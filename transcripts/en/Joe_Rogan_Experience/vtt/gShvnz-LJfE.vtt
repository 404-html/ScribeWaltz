00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.680
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're live a welcome aboard.</v>

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Jessica Rosenworcel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I do it?</v>

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so nervous about that.</v>

6
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>And Eddie won,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

7
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 1>has been on the podcast many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one podcast in the world.</v>

8
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.371
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

9
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up brother?</v>

10
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm chilling man.</v>

11
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

12
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to introduce you to the Homie,</v>

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>the commissioner from the FCC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jessica Rosenworcel because things,</v>

14
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>things where things are bad for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet right now.</v>

15
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Well you are very concerned and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are about net neutrality and uh,</v>

16
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>we all have some questions about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're excited to talk to you about it.</v>

17
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>So maybe we could eliminate some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues and,</v>

18
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>and give us a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an understanding or try to help us</v>

19
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>understand what's at stake here and why</v>
<v Speaker 1>are people so concerned?</v>

20
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people are concerned because the</v>

21
00:00:56.511 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Speaker 2>future of the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the future of everything.</v>

22
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every aspect of our lives is now touched</v>

23
00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 2>by that connectivity and it's a funny</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

24
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.160
<v Speaker 2>but the agency where I work in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>

25
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:12.161
<v Speaker 2>the Federal Communications Commission</v>
<v Speaker 2>has enormous power and control over our</v>

26
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:16.760
<v Speaker 2>internet experience and for decades</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had these policies that have been</v>

27
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.720
<v Speaker 2>all about Internet openness and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means is you can go where you want,</v>

28
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.640
<v Speaker 2>do what you want online and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>broadband provider can't get in the way</v>

29
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.530
<v Speaker 2>or prevent you from looking at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>websites are looking at some videos or</v>

30
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:34.970
<v Speaker 2>setting up some businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that changed last month in</v>

31
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:39.971
<v Speaker 2>Washington when the FCC over my</v>
<v Speaker 2>objections voted to end net neutrality</v>

32
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.090
<v Speaker 2>and as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of our broadband providers now have</v>

33
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:52.091
<v Speaker 2>the legal right to block websites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to throttle content,</v>

34
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.940
<v Speaker 2>and to set up sweetheart paid for</v>
<v Speaker 2>prioritization deals and over the long</v>

35
00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:01.610
<v Speaker 2>haul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could really change the Internet</v>

36
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.140
<v Speaker 2>and the web as we know it.</v>

37
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the arguments?</v>

38
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Pro Net neutrality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the arguments for people that</v>

39
00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:12.740
<v Speaker 1>were excited about this being signed</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were saying that net</v>

40
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:17.741
<v Speaker 1>neutrality was really only over the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years and before the last</v>

41
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.840
<v Speaker 1>couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>net neutrality as we know it the last</v>

42
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was fine and that it'll</v>

43
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.000
<v Speaker 1>continue to be fine and that people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>just panicked and there was that really</v>

44
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:30.020
<v Speaker 1>bizarre video that that one dude made</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he was sharing that these are all</v>

45
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:31.340
<v Speaker 1>the things you're going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

46
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.780
<v Speaker 1>You work with that cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a pie.</v>

47
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems like an odd fellow.</v>

48
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

50
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

51
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.100
<v Speaker 2>he's a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a seasoned lawyer.</v>

52
00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fair to say he and I see</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world a little bit</v>

53
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.353
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>So he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sees this through the eyes of big</v>

55
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:51.451
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

56
00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:56.451
<v Speaker 1>He thinks that this is a free market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let the market decide and um,</v>

57
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

58
00:02:58.171 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>I've even heard mark Cuban was</v>

59
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 3>arguing against it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was like,</v>

60
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is stunning.</v>

61
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Noodle.</v>

62
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the net neutrality thing is huge because</v>

63
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 3>when I was in law school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read this one book called fighting for</v>

64
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:13.800
<v Speaker 3>air and it documented like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>telecommunications act in [inaudible]</v>

65
00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 3>97.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like boring stuff,</v>

66
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't go read the Telecommunications Act</v>

67
00:03:17.671 --> 00:03:20.360
<v Speaker 3>in [inaudible] 97,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like radio mattered to me.</v>

68
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Remember like growing up with the radio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I remember they would actually</v>

69
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 3>break records on the radio back in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

70
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 3>like funk flux still does it on hot 97</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he'll break records.</v>

71
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 3>He broke my boy old drew's record the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other day,</v>

72
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 3>but like recently it's like clear</v>
<v Speaker 3>channel Iheartradio.</v>

73
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 3>They own all the radio stations and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>really sterilized content and they play</v>

74
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 3>the same songs every hour in every city</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost around the world.</v>

75
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 3>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I read that book and I went to law</v>

76
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized I was like,</v>

77
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was because of the deregulation of</v>

78
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:59.041
<v Speaker 3>radio that allowed for all these local</v>
<v Speaker 3>independent radio stations in every city</v>

79
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 3>that we're wrapping local culture and</v>
<v Speaker 3>state culture.</v>

80
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 3>That kind of eroded that means of</v>
<v Speaker 3>communication.</v>

81
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this happens to every single industry we</v>

82
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's radio,</v>

83
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:13.750
<v Speaker 3>television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now it's coming for the Internet and</v>

84
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 3>by deregulating it you're gonna gut it</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

85
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.020
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when,</v>

86
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 3>when technology started popping in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast came around.</v>

87
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what enabled jre and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why my first place to goes like</v>

88
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm a come see jail because you were one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the innovators with this new</v>

89
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:31.024
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>

90
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.413
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

91
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.500
<v Speaker 3>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think what people are super</v>

92
00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:39.930
<v Speaker 3>concerned about is things getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>blocked,</v>

93
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like one of the first ones.</v>

94
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.020
<v Speaker 3>Is that something that we legitimately</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to worry,</v>

95
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.853
<v Speaker 3>I worry about?</v>

96
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>

97
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I know right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your broadband provider has the</v>

98
00:04:52.101 --> 00:04:55.940
<v Speaker 2>technical ability to block content and</v>
<v Speaker 2>websites.</v>

99
00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.430
<v Speaker 2>It's got the business incentive to block</v>
<v Speaker 2>or slow access to some websites if they</v>

100
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.710
<v Speaker 2>don't have a special commercial</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with them.</v>

101
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.010
<v Speaker 2>So now the FCC just gave them the legal</v>
<v Speaker 2>green.</v>

102
00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go ahead.</v>

103
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.060
<v Speaker 2>And so I feel over time this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>something we need to be concerned about.</v>

104
00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:16.520
<v Speaker 2>And so this open platform that was full</v>
<v Speaker 2>of independent,</v>

105
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.960
<v Speaker 2>independent voices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you've got this new gatekeeper,</v>

106
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 2>your broadband provider,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got a lot more power than what</v>

107
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.660
<v Speaker 2>they used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How close was the vote?</v>

108
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.370
<v Speaker 2>It was three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two.</v>

109
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.840
<v Speaker 2>And what's the argument for this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

110
00:05:32.841 --> 00:05:33.710
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fair.</v>

111
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's an argument that you</v>

112
00:05:36.951 --> 00:05:40.610
<v Speaker 2>want government out of the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>deregulation is going to lead to more</v>

113
00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:45.611
<v Speaker 2>competition and we'll have a flourishing</v>
<v Speaker 2>of new ideas and content if we just</v>

114
00:05:46.431 --> 00:05:47.690
<v Speaker 2>moved government out of the way.</v>

115
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.810
<v Speaker 2>And even if you're sympathetic to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>

116
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.080
<v Speaker 2>here's where I think it breaks down</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to the FCC,</v>

117
00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 2>his own data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half of the households this country</v>

118
00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.390
<v Speaker 2>don't have a choice of broadband</v>
<v Speaker 2>provider.</v>

119
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 2>I am familiar with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of them,</v>

120
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 2>only have one provider that serves my</v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

121
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 2>So the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a broadband provider started</v>

122
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 2>blocking your content or throttling your</v>
<v Speaker 2>access to some video in a competitive</v>

123
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 2>market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd pick up,</v>

124
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 2>you take your business somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But about half of our households don't</v>

125
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 2>even have that opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to me,</v>

126
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:25.031
<v Speaker 2>the idea that the competitive market</v>
<v Speaker 2>will prevent this behavior just doesn't</v>

127
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:25.934
<v Speaker 2>fly.</v>

128
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem to make sense.</v>

129
00:06:27.731 --> 00:06:29.530
<v Speaker 1>And that that's an issue in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood as well.</v>

130
00:06:29.531 --> 00:06:31.180
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of other people I know as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

131
00:06:31.181 --> 00:06:34.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they make deals where only one</v>

132
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.700
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's verizon or whatever,</v>

133
00:06:36.701 --> 00:06:37.660
<v Speaker 1>has an area.</v>

134
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They monopolize the areas.</v>

135
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 3>They limit the opportunities and choices</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when they say deregulation,</v>

136
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.790
<v Speaker 3>it just anytime they deregulate things</v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

137
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to leave it to the market</v>

138
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 3>and have competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's impossible to have that</v>

139
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:53.360
<v Speaker 3>when you have a country with such an</v>
<v Speaker 3>inequality,</v>

140
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 3>income inequality gap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

141
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.280
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem is that all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's all go compete Joe.</v>

142
00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to start a verizon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to start a verizon.</v>

143
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we can't compete with these dudes</v>

144
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 3>and even comcast can't even compete with</v>
<v Speaker 3>verizon.</v>

145
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.390
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these dudes were all getting smashed.</v>

146
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 3>So there is not actual competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think deregulation works when you have</v>

147
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 3>multiple players and options and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the market actually can come into play.</v>

148
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 3>But with the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so top heavy right now,</v>

149
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there is a possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>

150
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean listen,</v>

151
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.250
<v Speaker 2>competition is the best regulator we</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

152
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want there to be these markets where</v>

153
00:07:28.411 --> 00:07:33.300
<v Speaker 2>consumers have lots and lots of choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if competition is an existing,</v>

154
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.780
<v Speaker 2>you need a little oversight to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>that every consumer gets a fair shot.</v>

155
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like that's where the real</v>

156
00:07:38.321 --> 00:07:40.750
<v Speaker 1>argument lies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if there are monopolies and there</v>

157
00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:45.730
<v Speaker 1>seemed to be in certain areas with in</v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to what kind of Internet access</v>

158
00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:49.150
<v Speaker 1>you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you don't have regulation,</v>

159
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:52.240
<v Speaker 1>then then what is going to protect the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumer and what is going to protect</v>

160
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.610
<v Speaker 1>free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going to protect it?</v>

161
00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Say if you are on verizon and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>system is on verizon,</v>

162
00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.990
<v Speaker 1>what have you decided to make a podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>that criticizes verizon and everybody</v>

163
00:08:01.991 --> 00:08:02.440
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.090
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie [inaudible] got a podcast</v>

165
00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:05.980
<v Speaker 1>criticizing us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to shut that down.</v>

166
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.023
<v Speaker 1>And they can just.</v>

167
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.950
<v Speaker 3>I would have been shut down a long time</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

168
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

169
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.610
<v Speaker 2>We're not saying that they would do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

170
00:08:12.611 --> 00:08:14.150
<v Speaker 2>but they could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

171
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.540
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's scary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not good,</v>

172
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much of our speech these days,</v>

173
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.900
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take place in public places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes place on these private</v>

174
00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:26.770
<v Speaker 2>platforms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have a lot of power and we have</v>

175
00:08:26.771 --> 00:08:29.440
<v Speaker 2>to think about that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a country in a democracy,</v>

176
00:08:29.441 --> 00:08:34.420
<v Speaker 2>how much openness do we want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then how do we create a framework in</v>

177
00:08:34.421 --> 00:08:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Washington that supports that openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really to me what net</v>

178
00:08:37.541 --> 00:08:38.374
<v Speaker 2>neutrality is.</v>

179
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.560
<v Speaker 3>The other question I have is right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say I'm the,</v>

180
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:47.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus let's say a service provider Buys</v>

181
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.320
<v Speaker 3>Hulu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

182
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.780
<v Speaker 3>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they buy or they create their own</v>

183
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 3>streaming platform called Zulu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

184
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.780
<v Speaker 3>So they start Zulu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could start to charge netflix more</v>

185
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 3>money for using their service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could charge more money,</v>

186
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 3>they could charge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

187
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 3>beats more money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

188
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.800
<v Speaker 3>so that they have an advantage for their</v>
<v Speaker 3>own streaming services in,</v>

189
00:09:09.801 --> 00:09:13.140
<v Speaker 3>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way they can culturally control</v>

190
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.850
<v Speaker 3>content.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

191
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 3>you're so right.</v>

192
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 2>And what happens is you as a consumer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just get online and you might not</v>

193
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:20.700
<v Speaker 2>even notice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

194
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 2>You might not even notice they're taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to the video content that they have</v>

195
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:29.841
<v Speaker 2>a special pay for relationship with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think though the biggest harm is to</v>

196
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:31.480
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

197
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.041
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

198
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:33.450
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a good idea.</v>

199
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 2>You got a business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a service.</v>

200
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 2>You can go online and you can almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>instantly have global reach.</v>

201
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.990
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now you're going to have to figure</v>

202
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:47.991
<v Speaker 2>out is your broadband provider instead</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to shuffle off all your traffic to</v>

203
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:50.370
<v Speaker 2>someone else who's paying them on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>side?</v>

204
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to have a fair shot to</v>
<v Speaker 2>show your wares and your ideas to the</v>

205
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:55.090
<v Speaker 2>world?</v>

206
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:59.250
<v Speaker 3>It's harder because I start thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a bad one percenter,</v>

207
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.011
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

208
00:10:00.011 --> 00:10:02.860
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's no net neutrality and I'm the</v>

209
00:10:02.861 --> 00:10:06.160
<v Speaker 3>only person that can service Calabasas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>

210
00:10:06.161 --> 00:10:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Woodland Hills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>

211
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.650
<v Speaker 3>well I'm going to charge all the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>streaming providers more money to use</v>

212
00:10:11.651 --> 00:10:15.370
<v Speaker 3>this and I'm going to create a</v>
<v Speaker 3>competitor and every single one of these</v>

213
00:10:15.371 --> 00:10:19.930
<v Speaker 3>sectors so you can have an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have your show with me and if</v>

214
00:10:19.931 --> 00:10:22.060
<v Speaker 3>you're on the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to disadvantage you.</v>

215
00:10:22.061 --> 00:10:23.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tax you basically.</v>

216
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.440
<v Speaker 1>So right now these are concerns and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that's actually</v>

217
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 1>happening yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this.</v>

218
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.990
<v Speaker 1>This ruling was just passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

219
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Are there any plans in place for things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we should be concerned with and is</v>

220
00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:43.860
<v Speaker 1>there anything that we can do about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>current ruling?</v>

221
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's loads because I'm not giving up</v>

222
00:10:47.751 --> 00:10:50.600
<v Speaker 2>and the fight for net neutrality and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want you to either.</v>

223
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.790
<v Speaker 2>We got a few different pathways ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First in Congress right now,</v>

224
00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.670
<v Speaker 2>they are trying to get rid of what just</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened at the FCC.</v>

225
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.140
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to use this law called</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Congressional Review Act that an</v>

226
00:11:06.141 --> 00:11:09.260
<v Speaker 2>effect just undid everything that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>FCC just did.</v>

227
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:14.330
<v Speaker 2>So it's a way to wipe out what just</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and while the odds are long,</v>

228
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:19.220
<v Speaker 2>there's more than 40 United States</v>
<v Speaker 2>senators who have sponsored that law and</v>

229
00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:23.120
<v Speaker 2>in the house side there's more than 80</v>
<v Speaker 2>members of the House of Representatives.</v>

230
00:11:23.121 --> 00:11:28.070
<v Speaker 2>So there's momentum growing in Congress</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take a look at this issue and maybe</v>

231
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.190
<v Speaker 2>fixed what the FCC did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're sitting out there and</v>

232
00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:34.970
<v Speaker 2>thinking they're not listening to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should do something totally old</v>

233
00:11:34.971 --> 00:11:36.800
<v Speaker 2>fashioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should pick up the phone,</v>

234
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.070
<v Speaker 2>call your members of Congress and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>representatives and let them know you</v>

235
00:11:40.071 --> 00:11:44.600
<v Speaker 2>care about this issue because that still</v>
<v Speaker 2>today is one of the most powerful ways</v>

236
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.270
<v Speaker 2>of conveying your opinion to those who</v>
<v Speaker 2>represent you.</v>

237
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.630
<v Speaker 2>When is the vote happening on that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not yet scheduled.</v>

238
00:11:50.631 --> 00:11:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to happen first in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States Senate and later in</v>

239
00:11:54.971 --> 00:11:58.720
<v Speaker 2>the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think we are going to have</v>

240
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.320
<v Speaker 2>litigation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've already got a few states attorneys</v>

241
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 2>general who want a sued to overturn</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

242
00:12:04.211 --> 00:12:06.850
<v Speaker 2>We've got some big companies and public</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest groups,</v>

243
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 2>so I think it's fair to say we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to court and then we're also seeing</v>

244
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:16.900
<v Speaker 2>activity in state houses and that we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen net neutrality legislation</v>

245
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:19.750
<v Speaker 2>introduced in Nebraska,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevada,</v>

246
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.970
<v Speaker 2>Washington state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts,</v>

247
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.490
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of places,</v>

248
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.100
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not sure how that all comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>together legally,</v>

249
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:29.320
<v Speaker 2>but what you see as this momentum</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing,</v>

250
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.260
<v Speaker 2>that people are not happy with what</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington just did.</v>

251
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.010
<v Speaker 3>The thing that I'm worried about with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the state's laws.</v>

252
00:12:35.011 --> 00:12:36.870
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so just to lay it out for the listeners,</v>

253
00:12:36.871 --> 00:12:37.950
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's people will,</v>

254
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.020
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government will pass the federal</v>

255
00:12:40.021 --> 00:12:42.450
<v Speaker 3>law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then states have their own rights to</v>

256
00:12:42.451 --> 00:12:46.200
<v Speaker 3>regulate certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say we use marijuana laws as an</v>

257
00:12:46.201 --> 00:12:50.700
<v Speaker 3>example because recently a lot of states</v>
<v Speaker 3>past legal marijuana laws,</v>

258
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then trump gave people the power to</v>

259
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:58.080
<v Speaker 3>enforce federal laws about marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 3>more stringently.</v>

260
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.510
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was telling the federal government,</v>

261
00:13:00.511 --> 00:13:03.000
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enforce our federal marijuana laws.</v>

262
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.220
<v Speaker 3>What's really jeff sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

263
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.530
<v Speaker 3>Chefs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

264
00:13:07.531 --> 00:13:12.330
<v Speaker 3>his goon is doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so how would federalism work if</v>

265
00:13:12.331 --> 00:13:16.980
<v Speaker 3>states started to pass their own net</v>
<v Speaker 3>neutrality laws versus the the,</v>

266
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.130
<v Speaker 3>the FCC Commissioner Orleans,</v>

267
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are hard questions.</v>

268
00:13:20.701 --> 00:13:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd go right to the constitution.</v>

269
00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:25.410
<v Speaker 2>What's interstate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's within the state's authority,</v>

270
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.060
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just standing back and seeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>really just a lot of energy on this</v>

271
00:13:30.061 --> 00:13:32.670
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing else that I've worked on</v>

272
00:13:32.671 --> 00:13:37.671
<v Speaker 2>in Washington where this immediately</v>
<v Speaker 2>statehouses decided to put pen to paper</v>

273
00:13:38.071 --> 00:13:41.880
<v Speaker 2>and introduce legislation and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that momentum is what's really</v>

274
00:13:41.881 --> 00:13:42.714
<v Speaker 2>exciting here.</v>

275
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone understands the insane</v>

276
00:13:46.111 --> 00:13:51.111
<v Speaker 1>power of the Internet and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a cultural shift that we've</v>

277
00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:55.110
<v Speaker 1>experienced over the last 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's unprecedented in human</v>

278
00:13:55.111 --> 00:13:56.760
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never been anything like it in</v>

279
00:13:56.761 --> 00:14:00.210
<v Speaker 1>terms of access to information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the rate of change,</v>

280
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.210
<v Speaker 1>the way people look at things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the issues get discussed,</v>

281
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.100
<v Speaker 1>the cycle of news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

282
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.570
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 hours now?</v>

283
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Stories come in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Hawaii just had a fake missile</v>

284
00:14:11.161 --> 00:14:15.150
<v Speaker 1>attack and everybody already forgot it</v>
<v Speaker 1>already onto the next like what's the</v>

285
00:14:15.151 --> 00:14:17.490
<v Speaker 1>next thing we posted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check my phone because I think we have</v>

286
00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:21.000
<v Speaker 1>to fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should certainly happened in Hawaii.</v>

287
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Someone went crazy.</v>

288
00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Still learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it was a state level</v>

289
00:14:25.921 --> 00:14:28.080
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't have things like that</v>

290
00:14:28.081 --> 00:14:30.540
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to figure out a way in this</v>

291
00:14:30.541 --> 00:14:35.541
<v Speaker 2>digital world that we get accurate</v>
<v Speaker 2>information to people faster and we we</v>

292
00:14:35.551 --> 00:14:37.650
<v Speaker 2>got to come up with better systems than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one we just saw.</v>

293
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.400
<v Speaker 1>You need somebody pressed a button and</v>
<v Speaker 1>send out a text that said that there's</v>

294
00:14:41.401 --> 00:14:45.420
<v Speaker 1>an incoming ballistic missile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a possibility of threat of an</v>

295
00:14:45.421 --> 00:14:47.370
<v Speaker 1>incoming ballistic missile and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a drill.</v>

296
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.610
<v Speaker 1>And then I have friends in Hawaii and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone went crazy.</v>

297
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.880
<v Speaker 1>People were crying in the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one knew what to do.</v>

298
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.430
<v Speaker 1>And of course this is a state that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked,</v>

299
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less than 100 years ago during World War</v>

300
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is not an unusual thing for</v>

301
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:01.220
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

302
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had the privilege of working for</v>

303
00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:06.680
<v Speaker 4>senator in a way from Hawaii years ago</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think Hawaiians are,</v>

304
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're graceful.</v>

305
00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:11.390
<v Speaker 4>They're resilient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they live with the knowledge that</v>

306
00:15:11.391 --> 00:15:15.740
<v Speaker 4>they are susceptible to some attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this gave them 40 minutes,</v>

307
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.670
<v Speaker 4>40 minutes of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the amazing thing to me is it took</v>

308
00:15:19.671 --> 00:15:23.000
<v Speaker 4>like 10 minutes or so for this to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>corrected on twitter.</v>

309
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.750
<v Speaker 4>Took,</v>
<v Speaker 4>took off another half hour for our</v>

310
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:30.290
<v Speaker 4>official systems to update and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in fact this was a mistake.</v>

311
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once we found out,</v>

312
00:15:31.581 --> 00:15:33.740
<v Speaker 4>figure that out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let that happen.</v>

313
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then once I figured out it was a</v>

314
00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:36.801
<v Speaker 4>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

315
00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:39.050
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I should ask Jessica if we could</v>

316
00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:42.050
<v Speaker 4>send like a national message on my</v>
<v Speaker 4>birthday.</v>

317
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:43.190
<v Speaker 4>12 am,</v>
<v Speaker 4>March first,</v>

318
00:15:43.191 --> 00:15:46.940
<v Speaker 4>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you up just a nationwide booty call.</v>

319
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.970
<v Speaker 4>The FCC will not be helping in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>regard.</v>

320
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.140
<v Speaker 4>I had to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big question,</v>

321
00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.580
<v Speaker 4>but what Joe was saying about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet and how it opened things up</v>

322
00:15:58.581 --> 00:16:02.060
<v Speaker 4>like personally for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like today's Martin Luther King Jr Day.</v>

323
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:03.170
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

324
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.650
<v Speaker 4>I remember reading letter from</v>
<v Speaker 4>Birmingham jail as a kid,</v>

325
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.590
<v Speaker 4>Johnathan swift,</v>
<v Speaker 4>modest proposal as a kid and Tupac a me</v>

326
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.160
<v Speaker 4>against world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those were like the three works that</v>

327
00:16:13.161 --> 00:16:17.180
<v Speaker 4>made me want to write.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I started writing since I was 15</v>

328
00:16:17.181 --> 00:16:18.590
<v Speaker 4>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never gave up,</v>

329
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.930
<v Speaker 4>but no one would buy my writing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

330
00:16:20.931 --> 00:16:24.770
<v Speaker 4>The only place that would by my writing</v>
<v Speaker 4>was roto wire and I would write fantasy</v>

331
00:16:24.771 --> 00:16:27.650
<v Speaker 4>sports updates for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I covered the magic and I covered the</v>

332
00:16:27.651 --> 00:16:30.980
<v Speaker 4>knicks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all the way until I was like 28</v>

333
00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:33.560
<v Speaker 4>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one wanted to buy my writing.</v>

334
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:38.590
<v Speaker 4>It was blog spot that it allowed me to</v>
<v Speaker 4>write in my own voice and find my own</v>

335
00:16:39.111 --> 00:16:41.690
<v Speaker 4>audience and then people started to see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

336
00:16:41.691 --> 00:16:45.950
<v Speaker 4>there are like weird children on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet that like Eddie's writing,</v>

337
00:16:45.951 --> 00:16:50.140
<v Speaker 4>like he's creating a lane and I talked</v>
<v Speaker 4>to my publisher at Random House and they</v>

338
00:16:50.141 --> 00:16:50.571
<v Speaker 4>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

339
00:16:50.571 --> 00:16:53.510
<v Speaker 4>you created a lane selling books to</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who don't buy books,</v>

340
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.600
<v Speaker 4>non traditional readers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so without the Internet,</v>

341
00:16:56.601 --> 00:16:59.960
<v Speaker 4>without blogspot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>without that ability to just project my</v>

342
00:16:59.961 --> 00:17:02.810
<v Speaker 4>voice and hope someone connects like I</v>
<v Speaker 4>never would have happened.</v>

343
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.730
<v Speaker 4>I know we're living through it in real</v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

344
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.020
<v Speaker 4>but it is totally radical as a matter of</v>
<v Speaker 4>human history that you can reach out,</v>

345
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:13.610
<v Speaker 4>reach around the world and build</v>
<v Speaker 4>community with total disregard for</v>

346
00:17:13.611 --> 00:17:18.611
<v Speaker 4>geography and find people who like</v>
<v Speaker 4>fantasy sports or something like that</v>

347
00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:24.380
<v Speaker 4>and and build community around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an extraordinary thing and it has</v>

348
00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:27.110
<v Speaker 4>no precedent in human culture</v>

349
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.590
<v Speaker 1>and with translation software.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now language is no longer even a</v>

350
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:33.590
<v Speaker 1>barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's changing and shifting as as</v>

351
00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:36.050
<v Speaker 1>we speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new technologies are being developed.</v>

352
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean Samsung has a phone now that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>note eight where you could just</v>

353
00:17:40.461 --> 00:17:42.620
<v Speaker 1>highlight something and instantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>translated.</v>

354
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have earbuds where you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>put that on the pixel where if you talk</v>

355
00:17:47.811 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 1>to me in Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll hear it in English and this is</v>

356
00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:52.480
<v Speaker 1>crazy stuff and this is all changed.</v>

357
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.300
<v Speaker 2>That does for commerce or diplomacy or</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ability to talk to me across the</v>

358
00:17:57.301 --> 00:18:00.990
<v Speaker 2>table without having a translator in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some clunky way.</v>

359
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Try to describe what I just said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These things are amazing and you want</v>

360
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:10.530
<v Speaker 2>all of our collective genius to drive</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and not have big Cape gatekeepers</v>

361
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:12.120
<v Speaker 2>like our broadband providers in the way.</v>

362
00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be a real issue and I think</v>

363
00:18:14.841 --> 00:18:19.820
<v Speaker 1>that we should look at the internet as</v>
<v Speaker 1>something different than almost all</v>

364
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.540
<v Speaker 1>other services because it is our</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>

365
00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:27.230
<v Speaker 1>It directly affects our ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve as a culture,</v>

366
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.260
<v Speaker 1>our ability to exchange information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

367
00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:35.380
<v Speaker 1>it's so critical and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so unprecedented and this is a very</v>

368
00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.080
<v Speaker 1>powerful thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would love to have it go back to</v>

369
00:18:40.081 --> 00:18:44.330
<v Speaker 1>the old way and have you get your news</v>
<v Speaker 1>on ABC and NBC and CBS and that's it.</v>

370
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.250
<v Speaker 1>People would love that because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>control you.</v>

371
00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

372
00:18:47.301 --> 00:18:49.490
<v Speaker 1>it would be way easier to keep the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

373
00:18:49.491 --> 00:18:51.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>informed in the way that they would</v>

374
00:18:51.681 --> 00:18:52.650
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

375
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.610
<v Speaker 2>it will be easier for regulators in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington too.</v>

376
00:18:55.611 --> 00:18:57.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just disorderly chaos on the</v>

377
00:18:57.951 --> 00:18:59.450
<v Speaker 2>internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

378
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.350
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

379
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.280
<v Speaker 2>it create it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

380
00:19:01.281 --> 00:19:05.360
<v Speaker 2>it has challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's unearthed communities and</v>

381
00:19:05.361 --> 00:19:10.190
<v Speaker 2>created economic possibility for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nothing in our history.</v>

382
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it just,</v>

383
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.810
<v Speaker 1>it's changing who humans are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

384
00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.610
<v Speaker 1>I think there's more of an understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>of each other.</v>

385
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.430
<v Speaker 1>There's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more compassion.</v>

386
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also a lot of hate and there's a</v>

387
00:19:21.021 --> 00:19:26.021
<v Speaker 1>lot of anger and there's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think with the bad there's more</v>

388
00:19:26.751 --> 00:19:29.960
<v Speaker 1>good yet undoubtedly there's much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

389
00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:32.900
<v Speaker 1>And to me it feels like a freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech issue,</v>

390
00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's if,</v>

391
00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:39.290
<v Speaker 1>if this internet kind of super highways</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled and there's toll booths</v>

392
00:19:39.291 --> 00:19:41.110
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and it gets privatized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

393
00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Florida,</v>

394
00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:45.320
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have money for roads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw when things got privatized,</v>

395
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.470
<v Speaker 1>it's you just pay more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the same service.</v>

396
00:19:48.471 --> 00:19:50.480
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things like it has to</v>

397
00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:53.240
<v Speaker 1>be regulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be protected and it has to be</v>

398
00:19:53.241 --> 00:19:55.910
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed as a thing for all human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

399
00:19:55.911 --> 00:19:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Not even just Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

400
00:19:57.471 --> 00:20:00.350
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's stunning to me how many people are</v>

401
00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.650
<v Speaker 1>against the idea of having an open</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet.</v>

402
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.293
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

403
00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.201
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

404
00:20:06.201 --> 00:20:08.690
<v Speaker 2>most of the polling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think polls are always,</v>

405
00:20:08.691 --> 00:20:09.650
<v Speaker 2>you got to be careful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

406
00:20:09.651 --> 00:20:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Because they can ask a question one way</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get an answer.</v>

407
00:20:12.111 --> 00:20:16.250
<v Speaker 2>But the best one done was right before</v>
<v Speaker 2>our boat by the University of Maryland.</v>

408
00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.960
<v Speaker 2>80 three percent of the public supported</v>
<v Speaker 2>net neutrality opposed what we were</v>

409
00:20:20.961 --> 00:20:21.670
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

410
00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.730
<v Speaker 1>But who are those 17 percent dummies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to know.</v>

411
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.970
<v Speaker 1>I think anything you can get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American public to agree to at 83</v>

412
00:20:27.971 --> 00:20:30.130
<v Speaker 1>percent is a pretty high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's wonderful,</v>

413
00:20:30.131 --> 00:20:34.420
<v Speaker 1>but I'm stunned to meet the 17 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

414
00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.090
<v Speaker 1>but isn't there a bunch of people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's some,</v>

415
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.970
<v Speaker 1>and I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about this on twitter recently</v>

416
00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:43.840
<v Speaker 1>without judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that net neutrality seems to me</v>

417
00:20:43.841 --> 00:20:48.730
<v Speaker 1>to be one of those ideological issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>where if you're on the right,</v>

418
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.910
<v Speaker 1>you support it or if you're on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather you support it where you're on</v>

419
00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:55.930
<v Speaker 1>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would like to go away.</v>

420
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.310
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like totally</v>

421
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.970
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you give you are a Democrat or</v>

422
00:21:00.971 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Republican?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You benefit from net neutrality and</v>

423
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:05.830
<v Speaker 2>internet openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're conservative or liberal,</v>

424
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.720
<v Speaker 2>if you're a big business or a small</v>
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

425
00:21:07.721 --> 00:21:12.721
<v Speaker 2>you benefit from Internet openness and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the history of net neutrality is</v>

426
00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:15.130
<v Speaker 2>something that doesn't get discussed</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

427
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:20.670
<v Speaker 2>which is that it began the first time</v>
<v Speaker 2>the FCC put net neutrality policy on</v>

428
00:21:20.681 --> 00:21:24.580
<v Speaker 2>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was 2005 and I'm old enough to</v>

429
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:28.060
<v Speaker 2>remember that that was when President</v>
<v Speaker 2>George W dot Bush was in the White</v>

430
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.080
<v Speaker 2>House.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

431
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.760
<v Speaker 2>this country's first net neutrality</v>
<v Speaker 2>policies were put on paper.</v>

432
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:39.270
<v Speaker 2>One of republican was running the FCC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is only in recent days.</v>

433
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.730
<v Speaker 2>We have characterized this as a left</v>
<v Speaker 2>right issue and I think that's a</v>

434
00:21:42.731 --> 00:21:45.400
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did it happen?</v>

435
00:21:45.401 --> 00:21:50.401
<v Speaker 2>Like when when object Pi proposed this</v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation and passed it,</v>

436
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.670
<v Speaker 2>it baffled me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought net neutrality was a thing we</v>

437
00:21:54.671 --> 00:21:55.480
<v Speaker 2>had all agreed on.</v>

438
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.980
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're never touching this.</v>

439
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.740
<v Speaker 2>How did this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

440
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through a whole bunch of boring</v>

441
00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Washington procedures whereby they</v>
<v Speaker 2>circulate our proposed rulemaking.</v>

442
00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:08.680
<v Speaker 2>How did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did he get the power and leverage to</v>

443
00:22:08.681 --> 00:22:13.681
<v Speaker 2>pass this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that he was supported by people</v>

444
00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:17.200
<v Speaker 2>in Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including some broadband providers and</v>

445
00:22:17.201 --> 00:22:22.120
<v Speaker 2>was led to believe that with</v>
<v Speaker 2>deregulation we would all be better off.</v>

446
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:24.970
<v Speaker 2>And then what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

447
00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:28.000
<v Speaker 2>What I find interesting is Google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon,</v>

448
00:22:28.001 --> 00:22:29.140
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

449
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.340
<v Speaker 2>these big power players used to be very</v>
<v Speaker 2>vocal net neutrality,</v>

450
00:22:33.341 --> 00:22:35.170
<v Speaker 2>keep the internet free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

451
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:40.030
<v Speaker 2>They're not as loud as they used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They seem to just be quiet on it.</v>

452
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.460
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

453
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:45.940
<v Speaker 2>first I want to point out that those big</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies through their association are</v>

454
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.600
<v Speaker 2>gonna be intervening in the lawsuits in</v>
<v Speaker 2>favor of net neutrality.</v>

455
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's true.</v>

456
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to me net neutrality has never</v>

457
00:22:53.021 --> 00:22:57.040
<v Speaker 2>really been about big companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about who's going to be the next</v>

458
00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.550
<v Speaker 2>digital platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's going to be the next startup and</v>

459
00:23:00.551 --> 00:23:03.790
<v Speaker 2>the next player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the big companies can always find</v>

460
00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:08.791
<v Speaker 2>ways to build relationships and manage</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of lack of neutrality online</v>

461
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.860
<v Speaker 2>with their leverage that come from size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

462
00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a question of who's going to start</v>
<v Speaker 2>something up that you and I may not see</v>

463
00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:18.040
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't pay off their</v>
<v Speaker 2>broadband provider.</v>

464
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.630
<v Speaker 2>It's the entrepreneurship that has me</v>
<v Speaker 2>most concerned likes new small business.</v>

465
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when I was saying that there's a.</v>

466
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.880
<v Speaker 1>seems like an ideological rift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain people that are not very</v>

467
00:23:29.881 --> 00:23:33.000
<v Speaker 1>well versed in this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that automatically side one way or</v>

468
00:23:33.001 --> 00:23:35.160
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a thing that we do in this</v>

469
00:23:35.161 --> 00:23:36.270
<v Speaker 1>country culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

470
00:23:36.271 --> 00:23:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Left thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it a lot with global warming.</v>

471
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Will you have a conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

472
00:23:40.231 --> 00:23:42.590
<v Speaker 1>They say that global warming's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so natural process,</v>

473
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.880
<v Speaker 1>natural cycle of the earth goes through</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and he talked to them about how much</v>

474
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:51.320
<v Speaker 1>research they've done on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost none if they fall into these</v>

475
00:23:51.321 --> 00:23:56.060
<v Speaker 1>ideological groups and those pull</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself up by your bootstraps,</v>

476
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.250
<v Speaker 1>right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

477
00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:01.490
<v Speaker 1>there's this sort of conservative way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that the let the market decide</v>

478
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.200
<v Speaker 1>and this is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that conversation.</v>

479
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's an honest</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation if you're dealing with</v>

480
00:24:05.931 --> 00:24:08.330
<v Speaker 1>monopolies in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in regards to Internet access,</v>

481
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.300
<v Speaker 1>which I think a lot of and I am and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

482
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.360
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a giant part of living in America.</v>

483
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that tribalism that you're</v>

484
00:24:16.441 --> 00:24:19.620
<v Speaker 2>describing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really deteriorating the quality of</v>

485
00:24:19.621 --> 00:24:23.250
<v Speaker 2>our dialogue in Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to find a way to fix it</v>

486
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.533
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

487
00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:29.580
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to move ahead without</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually having some back and forth on</v>

488
00:24:29.581 --> 00:24:30.160
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>

489
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.840
<v Speaker 3>This is like the one issue where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

490
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.400
<v Speaker 3>it actually brings people together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>80 three percent of people support it.</v>

491
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.253
<v Speaker 3>Percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

492
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.350
<v Speaker 3>It's undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it.</v>

493
00:24:38.351 --> 00:24:40.360
<v Speaker 3>That's what's scary about this country</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

494
00:24:40.361 --> 00:24:43.120
<v Speaker 3>is that even when so many of us agree</v>
<v Speaker 3>about something,</v>

495
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.120
<v Speaker 3>when one very powerful group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lobby,</v>

496
00:24:46.121 --> 00:24:49.490
<v Speaker 3>the broadband companies get behind</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody with some control,</v>

497
00:24:49.491 --> 00:24:51.790
<v Speaker 3>like they can push the needle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

498
00:24:51.791 --> 00:24:52.780
<v Speaker 3>it's funny if you am I</v>

499
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:57.370
<v Speaker 2>email inbox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was an explosive thing leading up</v>

500
00:24:57.371 --> 00:25:02.371
<v Speaker 2>to this vote was full of people writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and telling me their stories,</v>

501
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.250
<v Speaker 2>but a whole bunch of that more like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

502
00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm a registered Republican but I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to know,</v>

503
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.730
<v Speaker 2>or I supported the president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I believe net neutrality is really</v>

504
00:25:12.731 --> 00:25:15.580
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was striking to me like once you get</v>

505
00:25:15.581 --> 00:25:18.820
<v Speaker 2>out of the talking head types.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

506
00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.680
<v Speaker 2>she found is that there was really broad</v>
<v Speaker 2>based support for net neutrality.</v>

507
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's stunning about this</v>

508
00:25:26.141 --> 00:25:30.280
<v Speaker 1>administration is how trump's</v>
<v Speaker 1>administration is just going ham for</v>

509
00:25:30.281 --> 00:25:33.250
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are going ham for offshore</v>

510
00:25:33.251 --> 00:25:37.090
<v Speaker 1>drilling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going ham for diminishing state</v>

511
00:25:37.091 --> 00:25:40.540
<v Speaker 1>parks and starting to tap into</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>

512
00:25:40.541 --> 00:25:42.970
<v Speaker 1>whether it's mining or fracking or</v>
<v Speaker 1>keynotes.</v>

513
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.430
<v Speaker 1>The world's gonna end in 25 years or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and he's like,</v>

514
00:25:45.431 --> 00:25:46.870
<v Speaker 1>just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take it all.</v>

515
00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have 25 years.</v>

516
00:25:49.121 --> 00:25:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the world is gonna end in 25</v>

517
00:25:51.311 --> 00:25:52.150
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

518
00:25:52.151 --> 00:25:55.210
<v Speaker 1>if you're a 72 year old guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much time do you have left?</v>

519
00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.480
<v Speaker 1>If you have 25 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those last 25 years,</v>

520
00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.830
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

521
00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:00.693
<v Speaker 1>you're barely there.</v>

522
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's insane.</v>

523
00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.240
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing going to be left after</v>
<v Speaker 3>this administration.</v>

524
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real weird.</v>

525
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:09.860
<v Speaker 1>It's because it lets you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people used to think,</v>

526
00:26:09.861 --> 00:26:11.090
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president is that much power.</v>

527
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Look at what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

528
00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:13.820
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

529
00:26:13.821 --> 00:26:18.800
<v Speaker 1>a giant shift in environmental policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Environmental Protection Agency has been</v>

530
00:26:18.801 --> 00:26:22.910
<v Speaker 1>gutted is that's the scary stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scary stuff is how much emphasis is</v>

531
00:26:22.911 --> 00:26:26.960
<v Speaker 1>placed on business and how little on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world in which we live.</v>

532
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to balance that out.</v>

533
00:26:28.641 --> 00:26:28.930
<v Speaker 1>It's also</v>

534
00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.540
<v Speaker 2>how we got to focus on the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

535
00:26:31.541 --> 00:26:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not a given that we're going to</v>

536
00:26:34.751 --> 00:26:38.680
<v Speaker 2>succeed in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we don't start planning and when I</v>

537
00:26:38.681 --> 00:26:40.900
<v Speaker 2>think about the world my kids are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to inherit,</v>

538
00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.430
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be digital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be consequences.</v>

539
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.640
<v Speaker 5>Why don't we start doing something about</v>
<v Speaker 5>that right now?</v>

540
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:53.220
<v Speaker 5>There's not a lot of urgency.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the weirdest parts of being</v>

541
00:26:53.221 --> 00:26:57.690
<v Speaker 5>a person as people look so short term</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they always feel like someone's</v>

542
00:26:57.691 --> 00:26:59.490
<v Speaker 5>gonna fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

543
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:00.331
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't that the,</v>

544
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:02.490
<v Speaker 5>the attitudes som was going to fix</v>
<v Speaker 5>bulger right now.</v>

545
00:27:02.491 --> 00:27:05.040
<v Speaker 5>The economy's booming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Java's test is at all time low and</v>

546
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:06.960
<v Speaker 5>they'll just start throwing all the good</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff your way.</v>

547
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:07.771
<v Speaker 5>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

548
00:27:07.771 --> 00:27:10.740
<v Speaker 5>when you just start raping the</v>
<v Speaker 5>environment and the business has go,</v>

549
00:27:10.741 --> 00:27:11.790
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a lot of process,</v>

550
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.220
<v Speaker 5>a profit to be made here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>

551
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:15.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's get going.</v>

552
00:27:15.391 --> 00:27:16.960
<v Speaker 5>Let's start hiring some people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

553
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.910
<v Speaker 5>It's like all the money goes to defense</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Department of Education is good at</v>

554
00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:23.730
<v Speaker 5>department of Energy has gutted</v>
<v Speaker 5>department of Environment's all these</v>

555
00:27:23.731 --> 00:27:26.340
<v Speaker 5>things are gutted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything that has to do with art,</v>

556
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.780
<v Speaker 5>even present and future,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's good at the,</v>

557
00:27:29.781 --> 00:27:32.280
<v Speaker 5>the only thing that's going on in his</v>
<v Speaker 5>business and defense.</v>

558
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.160
<v Speaker 5>And what's the argument for that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The argument for that is that as</v>

559
00:27:35.161 --> 00:27:38.340
<v Speaker 5>business booms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as the economy will be trickled down and</v>

560
00:27:38.341 --> 00:27:43.170
<v Speaker 5>they'll be more opportunities for</v>
<v Speaker 5>businesses to clean up the environment</v>

561
00:27:43.171 --> 00:27:46.500
<v Speaker 5>and profit off of it and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's never work.</v>

562
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.660
<v Speaker 5>Commissioner,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you like trickle down?</v>

563
00:27:48.661 --> 00:27:51.330
<v Speaker 5>Economics has never worked in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>history of the history.</v>

564
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.460
<v Speaker 5>I have my doubts about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

565
00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard every pro and con for it.</v>

566
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.010
<v Speaker 5>It's it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

567
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:02.520
<v Speaker 5>I think at the very least the trump</v>
<v Speaker 5>administration and I'm trying to look at</v>

568
00:28:02.521 --> 00:28:07.521
<v Speaker 5>it through rose colored glasses is a</v>
<v Speaker 5>fascinating experiment and in so many</v>

569
00:28:07.531 --> 00:28:12.060
<v Speaker 5>different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also I think made us all more</v>

570
00:28:12.061 --> 00:28:14.880
<v Speaker 5>conscious of our role as citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

571
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.960
<v Speaker 5>People have to talk back to Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have to speak up.</v>

572
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:24.330
<v Speaker 5>We need our representatives to hear what</v>
<v Speaker 5>people think and I think we got a little</v>

573
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:25.260
<v Speaker 5>comfortable there.</v>

574
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.080
<v Speaker 5>Believe in the system just runs by</v>
<v Speaker 5>itself,</v>

575
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.790
<v Speaker 5>but it does better when people</v>
<v Speaker 5>participate and I think that there's a</v>

576
00:28:32.791 --> 00:28:36.330
<v Speaker 5>lot more demanded of us now as citizens</v>
<v Speaker 5>no matter where you fall on the</v>

577
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:40.410
<v Speaker 5>political spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it woke us all up to that fact.</v>

578
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.260
<v Speaker 5>Besides just calling state reps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>senators,</v>

579
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.340
<v Speaker 5>what else can people do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

580
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.930
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>participate in letter writing campaigns,</v>

581
00:28:48.931 --> 00:28:51.570
<v Speaker 5>get things in your editorial page,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

582
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:56.280
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean a big papers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wrote something for the La Times about</v>

583
00:28:56.281 --> 00:28:57.840
<v Speaker 5>this awhile ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

584
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean in your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your local papers,</v>

585
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:04.380
<v Speaker 5>tell them why it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell them how you built a business using</v>

586
00:29:04.381 --> 00:29:09.270
<v Speaker 5>online activities and how maybe going</v>
<v Speaker 5>forward that's going to be a little</v>

587
00:29:09.271 --> 00:29:13.050
<v Speaker 5>harder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm making efforts to make sure</v>

588
00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:17.010
<v Speaker 5>that people understand this at a local</v>
<v Speaker 5>level is really powerful.</v>

589
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.630
<v Speaker 5>What's very disturbing to people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>320 million people can view how many we</v>

590
00:29:21.631 --> 00:29:23.070
<v Speaker 5>have 3:20,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere in there that,</v>

591
00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:27.060
<v Speaker 5>that can be affected by five people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy,</v>

592
00:29:27.061 --> 00:29:28.080
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's insane.</v>

593
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:33.170
<v Speaker 5>Five unelected bureaucrats because look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's who we are.</v>

594
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:38.560
<v Speaker 5>Have this extraordinary power over what</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can watch.</v>

595
00:29:38.561 --> 00:29:40.680
<v Speaker 5>So he hear and learn.</v>

596
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:46.510
<v Speaker 4>I think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something in that that strikes</v>

597
00:29:46.511 --> 00:29:48.910
<v Speaker 4>me is not right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the idea that in the end,</v>

598
00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:52.750
<v Speaker 4>just three of them voted to roll back</v>
<v Speaker 4>this open.</v>

599
00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:57.000
<v Speaker 1>So three people changed it for $320</v>
<v Speaker 1>million people.</v>

600
00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:00.540
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem like the end three</v>

601
00:30:00.541 --> 00:30:02.130
<v Speaker 1>people by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were not voted in.</v>

602
00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.730
<v Speaker 1>So they're unelected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was bananas.</v>

603
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no question about it.</v>

604
00:30:07.141 --> 00:30:09.930
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you gave people the option,</v>

605
00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:10.770
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

606
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:15.770
<v Speaker 1>do you think that five people should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to decide whether or not the 320</v>

607
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.060
<v Speaker 1>million plus plus the rest of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

608
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're a super podcast gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut off,</v>

609
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna be able to reach the</v>

610
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Canada either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you think that they should be</v>

611
00:30:25.261 --> 00:30:29.760
<v Speaker 1>able to stop access to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Information people define slide</v>

612
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.410
<v Speaker 4>83 percent of the American public to</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

613
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.100
<v Speaker 4>It's insane and that's the type of shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes me feel trapped in this</v>

614
00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:38.470
<v Speaker 4>country sometimes because we did an</v>
<v Speaker 4>elect these people,</v>

615
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:40.630
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

616
00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:43.930
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you gotta make a choice which is</v>

617
00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:48.040
<v Speaker 4>you got to choose to be optimistic</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's the only force multiplier</v>

618
00:30:48.041 --> 00:30:50.740
<v Speaker 4>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is you're going to decide that if</v>

619
00:30:50.741 --> 00:30:53.380
<v Speaker 4>something's not right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to call,</v>

620
00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.740
<v Speaker 4>you're going to write letters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to write editorials that</v>

621
00:30:55.741 --> 00:31:00.741
<v Speaker 4>you're to build campaigns around things</v>
<v Speaker 4>because in the end that's the only way</v>

622
00:31:00.791 --> 00:31:04.390
<v Speaker 4>to change things and if all of us felt a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little of that spirit,</v>

623
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.380
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>today,</v>

624
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.970
<v Speaker 4>if not every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that would make</v>

625
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:12.250
<v Speaker 4>extraordinary difference and we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>already seeing its impact in Washington.</v>

626
00:31:12.251 --> 00:31:17.251
<v Speaker 4>There are more people showing up in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>capital city for votes for marches.</v>

627
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:21.580
<v Speaker 4>There are more people reaching out to</v>
<v Speaker 4>their members of Congress than ever</v>

628
00:31:21.581 --> 00:31:25.360
<v Speaker 4>before and I just think we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to sustain that energy if we want</v>

629
00:31:25.361 --> 00:31:28.600
<v Speaker 4>to create some real change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's about more people who have</v>

630
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:32.800
<v Speaker 4>an opinion of values that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>trustworthy in the community running.</v>

631
00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.250
<v Speaker 4>I think more people need to run because</v>
<v Speaker 4>for awhile we've.</v>

632
00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:38.770
<v Speaker 4>I've actually looked at government as</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like I may be,</v>

633
00:31:38.771 --> 00:31:41.590
<v Speaker 4>could never be part of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a totally different thing,</v>

634
00:31:41.591 --> 00:31:42.900
<v Speaker 4>like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

635
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.160
<v Speaker 4>I researched the candidates and I go</v>
<v Speaker 4>vote and that's,</v>

636
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:49.150
<v Speaker 4>that's my interaction with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm starting to realize that even if</v>

637
00:31:49.151 --> 00:31:51.810
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to run or even if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to run it,</v>

638
00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:56.850
<v Speaker 4>it's a possibility and you number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can encourage your other friends to</v>

639
00:31:57.761 --> 00:32:01.180
<v Speaker 4>go run and you can look at who is trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to start campaigns.</v>

640
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.510
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm 35 now and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Dara friends from law school.</v>

641
00:32:04.511 --> 00:32:05.560
<v Speaker 4>Then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

642
00:32:05.561 --> 00:32:07.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking about running,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

643
00:32:07.001 --> 00:32:09.460
<v Speaker 4>like I want to throw a fundraiser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who should I speak to?</v>

644
00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:12.220
<v Speaker 4>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a guy that I played basketball</v>

645
00:32:12.221 --> 00:32:13.390
<v Speaker 4>within a basketball league.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

646
00:32:13.391 --> 00:32:15.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try to run for governor of</v>
<v Speaker 4>California.</v>

647
00:32:15.371 --> 00:32:16.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good luck,</v>

648
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:20.890
<v Speaker 4>but like I'm going to follow what you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing and I think more people need to</v>

649
00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:22.240
<v Speaker 4>run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you're not running,</v>

650
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.700
<v Speaker 4>hold the people that are running</v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible,</v>

651
00:32:24.701 --> 00:32:28.870
<v Speaker 4>ask the difficult questions like be a</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of the kind of vetting of that</v>

652
00:32:28.871 --> 00:32:33.070
<v Speaker 4>candidate and be hands on in the process</v>
<v Speaker 4>of that person's candidacy.</v>

653
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.290
<v Speaker 4>Are you running for president with</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oprah?</v>

654
00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.193
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

655
00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:39.200
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not running mind.</v>

656
00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:40.083
<v Speaker 4>Thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

657
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:42.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we all need to have a stake in</v>

658
00:32:42.921 --> 00:32:46.880
<v Speaker 5>the cats that are running in and ask the</v>
<v Speaker 5>questions that need to be asked because</v>

659
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.620
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been one of the people that just</v>

660
00:32:48.621 --> 00:32:51.380
<v Speaker 5>shows up maybe two weeks before the</v>
<v Speaker 5>election,</v>

661
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.790
<v Speaker 5>two weeks before the deadline of like</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

662
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.860
<v Speaker 5>the absentee ballot and I go research</v>
<v Speaker 5>for two weeks and I go check out all the</v>

663
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.550
<v Speaker 5>pros and cons of each candidate and</v>
<v Speaker 5>after two weeks I decide,</v>

664
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:04.820
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should be involved more than that.</v>

665
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.490
<v Speaker 5>I said as it announce your congressional</v>
<v Speaker 5>run right here.</v>

666
00:33:07.491 --> 00:33:09.770
<v Speaker 5>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm too busy.</v>

667
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm too busy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not the problem though.</v>

668
00:33:12.231 --> 00:33:15.140
<v Speaker 5>The people that we would want to run for</v>
<v Speaker 5>president or whatever,</v>

669
00:33:15.141 --> 00:33:17.210
<v Speaker 5>elected official oftentimes are too</v>
<v Speaker 5>busy.</v>

670
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.950
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if you ran.</v>

671
00:33:18.951 --> 00:33:22.100
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm not really clean up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could really do it.</v>

672
00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:23.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm not running.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got a bigger platform than I do.</v>

673
00:33:23.731 --> 00:33:25.700
<v Speaker 5>I'm interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

674
00:33:25.701 --> 00:33:30.020
<v Speaker 5>I don't see important though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You find a way to participate in public</v>

675
00:33:30.021 --> 00:33:34.760
<v Speaker 5>life and give back whether you run or</v>
<v Speaker 5>support someone or encourage your</v>

676
00:33:34.761 --> 00:33:38.000
<v Speaker 5>friends and they don't have to be the</v>
<v Speaker 5>person who was the student council</v>

677
00:33:38.001 --> 00:33:41.240
<v Speaker 5>president in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Muslim people out there.</v>

678
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.640
<v Speaker 5>My thing with candidates say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>great,</v>

679
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.660
<v Speaker 5>so joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've had disagreements on the show.</v>

680
00:33:44.661 --> 00:33:46.730
<v Speaker 5>We disagree about certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just screwed up.</v>

681
00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:47.840
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a.</v>

682
00:33:47.841 --> 00:33:50.820
<v Speaker 5>It was the minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A university changed my mind based.</v>

683
00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:54.810
<v Speaker 5>By the way I changed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a knee jerk reaction to you.</v>

684
00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.500
<v Speaker 5>We've talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was talking about universal basic</v>

685
00:33:57.501 --> 00:34:01.530
<v Speaker 5>income and net neutrality was sorta</v>
<v Speaker 5>nerdy,</v>

686
00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:04.490
<v Speaker 5>nerdy about ubi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you</v>

687
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.190
<v Speaker 5>automatically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>knee jerk goes,</v>

688
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:09.200
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't do that.</v>

689
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:10.970
<v Speaker 5>It's bad for human nature.</v>

690
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:12.770
<v Speaker 5>You give people money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get lazy,</v>

691
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:13.910
<v Speaker 5>but then I thought about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

692
00:34:13.911 --> 00:34:15.350
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just giving them food and</v>

693
00:34:15.351 --> 00:34:17.840
<v Speaker 5>shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You give people food and shelter.</v>

694
00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:21.410
<v Speaker 5>You're still leaving open ambition and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're also freeing them up for the</v>

695
00:34:21.411 --> 00:34:26.210
<v Speaker 5>possibility of perhaps exploring things</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they would really truly love to do</v>

696
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:28.580
<v Speaker 5>where they have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think when we,</v>

697
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.220
<v Speaker 5>when we started dealing with automated</v>
<v Speaker 5>vehicles,</v>

698
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:35.690
<v Speaker 5>automated trucks and trucking and</v>
<v Speaker 5>shipping and driving is a giant</v>

699
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:38.870
<v Speaker 5>business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a huge part of what people have to</v>

700
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.690
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some extraordinary percentage of</v>

701
00:34:41.691 --> 00:34:46.400
<v Speaker 5>men who drive for a living and if you</v>
<v Speaker 5>eliminate that,</v>

702
00:34:46.401 --> 00:34:47.780
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have a lot of people out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of work.</v>

703
00:34:47.781 --> 00:34:49.670
<v Speaker 5>You have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have automation that's coming to</v>

704
00:34:49.671 --> 00:34:51.140
<v Speaker 5>factories and all these different</v>
<v Speaker 5>places.</v>

705
00:34:51.141 --> 00:34:54.680
<v Speaker 5>It's going to eliminate the need for</v>
<v Speaker 5>humans cut out all the human error or</v>

706
00:34:54.681 --> 00:34:57.410
<v Speaker 5>what are we going to do with all those</v>
<v Speaker 5>people and what are we gonna do with all</v>

707
00:34:57.411 --> 00:35:02.160
<v Speaker 5>those jobs and how do you give these</v>
<v Speaker 5>people this newfound possibility,</v>

708
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:02.810
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

709
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:07.760
<v Speaker 5>this avenue for exploring new potential</v>
<v Speaker 5>career paths.</v>

710
00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:11.630
<v Speaker 5>What will the best way is have their</v>
<v Speaker 5>money taken care of in terms of like</v>

711
00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:14.810
<v Speaker 5>food and shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like have given them the freedom to</v>

712
00:35:14.811 --> 00:35:15.950
<v Speaker 5>explore ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

713
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.910
<v Speaker 5>because it's a benefit a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>have and then they do work and you take</v>

714
00:35:19.911 --> 00:35:23.600
<v Speaker 5>that stress off their plate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I talked about the conversation</v>

715
00:35:23.601 --> 00:35:26.090
<v Speaker 5>because we had it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had a good discussion about it and</v>

716
00:35:26.091 --> 00:35:29.780
<v Speaker 5>then it went on for weeks on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We kept talking and then we both kind of</v>

717
00:35:29.781 --> 00:35:32.090
<v Speaker 5>came around on on things and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yo,</v>

718
00:35:32.091 --> 00:35:34.580
<v Speaker 5>this is great and when I think about</v>
<v Speaker 5>candidates,</v>

719
00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:38.220
<v Speaker 5>I think about I would vote for somebody</v>
<v Speaker 5>who they're</v>

720
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.630
<v Speaker 3>going to stick to their guns and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna do what they said they would and</v>

721
00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:45.060
<v Speaker 3>their values aren't going to change once</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go to DC.</v>

722
00:35:45.061 --> 00:35:46.550
<v Speaker 3>That's all you can ask for from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

723
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:50.130
<v Speaker 3>Be honest about who you are and be who</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are when you go to DC,</v>

724
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.720
<v Speaker 1>future of civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

725
00:35:53.721 --> 00:35:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Like where are we now and where this</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane change that we've experienced</v>

726
00:35:58.191 --> 00:35:59.780
<v Speaker 1>over the last 20 years because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

727
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:01.760
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it going to be like in 20 years</v>

728
00:36:01.761 --> 00:36:05.600
<v Speaker 1>from now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens to the average person,</v>

729
00:36:05.601 --> 00:36:09.080
<v Speaker 1>the average human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have this idea that you're supposed</v>

730
00:36:09.081 --> 00:36:13.020
<v Speaker 1>to show up nine to five for a job and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do and then you work</v>

731
00:36:13.021 --> 00:36:16.310
<v Speaker 1>until you're retired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's all something that people</v>

732
00:36:16.311 --> 00:36:18.170
<v Speaker 1>invented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's all of.</v>

733
00:36:18.171 --> 00:36:20.510
<v Speaker 1>This is a new thing in terms of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

734
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:25.750
<v Speaker 1>This is not the only way human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>can live and the idea that this is the</v>

735
00:36:25.821 --> 00:36:30.821
<v Speaker 1>only way to use our tax money or</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources is the way we're doing it</v>

736
00:36:30.921 --> 00:36:33.620
<v Speaker 1>currently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem to be that logical and</v>

737
00:36:33.621 --> 00:36:38.270
<v Speaker 1>I would like people to have more</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to innovate and create and</v>

738
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:41.180
<v Speaker 1>more freedom where they don't feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>shackled down.</v>

739
00:36:41.181 --> 00:36:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of people out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just feel shackled down by just the</v>

740
00:36:44.451 --> 00:36:47.840
<v Speaker 1>need to feed themselves and survive.</v>

741
00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also just even school,</v>

742
00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.990
<v Speaker 3>like I started reading and listening to</v>
<v Speaker 3>these podcasts about sleep.</v>

743
00:36:52.991 --> 00:36:53.824
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a.</v>

744
00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:57.010
<v Speaker 3>it's a scientific thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people are not morning people.</v>

745
00:36:57.011 --> 00:37:01.480
<v Speaker 3>She's laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like reading or listening to</v>

746
00:37:01.481 --> 00:37:03.520
<v Speaker 3>podcasts about sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will.</v>

747
00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:07.820
<v Speaker 3>You could get information at Somnia</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to pat.</v>

748
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.350
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I listened to this dude and he was</v>

749
00:37:11.351 --> 00:37:13.310
<v Speaker 3>talking about like it's a scientific</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

750
00:37:13.311 --> 00:37:15.460
<v Speaker 3>Some people are on a different body</v>
<v Speaker 3>rhythm,</v>

751
00:37:15.461 --> 00:37:18.790
<v Speaker 3>they just don't do well in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he looked at schools in the school</v>

752
00:37:18.791 --> 00:37:21.670
<v Speaker 3>schedule and the school schedule is</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on mom and dad's.</v>

753
00:37:21.671 --> 00:37:25.150
<v Speaker 3>They have a nine to five based on</v>
<v Speaker 3>traffic and let's try to get these kids</v>

754
00:37:25.151 --> 00:37:26.870
<v Speaker 3>into school for high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The earliest.</v>

755
00:37:26.871 --> 00:37:30.700
<v Speaker 3>Then middle school later than elementary</v>
<v Speaker 3>school after that and some people</v>

756
00:37:30.701 --> 00:37:34.510
<v Speaker 3>because they're morning people did just</v>
<v Speaker 3>suck at such a disadvantage and</v>

757
00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:36.520
<v Speaker 3>highschool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>college.</v>

758
00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.460
<v Speaker 3>This is like kind of an educational</v>
<v Speaker 3>industrial complex.</v>

759
00:37:39.461 --> 00:37:42.340
<v Speaker 3>If you don't fit in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not cookie cutter and the way</v>

760
00:37:42.341 --> 00:37:45.440
<v Speaker 3>your body and your mind works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be successful.</v>

761
00:37:45.441 --> 00:37:50.441
<v Speaker 3>And and speaking of what Joe's talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about is I think I genuinely believe</v>

762
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.200
<v Speaker 3>like even some of the silliest people</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met,</v>

763
00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:58.000
<v Speaker 3>everybody has some sort of genius it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just not like fostering the</v>

764
00:37:58.001 --> 00:38:00.040
<v Speaker 3>unearthing of that and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

765
00:38:00.041 --> 00:38:02.740
<v Speaker 3>there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some hilarious stuff that</v>

766
00:38:02.741 --> 00:38:06.460
<v Speaker 3>happens at Bauhaus at the restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I tell myself every time I'm like,</v>

767
00:38:06.461 --> 00:38:08.830
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this guy totally messed up making</v>

768
00:38:08.831 --> 00:38:10.840
<v Speaker 3>this bow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy totally messed up.</v>

769
00:38:10.841 --> 00:38:14.230
<v Speaker 3>Butchering this chicken blake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find a place where he can succeed,</v>

770
00:38:14.231 --> 00:38:17.470
<v Speaker 3>like put him in a position to win and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot of responsibility.</v>

771
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't always work out,</v>

772
00:38:20.351 --> 00:38:22.060
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But usually it does.</v>

773
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:23.860
<v Speaker 3>Usually you find out like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

774
00:38:23.861 --> 00:38:25.660
<v Speaker 3>That guy's really good at making the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sauce,</v>

775
00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:26.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like put them on the sauce.</v>

776
00:38:26.891 --> 00:38:29.740
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to find a place where</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to be successful,</v>

777
00:38:29.741 --> 00:38:33.010
<v Speaker 3>but our society have to find their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>funding.</v>

778
00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is if you do have a nine to</v>

779
00:38:35.891 --> 00:38:38.680
<v Speaker 1>five job and you're trying to feed</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and get along,</v>

780
00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:41.440
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have less chances to</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovate.</v>

781
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:45.620
<v Speaker 1>You're going to left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left chances to take risky decisions and</v>

782
00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.870
<v Speaker 1>just try things out.</v>

783
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:50.170
<v Speaker 2>That is why Internet openness is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>important though,</v>

784
00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.910
<v Speaker 2>because this was a platform and a space</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you to go experiment,</v>

785
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.730
<v Speaker 2>build community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find communities,</v>

786
00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.460
<v Speaker 2>figure out what your genius might</v>
<v Speaker 2>involve,</v>

787
00:39:00.461 --> 00:39:02.620
<v Speaker 2>which may not be what you're doing at</v>
<v Speaker 2>work every day.</v>

788
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:09.060
<v Speaker 2>And I think the idea that Washington is</v>
<v Speaker 2>mucking around with that is just crazy.</v>

789
00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely don't think they liked the</v>

790
00:39:11.981 --> 00:39:15.490
<v Speaker 2>fact that people have this ability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely think if you could,</v>

791
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.060
<v Speaker 2>if the people who created the Internet</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew what they were doing when they</v>

792
00:39:19.061 --> 00:39:22.990
<v Speaker 2>release this on the general public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably wouldn't have liked to</v>

793
00:39:22.991 --> 00:39:26.710
<v Speaker 2>give people the kind of access to</v>
<v Speaker 2>information and the ability to change</v>

794
00:39:26.711 --> 00:39:28.960
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we've seen through Arab spring,</v>

795
00:39:28.961 --> 00:39:33.730
<v Speaker 2>we've seen through so many different</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures that are using this to change</v>

796
00:39:33.731 --> 00:39:35.810
<v Speaker 2>the way they interact with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

797
00:39:35.811 --> 00:39:38.380
<v Speaker 2>it was interesting during our net</v>
<v Speaker 2>neutrality proceeding,</v>

798
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:41.490
<v Speaker 2>Tim Berners Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who um,</v>

799
00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>invented the web and vint cerf who</v>

800
00:39:44.861 --> 00:39:49.750
<v Speaker 2>invented the Internet along with some</v>
<v Speaker 2>real icons from early days like Mitchell</v>

801
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Baker from Mozilla all wrote us and</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

802
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:57.340
<v Speaker 2>do not change these rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems like when you've got that</v>

803
00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:01.600
<v Speaker 2>incredible genius of these people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>created this connected world for you and</v>

804
00:40:01.601 --> 00:40:05.260
<v Speaker 2>told you that this agency in Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to really mess around with</v>

805
00:40:05.261 --> 00:40:06.880
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It strikes me that,</v>

806
00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:08.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should have listened.</v>

807
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we definitely should have listened,</v>

808
00:40:09.411 --> 00:40:12.710
<v Speaker 1>but we also shouldn't have this place</v>
<v Speaker 1>where five people get to make this</v>

809
00:40:12.711 --> 00:40:14.390
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

810
00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:15.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going in what you just said,</v>

811
00:40:15.981 --> 00:40:17.780
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like even even like,</v>

812
00:40:17.781 --> 00:40:18.940
<v Speaker 3>let's say my role at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

813
00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:22.760
<v Speaker 3>just to explain it from my role as the</v>
<v Speaker 3>owner or manager at the restaurant is</v>

814
00:40:22.761 --> 00:40:27.650
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily always my job to create</v>
<v Speaker 3>a role for somebody in find a way for</v>

815
00:40:27.651 --> 00:40:30.110
<v Speaker 3>them to be successful in my restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hiring a cook,</v>

816
00:40:30.111 --> 00:40:32.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm hiring a manager.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is the job description.</v>

817
00:40:32.781 --> 00:40:34.940
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully if you're coming for this job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do this.</v>

818
00:40:34.941 --> 00:40:38.650
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think what you said really opened</v>

819
00:40:38.651 --> 00:40:41.810
<v Speaker 3>some in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the government should not be</v>

820
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.510
<v Speaker 3>always prescriptive about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

821
00:40:44.511 --> 00:40:47.240
<v Speaker 3>we're all going to go to school at 7:00.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to study hard and you're</v>

822
00:40:47.241 --> 00:40:48.980
<v Speaker 3>going to get these grades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to go to college,</v>

823
00:40:48.981 --> 00:40:51.500
<v Speaker 3>like that's not a path to success for</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>

824
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:56.710
<v Speaker 3>but what it should do is enable people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be creative and find out what works</v>

825
00:40:56.991 --> 00:40:59.600
<v Speaker 3>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to give people the freedom to</v>

826
00:40:59.601 --> 00:41:00.920
<v Speaker 3>contribute to society.</v>

827
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:02.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're trying to manage the</v>

828
00:41:02.901 --> 00:41:07.850
<v Speaker 1>masses without looking at the needs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas of the individual and</v>

829
00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:12.940
<v Speaker 1>everybody has their own likes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dislikes and creative kinks and things</v>

830
00:41:13.761 --> 00:41:18.761
<v Speaker 1>that mean how many people could have</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived a life of misery but got lucky</v>

831
00:41:20.871 --> 00:41:24.410
<v Speaker 1>somewhere along the line and found</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that they love and,</v>

832
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:29.030
<v Speaker 1>and pursued that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that there's not a whole lot</v>

833
00:41:29.031 --> 00:41:34.031
<v Speaker 1>of guidance in that regard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what there is on the Internet is</v>

834
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:39.110
<v Speaker 1>examples of other people have done this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can connect with those people</v>

835
00:41:39.111 --> 00:41:41.330
<v Speaker 1>and you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many communities when it</v>

836
00:41:41.331 --> 00:41:43.630
<v Speaker 1>comes to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean to.</v>

837
00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:44.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm don't.</v>

838
00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:46.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm weird about stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

839
00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:50.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked knifemaking make knives.</v>

840
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:51.980
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of ominous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

841
00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:52.621
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

842
00:41:52.621 --> 00:41:53.440
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

843
00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:57.500
<v Speaker 1>The craft of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the idea of forging things.</v>

844
00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I just think I find that fascinating and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I follow like dozens of these guys on</v>

845
00:42:05.301 --> 00:42:10.301
<v Speaker 1>instagram that make knives and hatchets</v>
<v Speaker 1>and metal work and tools and furniture</v>

846
00:42:10.971 --> 00:42:12.770
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making furniture.</v>

847
00:42:12.771 --> 00:42:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I have no desire to make furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even thinking about it,</v>

848
00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.640
<v Speaker 1>but I like watching this and I like</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching these people communicate with</v>

849
00:42:19.641 --> 00:42:24.410
<v Speaker 1>each other and explain the methods and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the techniques they use and this is a,</v>

850
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an avenue where a young kid could see</v>

851
00:42:27.561 --> 00:42:29.990
<v Speaker 1>something like that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make furniture.</v>

852
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Like that seems like a cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like look at this amazing</v>

853
00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:35.500
<v Speaker 2>that is too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you were growing up,</v>

854
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:38.530
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to go to some library and</v>

855
00:42:38.531 --> 00:42:42.010
<v Speaker 2>go to that close to it and look things</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

856
00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:47.250
<v Speaker 2>You would never see the video content</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the number of people doing that at</v>

857
00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.580
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so casually and quickly legitimizes</v>

858
00:42:51.581 --> 00:42:54.340
<v Speaker 2>it for you as something to think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>two or pursue.</v>

859
00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.720
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

860
00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had A.</v>

861
00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:01.790
<v Speaker 1>I had a knife made out of meteor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of media.</v>

862
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:04.840
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How hard is media steel?</v>

863
00:43:04.841 --> 00:43:05.810
<v Speaker 1>It's metal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's iron.</v>

864
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make it with the iron that came out</v>

865
00:43:08.871 --> 00:43:11.480
<v Speaker 1>of a media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mousy fire arts made it for me.</v>

866
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.630
<v Speaker 1>How did you cop media?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've contacted them.</v>

867
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.670
<v Speaker 1>I contacted him and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

868
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:20.120
<v Speaker 1>well I knew there's a guy named Steve</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kramer that makes somebody made one for</v>

869
00:43:20.121 --> 00:43:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Bourdain and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want what he got out.</v>

870
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.720
<v Speaker 1>One of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a fucking meteor knife.</v>

871
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:29.450
<v Speaker 1>How do I get to meet your knife?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my kitchen knife is made from a</v>

872
00:43:29.451 --> 00:43:30.560
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

873
00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatras and was made by that time.</v>

874
00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Got a step by my knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Game up because I just,</v>

875
00:43:38.481 --> 00:43:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I still just use the cleaver man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so like ancient Chinese with my</v>

876
00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.300
<v Speaker 1>chopping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to cleaver.</v>

877
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not the wrong with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleveland.</v>

878
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.020
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just looks cool because I know it</v>

879
00:43:48.021 --> 00:43:49.280
<v Speaker 1>came from bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

880
00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:49.791
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

881
00:43:49.791 --> 00:43:51.340
<v Speaker 1>I could expand the arsenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam,</v>

882
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:55.040
<v Speaker 1>media chef's knife to tell everyone that</v>
<v Speaker 1>came from a meteor when they come into</v>

883
00:43:55.041 --> 00:43:56.690
<v Speaker 1>your kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just sort of impressive.</v>

884
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:58.970
<v Speaker 1>He showed it to a couple of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got it recently,</v>

885
00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

886
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I think that this new world of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

887
00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:09.830
<v Speaker 1>of the Internet in terms of like is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to explore these communities and</v>

888
00:44:09.831 --> 00:44:11.060
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

889
00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:14.210
<v Speaker 1>like see the video of someone like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>clock,</v>

890
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:16.880
<v Speaker 1>this a russell bill made this clock for</v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

891
00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:18.920
<v Speaker 1>that the grandfather clock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

892
00:44:18.921 --> 00:44:22.670
<v Speaker 1>that dude made that all of the metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He welded it all,</v>

893
00:44:22.671 --> 00:44:24.410
<v Speaker 1>put it all together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

894
00:44:24.411 --> 00:44:28.970
<v Speaker 1>this kind of stuff to me is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating and I don't just like it</v>

895
00:44:28.971 --> 00:44:31.040
<v Speaker 1>because I'm interested in the craft of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all.</v>

896
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:35.070
<v Speaker 1>I like it because I see it as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for people to get out of the</v>

897
00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:38.430
<v Speaker 1>grind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can make things if you can make</v>

898
00:44:38.431 --> 00:44:42.000
<v Speaker 1>things and sell things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have an Internet connection and</v>

899
00:44:42.001 --> 00:44:45.360
<v Speaker 1>you have an instagram account which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>free and you have an iphone,</v>

900
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:47.220
<v Speaker 1>you take your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you film something,</v>

901
00:44:47.221 --> 00:44:47.800
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

902
00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.480
<v Speaker 4>next thing you know you're selling</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

903
00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:50.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

904
00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:54.550
<v Speaker 4>it's an incredible time for like</v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to escape.</v>

905
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:57.650
<v Speaker 4>The biggest lie people fall for is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

906
00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.190
<v Speaker 4>they're bad at something or they're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>valuable.</v>

907
00:45:00.191 --> 00:45:04.120
<v Speaker 4>It's like you may be bad in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>structural definition of a human being</v>

908
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:06.580
<v Speaker 4>that goes to school and gets a nine to</v>
<v Speaker 4>five job.</v>

909
00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:08.860
<v Speaker 4>I was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was terrible at it.</v>

910
00:45:08.861 --> 00:45:10.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got fired from a Boston market.</v>

911
00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:14.140
<v Speaker 4>I got fired from the waterworks like I</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't work anywhere.</v>

912
00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.590
<v Speaker 4>I got fired as a landscaper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People's lawns.</v>

913
00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:20.500
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then it's like when you become in</v>

914
00:45:20.501 --> 00:45:23.740
<v Speaker 4>control of your own shit and you go do</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're passionate about,</v>

915
00:45:23.741 --> 00:45:26.560
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then I became successful and I try</v>

916
00:45:26.561 --> 00:45:27.930
<v Speaker 4>to tell people all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

917
00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.020
<v Speaker 4>if this doesn't work for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the straight and narrow,</v>

918
00:45:30.021 --> 00:45:30.910
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't work for you.</v>

919
00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:35.920
<v Speaker 4>Like think of a way to think about what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think your strengths are and play to</v>

920
00:45:35.921 --> 00:45:37.960
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't let anyone tell you you're a</v>

921
00:45:37.961 --> 00:45:39.580
<v Speaker 4>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're unsuccessful because you don't</v>

922
00:45:39.581 --> 00:45:41.560
<v Speaker 4>fit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The stereotype I think is really</v>

923
00:45:41.561 --> 00:45:45.070
<v Speaker 4>important though for successful people</v>
<v Speaker 4>like yourself to tell their failure</v>

924
00:45:45.071 --> 00:45:47.590
<v Speaker 4>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't do that enough.</v>

925
00:45:47.591 --> 00:45:49.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I lost a restaurant because I</v>

926
00:45:49.091 --> 00:45:51.250
<v Speaker 4>sold all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can drink four Loko like that was</v>

927
00:45:51.251 --> 00:45:55.210
<v Speaker 4>like I went out in flames.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can drink for local sounds like a</v>

928
00:45:55.211 --> 00:45:58.240
<v Speaker 4>liability when you're good at telling</v>
<v Speaker 4>stories,</v>

929
00:45:58.241 --> 00:46:00.100
<v Speaker 4>but I think that that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Generally,</v>

930
00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.930
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I wish I could ask every</v>
<v Speaker 4>member of Congress to tell a failure</v>

931
00:46:04.931 --> 00:46:06.160
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would never do that.</v>

932
00:46:06.161 --> 00:46:08.200
<v Speaker 4>Those people are trying to pretend</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're something different.</v>

933
00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:11.990
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a terrible law student.</v>

934
00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:18.240
<v Speaker 4>Anything more explosive like before you</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever sell for local at a lemonade stand?</v>

935
00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:23.200
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you I absolutely never did</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and probably never will.</v>

936
00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.830
<v Speaker 4>Any other failures?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

937
00:46:26.831 --> 00:46:28.360
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got some parenting failures that I'm</v>

938
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:30.520
<v Speaker 4>going to save my children from</v>
<v Speaker 4>announcing in public</v>

939
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:32.500
<v Speaker 1>call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good call.</v>

940
00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's important for people to</v>

941
00:46:36.191 --> 00:46:37.450
<v Speaker 1>relate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

942
00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.100
<v Speaker 1>They have to be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

943
00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Eddie wasn't always a successful guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was a 19 year old kid wants to.</v>

944
00:46:44.351 --> 00:46:47.350
<v Speaker 1>That was also struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very important.</v>

945
00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:48.520
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

946
00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:52.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that people can understand that</v>

947
00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:58.070
<v Speaker 1>failure is an opportunity to learn and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that horrible feeling of failure is</v>

948
00:46:58.331 --> 00:47:01.240
<v Speaker 1>really your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that horrible feeling motivates you</v>

949
00:47:01.241 --> 00:47:02.010
<v Speaker 1>to change?</v>

950
00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean I feel all the time I played</v>
<v Speaker 4>basketball yesterday.</v>

951
00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.580
<v Speaker 4>We had a double header.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

952
00:47:05.581 --> 00:47:09.510
<v Speaker 4>I was cooking on a grill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was making lamb skewers for four hours</v>

953
00:47:09.511 --> 00:47:14.010
<v Speaker 4>in the morning when straight from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>kitchen to this basketball game and San</v>

954
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:16.200
<v Speaker 4>Gabriel valley playing with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like an Asian basketball league.</v>

955
00:47:16.201 --> 00:47:18.160
<v Speaker 4>So I'm actually like kind of toll like</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

956
00:47:18.161 --> 00:47:22.710
<v Speaker 4>like a small forward and there's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>little younger dudes at 25 running</v>

957
00:47:22.711 --> 00:47:25.080
<v Speaker 4>around me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did not have played well the first</v>

958
00:47:25.081 --> 00:47:28.920
<v Speaker 4>game I was washed the second game and</v>
<v Speaker 4>these kids probably like 23,</v>

959
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 4>four years</v>

960
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.400
<v Speaker 3>old running past me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elbowing me and I got so mad and I act</v>

961
00:47:34.401 --> 00:47:36.220
<v Speaker 3>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started like yelling at them.</v>

962
00:47:36.221 --> 00:47:41.221
<v Speaker 3>I started like beefing and I got home</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I told my fiance about it and she's</v>

963
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:41.891
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

964
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:44.890
<v Speaker 3>why are you beefing with these kids?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're 25,</v>

965
00:47:44.891 --> 00:47:46.060
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your old.</v>

966
00:47:46.061 --> 00:47:48.880
<v Speaker 3>Of course they're gonna run by you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you playing a double header and you came</v>

967
00:47:48.881 --> 00:47:52.510
<v Speaker 3>out of the kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was funny because I was like not</v>

968
00:47:52.511 --> 00:47:54.850
<v Speaker 3>willing to let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I was like,</v>

969
00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.070
<v Speaker 3>I got to work on myself like every</v>
<v Speaker 3>single day,</v>

970
00:47:57.071 --> 00:48:01.120
<v Speaker 3>like I fail at something and I failed at</v>
<v Speaker 3>being like the elder statesmen in the</v>

971
00:48:01.121 --> 00:48:02.620
<v Speaker 3>basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're being composed,</v>

972
00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:04.810
<v Speaker 3>being composed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lost my composure and I started making</v>

973
00:48:04.811 --> 00:48:06.670
<v Speaker 3>fun of these kids for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

974
00:48:06.671 --> 00:48:08.350
<v Speaker 3>that's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

975
00:48:08.351 --> 00:48:10.540
<v Speaker 3>like basketball sometimes brings out the</v>
<v Speaker 3>worst in me,</v>

976
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.370
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

977
00:48:12.371 --> 00:48:14.680
<v Speaker 3>today I'm going to be a better person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll go back to that week,</v>

978
00:48:14.681 --> 00:48:18.520
<v Speaker 3>next week I'm gonna be like a nice dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if some kid washes me in west me in</v>

979
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:19.570
<v Speaker 3>the face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets fine.</v>

980
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:20.110
<v Speaker 3>Well</v>

981
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Times you just need to experience it so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

982
00:48:22.481 --> 00:48:24.400
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have to be more composed when</v>

983
00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:27.340
<v Speaker 1>that comes up and when you didn't expect</v>
<v Speaker 1>to experience it.</v>

984
00:48:27.341 --> 00:48:28.720
<v Speaker 1>And then someone hits you with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>elbow,</v>

985
00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:29.890
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

986
00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next thing you know,</v>

987
00:48:31.871 --> 00:48:32.704
<v Speaker 1>it's intense</v>

988
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:33.940
<v Speaker 3>boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball,</v>

989
00:48:33.941 --> 00:48:36.260
<v Speaker 3>it's the most like sports system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most humbling thing for me.</v>

990
00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm not built for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of built to fail at sport,</v>

991
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:44.800
<v Speaker 3>but you try anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try because I try because it's the</v>

992
00:48:44.801 --> 00:48:45.970
<v Speaker 3>thing I'm the worst at,</v>

993
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:47.550
<v Speaker 1>so I always wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

994
00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:51.000
<v Speaker 1>it's great for the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about sports is you're forcing</v>

995
00:48:51.001 --> 00:48:54.840
<v Speaker 1>your body to do things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable and in doing that you're</v>

996
00:48:54.841 --> 00:48:58.230
<v Speaker 1>not just exercising your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're also exercising your mind and</v>

997
00:48:58.231 --> 00:49:01.590
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that I always</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to relate to people that are</v>

998
00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:05.430
<v Speaker 1>negative about physical exercise and</v>
<v Speaker 1>exertion because they think that it's</v>

999
00:49:05.431 --> 00:49:09.080
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a frivolous venture that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just vanity.</v>

1000
00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Just want to look good or use your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a mental aspect to having</v>

1001
00:49:14.791 --> 00:49:19.710
<v Speaker 1>the ability to push through discomfort</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is extremely valuable and if you</v>

1002
00:49:19.711 --> 00:49:23.280
<v Speaker 1>don't have that switch where you can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable being uncomfortable because</v>

1003
00:49:23.281 --> 00:49:24.960
<v Speaker 1>you've done it a million times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>

1004
00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:27.450
<v Speaker 1>then you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna be panicky.</v>

1005
00:49:27.451 --> 00:49:30.960
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be weirded out by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is a mental weakness.</v>

1006
00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:35.640
<v Speaker 1>So in that ability to push through</v>
<v Speaker 1>discomfort helps you not just in</v>

1007
00:49:35.641 --> 00:49:39.180
<v Speaker 1>physical exercise and exertion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also helps you in work.</v>

1008
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you have to push through</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain work things instead of getting</v>

1009
00:49:42.991 --> 00:49:45.960
<v Speaker 1>up and getting another cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out what the fuck you're doing,</v>

1010
00:49:45.961 --> 00:49:47.940
<v Speaker 1>figure out what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's this problem you're working on?</v>

1011
00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Concentrate like focus you get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get after it.</v>

1012
00:49:51.481 --> 00:49:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Be comfortable being uncomfortable.</v>

1013
00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in trickle down</v>
<v Speaker 3>economics,</v>

1014
00:49:55.411 --> 00:49:57.720
<v Speaker 3>but I believe in trickle down mental</v>
<v Speaker 3>strength,</v>

1015
00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:01.050
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I start in the gym every morning and</v>

1016
00:50:01.051 --> 00:50:03.750
<v Speaker 3>like whatever happens in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it humbles me.</v>

1017
00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:05.150
<v Speaker 3>It gives me like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1018
00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:08.640
<v Speaker 3>some kind of like energy and I bring</v>
<v Speaker 3>that throughout the day.</v>

1019
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Like what got you hooked in Jujitsu?</v>

1020
00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done martial arts since I was a</v>

1021
00:50:12.541 --> 00:50:15.330
<v Speaker 1>little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's something that is</v>

1022
00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:19.680
<v Speaker 1>inescapable in my life at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is that there is no disconnect</v>

1023
00:50:19.681 --> 00:50:20.760
<v Speaker 1>between the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body,</v>

1024
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:25.620
<v Speaker 1>that they're all one thing and that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can work them individually but not</v>

1025
00:50:25.621 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 1>really because when you working your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

1026
00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:31.790
<v Speaker 1>you need the mind to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The intensity of my workouts is one of</v>

1027
00:50:31.791 --> 00:50:35.420
<v Speaker 1>the most important aspects of it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fuel 100 percent by my mind.</v>

1028
00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:36.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not by my body</v>

1029
00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:40.300
<v Speaker 4>and Plato said that since fifth century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he always wrote about like how training</v>

1030
00:50:40.301 --> 00:50:42.090
<v Speaker 4>the body is just as important as</v>
<v Speaker 4>training</v>

1031
00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.180
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just,</v>

1032
00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:50.340
<v Speaker 1>it's everything because your high level</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem solving with bad physical</v>

1033
00:50:50.341 --> 00:50:51.260
<v Speaker 1>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1034
00:50:51.261 --> 00:50:56.261
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to avoid injury and</v>
<v Speaker 1>humiliation and all these various things</v>

1035
00:50:57.601 --> 00:51:02.070
<v Speaker 1>that are a part of martial arts and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meantime you're trying to maintain</v>

1036
00:51:02.071 --> 00:51:07.071
<v Speaker 1>composure under pressure and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>tired and you have to understand the</v>

1037
00:51:07.411 --> 00:51:11.130
<v Speaker 1>ability to push and push through</v>
<v Speaker 1>discomfort and push through exhaustion,</v>

1038
00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:14.130
<v Speaker 1>but it also fuels the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very important.</v>

1039
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fighting that three round fight.</v>

1040
00:51:16.411 --> 00:51:19.440
<v Speaker 4>I was like my first three round fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got so scared.</v>

1041
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:21.900
<v Speaker 4>I was shaking the whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just told myself,</v>

1042
00:51:21.901 --> 00:51:24.390
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no backing out in the ring.</v>

1043
00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.820
<v Speaker 4>You have to go forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep going forward.</v>

1044
00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:29.760
<v Speaker 4>And like just out of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a pressure fighter.</v>

1045
00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:33.270
<v Speaker 4>Do you mean like just out of fear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I have to be a pressure fighter</v>

1046
00:51:33.271 --> 00:51:37.920
<v Speaker 4>because I don't think in my first fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew I did not have like the in me to</v>

1047
00:51:37.921 --> 00:51:40.430
<v Speaker 4>counter or or do what like the game plan</v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

1048
00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:42.170
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just have to pressure like I have</v>

1049
00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.310
<v Speaker 4>these hands and move these feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then I got through.</v>

1050
00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.250
<v Speaker 4>I got lumped up a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won the fight,</v>

1051
00:51:47.251 --> 00:51:48.300
<v Speaker 4>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

1052
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:52.050
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I could do anything now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so now I keep sparring and I keep</v>

1053
00:51:52.051 --> 00:51:55.980
<v Speaker 4>fighting because I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I can be composed in the ring with</v>

1054
00:51:55.981 --> 00:51:57.990
<v Speaker 4>someone trying to kill me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then like I,</v>

1055
00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:02.270
<v Speaker 4>I can be composed on a podcast or in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>meeting or negotiation.</v>

1056
00:52:02.271 --> 00:52:03.360
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the best.</v>

1057
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:04.463
<v Speaker 4>Martial arts</v>

1058
00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:06.960
<v Speaker 1>is a vehicle for developing your human</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

1059
00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Then that those things are all connected</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a,</v>

1060
00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:14.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a critical lesson for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for young people and if you can push</v>

1061
00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:17.760
<v Speaker 1>through hard workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could push through whatever career</v>

1062
00:52:17.761 --> 00:52:19.030
<v Speaker 1>path you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying</v>

1063
00:52:19.450 --> 00:52:24.380
<v Speaker 4>breaches me respect too because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you can get bodied anytime you can</v>

1064
00:52:24.381 --> 00:52:28.850
<v Speaker 4>get dropped at any time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like be grateful for when you have both</v>

1065
00:52:28.851 --> 00:52:31.580
<v Speaker 4>arms and legs and you're standing on</v>
<v Speaker 4>your two feet because you could be</v>

1066
00:52:31.581 --> 00:52:33.740
<v Speaker 4>dropped at any second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1067
00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:34.540
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

1068
00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:36.200
<v Speaker 4>do you do physical activities?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sports?</v>

1069
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:38.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know she'd been waiting to jump in</v>

1070
00:52:38.631 --> 00:52:39.950
<v Speaker 4>this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1071
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:42.890
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in new England in cold</v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

1072
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:44.840
<v Speaker 4>Where?</v>
<v Speaker 4>In Connecticut?</v>

1073
00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:47.630
<v Speaker 4>Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Outside of Hartford.</v>

1074
00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:49.310
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're one of those people,</v>

1075
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.110
<v Speaker 4>is that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a westport and I think my</v>

1076
00:52:51.111 --> 00:52:54.050
<v Speaker 4>girls from the westport in New York</v>
<v Speaker 4>City.</v>

1077
00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:54.651
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1078
00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:55.640
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She from West Florida.</v>

1079
00:52:55.670 --> 00:53:00.670
<v Speaker 4>So I grew up skiing all the time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still love skiing.</v>

1080
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:06.410
<v Speaker 4>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need the thrill of flying off of</v>

1081
00:53:06.411 --> 00:53:10.310
<v Speaker 4>something that makes me uncomfortable in</v>
<v Speaker 4>order to relax in a perverse way.</v>

1082
00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.380
<v Speaker 4>So when I have vacations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I do.</v>

1083
00:53:12.381 --> 00:53:16.340
<v Speaker 4>I take my kids who right now live in DC</v>
<v Speaker 4>with me and it's pretty flat there.</v>

1084
00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:19.670
<v Speaker 4>So you got to go take them to see some</v>
<v Speaker 4>mountains and you got to go make sure</v>

1085
00:53:19.671 --> 00:53:24.230
<v Speaker 4>that they go down something that's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit too steep every single time</v>

1086
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 4>because I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You build some</v>

1087
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:29.460
<v Speaker 5>resilience when you get down something</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that and you turn around and say,</v>

1088
00:53:29.461 --> 00:53:32.070
<v Speaker 5>well I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can do some other things.</v>

1089
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:36.150
<v Speaker 5>I think there's some resilience in</v>
<v Speaker 5>living in Connecticut too</v>

1090
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:41.970
<v Speaker 5>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 5>weird and plus it's not really a state.</v>

1091
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:46.350
<v Speaker 5>Connecticut's like a highway between New</v>
<v Speaker 5>York and Boston now I would.</v>

1092
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.380
<v Speaker 5>Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Connecticut,</v>

1093
00:53:49.381 --> 00:53:52.920
<v Speaker 5>Rhode Island,</v>
<v Speaker 5>California.</v>

1094
00:53:52.921 --> 00:53:55.450
<v Speaker 5>People if you're not crossing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1095
00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:57.860
<v Speaker 5>I married someone and grew up in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boston,</v>

1096
00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:03.750
<v Speaker 5>Boston</v>
<v Speaker 5>have ideas.</v>

1097
00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:06.270
<v Speaker 5>I never would have thought you were from</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boston where I was born in New Jersey,</v>

1098
00:54:06.271 --> 00:54:09.240
<v Speaker 5>but I grew up in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 5>got rid of it,</v>

1099
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.340
<v Speaker 5>hurt myself on tv when I was 19 and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

1100
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:12.940
<v Speaker 5>fuck that accent.</v>

1101
00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:19.110
<v Speaker 5>So embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Listen to my own accent.</v>

1102
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:23.490
<v Speaker 5>Go home and I hear people with New</v>
<v Speaker 5>England accent and it feels like sweet</v>

1103
00:54:23.491 --> 00:54:26.850
<v Speaker 5>and comforting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's great putting drunk there was</v>

1104
00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:28.110
<v Speaker 5>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like it's normal.</v>

1105
00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:29.940
<v Speaker 5>Can you do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you do a little bit of one right</v>

1106
00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.810
<v Speaker 5>now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1107
00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:34.430
<v Speaker 5>I could see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought you like listening to the</v>

1108
00:54:34.431 --> 00:54:36.090
<v Speaker 5>Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought you were from the south for a</v>

1109
00:54:36.091 --> 00:54:37.980
<v Speaker 5>second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1110
00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:40.620
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you don't have a new England</v>

1111
00:54:40.621 --> 00:54:41.370
<v Speaker 5>accent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1112
00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:42.450
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1113
00:54:42.451 --> 00:54:44.400
<v Speaker 5>but I've been living in Washington for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>little while.</v>

1114
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:47.490
<v Speaker 5>Plus she's a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to get rid of the shit.</v>

1115
00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:51.630
<v Speaker 5>You have the ill politician like the</v>
<v Speaker 5>meter talking.</v>

1116
00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:58.410
<v Speaker 5>It's on like a metronome smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's good.</v>

1117
00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.810
<v Speaker 5>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a good thing.</v>

1118
00:55:00.811 --> 00:55:02.340
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever do this thing with your</v>

1119
00:55:02.341 --> 00:55:04.170
<v Speaker 5>hands?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Clinton used to do the thing where</v>

1120
00:55:04.171 --> 00:55:07.770
<v Speaker 5>you hold your phone like that do this</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing what we need to do in this</v>

1121
00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:09.660
<v Speaker 5>country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never understood that.</v>

1122
00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:12.960
<v Speaker 5>People would always tell me when I do</v>
<v Speaker 5>voiceover,</v>

1123
00:55:12.961 --> 00:55:15.140
<v Speaker 5>like slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>slow down and like I can't slow down.</v>

1124
00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.310
<v Speaker 5>My voice totally changes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I slow down,</v>

1125
00:55:17.311 --> 00:55:19.230
<v Speaker 5>I just got to come,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like shot out of the case.</v>

1126
00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:21.930
<v Speaker 5>True.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you go back to Washington,</v>

1127
00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:24.480
<v Speaker 5>you decide with your congressional</v>
<v Speaker 5>campaign,</v>

1128
00:55:24.481 --> 00:55:27.270
<v Speaker 5>it's all going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are going to slow down when you</v>

1129
00:55:27.271 --> 00:55:28.360
<v Speaker 5>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:30.540
<v Speaker 5>Like you can hear your periods and</v>
<v Speaker 5>commas.</v>

1131
00:55:30.541 --> 00:55:34.110
<v Speaker 5>I just run through sentences with trump</v>
<v Speaker 5>as president.</v>

1132
00:55:34.111 --> 00:55:36.210
<v Speaker 5>I think all bets are off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you do whatever you want.</v>

1133
00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:40.430
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's any rules can call</v>

1134
00:55:40.431 --> 00:55:41.990
<v Speaker 5>into other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shitholes.</v>

1135
00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:43.450
<v Speaker 5>You can get crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I really think you should run.</v>

1137
00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:48.450
<v Speaker 5>You can bring mad people together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that mean?</v>

1138
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:53.540
<v Speaker 5>I'd use you bring people together and</v>
<v Speaker 5>also like I think number one.</v>

<v Speaker 5>from a different perspective.</v>

1148
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1149
00:56:19.711 --> 00:56:22.620
<v Speaker 5>it's a good thing dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you appeal to you appeal to like</v>

1150
00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 5>all people but like,</v>

1151
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:26.290
<v Speaker 4>like I meet a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they run up on me like,</v>

1152
00:56:26.291 --> 00:56:27.400
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on Jerry.</v>

1153
00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.900
<v Speaker 4>You're pretty left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a little,</v>

1154
00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:31.270
<v Speaker 4>you're a little crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I enjoyed talking to you and I'm</v>

1155
00:56:31.271 --> 00:56:31.630
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>

1156
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:32.660
<v Speaker 4>thank you man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

1157
00:56:32.661 --> 00:56:36.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean I come on the show so I can speak</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a different audience than just like,</v>

1158
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:37.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hip hop,</v>

1159
00:56:37.931 --> 00:56:42.931
<v Speaker 4>Asian dudes in my dms</v>
<v Speaker 4>dudes that like Migos and soy sauce,</v>

1160
00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:47.230
<v Speaker 4>like</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that big</v>

1161
00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:50.560
<v Speaker 4>niche.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a weird thing about the</v>

1162
00:56:50.561 --> 00:56:52.390
<v Speaker 4>listeners of this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they don't,</v>

1163
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:54.160
<v Speaker 4>they're not left or right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1164
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:57.100
<v Speaker 4>it was like a weird mixture of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's good.</v>

1165
00:56:57.101 --> 00:57:01.120
<v Speaker 4>That's so much more of that country</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

1166
00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:02.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not gonna,</v>

1167
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:05.650
<v Speaker 4>we're not gonna do things if we don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>start listening to each other.</v>

1168
00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:08.890
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't usually identify as left</v>
<v Speaker 4>his people call me that.</v>

1169
00:57:08.891 --> 00:57:12.420
<v Speaker 4>But it's like your content on the show</v>
<v Speaker 4>galvanizes cats from like all around</v>

1170
00:57:12.421 --> 00:57:12.540
<v Speaker 4>around the</v>

1171
00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:13.620
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1172
00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't identify as left either,</v>

1173
00:57:16.561 --> 00:57:20.940
<v Speaker 1>but I do when it comes to so many issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to gay rights,</v>

1174
00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:25.140
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to civil rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to just across the board</v>

1175
00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:27.630
<v Speaker 1>things that you would automatically</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider liberal,</v>

1176
00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:32.040
<v Speaker 1>but also the freedom to express</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1177
00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to me is the marketplace of free</v>

1178
00:57:36.241 --> 00:57:40.260
<v Speaker 1>ideas is one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of developing a civilization.</v>

1179
00:57:40.261 --> 00:57:44.460
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most important ways that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we understand about each other and you</v>

1180
00:57:44.461 --> 00:57:47.910
<v Speaker 1>got to have an open mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I was saying like you bring up</v>

1181
00:57:47.911 --> 00:57:49.950
<v Speaker 1>that universal basic income and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1182
00:57:49.951 --> 00:57:52.560
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of here with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought about it afterwards</v>

1183
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:54.270
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's some,</v>

1184
00:57:54.271 --> 00:57:58.650
<v Speaker 1>maybe I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always liked to explore my reactions</v>

1185
00:57:58.651 --> 00:58:02.940
<v Speaker 1>to things and if I had a reaction to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and I automatically dismiss</v>

1186
00:58:02.941 --> 00:58:03.271
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1187
00:58:03.271 --> 00:58:05.520
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that valid or did I just dismiss it?</v>

1188
00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Because it's easier than to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuanced perspective that's formed over</v>

1189
00:58:11.521 --> 00:58:16.521
<v Speaker 1>time and a lot of critical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I stopped and thought about it</v>

1190
00:58:16.771 --> 00:58:20.160
<v Speaker 1>all and I think at the very least it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that merits consideration and</v>

1191
00:58:20.161 --> 00:58:23.010
<v Speaker 1>maybe it could be a of some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>project.</v>

1192
00:58:23.011 --> 00:58:23.844
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1193
00:58:24.090 --> 00:58:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1194
00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:28.590
<v Speaker 1>we have some countries doing that right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now though.</v>

1195
00:58:28.591 --> 00:58:32.040
<v Speaker 1>They're different than us culturally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think culturally as part of it,</v>

1196
00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.510
<v Speaker 1>that is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1197
00:58:33.511 --> 00:58:38.511
<v Speaker 1>America is just so based on competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Competition is so powerful over here and</v>

1198
00:58:39.151 --> 00:58:42.300
<v Speaker 1>I think that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that's bad because</v>

1199
00:58:42.301 --> 00:58:46.490
<v Speaker 1>ultimately it's like if you could grab</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump and and,</v>

1200
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:51.630
<v Speaker 1>and get him on mushrooms and lead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain just somehow or another let the</v>

1201
00:58:52.201 --> 00:58:55.890
<v Speaker 1>universe explained to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a temporary experience.</v>

1202
00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:59.880
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to gather up all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>money and gather up all these resources</v>

1203
00:58:59.881 --> 00:59:04.080
<v Speaker 1>and gather up all this influence when</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all fleeting.</v>

1204
00:59:04.081 --> 00:59:06.090
<v Speaker 1>It's sand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's slips between your fingers.</v>

1205
00:59:06.091 --> 00:59:08.010
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can grasp it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

1206
00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:13.460
<v Speaker 1>The real experience is the shared</v>
<v Speaker 1>moments that we have with each other and</v>

1207
00:59:14.011 --> 00:59:16.950
<v Speaker 1>the more we can enhance that for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people around us,</v>

1208
00:59:16.951 --> 00:59:21.951
<v Speaker 1>the more you can use your power to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhance people's perspective,</v>

1209
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:27.970
<v Speaker 5>change people's way of interfacing with</v>
<v Speaker 5>this world that we live in and we</v>

1210
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:34.070
<v Speaker 5>recognize that we're all just living</v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

1211
00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:37.460
<v Speaker 5>We're all just a part of this community,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this competition thing.</v>

1212
00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:39.830
<v Speaker 5>Most of the competition is with</v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself,</v>

1213
00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:42.710
<v Speaker 5>most of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the vast majority of it,</v>

1214
00:59:42.711 --> 00:59:45.290
<v Speaker 5>and those other people that you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>competing with,</v>

1215
00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:48.350
<v Speaker 5>you should cherish them because their</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuel,</v>

1216
00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:50.690
<v Speaker 5>all those people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of looking at them as the enemy,</v>

1217
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:55.610
<v Speaker 5>those people are your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although your most bitter rivals are the</v>

1218
00:59:55.611 --> 00:59:57.740
<v Speaker 5>greatest motivators you're ever going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>experience.</v>

1219
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:59.360
<v Speaker 5>Those are the people that are going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>push you,</v>

1220
01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:01.840
<v Speaker 5>but don't be toxic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1221
01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.210
<v Speaker 5>you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can be.</v>

1222
01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.630
<v Speaker 5>You can be peaceful about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yet Joe,</v>

1223
01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:08.210
<v Speaker 5>I love competition because it's number</v>
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>

1224
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:10.340
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing to watch like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1225
01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:11.710
<v Speaker 5>low,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1226
01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.910
<v Speaker 5>Klitschko Anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joshua,</v>

1227
01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:16.490
<v Speaker 5>I think greatest fighter like the last</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 years,</v>

1228
01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.353
<v Speaker 5>like hazing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boxing,</v>

1229
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.360
<v Speaker 5>match for that boxing match,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Loma Chenko,</v>

1230
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.810
<v Speaker 5>Reagan's.</v>

1231
01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:22.820
<v Speaker 5>That's not competition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1232
01:00:22.850 --> 01:00:23.710
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

1233
01:00:23.711 --> 01:00:25.910
<v Speaker 5>that's an experienced though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1234
01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.100
<v Speaker 5>that's an experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Total diss snatching.</v>

1235
01:00:28.101 --> 01:00:28.791
<v Speaker 5>Have a soul.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1236
01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:31.360
<v Speaker 5>he's a different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Loma Cenk goes a different thing.</v>

1237
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:33.500
<v Speaker 5>The Matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know the story about his dad?</v>

1238
01:00:33.501 --> 01:00:37.910
<v Speaker 5>Would his dad made him do know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>made him stop boxing and do a Ukrainian</v>

1239
01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:41.660
<v Speaker 5>dance for four years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why he's got that ridiculous</v>

1240
01:00:41.661 --> 01:00:46.430
<v Speaker 5>footwork because footwork is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I know he does a number association</v>

1241
01:00:46.431 --> 01:00:47.540
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is crazy.</v>

1242
01:00:47.541 --> 01:00:50.220
<v Speaker 5>But what I was saying about competition</v>
<v Speaker 5>is like,</v>

1243
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:52.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pete piloting and was we need</v>

1244
01:00:52.821 --> 01:00:54.030
<v Speaker 5>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need competition.</v>

1245
01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.000
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but who is competing with service</v>

1246
01:00:56.001 --> 01:00:57.740
<v Speaker 5>providers?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is no competition.</v>

1247
01:00:57.741 --> 01:01:00.110
<v Speaker 5>It's just beating up on a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1248
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:03.110
<v Speaker 5>it's like we all live to watch great</v>
<v Speaker 5>competition,</v>

1249
01:01:03.111 --> 01:01:07.850
<v Speaker 5>but you have to foster competitors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need actual competitors for there to</v>

1250
01:01:07.851 --> 01:01:08.360
<v Speaker 5>be competent.</v>

1251
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.870
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if what we're experiencing with</v>
<v Speaker 5>Internet was also with food.</v>

1252
01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:16.340
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if like only certain people</v>
<v Speaker 5>could bring you your food.</v>

1253
01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:17.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know like,</v>

1254
01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.160
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you live in Charleston.</v>

1255
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:20.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you gotta get your food from Mike.</v>

1256
01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.870
<v Speaker 5>Yet it's basically like growing up</v>
<v Speaker 5>eating food in Orlando.</v>

1257
01:01:23.871 --> 01:01:27.200
<v Speaker 5>There's like one in a category of food</v>
<v Speaker 5>for your mind.</v>

1258
01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Food for your mind is real.</v>

1259
01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:32.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean the fuel that you get them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the information that you get from the</v>

1260
01:01:32.721 --> 01:01:35.720
<v Speaker 5>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is fuel for your mind and whether</v>

1261
01:01:35.721 --> 01:01:39.260
<v Speaker 5>you get it in the form of actual food or</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether you get it in the form of</v>

1262
01:01:39.261 --> 01:01:42.490
<v Speaker 5>information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are both very critical things that</v>

1263
01:01:42.491 --> 01:01:46.610
<v Speaker 5>you need a wide variety of different</v>
<v Speaker 5>sources for,</v>

1264
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.470
<v Speaker 5>but you bring up a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even just,</v>

1265
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.090
<v Speaker 5>let's say food delivery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1266
01:01:50.091 --> 01:01:52.400
<v Speaker 5>It started off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would call the restaurants and it</v>

1267
01:01:52.401 --> 01:01:53.030
<v Speaker 5>was difficult.</v>

1268
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:55.070
<v Speaker 5>You had to save the menu from every</v>
<v Speaker 5>restaurant.</v>

1269
01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:57.020
<v Speaker 5>Then seamless comes around and they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1270
01:01:57.021 --> 01:01:58.970
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're putting all the menus on here and</v>

1271
01:01:58.971 --> 01:02:01.940
<v Speaker 5>we're just helping facilitate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get things from the restaurant,</v>

1272
01:02:01.941 --> 01:02:06.470
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't like for restaurants we</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't necessarily like seamless because</v>

1273
01:02:06.471 --> 01:02:08.780
<v Speaker 5>then you had to have your own delivery</v>
<v Speaker 5>workforce.</v>

1274
01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:13.100
<v Speaker 5>They took a big cut of what you were</v>
<v Speaker 5>making and in a lot of restaurants they</v>

1275
01:02:13.101 --> 01:02:17.600
<v Speaker 5>didn't even break even using seamless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so then like places like caviar came</v>

1276
01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:21.090
<v Speaker 5>around and postmates came around and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they supply the service,</v>

1277
01:02:21.091 --> 01:02:24.450
<v Speaker 5>the delivery people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the consumer pays more for the delivery</v>

1278
01:02:24.451 --> 01:02:26.520
<v Speaker 5>and the restaurant makes their money and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1279
01:02:26.521 --> 01:02:29.010
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that actually created competition</v>

1280
01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:32.880
<v Speaker 5>between delivery services.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you have an evolution and now you</v>

1281
01:02:32.881 --> 01:02:37.830
<v Speaker 5>know everybody gets what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get service all happened over the</v>

1282
01:02:37.831 --> 01:02:41.580
<v Speaker 5>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was all kind of little little folded</v>

1283
01:02:41.581 --> 01:02:43.450
<v Speaker 5>menu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the kitchen drawer,</v>

1284
01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:44.363
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1285
01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:49.420
<v Speaker 5>Like that's how we used to do it and if</v>
<v Speaker 5>you lived in New York you get home and</v>

1286
01:02:49.421 --> 01:02:50.810
<v Speaker 5>it's just like 20 Sushi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>making</v>

1287
01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:57.810
<v Speaker 5>empire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>putting something under my door,</v>

1288
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:03.110
<v Speaker 5>a lot of slip and fall in your own</v>
<v Speaker 5>apartment cases from those wickets.</v>

1289
01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:05.670
<v Speaker 5>What happened and what's happened</v>
<v Speaker 5>through the Internet in terms of people</v>

1290
01:03:05.671 --> 01:03:08.190
<v Speaker 5>not drinking and driving because of</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uber.</v>

1291
01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:10.380
<v Speaker 5>That's changed the way people get</v>
<v Speaker 5>around.</v>

1292
01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:13.770
<v Speaker 5>If I went to high school with Uber,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would have been good.</v>

1293
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:14.421
<v Speaker 5>When.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When?</v>

1294
01:03:14.421 --> 01:03:15.930
<v Speaker 5>When were you in front of the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 5>store?</v>

1295
01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:19.560
<v Speaker 5>Lift is blocking the Goddamn driveway to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the comedy store.</v>

1296
01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:21.540
<v Speaker 5>Nine out of 10 times when you're allowed</v>
<v Speaker 5>to leave.</v>

1297
01:03:21.541 --> 01:03:23.820
<v Speaker 5>There's a car pulled up there which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1298
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:25.500
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an inconvenience,</v>

1299
01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:28.350
<v Speaker 5>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so nice to see drunk people just</v>

1300
01:03:28.351 --> 01:03:30.570
<v Speaker 5>getting driven around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They need to be.</v>

1301
01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.510
<v Speaker 5>They may be jumping around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting.</v>

1302
01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.800
<v Speaker 5>We don't talk a lot about the safety</v>
<v Speaker 5>element of that,</v>

1303
01:03:34.801 --> 01:03:39.300
<v Speaker 5>but it's so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also young people are not buying</v>

1304
01:03:39.301 --> 01:03:43.290
<v Speaker 5>cars like they used to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Used to be that getting a car entailed</v>

1305
01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:44.700
<v Speaker 5>your freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1306
01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:50.360
<v Speaker 5>And one more device centric where you go</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what you do with virtual physical</v>

1307
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.060
<v Speaker 5>car anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were segregated because I went to a</v>

1308
01:03:54.061 --> 01:03:56.910
<v Speaker 5>school where people were bused in from</v>
<v Speaker 5>different parts so you could be friends</v>

1309
01:03:56.911 --> 01:03:59.160
<v Speaker 5>with someone at school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if they don't have a car or they</v>

1310
01:03:59.161 --> 01:04:01.140
<v Speaker 5>live 45 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't be friends,</v>

1311
01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.690
<v Speaker 5>but now you can all meet each other up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can,</v>

1312
01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:04.590
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1313
01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:07.140
<v Speaker 5>they may not be able to rent the car or</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a car,</v>

1314
01:04:07.141 --> 01:04:09.240
<v Speaker 5>but they can take uber and meet you up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1315
01:04:09.241 --> 01:04:12.750
<v Speaker 5>And that really is another aspect of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Internet that a lot of times we don't</v>

1316
01:04:12.751 --> 01:04:16.380
<v Speaker 5>take into consideration is cellular,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mobile apps,</v>

1317
01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:17.550
<v Speaker 5>apps are the Internet.</v>

1318
01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:19.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean it is everything through the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Internet,</v>

1319
01:04:19.411 --> 01:04:23.250
<v Speaker 5>but it's in this little device that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep in your pocket and twitter,</v>

1320
01:04:23.310 --> 01:04:27.030
<v Speaker 5>facebook and instagram and all these</v>
<v Speaker 5>different live in a mobile first world.</v>

1321
01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:31.480
<v Speaker 5>Anyone who's building a website now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it should be built for that device</v>

1322
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:36.710
<v Speaker 5>because that's the first place most</v>
<v Speaker 5>people experience that online.</v>

1323
01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.700
<v Speaker 5>And the only concern that I have about</v>
<v Speaker 5>that though is that,</v>

1324
01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:43.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ultimately we want people to not just be</v>

1325
01:04:43.861 --> 01:04:46.530
<v Speaker 5>digital consumers but to be digital</v>
<v Speaker 5>creators.</v>

1326
01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:52.310
<v Speaker 5>And some people</v>
<v Speaker 5>think more of us should be.</v>

1327
01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:55.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think people building things</v>

1328
01:04:55.801 --> 01:04:56.431
<v Speaker 5>should be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1329
01:04:56.431 --> 01:04:58.170
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of guys in hoodies in their</v>
<v Speaker 5>twenties.</v>

1330
01:04:58.171 --> 01:05:00.270
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1331
01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.440
<v Speaker 5>I agree with the digital world should</v>
<v Speaker 5>look as diverse as all of us.</v>

1332
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

1333
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:08.400
<v Speaker 5>I hope on a going forward basis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to fix this internet</v>

1334
01:05:08.401 --> 01:05:09.840
<v Speaker 5>situation with net neutrality.</v>

1335
01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:14.010
<v Speaker 5>And we're also going to diversify the</v>
<v Speaker 5>universe of people who build things for</v>

1336
01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:14.960
<v Speaker 5>our online more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1337
01:05:14.970 --> 01:05:19.090
<v Speaker 5>we really see that in the podcast world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The podcast world is extremely diverse.</v>

1338
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:22.420
<v Speaker 5>There's so many different Po.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean whatever you're into,</v>

1339
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:26.290
<v Speaker 5>you can find a category and a whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>shitload of people that are making</v>

1340
01:05:26.291 --> 01:05:30.340
<v Speaker 5>podcasts about it and it's really sad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five podcasts on sleeping.</v>

1341
01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:35.700
<v Speaker 5>You probably haven't done a ton on food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1342
01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:39.700
<v Speaker 5>Food food is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was working on this net</v>

1343
01:05:39.701 --> 01:05:43.150
<v Speaker 5>neutrality should I have worked with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>today show and they wanted to find</v>

1344
01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:46.930
<v Speaker 5>someone who built a business online and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they spent time with this woman,</v>

1345
01:05:46.931 --> 01:05:50.950
<v Speaker 5>I think it was Laura's kitchen and she</v>
<v Speaker 5>had basically started just putting</v>

1346
01:05:50.951 --> 01:05:54.640
<v Speaker 5>videos on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 5>showing herself and how she was cooking</v>

1347
01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:58.510
<v Speaker 5>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that morphed over time into a book and a</v>

1348
01:05:58.511 --> 01:06:01.660
<v Speaker 5>big empire and she built something from</v>
<v Speaker 5>it and it's amazing.</v>

1349
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:06.660
<v Speaker 5>If you look at how much cooking has</v>
<v Speaker 5>evolved from just hobby online to actual</v>

1350
01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:09.430
<v Speaker 5>business,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's extraordinary.</v>

1351
01:06:09.431 --> 01:06:11.440
<v Speaker 5>It's undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean for,</v>

1352
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:12.980
<v Speaker 5>for younger people listening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

1353
01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:14.470
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're probably just like guys,</v>

1354
01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.180
<v Speaker 5>we know like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like everything.</v>

1355
01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.200
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's undoubted.</v>

1356
01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:22.270
<v Speaker 5>Everything happens on the Internet and</v>
<v Speaker 5>so for it to become this thing that's</v>

1357
01:06:22.271 --> 01:06:25.600
<v Speaker 5>not regulated is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's like getting our roads</v>

1358
01:06:25.601 --> 01:06:27.820
<v Speaker 5>taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want like regulation,</v>

1359
01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:31.000
<v Speaker 5>which you want is just a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 5>oversight to make sure that it's fair.</v>

1360
01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:33.910
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a good way to put it</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I don't.</v>

1361
01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.490
<v Speaker 5>I think when we break in a regulation or</v>
<v Speaker 5>deregulation,</v>

1362
01:06:36.491 --> 01:06:38.410
<v Speaker 5>we lose the point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The point is you just want a little</v>

1363
01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:42.410
<v Speaker 5>oversight to make sure it's fair and</v>
<v Speaker 5>open to all equal playing ground in that</v>

1364
01:06:42.490 --> 01:06:47.050
<v Speaker 5>everybody's allowed to come to this and</v>
<v Speaker 5>recognize it as an important resource</v>

1365
01:06:47.051 --> 01:06:47.590
<v Speaker 5>that it is.</v>

1366
01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:51.820
<v Speaker 5>The ability to distribute information is</v>
<v Speaker 5>critical to changing the culture,</v>

1367
01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:54.940
<v Speaker 5>the way we interface with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way we talk,</v>

1368
01:06:55.090 --> 01:07:00.090
<v Speaker 5>the experiences that we share,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way we have access to all these new</v>

1369
01:07:00.221 --> 01:07:03.340
<v Speaker 5>ideas and information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just shifting things that this</v>

1370
01:07:03.341 --> 01:07:05.920
<v Speaker 5>radical warp speed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>warp speed,</v>

1371
01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:07.090
<v Speaker 5>warp speed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just.</v>

1372
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:12.190
<v Speaker 5>It's the weirdest time ever and so for</v>
<v Speaker 5>this to be a monkey wrench thrown into</v>

1373
01:07:13.061 --> 01:07:16.120
<v Speaker 5>the gears of this by five people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three shoes,</v>

1374

<v Speaker 5>three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

1375
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:20.270
<v Speaker 5>present company.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1376
01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:21.590
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1377
01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:24.010
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to imagine that that's going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to stick,</v>

1378
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:28.030
<v Speaker 5>but with this administration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not stunning because it seems like</v>

1379
01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:33.250
<v Speaker 5>net neutrality being dissolved favors</v>
<v Speaker 5>these big businesses that would like to</v>

1380
01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.760
<v Speaker 5>maximize their profits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Net neutrality is the ultimate</v>

1381
01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:37.870
<v Speaker 5>populist issue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1382
01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:41.860
<v Speaker 5>Because it empowers all of us online.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

1383
01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

1384
01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:47.620
<v Speaker 5>So write letters,</v>

1385

<v Speaker 5>You have to be annoying.</v>

1386
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:50.430
<v Speaker 5>Run,</v>
<v Speaker 5>run,</v>

1387
01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:55.270
<v Speaker 5>run for president</v>
<v Speaker 5>in 2020 Eddie and Oprah.</v>

1388
01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:56.193
<v Speaker 5>Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

1389
01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:58.300
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Joe's a good ticket,</v>

1390
01:07:58.301 --> 01:07:59.230
<v Speaker 5>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing it,</v>

1391
01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:01.350
<v Speaker 5>but good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good luck.</v>

1392
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:04.990
<v Speaker 5>You and Oprah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you're going to be living your</v>

1393
01:08:04.991 --> 01:08:07.960
<v Speaker 5>best life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's that mean?</v>

1394
01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:11.580
<v Speaker 5>What does oprah appraisal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my bad boy.</v>

1395
01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:13.330
<v Speaker 5>Oprah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that part of the secret?</v>

1396
01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:15.230
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have to work with your</v>
<v Speaker 5>running mate on that.</v>

1397
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:18.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1398
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.393
<v Speaker 1>this</v>

1399
01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:20.860
<v Speaker 2>w,</v>

1400
01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:23.560
<v Speaker 1>the situation that we're in right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

1401
01:08:23.561 --> 01:08:27.550
<v Speaker 1>are you confident that there is real</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential for it to be reversed?</v>

1402
01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I am optimistic that the American public</v>
<v Speaker 2>are awoke and they're paying attention</v>

1403
01:08:34.951 --> 01:08:36.990
<v Speaker 2>now and they're making a Ruckus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1404
01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:41.310
<v Speaker 2>we had millions of people write us at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the FCC when I got appointed to the FCC,</v>

1405
01:08:41.311 --> 01:08:44.460
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think millions of people knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the FCC was.</v>

1406
01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:48.480
<v Speaker 2>I think that's extraordinary and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>ready to give up.</v>

1407
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last time the FCC was in the</v>

1408
01:08:51.071 --> 01:08:53.770
<v Speaker 1>mainstream news is when you guys were</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding Howard Stern.</v>

1409
01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:58.690
<v Speaker 1>That predates my tough course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that was also during the George</v>

1410
01:08:58.690 --> 01:09:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Bush administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd you get to the FCC?</v>

1411
01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:06.240
<v Speaker 2>So before I was appointed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I served as counsel to the Senate</v>

1412
01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Commerce Committee and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked there for Senator Rockefeller</v>

1413
01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:16.150
<v Speaker 2>for a long time and first senator in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way before that.</v>

1414
01:09:16.690 --> 01:09:18.320
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

1415
01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:23.110
<v Speaker 2>I got like a front row seat at a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of digital issues with how we deal</v>

1416
01:09:23.111 --> 01:09:26.800
<v Speaker 2>with our wireless spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we change our television technology.</v>

1417
01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.301
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1418
01:09:28.301 --> 01:09:31.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm a real kind of nerdy Washington</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1419
01:09:31.091 --> 01:09:35.740
<v Speaker 2>but also a new way to see how everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>is changing in our economy because of</v>

1420
01:09:35.741 --> 01:09:38.680
<v Speaker 2>digitization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your thoughts on</v>

1421
01:09:38.681 --> 01:09:41.470
<v Speaker 2>cryptocurrencies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1422
01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I have no special authority on this</v>

1423
01:09:44.741 --> 01:09:46.330
<v Speaker 2>except that have microphones in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1424
01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:47.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that being said,</v>

1425
01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:49.593
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1426
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm less interested in cryptocurrencies</v>

1427
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:57.760
<v Speaker 2>than I am in Blockchain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the ledger that they use to re</v>

1428
01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:02.900
<v Speaker 2>to record exchanges in cryptocurrency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's anonymous and it can be used by</v>

1429
01:10:06.821 --> 01:10:07.390
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>

1430
01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:11.230
<v Speaker 2>It's extremely low cost and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're open questions about how you can</v>

1431
01:10:11.231 --> 01:10:16.231
<v Speaker 2>make government and a lot of business</v>
<v Speaker 2>services more efficient using blockchain</v>

1432
01:10:16.961 --> 01:10:21.250
<v Speaker 2>that I think are really interesting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have yet to be explored.</v>

1433
01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:24.430
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm excited about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's one way a business could use</v>

1434
01:10:24.431 --> 01:10:26.740
<v Speaker 2>blockchain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1435
01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.680
<v Speaker 2>I'll just make this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say there's some kind of a,</v>

1436
01:10:29.681 --> 01:10:33.490
<v Speaker 2>you export fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone puts a bag of that fruit on the</v>

1437
01:10:33.491 --> 01:10:34.450
<v Speaker 2>table and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1438
01:10:34.451 --> 01:10:37.090
<v Speaker 2>we know that there are certain fields</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fruit comes from,</v>

1439
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:38.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there might be a disease in it.</v>

1440
01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:42.670
<v Speaker 2>How can you figure out how that fruit</v>
<v Speaker 2>got here from the field?</v>

1441
01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:44.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go back through your supply</v>

1442
01:10:44.321 --> 01:10:49.000
<v Speaker 2>chain and call everyone and get them to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you how long it sat over here and</v>

1443
01:10:49.001 --> 01:10:52.240
<v Speaker 2>who held it and put it in the truck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

1444
01:10:52.241 --> 01:10:55.270
<v Speaker 2>if you can come up with a digital way</v>
<v Speaker 2>where everyone as a collective just</v>

1445
01:10:55.271 --> 01:10:58.390
<v Speaker 2>contributes to that along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can that be low cost?</v>

1446
01:10:58.391 --> 01:11:02.620
<v Speaker 2>More efficient and more effective?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it will change supply chain</v>

1447
01:11:02.770 --> 01:11:07.770
<v Speaker 2>economics in a really big way and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fully understand the consequences</v>

1448
01:11:08.981 --> 01:11:10.960
<v Speaker 2>for our economy yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's coming.</v>

1449
01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1450
01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like a wikipedia</v>

1451
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:15.420
<v Speaker 1>for each thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1452
01:11:15.421 --> 01:11:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Did it with food for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1453
01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:17.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1454
01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:18.031
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1455
01:11:18.031 --> 01:11:19.230
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1456
01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:20.930
<v Speaker 1>That makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No dogs.</v>

1457
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1458
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1459
01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:23.550
<v Speaker 2>you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

1460
01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.320
<v Speaker 2>here's high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high level nerd,</v>

1461
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:28.350
<v Speaker 2>but our airwaves around us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1462
01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Our wireless airwaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that power,</v>

1463
01:11:29.941 --> 01:11:32.190
<v Speaker 2>all of our phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to divide them up.</v>

1464
01:11:32.191 --> 01:11:34.200
<v Speaker 2>You don't see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like if there's a zone so that</v>

1465
01:11:34.201 --> 01:11:35.940
<v Speaker 2>your phone works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the television works,</v>

1466
01:11:35.941 --> 01:11:37.230
<v Speaker 2>all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1467
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:41.040
<v Speaker 2>but we also have a whole bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>airwaves that are only used sometimes,</v>

1468
01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:45.300
<v Speaker 2>but what if we could create like</v>
<v Speaker 2>secondary and tertiary rights to use</v>

1469
01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:48.000
<v Speaker 2>them so that our phones were more</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

1470
01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:51.900
<v Speaker 2>And what if the best way to do that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use something like blockchain.</v>

1471
01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many ways I think the</v>

1472
01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:58.980
<v Speaker 2>recording ledger for cryptocurrencies</v>
<v Speaker 2>could make our economy more efficient</v>

1473
01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:02.370
<v Speaker 2>and more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what I'm interested in and</v>

1474
01:12:02.371 --> 01:12:04.240
<v Speaker 2>that's probably because I don't own any</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin.</v>

1475
01:12:04.241 --> 01:12:04.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1476
01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I know people also in journalism have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been talking about keeping articles on</v>

1477
01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:11.600
<v Speaker 1>blockchain so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Internet articles don't go</v>

1478
01:12:11.601 --> 01:12:12.820
<v Speaker 1>anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1479
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:15.490
<v Speaker 1>because people can just erase a website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a website,</v>

1480
01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:17.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes out of business.</v>

1481
01:12:17.211 --> 01:12:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Then all of the articles on that website</v>
<v Speaker 1>are gone.</v>

1482
01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:22.010
<v Speaker 1>So some people are putting websites on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jean,</v>

1483
01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:26.880
<v Speaker 2>figuring out how we maintain our history</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this digital world is actually,</v>

1484
01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:28.140
<v Speaker 2>it's a real thing.</v>

1485
01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1486
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Especially a lot about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like cultural preservation,</v>

1487
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:35.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we have some sort of a solar flare</v>

1488
01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:40.920
<v Speaker 1>and it kills the grid and we lose hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>drives and we there,</v>

1489
01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.520
<v Speaker 1>that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually could be a real thing.</v>

1490
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and blockchain.</v>

1491
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:48.120
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of an answer from keeping</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

1492
01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:52.350
<v Speaker 1>My hope is that we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually shift to voting online.</v>

1493
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Does it do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that?</v>

1494
01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:59.510
<v Speaker 2>I think the state of Oregon that makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments with that,</v>

1495
01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.720
<v Speaker 2>we should study that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should make voting easier.</v>

1496
01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it comes down to and make it</v>

1497
01:13:05.451 --> 01:13:07.730
<v Speaker 1>more convenient for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the thought is,</v>

1498
01:13:07.731 --> 01:13:08.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're so stupid,</v>

1499
01:13:08.961 --> 01:13:10.610
<v Speaker 1>lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't make their way to a voting</v>

1500
01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.080
<v Speaker 1>booth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we really want their opinion to be</v>

1501
01:13:12.081 --> 01:13:16.610
<v Speaker 1>expressed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the busiest politician we talked</v>

1502
01:13:16.611 --> 01:13:19.330
<v Speaker 1>about politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just let us know</v>

1503
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:25.570
<v Speaker 1>you have a job.</v>

1504
01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:28.510
<v Speaker 2>If you've got kids you're trying to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>there for now and then you find out your</v>

1505
01:13:28.511 --> 01:13:31.390
<v Speaker 2>polling place is open from nine to five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1506
01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:32.920
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insulting.</v>

1507
01:13:32.921 --> 01:13:34.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that when I voted in the</v>

1508
01:13:34.601 --> 01:13:36.490
<v Speaker 2>election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last election,</v>

1509
01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.760
<v Speaker 2>presidential election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can guess the last election</v>

1510
01:13:40.090 --> 01:13:43.990
<v Speaker 2>in Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to wait 35 minutes before I got</v>

1511
01:13:43.991 --> 01:13:47.000
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of my day also.</v>

1512
01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:48.000
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1513
01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.930
<v Speaker 2>that's a commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a commitment I'm willing to make.</v>

1514
01:13:49.931 --> 01:13:52.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm privileged enough to take that time</v>

1515
01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:54.420
<v Speaker 2>and make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to make it easier.</v>

1516
01:13:54.570 --> 01:13:57.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm absolutely joking around and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>really do think that we should make it</v>

1517
01:13:57.421 --> 01:14:00.180
<v Speaker 1>much easier to vote and I think you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be registered to vote the same</v>

1518
01:14:00.181 --> 01:14:03.150
<v Speaker 1>way you're registered to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you have a driver's license,</v>

1519
01:14:03.151 --> 01:14:04.320
<v Speaker 1>I think you should be registered to</v>
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>

1520
01:14:04.321 --> 01:14:07.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be just that easy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should be able to do it</v>

1521
01:14:07.651 --> 01:14:10.500
<v Speaker 1>online and I think if you have a social</v>
<v Speaker 1>security number,</v>

1522
01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be</v>

1523
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.010
<v Speaker 5>really using and I think that's not</v>
<v Speaker 5>outside the realm of possibility.</v>

1524
01:14:15.011 --> 01:14:16.960
<v Speaker 5>I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're operating on these antiquated</v>

1525
01:14:16.961 --> 01:14:21.910
<v Speaker 5>systems and we've accepted them as fact</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is the way things are and I</v>

1526
01:14:21.911 --> 01:14:24.250
<v Speaker 5>just think that it's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a good system.</v>

1527
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.480
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1528
01:14:25.481 --> 01:14:28.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean like if you live in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember when I was trying to vote in</v>

1529
01:14:28.301 --> 01:14:30.040
<v Speaker 5>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the polling stations were in</v>

1530
01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:35.041
<v Speaker 5>churches and I'd go and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was an uncomfortable thing to go to a</v>

1531
01:14:35.561 --> 01:14:38.500
<v Speaker 5>church where I'm pretty much the only</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chinese guy voting,</v>

1532
01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:41.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people say really wild things</v>

1533
01:14:41.681 --> 01:14:43.600
<v Speaker 5>to you in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you're waiting to vote.</v>

1534
01:14:43.601 --> 01:14:45.310
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would have to vote online.</v>

1535
01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:49.540
<v Speaker 5>Like when they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well you probably go on for the carry,</v>

1536
01:14:49.541 --> 01:14:50.440
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1537
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:55.450
<v Speaker 5>Because it's like the John Kerry year</v>
<v Speaker 5>for carry and it's not your business</v>

1538
01:14:55.781 --> 01:14:56.830
<v Speaker 5>bro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1539
01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:59.330
<v Speaker 5>But also I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why do I have to go vote at a church?</v>

1540
01:14:59.331 --> 01:15:02.740
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't go to this church.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Peanut gets so intense when it comes to</v>

1541
01:15:02.741 --> 01:15:06.730
<v Speaker 5>voting comes struggle as are super</v>
<v Speaker 5>intense and you know,</v>

1542
01:15:06.731 --> 01:15:07.331
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1543
01:15:07.331 --> 01:15:09.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people just say things to you in a</v>

1544
01:15:09.191 --> 01:15:12.010
<v Speaker 5>voting line and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this discourages a lot of people that</v>

1545
01:15:12.011 --> 01:15:14.140
<v Speaker 5>may have a minority opinion in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood.</v>

1546
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:17.110
<v Speaker 5>I think you should have some sort of an</v>
<v Speaker 5>understanding about what you're voting</v>

1547
01:15:17.111 --> 01:15:17.944
<v Speaker 5>for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two,</v>

1548
01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:20.800
<v Speaker 5>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would like voting to be much easier,</v>

1549
01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:24.070
<v Speaker 5>but I would also like there to be some</v>
<v Speaker 5>accountability.</v>

1550
01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.960
<v Speaker 5>Like you should know what you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually voting.</v>

1551
01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:30.880
<v Speaker 5>Maybe there should be like some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a quick online poll or some sort of a</v>

1552
01:15:30.881 --> 01:15:35.881
<v Speaker 5>quick online candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that violates the constitution.</v>

1553
01:15:36.821 --> 01:15:38.320
<v Speaker 5>So I'm just going to say that does it.</v>

1554
01:15:38.890 --> 01:15:40.480
<v Speaker 5>The constitution has nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Internet.</v>

1555
01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:42.010
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing back then.</v>

1556
01:15:42.011 --> 01:15:45.600
<v Speaker 5>The constitutional meaning like old ass</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

1557
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:49.180
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to test for voting.</v>

1558
01:15:49.181 --> 01:15:53.020
<v Speaker 5>I think we're just expressing the</v>
<v Speaker 5>frustration where like a lot of people</v>

1559
01:15:53.021 --> 01:15:56.160
<v Speaker 5>just get ushered in like sheep to go</v>
<v Speaker 5>vote for people.</v>

1560
01:15:56.190 --> 01:15:59.200
<v Speaker 5>I think you're expressing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want there to be accountability.</v>

1561
01:15:59.230 --> 01:16:01.600
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you want people to be aware,</v>

1562
01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:03.460
<v Speaker 5>I would like people to know what they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>voting about.</v>

1563
01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:06.670
<v Speaker 5>Participation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could answer what your vote if you</v>

1564
01:16:06.671 --> 01:16:08.110
<v Speaker 5>understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1565
01:16:08.111 --> 01:16:10.120
<v Speaker 5>like maybe there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of,</v>

1566
01:16:10.121 --> 01:16:12.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an amendment that's being passed or</v>

1567
01:16:12.521 --> 01:16:16.720
<v Speaker 5>something's being passed where you don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>understand exactly what you're getting</v>

1568
01:16:16.721 --> 01:16:21.721
<v Speaker 5>into and maybe there should be a way</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we find out if you understand it,</v>

1569
01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:24.280
<v Speaker 5>I know that you have the good intentions</v>
<v Speaker 5>for it.</v>

1570
01:16:24.281 --> 01:16:28.330
<v Speaker 5>But I read these cases that once you</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a test for people to vote,</v>

1571
01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:30.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean the powers that be.</v>

1572
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:32.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean look at Gerrymandering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1573
01:16:32.591 --> 01:16:35.430
<v Speaker 5>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anytime you introduce that it,</v>

1574
01:16:35.770 --> 01:16:38.560
<v Speaker 5>it always sets like the populace back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I do,</v>

1575
01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:43.360
<v Speaker 5>I do really connect with joe sentiment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like a lot of people voting</v>

1576
01:16:43.361 --> 01:16:46.450
<v Speaker 5>aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't actually participating</v>

1577
01:16:46.451 --> 01:16:48.180
<v Speaker 5>consciously in the process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1578
01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:48.821
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

1579
01:16:48.821 --> 01:16:53.821
<v Speaker 5>I think being a citizens of job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you actually spend some time and think</v>

1580
01:16:54.491 --> 01:16:57.550
<v Speaker 5>about what's your authorizing for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

1581
01:16:57.551 --> 01:17:00.310
<v Speaker 5>what the future's going to look like and</v>
<v Speaker 5>how you're going to participate in</v>

1582
01:17:00.311 --> 01:17:04.360
<v Speaker 5>shaping it merely by voting I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a real job and I think more</v>

1583
01:17:04.361 --> 01:17:06.550
<v Speaker 5>people are aware of that now than they</v>
<v Speaker 5>used to be.</v>

1584
01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:08.770
<v Speaker 5>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so much to pay attention to.</v>

1585
01:17:08.910 --> 01:17:12.290
<v Speaker 5>It is every time lasting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right is when the elections come around</v>

1586
01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:17.291
<v Speaker 5>and you just realize all the different</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that are up and you just go over</v>

1587
01:17:17.361 --> 01:17:20.780
<v Speaker 5>all the different issues and all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>different possibilities and you're like,</v>

1588
01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.430
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1589
01:17:22.710 --> 01:17:24.410
<v Speaker 5>I know what I did in California last</v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1590
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:26.040
<v Speaker 5>Like all the propositions are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>

1591
01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:29.100
<v Speaker 5>this is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually an interesting,</v>

1592
01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:33.440
<v Speaker 5>but the local stuff is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We spent so much time talking about</v>

1593
01:17:33.441 --> 01:17:37.400
<v Speaker 5>national elections,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who around you who really have</v>

1594
01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:42.401
<v Speaker 5>power to change your life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your most local representatives and</v>

1595
01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:46.610
<v Speaker 5>sometimes I worry that we pay the least</v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of tension to those races.</v>

1596
01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.470
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We dropped down the street and you see</v>

1597
01:17:48.471 --> 01:17:52.100
<v Speaker 5>some guys got a sign on his lawn for</v>
<v Speaker 5>some dude running for some shit you</v>

1598
01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:53.300
<v Speaker 5>didn't even know was up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

1599
01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:57.650
<v Speaker 5>is he a politician or a realtor?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many people do they even need to win</v>

1600
01:17:57.651 --> 01:17:59.420
<v Speaker 5>one of those elections?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1601
01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:01.130
<v Speaker 5>That's where you start,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eddie.</v>

1602
01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:04.070
<v Speaker 5>That's where you start your empire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>San Gabriel Valley.</v>

1603
01:18:04.071 --> 01:18:05.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Before you run,</v>

1604
01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:09.200
<v Speaker 5>you're the vice president with Oprah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what you gotta do.</v>

1605
01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:10.340
<v Speaker 5>I can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1606
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:12.220
<v Speaker 5>I can't do get a car.</v>

1607
01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:16.940
<v Speaker 5>Everyone gets a</v>
<v Speaker 5>basic income.</v>

1608
01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:19.970
<v Speaker 5>Everyone is 60 g's 60.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what the universal.</v>

1609
01:18:20.490 --> 01:18:21.980
<v Speaker 5>If you can't get 30,</v>
<v Speaker 5>30,</v>

1610
01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:22.940
<v Speaker 5>30,</v>
<v Speaker 5>32.</v>

1611
01:18:22.941 --> 01:18:24.800
<v Speaker 5>What we settled on was 30 last time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thirty.</v>

1612
01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.960
<v Speaker 5>Thirty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seems like you could get by.</v>

1613
01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:28.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1614
01:18:28.041 --> 01:18:29.570
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to get rich.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to get by.</v>

1615
01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:30.740
<v Speaker 5>Which is good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thirty five.</v>

1616
01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:35.560
<v Speaker 5>I think 30 is a good place to start</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying it out in some place with 12 once</v>

1617
01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:39.910
<v Speaker 5>a month to 50 a week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thirty is good with some like alright.</v>

1618
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:41.720
<v Speaker 5>If you do get a job and you make some</v>
<v Speaker 5>money,</v>

1619
01:18:41.730 --> 01:18:44.070
<v Speaker 5>were you really paying some taxes?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1620
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:48.740
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a way that automation is not</v>

1621
01:18:48.741 --> 01:18:53.390
<v Speaker 5>going to hit the economy at the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>time or all sectors of the economy at</v>

1622
01:18:53.391 --> 01:18:58.280
<v Speaker 5>the same time in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think it's coming faster than we</v>

1623
01:18:58.281 --> 01:18:59.990
<v Speaker 5>think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not that I'm wishing for this.</v>

1624
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:04.190
<v Speaker 5>I just think it it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is because my stocks and robotics</v>

1625
01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:07.400
<v Speaker 5>keep going up that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's my evidence.</v>

1626
01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.910
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Elon Musk is fairly convinced that</v>

1627
01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:11.780
<v Speaker 5>universal basic incomes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way to go,</v>

1628
01:19:12.170 --> 01:19:15.380
<v Speaker 5>he thinks that in the future that's just</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be inevitable because there's</v>

1629
01:19:15.381 --> 01:19:16.940
<v Speaker 5>going to be so many things that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>automated.</v>

1630
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:18.680
<v Speaker 5>Just can be so many people that are out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of work.</v>

1631
01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:21.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although I think it will change our</v>

1632
01:19:21.321 --> 01:19:25.670
<v Speaker 5>conception of work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we do to be productive individuals.</v>

1633
01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.070
<v Speaker 5>People work too much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's for sure.</v>

1634
01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:30.860
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people would work way too much.</v>

1635
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:32.960
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're live and then you're dead and you</v>

1636
01:19:32.961 --> 01:19:35.780
<v Speaker 5>have a heart attack when you're 60.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that really what we're doing?</v>

1637
01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:37.400
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't there a better way?</v>

1638
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:39.110
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how about working three days a week,</v>

1639
01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:42.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or four days a week for three off.</v>

1640
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:45.110
<v Speaker 5>Four on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That seems reasonable.</v>

1641
01:19:45.170 --> 01:19:48.020
<v Speaker 5>I work seven,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's love so I don't feel like it's</v>

1642
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:49.790
<v Speaker 5>work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but none of my stuff actually.</v>

1643
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:52.700
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many days would you do the podcast?</v>

1644
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.040
<v Speaker 5>I do it a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I have other jobs.</v>

1645
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:58.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You stand up and do the UFC commentary.</v>

1646
01:19:58.101 --> 01:19:59.630
<v Speaker 5>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but none of them are jobs.</v>

1647
01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.250
<v Speaker 5>Same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is barely.</v>

1648
01:20:01.670 --> 01:20:02.920
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1649
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:04.680
<v Speaker 5>but also you're your own boss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

1650
01:20:04.830 --> 01:20:09.060
<v Speaker 5>which makes work way different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Makes it different things very different</v>

1651
01:20:09.061 --> 01:20:10.750
<v Speaker 5>than it is for most people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1652
01:20:11.010 --> 01:20:12.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I want most people to</v>

1653
01:20:12.631 --> 01:20:15.330
<v Speaker 5>escape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want them to escape the grind of</v>

1654
01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:19.890
<v Speaker 5>having to be somewhere because someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>tells you have to have to do something</v>

1655
01:20:19.891 --> 01:20:21.330
<v Speaker 5>because someone tells you you have to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1656
01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:23.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Getting a small amount of money.</v>

1657
01:20:23.161 --> 01:20:26.760
<v Speaker 5>Why other people make more?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think that the economy</v>

1658
01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:27.650
<v Speaker 2>always changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1659
01:20:27.651 --> 01:20:29.730
<v Speaker 2>it used to be that you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1660
01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:33.170
<v Speaker 2>there was an employer with many</v>
<v Speaker 2>employees.</v>

1661
01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.490
<v Speaker 2>I think increasingly we're all gonna be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1662
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:41.590
<v Speaker 2>the employee with many employers in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have a web of contracts</v>

1663
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:46.880
<v Speaker 2>and activities that we use to sustain</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves economically over time.</v>

1664
01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:51.530
<v Speaker 2>I think you saw that developing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet and the new platforms that are</v>

1665
01:20:51.531 --> 01:20:53.170
<v Speaker 2>coming on board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1666
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:57.020
<v Speaker 2>there's consequences of that for</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare and other issues that I don't</v>

1667
01:20:57.021 --> 01:21:00.560
<v Speaker 2>think we fully tackled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that there is change coming</v>

1668
01:21:00.561 --> 01:21:04.670
<v Speaker 2>that lifetime employment and preparing</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it with a single degree out of high</v>

1669
01:21:04.671 --> 01:21:08.960
<v Speaker 2>school is I think something that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to look like a historical moment</v>

1670
01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:10.750
<v Speaker 5>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1671
01:21:10.751 --> 01:21:14.810
<v Speaker 5>there's a johnny naysayers out there</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I always get frustrated by it.</v>

1672
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:15.760
<v Speaker 5>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah man,</v>

1673
01:21:15.761 --> 01:21:18.610
<v Speaker 5>not everybody can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not everybody can work for themselves.</v>

1674
01:21:18.611 --> 01:21:19.720
<v Speaker 5>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guess what?</v>

1675
01:21:20.050 --> 01:21:24.370
<v Speaker 5>We're not talking to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're not capable,</v>

1676
01:21:24.430 --> 01:21:26.260
<v Speaker 5>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's a lot of people out there</v>

1677
01:21:26.261 --> 01:21:28.390
<v Speaker 5>that are capable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just aren't doing it.</v>

1678
01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:29.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're scared.</v>

1679
01:21:29.710 --> 01:21:31.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they don't have to be.</v>

1680
01:21:31.371 --> 01:21:34.990
<v Speaker 5>Because we were all scared.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody was scared and it seemed like</v>

1681
01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:38.470
<v Speaker 5>comfort and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1682
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:41.320
<v Speaker 5>and having some sort of security,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a real,</v>

1683
01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:44.740
<v Speaker 5>a real need that a lot of people have</v>
<v Speaker 5>that confidence,</v>

1684
01:21:44.741 --> 01:21:47.460
<v Speaker 5>security and knowing that your bill is</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be paid and everything's going</v>

1685
01:21:47.461 --> 01:21:49.060
<v Speaker 5>to be taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1686
01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:52.120
<v Speaker 5>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's hard for people to shake off.</v>

1687
01:21:52.150 --> 01:21:54.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Comfort is also a huge weakness.</v>

1688
01:21:54.041 --> 01:21:55.870
<v Speaker 5>I think at times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a lot of times,</v>

1689
01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:57.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're too comfortable,</v>

1690
01:21:57.341 --> 01:21:59.920
<v Speaker 5>you become complacent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like challenges,</v>

1691
01:21:59.921 --> 01:22:02.440
<v Speaker 5>failures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that's where I really start to</v>

1692
01:22:02.441 --> 01:22:05.110
<v Speaker 5>examine myself and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might be better tomorrow.</v>

1693
01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:07.540
<v Speaker 5>Growth in comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't go together.</v>

1694
01:22:07.570 --> 01:22:08.403
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1695
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:10.090
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for anybody.</v>

1696
01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:12.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then people get families and then</v>

1697
01:22:12.341 --> 01:22:14.140
<v Speaker 5>when you get families you don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>take any risks.</v>

1698
01:22:15.010 --> 01:22:16.870
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a problem as well.</v>

1699
01:22:16.930 --> 01:22:19.130
<v Speaker 5>People have mortgages and children and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1700
01:22:19.131 --> 01:22:22.930
<v Speaker 5>they don't want to do anything that</v>
<v Speaker 5>might put them in the unemployment line.</v>

1701
01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:25.450
<v Speaker 2>To be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That can be a really smart and</v>

1702
01:22:25.451 --> 01:22:29.110
<v Speaker 2>responsible choice at some point when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of people relying on you,</v>

1703
01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:31.500
<v Speaker 2>that's the most rational thing do.</v>

1704
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:33.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a real problem.</v>

1705
01:22:33.530 --> 01:22:35.720
<v Speaker 5>Like a Black Jack Dealer told me last</v>
<v Speaker 5>week,</v>

1706
01:22:35.721 --> 01:22:37.010
<v Speaker 5>scared money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't make money.</v>

1707
01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:40.640
<v Speaker 5>You say I go try and double down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>double down,</v>

1708
01:22:40.670 --> 01:22:42.050
<v Speaker 5>double down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm showing a four.</v>

1709
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:44.170
<v Speaker 5>How did that bag?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He pulled a seven.</v>

1710
01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:47.630
<v Speaker 5>I got screwed because that's why you go</v>
<v Speaker 5>to Vegas.</v>

1711
01:22:47.631 --> 01:22:48.321
<v Speaker 5>I told them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1712
01:22:48.321 --> 01:22:51.320
<v Speaker 5>this is why come to vegas to lose money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1713
01:22:51.330 --> 01:22:51.960
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1714
01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:56.870
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you lose money and I had to tell</v>

1715

01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:17.800
<v Speaker 5>they're showing like if they're showing</v>
<v Speaker 5>a face card,</v>

1722
01:23:17.801 --> 01:23:18.820
<v Speaker 5>some people hit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:22.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm at 16.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said the wrong thing.</v>

1726
01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:26.590
<v Speaker 5>Like I always stay on 16.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if they're showing a face card,</v>

1727
01:23:26.591 --> 01:23:28.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm like I just stay on 16.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1728
01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:31.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm conservative but then I'll double</v>

1729
01:23:31.091 --> 01:23:32.480
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Double down.</v>

1730
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:34.510
<v Speaker 5>You have the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hit on 17.</v>

1731
01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:39.040
<v Speaker 5>That's those wild white people you were</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking to are the people we need you to</v>

1732
01:23:39.041 --> 01:23:42.580
<v Speaker 5>turn there listening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cowboys.</v>

1733
01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:44.170
<v Speaker 5>People listen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're listening.</v>

1734
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:45.183
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh.</v>

1735
01:23:45.210 --> 01:23:47.290
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess we probably should wrap this up.</v>

1736
01:23:47.291 --> 01:23:50.230
<v Speaker 5>Jessica,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell everybody what your um,</v>

1737
01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:53.790
<v Speaker 5>your twitter handle is [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's J.</v>

1738
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:55.130
<v Speaker 5>Rosenworcel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Spell my</v>

<v Speaker 5>r o s e n w o r c e l and m.</v>

1741
01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:10.060
<v Speaker 5>So your advice is people should do the</v>
<v Speaker 5>old fashioned thing.</v>

1742
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:14.800
<v Speaker 5>Make those phone calls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My advice is make a Ruckus make rocking</v>

1743
01:24:16.090 --> 01:24:19.690
<v Speaker 5>without a little noise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is one of those times and I think</v>

1744
01:24:19.691 --> 01:24:22.270
<v Speaker 5>being a citizen requires us all to speak</v>
<v Speaker 5>up right now.</v>

1745
01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:24.940
<v Speaker 5>Make a Ruckus online as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let people know.</v>

1746
01:24:24.941 --> 01:24:26.590
<v Speaker 5>And your social media,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your facebook,</v>

1747
01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:27.850
<v Speaker 5>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that jazz.</v>

1748
01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:31.690
<v Speaker 5>And getting the pornhub comments.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hashtag that neutrality.</v>

1749
01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:33.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not what she says.</v>

1750
01:24:33.491 --> 01:24:36.430
<v Speaker 5>What I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe you leave comments.</v>

1751
01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:38.950
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe I know somebody leaves</v>
<v Speaker 5>comments.</v>

1752
01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.070
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
