<v Speaker 1>We were at the store.</v>

92
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.933
<v Speaker 1>People would love him.</v>

93
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>He would.</v>

94
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>People come up to him at the store and they'll go,</v>

95
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>can I get a picture with you?</v>

<v Speaker 1>you want a picture with me?</v>

98
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Like he was like genuinely confused.</v>

99
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

100
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 1>He never figured it out.</v>

101
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:31.800
<v Speaker 1>He was a guy who needed someone to take care of them.</v>

102
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>You need a manager?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just get them booked.</v>

109
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

110
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>it's just like having him manage his career on his own.</v>

111
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Did he ever have a manager?</v>

118
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>

119
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.430

<v Speaker 1>And I'm being,</v>

126
00:02:56.251 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Goldman would call it London itis where you just get tired of Jay,</v>

133
00:03:05.211 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>It was fucked up because it was one of those cases where if somebody worked with</v>

<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.921
<v Speaker 1>I'll be over here.</v>

151
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:36.320
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

152
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.220
<v Speaker 1>move the microphone.</v>

153
00:03:37.221 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>When he went on a joke didn't go well.</v>

154
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.860
<v Speaker 1>He's the only guy I know who could honestly do the same joke twice in one set</v>

155
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>because he forgot and the crowd would laugh because everyone knew,</v>

156
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>like he honestly forgot.</v>

157
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:50.620
<v Speaker 1>He's already told that joke.</v>

158
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

159
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

161
00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.880
<v Speaker 1>but dude,</v>

162
00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

163
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 1>they've done a bunch of people now.</v>

164
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Bunch of UFC people have staggering results.</v>

165
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

166
00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:09.491
<v Speaker 1>You're saying Roy Nelson did his knee or Daniel cormier is knee stem cells.</v>

167
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Either of those guys at Ak.</v>

168
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.100
<v Speaker 2>I would just do every joint.</v>

169
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Even if there's no problem,</v>

170
00:04:15.231 --> 00:04:16.410
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like if you were the coach,</v>

173
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what Ludwig did.</v>

174
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.003
<v Speaker 1>Pretty applicable.</v>

175
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Preemptively got both shoulders done.</v>

176
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.000
<v Speaker 1>I think he did his hips too.</v>

177
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.461

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Like you beat the fuck out of yourself.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's horrible.</v>

194
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're holding mitts for some fucking John Jones.</v>

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well Jon Jones hits hard,</v>

197
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:49.300

198
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 2>like travis or Travis Browne,</v>

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 2>allister,</v>

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Especially allister when he was on this.</v>

202
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's true or not.</v>

203
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.233
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's true.</v>

204
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.710
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was proven</v>

205
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.100
<v Speaker 2>so dumb that drug shit fucking stupid.</v>

206
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.091
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

207
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 2>when I was in high school had to write a paper and the paper that I wrote was</v>

208
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:18.331
<v Speaker 2>that you should legalize every drug and and I was all the kind of thing,</v>

209
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:19.460
<v Speaker 2>a 13 year old,</v>

210
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

211
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I was all hyped up on,</v>

212
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

213
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 2>on Nwa Gangsta rap and I was like,</v>

214
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.090
<v Speaker 2>how in the fuck did easy Egan oozy?</v>

215
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Like he doesn't look like anybody that should have Uzi.</v>

216
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.570
<v Speaker 2>That's true is because he can sell and the black market is the only thing that</v>

217
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:35.201
<v Speaker 2>makes crime.</v>

218
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

219
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.950
<v Speaker 2>why do we have a black if they want to.</v>

220
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 2>But that's the thing is like everybody is all fucking excited about marijuana</v>

221
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:42.540
<v Speaker 2>being you all plots.</v>

222
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's a fucking pussy.</v>

223
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 2>You're out there like,</v>

224
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 2>oh look at wic and smoke a joint on CNN.</v>

225
00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:47.884
<v Speaker 2>Well guess what?</v>

226
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 2>You still got fucking 500,000 guys that are locked up.</v>

227
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:53.200
<v Speaker 2>You should be protesting that every fucking day of pop.</v>

228
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.570
<v Speaker 2>Really actually legal like in those states.</v>

229
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 2>They should just be letting dudes out by the fucking dozens every minute.</v>

230
00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.893
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>

231
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.530
<v Speaker 2>If you were in Colorado and you're in jail,</v>

232
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.661
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

233
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:03.650
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck?</v>

234
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

235
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 2>And then how many of those guys are in there?</v>

236
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.350
<v Speaker 2>And then they fucking catch a real case in there because now you've got to fight</v>

237
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.610
<v Speaker 2>or you're a a fuck.</v>

238
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 2>That's horrible.</v>

239
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 2>That does happen.</v>

240
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.801
<v Speaker 2>That does happen.</v>

241
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 2>All that shit should be legal.</v>

242
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that,</v>

243
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.291
<v Speaker 2>and people are like,</v>

244
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:18.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

245
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.720
<v Speaker 2>they just tax it.</v>

246
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's like they just tax to the government.</v>

247
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 2>But that's on the idea that the government gives a fuck the government.</v>

248
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.661
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

249
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:27.494
<v Speaker 2>it makes more money.</v>

250
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 2>It's not like if I can tax you who wants to buy weed?</v>

251
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 2>I wanted,</v>

252
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 2>how do I tax everybody?</v>

253
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 2>I make them all scared and then I am prison guys for this illegality.</v>

254
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.080
<v Speaker 2>And then I can get the public dollars because look,</v>

255
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.211
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

256
00:06:40.211 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it scary that we got these black and Mexican guys that are selling dope</v>

257
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 2>and we need to put them somewhere.</v>

258
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.900
<v Speaker 1>My stepdad and his,</v>

259
00:06:45.901 --> 00:06:46.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

260
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.440
<v Speaker 1>his um,</v>

261
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.090
<v Speaker 1>he had a business partner.</v>

262
00:06:49.091 --> 00:06:51.850
<v Speaker 1>And architectural firm and they beat each other up one day.</v>

263
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Should it be like he came home,</v>

264
00:06:53.951 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 1>he had a black eye and he was in his forties and I was a kid.</v>

265
00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.601
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

266
00:06:58.601 --> 00:06:58.751
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

267
00:06:58.751 --> 00:06:59.081
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

268
00:06:59.081 --> 00:06:59.914
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

269
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.780
<v Speaker 1>I was fighting back down to zero skills like this.</v>

270
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Like what did this fight look like between.</v>

271
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Because I knew as basic as that dead worse.</v>

272
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.780
<v Speaker 1>What is like he's a good guy,</v>

273
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.040
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad person.</v>

274
00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:13.630
<v Speaker 1>But I knew the guy fought with two.</v>

275
00:07:13.631 --> 00:07:13.841
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

276
00:07:13.841 --> 00:07:17.260
<v Speaker 1>that's even more ridiculous that that guy gave you a black eye because that has</v>

277
00:07:17.261 --> 00:07:17.861
<v Speaker 1>to be thinking.</v>

278
00:07:17.861 --> 00:07:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm mad though.</v>

279
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.110
<v Speaker 1>They missed so bad.</v>

280
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Well it was a very complicated situation where they had a government contracts</v>

281
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.200
<v Speaker 1>and then the government lost money.</v>

282
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Like there was like a,</v>

283
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.630
<v Speaker 1>there was a recession and during the recession they cancel a lot of their</v>

284
00:07:34.631 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 1>contracts.</v>

285
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.781
<v Speaker 1>So these guys,</v>

286
00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:40.090
<v Speaker 1>they put all this time and work and effort into these projects and the projects</v>

287
00:07:40.091 --> 00:07:44.080
<v Speaker 1>were pulled out from under them and all their investment was done super fucked.</v>

288
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.070
<v Speaker 1>It was really bad.</v>

289
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.150
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

290
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.983
<v Speaker 1>they all,</v>

291
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:51.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there was a lot of blame on both sides and who knows what the fuck</v>

292
00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:51.401
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
