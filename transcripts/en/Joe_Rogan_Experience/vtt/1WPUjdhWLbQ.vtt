00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Keep in mind that these narratives of Ford by public opinion,</v>

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:06.471
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

4
00:00:06.471 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 2>this isn't the studio is trying to make the public,</v>

5
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Speaker 2>force feed the public like gender roles and you know,</v>

7
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 2>whatever this is the public saying.</v>

8
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:15.001
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

9
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:15.781
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that.</v>

10
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 2>So the studios are responding to the questionnaires that these researchers give</v>

11
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:20.244
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

12
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 2>So one of the really interesting things,</v>

13
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 2>and this is totally inflammatory,</v>

14
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.600
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

15
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 2>the role of the person defending like physically,</v>

16
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 2>physically defending the community when they try to put a woman in that role,</v>

17
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 2>people have a problem with it.</v>

18
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.491
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

19
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

20
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 2>and frankly,</v>

21
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 2>often women have a problem with it.</v>

22
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.211
<v Speaker 2>Like it's real,</v>

23
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:39.751
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

24
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:40.584
<v Speaker 2>really interesting.</v>

25
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 2>And women are just as important as men in a crisis or in anything,</v>

26
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.323
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

27
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.081
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

28
00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 2>what the public seems to want is the guy with the sword and the woman with the</v>

29
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:51.174
<v Speaker 2>bandage,</v>

30
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.700
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

32
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

33
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 2>or with the sort of reassuring,</v>

34
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

35
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 2>like he gets divided like that and it's not,</v>

36
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:57.361
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

37
00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 2>it's not the studios forcing something on people.</v>

38
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Is it the people watching these films saying just voting on what they,</v>

39
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.310
<v Speaker 2>the narrative that they'd like best.</v>

40
00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:05.660
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

41
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 2>the other character that I thought was really hilarious,</v>

42
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.800
<v Speaker 2>there's often that there is eight,</v>

43
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 2>an estranged husband who's betrayed his wife and family in some way.</v>

44
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 2>He's on the outs,</v>

45
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.203
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

46
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

47
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

48
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 2>with his family and his,</v>

49
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:17.850
<v Speaker 2>with his wife.</v>

50
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:19.070
<v Speaker 2>And then the crisis happens.</v>

51
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 2>The martians invade the floodwaters rise,</v>

52
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:21.954
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

53
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 2>and he comes to the rescue and does the right thing and saves his wife and</v>

54
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 2>family and maybe even the wife's new boyfriend.</v>

55
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:29.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

56
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:29.741
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

57
00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Keven could have gotten to that stage,</v>

58
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:31.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

59
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 2>And because he does the right thing,</v>

60
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 2>she takes them back.</v>

61
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

62
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.221
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

63
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:38.461
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

64
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 2>It's really just playing out these ancient archetypes.</v>

65
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly what it's doing.</v>

66
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

67
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:43.480
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

68
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

69
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 2>those storylines resonate because they're ancient and because those,</v>

70
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 2>those roles in society helped us survive.</v>

71
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>And then it dawned on me,</v>

72
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:52.111
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

73
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Stamets you're in the tallest tree on the tallest hill for miles in the middle</v>

74
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>of a lightning storm.</v>

75
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>This is not the best place to be.</v>

76
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>And so I realize I could be killed up here.</v>

77
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly I had a reality rush.</v>

78
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

79
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.873
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

81
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>you could turn into a god.</v>

82
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Imagine Comics Kaia 20 grams of mushrooms hugging a tree.</v>

83
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:18.160
<v Speaker 1>The lightning comes and hits you and Paul,</v>

84
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>maybe you were the savior.</v>

85
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need to get back to that tree.</v>

86
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're the chosen one.</v>

87
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

88
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.851
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

89
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:27.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

91
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 1>it was an incredibly spiritual and wonderful experience,</v>

92
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:33.750
<v Speaker 1>but I also had the fear and just comes,</v>

93
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>comes with it.</v>

94
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>The Hero's journey,</v>

95
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:38.520
<v Speaker 1>you always have the dark side.</v>

97
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:39.211
<v Speaker 1>He always have,</v>

98
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 1>not just the light side,</v>

99
00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's counterbalanced with the dark side.</v>

100
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Then I realized,</v>

101
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.033
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

102
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna,</v>

103
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>I could die up here.</v>

104
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

105
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

106
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.861
<v Speaker 1>I don't die.</v>

107
00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Stamets which,</v>

108
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>where are your issues?</v>

109
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

110
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>this gets something out of this experience.</v>

111
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.973
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

112
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.790
<v Speaker 1>this stuttering habit is ridiculous and I,</v>

113
00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not stupid.</v>

114
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.961
<v Speaker 1>And I saw,</v>

115
00:02:57.961 --> 00:02:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I said to myself,</v>

116
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>stop stuttering now.</v>

117
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Stop Stuttering now.</v>

118
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>I said that dozens,</v>

119
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of times over and over and over.</v>

120
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:11.641
<v Speaker 1>And fortunately the storms went past and held onto the tree and soaking wet.</v>

121
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 1>I came out of the tree and lock back to where I was living.</v>

122
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>And then the next day I got up,</v>

123
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see anybody and I was walking along on this path and a sidewalk and</v>

124
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a lady that I really liked a lot.</v>

125
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.793
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

126
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 1>but she was always attracted to the super self assured jocks and things like</v>

127
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:30.341
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

128
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>She was actually very kind and sweet,</v>

129
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't want to stare at her in the eyes because I would stutter.</v>

130
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>And it's humiliating for us.</v>

131
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 1>So the more humiliating us stutterers feel,</v>

132
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>the more we stutter.</v>

133
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a really slippery slope.</v>

134
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>And so I would avoid eye contact.</v>

135
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>And so for the first time she walked towards him,</v>

136
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:53.230
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

137
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.921
<v Speaker 1>Good Morning Paul,</v>

138
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:54.431
<v Speaker 1>how are you?</v>

139
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 1>She was always so nice to me and I was terrified because I'd embarrass myself.</v>

140
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at her straight in the eyes and I said,</v>

141
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.121
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing fine.</v>

142
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:01.954
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>

143
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.240
<v Speaker 1>And I stopped stuttering in one day.</v>

144
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

145
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>And this speaks to now what was been medically proven is that we can reset the</v>

146
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>neurology of the human brain through neurogenesis.</v>

147
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is a real no bullshit achievable time for you at full</v>

148
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 3>marathon?</v>

149
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.293
<v Speaker 3>Full Marathon.</v>

150
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.111
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

151
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:20.681
<v Speaker 3>you got to help me.</v>

152
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 3>You run for 45 to a little over two.</v>

153
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 3>It'd be a pretty good full marathons,</v>

154
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.763
<v Speaker 3>full nights.</v>

155
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Five fives as it got five has to be a good mark because after that three hour</v>

156
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 3>mark or even doing the half,</v>

157
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 3>you're going to hit a real tough wall,</v>

158
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 3>but you also will be running with a pace group the whole time,</v>

159
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:40.500
<v Speaker 3>which helps and I'll do anything.</v>

160
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 3>I have to go with them no matter what.</v>

161
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 3>I have to go with that.</v>

162
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 3>Five hours,</v>

163
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 3>five hours.</v>

164
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.141
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

165
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what I'm saying.</v>

166
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about draining my bank account to bet you hold on Joe.</v>

167
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Five hours.</v>

168
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 3>What are we doing here?</v>

169

<v Speaker 3>I like this like do you think he could do it for five hours?</v>

179
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:13.200

180
00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:14.040
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I want to,</v>

181
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.230

184
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.503

190
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.420
<v Speaker 3>I think you could do it.</v>

191
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you couldn't do it.</v>

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.020
<v Speaker 4>what city are they going to be in?</v>

200
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.871
<v Speaker 4>San Diego,</v>

201
00:05:41.871 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 4>La [inaudible]</v>

202
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

203
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.710
<v Speaker 3>do you know the story of Viagara and how that was developed was,</v>

204
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

205
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.170
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a blood pressure medication,</v>

206
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:52.650
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

207
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.190
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

208
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.640
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

209
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

210
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 3>so they found like,</v>

211
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.551
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

212
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 3>this isn't working very well for what we designed it for,</v>

213
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

214
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 3>but it's got some pretty interesting effects.</v>

215
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:05.480
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

216
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 3>but they knew it wasn't enough to just then go out there and start selling it</v>

217
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 3>for two guys to say,</v>

218
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:11.234
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

219
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 3>here's a drug that will help make you perform better.</v>

220
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.790
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

221
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 3>Bedroom.</v>

222
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't enough.</v>

223
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.760
<v Speaker 3>What they had to do was create a disease that it could be prescribed for because</v>

224
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

225
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

226
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 3>and then you know how they did that,</v>

227
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.480
<v Speaker 3>they hired an advertising agency and the ad agency came up with the term</v>

228
00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 3>erectile dysfunction.</v>

229
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

230
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 3>And created this.</v>

231
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

232
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.191
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

233
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 3>It's publicly available information named a disease.</v>

234
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.450
<v Speaker 3>This is not the only case where this has happened.</v>

235
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Speaker 3>So they create this disease category and then they'd get it out into the world</v>

236
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 3>and they advertise it to people and to doctors and so all of a sudden people are</v>

237
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:52.430
<v Speaker 3>going in with the magazine.</v>

238
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:53.264
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

239
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.523
<v Speaker 3>this is me.</v>

240
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 3>I have erectile dysfunction.</v>

241
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 3>And I know now there's a drug called Viagara that I need because I have erectile</v>

242
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:02.871
<v Speaker 3>dysfunction.</v>

243
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 3>And the doctor has seen the,</v>

244
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.160
<v Speaker 3>they have their own brochure.</v>

245
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

246
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 3>They pull out their brochure and it says erectile dysfunction.</v>

247
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 3>Here are the signs and symptoms.</v>

248
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:09.291
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

249
00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:09.591

250
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:09.831

251
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:10.041

00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:10.611
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

254
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:12.440
<v Speaker 3>This patient's got erectile Ed.</v>

255
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.333
<v Speaker 3>So here's the drug.</v>

256
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

257
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:19.130
<v Speaker 3>is it legal for an advertising agency to name a disorder?</v>

258
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

259
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.900
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you that it's illegal in every single country in the world except for</v>

260
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:28.040
<v Speaker 3>New Zealand and the United States to advertise drugs to consumers.</v>

261
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.080
<v Speaker 3>Please New Zealand be the first strange.</v>

262
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 3>Please turn around,</v>

263
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 3>make us look terrible at first because this is the,</v>

264
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.110
<v Speaker 3>this is the result.</v>

265
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.190
<v Speaker 3>This is the result of allowing drugs to be advertised is that you get</v>

266
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 3>advertising agencies creating conditions that then required drugs to be treated.</v>

267
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:45.301
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>

268
00:07:45.301 --> 00:07:45.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

269

270
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

271
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.380
<v Speaker 2>look at Dennis this size compared to Shaq.</v>

272

277
00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.370
<v Speaker 2>Especially Shaq in his prime there.</v>

278
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.300

314
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:39.210
<v Speaker 2>when you see a buddy you really love and it's really affectionate and Dennis is</v>

315
00:08:39.211 --> 00:08:41.700
<v Speaker 2>one of those people at some point he just gets up and he wanders away.</v>

316
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:43.710
<v Speaker 2>I think he's going to take a piss.</v>

317
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

318
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.450
<v Speaker 2>About 10 minutes goes by,</v>

319
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:46.770
<v Speaker 2>I say to the waitress.</v>

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.360
<v Speaker 2>It's just the way he is.</v>

326
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

327
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.593
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't even say goodbye.</v>

328
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.483
<v Speaker 2>Just gone.</v>

329
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.870
<v Speaker 2>I get up the next morning,</v>

330
00:08:54.871 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 2>I the television,</v>

331
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Dennis Rodman's in North Korea.</v>

332
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.333
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

333
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.910

335
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I spend an hour and a half with them.</v>

336
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:03.151
<v Speaker 2>He didn't say anything.</v>

337
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:04.170
<v Speaker 2>We go about going to North Korea,</v>

338
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

339
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 2>So I turn on the television,</v>

340
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like very controversial.</v>

341
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 2>Dennis Rodman's in North Korea.</v>

342
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.970
<v Speaker 2>So I text my buddy and I say,</v>

343
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 2>have you seen the news?</v>

344
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.091
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

345
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:15.924
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

346
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

347
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 2>turn on the television.</v>

348
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:18.121
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

349
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:18.661
<v Speaker 2>what channel?</v>

350
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:18.961
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

351
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

352
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.950
<v Speaker 2>And two minutes goes by,</v>

353
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.000
<v Speaker 2>Holy Fuck.</v>

354
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 2>Because he went through the same thing,</v>

355
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:26.814
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

356
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:36.900
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
