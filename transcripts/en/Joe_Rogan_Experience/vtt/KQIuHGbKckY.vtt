1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening buddy?</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for coming to border.</v>

3
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other way around.</v>

4
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.293
<v Speaker 1>You're on the short list of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks consider a rational person that's </v>

5
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>running for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in a very strange time.</v>

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Would you agree?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're in the strangest time,</v>

7
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Evers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe in the history of politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly in my lifetime.</v>

9
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to make a lot of,</v>

10
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.763
<v Speaker 1>it almost seems like this is the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>gasp of the idea of running for </v>

11
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

12
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.070
<v Speaker 1>when you just do the mathematics of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that,</v>

13
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:34.904
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary and Donald Trump are arguably </v>

14
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>the two most polarizing figures in </v>
<v Speaker 1>American politics today,</v>

15
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>that trump has to go out and get 30% of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the far right to get the nomination.</v>

16
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.044
<v Speaker 1>Hillary has to go out and get 30% of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>far left when 50% of my of Americans </v>

17
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>right now who are registering to vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>are independent at the end of the day.</v>

18
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.883
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two major parties represent about </v>

19
00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>30% of the electorate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so where is,</v>

20
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.023
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the interests is the </v>

21
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>representation for the majority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in America?</v>

22
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the libertarian party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's libertarian.</v>

23
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just don't know it.</v>

24
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920
<v Speaker 1>And speaking with a broad brushstroke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian,</v>

25
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>fiscally conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially liberal.</v>

26
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be where most people hang </v>

27
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:23.394
<v Speaker 1>their hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not something that most people </v>

28
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 1>identify with when they talk about their</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual political persuasion.</v>

29
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.090
<v Speaker 1>They usually say there on the left or </v>
<v Speaker 1>right there on the right when you,</v>

30
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>someone says they're a libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that dude at the office.</v>

31
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>It has guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

32
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

33
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>The what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dude at the office,</v>

34
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:43.160
<v Speaker 1>the crazy dude at the office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

35
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we hit this,</v>

36
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 1>we w w we hit the streets the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York,</v>

37
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.010
<v Speaker 1>a film crew and asked 40 people what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian was and it was zero.</v>

38
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.570
<v Speaker 1>No one knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knew.</v>

39
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.121
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

41
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:57.954
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand the crazy guy with the </v>

42
00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part,</v>

43
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:03.130
<v Speaker 1>libertarian is just undefined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

44
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.073
<v Speaker 1>nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying there's anything wrong </v>

45
00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:06.264
<v Speaker 1>with being a libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying when you think about </v>

46
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:08.604
<v Speaker 1>libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the guy who is fed up and is like </v>

47
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.613
<v Speaker 1>sort of on the fringes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be with a lot of people </v>

48
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>associate with being a libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

49
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.083
<v Speaker 1>and I carry that a little bit further </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say that the baggage that the </v>

50
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians Carrie is survival of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fittest.</v>

51
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.963
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion that you're about no </v>

52
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:30.730
<v Speaker 1>government whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to die in the streets.</v>

53
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.160
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no governor.</v>

54
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

55
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>that is a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's almost like everyone knows that</v>

56
00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:41.094
<v Speaker 1>the two party system is kind of stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone seems to think that any </v>

57
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:45.774
<v Speaker 1>other party other than the two party </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is unrealistic or any other </v>

58
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:50.900
<v Speaker 1>party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Libertarian Green party somewhere</v>

59
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>along anything independent is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unrealistic.</v>

60
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.113
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.963
<v Speaker 1>I'm back to right now 50% of all people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are registering to vote or are </v>

62
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>registering</v>

63
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 2>as independent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Statistically right now,</v>

64
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:07.801
<v Speaker 2>43% of America is independent but new </v>
<v Speaker 2>registrations,</v>

65
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 2>50%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't,</v>

66
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know as the,</v>

67
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 2>as people do identify with the two </v>
<v Speaker 2>parties,</v>

68
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:14.734
<v Speaker 2>the rigged game of the system is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we're only presented with two </v>

69
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:18.484
<v Speaker 2>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that really starts with just being </v>

70
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 2>in the polls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look right now,</v>

71
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 2>if Mickey Mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the third name in any poll,</v>

72
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:31.051
<v Speaker 2>Mickey would be pulling it 30%,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Mickey's not on the ballot in all 50</v>

73
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I'm the libertarian nominee and I</v>

74
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 2>hope to be the libertarian nominee that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens next weekend,</v>

75
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be the only other candidate</v>

76
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 2>on the ballot in all 50 states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So polling,</v>

77
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to beat in the polls.</v>

78
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.873
<v Speaker 2>There is no way a third party wins </v>
<v Speaker 2>without being in the presidential </v>

79
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 2>debates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just not going to happen.</v>

80
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 2>The superbowl of politics to get in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidential debates,</v>

81
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 2>you have to be at 15% in the polls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

82
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 2>The rig game is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you're not in the polls,</v>

83
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.960
<v Speaker 2>there's no way that you can pull at 15%,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has to be a consistent polling.</v>

84
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting now.</v>

85
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 2>I was in the first national poll that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been in a month ago.</v>

86
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been in a national poll since,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a month,</v>

87
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 2>a month ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at 11% against Hillary and trump.</v>

88
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.003
<v Speaker 2>And was this all established back when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ross Perot sort of shook up the </v>

89
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:34.780
<v Speaker 2>political establishment because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lower percentage required to</v>

90
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 2>get involved in debates before that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

91
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 2>well actually there was no percentage </v>
<v Speaker 2>points prior to Ross Perot.</v>

92
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 2>That was something that got established </v>
<v Speaker 2>after Ross Perot.</v>

93
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:45.514
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is amazing to me is Ross Perot </v>

94
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.010
<v Speaker 2>after having gotten 19% of the general </v>
<v Speaker 2>election vote the first time,</v>

95
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.263
<v Speaker 2>the second time he ran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did not allow him in the </v>

96
00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 2>presidential debates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just,</v>

97
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the rigged nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

98
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 2>The rig nature of the game is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is come this fall,</v>

99
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 2>if my name does not appear in another </v>
<v Speaker 2>single pole,</v>

100
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 2>the presidential debate commission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll say a Gary Johnson.</v>

101
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:14.910
<v Speaker 2>He just didn't pull high enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they've,</v>

102
00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:15.744
<v Speaker 2>what they won't say is that he wasn't in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the polls and the Commission for </v>

103
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 2>presidents of the basis of privately </v>
<v Speaker 2>funded institution,</v>

104
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.353
<v Speaker 2>private Democrats and Republicans were </v>
<v Speaker 2>suing the presidential debate </v>

105
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 2>commission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

106
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think that it's a antitrust,</v>

107
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 2>we think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

108
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.663
<v Speaker 2>not think it's Democrats and Republicans</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they collude with one another to </v>

109
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:35.644
<v Speaker 2>exclude everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bruce Fein is suing the presidential </v>

110
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:39.934
<v Speaker 2>debate commission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bruce finds claim to fame is that he </v>

111
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:45.550
<v Speaker 2>brought Nixon down in Watergate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the next sentence,</v>

112
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:46.384
<v Speaker 2>he will tell you that the biggest thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's ever done in his life is suing the </v>

113
00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:49.624
<v Speaker 2>presidential debate commission because </v>
<v Speaker 2>this has the opportunity of changing </v>

114
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 2>politics in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

115
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 2>this is really at the heart of this rig </v>
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

116
00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 2>You can't</v>

117
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>win the presidency if you're not in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>super bowl of politics.</v>

118
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:02.714
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we figured the dollar value alone of </v>

119
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 1>being in the presidential debates is </v>
<v Speaker 1>several hundred million dollars.</v>

120
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Just think of the Super Bowl and the ads</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sell during the super bowl.</v>

121
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:17.471
<v Speaker 1>And imagine being a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having our second biggest audience.</v>

122
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't have like 75 million people </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

123
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 minutes,</v>

124
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 1>two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

125
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>that's a couple of hundred million </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars worth of advertising.</v>

126
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the show.</v>

127
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.540
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not in the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't consider your vote like it.</v>

128
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:32.374
<v Speaker 1>They think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you have 50% of these people </v>

129
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>that are registering and saying they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent,</v>

130
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.180
<v Speaker 1>what they're really saying is they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not committing to a left or a right.</v>

131
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:40.310
<v Speaker 1>They're not committing to a democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican,</v>

132
00:06:40.311 --> 00:06:43.850
<v Speaker 1>but are they gonna vote independent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of people.</v>

133
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 1>They have this idea that if you vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent,</v>

134
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 1>you're throwing away your vote.</v>

135
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.963
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a stigma that has to be </v>

136
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

137
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.821
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

138
00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:51.100
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

139
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

140
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:55.550
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for those people that they do vote,</v>

141
00:06:55.551 --> 00:06:57.710
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they ended up voting on the basis of</v>

142
00:06:57.711 --> 00:06:58.544
<v Speaker 1>the lesser of two evils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but since they're registering to vote </v>

143
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:03.950
<v Speaker 1>and they're registering to vote as </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent,</v>

144
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 1>they end up at the polls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

145
00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:07.460
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most pick,</v>

146
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>most people don't even go to the polls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't even vote.</v>

147
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

148
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 1>is there a way to fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that there's a way to maybe</v>

149
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.160
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another allow people to vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>online and change the way it's set up?</v>

150
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:19.994
<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to physically go to a </v>

151
00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:21.464
<v Speaker 1>location.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to sign up physically in </v>

152
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 1>a place that you can actually just do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>from your computer the same way we bank.</v>

153
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.190
<v Speaker 1>That has to be the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

154
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.840
<v Speaker 1>that does not exist now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that has to be the future.</v>

155
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.960
<v Speaker 1>And from a legislative standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>

156
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.510
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're president of the United States or</v>

157
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:44.900
<v Speaker 1>governor of New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could sign legislation that,</v>

158
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:45.731
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

159
00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 1>and these are the things that are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>

160
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.820
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be easier and easier to </v>
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>

161
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:50.654
<v Speaker 1>And that's what should be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which should be the case if the system </v>

162
00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:54.164
<v Speaker 1>isn't totally rick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause the problem is people like </v>

163
00:07:56.361 --> 00:07:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

164
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.240
<v Speaker 1>the people that are long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>established,</v>

165
00:08:00.241 --> 00:08:01.940
<v Speaker 1>when people that had been a part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics forever,</v>

166
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:02.803
<v Speaker 1>the last thing they want to do is turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the reins to the Internet because </v>

167
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.850
<v Speaker 1>she's had what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much they send.</v>

168
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:08.773
<v Speaker 1>They say they were spending spending </v>
<v Speaker 1>over a million dollars just to combat </v>

169
00:08:11.361 --> 00:08:15.830
<v Speaker 1>online trolls just to go on reddit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forums and correct people.</v>

170
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would,</v>

171
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.250
<v Speaker 1>I would be surprised if the number was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that low.</v>

172
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.070
<v Speaker 1>I would be surprised too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

173
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I think they're probably being pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative about that,</v>

174
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:28.721
<v Speaker 1>but the idea is that the internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't like the establishment.</v>

175
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.920
<v Speaker 1>They know that there's a real problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the system,</v>

176
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.530
<v Speaker 1>the system in place as is and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

177
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:37.700
<v Speaker 1>When I say the Internet of the broad </v>
<v Speaker 1>stroke that you're painting is obviously</v>

178
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:38.743
<v Speaker 1>young people who are a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of how screwy this whole system </v>

179
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:47.090
<v Speaker 1>that they're sort of born into is and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the people that are in charge don't</v>

180
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:49.220
<v Speaker 1>want to change it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to keep it a two party system.</v>

181
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.860
<v Speaker 1>They want to keep this silly white hat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black hat,</v>

182
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>goofy game going on forever and keep of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the power</v>

183
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.743
<v Speaker 3>right on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this cycle for the first time in my </v>

184
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 3>lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this might change.</v>

185
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean this because of just how </v>
<v Speaker 3>polarizing the two of them are.</v>

186
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.053
<v Speaker 3>And I think Bernie Sanders is what a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people think of as the alternative </v>

187
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:14.190
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mainstream alternative.</v>

188
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.920
<v Speaker 3>And he stands pretty far out there from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other guys.</v>

189
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.360
<v Speaker 3>So have you seen the website I side </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.com you gotta write it down.</v>

190
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:22.194
<v Speaker 3>You've got to take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take this political quiz I side and </v>

191
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:26.220
<v Speaker 3>everybody listening take this political </v>
<v Speaker 3>quiz.</v>

192
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 3>I side with the com,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about 60 questions.</v>

193
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:31.800
<v Speaker 3>It's really easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to,</v>

194
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

195
00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to sign up on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>website,</v>

196
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:35.154
<v Speaker 3>but you take this quiz and at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the quiz you get paired up with a </v>

197
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:40.350
<v Speaker 3>presidential candidate most in line with</v>
<v Speaker 3>your views.</v>

198
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:41.184
<v Speaker 3>It just makes real sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think everybody should take the quiz </v>

199
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:46.550
<v Speaker 3>and whoever you line up with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

200
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 3>I think you should knock yourself out </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporting that person.</v>

201
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:50.611
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

202
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:53.520
<v Speaker 3>taking the I side with quiz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazingly,</v>

203
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:54.354
<v Speaker 3>the next politician that I aligned with </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of the libertarians that are </v>

204
00:09:57.241 --> 00:10:00.230
<v Speaker 3>running for president is Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

205
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 3>I aligned with Bernie Sanders 73% of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what he says.</v>

206
00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:06.570
<v Speaker 3>Now when it comes to economics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we come to a t in the road,</v>

207
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to the socialism versus,</v>

208
00:10:09.661 --> 00:10:10.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

209
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:15.360
<v Speaker 3>being an entrepreneur when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>big government versus small government,</v>

210
00:10:15.361 --> 00:10:17.250
<v Speaker 3>we come to that t in the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

211
00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:20.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the issues of legalizing marijuana,</v>

212
00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:23.310
<v Speaker 3>same sex marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a woman's right to choose,</v>

213
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:24.144
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's stop with these military </v>

214
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:27.930
<v Speaker 3>interventions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just,</v>

215
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.420
<v Speaker 3>this is just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in line.</v>

216
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

217
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pushed this website because,</v>

218
00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:37.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should work the other way around.</v>

219
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I side with Bernie most of the time,</v>

220
00:10:39.841 --> 00:10:43.440
<v Speaker 3>but oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the libertarian candidate,</v>

221
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.303
<v Speaker 3>Gary Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I side with next in line and I do </v>

222
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:48.540
<v Speaker 3>believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

223
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.580
<v Speaker 3>Bernie is not going to get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nomination.</v>

224
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And where do all those voters go?</v>

225
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.750
<v Speaker 3>Where does 50% of Republicans go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That really are at the end of the day.</v>

226
00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:01.434
<v Speaker 3>And I was socially tolerant and fiscally</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative and I think that is the </v>

227
00:11:05.251 --> 00:11:07.560
<v Speaker 3>majority of Republican voters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

228
00:11:07.561 --> 00:11:08.394
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been co opted by the social </v>

229
00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:11.484
<v Speaker 3>conservatives that have an agenda that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think is really a turnoff to most of </v>

230
00:11:15.781 --> 00:11:16.614
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's okay to be a social </v>

231
00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:18.624
<v Speaker 3>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with being a </v>

232
00:11:19.381 --> 00:11:20.970
<v Speaker 3>social conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you,</v>

233
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.900
<v Speaker 3>if you equate or if you make that public</v>
<v Speaker 3>policy,</v>

234
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 3>if you pass laws regarding social </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatism,</v>

235
00:11:28.141 --> 00:11:31.110
<v Speaker 3>you end up putting people in jail for </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal choices.</v>

236
00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:35.730
<v Speaker 3>And we do have the highest incarceration</v>
<v Speaker 3>rate of any country in the world.</v>

237
00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 3>And I think that starts with the drug </v>
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>

238
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.480
<v Speaker 3>The word conservative is interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

239
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:40.314
<v Speaker 3>when you apply it to social issues like </v>
<v Speaker 3>social conservativism cause </v>

240
00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:43.464
<v Speaker 3>conservatives really wa the original </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives were stay out of my </v>

241
00:11:46.741 --> 00:11:48.180
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll stay out of yours.</v>

242
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.193
<v Speaker 3>So social conservative really wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>apply to like things along the of gay </v>

243
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:54.430
<v Speaker 3>marriage</v>

244
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.100
<v Speaker 4>or same sex unions or anything along </v>
<v Speaker 4>those lines.</v>

245
00:11:57.101 --> 00:11:57.934
<v Speaker 4>You would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd say we'll leave those people </v>

246
00:11:58.631 --> 00:11:59.464
<v Speaker 4>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be the conservative approach </v>

247
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 4>that government should stay out of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>people's lives.</v>

248
00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:03.500
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

249
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it started out as classical liberal.</v>

250
00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Classical liberal is being fiscally </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative and socially liberal,</v>

251
00:12:11.271 --> 00:12:13.700
<v Speaker 2>which got co-opted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

252
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.540
<v Speaker 2>that used to be what a conservative was </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that got co opted.</v>

253
00:12:17.541 --> 00:12:18.410
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

254
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.200
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're a little bit of both.</v>

255
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.890
<v Speaker 2>You've heard the old adage that if in </v>
<v Speaker 2>college you weren't a Democrat,</v>

256
00:12:24.891 --> 00:12:27.710
<v Speaker 2>you didn't have a heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if a,</v>

257
00:12:27.711 --> 00:12:29.810
<v Speaker 2>as an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't a Republican,</v>

258
00:12:29.811 --> 00:12:31.280
<v Speaker 2>you didn't have a brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

259
00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.180
<v Speaker 2>I think we've got both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of us have got both of those things.</v>

260
00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.313
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just real polarizing to have only </v>

261
00:12:38.071 --> 00:12:38.904
<v Speaker 4>two choices.</v>

262
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

263
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.400
<v Speaker 2>and it's so polarizing because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those issues,</v>

264
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:43.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

265
00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:45.430
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

266
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:46.623
<v Speaker 2>why can't Democrats and Republicans come</v>
<v Speaker 2>together on some very common sense </v>

267
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:52.750
<v Speaker 2>issues that would move the country </v>
<v Speaker 2>before</v>

268
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.840
<v Speaker 4>ward?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

269
00:12:53.841 --> 00:12:56.570
<v Speaker 4>decades ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the term libertarian was very,</v>

270
00:12:56.571 --> 00:12:59.330
<v Speaker 4>very rarely used.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When was it invented?</v>

271
00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.220
<v Speaker 4>And I think we would all agree that it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least something discussed today.</v>

272
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.370
<v Speaker 2>So 71 is when the libertarian party was </v>
<v Speaker 2>established.</v>

273
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:11.960
<v Speaker 2>And I remember in [inaudible] 71 and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

274
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:13.623
<v Speaker 2>I graduated from high school in </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 71 and I remember getting a </v>

275
00:13:17.261 --> 00:13:19.930
<v Speaker 2>book that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what it is to be a libertarian.</v>

276
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.110
<v Speaker 2>And it was a very short read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

277
00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:24.640
<v Speaker 2>read the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

278
00:13:24.641 --> 00:13:26.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly I was a libertarian.</v>

279
00:13:26.711 --> 00:13:27.544
<v Speaker 2>I've identified myself as a libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>since now have I registered as a </v>

280
00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:32.110
<v Speaker 2>libertarian?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

281
00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:35.500
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but back to the book or read the book,</v>

282
00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 2>it said pass the book on as I had had it</v>
<v Speaker 2>passed on to me and for me,</v>

283
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.133
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've identified myself as such since I </v>

284
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:46.060
<v Speaker 2>think it's very typical that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

285
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.020
<v Speaker 2>well in New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember in the eighties,</v>

286
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.520
<v Speaker 2>early eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a congressional debate,</v>

287
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.383
<v Speaker 2>Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat and the Libertarian and the </v>

288
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:59.110
<v Speaker 2>discussion in the bar afterwards when </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like this who won the debate,</v>

289
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.063
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just this overall consensus was </v>

290
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.810
<v Speaker 2>the libertarian won the debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who are we going to vote for?</v>

291
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.930
<v Speaker 2>Because the libertarian never wins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

292
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:07.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

293
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.460
<v Speaker 2>That's the real rub,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

294
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:11.080
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing your vote away,</v>

295
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:16.710
<v Speaker 2>throwing your vote away and how can you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

296
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:17.603
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing your vote away is voting for </v>

297
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:21.700
<v Speaker 2>somebody that you don't believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's throwing your vote away.</v>

298
00:14:21.701 --> 00:14:25.330
<v Speaker 2>You vote for somebody you believe in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you change the system.</v>

299
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:26.623
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really become a stigma that has to </v>

300
00:14:28.551 --> 00:14:31.530
<v Speaker 4>somehow or another be removed publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

301
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:36.530
<v Speaker 4>I just keep thinking that with each one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of these fiasco elections,</v>

302
00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:41.680
<v Speaker 4>that this idea of a third party will </v>
<v Speaker 4>slowly but surely emerge and it seems to</v>

303
00:14:42.411 --> 00:14:43.730
<v Speaker 4>be gaining ground</v>

304
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.320
<v Speaker 2>and it could be this cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so far,</v>

305
00:14:46.321 --> 00:14:48.150
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it hasn't had what happened.</v>

306
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's the TV,</v>

307
00:14:49.711 --> 00:14:51.290
<v Speaker 4>it's the TV thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

308
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.143
<v Speaker 4>I those</v>

309
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.170
<v Speaker 3>debates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so bizarre.</v>

310
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.033
<v Speaker 3>It's such a strange show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or one person says something and the </v>

311
00:14:57.771 --> 00:14:58.604
<v Speaker 3>other person standing there shaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>their head and not agreeing and then </v>

312
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:04.640
<v Speaker 3>they enter jacked or they go over their </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and the other person jumps in.</v>

313
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.050
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the worst ways ever to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>your point across and,</v>

314
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.540
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree,</v>

315
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.880
<v Speaker 3>but if you're not in those debates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

316
00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:16.850
<v Speaker 3>you were a non entity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have no chance.</v>

317
00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

318
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a seal of approval if you will.</v>

319
00:15:20.601 --> 00:15:24.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a seal of credibility that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the stage in the first place.</v>

320
00:15:24.351 --> 00:15:26.360
<v Speaker 3>And if you're not on the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a chance.</v>

321
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.120
<v Speaker 3>So a lot is riding on this Bruce Fein </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawsuit,</v>

322
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.350
<v Speaker 3>you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

323
00:15:30.351 --> 00:15:31.184
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what everything is riding on for me is </v>

324
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:38.840
<v Speaker 3>being in the polls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I am in the national polls,</v>

325
00:15:38.841 --> 00:15:43.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm back to the Mickey analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Mickey's not on the ballot in all 50</v>

326
00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:43.850
<v Speaker 3>states.</v>

327
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:44.683
<v Speaker 3>So the justification of having me in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>polls is it then I am on the ballot in </v>

328
00:15:48.021 --> 00:15:48.854
<v Speaker 3>all 50 states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I really do think that I represent </v>

329
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:51.884
<v Speaker 3>the majority of Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm offering up proof of that with this </v>

330
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:57.290
<v Speaker 3>ice side website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People say to me,</v>

331
00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.670
<v Speaker 3>why should I vote for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

332
00:15:58.671 --> 00:16:01.730
<v Speaker 3>how about about getting online and </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing where you're,</v>

333
00:16:01.731 --> 00:16:05.450
<v Speaker 3>where you are at philosophically with </v>
<v Speaker 3>those people running for president.</v>

334
00:16:05.451 --> 00:16:06.284
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you owe it to yourself to find </v>

335
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:09.284
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

336
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 3>who lines up with what it is that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in?</v>

337
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.270
<v Speaker 3>That's a rational approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very rational approach and people</v>

338
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:20.600
<v Speaker 3>owe it to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just fascinating that we look,</v>

339
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.200
<v Speaker 3>nobody really knew who Bernie Sanders </v>
<v Speaker 3>was until this election.</v>

340
00:16:24.201 --> 00:16:25.880
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't something that was in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>public eye.</v>

341
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you knew about him,</v>

342
00:16:27.201 --> 00:16:28.034
<v Speaker 3>he knew of him as a senator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one knew a lot about him until </v>

343
00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:32.444
<v Speaker 3>this cycle.</v>

344
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.160
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you,</v>

345
00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:36.560
<v Speaker 3>when you go down the litany of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>

346
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:37.540
<v Speaker 3>like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

347
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.613
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with the guy three quarters of </v>

348
00:16:40.281 --> 00:16:42.730
<v Speaker 3>what he has to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying to the exit,</v>

349
00:16:42.731 --> 00:16:44.430
<v Speaker 3>to the point of a economics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

350
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.510
<v Speaker 3>that's the real proof that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>locked up system.</v>

351
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.110
<v Speaker 3>Because if you were in those debates </v>
<v Speaker 3>with all those people,</v>

352
00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:51.944
<v Speaker 3>and during the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most likely a lot of people would be </v>

353
00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:55.640
<v Speaker 3>looking at you and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

354
00:16:55.641 --> 00:16:58.220
<v Speaker 3>this Gary Johnson guy makes a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

355
00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:59.483
<v Speaker 3>And what you point out is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is absolutely correct in that every </v>

356
00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:06.560
<v Speaker 3>single republican on stage was a social </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative.</v>

357
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.130
<v Speaker 3>And when it comes to the Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

358
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.370
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well both parties are well intentioned,</v>

359
00:17:13.371 --> 00:17:15.230
<v Speaker 3>but when it comes to Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

360
00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:16.064
<v Speaker 3>they do grow government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I really believe that a bigger </v>

361
00:17:19.191 --> 00:17:21.590
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although it's well intentioned,</v>

362
00:17:21.591 --> 00:17:25.700
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes tax money out of my pocket that</v>

363
00:17:25.701 --> 00:17:26.534
<v Speaker 3>I could be spending on my life as </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed to the government spending that </v>

364
00:17:29.241 --> 00:17:29.930
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

365
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.220
<v Speaker 3>Ideally you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

366
00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:32.054
<v Speaker 3>you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd take your money and you'd be able </v>

367
00:17:33.231 --> 00:17:35.560
<v Speaker 3>to donate it to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just exactly where,</v>

368
00:17:35.561 --> 00:17:38.390
<v Speaker 3>where you wanted that money to be spent </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideally.</v>

369
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.640
<v Speaker 3>And I realized that that's not practical</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all,</v>

370
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:41.683
<v Speaker 3>but that's a really good point that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that the larger the government </v>

371
00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:44.234
<v Speaker 3>gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more money it cost to keep that </v>

372
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.273
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that it's going to do </v>

373
00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:49.130
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's going to do more,</v>

374
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.720
<v Speaker 3>there's more government is more people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more programs,</v>

375
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:54.300
<v Speaker 3>but they cost more money and then then </v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

376
00:17:54.301 --> 00:17:56.250
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a point of diminishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>returns.</v>

377
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Speaker 3>And at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>statistically it doesn't help.</v>

378
00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:00.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

379
00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.770
<v Speaker 3>and that isn't to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

380
00:18:01.771 --> 00:18:05.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the camp that believes that there</v>
<v Speaker 3>are those people that are truly in need,</v>

381
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.980
<v Speaker 3>but I think we've gone way over the line</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to people in need.</v>

382
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.413
<v Speaker 3>And at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we continue the growth of government </v>

383
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:18.360
<v Speaker 3>and taxation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

384
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.540
<v Speaker 3>at the end and printing money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the day,</v>

385
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:25.200
<v Speaker 3>we're going to suffer from horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflation at some point.</v>

386
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.063
<v Speaker 3>This is my belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we have a fighting chance against </v>

387
00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:30.600
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the worst,</v>

388
00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:33.780
<v Speaker 3>most insidious tax of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is inflation,</v>

389
00:18:33.781 --> 00:18:35.190
<v Speaker 3>which erodes the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

390
00:18:35.191 --> 00:18:36.024
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're buying capacity for the money </v>

391
00:18:37.771 --> 00:18:40.110
<v Speaker 3>that you earn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing worse than inflation,</v>

392
00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:40.944
<v Speaker 3>but that's what we're looking at if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't actually just get some common </v>

393
00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:47.130
<v Speaker 3>sense a at the helm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when you say,</v>

394
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:48.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those in need,</v>

395
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:52.380
<v Speaker 3>like particularly or specifically what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what programs are,</v>

396
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:54.450
<v Speaker 3>what's in place right now that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>agree with?</v>

397
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Don't agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

398
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:56.933
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there's anything that I really don't </v>

399
00:18:58.321 --> 00:18:59.154
<v Speaker 3>agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just within the context of those </v>

400
00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:04.170
<v Speaker 3>programs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have lines drawn for eligibility.</v>

401
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.950
<v Speaker 3>Should there be cell phones?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just use this as an example.</v>

402
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.830
<v Speaker 3>Should those people on welfare have cell</v>
<v Speaker 3>phones?</v>

403
00:19:10.831 --> 00:19:12.930
<v Speaker 3>While the argument is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that uh,</v>

404
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.680
<v Speaker 3>without a cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't be connected to a job well,</v>

405
00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:18.240
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it really mean a job?</v>

406
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.660
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I point that out just as a,</v>

407
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.960
<v Speaker 3>this was a line drawn that this is now </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

408
00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:25.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

409
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.453
<v Speaker 3>a benefit of being on welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A benefit of being on welfare is that </v>

410
00:19:29.941 --> 00:19:32.590
<v Speaker 3>you get a cell phone of benefit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>welfare is,</v>

411
00:19:32.591 --> 00:19:34.440
<v Speaker 3>is that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a cell phone.</v>

412
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.423
<v Speaker 3>So there's an allotment or an allowance </v>
<v Speaker 3>for cell phone usage or something like </v>

413
00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:39.324
<v Speaker 3>the federal government spends multi </v>
<v Speaker 3>billions of dollars a year on cell </v>

414
00:19:43.561 --> 00:19:47.010
<v Speaker 3>phones for those on welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

415
00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:47.970
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

416
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.490
<v Speaker 3>I just point that out as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gee,</v>

417
00:19:50.491 --> 00:19:51.324
<v Speaker 3>is that really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that really a function of government </v>

418
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.750
<v Speaker 3>and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't people be connected?</v>

419
00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the notion that if you can work,</v>

420
00:20:01.171 --> 00:20:03.840
<v Speaker 3>you should work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The notion that if,</v>

421
00:20:03.841 --> 00:20:06.450
<v Speaker 3>let's say the government is giving you </v>
<v Speaker 3>$100,</v>

422
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.793
<v Speaker 3>these are very theoretical figures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's just say the government's </v>

423
00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:13.590
<v Speaker 3>giving them $100 a month and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can't work.</v>

424
00:20:13.591 --> 00:20:15.690
<v Speaker 3>If you work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to lose the hundred dollars</v>

425
00:20:15.691 --> 00:20:18.990
<v Speaker 3>a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about the notion of if you work,</v>

426
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:23.790
<v Speaker 3>the government will give you 75 bucks </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can make a hundred bucks.</v>

427
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:27.990
<v Speaker 3>So at the end of the day you're working </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you make $175.</v>

428
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't that make sense.</v>

429
00:20:30.331 --> 00:20:35.331
<v Speaker 3>Little less money from the government </v>
<v Speaker 3>incentivizing you to actually go out and</v>

430
00:20:35.641 --> 00:20:36.474
<v Speaker 3>get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is as simple as what I'm talking </v>

431
00:20:40.261 --> 00:20:43.590
<v Speaker 3>about having done the exact same thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>in New Mexico.</v>

432
00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:44.503
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the supreme court ruled that what I did </v>

433
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.780
<v Speaker 3>administratively was unconstitutional </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

434
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Speaker 3>and what did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the exact ruling?</v>

435
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.410
<v Speaker 3>Like what did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

436
00:20:53.411 --> 00:20:57.340
<v Speaker 3>what we did is just exactly what I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>now said is,</v>

437
00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.203
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the government is giving you $100 a </v>

438
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:00.874
<v Speaker 3>month.</v>

439
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.713
<v Speaker 3>How about the notion that if few there </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a requirement that if you </v>

440
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:05.590
<v Speaker 3>can work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will work.</v>

441
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.650
<v Speaker 3>So now you can go out and make $100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>without getting penalize.</v>

442
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.590
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you were,</v>

443
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:12.663
<v Speaker 3>but without getting penalize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you make $100 and instead of the </v>

444
00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:20.560
<v Speaker 3>government paying use $100 a month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government pays you $75 a month.</v>

445
00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:21.394
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the day you've got a job </v>
<v Speaker 3>and now you're getting $175 and I'm </v>

446
00:21:25.301 --> 00:21:26.410
<v Speaker 3>making sense here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

447
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what we implemented.</v>

448
00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:29.794
<v Speaker 3>All the help wanted signs in the state </v>
<v Speaker 3>went down because everybody had to go </v>

449
00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:33.484
<v Speaker 3>out and get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the legislature sued me immediately </v>

450
00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:39.400
<v Speaker 3>on the basis that what I was doing was </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconstitutional,</v>

451
00:21:39.401 --> 00:21:42.820
<v Speaker 3>that what I was doing needed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>passed by the legislature,</v>

452
00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:47.680
<v Speaker 3>that it couldn't be an executive order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And after six weeks of implementing this</v>

453
00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:48.650
<v Speaker 3>program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

454
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.533
<v Speaker 3>the Supreme Court in New Mexico ruled </v>
<v Speaker 3>that what I had done was </v>

455
00:21:51.821 --> 00:21:53.050
<v Speaker 3>unconstitutional.</v>

456
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not here to debate that,</v>

457
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.020
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we kind of proved that what I was saying</v>

458
00:21:59.021 --> 00:21:59.854
<v Speaker 3>was correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never did a back it up with </v>

459
00:22:02.231 --> 00:22:05.560
<v Speaker 3>legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could have overridden the courts by</v>

460
00:22:05.561 --> 00:22:08.680
<v Speaker 3>just caudifying what we did in </v>
<v Speaker 3>legislation.</v>

461
00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.630
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they never did that.</v>

462
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.760
<v Speaker 3>So what you're saying is what you did </v>
<v Speaker 3>was effective,</v>

463
00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:17.260
<v Speaker 3>but they just ruled it unconstitutional </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they never changed any of the rules.</v>

464
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:18.760
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

465
00:22:18.761 --> 00:22:20.680
<v Speaker 3>Is that frustrating for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

466
00:22:20.681 --> 00:22:21.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

467
00:22:21.971 --> 00:22:25.300
<v Speaker 3>it's the three branches of government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am very,</v>

468
00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm very reality based.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

469
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:29.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

470
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.290
<v Speaker 3>this is the power that the executive </v>
<v Speaker 3>has,</v>

471
00:22:32.291 --> 00:22:36.550
<v Speaker 3>the power power of the executives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The executive gets to run government now</v>

472
00:22:36.551 --> 00:22:39.760
<v Speaker 3>within the bounds of a legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

473
00:22:39.761 --> 00:22:41.980
<v Speaker 3>it is three branches of government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

474
00:22:41.981 --> 00:22:44.110
<v Speaker 3>I respect that and I understand it.</v>

475
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

476
00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.670
<v Speaker 3>it is the nature of the beast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you should,</v>

477
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:49.983
<v Speaker 3>that shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that should never dissuade you as an </v>

478
00:22:52.151 --> 00:22:54.940
<v Speaker 3>executive from doing what you think is </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

479
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.050
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

480
00:22:56.051 --> 00:22:57.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in many cases,</v>

481
00:22:57.971 --> 00:22:58.804
<v Speaker 3>like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where the court step in and </v>

482
00:22:59.861 --> 00:23:01.930
<v Speaker 3>that's where the legislature will step </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

483
00:23:01.931 --> 00:23:03.980
<v Speaker 3>It should have been legislated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if,</v>

484
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 3>if it was effective and it was proven to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be effective.</v>

485
00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:07.684
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well w all the help wanted signs in the </v>

486
00:23:08.891 --> 00:23:12.400
<v Speaker 3>state went down for six weeks and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately on this ruling,</v>

487
00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:14.260
<v Speaker 3>all the help wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>signs went back up.</v>

488
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:15.663
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>realistically though with a real actual </v>

489
00:23:17.111 --> 00:23:17.944
<v Speaker 3>numbers of like unemployment being down </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could show it and bring it to </v>

490
00:23:21.761 --> 00:23:22.420
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

491
00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.253
<v Speaker 3>if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the argument against what you </v>

492
00:23:24.131 --> 00:23:26.110
<v Speaker 3>did well that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

493
00:23:26.111 --> 00:23:31.111
<v Speaker 3>that they did not that what I did needed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be legislated as opposed to executive</v>

494
00:23:32.231 --> 00:23:34.990
<v Speaker 3>action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once it was proven to be effective,</v>

495
00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:39.580
<v Speaker 3>what would you would think that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be?</v>

496
00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:44.830
<v Speaker 3>So I was a Republican governor in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexico,</v>

497
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.730
<v Speaker 3>two to one democrat.</v>

498
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.033
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the big surprises I've had a </v>

499
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.690
<v Speaker 2>having served as governors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

500
00:23:51.691 --> 00:23:52.524
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really naive Lee thought at the end of </v>

501
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.943
<v Speaker 2>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats and Republicans would come </v>

502
00:23:55.851 --> 00:24:00.500
<v Speaker 2>together over issues that were right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning do the right thing as opposed to</v>

503
00:24:00.501 --> 00:24:03.950
<v Speaker 2>lining up politically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in this case,</v>

504
00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lined up politically and um,</v>

505
00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.530
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and never pass the legislation that,</v>

506
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.350
<v Speaker 2>and six weeks was not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

507
00:24:13.351 --> 00:24:14.930
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say anecdotally,</v>

508
00:24:14.931 --> 00:24:16.640
<v Speaker 2>all the help wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>signs went down.</v>

509
00:24:16.641 --> 00:24:20.360
<v Speaker 2>They did go down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really not enough time to garner the</v>

510
00:24:20.361 --> 00:24:21.194
<v Speaker 2>statistics that could have made that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact a national program emulated by </v>

511
00:24:25.101 --> 00:24:27.770
<v Speaker 2>other states because we would have shown</v>
<v Speaker 2>success doing it.</v>

512
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.560
<v Speaker 2>Here's one for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

513
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.790
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so welfare in New Mexico,</v>

514
00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:35.693
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a health insurance policy as </v>

515
00:24:38.541 --> 00:24:40.460
<v Speaker 2>governor of New Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

516
00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:42.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is given to me.</v>

517
00:24:42.441 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a perk.</v>

518
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.923
<v Speaker 2>Being governor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a health insurance policy covers </v>

519
00:24:46.761 --> 00:24:48.620
<v Speaker 2>me and my family is governor of New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>

520
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:53.840
<v Speaker 2>We took all the welfare recipients in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the state and uh,</v>

521
00:24:53.841 --> 00:24:58.130
<v Speaker 2>which were a quarter of a million and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

522
00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.030
<v Speaker 2>200,000 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And did the math,</v>

523
00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.893
<v Speaker 2>gee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if we gave all of them my health </v>

524
00:25:05.631 --> 00:25:06.464
<v Speaker 2>insurance policy as opposed to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying the bills when it came to </v>

525
00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:12.110
<v Speaker 2>welfare?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get it.</v>

526
00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:12.944
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody on welfare would receive my </v>

527
00:25:15.111 --> 00:25:17.780
<v Speaker 2>insurance policy as governor of New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>

528
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Would we really save 20%?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

529
00:25:21.831 --> 00:25:23.150
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did that.</v>

530
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.980
<v Speaker 2>We did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happened.</v>

531
00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:26.840
<v Speaker 2>And as comedy saved 20%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

532
00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:29.450
<v Speaker 2>And Save 20%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

533
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.930
<v Speaker 2>and to this day that is still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is still in place.</v>

534
00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:33.764
<v Speaker 2>That was moving from a fee for service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning if you were on welfare and you </v>

535
00:25:37.101 --> 00:25:39.650
<v Speaker 2>went to the hospital or you went to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergency room,</v>

536
00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.013
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill was sent to the State Medicaid and </v>

537
00:25:45.021 --> 00:25:45.854
<v Speaker 2>the state paid that bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three quarters of that bill got picked </v>

538
00:25:48.171 --> 00:25:49.004
<v Speaker 2>up by the federal government and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>quarter of it gets picked up by the </v>

539
00:25:51.171 --> 00:25:53.210
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a medicaid.</v>

540
00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by switching to a,</v>

541
00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.720
<v Speaker 2>an insurance model or a managed care </v>
<v Speaker 2>model,</v>

542
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:03.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we save 20% on the whole bill.</v>

543
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:07.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just common sense,</v>

544
00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:08.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Max.</v>

545
00:26:08.721 --> 00:26:11.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean just really flabbergasting</v>

546
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.650
<v Speaker 5>now when you look at things like </v>
<v Speaker 5>obamacare and the criticism of obamacare</v>

547
00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.270
<v Speaker 5>and you look at what you were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>implement in your own state,</v>

548
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.570
<v Speaker 5>wha what do you think could have been </v>
<v Speaker 5>done differently?</v>

549
00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

550
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I think that a welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

551
00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.430
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medicare,</v>

552
00:26:27.431 --> 00:26:28.264
<v Speaker 2>so healthcare for those over 65,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the federal government needs to </v>

553
00:26:31.121 --> 00:26:34.630
<v Speaker 2>devolve both of these services to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>

554
00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>currently of course,</v>

555
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.003
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare for those over 65 is </v>

556
00:26:39.701 --> 00:26:42.700
<v Speaker 2>completely federal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in my heart of hearts,</v>

557
00:26:42.701 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 2>if the government would have</v>

558
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.750
<v Speaker 3>blocked granted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Mexico,</v>

559
00:26:45.751 --> 00:26:48.090
<v Speaker 3>a fixed amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

560
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.010
<v Speaker 3>just kept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

561
00:26:50.011 --> 00:26:50.844
<v Speaker 3>this is just runaway expenditure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the worst runaway expenditures </v>

562
00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:56.250
<v Speaker 3>in federal government today is Medicaid </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Medicare.</v>

563
00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.760
<v Speaker 3>But if they would have just kept it or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the historical increased being 7%,</v>

564
00:27:02.371 --> 00:27:03.204
<v Speaker 3>if they'd had just given a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent increase to the state of New </v>

565
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.120
<v Speaker 3>Mexico as opposed to let's say 7% and </v>
<v Speaker 3>said New Mexico,</v>

566
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.590
<v Speaker 3>Governor Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are in charge of healthcare delivery</v>

567
00:27:13.591 --> 00:27:15.390
<v Speaker 3>to those that are poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

568
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.910
<v Speaker 3>welfare and those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

569
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.920
<v Speaker 3>health care to those that are over 65 in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my heart of hearts,</v>

570
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:24.330
<v Speaker 3>I believe that I could have delivered </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are seen over the administration of</v>

571
00:27:24.331 --> 00:27:28.350
<v Speaker 3>the delivery of that healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you did,</v>

572
00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:29.184
<v Speaker 3>if the federal government did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the only way to reform </v>

573
00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:34.050
<v Speaker 3>Medicaid and Medicare is devolve it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the states,</v>

574
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.950
<v Speaker 3>50 laboratories of innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>best practice,</v>

575
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:42.150
<v Speaker 3>there would be some fabulous success </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would get emulated.</v>

576
00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.760
<v Speaker 3>There'd be horrible failure that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>get avoided.</v>

577
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.840
<v Speaker 3>But as opposed to one size fits all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>federal government,</v>

578
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:49.674
<v Speaker 3>we'd actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd actually come up with solutions on </v>

579
00:27:52.261 --> 00:27:54.810
<v Speaker 3>how to cap and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how to,</v>

580
00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:58.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>main or contain the costs within,</v>

581
00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.233
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within the system talking about Obama </v>

582
00:28:02.181 --> 00:28:03.350
<v Speaker 3>care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

583
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:08.460
<v Speaker 3>what we really need when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthcare is just free market solutions</v>

584
00:28:08.461 --> 00:28:09.294
<v Speaker 3>to healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by in healthcare is as far removed </v>

585
00:28:14.641 --> 00:28:15.474
<v Speaker 3>from free market right now as it </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly can be in a free market system </v>

586
00:28:19.561 --> 00:28:21.300
<v Speaker 3>for healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would have,</v>

587
00:28:21.301 --> 00:28:22.134
<v Speaker 3>we would not have health insurance to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cover ourselves for ongoing medical </v>

588
00:28:25.651 --> 00:28:26.484
<v Speaker 3>need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would have health insurance to cover </v>

589
00:28:28.321 --> 00:28:31.290
<v Speaker 3>ourselves for catastrophic injury and </v>
<v Speaker 3>illness.</v>

590
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.650
<v Speaker 3>And we would pay as you go in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

591
00:28:34.651 --> 00:28:38.340
<v Speaker 3>that would probably cost about one fifth</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what it currently costs.</v>

592
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.473
<v Speaker 3>We would have gallbladders are us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd have gallbladder surgery for </v>

593
00:28:43.171 --> 00:28:46.980
<v Speaker 3>thousands of dollars as opposed to tens </v>
<v Speaker 3>of thousands of dollars.</v>

594
00:28:46.981 --> 00:28:50.030
<v Speaker 3>We'd have stitches are us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd have x-ray's Aros,</v>

595
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:51.383
<v Speaker 3>we'd have the radiologist's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>next two s x rays are us to read those </v>

596
00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.290
<v Speaker 3>x-rays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

597
00:28:58.860 --> 00:28:59.693
<v Speaker 3>and at the end of the day we would pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of pocket for those services and </v>

598
00:29:03.571 --> 00:29:06.060
<v Speaker 3>they would be a fifth of what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>currently are.</v>

599
00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.140
<v Speaker 4>So in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're saying is that right now the</v>

600
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.710
<v Speaker 4>medical health care is kind of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>subsidized by the government?</v>

601
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.913
<v Speaker 4>Well right now it's almost like an </v>
<v Speaker 4>unrealistic amount of money is being </v>

602
00:29:17.241 --> 00:29:18.500
<v Speaker 4>spent on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what you're saying?</v>

603
00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:21.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now health insurance would be like</v>

604
00:29:21.131 --> 00:29:24.080
<v Speaker 3>having grocery and insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

605
00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.680
<v Speaker 3>you got grocery insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a I go to the,</v>

606
00:29:26.681 --> 00:29:27.514
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to the supermarket and there's no </v>

607
00:29:29.951 --> 00:29:32.950
<v Speaker 3>prices on any of the shelves cause I got</v>
<v Speaker 3>grocery insurance.</v>

608
00:29:32.951 --> 00:29:36.640
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter what anything costs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I going to buy a hamburger?</v>

609
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:37.411
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why you,</v>

610
00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:41.020
<v Speaker 3>why should I buy hamburger when I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>grocery insurance and I can buy a,</v>

611
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:42.020
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

612
00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:42.853
<v Speaker 1>But in the one of that logic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what does anyone doing differently </v>

613
00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:45.874
<v Speaker 1>because they have health insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they're getting extra </v>

614
00:29:47.981 --> 00:29:49.390
<v Speaker 1>treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

615
00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:51.400
<v Speaker 1>so in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well right now,</v>

616
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chief justice Roberts when he said that,</v>

617
00:29:54.611 --> 00:29:56.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>

618
00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.393
<v Speaker 1>obamacare was attacks on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My personal insurance premiums have </v>

619
00:30:01.751 --> 00:30:05.590
<v Speaker 1>quadrupled and I have not been to see a </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor in three years.</v>

620
00:30:05.591 --> 00:30:06.424
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

621
00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.413
<v Speaker 1>so it's a tax for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm subsidizing those that aren't </v>

622
00:30:09.791 --> 00:30:11.410
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

623
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:12.663
<v Speaker 1>I wish I didn't have to have insurance </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cover myself for ongoing medical </v>

624
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:17.800
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

625
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.340
<v Speaker 1>we go into the hospital right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no advertised pricing.</v>

626
00:30:21.341 --> 00:30:23.410
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea what you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay.</v>

627
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.220
<v Speaker 1>There is no statistics on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the wall that say,</v>

628
00:30:27.221 --> 00:30:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're here for gallbladder surgery,</v>

629
00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:33.670
<v Speaker 1>you can expect a 99% outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's none of that.</v>

630
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.490
<v Speaker 1>If you had a free market approach to </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>

631
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.900
<v Speaker 1>you would have all of that.</v>

632
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.320
<v Speaker 1>You'd have advertised pricing and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have a,</v>

633
00:30:41.321 --> 00:30:43.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outcomes based on,</v>

634
00:30:43.991 --> 00:30:44.920
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

635
00:30:44.921 --> 00:30:46.120
<v Speaker 1>on prior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

636
00:30:46.121 --> 00:30:46.954
<v Speaker 1>patients that had gone in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is an issue with people that </v>

637
00:30:49.031 --> 00:30:52.270
<v Speaker 1>do have injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a catastrophic injury,</v>

638
00:30:52.271 --> 00:30:53.104
<v Speaker 1>whether it's some sort of a disease that</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes up where the amount of money that </v>

639
00:30:55.661 --> 00:30:56.494
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have to spend for </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare can be catastrophic and </v>

640
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.630
<v Speaker 1>astronomical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

641
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.553
<v Speaker 1>I started out by saying we would not </v>
<v Speaker 1>have insurance to cover ourselves for </v>

642
00:31:05.141 --> 00:31:05.974
<v Speaker 1>ongoing need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we would have insurance to cover </v>

643
00:31:08.021 --> 00:31:10.270
<v Speaker 1>ourselves for catastrophic injury and </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>

644
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.490
<v Speaker 1>But how do you define what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic and what's not?</v>

645
00:31:12.491 --> 00:31:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Like if you get cancer and dollar </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount,</v>

646
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:15.440
<v Speaker 1>dollar amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

647
00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.850
<v Speaker 1>What about the health consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoiding or not avoiding treatment?</v>

648
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Because there's going to be a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that don't have the money and are</v>

649
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:26.050
<v Speaker 1>going to just deal with certain issues </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a surgery perhaps that you need and</v>

650
00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:27.190
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to avoid it.</v>

651
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Knee surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines,</v>

652
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.810
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>considered catastrophic.</v>

653
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

654
00:31:32.501 --> 00:31:34.900
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond a certain dollar amount.</v>

655
00:31:34.901 --> 00:31:35.734
<v Speaker 1>I mean these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the things that you could </v>

656
00:31:36.731 --> 00:31:37.564
<v Speaker 1>choose in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a genuine free market approach to </v>

657
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:41.740
<v Speaker 1>health care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about like a meniscus scope,</v>

658
00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.860
<v Speaker 1>like a meniscus scope?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meniscus tears can be incredibly painful</v>

659
00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:45.850
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

660
00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.780
<v Speaker 1>get scoped a few thousand dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would that be considered catastrophic?</v>

661
00:31:49.781 --> 00:31:50.614
<v Speaker 1>It's not really catastrophic engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well today it's a few thousand dollars </v>

662
00:31:53.471 --> 00:31:58.150
<v Speaker 1>because it's one of those no advertise </v>
<v Speaker 1>pricing for meniscus tear.</v>

663
00:31:58.151 --> 00:32:01.480
<v Speaker 1>And having had several meniscus tears </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

664
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:02.333
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a free market approach to </v>

665
00:32:04.151 --> 00:32:05.740
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have meniscus.</v>

666
00:32:05.741 --> 00:32:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Tears are us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we specialize in meniscus tears,</v>

667
00:32:08.771 --> 00:32:10.380
<v Speaker 1>here are our outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

668
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:11.673
<v Speaker 1>you can come in and get a meniscus tear </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery for what would end up to be </v>

669
00:32:15.041 --> 00:32:17.200
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of dollars as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of.</v>

670
00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:20.170
<v Speaker 1>So sort of like the way they do like </v>
<v Speaker 1>lasik eye surgery today.</v>

671
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Great example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Advertise pricing,</v>

672
00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:24.850
<v Speaker 1>cosmetic surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

673
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dentistry now,</v>

674
00:32:26.141 --> 00:32:26.974
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're starting to see advertised</v>
<v Speaker 1>pricing and as opposed to the hundred </v>

675
00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:33.130
<v Speaker 1>dollar ass than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go into the hospital,</v>

676
00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:33.964
<v Speaker 1>when you read the fine print,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course you're not paying for it </v>

677
00:32:36.101 --> 00:32:37.900
<v Speaker 1>so you don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense,</v>

678
00:32:37.901 --> 00:32:40.280
<v Speaker 1>you would essentially go to a hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would diagnose</v>

679
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.031
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would tell you,</v>

680
00:32:41.031 --> 00:32:41.864
<v Speaker 4>here's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to get a gallbladder and then </v>

681
00:32:43.851 --> 00:32:45.230
<v Speaker 4>you'd go to gallbladders are us.</v>

682
00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Well or just from the very beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

683
00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:49.980
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with me?</v>

684
00:32:49.981 --> 00:32:50.814
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd man with the Internet today and </v>

685
00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.530
<v Speaker 3>there could be so much innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>

686
00:32:56.531 --> 00:32:57.720
<v Speaker 3>why do we even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>

687
00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.540
<v Speaker 3>I am talking about a utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>

688
00:33:00.541 --> 00:33:03.630
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to say utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is very doable.</v>

689
00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:08.260
<v Speaker 3>This is something that a government </v>
<v Speaker 3>could really lay the groundwork for a,</v>

690
00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.113
<v Speaker 3>but that it's like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far removed from what I'm talking </v>

691
00:33:13.171 --> 00:33:13.510
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

692
00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:16.390
<v Speaker 4>fiscally conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you say fiscally conservative,</v>

693
00:33:16.391 --> 00:33:19.300
<v Speaker 4>when you talk about issues like welfare </v>
<v Speaker 4>and things along those lines,</v>

694
00:33:19.301 --> 00:33:21.670
<v Speaker 4>people get a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people do,</v>

695
00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:26.940
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you are perhaps callous or uncaring</v>

696
00:33:27.011 --> 00:33:28.970
<v Speaker 4>about poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That that's the route.</v>

697
00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:29.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying</v>

698
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.051
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

699
00:33:30.051 --> 00:33:30.884
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that is,</v>

700
00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:32.363
<v Speaker 3>but in our own lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look its best pr in our own lives as </v>

701
00:33:35.121 --> 00:33:37.760
<v Speaker 3>best product.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's best service at the lowest price.</v>

702
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.050
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how we,</v>

703
00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:42.080
<v Speaker 3>that's how we analyze things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't give away our own money.</v>

704
00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.270
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why should government be giving?</v>

705
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.730
<v Speaker 3>Why shouldn't government have the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>credo?</v>

706
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.943
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I was going to get at was what </v>

707
00:33:48.911 --> 00:33:51.820
<v Speaker 4>you're saying as far as like the 50 </v>
<v Speaker 4>states.</v>

708
00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:57.490
<v Speaker 4>That is probably one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting thing about having 50 states</v>

709
00:33:57.491 --> 00:34:01.840
<v Speaker 4>is that you can have 50 different </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiments and you have 50 different,</v>

710
00:34:01.841 --> 00:34:06.220
<v Speaker 4>and we're seeing that of course with </v>
<v Speaker 4>legalized marijuana in Colorado bringing</v>

711
00:34:06.221 --> 00:34:09.340
<v Speaker 4>in more tax revenue than alcohol for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first time ever.</v>

712
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.593
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is a huge thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening right now in Colorado and </v>

713
00:34:13.541 --> 00:34:14.374
<v Speaker 4>experiment in government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the federal government tried to </v>

714
00:34:17.231 --> 00:34:19.750
<v Speaker 4>block it at one point and they were very</v>
<v Speaker 4>concerned with it,</v>

715
00:34:19.751 --> 00:34:20.584
<v Speaker 4>but now they're letting it go and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>proving to be incredibly financially </v>

716
00:34:23.321 --> 00:34:24.154
<v Speaker 4>beneficial to that state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you're seeing Seattle or Washington </v>

717
00:34:27.461 --> 00:34:28.660
<v Speaker 4>state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Washington,</v>

718
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.330
<v Speaker 4>DC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other states are starting to join in and</v>

719
00:34:31.331 --> 00:34:34.810
<v Speaker 4>it's going probably go nationwide within</v>
<v Speaker 4>the next decade or so.</v>

720
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a perfect example,</v>

721
00:34:37.361 --> 00:34:39.220
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of states coming up with an experiment,</v>

722
00:34:39.221 --> 00:34:40.054
<v Speaker 4>the experiment proven to be fiscally </v>
<v Speaker 4>effective and then moving forward with </v>

723
00:34:43.211 --> 00:34:43.700
<v Speaker 4>it</v>

724
00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:44.533
<v Speaker 3>and Colorado probably have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has done the best job when it comes to </v>

725
00:34:47.451 --> 00:34:50.960
<v Speaker 3>the recreational states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington state has done the worst job.</v>

726
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.823
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning that the taxes are so high in </v>

727
00:34:54.261 --> 00:34:55.860
<v Speaker 3>Washington state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

728
00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.713
<v Speaker 3>that the black market is alive and well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How hard is the taxes in Washington </v>

729
00:34:59.421 --> 00:35:04.421
<v Speaker 3>state to Colorado's 39% in Washington </v>
<v Speaker 3>state?</v>

730
00:35:04.461 --> 00:35:06.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Washington state,</v>

731
00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:10.610
<v Speaker 3>they'll have an whatever the rate is </v>
<v Speaker 3>though it applies four times.</v>

732
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.350
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it applies to growing,</v>

733
00:35:12.351 --> 00:35:15.190
<v Speaker 3>it applies to processing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It applies to every single.</v>

734
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:19.850
<v Speaker 3>So that at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two summers ago,</v>

735
00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:20.684
<v Speaker 3>right after Washington state implemented</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and that a pot went on sale at one </v>

736
00:35:24.981 --> 00:35:27.290
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana in,</v>

737
00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.124
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Washington state was selling for 26 </v>

738
00:35:30.441 --> 00:35:32.930
<v Speaker 3>grand a pound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

739
00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:37.010
<v Speaker 3>$65 a gram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

740
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:37.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for</v>

741
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.770
<v Speaker 1>what you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had people lined up around,</v>

742
00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:41.604
<v Speaker 1>not around the block.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who'd never used marijuana </v>

743
00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:44.574
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well everybody that had been using </v>

744
00:35:46.201 --> 00:35:47.034
<v Speaker 1>marijuana continued to get it on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>black market because that was and is </v>

745
00:35:50.731 --> 00:35:51.930
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

746
00:35:51.931 --> 00:35:55.080
<v Speaker 1>and these are the regulations as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal growing.</v>

747
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some states.</v>

748
00:35:57.751 --> 00:35:58.530
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

749
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:01.860
<v Speaker 1>to me that's also a common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

750
00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:02.703
<v Speaker 1>I'm caveat to this legislation is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to allow for home grow this the </v>

751
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.450
<v Speaker 1>same way you get your groceries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

752
00:36:09.451 --> 00:36:11.920
<v Speaker 1>it really should be no different if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to grow your own tomatoes.</v>

753
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And grow your own standards.</v>

754
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.690
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've always said that this,</v>

755
00:36:15.691 --> 00:36:16.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always talk about,</v>

756
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:19.590
<v Speaker 1>or everybody is talking about the tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenue,</v>

757
00:36:19.591 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is correct.</v>

758
00:36:20.851 --> 00:36:21.684
<v Speaker 1>It's significant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more significant than the tax </v>

759
00:36:24.601 --> 00:36:27.420
<v Speaker 1>revenue is the savings in law </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforcement.</v>

760
00:36:27.421 --> 00:36:27.960
<v Speaker 1>The courts.</v>

761
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.793
<v Speaker 1>And the prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the highest incarceration rate </v>

762
00:36:31.681 --> 00:36:32.514
<v Speaker 1>of any country in the world and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason behind that is that the war on </v>

763
00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:37.494
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got tens of millions of convicted </v>

764
00:36:40.321 --> 00:36:41.154
<v Speaker 1>felons in this country that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for our dog drug laws would </v>

765
00:36:43.951 --> 00:36:48.330
<v Speaker 1>otherwise be tax paying law abiding </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens and the drug war.</v>

766
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:51.210
<v Speaker 1>That is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge factor.</v>

767
00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge factor in distrust and law</v>
<v Speaker 1>enforcement.</v>

768
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:55.163
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge factor in frustration with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the system feeling disenfranchised with </v>

769
00:36:58.561 --> 00:37:01.140
<v Speaker 1>the the very system that's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be governing us.</v>

770
00:37:01.141 --> 00:37:03.930
<v Speaker 1>You just feel like it's your enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black lives matter.</v>

771
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.320
<v Speaker 1>At the heart of that is the drug war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the heart of that.</v>

772
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:12.390
<v Speaker 1>At the heart of the militarization of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our police forces is breaking down doors</v>

773
00:37:12.391 --> 00:37:13.224
<v Speaker 1>in the name of confiscating drugs and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of that has been recently revealed </v>

774
00:37:17.911 --> 00:37:21.060
<v Speaker 1>with started off during the Nixon </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration as just trying to control</v>

775
00:37:21.061 --> 00:37:21.894
<v Speaker 1>the civil rights movement and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>control the antiwar movement the way </v>

776
00:37:24.481 --> 00:37:24.990
<v Speaker 1>they did it.</v>

777
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:27.180
<v Speaker 1>They recognize that these people using </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>

778
00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.670
<v Speaker 1>let's go after them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make it a big deal.</v>

779
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:30.533
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those political boogeyman that a </v>

780
00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:33.774
<v Speaker 1>as a politician elect me and I will save</v>
<v Speaker 1>you from the ills of marijuana right </v>

781
00:37:37.921 --> 00:37:40.840
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another one of those political boogeyman</v>

782
00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.190
<v Speaker 1>is immigration and it's a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>boogeyman look.</v>

783
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Immigration is really a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not taking jobs that US citizens</v>

784
00:37:49.801 --> 00:37:50.634
<v Speaker 1>want and it's not an issue of lower pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless it's an issue of language and </v>

785
00:37:53.911 --> 00:37:56.070
<v Speaker 1>they're the first ones that recognize </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

786
00:37:56.071 --> 00:37:58.770
<v Speaker 1>And building a wall across the border is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just crazy.</v>

787
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.020
<v Speaker 1>What can be done at this point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone became a president,</v>

788
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:07.320
<v Speaker 1>what could be done to stop this influx </v>
<v Speaker 1>of private prisons,</v>

789
00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:08.183
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this prison industrial complex that we </v>

790
00:38:09.661 --> 00:38:13.290
<v Speaker 1>were finding ourselves in this horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>quagmire with?</v>

791
00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't,</v>

792
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.130
<v Speaker 1>don't mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

793
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not just private prisons.</v>

794
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:22.830
<v Speaker 1>It's public prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That number one opposition to legalizing</v>

795
00:38:22.831 --> 00:38:25.890
<v Speaker 1>pot in California was the public prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>union.</v>

796
00:38:25.891 --> 00:38:29.280
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's guards union,</v>

797
00:38:29.281 --> 00:38:30.150
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

798
00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.180
<v Speaker 1>It's keep jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to keep jobs.</v>

799
00:38:33.181 --> 00:38:36.690
<v Speaker 1>We've got 2.3 million people bars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

800
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:38.530
<v Speaker 1>that's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's terrifying.</v>

801
00:38:38.531 --> 00:38:39.364
<v Speaker 1>That guards would want to keep jobs so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would want more people locked </v>

802
00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:45.010
<v Speaker 1>up for things that no one agrees with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really scary.</v>

803
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:45.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just,</v>

804
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll just say it's a bad rap for private</v>
<v Speaker 1>prisons as opposed to just prisons,</v>

805
00:38:51.281 --> 00:38:53.090
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

806
00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

807
00:38:55.121 --> 00:38:57.100
<v Speaker 1>as governor of New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

808
00:38:57.101 --> 00:39:00.940
<v Speaker 1>and I privatized half the state prisons </v>
<v Speaker 1>in New Mexico,</v>

809
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.730
<v Speaker 1>apples to apples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oranges to oranges.</v>

810
00:39:03.731 --> 00:39:08.370
<v Speaker 1>The private prisons offered up the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>goods and services for two thirds.</v>

811
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:09.223
<v Speaker 1>The price and all that because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the government because they can do </v>

812
00:39:14.381 --> 00:39:17.980
<v Speaker 1>it for less money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like every aspect of life.</v>

813
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:18.933
<v Speaker 1>Private to can do it better than public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every aspect of life isn't the issue </v>

814
00:39:22.991 --> 00:39:25.270
<v Speaker 1>though with something like a private </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison.</v>

815
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.870
<v Speaker 1>So this is a private corporation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>profits from incarcerating people,</v>

816
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.780
<v Speaker 1>amazing that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can even profit and offer.</v>

817
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:33.850
<v Speaker 1>So in New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I may,</v>

818
00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.333
<v Speaker 1>when I took office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were 800 prisoners housed out of </v>

819
00:39:38.081 --> 00:39:38.914
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There had been massive prison riots in </v>

820
00:39:41.651 --> 00:39:42.484
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico so that the federal courts </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in charge of the prisons in New </v>

821
00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Mexico is called the Duran consent </v>
<v Speaker 1>decree.</v>

822
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:52.690
<v Speaker 1>The legislature refused to appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to build new prisons.</v>

823
00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:57.110
<v Speaker 1>It was a huge problem that we had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the private prison camp,</v>

824
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.330
<v Speaker 1>private prisons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wac,</v>

825
00:39:58.331 --> 00:39:59.164
<v Speaker 1>and Hud in particular came in and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the federal courts were running the </v>

826
00:40:03.281 --> 00:40:07.360
<v Speaker 1>prisons in New Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if what I'm about to tell you,</v>

827
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:08.223
<v Speaker 1>if you think that we were going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>away with any less goods or services </v>

828
00:40:12.611 --> 00:40:16.030
<v Speaker 1>being delivered to the prison industry </v>
<v Speaker 1>guests,</v>

829
00:40:16.031 --> 00:40:16.864
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>federal courts are running the prisons </v>

830
00:40:18.371 --> 00:40:23.050
<v Speaker 1>in New Mexico on an apples to apples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oranges to oranges basis.</v>

831
00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Instead of 100 bucks a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they offered it up for 66 bucks a day,</v>

832
00:40:27.431 --> 00:40:28.960
<v Speaker 1>two thirds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cost.</v>

833
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.110
<v Speaker 1>If that isn't good government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what is.</v>

834
00:40:32.111 --> 00:40:36.880
<v Speaker 1>And in New Mexico I constantly said if </v>
<v Speaker 1>we would adopt rational drug laws,</v>

835
00:40:36.881 --> 00:40:37.714
<v Speaker 1>if we could let people out of prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be a lot easier to empty the </v>

836
00:40:41.621 --> 00:40:44.410
<v Speaker 1>private prisons than it will be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>public prisons.</v>

837
00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse my ignorance on this,</v>

838
00:40:45.911 --> 00:40:46.744
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if I'm right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine that something like </v>

839
00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:49.714
<v Speaker 1>a private prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a company and it's a company </v>

840
00:40:51.881 --> 00:40:55.390
<v Speaker 1>that companies 10 to aspire towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth,</v>

841
00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:59.380
<v Speaker 1>and when you have a private prison that </v>
<v Speaker 1>profits off of people being in jail,</v>

842
00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:00.243
<v Speaker 1>you would attend to think that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would try to maximize their potential </v>

843
00:41:03.131 --> 00:41:05.860
<v Speaker 1>for growth or versus the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

844
00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:07.460
<v Speaker 1>It's logical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But May,</v>

845
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:10.780
<v Speaker 1>maybe the component in here that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing is,</v>

846
00:41:10.781 --> 00:41:13.540
<v Speaker 1>is as opposed to growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just think of it as,</v>

847
00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:14.523
<v Speaker 1>as stepping in and taking over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>services that are currently being </v>

848
00:41:17.621 --> 00:41:18.454
<v Speaker 1>provided for a lot less money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning taking over all the prisons and </v>

849
00:41:21.971 --> 00:41:24.620
<v Speaker 1>that would be their growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all presents.</v>

850
00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

851
00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.940
<v Speaker 1>and assuming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

852
00:41:27.941 --> 00:41:31.210
<v Speaker 1>this is my experience now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't get me wrong.</v>

853
00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

854
00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 1>there's just logic</v>

855
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.110
<v Speaker 3>behind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gee,</v>

856
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.540
<v Speaker 3>if you're a private prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're in it for the money.</v>

857
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's logical.</v>

858
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:42.620
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my experience,</v>

859
00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.950
<v Speaker 3>it's completely removed from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

860
00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:48.540
<v Speaker 5>But just in your experience in New </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mexico,</v>

861
00:41:48.541 --> 00:41:50.790
<v Speaker 5>in New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fairly small state,</v>

862
00:41:50.791 --> 00:41:53.010
<v Speaker 5>well not small,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't have a large population.</v>

863
00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.570
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

864
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:59.830
<v Speaker 3>and excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have there been,</v>

865
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:02.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

866
00:42:02.111 --> 00:42:05.530
<v Speaker 3>a private prisons that lobby for more </v>
<v Speaker 3>prisoners?</v>

867
00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:07.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to say that that hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

868
00:42:07.841 --> 00:42:10.630
<v Speaker 3>Didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did Not happen in New Mexico,</v>

869
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.793
<v Speaker 3>but just don't discount that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not happening on the public side </v>

870
00:42:16.211 --> 00:42:16.940
<v Speaker 3>also</v>

871
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.080
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

872
00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:20.060
<v Speaker 5>exactly what you're talking about with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the unions,</v>

873
00:42:20.061 --> 00:42:20.894
<v Speaker 5>the guard unions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are trying to somehow another </v>

874
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:25.340
<v Speaker 5>maximize their potential and maximize </v>
<v Speaker 5>their growth</v>

875
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.310
<v Speaker 3>and this mandatory sentencing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which really starts,</v>

876
00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the drug laws that we have.</v>

877
00:42:30.951 --> 00:42:33.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the reason why we have this high</v>

878
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:34.470
<v Speaker 3>incarceration rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

879
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.120
<v Speaker 5>That we have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How is it legal that these prison unions</v>

880
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:40.910
<v Speaker 5>actually do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

881
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:41.990
<v Speaker 5>what's that squeak?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that you?</v>

882
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:43.940
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

883
00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:50.560
<v Speaker 5>Let's try to figure out what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

884
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.220
<v Speaker 5>no legal though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

885
00:42:52.221 --> 00:42:53.054
<v Speaker 5>how is it legal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guardians can try to change laws and </v>

886
00:42:56.541 --> 00:43:00.260
<v Speaker 5>which where it's so transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like they're trying to lock bad</v>

887
00:43:00.261 --> 00:43:01.094
<v Speaker 5>people up because they're really </v>
<v Speaker 5>concerned about the safety of the </v>

888
00:43:02.211 --> 00:43:04.070
<v Speaker 5>public.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're worried about their jobs.</v>

889
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:04.993
<v Speaker 5>So they want to incarcerate people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>may or may not be incarcerated without </v>

890
00:43:08.271 --> 00:43:09.380
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their input.</v>

891
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:10.800
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

892
00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.200
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you nailed it.</v>

893
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Just extend that to other things that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>see also.</v>

894
00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.440
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see ads on television that say,</v>

895
00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.673
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>increase the expenditures for education </v>

896
00:43:21.711 --> 00:43:24.830
<v Speaker 3>that's being paid for from a tax </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars,</v>

897
00:43:24.831 --> 00:43:26.600
<v Speaker 3>from mud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from teachers,</v>

898
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That will advertise for that.</v>

899
00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:29.413
<v Speaker 3>We see advertisements all the time from </v>
<v Speaker 3>public institutions that in essence </v>

900
00:43:34.251 --> 00:43:38.030
<v Speaker 3>we're paying for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for increased funding all the time.</v>

901
00:43:38.031 --> 00:43:40.340
<v Speaker 3>Every time we turn around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is that fair?</v>

902
00:43:40.341 --> 00:43:45.341
<v Speaker 3>How is that legal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that a manipulation of our brains?</v>

903
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:47.200
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

904
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:48.330
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way that,</v>

905
00:43:48.331 --> 00:43:49.164
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times just belies the underlying </v>

906
00:43:52.101 --> 00:43:54.800
<v Speaker 3>logic that no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't get more money,</v>

907
00:43:54.801 --> 00:43:56.120
<v Speaker 3>they should get more efficient.</v>

908
00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:57.813
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the issue though is this is very </v>

909
00:43:59.081 --> 00:43:59.914
<v Speaker 5>different because you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>people lobbying to try to lock up other </v>

910
00:44:02.711 --> 00:44:05.530
<v Speaker 5>human beings for their own profit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

911
00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:06.730
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I say,</v>

912
00:44:06.731 --> 00:44:10.930
<v Speaker 5>your logical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're saying is logical.</v>

913
00:44:10.931 --> 00:44:12.670
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's got a perfect logic,</v>

914
00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:14.980
<v Speaker 5>kind of it's evil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

915
00:44:14.981 --> 00:44:16.360
<v Speaker 5>if you really think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they,</v>

916
00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:17.373
<v Speaker 5>if there's a brewpub,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people of the massive amount of the </v>

917
00:44:20.051 --> 00:44:20.884
<v Speaker 5>general public doesn't believe that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people should be in jail for a lot of </v>

918
00:44:23.111 --> 00:44:25.360
<v Speaker 5>the drug crimes are in jail for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially marijuana.</v>

919
00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.373
<v Speaker 5>If you look at the statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you look at the amount of money that's </v>

920
00:44:27.671 --> 00:44:29.530
<v Speaker 5>being spent on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most people would say,</v>

921
00:44:29.531 --> 00:44:31.770
<v Speaker 5>this is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got to stop this.</v>

922
00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:32.663
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

923
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:36.370
<v Speaker 3>I'd say I've been more vocal about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>than anybody in an elected office.</v>

924
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:39.680
<v Speaker 4>So when prison unions lobby contrary to</v>

925
00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:40.990
<v Speaker 3>prison unions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

926
00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:46.330
<v Speaker 3>prison unions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're public or either side of it,</v>

927
00:44:47.001 --> 00:44:47.610
<v Speaker 3>lobbies</v>

928
00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:48.443
<v Speaker 4>four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four,</v>

929
00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.070
<v Speaker 4>four more lock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Contrary to public opinion,</v>

930
00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:53.710
<v Speaker 4>there should be an investigation and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be criminal.</v>

931
00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:54.693
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing is you're lobbying to </v>

932
00:44:55.751 --> 00:44:56.584
<v Speaker 4>try to go against the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wishes of the general public to put </v>

933
00:44:58.961 --> 00:44:59.794
<v Speaker 4>people in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's only one reason it's to </v>

934
00:45:01.841 --> 00:45:02.674
<v Speaker 4>maximize profit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not talking about any threat to </v>

935
00:45:04.271 --> 00:45:05.104
<v Speaker 4>the public.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not talking about any healthcare </v>

936
00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.113
<v Speaker 4>threat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not talking about any tax burden </v>

937
00:45:08.651 --> 00:45:11.350
<v Speaker 4>from people out there smoking marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 4>was selling marijuana.</v>

938
00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:14.260
<v Speaker 4>What you're talking about is maximizing </v>
<v Speaker 4>your profit as a guard.</v>

939
00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.210
<v Speaker 4>That should be illegal</v>

940
00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:18.240
<v Speaker 3>spot on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

941
00:45:18.241 --> 00:45:23.241
<v Speaker 3>I would just ask everybody listening to </v>
<v Speaker 3>just apply that same argument to a whole</v>

942
00:45:24.301 --> 00:45:26.700
<v Speaker 3>lot of other things that we're exposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to when it comes to.</v>

943
00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:27.853
<v Speaker 4>So let's talk about if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you apply that same argument to </v>

944
00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:33.410
<v Speaker 4>education,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it,</v>

945
00:45:33.411 --> 00:45:34.580
<v Speaker 4>what's your take on that?</v>

946
00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Well fit back to 50 laboratories of </v>
<v Speaker 3>innovation and best practice.</v>

947
00:45:40.211 --> 00:45:43.690
<v Speaker 3>The federal government should not be </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in education at all.</v>

948
00:45:43.691 --> 00:45:44.524
<v Speaker 3>And very quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>federal government gives each state 11 </v>

949
00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:51.460
<v Speaker 3>cents out of every school dollar that </v>
<v Speaker 3>every state spends,</v>

950
00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.610
<v Speaker 3>but it comes with 15 cents where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>strings attached.</v>

951
00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:56.440
<v Speaker 3>The federal government says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

952
00:45:56.441 --> 00:45:58.750
<v Speaker 3>we're going to give you 11 cents and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to do a,</v>

953
00:45:58.751 --> 00:45:59.471
<v Speaker 3>b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>

954
00:45:59.471 --> 00:46:01.930
<v Speaker 3>and d to get the 11 cents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are those?</v>

955
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.790
<v Speaker 3>What are those steps they have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

956
00:46:03.791 --> 00:46:08.530
<v Speaker 3>one of those steps is now providing </v>
<v Speaker 3>transgender bathrooms.</v>

957
00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:09.483
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the Obama administration has now </v>

958
00:46:12.101 --> 00:46:13.570
<v Speaker 3>stated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't,</v>

959
00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.370
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

960
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:15.850
<v Speaker 3>well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is reality.</v>

961
00:46:15.851 --> 00:46:18.040
<v Speaker 3>Now if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't provide these bathrooms,</v>

962
00:46:18.041 --> 00:46:18.874
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to get your 11 cents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do they have to have a third </v>

963
00:46:21.221 --> 00:46:22.150
<v Speaker 3>bathroom?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that the,</v>

964
00:46:22.151 --> 00:46:25.540
<v Speaker 3>it was that this well make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make accommodation.</v>

965
00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:30.310
<v Speaker 3>Now this perfect example is they say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have to do a,</v>

966
00:46:30.311 --> 00:46:31.330
<v Speaker 3>b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>c and d,</v>

967
00:46:31.331 --> 00:46:35.470
<v Speaker 3>Use the transgender bathroom as the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the latest and greatest front page.</v>

968
00:46:35.471 --> 00:46:37.720
<v Speaker 3>Here's what the federal government is </v>
<v Speaker 3>requiring,</v>

969
00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:43.080
<v Speaker 3>but it costs you as a state 15 cents to </v>
<v Speaker 3>deliver on getting the 11 cents.</v>

970
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:46.480
<v Speaker 3>It actually is a negative to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>federal money.</v>

971
00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.900
<v Speaker 3>So abolishing the Federal Department of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Education,</v>

972
00:46:49.901 --> 00:46:54.730
<v Speaker 3>which I think people think was </v>
<v Speaker 3>established under George Washington when</v>

973
00:46:54.731 --> 00:46:57.700
<v Speaker 3>it was established under Jimmy Carter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

974
00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.593
<v Speaker 3>tell me what really has been value added</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to the Federal Department </v>

975
00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:03.790
<v Speaker 3>of Education since,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

976
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:05.850
<v Speaker 3>since the 80s.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when it was him,</v>

977
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.090
<v Speaker 4>well let's talk about that one step </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it,</v>

978
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:08.933
<v Speaker 4>is there any benefit at all to being </v>
<v Speaker 4>open minded and trying to get people to </v>

979
00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:16.530
<v Speaker 4>discriminate against transgender people </v>
<v Speaker 4>last,</v>

980
00:47:16.531 --> 00:47:21.030
<v Speaker 4>or is this some sort of a political hot </v>
<v Speaker 4>topic that the government has latched on</v>

981
00:47:21.031 --> 00:47:21.864
<v Speaker 4>to try to get people to think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're progressive and they're moving </v>

982
00:47:24.661 --> 00:47:26.640
<v Speaker 4>towards the right direction?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I mean,</v>

983
00:47:26.641 --> 00:47:28.080
<v Speaker 4>how many people are we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

984
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:29.350
<v Speaker 4>it's the latter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

985
00:47:29.351 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been</v>

986
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.640
<v Speaker 3>a nonissue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not been an issue our entire lives</v>

987
00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.480
<v Speaker 4>for certain individuals in certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>environments</v>

988
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.330
<v Speaker 3>and they've been accommodating </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves this whole time throughout,</v>

989
00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:42.800
<v Speaker 3>throughout our lifetimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

990
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:44.623
<v Speaker 3>there should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's absolute a heightened </v>

991
00:47:46.991 --> 00:47:48.130
<v Speaker 3>awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

992
00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:49.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

993
00:47:49.361 --> 00:47:51.400
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is overkill.</v>

994
00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:53.170
<v Speaker 3>This should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this should be an issue that,</v>

995
00:47:53.171 --> 00:47:54.004
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Los Angeles deals with the state of </v>

996
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:56.223
<v Speaker 3>California deal.</v>

997
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:57.263
<v Speaker 4>Correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause we were actually discussing this </v>

998
00:47:58.770 --> 00:47:59.603
<v Speaker 4>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe what North Carolina has said </v>

999
00:48:00.721 --> 00:48:01.554
<v Speaker 4>was that you have to use the bathroom </v>
<v Speaker 4>that corresponds to the gender on your </v>

1000
00:48:03.631 --> 00:48:04.860
<v Speaker 4>birth certificate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

1001
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.200
<v Speaker 4>if Gary Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you decide at 50,</v>

1002
00:48:07.201 --> 00:48:08.034
<v Speaker 4>how old are you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sir?</v>

1003
00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.413
<v Speaker 4>63 63 if you decide at 63 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to be a woman that's a Bruce </v>

1004
00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.190
<v Speaker 4>Jenner did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1005
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:14.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you decide you want to be a woman,</v>

1006
00:48:14.551 --> 00:48:15.384
<v Speaker 4>you could change your birth certificate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your birth certificate literally can be </v>

1007
00:48:17.401 --> 00:48:19.710
<v Speaker 4>changed to say that you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can use the women's room.</v>

1008
00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:24.840
<v Speaker 4>So that's all they're requiring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this up in arms is really like,</v>

1009
00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:25.733
<v Speaker 4>they want it commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think before you decide to go and use </v>

1010
00:48:29.251 --> 00:48:30.084
<v Speaker 4>the women's room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you literally have to just go and </v>

1011
00:48:31.831 --> 00:48:34.590
<v Speaker 4>get your paperwork changed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that correct?</v>

1012
00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:36.501
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1013
00:48:36.501 --> 00:48:38.380
<v Speaker 3>I no disagreement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm,</v>

1014
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:40.370
<v Speaker 3>am I am a correct technically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1015
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:42.170
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is what they're requiring.</v>

1016
00:48:42.171 --> 00:48:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I think of of that bullshit,</v>

1017
00:48:46.161 --> 00:48:46.994
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a over an issue that has never been an </v>

1018
00:48:49.701 --> 00:48:52.660
<v Speaker 3>issue before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As governor of New Mexico Joe,</v>

1019
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:53.503
<v Speaker 3>I may have vetoed more legislation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other 49 governors in the country </v>

1020
00:48:57.321 --> 00:48:59.300
<v Speaker 3>combined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's this coming from?</v>

1021
00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:01.450
<v Speaker 3>Where's it coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I,</v>

1022
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:02.001
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1023
00:49:02.001 --> 00:49:02.834
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1024
00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:06.800
<v Speaker 3>it's discrimination against the lbgt </v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

1025
00:49:06.801 --> 00:49:11.240
<v Speaker 3>That's the heart of all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As governor of North Carolina,</v>

1026
00:49:11.241 --> 00:49:13.190
<v Speaker 3>if I had had been governor of North </v>
<v Speaker 3>Carolina,</v>

1027
00:49:13.191 --> 00:49:17.000
<v Speaker 3>I'd have vetoed that legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is much to do about nothing.</v>

1028
00:49:17.001 --> 00:49:19.410
<v Speaker 3>This is not an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1029
00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:20.533
<v Speaker 3>and certainly the federal government </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be stepping in and doing this </v>

1030
00:49:23.391 --> 00:49:26.990
<v Speaker 3>because North Carolina right now is </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering the wrath,</v>

1031
00:49:26.991 --> 00:49:29.090
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the whole country that says,</v>

1032
00:49:29.091 --> 00:49:29.924
<v Speaker 3>we're going to boycott North Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have nothing to do with </v>

1033
00:49:31.911 --> 00:49:35.840
<v Speaker 3>North Carolina as a result of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>having passed this legislation.</v>

1034
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:36.723
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're saying in passing this </v>

1035
00:49:38.501 --> 00:49:39.334
<v Speaker 4>legislation is not that complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just saying that you have to </v>

1036
00:49:42.401 --> 00:49:44.200
<v Speaker 4>change your gender on your birth </v>
<v Speaker 4>certificate.</v>

1037
00:49:44.201 --> 00:49:45.550
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1038
00:49:45.551 --> 00:49:46.384
<v Speaker 4>it may be discriminatory at heart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you look at the actual </v>

1039
00:49:50.051 --> 00:49:52.480
<v Speaker 4>paperwork,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what's required in order to use the</v>

1040
00:49:52.481 --> 00:49:53.314
<v Speaker 4>women's room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's not saying that you have to </v>

1041
00:49:55.121 --> 00:49:57.910
<v Speaker 4>have an x,</v>
<v Speaker 4>y chromosome to use the men's room.</v>

1042
00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:01.360
<v Speaker 4>They're saying you have to identify as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>male on your birth certificate.</v>

1043
00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:04.570
<v Speaker 4>So if a woman decides to become a man of</v>
<v Speaker 4>transition to a man,</v>

1044
00:50:04.571 --> 00:50:07.630
<v Speaker 4>she decided she's a man at heart and she</v>
<v Speaker 4>changes that under birth certificate.</v>

1045
00:50:07.631 --> 00:50:08.464
<v Speaker 4>They don't do a chromosomal test on her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's just a matter of a paperwork </v>

1046
00:50:11.081 --> 00:50:12.190
<v Speaker 4>change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

1047
00:50:12.191 --> 00:50:13.024
<v Speaker 4>I'm not really sure how much less you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could require of someone to use a </v>

1048
00:50:18.161 --> 00:50:21.370
<v Speaker 4>different bathroom that corresponds to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the gender of their birth.</v>

1049
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just,</v>

1050
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:25.783
<v Speaker 3>I would just disagree that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government taken a role here that I </v>

1051
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:31.140
<v Speaker 3>agree we never had to be established.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1052
00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:32.093
<v Speaker 4>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you do want to discourage </v>

1053
00:50:33.751 --> 00:50:36.270
<v Speaker 4>discriminate against discrimination </v>
<v Speaker 4>against transgender people,</v>

1054
00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:40.830
<v Speaker 4>how would you go about encouraging that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or is that just a social issue,</v>

1055
00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:43.080
<v Speaker 4>social issue that needs to be worked out</v>
<v Speaker 4>with people?</v>

1056
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:43.911
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1057
00:50:43.911 --> 00:50:45.980
<v Speaker 3>it's an issue that needs to be worked </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1058
00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:48.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>municipality state wide.</v>

1059
00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:49.520
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1060
00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:51.180
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1061
00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:54.830
<v Speaker 3>this issue has existed our entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetimes.</v>

1062
00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:58.730
<v Speaker 3>And have there been any reported </v>
<v Speaker 3>incidents of anything anywhere?</v>

1063
00:50:58.731 --> 00:51:00.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm not aware of any incidents any,</v>

1064
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:01.673
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's been something and I'm </v>

1065
00:51:02.161 --> 00:51:04.050
<v Speaker 4>sure some people feel maligned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1066
00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't know if necessarily there's</v>

1067
00:51:06.841 --> 00:51:11.841
<v Speaker 4>enough demand to require a law change </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what all this Hullabaloo is about,</v>

1068
00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:15.460
<v Speaker 4>about this law change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I discuss it with people and I'm,</v>

1069
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:16.703
<v Speaker 4>I try to be as open minded as humanly </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible when it comes to people's </v>

1070
00:51:20.401 --> 00:51:21.234
<v Speaker 4>choices and what they want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's regarding gender or sex or </v>

1071
00:51:23.431 --> 00:51:24.480
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me Too.</v>

1072
00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:25.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1073
00:51:25.591 --> 00:51:27.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my,</v>

1074
00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:28.053
<v Speaker 4>my issue with this is I feel like it's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>chance for people to jump up and say </v>

1075
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:33.833
<v Speaker 4>that they're outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's almost like a recreational </v>

1076
00:51:36.271 --> 00:51:38.130
<v Speaker 4>outreach thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I heard that Bruce springsteen</v>

1077
00:51:38.131 --> 00:51:40.680
<v Speaker 4>was boycotting North Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these people jumping up and like,</v>

1078
00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.620
<v Speaker 4>is that really the way to go about this?</v>

1079
00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:44.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

1080
00:51:44.791 --> 00:51:46.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is the way to go about it.</v>

1081
00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:47.163
<v Speaker 4>Just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're saying it in terms of like </v>

1082
00:51:48.681 --> 00:51:51.890
<v Speaker 4>government's gotten too big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to stop this law?</v>

1083
00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way to go about is to boycott.</v>

1084
00:51:53.821 --> 00:51:56.130
<v Speaker 3>The still way to go about it is boy cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stage,</v>

1085
00:51:56.131 --> 00:51:56.964
<v Speaker 3>just like a happened in Arizona when Jan</v>
<v Speaker 3>brewer started to talk about vilifying </v>

1086
00:52:00.901 --> 00:52:01.734
<v Speaker 3>Mexican immigration and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and conventions and the whole country </v>

1087
00:52:06.301 --> 00:52:09.240
<v Speaker 3>was boycotting Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when it came to,</v>

1088
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1089
00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:11.190
<v Speaker 3>traveling there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1090
00:52:11.191 --> 00:52:12.630
<v Speaker 3>it happened right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1091
00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.310
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and because of that,</v>

1092
00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:14.911
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1093
00:52:14.911 --> 00:52:16.990
<v Speaker 3>the change took place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Carolina,</v>

1094
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:17.833
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>

1095
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:19.343
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so really what's unnecessary in your </v>

1096
00:52:21.091 --> 00:52:22.740
<v Speaker 4>eyes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a small government guy.</v>

1097
00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:23.603
<v Speaker 4>What's unnecessary?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is the government getting involved at </v>

1098
00:52:24.811 --> 00:52:25.090
<v Speaker 4>all</v>

1099
00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:26.080
<v Speaker 3>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all?</v>

1100
00:52:26.081 --> 00:52:28.210
<v Speaker 3>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and don't get me wrong,</v>

1101
00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:32.350
<v Speaker 3>government has a fundamental role to </v>
<v Speaker 3>protect us against individuals,</v>

1102
00:52:32.351 --> 00:52:33.670
<v Speaker 3>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>corporations,</v>

1103
00:52:33.671 --> 00:52:35.770
<v Speaker 3>foreign governments that would do us </v>
<v Speaker 3>harm.</v>

1104
00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:37.490
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1105
00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:39.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm running for president of United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

1106
00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:41.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to think that a,</v>

1107
00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:42.970
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>

1108
00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:46.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to sign on to anything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes things better.</v>

1109
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:47.823
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>transgender law in front of me as </v>

1110
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:53.470
<v Speaker 3>governor and the state of North Carolina</v>
<v Speaker 3>or president of United States.</v>

1111
00:52:53.471 --> 00:52:54.850
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you make that analysis.</v>

1112
00:52:54.851 --> 00:52:55.684
<v Speaker 3>Is this going to make things better or </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the day is it just going </v>

1113
00:52:57.881 --> 00:52:58.714
<v Speaker 3>to add time and money to our lives and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not really do anything to plays devil's </v>

1114
00:53:02.711 --> 00:53:05.710
<v Speaker 3>advocate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any benefit in having it in the</v>

1115
00:53:05.711 --> 00:53:08.420
<v Speaker 3>news is any benefit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1116
00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.230
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people,</v>

1117
00:53:10.231 --> 00:53:10.870
<v Speaker 3>you'll</v>

1118
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:12.910
<v Speaker 4>become more and more aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1119
00:53:12.911 --> 00:53:16.930
<v Speaker 4>I think whether or not you look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>Caitlyn Jenner as a,</v>

1120
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:20.530
<v Speaker 4>a real issue in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what the issue is is that people</v>

1121
00:53:20.531 --> 00:53:21.364
<v Speaker 4>were becoming more aware that there are </v>
<v Speaker 4>folks out there that don't necessarily </v>

1122
00:53:23.591 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 4>fit necessarily with our standard</v>

1123
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:28.680
<v Speaker 5>idea of what gender is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

1124
00:53:28.681 --> 00:53:30.210
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all over the place.</v>

1125
00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:33.210
<v Speaker 5>There's people on the far right and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>far left just like politically.</v>

1126
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.050
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

1127
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:35.610
<v Speaker 5>And a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the end of the day,</v>

1128
00:53:35.611 --> 00:53:38.340
<v Speaker 5>aren't most of us absolutely tolerant of</v>
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>

1129
00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:39.650
<v Speaker 5>Most of us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:41.670
<v Speaker 5>And then people start there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The real issue,</v>

1131
00:53:41.671 --> 00:53:42.240
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.073
<v Speaker 5>The people that are intolerant of other </v>
<v Speaker 5>people's choices that don't affect you </v>

1133
00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:45.924
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the intolerant folks are the ones </v>

1134
00:53:47.821 --> 00:53:50.190
<v Speaker 5>that are passing this legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1135
00:53:50.191 --> 00:53:52.800
<v Speaker 5>So the intolerant ones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ones who are saying enough is enough</v>

1136
00:53:52.801 --> 00:53:56.340
<v Speaker 5>with all this transgender nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't use the women's room if you're</v>

1137
00:53:56.341 --> 00:53:58.740
<v Speaker 5>a man much to do about and nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 5>the seed.</v>

1138
00:53:58.741 --> 00:54:00.660
<v Speaker 5>There's some men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1139
00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:01.890
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so,</v>

1140
00:54:01.891 --> 00:54:06.150
<v Speaker 5>it's so confusing in some ways because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were as outliers on both sides.</v>

1141
00:54:06.151 --> 00:54:10.080
<v Speaker 5>Like I have met transgender women who </v>
<v Speaker 5>without a doubt,</v>

1142
00:54:10.081 --> 00:54:11.160
<v Speaker 5>I would consider them a woman.</v>

1143
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks like a woman.</v>

1144
00:54:12.271 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 5>She talks like a woman has sensibility </v>
<v Speaker 5>is like a woman dresses like a woman.</v>

1145
00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:16.620
<v Speaker 5>Whatever the fuck that means.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1146
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:17.783
<v Speaker 5>But then on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen there's this guy that </v>

1147
00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:20.903
<v Speaker 5>identified,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were talking about this guy recently </v>

1148
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:23.970
<v Speaker 5>identifies as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has a beard,</v>

1149
00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:26.190
<v Speaker 5>a has a penis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't want to have a sex change,</v>

1150
00:54:26.191 --> 00:54:28.020
<v Speaker 5>doesn't take hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>identifies as a woman.</v>

1151
00:54:28.021 --> 00:54:28.854
<v Speaker 5>Once it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we use the women's room and he's been </v>

1152
00:54:30.301 --> 00:54:31.510
<v Speaker 5>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1153
00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:33.340
<v Speaker 5>no he hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he wants to.</v>

1154
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:36.420
<v Speaker 5>And it was one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an outlier.</v>

1155
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:37.980
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with,</v>

1156
00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:41.070
<v Speaker 5>there's all sorts of people when any </v>
<v Speaker 5>issue like this comes up,</v>

1157
00:54:41.071 --> 00:54:42.840
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're going to have rational,</v>

1158
00:54:42.841 --> 00:54:44.160
<v Speaker 5>logical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obvious choices.</v>

1159
00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.320
<v Speaker 5>And then you have like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you do with that guy choices</v>

1160
00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:50.750
<v Speaker 2>and where does that decision making best</v>
<v Speaker 2>lie,</v>

1161
00:54:50.751 --> 00:54:54.290
<v Speaker 2>that decision making best lies in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>municipality,</v>

1162
00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:56.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where that person lives.</v>

1163
00:54:56.301 --> 00:54:57.134
<v Speaker 2>And if it's an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say an albuquerque and I'm the </v>

1164
00:54:58.941 --> 00:55:01.160
<v Speaker 2>mayor of Albuquerque,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1165
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:03.523
<v Speaker 2>welcome to come into the boys room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're welcome to come into the boys </v>

1166
00:55:07.161 --> 00:55:10.310
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boys room can be labeled transgender and</v>

1167
00:55:10.311 --> 00:55:12.050
<v Speaker 2>boy's room as far as I'm concerned.</v>

1168
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:15.970
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the only worry there would be if they</v>

1169
00:55:15.971 --> 00:55:18.100
<v Speaker 5>went into the boys room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were discriminated against,</v>

1170
00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:23.400
<v Speaker 5>but then show how many people going the </v>
<v Speaker 5>males</v>

1171
00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.401
<v Speaker 2>boys room though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1172
00:55:24.401 --> 00:55:25.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it'd be less of an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

1173
00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:27.790
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is knee jerk of course.</v>

1174
00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:28.751
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1175
00:55:28.751 --> 00:55:30.370
<v Speaker 2>and it's based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1176
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.840
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's have,</v>

1177
00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:34.800
<v Speaker 2>instead of having a one size fits all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1178
00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:38.110
<v Speaker 2>how about let's work this out at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute lowest level.</v>

1179
00:55:38.111 --> 00:55:41.500
<v Speaker 2>We can work it out and maybe we'll come </v>
<v Speaker 2>to some real,</v>

1180
00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:44.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a monumental,</v>

1181
00:55:44.741 --> 00:55:45.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1182
00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:47.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>epiphany's on how to do this.</v>

1183
00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:48.783
<v Speaker 2>What would possibly be the epiphany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the problems with </v>

1184
00:55:50.591 --> 00:55:51.660
<v Speaker 2>this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1185
00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1186
00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:53.680
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1187
00:55:53.681 --> 00:55:54.514
<v Speaker 2>that's you and I thinking about this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had a municipalities thinking </v>

1188
00:55:57.701 --> 00:55:58.534
<v Speaker 2>about it all across the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them would come up with </v>

1189
00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:00.903
<v Speaker 2>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be some best practices that would </v>

1190
00:56:02.231 --> 00:56:04.450
<v Speaker 2>emerge from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would make sense for everyone.</v>

1191
00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:05.261
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1192
00:56:05.261 --> 00:56:07.570
<v Speaker 5>the all the only suggested than I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever heard.</v>

1193
00:56:07.571 --> 00:56:10.750
<v Speaker 5>That makes any sense at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it three bathroom rule like male,</v>

1194
00:56:10.751 --> 00:56:11.890
<v Speaker 5>female,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

1195
00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:12.851
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but male,</v>

1196
00:56:12.851 --> 00:56:14.080
<v Speaker 5>female and go for it.</v>

1197
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and imagine,</v>

1198
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:16.263
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine all schools in this country </v>

1199
00:56:18.951 --> 00:56:22.010
<v Speaker 2>having to be ref retrofitted with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>third bathroom.</v>

1200
00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:24.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking billion.</v>

1201
00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.530
<v Speaker 3>$100 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just guessing.</v>

1202
00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:27.730
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of money.</v>

1203
00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.460
<v Speaker 3>Let's just say a lot of money and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>federal government's going to give you a</v>

1204
00:56:30.461 --> 00:56:35.230
<v Speaker 3>11 cents for you to accomplish their 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>cents where the mandate.</v>

1205
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:36.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1206
00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.340
<v Speaker 5>I liked the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know why I liked the issue?</v>

1207
00:56:39.341 --> 00:56:41.890
<v Speaker 5>Cause it's so bizarre and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 5>answer.</v>

1208
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:44.780
<v Speaker 5>I love when something has no answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you just sit around going,</v>

1209
00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:45.633
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1210
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:48.580
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause people will take sides and they'll</v>

1211
00:56:48.581 --> 00:56:49.414
<v Speaker 5>run with their side and make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you think that their side is the only </v>

1212
00:56:52.151 --> 00:56:54.970
<v Speaker 5>solution whatsoever when there really </v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't an only solution.</v>

1213
00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:57.190
<v Speaker 5>Profound.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1214
00:56:57.191 --> 00:56:58.300
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a weird one,</v>

1215
00:56:58.301 --> 00:57:01.640
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're back this weekend back to fiddle.</v>

1216
00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:04.440
<v Speaker 5>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's something to fiddle with.</v>

1217
00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:05.293
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a fiddling sort of a </v>

1218
00:57:06.851 --> 00:57:09.790
<v Speaker 5>conversation because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's polarizing.</v>

1219
00:57:09.791 --> 00:57:11.410
<v Speaker 5>It's confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>

1220
00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm not right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not right.</v>

1221
00:57:13.031 --> 00:57:15.430
<v Speaker 5>There's no right on this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a weird thing.</v>

1222
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.800
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole transgender thing is weird.</v>

1223
00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:19.450
<v Speaker 5>It's very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1224
00:57:19.451 --> 00:57:20.284
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it even 1% of people that become </v>

1225
00:57:22.091 --> 00:57:23.410
<v Speaker 5>transgender?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I doubt it.</v>

1226
00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:28.540
<v Speaker 5>It's probably far less than it's 0.03% </v>
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>

1227
00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:29.790
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1228
00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:32.950
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a very small amount of 3% of 1%.</v>

1229
00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:34.630
<v Speaker 5>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very small amount.</v>

1230
00:57:34.631 --> 00:57:36.850
<v Speaker 5>It varies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So a mandate,</v>

1231
00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:37.620
<v Speaker 5>because</v>

1232
00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:38.453
<v Speaker 3>Hola kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of kids out of thousands of </v>

1233
00:57:40.501 --> 00:57:43.560
<v Speaker 3>students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of a cheesy way to look.</v>

1234
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:44.583
<v Speaker 5>And wouldn't it be better for everyone </v>
<v Speaker 5>if we just became more open minded and </v>

1235
00:57:48.371 --> 00:57:51.190
<v Speaker 5>more friendly and loving and let people </v>
<v Speaker 5>do whatever the fuck they want to do.</v>

1236
00:57:51.191 --> 00:57:51.740
<v Speaker 5>Let,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let the,</v>

1237
00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:54.160
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the man who identifies as a woman,</v>

1238
00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:55.360
<v Speaker 5>let them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1239
00:57:55.361 --> 00:57:57.220
<v Speaker 5>use the woman's room if he actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>looks like a woman.</v>

1240
00:57:57.221 --> 00:57:59.200
<v Speaker 5>But if you have a beard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe we should play aside and go,</v>

1241
00:57:59.201 --> 00:58:00.310
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can use the men's room.</v>

1242
00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:01.420
<v Speaker 5>Just your freaking people out.</v>

1243
00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:05.130
<v Speaker 3>You probably spent as much time or more </v>
<v Speaker 3>time than I have in Europe,</v>

1244
00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:07.890
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what the showers are.</v>

1245
00:58:07.891 --> 00:58:09.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>showers are men and women.</v>

1246
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:11.690
<v Speaker 3>It's men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bathrooms.</v>

1247
00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:14.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't shower in Europe and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic prison,</v>

1248
00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:15.953
<v Speaker 3>prison showers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You going to serve men and women </v>

1249
00:58:17.131 --> 00:58:18.270
<v Speaker 3>showers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1250
00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:19.133
<v Speaker 3>Open showers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These recreational facilities in </v>

1251
00:58:22.351 --> 00:58:24.740
<v Speaker 3>virtually every single,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1252
00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:28.830
<v Speaker 3>a mountain community in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Alps for example,</v>

1253
00:58:28.831 --> 00:58:31.110
<v Speaker 3>like skiing communities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they have open showers.</v>

1254
00:58:31.111 --> 00:58:31.891
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this case,</v>

1255
00:58:31.891 --> 00:58:32.724
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got,</v>

1256
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:35.430
<v Speaker 3>they've got the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got these marvelous,</v>

1257
00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:37.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>recreational facilities.</v>

1258
00:58:37.351 --> 00:58:41.430
<v Speaker 3>It seems like in every town and in those</v>
<v Speaker 3>towns,</v>

1259
00:58:41.431 --> 00:58:42.264
<v Speaker 3>you know you've got a swimming pool and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you got the showers and the showers are </v>

1260
00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:49.350
<v Speaker 3>men and women both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now as a person who has got,</v>

1261
00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.850
<v Speaker 3>there's no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no choice.</v>

1262
00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:53.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm back to Europe now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a really different,</v>

1263
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:57.600
<v Speaker 3>it's just this kind of a thing is not an</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue in Europe.</v>

1264
00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1265
00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:01.860
<v Speaker 3>that would require a gigantic cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>shift though.</v>

1266
00:59:01.861 --> 00:59:03.960
<v Speaker 3>We're very used to segregating male and </v>
<v Speaker 3>female,</v>

1267
00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:08.610
<v Speaker 3>but awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here it is.</v>

1268
00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:11.130
<v Speaker 3>We're spreading awareness that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shoot.</v>

1269
00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.230
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe,</v>

1270
00:59:13.231 --> 00:59:17.040
<v Speaker 3>they shower together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your wife has to shower with some dude.</v>

1271
00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:19.200
<v Speaker 3>Like trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not going to fly.</v>

1272
00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:21.620
<v Speaker 3>Well let that go and fly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It flies.</v>

1273
00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:24.090
<v Speaker 3>It flies in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of stuff flies and you're right,</v>

1274
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:27.710
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't fly over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might not necessarily be a good thing.</v>

1275
00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:30.800
<v Speaker 3>You can't trust American men with </v>
<v Speaker 3>American women in a shower together.</v>

1276
00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in Europe where you've grown up with</v>

1277
00:59:33.561 --> 00:59:36.080
<v Speaker 3>that your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there aren't any incidents.</v>

1278
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:37.760
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to grow up with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1279
00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:38.571
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1280
00:59:38.571 --> 00:59:40.580
<v Speaker 3>we haven't grown up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to change.</v>

1281
00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:41.453
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be even more ridiculous to </v>

1282
00:59:43.131 --> 00:59:45.110
<v Speaker 3>adjust the way children growing up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1283
00:59:45.111 --> 00:59:46.940
<v Speaker 3>listen kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's gonna shower together.</v>

1284
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:48.350
<v Speaker 3>Parents would freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be like,</v>

1285
00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:49.960
<v Speaker 3>what kind of government is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>J Well,</v>

1286
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:53.630
<v Speaker 3>Gary Johnson's a psychopath awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1287
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:58.220
<v Speaker 3>as you were talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just that people be aware that there are</v>

1288
00:59:58.221 --> 01:00:01.070
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of different ways of doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1289
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.353
<v Speaker 3>There's also drink drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we can go down several </v>

1290
01:00:04.671 --> 01:00:07.280
<v Speaker 3>cul-de-sacs here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in Europe,</v>

1291
01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:08.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1292
01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:12.020
<v Speaker 3>you can kids start drinking at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earliest of age.</v>

1293
01:00:12.021 --> 01:00:15.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean like as in four or five years old</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so and so.</v>

1294
01:00:15.651 --> 01:00:16.484
<v Speaker 3>They know what alcohol is from a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>young age and so they don't have near </v>

1295
01:00:20.301 --> 01:00:21.134
<v Speaker 3>the issues with alcohol abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They ended up getting their driver's </v>

1296
01:00:25.191 --> 01:00:28.940
<v Speaker 3>licenses at 21 but they can drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1297
01:00:28.941 --> 01:00:31.250
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the consent of their parents,</v>

1298
01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:32.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at four years old.</v>

1299
01:00:32.631 --> 01:00:37.631
<v Speaker 3>And so they understand the impact of </v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol and now they drive a 21 well,</v>

1300
01:00:37.791 --> 01:00:42.410
<v Speaker 3>here in this country you can drive at 14</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm 14</v>

1301
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.540
<v Speaker 4>in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's 15,</v>

1302
01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:47.700
<v Speaker 4>you get a learner's permit at 16 drivers</v>
<v Speaker 4>license.</v>

1303
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.360
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's close to New Mexico.</v>

1304
01:00:50.361 --> 01:00:53.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was 14 in New Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really 13.</v>

1305
01:00:53.031 --> 01:00:53.864
<v Speaker 3>I had that motorcycle license at 13.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could drive a motorcycle in New </v>

1306
01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:59.760
<v Speaker 3>Mexico at 13.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now as a person</v>

1307
01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:01.800
<v Speaker 4>governance state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1308
01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.753
<v Speaker 4>and you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens when someone gets an </v>

1309
01:01:05.191 --> 01:01:05.850
<v Speaker 4>office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1310
01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:08.160
<v Speaker 4>when Obama gets an office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he promises all these things,</v>

1311
01:01:08.161 --> 01:01:09.990
<v Speaker 4>gets an office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>changes almost everything.</v>

1312
01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:12.900
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are the hurdles,</v>

1313
01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:13.973
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are the differences between the </v>

1314
01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:15.504
<v Speaker 4>hurdles of someone who governs a state </v>
<v Speaker 4>versus someone who governs the United </v>

1315
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.153
<v Speaker 4>States?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how much more difficult is it to </v>

1316
01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:25.230
<v Speaker 4>change things?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like the United States is like,</v>

1317
01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:30.470
<v Speaker 4>like a gigantic ship that takes so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>effort to shift even slightly that these</v>

1318
01:01:32.281 --> 01:01:33.114
<v Speaker 4>presidents get out of office eight years</v>
<v Speaker 4>later exhausted looking like they've </v>

1319
01:01:36.391 --> 01:01:38.790
<v Speaker 4>aged 50 years and very little gets done.</v>

1320
01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.793
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1321
01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:43.920
<v Speaker 3>I think there is a silver bullet to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>system and I,</v>

1322
01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.960
<v Speaker 3>I hope I'm tying into what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1323
01:01:45.961 --> 01:01:46.794
<v Speaker 3>but I do think there's a silver bullet </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the system and that would be term </v>

1324
01:01:49.081 --> 01:01:50.020
<v Speaker 3>limits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1325
01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:53.070
<v Speaker 3>I think that for the most part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>politicians,</v>

1326
01:01:53.071 --> 01:01:57.580
<v Speaker 3>once they get an office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main concern is to stay in off.</v>

1327
01:01:57.610 --> 01:01:59.940
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you had term limits,</v>

1328
01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:04.440
<v Speaker 3>I think that people would do the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing as opposed to whatever it takes to</v>

1329
01:02:04.441 --> 01:02:07.530
<v Speaker 3>get to me for Congress and for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Senate Congress,</v>

1330
01:02:07.531 --> 01:02:09.780
<v Speaker 3>Senate shipping point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even anywhere,</v>

1331
01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:10.643
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1332
01:02:11.010 --> 01:02:13.050
<v Speaker 3>supreme court's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another topic,</v>

1333
01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.460
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but certainly elected office agreed that</v>

1334
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:20.370
<v Speaker 3>we have it for the president one have it</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all elected offices.</v>

1335
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:23.120
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm the best example of term </v>
<v Speaker 3>limits.</v>

1336
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.983
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoyed the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had the opportunity to serve for two </v>

1337
01:02:27.561 --> 01:02:29.090
<v Speaker 3>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

1338
01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:33.890
<v Speaker 3>in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pressed the limits term one,</v>

1339
01:02:33.891 --> 01:02:36.680
<v Speaker 3>but not to the point where I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get reelected.</v>

1340
01:02:36.681 --> 01:02:40.730
<v Speaker 3>And then when I get reelected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started off by saying,</v>

1341
01:02:40.731 --> 01:02:41.564
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's examine the drug war in this </v>

1342
01:02:43.011 --> 01:02:43.844
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started off by saying that the </v>

1343
01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:50.000
<v Speaker 3>marijuana should be legalized taking on </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I thought at the time was,</v>

1344
01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:54.140
<v Speaker 3>and it still remains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as one of those really fixable things</v>

1345
01:02:54.141 --> 01:02:56.300
<v Speaker 3>in our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1346
01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.610
<v Speaker 3>that would make the world a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

1347
01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:01.250
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because of term limits,</v>

1348
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:03.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was emboldened because I,</v>

1349
01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:04.813
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was getting out of office and there </v>

1350
01:03:05.901 --> 01:03:06.734
<v Speaker 3>was no return.</v>

1351
01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:08.240
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1352
01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:11.320
<v Speaker 5>what are your thoughts on all the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>recreational drugs?</v>

1353
01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:13.840
<v Speaker 5>Not just marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the more controversial ones,</v>

1354
01:03:13.841 --> 01:03:17.860
<v Speaker 5>like maybe cocaine or Psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lsd,</v>

1355
01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:18.790
<v Speaker 5>things along those lines.</v>

1356
01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:22.330
<v Speaker 3>So when I was governor of New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>

1357
01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1358
01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:26.710
<v Speaker 3>I went to Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oregon and judges in Portland,</v>

1359
01:03:26.711 --> 01:03:27.544
<v Speaker 3>Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were judges that wanted to meet </v>

1360
01:03:28.781 --> 01:03:29.614
<v Speaker 3>with me in Portland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I went to meet with these judges </v>

1361
01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:35.170
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't know what the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it was going to be about,</v>

1362
01:03:35.171 --> 01:03:37.840
<v Speaker 3>but it was six judges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Portland,</v>

1363
01:03:37.841 --> 01:03:40.990
<v Speaker 3>Oregon State district judges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I'm getting the wrong label.</v>

1364
01:03:40.991 --> 01:03:42.700
<v Speaker 3>But what they said was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

1365
01:03:42.701 --> 01:03:43.930
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>governor Johnson,</v>

1366
01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.460
<v Speaker 3>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're here to tell you,</v>

1367
01:03:45.461 --> 01:03:48.310
<v Speaker 3>we completely agree with everything it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you're saying,</v>

1368
01:03:48.311 --> 01:03:52.180
<v Speaker 3>but we would like to share with you some</v>
<v Speaker 3>stories here that,</v>

1369
01:03:52.181 --> 01:03:53.014
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you can pass on to others that </v>

1370
01:03:54.971 --> 01:03:57.970
<v Speaker 3>will allow others to better understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>the drug issue.</v>

1371
01:03:58.690 --> 01:04:01.960
<v Speaker 3>They said that the really horrible drug </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there as methamphetamine,</v>

1372
01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:02.883
<v Speaker 3>that people that use methamphetamine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really have their behavior altered </v>

1373
01:04:06.701 --> 01:04:07.900
<v Speaker 3>and not in a good way.</v>

1374
01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:10.540
<v Speaker 3>So it's really the Boogie drug out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1375
01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.790
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1376
01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:17.710
<v Speaker 3>methamphetamine is the best example that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can think of of a prohibition drug.</v>

1377
01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:21.550
<v Speaker 3>It exists because it's cheap and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>easy to make.</v>

1378
01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:23.680
<v Speaker 3>And what they said was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that,</v>

1379
01:04:23.681 --> 01:04:25.630
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not suggesting the following,</v>

1380
01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:26.883
<v Speaker 3>but if cocaine were legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people would be using cocaine </v>

1381
01:04:30.671 --> 01:04:35.290
<v Speaker 3>instead of methamphetamine without the </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative behavioral consequence.</v>

1382
01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:36.603
<v Speaker 3>And that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if the government were to tell the </v>

1383
01:04:39.641 --> 01:04:44.500
<v Speaker 3>truth when it comes to cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine puts holes in your heart.</v>

1384
01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:45.873
<v Speaker 3>People that use cocaine their entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives are stereotypically Whitney </v>

1385
01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.553
<v Speaker 3>Houston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the die before they're 50 because they </v>

1386
01:04:51.641 --> 01:04:53.770
<v Speaker 3>die of a heart attack from using </v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine.</v>

1387
01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:54.903
<v Speaker 3>Now will there still be people that will</v>
<v Speaker 3>use cocaine knowing that they might die </v>

1388
01:04:58.391 --> 01:04:59.720
<v Speaker 3>of a heart attack?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1389
01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.293
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there'd be less cocaine use if </v>

1390
01:05:03.851 --> 01:05:04.684
<v Speaker 3>people actually knew the truth and could</v>
<v Speaker 3>trust government when it comes to the </v>

1391
01:05:07.511 --> 01:05:08.344
<v Speaker 3>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just maintain that 90% of the drug </v>

1392
01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:13.270
<v Speaker 3>problem is prohibition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unrelated,</v>

1393
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:17.890
<v Speaker 3>not use related.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is not to discount the with use</v>

1394
01:05:17.891 --> 01:05:19.690
<v Speaker 3>and abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that should be the focus.</v>

1395
01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:23.230
<v Speaker 3>When you have 8,000 deaths a year in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this country,</v>

1396
01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:27.850
<v Speaker 3>8,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is staggeringly low due to cocaine</v>

1397
01:05:27.851 --> 01:05:31.180
<v Speaker 3>and heroin overdose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people will immediately say,</v>

1398
01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:32.014
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number is so low because it's </v>

1399
01:05:34.121 --> 01:05:36.180
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1400
01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:39.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can argue that if it were legal,</v>

1401
01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:42.320
<v Speaker 3>if quality quantity was known,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1402
01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:46.360
<v Speaker 3>it's arguable that those desks would </v>
<v Speaker 3>significantly decrease.</v>

1403
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:49.630
<v Speaker 3>Although there will always be people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that will commit suicide.</v>

1404
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:50.150
<v Speaker 3>Always</v>

1405
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:52.970
<v Speaker 4>be people that will push the limits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1406
01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:53.893
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're always going to have people that </v>

1407
01:05:54.381 --> 01:05:55.700
<v Speaker 4>abuse everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything,</v>

1408
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:56.511
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>

1409
01:05:56.511 --> 01:05:57.344
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're living in a culture that has </v>

1410
01:05:58.701 --> 01:06:01.490
<v Speaker 4>alcohol available at every block all </v>
<v Speaker 4>over the world.</v>

1411
01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:02.361
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere you go,</v>

1412
01:06:02.361 --> 01:06:03.194
<v Speaker 4>there's a restaurant or a bar or </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere that you can buy enough </v>

1413
01:06:05.991 --> 01:06:09.050
<v Speaker 4>alcohol to drink yourself to death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's readily available.</v>

1414
01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:12.830
<v Speaker 4>Yet when you consider the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that actually drink alcohol,</v>

1415
01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:13.670
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1416
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:16.490
<v Speaker 4>the low number of deaths is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible.</v>

1417
01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:20.480
<v Speaker 4>And it's because we're aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>effects of alcohol and it's pretty,</v>

1418
01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:23.810
<v Speaker 4>when you get a bottle of Jack Daniel's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is pretty consistent.</v>

1419
01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:24.750
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1420
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:28.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are 100,000 deaths a year that</v>

1421
01:06:28.711 --> 01:06:29.820
<v Speaker 3>are contributed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1422
01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:30.540
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1423
01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:31.373
<v Speaker 3>get contributed to alcohol consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not talking about drinking and </v>

1424
01:06:33.721 --> 01:06:34.554
<v Speaker 3>driving or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or violence committed under the alcohol </v>

1425
01:06:36.541 --> 01:06:37.260
<v Speaker 3>abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol,</v>

1426
01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.870
<v Speaker 3>alcohol abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Statistically,</v>

1427
01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:41.220
<v Speaker 3>no one dies</v>

1428
01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:42.173
<v Speaker 4>from marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was what I was going to get to </v>

1429
01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:46.410
<v Speaker 4>was that when you look at what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening in Colorado,</v>

1430
01:06:46.411 --> 01:06:47.244
<v Speaker 4>one of the more interesting things is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the lesson of violent crime and drunk </v>

1431
01:06:51.331 --> 01:06:52.164
<v Speaker 4>driving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are two effects that have dropped </v>

1432
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:56.370
<v Speaker 4>pretty drastically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>noticeably,</v>

1433
01:06:56.730 --> 01:07:00.570
<v Speaker 4>statistically because of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>legalization of marijuana that you would</v>

1434
01:07:00.571 --> 01:07:03.810
<v Speaker 4>reduce because of the legalization of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>less harmful,</v>

1435
01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:07.150
<v Speaker 4>more peaceful drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd reduce the effects of uh,</v>

1436
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:11.250
<v Speaker 4>what's right now a readily available and</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredibly prevalent drug.</v>

1437
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:12.833
<v Speaker 3>I have always maintained that legalizing</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana will make for a better planet </v>

1438
01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.210
<v Speaker 3>on the medicinal side of marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1439
01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:26.280
<v Speaker 3>marijuana products directly compete with</v>
<v Speaker 3>legal prescription drugs,</v>

1440
01:07:26.281 --> 01:07:27.114
<v Speaker 3>pain killers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants that statistically kill </v>

1441
01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:32.400
<v Speaker 3>100,000 people a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1442
01:07:32.790 --> 01:07:37.650
<v Speaker 3>no documented death due to marijuana on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the recreational side.</v>

1443
01:07:37.651 --> 01:07:38.484
<v Speaker 3>I've always maintained that legalizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana will lead to less overall </v>

1444
01:07:42.331 --> 01:07:43.164
<v Speaker 3>substance abuse because people are going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to find it as such a safer alternative </v>

1445
01:07:46.951 --> 01:07:50.010
<v Speaker 3>than everything else that's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Starting with alcohol,</v>

1446
01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:54.060
<v Speaker 3>the campaign to legalize marijuana in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado,</v>

1447
01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:55.173
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a campaign based on marijuana is </v>

1448
01:07:57.031 --> 01:07:59.100
<v Speaker 3>safer than alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Joe,</v>

1449
01:07:59.101 --> 01:07:59.934
<v Speaker 3>as you were pointing out all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>statistics that all the naysayers were </v>

1450
01:08:03.541 --> 01:08:06.840
<v Speaker 3>going to go south,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have gone have gone better.</v>

1451
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:08.563
<v Speaker 3>They're less traffic incidents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's less overall crime in the state </v>

1452
01:08:12.331 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 3>of Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado is vibrant and does</v>

1453
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:19.070
<v Speaker 2>it have to do with marijuana?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's an ingredient,</v>

1454
01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:19.953
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comprised in why Colorado is so vibrant </v>

1455
01:08:22.581 --> 01:08:23.414
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1456
01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.150
<v Speaker 4>Question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blame,</v>

1457
01:08:24.150 --> 01:08:24.983
<v Speaker 4>unquestionable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think a prime example of how </v>

1458
01:08:27.730 --> 01:08:28.563
<v Speaker 4>screwy the system gets when people lobby</v>
<v Speaker 4>against the legalization of things that </v>

1459
01:08:33.481 --> 01:08:34.314
<v Speaker 4>don't harm anyone is the fact that hemp </v>
<v Speaker 4>is illegal federally and that we're </v>

1460
01:08:38.641 --> 01:08:39.474
<v Speaker 4>trying to make it legal and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make it legal statewide and in various </v>

1461
01:08:42.541 --> 01:08:46.290
<v Speaker 4>states and start production of hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But hemp is not psychoactive.</v>

1462
01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.910
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

1463
01:08:48.150 --> 01:08:48.983
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can sell hemp products in this </v>

1464
01:08:51.181 --> 01:08:53.580
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they come from China.</v>

1465
01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.190
<v Speaker 4>My company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we buy it or my company on it.</v>

1466
01:08:56.191 --> 01:09:00.660
<v Speaker 4>We buy it from Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We buy hemp protein from Canada and they</v>

1467
01:09:00.661 --> 01:09:02.640
<v Speaker 4>can't grow it in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can import it,</v>

1468
01:09:02.641 --> 01:09:04.050
<v Speaker 4>but we can't grow it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>CBD,</v>

1469
01:09:04.051 --> 01:09:05.490
<v Speaker 4>CBD oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1470
01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.160
<v Speaker 4>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not psychoactive helps pain.</v>

1471
01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.760
<v Speaker 4>Very effective for people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not getting people hire,</v>

1472
01:09:10.761 --> 01:09:13.200
<v Speaker 4>it's not ruining lives is not doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

1473
01:09:13.201 --> 01:09:14.034
<v Speaker 4>But there's a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>concerned that are making money off of </v>

1474
01:09:16.831 --> 01:09:19.050
<v Speaker 4>the alternatives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially with hemp.</v>

1475
01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:19.993
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the reason why marijuana was </v>

1476
01:09:20.881 --> 01:09:21.990
<v Speaker 4>made illegal in the first place.</v>

1477
01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:22.873
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason it was about hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conspiracy of dupont to promote </v>

1478
01:09:26.921 --> 01:09:29.590
<v Speaker 2>nylon as opposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1479
01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.290
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course they,</v>

1480
01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.490
<v Speaker 2>Randolph hearst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they per factories,</v>

1481
01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.720
<v Speaker 2>they made a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made a marijuana illegal,</v>

1482
01:09:37.721 --> 01:09:42.610
<v Speaker 2>but because the marijuana plant and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hemp plant look the same,</v>

1483
01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.040
<v Speaker 2>then hence hemp was also made illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1484
01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:46.874
<v Speaker 2>that was the,</v>

1485
01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:48.320
<v Speaker 4>the conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1486
01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:49.520
<v Speaker 4>Well that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1487
01:09:49.521 --> 01:09:50.810
<v Speaker 4>that's all been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

1488
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:51.703
<v Speaker 4>we're in a strange time that it's 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still illegal getting slowly </v>

1489
01:09:56.121 --> 01:09:58.180
<v Speaker 4>starting to become legal and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>starting to,</v>

1490
01:09:58.370 --> 01:10:00.350
<v Speaker 4>I believe in Kentucky and a few other </v>
<v Speaker 4>states,</v>

1491
01:10:00.351 --> 01:10:01.184
<v Speaker 4>they're allowing farmers to profit off </v>
<v Speaker 4>of this incredibly vibrant plant that's </v>

1492
01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:07.700
<v Speaker 4>easy to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't require pesticides,</v>

1493
01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:12.880
<v Speaker 4>has a variety of uses as a textile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a commodity for food,</v>

1494
01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:17.030
<v Speaker 4>a full amino acid profile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes amazing clothes and making this</v>

1495
01:10:17.031 --> 01:10:18.830
<v Speaker 4>jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is made out of hemp.</v>

1496
01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:19.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1497
01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:20.820
<v Speaker 2>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1498
01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:24.140
<v Speaker 2>if the marijuana plant were discovered </v>
<v Speaker 2>today in the Amazon,</v>

1499
01:10:24.141 --> 01:10:29.141
<v Speaker 2>it would be hailed as the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovery of humankind in 1999.</v>

1500
01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Good News.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bad News here.</v>

1501
01:10:32.451 --> 01:10:33.284
<v Speaker 2>In 1999 I was the highest elected </v>
<v Speaker 2>official in the United States to call </v>

1502
01:10:36.441 --> 01:10:40.550
<v Speaker 2>for the legalization of marijuana in </v>
<v Speaker 2>2016 bad news,</v>

1503
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:41.833
<v Speaker 2>I'm still the highest elected official </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the United States to call for the </v>

1504
01:10:44.181 --> 01:10:45.014
<v Speaker 2>legalization of marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although Bernie Sanders apparently </v>

1505
01:10:47.391 --> 01:10:49.400
<v Speaker 2>rolled out of bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit his head,</v>

1506
01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:52.400
<v Speaker 2>and now he's come to that same epiphany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful.</v>

1507
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:53.263
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in 1999 rolled out of bed and hit </v>

1508
01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:56.684
<v Speaker 2>his head aw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that he came to this epiphany at </v>

1509
01:10:58.941 --> 01:11:01.400
<v Speaker 2>this point in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's never said it before.</v>

1510
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:02.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1511
01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:05.930
<v Speaker 2>Not until he's been running for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Senate.</v>

1512
01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.830
<v Speaker 2>So you think it's like one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lick your finger,</v>

1513
01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.590
<v Speaker 2>put it up in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check where the breeze is going.</v>

1514
01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that he's joined the big crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1515
01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:14.243
<v Speaker 2>but in 1999,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30% of Americans supported legalizing </v>

1516
01:11:17.551 --> 01:11:18.384
<v Speaker 2>marijuana in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60% of Americans now are supporting the </v>

1517
01:11:22.891 --> 01:11:23.724
<v Speaker 2>legalization of marijuana and not one </v>
<v Speaker 2>politician outside of Bernie Sanders in </v>

1518
01:11:28.081 --> 01:11:30.030
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1519
01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.353
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I say elected official at the </v>

1520
01:11:33.391 --> 01:11:36.810
<v Speaker 2>congressional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>senatorial or gubernatorial level,</v>

1521
01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:40.620
<v Speaker 2>not one politician in that group outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Bernie Sanders,</v>

1522
01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.530
<v Speaker 2>myself have a spouse legalizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>

1523
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.480
<v Speaker 2>I think what a disconnect.</v>

1524
01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:46.383
<v Speaker 5>What an incredible disconnect between </v>
<v Speaker 5>what people think and our elected </v>

1525
01:11:49.451 --> 01:11:50.330
<v Speaker 5>officials.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1526
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:54.180
<v Speaker 5>it's also because when people take a </v>
<v Speaker 5>stand on something that's controversial,</v>

1527
01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.033
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's risky and politics are about </v>

1528
01:11:57.251 --> 01:11:59.800
<v Speaker 5>minimizing risk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about getting people to like you as</v>

1529
01:11:59.801 --> 01:12:00.634
<v Speaker 5>much as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>going down the middle as much as </v>

1530
01:12:02.321 --> 01:12:04.420
<v Speaker 5>possible term limits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>term limits.</v>

1531
01:12:04.421 --> 01:12:07.210
<v Speaker 5>I want to stay in office more than I </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to do the right thing.</v>

1532
01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:08.373
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that ultimately the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 5>having one individual that's the </v>

1533
01:12:11.531 --> 01:12:13.900
<v Speaker 5>figurehead of an entire nation is </v>
<v Speaker 5>archaic?</v>

1534
01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:15.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1535
01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:16.800
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1536
01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.270
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1537
01:12:18.271 --> 01:12:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is our system perfect?</v>

1538
01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:23.543
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1539
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:24.340
<v Speaker 2>but is it</v>

1540
01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.173
<v Speaker 5>perhaps the best system?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if we woke up to today and there was </v>

1541
01:12:27.851 --> 01:12:28.684
<v Speaker 5>no government at all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you think that we would possibly </v>

1542
01:12:32.050 --> 01:12:34.630
<v Speaker 5>create one guy that runs the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing?</v>

1543
01:12:34.631 --> 01:12:35.464
<v Speaker 5>We would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we would agree that that would be the </v>

1544
01:12:36.311 --> 01:12:37.300
<v Speaker 5>best way to run things.</v>

1545
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a theory that the best way to run</v>

1546
01:12:40.351 --> 01:12:41.640
<v Speaker 2>things would be that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1547
01:12:41.641 --> 01:12:42.474
<v Speaker 2>every 16 years we would have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>benevolent dictator takeover for two </v>

1548
01:12:45.931 --> 01:12:48.450
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what would happen,</v>

1549
01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:51.120
<v Speaker 2>and those are the days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other 14 years,</v>

1550
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:52.170
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other six,</v>

1551
01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:53.153
<v Speaker 2>16 years you'd have elected officials </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then for two years you'd have a </v>

1552
01:12:56.411 --> 01:13:00.330
<v Speaker 2>benevolent dictator step in and right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the wrongs that,</v>

1553
01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:04.740
<v Speaker 2>but of course the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is well then how do you,</v>

1554
01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.070
<v Speaker 2>how not sizeable someone could fake </v>
<v Speaker 2>being benevolent,</v>

1555
01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:11.780
<v Speaker 2>trying to be funny here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but trying to bring out a point that,</v>

1556
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:12.763
<v Speaker 2>that actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you could have that benevolent </v>

1557
01:13:14.701 --> 01:13:19.350
<v Speaker 2>dictator step in and right the wrongs </v>
<v Speaker 2>that elect,</v>

1558
01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:22.410
<v Speaker 2>we don't live in a democracy in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

1559
01:13:22.411 --> 01:13:26.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not a democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in a constitutional republic.</v>

1560
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:29.280
<v Speaker 2>We are a republic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were governed by laws.</v>

1561
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:30.143
<v Speaker 2>The laws are the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We democratically elect our </v>

1562
01:13:33.901 --> 01:13:36.210
<v Speaker 2>representatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in a democracy,</v>

1563
01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:40.000
<v Speaker 2>the demise of every democracy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

1564
01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:42.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some point in a democracy,</v>

1565
01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:46.170
<v Speaker 2>people vote themselves a raise and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes unaffordable.</v>

1566
01:13:46.710 --> 01:13:47.543
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazi Germany was a democracy before it </v>

1567
01:13:49.831 --> 01:13:52.230
<v Speaker 2>became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before Hitler took power.</v>

1568
01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:55.130
<v Speaker 5>So what would be the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1569
01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.450
<v Speaker 5>besides your 16 year to year benevolent </v>
<v Speaker 5>dictator,</v>

1570
01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:02.990
<v Speaker 5>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would be the way to fix the current</v>

1571
01:14:02.991 --> 01:14:05.600
<v Speaker 5>system?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like say if Gary Johnson gets an office,</v>

1572
01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:06.853
<v Speaker 5>what would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would be one of the first things </v>

1573
01:14:08.031 --> 01:14:08.864
<v Speaker 5>you did?</v>

1574
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.321
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1575
01:14:09.321 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 2>I do think that government is too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it tries to</v>

1576
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.720
<v Speaker 3>accomplish too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1577
01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:14.883
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1578
01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:20.010
<v Speaker 3>if at a minimum a Gary Johnson were able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to just put a cap on spending the,</v>

1579
01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:23.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the impact of that.</v>

1580
01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:25.480
<v Speaker 3>When you consider,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1581
01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:26.973
<v Speaker 3>when you consider the ultimate impact of</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflation and how that's going to kick </v>

1582
01:14:30.491 --> 01:14:33.910
<v Speaker 3>in and how that's going to so adversely </v>
<v Speaker 3>affect our lives,</v>

1583
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:37.330
<v Speaker 3>that would write a lot of wrongs because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do have economic growth.</v>

1584
01:14:37.331 --> 01:14:39.200
<v Speaker 3>You tie that with the fact that you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>put a,</v>

1585
01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:41.020
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to,</v>

1586
01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:41.913
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to put the most minimal bars </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there possible that would really </v>

1587
01:14:45.431 --> 01:14:48.670
<v Speaker 3>have a positive impact going forward </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a,</v>

1588
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:51.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for my financial standpoint.</v>

1589
01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:55.570
<v Speaker 3>And it isn't just financial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is about liberty and freedom.</v>

1590
01:14:55.571 --> 01:14:58.450
<v Speaker 3>It's about your liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about your freedom.</v>

1591
01:14:58.451 --> 01:15:01.210
<v Speaker 3>It's about you making decisions in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own lives.</v>

1592
01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:06.660
<v Speaker 3>It's about the fact that the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that crony capitalism is alive and well,</v>

1593
01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:08.044
<v Speaker 3>that there are favors granted to those </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have money as opposed to a level </v>

1594
01:15:12.431 --> 01:15:13.264
<v Speaker 3>playing field that everybody would </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually have an equal shot at the </v>

1595
01:15:17.081 --> 01:15:18.730
<v Speaker 3>opportunity that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1596
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:20.103
<v Speaker 3>that there currently is unavailable </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of government and the actual </v>

1597
01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:25.144
<v Speaker 3>protections that exist for those that do</v>
<v Speaker 3>have money as opposed to those that </v>

1598
01:15:28.961 --> 01:15:29.794
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

1599
01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:34.190
<v Speaker 4>So once you get into office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how would you go about minimizing</v>

1600
01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:35.550
<v Speaker 3>government?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1601
01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without any legislation whatsoever.</v>

1602
01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:39.533
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I am speaking now having been </v>

1603
01:15:41.671 --> 01:15:45.330
<v Speaker 3>governor in New Mexico for eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran all of state government.</v>

1604
01:15:45.331 --> 01:15:49.830
<v Speaker 3>I pointed the heads of all the agencies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And from that standpoint,</v>

1605
01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:52.800
<v Speaker 3>the idea was was just to make things </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

1606
01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.440
<v Speaker 3>And what's the definition of better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1607
01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:56.693
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the average person on the street would </v>

1608
01:15:58.921 --> 01:16:03.210
<v Speaker 3>have to spend less time and less money </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with government.</v>

1609
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:06.930
<v Speaker 3>And by spending less time and less money</v>
<v Speaker 3>on government,</v>

1610
01:16:06.931 --> 01:16:07.764
<v Speaker 3>that means that you would actually be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to pursue the things that were </v>

1611
01:16:10.321 --> 01:16:14.910
<v Speaker 3>important in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is not to minimize government's</v>

1612
01:16:14.911 --> 01:16:15.744
<v Speaker 3>role,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which fundamentally is to protect us </v>

1613
01:16:17.791 --> 01:16:19.920
<v Speaker 3>against individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>groups,</v>

1614
01:16:19.921 --> 01:16:22.100
<v Speaker 3>corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign governments that would</v>

1615
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:22.953
<v Speaker 4>do us harm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So going back to what we had discussed </v>

1616
01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:26.980
<v Speaker 4>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that when government gets too big,</v>

1617
01:16:26.981 --> 01:16:28.510
<v Speaker 4>you reach a point of diminishing </v>
<v Speaker 4>returns.</v>

1618
01:16:28.511 --> 01:16:32.050
<v Speaker 4>When it becomes to so swollen that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>requires so much money to stay up,</v>

1619
01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:33.580
<v Speaker 4>that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't,</v>

1620
01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:35.200
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't support itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

1621
01:16:35.210 --> 01:16:36.310
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets too large.</v>

1622
01:16:36.311 --> 01:16:37.144
<v Speaker 4>So what do you cut?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So say you get into office and you look </v>

1623
01:16:40.091 --> 01:16:40.924
<v Speaker 4>at the current system we have right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look at all the bureaucracy and the </v>

1624
01:16:43.421 --> 01:16:45.010
<v Speaker 4>red tape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you start to Chapo?</v>

1625
01:16:45.710 --> 01:16:46.543
<v Speaker 3>Well what I did in New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I said I would do this when I went </v>

1626
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:52.880
<v Speaker 3>in New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that I wasn't going to fire anybody,</v>

1627
01:16:52.881 --> 01:16:56.240
<v Speaker 3>but let's just manage attrition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just have some common sense here.</v>

1628
01:16:56.241 --> 01:16:57.074
<v Speaker 3>Let's not grow it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just at a minimum it's not going </v>

1629
01:17:00.161 --> 01:17:04.580
<v Speaker 3>to grow anymore and it will shrink </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there will be attrition.</v>

1630
01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:08.150
<v Speaker 3>So how about the notion of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as people leave,</v>

1631
01:17:08.151 --> 01:17:09.890
<v Speaker 3>as people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1632
01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:13.580
<v Speaker 3>quit retire that you just not backfill </v>
<v Speaker 3>those positions.</v>

1633
01:17:13.581 --> 01:17:18.530
<v Speaker 3>And as so when I left off us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were 1200 fewer state employees.</v>

1634
01:17:18.531 --> 01:17:19.364
<v Speaker 3>And when I got there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a testament to better </v>

1635
01:17:22.251 --> 01:17:25.130
<v Speaker 3>government because people were doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>

1636
01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:26.300
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1637
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:27.163
<v Speaker 3>with less resource.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think everybody saw that New </v>

1638
01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Mexico was a state that's two to one </v>
<v Speaker 3>democrat.</v>

1639
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:33.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made a name for myself,</v>

1640
01:17:33.891 --> 01:17:36.290
<v Speaker 3>pinching pennies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being frugal,</v>

1641
01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:38.960
<v Speaker 3>just like we're frugal in our lives at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least.</v>

1642
01:17:38.961 --> 01:17:40.130
<v Speaker 3>I certainly am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1643
01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:43.910
<v Speaker 3>difference between cheap and frugal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pretty frugal cat.</v>

1644
01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:48.340
<v Speaker 4>So what do you do with something that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>very controversial and often criticized?</v>

1645
01:17:48.341 --> 01:17:49.174
<v Speaker 4>Like Homeland Security?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there was an article that came out </v>

1646
01:17:50.891 --> 01:17:51.724
<v Speaker 4>yesterday about homeland security going </v>
<v Speaker 4>after the using homeland security to go </v>

1647
01:17:55.121 --> 01:17:59.950
<v Speaker 4>after massage parlors for uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>giving sex to people for,</v>

1648
01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:01.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>handjobs yeah,</v>

1649
01:18:01.570 --> 01:18:04.230
<v Speaker 3>I would have never in the f in the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

1650
01:18:04.231 --> 01:18:07.560
<v Speaker 3>I would have never established the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Department of Homeland Security.</v>

1651
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:09.350
<v Speaker 3>Now as president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1652
01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:12.300
<v Speaker 3>I either get to sign or veto </v>
<v Speaker 3>legislation,</v>

1653
01:18:12.330 --> 01:18:13.163
<v Speaker 3>I would sign legislation that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>abolish the Department of Homeland </v>

1654
01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:18.790
<v Speaker 3>Security or I would merge it with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>FBI.</v>

1655
01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:19.643
<v Speaker 3>Just think we do have too many agencies </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you hear about a story like </v>

1656
01:18:24.121 --> 01:18:26.790
<v Speaker 3>homeland security going into a massage </v>
<v Speaker 3>parlor,</v>

1657
01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:29.250
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just get outraged.</v>

1658
01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.180
<v Speaker 4>What causes that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what I wanted to get to.</v>

1659
01:18:32.181 --> 01:18:33.890
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does that happen?</v>

1660
01:18:33.891 --> 01:18:34.724
<v Speaker 4>How does homeland security,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's set up to prevent </v>

1661
01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:37.453
<v Speaker 4>terrorist attacks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How does it eventually get bastardized </v>

1662
01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:40.993
<v Speaker 4>and distorted to the point where they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>utilizing the legislation that was put </v>

1663
01:18:44.091 --> 01:18:44.924
<v Speaker 4>in place to protect people from </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrorist attacks to stop guys getting </v>

1664
01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:51.560
<v Speaker 4>handjobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's human nature.</v>

1665
01:18:51.561 --> 01:18:52.680
<v Speaker 4>It's the Peter Principle.</v>

1666
01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:55.860
<v Speaker 3>It's when you're assigned to a job in </v>
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>

1667
01:18:58.230 --> 01:19:02.160
<v Speaker 3>the more important you are is the more </v>
<v Speaker 3>work that you have.</v>

1668
01:19:02.161 --> 01:19:04.470
<v Speaker 3>So you literally create your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1669
01:19:04.530 --> 01:19:06.720
<v Speaker 3>you create the work that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1670
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.920
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1671
01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:10.440
<v Speaker 3>you try and expand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You try and grow.</v>

1672
01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the private sector,</v>

1673
01:19:12.211 --> 01:19:14.790
<v Speaker 3>not the public sector,</v>
<v Speaker 3>public sector.</v>

1674
01:19:15.090 --> 01:19:17.220
<v Speaker 3>People that get involved in the public </v>
<v Speaker 3>sector.</v>

1675
01:19:17.221 --> 01:19:20.730
<v Speaker 3>They think that success is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is growing their mandate.</v>

1676
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:21.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1677
01:19:21.810 --> 01:19:24.060
<v Speaker 3>it's that simple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but someone has to approve that.</v>

1678
01:19:24.090 --> 01:19:25.820
<v Speaker 3>Like someone has to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1679
01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:28.590
<v Speaker 3>after the massage parlors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sadly in this case,</v>

1680
01:19:28.591 --> 01:19:30.180
<v Speaker 3>where's the president of the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States,</v>

1681
01:19:30.181 --> 01:19:33.750
<v Speaker 3>the president of United States could </v>
<v Speaker 3>step into this in a nanosecond and say,</v>

1682
01:19:33.751 --> 01:19:35.220
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

1683
01:19:35.290 --> 01:19:36.123
<v Speaker 4>But is it possible that he's not aware </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it because you're looking at it is </v>

1684
01:19:38.591 --> 01:19:40.780
<v Speaker 4>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so many things to be aware of.</v>

1685
01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:42.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has governor of New Mexico.</v>

1686
01:19:42.791 --> 01:19:44.620
<v Speaker 3>Here's something I did as governor in </v>
<v Speaker 3>New Mexico on.</v>

1687
01:19:44.621 --> 01:19:45.454
<v Speaker 3>It's something I would do as president </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the United States as governor of New </v>

1688
01:19:48.490 --> 01:19:49.323
<v Speaker 3>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I set up this open door after four </v>

1689
01:19:50.711 --> 01:19:51.544
<v Speaker 3>policy where the third Thursday of every</v>
<v Speaker 3>month I saw anyone in the state of New </v>

1690
01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:57.573
<v Speaker 3>Mexico starting at four o'clock in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>afternoon until 10 o'clock at the </v>

1691
01:20:00.011 --> 01:20:02.950
<v Speaker 3>evening in the evening on five minute </v>
<v Speaker 3>increments.</v>

1692
01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:04.383
<v Speaker 3>And it was amazing Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stories of people that came in and </v>

1693
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:09.060
<v Speaker 3>what they had to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now they could come in for anything,</v>

1694
01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:10.083
<v Speaker 3>come in for a picture with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They come in to visit me with me for </v>

1695
01:20:12.361 --> 01:20:16.090
<v Speaker 3>five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could come in and talk about here's</v>

1696
01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:20.100
<v Speaker 3>a government atrocity that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me and I'd like you to fix it.</v>

1697
01:20:20.101 --> 01:20:21.960
<v Speaker 3>And I always viewed it from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>standpoint of,</v>

1698
01:20:21.961 --> 01:20:23.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is one person that's come in,</v>

1699
01:20:23.851 --> 01:20:24.540
<v Speaker 3>but you know what?</v>

1700
01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:28.410
<v Speaker 3>Everybody that's dealing with this same </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation is having the same outcomes as</v>

1701
01:20:28.411 --> 01:20:31.650
<v Speaker 3>this person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was an incredibly valuable tool.</v>

1702
01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.113
<v Speaker 3>As president of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would set up an open door after four </v>

1703
01:20:35.971 --> 01:20:40.170
<v Speaker 3>policy for atrocities in government for </v>
<v Speaker 3>a waste,</v>

1704
01:20:40.171 --> 01:20:41.004
<v Speaker 3>fraud and abuse atrocities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So door after four but you're talking </v>

1705
01:20:45.121 --> 01:20:48.960
<v Speaker 3>about 300 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1706
01:20:48.961 --> 01:20:49.794
<v Speaker 3>So we have an open door for five minutes</v>
<v Speaker 3>available for 300 million people in six </v>

1707
01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:54.820
<v Speaker 3>door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well this would,</v>

1708
01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:57.930
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this would be,</v>

1709
01:20:58.350 --> 01:21:01.350
<v Speaker 3>there would be a criteria for it and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be,</v>

1710
01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:02.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1711
01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:03.700
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1712
01:21:03.810 --> 01:21:06.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm certain I could make this happen,</v>

1713
01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:08.760
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm certain that,</v>

1714
01:21:08.761 --> 01:21:11.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think that's a great idea for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>governor.</v>

1715
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:14.820
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a better idea for a mayor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you get to a precedent,</v>

1716
01:21:15.150 --> 01:21:17.820
<v Speaker 3>is that really a way to what handles </v>
<v Speaker 3>some things?</v>

1717
01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:21.090
<v Speaker 3>So what is the mechanism?</v>

1718
01:21:21.090 --> 01:21:21.923
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying I think I can make this </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanism work that as a result of </v>

1719
01:21:25.081 --> 01:21:25.914
<v Speaker 3>having this mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to find out in a very short </v>

1720
01:21:28.201 --> 01:21:29.034
<v Speaker 3>amount of time that the Department of </v>
<v Speaker 3>homeland security is busting massage </v>

1721
01:21:31.861 --> 01:21:32.870
<v Speaker 3>parlors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna,</v>

1722
01:21:32.890 --> 01:21:33.723
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find that out just as easily through </v>

1723
01:21:35.161 --> 01:21:36.780
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1724
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:39.330
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm going to be connected that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way too.</v>

1725
01:21:39.331 --> 01:21:40.950
<v Speaker 3>But waste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fraud and abuse.</v>

1726
01:21:40.951 --> 01:21:41.784
<v Speaker 3>The Marine One helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was more thinking in terms of the </v>

1727
01:21:43.831 --> 01:21:48.831
<v Speaker 3>Marine One helicopter was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it was a contract that went from $4</v>

1728
01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:50.363
<v Speaker 3>billion to $16 billion without a single </v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopter being delivered because you </v>

1729
01:21:55.711 --> 01:21:57.210
<v Speaker 3>had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had,</v>

1730
01:21:57.211 --> 01:21:58.044
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the military a hierarchy on a committee </v>

1731
01:22:01.351 --> 01:22:02.184
<v Speaker 3>that determined that a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wanted this helicopter to be steel </v>

1732
01:22:05.251 --> 01:22:08.820
<v Speaker 3>instead of aluminum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was a boost of Westland.</v>

1733
01:22:08.821 --> 01:22:09.654
<v Speaker 3>And in a nutshell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come up with a completely </v>

1734
01:22:11.251 --> 01:22:13.980
<v Speaker 3>redesigned helicopter as opposed to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>original bid,</v>

1735
01:22:13.981 --> 01:22:15.420
<v Speaker 3>which was off the shelf.</v>

1736
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would have been 4 billion.</v>

1737
01:22:17.401 --> 01:22:19.540
<v Speaker 3>Now it's 16 billion and they haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1738
01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.330
<v Speaker 3>they haven't flown a helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1739
01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.490
<v Speaker 3>if you had a waste fraud and abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1740
01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.760
<v Speaker 3>open door after four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1741
01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:27.713
<v Speaker 3>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'd have known about it and I </v>

1742
01:22:28.441 --> 01:22:29.850
<v Speaker 3>would've stepped right in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1743
01:22:29.851 --> 01:22:30.684
<v Speaker 3>But is that waste fraud or abuse or is </v>
<v Speaker 3>it just innovation and the expenses </v>

1744
01:22:33.691 --> 01:22:37.310
<v Speaker 3>involved and changing a design.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the Pid,</v>

1745
01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:42.420
<v Speaker 3>the bid originally was for off the shelf</v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopters that they were building,</v>

1746
01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:43.853
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that there was going to be bolt on </v>

1747
01:22:45.061 --> 01:22:45.894
<v Speaker 3>avionics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the first thing that this military </v>

1748
01:22:48.391 --> 01:22:52.230
<v Speaker 3>procurement committee said was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't want an aluminum frame.</v>

1749
01:22:52.231 --> 01:22:55.950
<v Speaker 3>We want to steel frame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well steel frame that meant that,</v>

1750
01:22:55.951 --> 01:22:57.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>

1751
01:22:57.750 --> 01:23:00.900
<v Speaker 3>everything had to be redesigned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the engines had to be bigger.</v>

1752
01:23:00.901 --> 01:23:02.580
<v Speaker 3>The fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right,</v>

1753
01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:05.000
<v Speaker 3>so is that waste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would go into waste.</v>

1754
01:23:05.010 --> 01:23:06.280
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be fraud or abuse</v>

1755
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:09.630
<v Speaker 5>necessarily waste total to work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what,</v>

1756
01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.473
<v Speaker 5>where's the logic behind that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But as an engineering decision based on </v>

1757
01:23:13.210 --> 01:23:17.980
<v Speaker 5>like real knowledge that we have about </v>
<v Speaker 5>the rigidity of steel versus aluminum or</v>

1758
01:23:17.981 --> 01:23:18.814
<v Speaker 5>what does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does the,</v>

1759
01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:20.880
<v Speaker 5>she would think that a Gustaf Westland,</v>

1760
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:24.060
<v Speaker 2>a helicopter manufacturing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1761
01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:29.040
<v Speaker 2>business with an off the shelf Heloc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a helicopter that exists,</v>

1762
01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:30.173
<v Speaker 2>that existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the government want this </v>

1763
01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:37.140
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it transformed into a completely new</v>

1764
01:23:37.141 --> 01:23:38.760
<v Speaker 2>helicopter that has yet to fly.</v>

1765
01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:42.190
<v Speaker 5>That sounds insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's insane.</v>

1766
01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:43.660
<v Speaker 5>It is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's insane.</v>

1767
01:23:43.661 --> 01:23:45.520
<v Speaker 5>Is that there was originally agreed upon</v>
<v Speaker 5>without,</v>

1768
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean if they had like an order and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>initial order,</v>

1769
01:23:49.061 --> 01:23:49.894
<v Speaker 5>they had an initial order,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what was the reasoning for making the </v>

1770
01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:55.270
<v Speaker 5>steel frame?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was the reasoning for changing?</v>

1771
01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:56.500
<v Speaker 5>Did it that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1772
01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:57.790
<v Speaker 5>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1773
01:23:57.791 --> 01:23:58.624
<v Speaker 5>that the order then had to go to this </v>
<v Speaker 5>pure cureman committee for any tweaks </v>

1774
01:24:02.321 --> 01:24:05.530
<v Speaker 5>and you'd have to think that there are </v>
<v Speaker 5>tweaks,</v>

1775
01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:07.173
<v Speaker 5>but this wasn't a tweak as an enzyme </v>
<v Speaker 5>tweak that's redesigning an incredibly </v>

1776
01:24:10.241 --> 01:24:11.074
<v Speaker 5>new,</v>

1777
01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:14.920
<v Speaker 2>it's about as nutty as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flint water,</v>

1778
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:16.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1779
01:24:16.511 --> 01:24:18.280
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flint water crisis.</v>

1780
01:24:18.281 --> 01:24:19.114
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't I tell you what that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds about as a troche's as it gets </v>

1781
01:24:22.601 --> 01:24:25.150
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to government turning its </v>
<v Speaker 2>back on,</v>

1782
01:24:25.151 --> 01:24:27.460
<v Speaker 2>on an obvious situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about,</v>

1783
01:24:27.490 --> 01:24:28.323
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm reading about it and as governor </v>

1784
01:24:30.641 --> 01:24:31.474
<v Speaker 2>of New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you that residents from </v>

1785
01:24:33.821 --> 01:24:37.840
<v Speaker 2>flint would have been at my open door </v>
<v Speaker 2>after four saying,</v>

1786
01:24:37.841 --> 01:24:38.674
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got dirty water and I would have got </v>

1787
01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:43.480
<v Speaker 2>into the middle of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to think Joe,</v>

1788
01:24:43.481 --> 01:24:46.330
<v Speaker 2>that I would've gotten into the middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it immediately.</v>

1789
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:49.270
<v Speaker 2>But you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I didn't get into it immediately,</v>

1790
01:24:49.271 --> 01:24:52.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing my second door open door </v>
<v Speaker 2>after four,</v>

1791
01:24:52.450 --> 01:24:54.730
<v Speaker 2>instead of having four people show up </v>
<v Speaker 2>from flint,</v>

1792
01:24:54.731 --> 01:24:55.564
<v Speaker 2>would have 80 people showing up from </v>
<v Speaker 2>flint point is it would not have gone </v>

1793
01:24:59.771 --> 01:25:01.690
<v Speaker 2>unnoticed by me as governor.</v>

1794
01:25:01.690 --> 01:25:02.523
<v Speaker 2>And I had gotten right into the middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it and I had a mechanism for doing </v>

1795
01:25:05.291 --> 01:25:06.124
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there needs to be a mechanism for </v>

1796
01:25:07.601 --> 01:25:09.700
<v Speaker 2>the president of United States to stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>in touch.</v>

1797
01:25:09.970 --> 01:25:14.500
<v Speaker 2>The imperial presidency of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the notion that the president,</v>

1798
01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:17.150
<v Speaker 2>whenever the president travels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1799
01:25:17.170 --> 01:25:20.710
<v Speaker 2>it's tens of millions of dollars every </v>
<v Speaker 2>time he travels.</v>

1800
01:25:20.711 --> 01:25:22.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1801
01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:26.440
<v Speaker 2>if I'm elected president United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to change dramatically.</v>

1802
01:25:26.441 --> 01:25:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Does Air Force One really need to fly a </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere?</v>

1803
01:25:30.130 --> 01:25:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't think so.</v>

1804
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:35.290
<v Speaker 2>Why can't the prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States come into Los Angeles,</v>

1805
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.981
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

1806
01:25:35.981 --> 01:25:40.981
<v Speaker 2>in a very stealth way and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and travel without having to block a all</v>

1807
01:25:41.321 --> 01:25:42.154
<v Speaker 2>of traffic in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you have to f experience many </v>

1808
01:25:45.731 --> 01:25:46.160
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

1809
01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty gross.</v>

1810
01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:48.673
<v Speaker 5>Well also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why do they have to fly in Air Force </v>

1811
01:25:50.721 --> 01:25:52.220
<v Speaker 5>One?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How come they can't just get an American</v>

1812
01:25:52.221 --> 01:25:52.930
<v Speaker 5>airlines all</v>

1813
01:25:52.930 --> 01:25:56.200
<v Speaker 2>come well or how bout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how bout one of those?</v>

1814
01:25:56.201 --> 01:25:57.034
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about one of those corporate </v>

1815
01:25:57.701 --> 01:25:58.900
<v Speaker 2>aircraft that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1816
01:25:58.901 --> 01:25:59.734
<v Speaker 2>are in the military that would cost a </v>
<v Speaker 2>10th of what the Air Force One causes </v>

1817
01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 2>the benefits</v>

1818
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:04.933
<v Speaker 1>of Air Force One is air force one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a pod where the president </v>

1819
01:26:07.011 --> 01:26:08.290
<v Speaker 1>can parachute to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saves you.</v>

1820
01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:10.040
<v Speaker 1>They tried to shoot it down or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy like that.</v>

1821
01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.990
<v Speaker 1>You wonder about that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1822
01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:12.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about a,</v>

1823
01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.680
<v Speaker 1>what about an ejection seat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1824
01:26:15.681 --> 01:26:18.410
<v Speaker 1>James Bond's goes on and on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1825
01:26:18.490 --> 01:26:21.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can handle the objection.</v>

1826
01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.730
<v Speaker 1>You get handled being rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could handle being ejected.</v>

1827
01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm uncertain about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1828
01:26:28.791 --> 01:26:30.920
<v Speaker 1>we could go on and on about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of those lines,</v>

1829
01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.780
<v Speaker 1>it seems a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little silly,</v>

1830
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:33.883
<v Speaker 1>but it's a little silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing has become not just a </v>

1831
01:26:36.351 --> 01:26:38.840
<v Speaker 1>little silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's become pretty crazy.</v>

1832
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:39.763
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also when you isolate the president and </v>

1833
01:26:40.581 --> 01:26:41.414
<v Speaker 1>you make them this person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to shut down all the city </v>

1834
01:26:43.371 --> 01:26:44.204
<v Speaker 1>streets and bring in a gigantic parade </v>
<v Speaker 1>of storm troopers that have to stand by </v>

1835
01:26:49.611 --> 01:26:52.850
<v Speaker 1>his side and you know what it would be?</v>

1836
01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:53.773
<v Speaker 1>It'd be great to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as President United States to just </v>

1837
01:26:55.821 --> 01:26:56.654
<v Speaker 1>shuttle around in an f 16 I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>let him shoot me down and an f 16 I'll </v>

1838
01:26:59.841 --> 01:27:02.810
<v Speaker 1>just take the back seat and I'm speaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>now as well.</v>

1839
01:27:02.811 --> 01:27:05.420
<v Speaker 1>They don't go very far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that they don't go very far,</v>

1840
01:27:05.421 --> 01:27:08.540
<v Speaker 1>but they go really fast and when we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

1841
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:13.310
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about money and dollars as</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to have 16 Ra.</v>

1842
01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Actually it sounds like you just want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in enough 16 no,</v>

1843
01:27:17.551 --> 01:27:18.410
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to,</v>

1844
01:27:18.411 --> 01:27:19.244
<v Speaker 1>I just want to spend less money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a frugal cat in the White </v>

1845
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:22.783
<v Speaker 1>House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of odds do you think there </v>

1846
01:27:26.391 --> 01:27:27.320
<v Speaker 1>are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

1847
01:27:27.321 --> 01:27:30.170
<v Speaker 1>this election is a very tricky </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

1848
01:27:30.230 --> 01:27:35.230
<v Speaker 1>but what kind of odds do you believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are for 2020 I think,</v>

1849
01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:37.243
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would not be doing this if there </v>

1850
01:27:39.081 --> 01:27:39.914
<v Speaker 1>weren't the opportunity to win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the only opportunity that there is </v>

1851
01:27:43.371 --> 01:27:45.620
<v Speaker 1>of winning is to be in the presidential </v>
<v Speaker 1>debates.</v>

1852
01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:47.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the only chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1853
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:49.460
<v Speaker 1>what's the keys into the presidential </v>
<v Speaker 1>debates?</v>

1854
01:27:49.461 --> 01:27:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Kind of where we started off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be in the pole.</v>

1855
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:53.343
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that seem insane?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That what you have to get in this one </v>

1856
01:27:56.001 --> 01:27:56.834
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this presidential debates is thing that </v>

1857
01:27:58.191 --> 01:28:01.760
<v Speaker 1>is [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the reality.</v>

1858
01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1859
01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:03.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>

1860
01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe that's not the insane part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it?</v>

1861
01:28:07.551 --> 01:28:08.384
<v Speaker 1>Does it not seem logical that anyone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>can mathematically be elected president </v>

1862
01:28:13.971 --> 01:28:18.971
<v Speaker 1>in 2012 that would have included the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Libertarian Party and the Green Party?</v>

1863
01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:20.653
<v Speaker 1>Does it not seem logical that anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of being mathematically elected </v>

1864
01:28:26.091 --> 01:28:26.924
<v Speaker 1>president in United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>270 electoral votes should at a minimum </v>

1865
01:28:30.621 --> 01:28:34.370
<v Speaker 1>be included in the polls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there'd be a requirement that,</v>

1866
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:35.383
<v Speaker 1>and you know that I'm in a 2016 there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are like 1600 people that registered to </v>

1867
01:28:42.021 --> 01:28:45.110
<v Speaker 1>run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't Roseanne Barr one of them.</v>

1868
01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:46.071
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

1869
01:28:46.071 --> 01:28:46.904
<v Speaker 1>that was 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was 2012 but anybody can run for </v>

1870
01:28:51.231 --> 01:28:52.064
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to do is sign up with the </v>

1871
01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Federal Elections Commission and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>run for president.</v>

1872
01:28:55.641 --> 01:28:59.330
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2012 there were only four people that</v>

1873
01:28:59.331 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 1>could have mathematically been elected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that</v>

1874
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.903
<v Speaker 3>seem fair?</v>

1875
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:04.350
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't seem well,</v>

1876
01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:09.600
<v Speaker 5>the two party system is the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 5>hurdle right now for it.</v>

1877
01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:10.703
<v Speaker 5>I think most people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you think about the potential of </v>

1878
01:29:12.901 --> 01:29:13.734
<v Speaker 5>running for president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the biggest hurdle is that you have to </v>

1879
01:29:15.961 --> 01:29:19.080
<v Speaker 5>be accepted and you have to be the </v>
<v Speaker 5>nominee of one of these two parties,</v>

1880
01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:20.110
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1881
01:29:20.110 --> 01:29:23.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or that you'll be included in the polls.</v>

1882
01:29:23.021 --> 01:29:28.021
<v Speaker 3>And right now because of just how </v>
<v Speaker 3>polarizing hillary and a trump are,</v>

1883
01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:32.890
<v Speaker 3>that just being in the polls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that will register enough,</v>

1884
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:37.780
<v Speaker 3>a dissatisfaction with any third party </v>
<v Speaker 3>name in this case me.</v>

1885
01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:39.101
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1886
01:29:39.101 --> 01:29:40.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd,</v>

1887
01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:44.020
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to think that all the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we've talked about right now,</v>

1888
01:29:44.021 --> 01:29:44.854
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were,</v>

1889
01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:48.220
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't hear out of the mouths of </v>
<v Speaker 3>either hillary or</v>

1890
01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:49.620
<v Speaker 5>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe you would.</v>

1891
01:29:49.621 --> 01:29:51.720
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe you would even hear it </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the mouth of Obama.</v>

1892
01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:54.390
<v Speaker 5>I think everybody would be much more </v>
<v Speaker 5>measured.</v>

1893
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:57.420
<v Speaker 3>What I've said about Obama from the very</v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>

1894
01:29:57.421 --> 01:29:58.254
<v Speaker 3>and I'll still say it today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there anything that he says that you </v>

1895
01:30:00.631 --> 01:30:01.464
<v Speaker 3>can really disagree with?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always said that everything that </v>

1896
01:30:03.271 --> 01:30:07.410
<v Speaker 3>comes out of his mouth is like music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the reality hasn't matched up</v>

1897
01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.410
<v Speaker 5>with the words so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1898
01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:12.173
<v Speaker 5>the real problem is a lot of the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he said running versus what he's </v>

1899
01:30:15.511 --> 01:30:16.990
<v Speaker 5>done in office,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1900
01:30:17.010 --> 01:30:17.843
<v Speaker 5>The hope and change website that talks </v>
<v Speaker 5>about whistle blowers and then you look </v>

1901
01:30:20.671 --> 01:30:21.504
<v Speaker 5>at his actual actions towards whistle </v>
<v Speaker 5>blowers and actual actions towards the </v>

1902
01:30:24.571 --> 01:30:25.590
<v Speaker 5>press.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1903
01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:27.890
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty disturbing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1904
01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:31.680
<v Speaker 5>back to my open door after four or for </v>
<v Speaker 5>whistle blowers,</v>

1905
01:30:31.681 --> 01:30:32.850
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on in and talk to me.</v>

1906
01:30:32.851 --> 01:30:34.690
<v Speaker 5>Tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell me about what's going on.</v>

1907
01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.150
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was what I wanted to get to next.</v>

1908
01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:39.090
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I can jump into the middle of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I wanted to get to next.</v>

1909
01:30:39.150 --> 01:30:42.740
<v Speaker 5>So you're president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you handle Julian assange?</v>

1910
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:48.110
<v Speaker 5>How do you handle Edward Snowden?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you do about these two very high</v>

1911
01:30:48.661 --> 01:30:49.494
<v Speaker 5>profile situations where most people </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe that the information that they </v>

1912
01:30:52.710 --> 01:30:55.710
<v Speaker 5>released was very important to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>American public.</v>

1913
01:30:55.711 --> 01:30:59.340
<v Speaker 5>Very important to understanding what the</v>
<v Speaker 5>government is actually doing.</v>

1914
01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:00.730
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1915
01:31:00.731 --> 01:31:01.564
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1916
01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:04.750
<v Speaker 3>I believe in dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1917
01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:08.860
<v Speaker 3>Julian asage is not been charged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think by the US government.</v>

1918
01:31:09.170 --> 01:31:11.530
<v Speaker 3>We know what's really going on though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1919
01:31:11.531 --> 01:31:12.760
<v Speaker 3>we know what's really going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1920
01:31:12.761 --> 01:31:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Julia was on Snowden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1921
01:31:15.010 --> 01:31:16.090
<v Speaker 3>You Pardon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Snowden.</v>

1922
01:31:16.130 --> 01:31:16.963
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that he has brought to the </v>

1923
01:31:18.791 --> 01:31:21.450
<v Speaker 3>forefront this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1924
01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this mass surveillance,</v>

1925
01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:26.160
<v Speaker 3>but just but to play Sozo Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1926
01:31:26.530 --> 01:31:27.363
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>

1927
01:31:27.370 --> 01:31:32.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The entire NSA is an executive order 12,</v>

1928
01:31:33.191 --> 01:31:33.821
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

1929
01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:36.320
<v Speaker 3>three under truman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1930
01:31:36.430 --> 01:31:41.010
<v Speaker 3>you could repeal that executive order to</v>
<v Speaker 3>simply turn the satellites.</v>

1931
01:31:41.011 --> 01:31:46.011
<v Speaker 3>So wave from you and I this if they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do 10 million,</v>

1932
01:31:47.411 --> 01:31:51.090
<v Speaker 3>verizon uses this metadata collection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

1933
01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:53.620
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's my understanding that you,</v>

1934
01:31:53.621 --> 01:31:57.280
<v Speaker 3>by executive order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could actually turn the satellites,</v>

1935
01:31:57.310 --> 01:32:00.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the bad guys as to US citizens.</v>

1936
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.800
<v Speaker 5>But don't you think that if someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually did that,</v>

1937
01:32:02.801 --> 01:32:05.320
<v Speaker 5>they'd probably put you in a convertible</v>
<v Speaker 5>and roll you through Dallas.</v>

1938
01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:07.033
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's also a possibility to say you're </v>

1939
01:32:10.241 --> 01:32:15.160
<v Speaker 5>going to get rid of the NSA or diminish </v>
<v Speaker 5>the NSA or the CIA or the FBI.</v>

1940
01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:17.210
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would be in a bad place.</v>

1941
01:32:17.710 --> 01:32:19.880
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of work with them,</v>

1942
01:32:19.881 --> 01:32:21.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that the best way to handle it and</v>

1943
01:32:21.621 --> 01:32:23.030
<v Speaker 3>still keep your head?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or how bout,</v>

1944
01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:25.820
<v Speaker 3>how bout the notion of really just doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right thing?</v>

1945
01:32:25.821 --> 01:32:30.400
<v Speaker 3>And so the Edward Snowden situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you see the snowden movie that,</v>

1946
01:32:30.450 --> 01:32:31.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was it called,</v>

1947
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:37.190
<v Speaker 3>citizen for citizen for everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening got a c it,</v>

1948
01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:38.820
<v Speaker 3>Edward Snowden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1949
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:41.120
<v Speaker 3>he laid it all out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't about him,</v>

1950
01:32:41.121 --> 01:32:41.954
<v Speaker 3>it was about the information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gave all the information to media </v>

1951
01:32:46.370 --> 01:32:47.203
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do not in any way have the resources </v>

1952
01:32:49.911 --> 01:32:52.760
<v Speaker 3>to release this data because if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>release this data,</v>

1953
01:32:52.761 --> 01:32:55.520
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm going to put people in harm's </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1954
01:32:55.521 --> 01:32:58.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to put people's in people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in harm's way.</v>

1955
01:32:58.460 --> 01:32:59.293
<v Speaker 3>So I'm giving this up to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the institutions that </v>

1956
01:33:03.621 --> 01:33:05.200
<v Speaker 3>he gave it up too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he said,</v>

1957
01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:08.890
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they have the resources that,</v>

1958
01:33:08.891 --> 01:33:09.724
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will be able to disseminate this </v>

1959

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1963
01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:25.940
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

1964
01:33:25.970 --> 01:33:27.020
<v Speaker 5>which one was the drama?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't it?</v>

1965
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:28.880
<v Speaker 5>One wasn't there one that was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>dramatization.</v>

1966
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:30.520
<v Speaker 5>It coming out soon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a dramatization.</v>

1967
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:31.401
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1968
01:33:31.401 --> 01:33:33.830
<v Speaker 5>So citizen four was the actual </v>
<v Speaker 5>documentary.</v>

1969
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:35.950
<v Speaker 5>It was the actual documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where were,</v>

1970
01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:36.793
<v Speaker 5>when they showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was Edward Snowden and they showed </v>

1971
01:33:38.841 --> 01:33:40.850
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't know who Edward Snowden was.</v>

1972
01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:42.950
<v Speaker 5>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was amazing.</v>

1973
01:33:42.951 --> 01:33:44.170
<v Speaker 5>You've got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to see it.</v>

1974
01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:45.900
<v Speaker 5>You've got to see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll definitely say it.</v>

1975
01:33:45.901 --> 01:33:46.734
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1976
01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:50.690
<v Speaker 5>to play devil's advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you do pardon Snowden,</v>

1977
01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:54.140
<v Speaker 5>that means that if there was a crime </v>
<v Speaker 5>being committed at all,</v>

1978
01:33:54.141 --> 01:33:56.300
<v Speaker 5>that crime is being committed by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>NSA.</v>

1979
01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:58.610
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you demonize snowden,</v>

1980
01:33:58.670 --> 01:33:59.503
<v Speaker 5>as soon as they arrest Doden or they try</v>
<v Speaker 5>to rest snowden and they say the </v>

1981
01:34:01.941 --> 01:34:04.010
<v Speaker 5>snowdens a bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what he's done is terrible.</v>

1982
01:34:04.011 --> 01:34:06.170
<v Speaker 5>If it comes the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're absolutely going to arrest him.</v>

1983
01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:08.910
<v Speaker 5>What you're saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're putting the,</v>

1984
01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:11.870
<v Speaker 5>the focus on him as a potential </v>
<v Speaker 5>criminal.</v>

1985
01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:12.800
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

1986
01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:15.900
<v Speaker 5>if somehow or another he is exonerated </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's really,</v>

1987
01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:17.150
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what happened then?</v>

1988
01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.260
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there a crime?</v>

1989
01:34:18.261 --> 01:34:19.220
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if he's exonerated,</v>

1990
01:34:19.221 --> 01:34:20.054
<v Speaker 5>if he's done something that violates the</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever agreement that he had to sign </v>

1991
01:34:24.501 --> 01:34:25.334
<v Speaker 5>in order to work for the NSA,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that means that the crime that he </v>

1992
01:34:29.061 --> 01:34:29.894
<v Speaker 5>exposed was so significant that it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>valid for him to violate whatever </v>

1993
01:34:35.451 --> 01:34:37.520
<v Speaker 5>agreement he signed with the federal </v>
<v Speaker 5>government.</v>

1994
01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:38.533
<v Speaker 5>That right now they're pursuing him as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>criminal for which means someone needs </v>

1995
01:34:41.691 --> 01:34:44.960
<v Speaker 5>to go to jail for the crime if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they're not going to put him in jail</v>

1996
01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:48.770
<v Speaker 3>and prosecute him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting way of looking at it.</v>

1997
01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:53.390
<v Speaker 3>I look at it from the standpoint of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a mistake that we've made.</v>

1998
01:34:53.391 --> 01:34:55.560
<v Speaker 3>Let's acknowledge the mistake and let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1999
01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 3>let's move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's correct as so I'm</v>

2000
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.410
<v Speaker 1>not knocking that simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2001
01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:00.500
<v Speaker 1>We had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may not be,</v>

2002
01:35:00.501 --> 01:35:01.334
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2003
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:03.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not looking at this from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2004
01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:08.570
<v Speaker 1>from the standpoint of prosecuting </v>
<v Speaker 1>people as much as we've made a mistake.</v>

2005
01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's correct it is this is what this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country is really about.</v>

2006
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:17.590
<v Speaker 1>They're still moving forward with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>data collection thing in Utah unabated.</v>

2007
01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:20.390
<v Speaker 1>And when you have testimony before </v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress,</v>

2008
01:35:20.391 --> 01:35:22.730
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you spying on the American people?</v>

2009
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:24.890
<v Speaker 1>And the response is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2010
01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:26.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

2011
01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:28.073
<v Speaker 1>Are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is their mass surveillance of the </v>

2012
01:35:29.811 --> 01:35:31.850
<v Speaker 1>American public going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they said,</v>

2013
01:35:31.851 --> 01:35:32.684
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question should have been total </v>

2014
01:35:36.111 --> 01:35:38.450
<v Speaker 1>surveillance as mass surveillance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

2015
01:35:38.451 --> 01:35:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2016
01:35:39.921 --> 01:35:41.390
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a hundred.</v>

2017
01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:45.530
<v Speaker 1>So he says no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer being hundreds of millions of</v>

2018
01:35:45.531 --> 01:35:49.280
<v Speaker 1>total surveillance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>master males surveillance as far as mass</v>

2019
01:35:49.281 --> 01:35:51.200
<v Speaker 1>surveillance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's correct.</v>

2020
01:35:51.230 --> 01:35:53.980
<v Speaker 1>It's actually honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they know we're,</v>

2021
01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:56.300
<v Speaker 1>we're pursing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're parsing things here,</v>

2022
01:35:56.301 --> 01:35:57.110
<v Speaker 1>but come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2023
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:58.250
<v Speaker 1>we've been misled.</v>

2024
01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:01.320
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not the country that uh,</v>

2025
01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:02.233
<v Speaker 1>we fought wars to preserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does this go back to what we're talking </v>

2026
01:36:04.401 --> 01:36:05.234
<v Speaker 1>about before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were businesses tend to lean towards </v>

2027
01:36:07.821 --> 01:36:08.654
<v Speaker 1>growth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the NSA is involved in growth and </v>

2028
01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:14.330
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to stop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

2029
01:36:14.331 --> 01:36:16.090
<v Speaker 1>It's the Peter Principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2030
01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:16.993
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to justify my life and button to </v>

2031
01:36:19.461 --> 01:36:20.630
<v Speaker 1>justify my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these are,</v>

2032
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about bureaucrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nows justify my life.</v>

2033
01:36:23.631 --> 01:36:24.464
<v Speaker 1>I need to grow what it is I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to prove that what I'm doing so </v>

2034
01:36:26.871 --> 01:36:29.660
<v Speaker 1>important that I need people working for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2035
01:36:29.690 --> 01:36:32.420
<v Speaker 1>I need to expand what I'm doing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so important.</v>

2036
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:36.260
<v Speaker 1>So what would you be able to do if </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

2037
01:36:36.261 --> 01:36:39.700
<v Speaker 1>as a president?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get into office and with Ensa.</v>

2038
01:36:39.730 --> 01:36:40.563
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2039
01:36:41.230 --> 01:36:42.063
<v Speaker 1>it just came to my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just came to my attention like 10 </v>

2040
01:36:44.751 --> 01:36:48.640
<v Speaker 1>days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the NSA is an executive order under</v>

2041
01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:49.483
<v Speaker 1>truman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the president of the United States </v>

2042
01:36:51.141 --> 01:36:52.880
<v Speaker 1>could repeal immediately.</v>

2043
01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:54.650
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be ugly.</v>

2044
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't let you do that?</v>

2045
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2046
01:37:00.050 --> 01:37:02.000
<v Speaker 1>nothing is simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is simple.</v>

2047
01:37:02.001 --> 01:37:02.834
<v Speaker 1>I do not want to downplay on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the complexity of what this might </v>

2048
01:37:06.801 --> 01:37:08.600
<v Speaker 1>entail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>

2049
01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:09.853
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it possible to turn the satellites </v>

2050
01:37:11.631 --> 01:37:13.280
<v Speaker 1>away from you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I will.</v>

2051
01:37:13.281 --> 01:37:16.850
<v Speaker 1>That would be the thing be that we would</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to get rid of the NSA.</v>

2052
01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:19.790
<v Speaker 1>What would it want to be as maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>redirect their efforts?</v>

2053
01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2054
01:37:20.841 --> 01:37:23.880
<v Speaker 1>as in protecting us again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having an indigo,</v>

2055
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:25.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a,</v>

2056
01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:27.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2057
01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:32.360
<v Speaker 1>an impenetrable national defense is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>impenetrable national defense.</v>

2058
01:37:34.701 --> 01:37:35.361
<v Speaker 1>Does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2059
01:37:35.361 --> 01:37:36.450
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or William,</v>

2060
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:37.663
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is 1984 they've got the satellites </v>

2061
01:37:39.861 --> 01:37:41.420
<v Speaker 1>on to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2062
01:37:41.421 --> 01:37:42.254
<v Speaker 1>It is bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre that they've just randomly </v>

2063
01:37:43.911 --> 01:37:48.650
<v Speaker 1>decided to get the entire country under </v>
<v Speaker 1>surveillance when there's no evidence to</v>

2064
01:37:48.651 --> 01:37:49.930
<v Speaker 1>point that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2065
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:52.580
<v Speaker 1>you're stopping anything or eliminating </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

2066
01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 1>but you are putting people in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>compromised because</v>

2067
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.903
<v Speaker 4>if people know that the government has </v>
<v Speaker 4>been paying attention to all of their </v>

2068
01:37:58.921 --> 01:38:03.921
<v Speaker 4>emails and voicemails and all that jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then people will adjust their behavior.</v>

2069
01:38:04.410 --> 01:38:05.243
<v Speaker 4>They'll be a little bit more cautious </v>
<v Speaker 4>that a little bit more cautious with </v>

2070
01:38:07.351 --> 01:38:10.980
<v Speaker 4>their criticism and if you are ever in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>situation,</v>

2071
01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:12.120
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2072
01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.393
<v Speaker 4>And if you're ever in a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you are against the government in any </v>

2073
01:38:15.991 --> 01:38:18.690
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will have so much data on you.</v>

2074
01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:20.393
<v Speaker 4>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're one of those people that </v>

2075
01:38:21.511 --> 01:38:23.730
<v Speaker 4>decides to Edward Snowden it from here </v>
<v Speaker 4>on out,</v>

2076
01:38:24.090 --> 01:38:25.530
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good luck with that.</v>

2077
01:38:25.531 --> 01:38:30.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean they will instantly be pulling up</v>
<v Speaker 4>emails and voicemails and,</v>

2078
01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:34.080
<v Speaker 4>and you've got a real problem on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>hands because it's not just met a data,</v>

2079
01:38:34.110 --> 01:38:35.660
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's also been proven.</v>

2080
01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:38.400
<v Speaker 4>We don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>

2081
01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:39.653
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You remember the guy who initially was </v>

2082
01:38:42.361 --> 01:38:43.480
<v Speaker 4>the whistle blower?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Many,</v>

2083
01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.070
<v Speaker 3>many areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are many of them.</v>

2084
01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:48.130
<v Speaker 3>There are many of them that are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>prison for</v>

2085
01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:49.500
<v Speaker 4>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2086
01:38:49.501 --> 01:38:50.334
<v Speaker 4>well there's a gentleman that was one of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the original whistle blowers who was </v>

2087
01:38:52.771 --> 01:38:53.604
<v Speaker 4>actually one of the coders who was </v>
<v Speaker 4>working with the NSA when they first </v>

2088
01:38:57.451 --> 01:39:02.451
<v Speaker 4>started designing this sort of program </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he resigned and went public with all</v>

2089
01:39:02.531 --> 01:39:05.030
<v Speaker 4>of this and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2090
01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:06.293
<v Speaker 4>when he was vilified and when Edward </v>
<v Speaker 4>Snowden came out with all of this </v>

2091
01:39:11.161 --> 01:39:11.994
<v Speaker 4>information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy started doing interviews again </v>

2092
01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:15.270
<v Speaker 4>and he started saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

2093
01:39:15.271 --> 01:39:16.104
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was talking about this in the early </v>

2094
01:39:17.371 --> 01:39:18.204
<v Speaker 4>two thousands I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is something they'd been putting </v>

2095
01:39:19.741 --> 01:39:22.620
<v Speaker 4>into play for a long time during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bush administration.</v>

2096
01:39:22.621 --> 01:39:23.880
<v Speaker 4>They started us all off</v>

2097
01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.110
<v Speaker 3>the NSA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2098
01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:28.411
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2099
01:39:28.411 --> 01:39:30.030
<v Speaker 3>I think it goes back further than that.</v>

2100
01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:30.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it does too.</v>

2101
01:39:31.250 --> 01:39:32.730
<v Speaker 4>It's a true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the guy,</v>

2102
01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:33.930
<v Speaker 4>Bill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Binney,</v>

2103
01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:37.830
<v Speaker 4>the original NSA whistleblower unstowed </v>
<v Speaker 4>in nine 11 and illegal surveillance.</v>

2104
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:40.190
<v Speaker 4>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very interesting story.</v>

2105
01:39:40.191 --> 01:39:41.024
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's several interviews with this </v>

2106
01:39:41.971 --> 01:39:43.890
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one is from computer weekly,</v>

2107
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:47.130
<v Speaker 4>but there's several interviews with is </v>
<v Speaker 4>this gentleman,</v>

2108
01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:50.010
<v Speaker 4>he was the original blowing what was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>year of this Jamie?</v>

2109
01:39:50.011 --> 01:39:53.190
<v Speaker 4>Cause I want to say 2007 but I might be </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>

2110
01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.780
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2111
01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:00.090
<v Speaker 4>what does it matter?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Binney is the guy and I've seen him</v>

2112
01:40:00.091 --> 01:40:04.620
<v Speaker 4>interviewed several times and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>realized while this was all going on,</v>

2113
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:07.500
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not looking for criminals.</v>

2114
01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:10.110
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to spy on everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't do this.</v>

2115
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:13.440
<v Speaker 4>And I think we all agree that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't be able to do that.</v>

2116
01:40:13.441 --> 01:40:15.060
<v Speaker 4>But right now that's happening.</v>

2117
01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:17.370
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and very simply,</v>

2118
01:40:17.371 --> 01:40:18.204
<v Speaker 3>there is a process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fourth amendment there is due </v>

2119
01:40:20.011 --> 01:40:20.844
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if there's a bad guy out there that </v>

2120
01:40:22.681 --> 01:40:23.550
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2121
01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:25.830
<v Speaker 3>the federal government wants to spy on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a warrant,</v>

2122
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:27.510
<v Speaker 3>got to get a warrant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's how it should be.</v>

2123
01:40:27.570 --> 01:40:28.570
<v Speaker 3>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2124
01:40:28.650 --> 01:40:32.490
<v Speaker 3>Pfizer court where the government goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>before the Pfizer court and says,</v>

2125
01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:34.600
<v Speaker 3>we want authority to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2126
01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:39.210
<v Speaker 3>to collect metadata on 110 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>verizon users.</v>

2127
01:40:39.211 --> 01:40:42.520
<v Speaker 3>I fail to see where that's due process </v>
<v Speaker 3>in any way shape</v>

2128
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:45.340
<v Speaker 4>I have no one has made an argument </v>
<v Speaker 4>against that.</v>

2129
01:40:45.370 --> 01:40:46.203
<v Speaker 4>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one has made an argument that makes </v>

2130
01:40:46.781 --> 01:40:50.080
<v Speaker 4>any sense whatsoever supporting that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if that's the case,</v>

2131
01:40:50.081 --> 01:40:53.080
<v Speaker 4>why is it president allow it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good question.</v>

2132
01:40:53.530 --> 01:40:54.363
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he's the guy that has all this music </v>

2133
01:40:55.661 --> 01:40:58.480
<v Speaker 4>coming out of his mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are his words that are so beautiful</v>

2134
01:40:58.481 --> 01:41:00.940
<v Speaker 4>and melodic about this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of water.</v>

2135
01:41:01.330 --> 01:41:02.530
<v Speaker 4>What's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

2136
01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:04.150
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the big go.</v>

2137
01:41:04.151 --> 01:41:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Obama disappointment is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2138
01:41:06.630 --> 01:41:10.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure if we went into the archives he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have been addressed.</v>

2139
01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:11.093
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe he wouldn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he wouldn't have even known about </v>

2140
01:41:12.601 --> 01:41:14.320
<v Speaker 2>this metadata collection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

2141
01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:15.370
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2142
01:41:15.371 --> 01:41:16.204
<v Speaker 4>he was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the hope and change website when he </v>

2143
01:41:17.891 --> 01:41:18.724
<v Speaker 4>was running for president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things he was talking about </v>

2144
01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:24.730
<v Speaker 4>was supporting whistleblowers that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>revealing criminal activity.</v>

2145
01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:27.610
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's directly contradicted that.</v>

2146
01:41:27.611 --> 01:41:28.444
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's everything he's done in regards to </v>

2147
01:41:30.281 --> 01:41:33.460
<v Speaker 4>people blowing whistles and revealing </v>
<v Speaker 4>government problems.</v>

2148
01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:35.140
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's prosecuted them.</v>

2149
01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:38.170
<v Speaker 4>They'd been worse on freedom of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>press than any other president.</v>

2150
01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:43.320
<v Speaker 4>We will look at Bush as being like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>really terrible like a draconian guy,</v>

2151
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:44.583
<v Speaker 4>but the Bush administration was easier </v>
<v Speaker 4>on whistle blowers and easier on press </v>

2152
01:41:48.251 --> 01:41:50.170
<v Speaker 4>and trying to get pressed to reveal </v>
<v Speaker 4>their sources.</v>

2153
01:41:50.171 --> 01:41:55.171
<v Speaker 4>Then the Obama administration back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>back to the reality.</v>

2154
01:41:55.241 --> 01:41:57.070
<v Speaker 4>Not matching up at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2155
01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:58.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reality,</v>

2156
01:41:58.121 --> 01:42:02.110
<v Speaker 4>not matching up at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just with the words but with the,</v>

2157
01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:05.020
<v Speaker 4>the appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's the appearance of this,</v>

2158
01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:10.410
<v Speaker 4>this really educated like socially aware</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy who gets into play black.</v>

2159
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:14.950
<v Speaker 4>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got this articulate,</v>

2160
01:42:14.951 --> 01:42:16.930
<v Speaker 4>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well read president.</v>

2161
01:42:17.110 --> 01:42:19.770
<v Speaker 4>This is a relief from the guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2162
01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:22.540
<v Speaker 4>stumbles through words and says a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 4>of stupid shit.</v>

2163
01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:24.850
<v Speaker 4>Like this is our guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is our guy.</v>

2164
01:42:24.851 --> 01:42:27.640
<v Speaker 4>Finally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then same practices,</v>

2165
01:42:27.670 --> 01:42:28.630
<v Speaker 4>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>worse,</v>

2166
01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:30.220
<v Speaker 4>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more drone attacks,</v>

2167
01:42:30.221 --> 01:42:31.060
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2168
01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:32.253
<v Speaker 4>what do you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you do about a program that the </v>

2169
01:42:34.301 --> 01:42:37.830
<v Speaker 4>drone attacks have resulted in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe the numbers,</v>

2170
01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:38.673
<v Speaker 4>like more than 80% accidental death or </v>
<v Speaker 4>more than 80% civilians being killed </v>

2171
01:42:45.731 --> 01:42:47.620
<v Speaker 4>versus the intended target.</v>

2172
01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:48.733
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the unintended consequence of </v>

2173
01:42:50.841 --> 01:42:53.930
<v Speaker 2>our military interventions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're making things worse,</v>

2174
01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:54.793
<v Speaker 2>not better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I am talking about boots on the </v>

2175
01:42:56.871 --> 01:42:59.270
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about dropping bombs and the</v>

2176
01:42:59.271 --> 01:43:03.110
<v Speaker 2>fact that drones do fly and kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of innocent people.</v>

2177
01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:07.350
<v Speaker 4>And when I had Mike Baker on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was a former CIA operative,</v>

2178
01:43:07.351 --> 01:43:09.090
<v Speaker 4>when he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he and I were discussing this,</v>

2179
01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:10.290
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was saying that,</v>

2180
01:43:10.291 --> 01:43:12.690
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're seeing is lawyers make those</v>

2181
01:43:12.691 --> 01:43:13.524
<v Speaker 4>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these decisions of whether to bomb or </v>

2182
01:43:15.481 --> 01:43:17.430
<v Speaker 4>not to bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're being done by lawyers.</v>

2183
01:43:17.610 --> 01:43:20.370
<v Speaker 4>They sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they let go over the possibilities,</v>

2184
01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:24.420
<v Speaker 4>they go over the risks versus reward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they make the call.</v>

2185
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:30.400
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck kind of world is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the world that I'm with.</v>

2186
01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:33.060
<v Speaker 4>That's the world that can be changed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

2187
01:43:33.061 --> 01:43:34.950
<v Speaker 4>So here's the big battle ship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the United States.</v>

2188
01:43:35.010 --> 01:43:38.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2189
01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:39.450
<v Speaker 4>super tank or whatever you would call </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2190
01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Well first you got your cruiser first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2191
01:43:42.610 --> 01:43:43.443
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

2192
01:43:43.890 --> 01:43:44.723
<v Speaker 2>What is it at six months it takes six </v>
<v Speaker 2>miles to turn the six super tanker </v>

2193
01:43:47.431 --> 01:43:49.320
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turn it around 180 degrees.</v>

2194
01:43:49.321 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Well first you got to stop the engines </v>
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

2195
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.200
<v Speaker 2>First you got to actually start the </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

2196
01:43:54.230 --> 01:43:54.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2197
01:43:54.561 --> 01:43:55.394
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's six miles before you can </v>

2198
01:43:56.331 --> 01:43:58.100
<v Speaker 2>actually pull the uturn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2199
01:43:58.190 --> 01:44:00.080
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're full steam ahead.</v>

2200
01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:01.310
<v Speaker 2>We're still full steam ahead.</v>

2201
01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:02.750
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's talk military.</v>

2202
01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:04.250
<v Speaker 5>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in office,</v>

2203
01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 5>obviously you need to protect people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously there's threats out there,</v>

2204
01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:09.133
<v Speaker 5>both a broad and locally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you do in terms of minimizing </v>

2205
01:44:14.811 --> 01:44:16.520
<v Speaker 5>the amount of money that we spend on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>military?</v>

2206
01:44:16.730 --> 01:44:17.563
<v Speaker 5>Minimizing the amount of invasion of </v>
<v Speaker 5>privacy that the branches of the </v>

2207
01:44:21.201 --> 01:44:22.850
<v Speaker 5>military,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like things like the NSA,</v>

2208
01:44:22.851 --> 01:44:26.510
<v Speaker 5>which I guess you consider the military,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of security apparatus for us.</v>

2209
01:44:26.730 --> 01:44:28.450
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would you consider the NSA?</v>

2210
01:44:28.451 --> 01:44:31.220
<v Speaker 5>Is that military?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would you consider it?</v>

2211
01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:33.270
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>National Security Administration,</v>

2212
01:44:33.290 --> 01:44:35.300
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously it's,</v>

2213
01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.910
<v Speaker 5>some has to do with the military,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2214
01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:41.810
<v Speaker 5>Has To be oversight or has to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has to be,</v>

2215
01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:43.123
<v Speaker 5>has to be some transparency.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when you're talking about the </v>

2216
01:44:45.411 --> 01:44:46.244
<v Speaker 5>military,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you go about minimizing the </v>

2217
01:44:48.411 --> 01:44:51.890
<v Speaker 5>impact or minimizing the negative </v>
<v Speaker 5>aspects of it?</v>

2218
01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:53.300
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2219
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:55.700
<v Speaker 5>make no bones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we're attacked,</v>

2220
01:44:55.730 --> 01:44:56.563
<v Speaker 5>we're going to attack back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we should have an impenetrable </v>

2221
01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:00.950
<v Speaker 5>national defense,</v>

2222
01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:05.480
<v Speaker 2>but we're anything but defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Congress in all of this,</v>

2223
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:06.343
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've abdicated their responsibility </v>

2224
01:45:08.571 --> 01:45:13.571
<v Speaker 2>to declare war for the American people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a discussion and debate over how</v>

2225
01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:19.790
<v Speaker 2>the military should proceed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've abdicated that responsibility to</v>

2226
01:45:19.791 --> 01:45:21.980
<v Speaker 2>the president of the United States who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this,</v>

2227
01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:23.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on executive.</v>

2228
01:45:23.031 --> 01:45:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2229
01:45:23.110 --> 01:45:27.180
<v Speaker 5>Border along with the military.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where I rack got really weird,</v>

2230
01:45:27.181 --> 01:45:29.970
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where it wasn't an actual act of war.</v>

2231
01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:30.790
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't that right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That</v>

2232
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:32.550
<v Speaker 2>congress had allowed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

2233
01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:33.633
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Congress has allowed the president </v>

2234
01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:37.290
<v Speaker 2>to carry on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2235
01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:41.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do what the president sees fit.</v>

2236
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2237
01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:44.080
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my opinion.</v>

2238
01:45:44.081 --> 01:45:44.914
<v Speaker 2>That's an abdication of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of constitutional responsibility by </v>

2239
01:45:48.221 --> 01:45:50.500
<v Speaker 2>Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's reestablish that.</v>

2240
01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:53.860
<v Speaker 2>I think the biggest threat in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now is,</v>

2241
01:45:53.861 --> 01:45:57.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is North Korea and the fact that at some</v>

2242
01:45:57.161 --> 01:45:58.210
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2243
01:45:58.240 --> 01:45:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2244
01:45:59.290 --> 01:46:04.290
<v Speaker 2>is at some point these intercontinental </v>
<v Speaker 2>ballistic missiles are going to work.</v>

2245
01:46:05.410 --> 01:46:09.220
<v Speaker 2>And this guy isn't not so hot about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>notion of,</v>

2246
01:46:09.221 --> 01:46:10.054
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really getting together with China </v>

2247
01:46:11.711 --> 01:46:14.410
<v Speaker 2>because this is in China's best interest</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2248
01:46:14.411 --> 01:46:17.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get rid of Kim unify the Koreas,</v>

2249
01:46:17.710 --> 01:46:21.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get American troops out of South Korea.</v>

2250
01:46:21.550 --> 01:46:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Cuba,</v>

2251
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:26.260
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't,</v>

2252
01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:28.540
<v Speaker 2>we didn't put up for a second that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2253
01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:32.560
<v Speaker 2>that Russia was going to occupy or have </v>
<v Speaker 2>missiles in,</v>

2254
01:46:32.561 --> 01:46:33.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2255
01:46:33.791 --> 01:46:34.720
<v Speaker 2>in Cuba.</v>

2256
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Do you think China likes the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we got 40,000 troops in Korea?</v>

2257
01:46:39.810 --> 01:46:40.361
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2258
01:46:40.361 --> 01:46:41.920
<v Speaker 2>They don't like it a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2259
01:46:42.190 --> 01:46:46.420
<v Speaker 2>do we not make the world a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>secure if we can't come to terms with,</v>

2260
01:46:46.450 --> 01:46:49.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with China on how we can,</v>

2261
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:50.183
<v Speaker 2>with what I will argue the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>threat in the world right now in China </v>

2262
01:46:53.011 --> 01:46:54.870
<v Speaker 2>is an ally of North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>

2263
01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:59.010
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're an embarrassment to from all</v>

2264
01:46:59.011 --> 01:47:00.950
<v Speaker 2>that I can glean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're an embarrassment.</v>

2265
01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:05.960
<v Speaker 2>A 70% of South Korea's trade export goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to China.</v>

2266
01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:08.093
<v Speaker 2>None of North Korea's export goes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>China because there is no product to </v>

2267
01:47:12.931 --> 01:47:14.200
<v Speaker 2>export.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2268
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:15.660
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2269
01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:19.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's turned that ship around.</v>

2270
01:47:19.231 --> 01:47:20.064
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to talk about turning a tough </v>

2271
01:47:21.121 --> 01:47:24.280
<v Speaker 2>ship around the North Korea ship when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about an entire brainwash</v>

2272
01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:26.400
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very sad,</v>

2273
01:47:26.401 --> 01:47:29.340
<v Speaker 2>sad state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>China is not blind to that.</v>

2274
01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Let's take advantage of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2275
01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:33.300
<v Speaker 2>let's take advantage of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2276
01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:38.420
<v Speaker 2>of establishing a partnership and </v>
<v Speaker 2>alliance with China to deal with that,</v>

2277
01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:41.370
<v Speaker 2>but there are already so poor and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>screwed over.</v>

2278
01:47:41.371 --> 01:47:46.371
<v Speaker 2>What do you do as opposed metairie </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention as opposed to us as opposed</v>

2279
01:47:47.341 --> 01:47:48.174
<v Speaker 2>to us dealing with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in China's best interest to deal </v>

2280
01:47:51.481 --> 01:47:54.660
<v Speaker 2>with this and so that China has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are,</v>

2281
01:47:54.661 --> 01:47:58.770

<v Speaker 2>miles off their coast or whatever it is.</v>

2282
01:47:58.771 --> 01:48:00.180
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the big deal?</v>

2283
01:48:00.210 --> 01:48:02.990
<v Speaker 2>The United States does this all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like what do you say?</v>

2286
01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:06.673
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is somehow a threat to US security </v>

2287
01:48:08.701 --> 01:48:09.630
<v Speaker 2>that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2288
01:48:09.631 --> 01:48:13.260

<v Speaker 2>off of their mainland.</v>

2289
01:48:13.370 --> 01:48:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>

2290
01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:16.553
<v Speaker 2>We're spending more on out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're spending as much money on our </v>

2291
01:48:19.111 --> 01:48:23.430
<v Speaker 2>military as the all the other nations in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world combined.</v>

2292
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:24.383
<v Speaker 2>What does that say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that say maybe we're spending more </v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't want to put troops in harm's </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2303
01:48:53.461 --> 01:48:54.294
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want,</v>

2304
01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:55.493
<v Speaker 2>I don't want men and women dying in </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations where that does not have to </v>

2305
01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:01.020
<v Speaker 2>take place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2306
01:49:01.050 --> 01:49:03.430
<v Speaker 2>that fact they get injured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come back here,</v>

2307
01:49:03.431 --> 01:49:06.420
<v Speaker 2>the rest of their lives there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're affected by</v>

2308
01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:11.060
<v Speaker 5>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you.</v>

2309
01:49:11.061 --> 01:49:13.400
<v Speaker 5>But to play devil's advocate and take </v>
<v Speaker 5>their point of view,</v>

2310
01:49:13.401 --> 01:49:18.260
<v Speaker 5>they would say that what they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>overseas is saving things from happening</v>

2311
01:49:18.261 --> 01:49:23.240
<v Speaker 5>here and keeping people safe by </v>
<v Speaker 5>intervening in other countries,</v>

2312
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:26.240
<v Speaker 5>by blocking things from taking place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2313
01:49:26.241 --> 01:49:27.074
<v Speaker 5>this would be the argument for a large </v>
<v Speaker 5>prevalent military that is this all </v>

2314
01:49:30.981 --> 01:49:31.070
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2315
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:33.350
<v Speaker 2>The world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is always the argument.</v>

2316
01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:37.850
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that these interventions at best make</v>

2317
01:49:37.851 --> 01:49:42.350
<v Speaker 2>things the same or leave things the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>but versus get worse.</v>

2318
01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:45.480
<v Speaker 5>That's what their argument would be like</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they weren't doing this,</v>

2319
01:49:45.481 --> 01:49:46.314
<v Speaker 5>that you would have the superpowers </v>
<v Speaker 5>developed in these other countries and </v>

2320
01:49:49.031 --> 01:49:51.190
<v Speaker 5>it would become a gigantic issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's Iran,</v>

2321
01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:53.500
<v Speaker 5>whether it's Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's whatever it is,</v>

2322
01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:55.210
<v Speaker 5>take it rock for an example,</v>

2323
01:49:55.580 --> 01:49:58.500
<v Speaker 3>we intervene in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2324
01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:02.640
<v Speaker 3>the biggest threat to Iran was Iraq with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saddam Hussein.</v>

2325
01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:06.040
<v Speaker 3>That that's all their concern was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was how,</v>

2326
01:50:06.041 --> 01:50:08.490
<v Speaker 3>how did they deal with Saddam Hussein in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iraq?</v>

2327
01:50:08.491 --> 01:50:10.680
<v Speaker 3>We go in and we'd take out Saddam </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hussein.</v>

2328
01:50:10.710 --> 01:50:11.543
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now all of a sudden we cut the head of </v>

2329
01:50:12.661 --> 01:50:15.060
<v Speaker 3>that hydro off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now all of a sudden we have to deal with</v>

2330
01:50:15.061 --> 01:50:17.130
<v Speaker 3>Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something that we weren't having to deal</v>

2331
01:50:17.131 --> 01:50:20.490
<v Speaker 3>with before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an unintended consequence.</v>

2332
01:50:20.790 --> 01:50:22.680
<v Speaker 5>Do we need to deal with Iran?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2333
01:50:22.681 --> 01:50:25.350
<v Speaker 5>what is the reason why we have to deal </v>
<v Speaker 5>with Iran?</v>

2334
01:50:25.690 --> 01:50:28.200
<v Speaker 3>They're the biggest funder of terrorism </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>

2335
01:50:28.230 --> 01:50:29.960
<v Speaker 3>They fund terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2336
01:50:30.230 --> 01:50:31.830
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's undeniable.</v>

2337
01:50:32.130 --> 01:50:36.180
<v Speaker 3>So at first I was in support of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>treaty and naively,</v>

2338
01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:38.580
<v Speaker 3>meaning the treaty that we signed with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iran that,</v>

2339
01:50:38.581 --> 01:50:41.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ended up releasing however much money it</v>

2340
01:50:41.191 --> 01:50:45.600
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$160 billion in by secretary Kerry's own</v>

2341
01:50:45.601 --> 01:50:47.420
<v Speaker 3>image admission,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2342
01:50:47.850 --> 01:50:48.900
<v Speaker 3>question was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>

2343
01:50:48.901 --> 01:50:52.410
<v Speaker 3>will there not be funds that will get </v>
<v Speaker 3>directed at terrorism?</v>

2344
01:50:52.411 --> 01:50:53.880
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2345
01:50:53.881 --> 01:50:56.550
<v Speaker 3>there will be funds that will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>directed at terrorism.</v>

2346
01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:57.953
<v Speaker 3>So how on earth could we have signed </v>
<v Speaker 3>that agreement with Iran given the fact </v>

2347
01:51:03.661 --> 01:51:06.510
<v Speaker 3>that they are the biggest funder of </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorism</v>

2348
01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:07.533
<v Speaker 5>world?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is their motivation of fund </v>

2349
01:51:08.681 --> 01:51:09.514
<v Speaker 5>terrorism?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is their motivation to fund terrorism </v>

2350
01:51:10.961 --> 01:51:11.794
<v Speaker 5>because they're concerned with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>United States continuing to develop </v>

2351
01:51:14.201 --> 01:51:16.090
<v Speaker 5>power in the Middle East?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what is there?</v>

2352
01:51:16.110 --> 01:51:19.000
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could be a common devil's advocate.</v>

2353
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:19.471
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2354
01:51:19.471 --> 01:51:19.790
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2355
01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:21.520
<v Speaker 5>It could be a con.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to</v>

2356
01:51:21.540 --> 01:51:25.230
<v Speaker 3>discount anything that's being said by </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone,</v>

2357
01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:28.620
<v Speaker 3>but from our standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2358
01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:33.800
<v Speaker 3>this is w we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're contributing to what will be,</v>

2359
01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:35.033
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more terrorism because terrorism will </v>

2360
01:51:36.841 --> 01:51:39.660
<v Speaker 3>get funded from some of this money that </v>
<v Speaker 3>got freed up.</v>

2361
01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:40.903
<v Speaker 5>Now when you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you say funding terrorism </v>

2362
01:51:42.591 --> 01:51:44.120
<v Speaker 5>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you mean?</v>

2363
01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:45.673
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where were we at some point the these </v>

2364
01:51:49.611 --> 01:51:53.210
<v Speaker 3>terrorist groups and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and who's to say,</v>

2365
01:51:53.211 --> 01:51:56.510
<v Speaker 3>where are the connection using Brussels </v>
<v Speaker 3>as an example?</v>

2366
01:51:56.540 --> 01:51:57.373
<v Speaker 3>Who's to say where those guys were </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting their funds from their support </v>

2367
01:52:01.671 --> 01:52:02.504
<v Speaker 3>from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2368
01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:03.693
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a stretch to say that it may </v>

2369
01:52:06.981 --> 01:52:08.600
<v Speaker 3>have come from Iran,</v>

2370
01:52:08.810 --> 01:52:12.050
<v Speaker 5>but isn't that a big statement that </v>
<v Speaker 5>should be qualified?</v>

2371
01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:15.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless of whether it's Brussels or,</v>

2372
01:52:15.621 --> 01:52:16.454
<v Speaker 3>or wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at some point the funding for terrorism </v>

2373
01:52:20.511 --> 01:52:23.630
<v Speaker 3>has results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in this case,</v>

2374
01:52:23.631 --> 01:52:28.631
<v Speaker 3>if you are allowing a contributor to </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorism to have funds to contribute as</v>

2375
01:52:30.351 --> 01:52:32.750
<v Speaker 3>the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2376
01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:33.713
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we not making the situation worse </v>

2377
01:52:35.301 --> 01:52:39.440
<v Speaker 3>when we go in and militarily intervene </v>
<v Speaker 3>and leave equipment,</v>

2378
01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:40.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan,</v>

2379
01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:45.880
<v Speaker 3>we leave equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we ended up arming the Taliban when the,</v>

2380
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.220
<v Speaker 2>when the Russians leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Taliban is equipped to,</v>

2381
01:52:49.221 --> 01:52:54.221
<v Speaker 2>they're equipped with a US arms because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we use the Taliban to fight,</v>

2382
01:52:54.490 --> 01:52:56.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Russians.</v>

2383
01:52:56.230 --> 01:52:57.580
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But to bring them back to Iran.</v>

2384
01:52:57.581 --> 01:53:01.920
<v Speaker 5>What if any evidence is available that </v>
<v Speaker 5>shows that I ran funded terrorism,</v>

2385
01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:03.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unequivocal.</v>

2386
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2387
01:53:05.070 --> 01:53:07.900
<v Speaker 2>I can't state for you the ABC's of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2388
01:53:07.901 --> 01:53:10.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unequivocal sec,</v>

<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2392
01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:16.533
<v Speaker 2>isn't some of this money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it going to get directed at </v>

2393
01:53:20.621 --> 01:53:22.960
<v Speaker 2>funding terrorism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his response was,</v>

2394
01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:23.853
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2395
01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:24.753
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it unquestionably is going to </v>

2396
01:53:26.651 --> 01:53:29.530
<v Speaker 2>get directed toward terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how we can,</v>

2397
01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:35.160
<v Speaker 2>how we could have a okayed that given,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given what has been acknowledged,</v>

2398
01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:37.780
<v Speaker 2>what is the benefit of giving them </v>
<v Speaker 2>money?</v>

2401
01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:42.623
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that free trade at the end of </v>

2402
01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:47.220
<v Speaker 2>the day is a really powerful tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2403
01:53:47.770 --> 01:53:49.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the answer to this and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to,</v>

2404
01:53:49.541 --> 01:53:50.374
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to misstate anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is a conversation that we're </v>

2405
01:53:54.431 --> 01:53:55.264
<v Speaker 2>having a could we have not opened up </v>
<v Speaker 2>free trade with Iran and still kept </v>

2406
01:53:59.801 --> 01:54:01.840
<v Speaker 2>their assets frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by that,</v>

2407
01:54:01.870 --> 01:54:03.940
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assets that,</v>

2408
01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:04.803
<v Speaker 2>that now they enter into the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>community that they can sell their oil </v>

2409
01:54:08.230 --> 01:54:10.950
<v Speaker 2>and on an ongoing basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2410
01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:15.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w we'll have free trade with Iran.</v>

2411
01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:17.560
<v Speaker 2>They can spend the money as they see </v>
<v Speaker 2>fit.</v>

2412
01:54:17.561 --> 01:54:20.110
<v Speaker 2>But with regard to the money that's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>frozen,</v>

2413
01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:21.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2414
01:54:21.130 --> 01:54:21.963
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we believe that any of that's going </v>

2415
01:54:24.251 --> 01:54:28.180
<v Speaker 2>to be redirected or directed at </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism,</v>

2416
01:54:28.181 --> 01:54:29.590
<v Speaker 2>why did we do that?</v>

2418
01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:32.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying I W I don't get it.</v>

2419
01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:33.933
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what has been the response by the </v>

2420
01:54:34.601 --> 01:54:35.434
<v Speaker 5>administration?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's this question been </v>

2421
01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:39.760
<v Speaker 5>brought up and what have they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how have they answered it?</v>

2422
01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:41.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the,</v>

2423
01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:43.510
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>

2424
01:54:43.511 --> 01:54:44.350
<v Speaker 2>gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

2425
01:54:44.410 --> 01:54:45.243
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six months ago and Carrie was asked </v>

2426
01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:49.570
<v Speaker 2>cause and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very matter of factly.</v>

2427
01:54:49.571 --> 01:54:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of it's going to get redirected to,</v>

2428
01:54:52.210 --> 01:54:54.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to I think is,</v>

2429
01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:55.613
<v Speaker 2>I'm a secondhand or firsthand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm repeating what I thought I </v>

2430
01:54:58.871 --> 01:55:00.040
<v Speaker 2>heard him say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

2431
01:55:00.041 --> 01:55:00.874
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unquestionably,</v>

2432
01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:03.040
<v Speaker 2>some of this is going to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism.</v>

2433
01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:04.633
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>

2434
01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:06.733
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well we don't have specifics to discuss </v>

2435
01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:10.520
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like specific facts.</v>

2436
01:55:10.670 --> 01:55:12.800
<v Speaker 5>So it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it gets it.</v>

2437
01:55:12.801 --> 01:55:14.510
<v Speaker 5>And we got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got the Internet and going.</v>

2438
01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:15.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we definitely do.</v>

2439
01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:18.590
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what,</v>

2440
01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:23.620
<v Speaker 5>if anything can be done to calm some of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the areas down in the world.</v>

2441
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:25.903
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and how much of what's going on in the </v>

2442
01:55:28.071 --> 01:55:28.904
<v Speaker 5>world is about controlling resources and</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much of that would change if we had </v>

2443
01:55:32.691 --> 01:55:35.030
<v Speaker 5>less reliance on fossil fuels?</v>

2444
01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:36.613
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not getting any of our oil right </v>

2445
01:55:38.091 --> 01:55:40.190
<v Speaker 2>now from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Middle East.</v>

2446
01:55:40.191 --> 01:55:43.080
<v Speaker 2>We're not getting the enacting well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are fracking and,</v>

2447
01:55:43.110 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2448
01:55:44.011 --> 01:55:46.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that statement is not completely true.</v>

2449
01:55:46.231 --> 01:55:49.920
<v Speaker 2>We are getting oil from all over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

2450
01:55:49.921 --> 01:55:50.754
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so our refineries here in the United </v>

2451
01:55:54.730 --> 01:55:55.050
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2452
01:55:55.050 --> 01:55:55.883
<v Speaker 2>so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a trade off where we're x </v>

2453
01:55:57.381 --> 01:55:58.214
<v Speaker 2>sporting really clean oil or oil that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't need as much refining and we're </v>

2454
01:56:04.561 --> 01:56:07.650
<v Speaker 2>importing oil that is dirty so it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheaper.</v>

2455
01:56:07.651 --> 01:56:10.860
<v Speaker 2>So there's a more of a profit margin to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring in dirty oil,</v>

2456
01:56:10.861 --> 01:56:15.861
<v Speaker 2>refine it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make more money by exporting cleaner</v>

2457
01:56:16.831 --> 01:56:21.810
<v Speaker 2>oil that refineries overseas can handle </v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to the United States.</v>

2458
01:56:21.811 --> 01:56:24.330
<v Speaker 2>So there is that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for the most part,</v>

2459
01:56:24.331 --> 01:56:26.730
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're energy sufficient,</v>

2460
01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:28.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the moment because of fracking.</v>

2461
01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:29.753
<v Speaker 5>But when we entered into Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the more cynical concerns was </v>

2462
01:56:32.701 --> 01:56:36.570
<v Speaker 5>that we were doing it because we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to control natural resources.</v>

2463
01:56:36.571 --> 01:56:37.100
<v Speaker 5>We were sure.</v>

2464
01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at that time,</v>

2465
01:56:38.421 --> 01:56:40.070
<v Speaker 2>I think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2466
01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:42.380
<v Speaker 2>did that not play a part in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>equation?</v>

2467
01:56:42.381 --> 01:56:44.870
<v Speaker 2>Certainly the administration denied </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2468
01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:45.733
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2469
01:56:46.370 --> 01:56:50.510
<v Speaker 2>everybody I think saw that for what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was to,</v>

2470
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:52.430
<v Speaker 2>that that was the case.</v>

2471
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:55.750
<v Speaker 5>So when you look at the world in terms </v>
<v Speaker 5>of threats and,</v>

2472
01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:58.180
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imminent danger to the United States,</v>

2473
01:56:58.181 --> 01:57:00.430
<v Speaker 5>like what could be done to try to lessen</v>
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>

2474
01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first and foremost,</v>

2475
01:57:02.921 --> 01:57:06.910
<v Speaker 2>and this is where the Obama </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration has concentrated on,</v>

2476
01:57:06.911 --> 01:57:11.911
<v Speaker 2>and I couldn't tell you the status of </v>
<v Speaker 2>how effective it is a,</v>

2477
01:57:12.010 --> 01:57:14.560
<v Speaker 2>but it is to cut off funding to </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism.</v>

2478
01:57:14.561 --> 01:57:16.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

2479
01:57:16.181 --> 01:57:17.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the goal.</v>

2480
01:57:17.081 --> 01:57:18.760
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

2481
01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:20.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia,</v>

2482
01:57:21.010 --> 01:57:21.843
<v Speaker 5>terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Such a weird word because it's such a </v>

2483
01:57:23.651 --> 01:57:24.484
<v Speaker 5>blanket statement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're not talking about an </v>

2484
01:57:25.931 --> 01:57:28.480
<v Speaker 5>individual nation with an individual </v>
<v Speaker 5>motive,</v>

2485
01:57:28.710 --> 01:57:30.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you say terrorism,</v>

2486
01:57:30.701 --> 01:57:34.630
<v Speaker 5>it's like we have a war on terror.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that really mean?</v>

2487
01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:35.651
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2488
01:57:35.651 --> 01:57:36.580
<v Speaker 5>well they talking about</v>

2489
01:57:37.190 --> 01:57:38.023
<v Speaker 2>in groups and Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Muslims get extremely offended when </v>

2490
01:57:41.151 --> 01:57:44.310
<v Speaker 2>you use the term Islamic terrorism or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Moose,</v>

2491
01:57:44.350 --> 01:57:45.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2492
01:57:45.130 --> 01:57:47.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic terrorism,</v>

2493
01:57:47.211 --> 01:57:48.044
<v Speaker 2>which looking at it from the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does appear as though there is that </v>

2494
01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:53.680
<v Speaker 2>constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2495
01:57:54.230 --> 01:57:55.130
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2496
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Muslims would say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2497
01:57:57.951 --> 01:58:01.160
<v Speaker 2>that's not inherent in the Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>

2498
01:58:01.161 --> 01:58:04.640
<v Speaker 2>which I more than agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2499
01:58:05.150 --> 01:58:05.983
<v Speaker 2>so this is the political correctness </v>
<v Speaker 2>about saying terrorism as opposed to </v>

2500
01:58:10.521 --> 01:58:11.990
<v Speaker 2>Islamic terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2501
01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:13.033
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the terrorist just happened to be </v>

2502
01:58:15.861 --> 01:58:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Islamic does seem to be that common </v>
<v Speaker 2>element,</v>

2503
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:22.500
<v Speaker 2>but is that something that's taught?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2504
01:58:22.580 --> 01:58:25.050
<v Speaker 2>is that something that most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2505
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:27.230
<v Speaker 2>most of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2506
01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:30.920
<v Speaker 2>Muslim religion believes in you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2507
01:58:30.921 --> 01:58:31.970
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2508
01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:36.080
<v Speaker 2>but it does seem to be a common thread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2509
01:58:36.081 --> 01:58:37.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the political,</v>

2510
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:39.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm repeating myself here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2511
01:58:40.730 --> 01:58:41.950
<v Speaker 2>how do calm that down?</v>

2512
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:42.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you,</v>

2513
01:58:42.610 --> 01:58:43.443
<v Speaker 5>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there any way to appease people that </v>

2514
01:58:46.181 --> 01:58:47.590
<v Speaker 5>are so upset at the United States?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2515
01:58:47.591 --> 01:58:48.424
<v Speaker 5>what is their major gripe?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does her major reason for being </v>

2516
01:58:50.531 --> 01:58:52.420
<v Speaker 5>upset with us?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as a president,</v>

2517
01:58:52.450 --> 01:58:54.280
<v Speaker 5>what would you do to try to stop that or</v>

2518
01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:55.853
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you would contain it for at a </v>

2519
01:58:57.271 --> 01:58:58.104
<v Speaker 3>minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd try and contain it to where it's </v>

2520
01:58:59.721 --> 01:59:02.790
<v Speaker 3>at and not allow it to spread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now I'm back to,</v>

2521
01:59:02.791 --> 01:59:03.624
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2522
01:59:03.690 --> 01:59:06.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>military policy defense,</v>

2523
01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:07.633
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having an impenetrable national defense </v>

2524
01:59:09.841 --> 01:59:10.674
<v Speaker 3>that the notion of somehow a dirty bomb </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting over here into the United </v>

2525
01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:14.491
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2526
01:59:14.491 --> 01:59:17.790
<v Speaker 3>that should be a real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real live concern.</v>

2527
01:59:18.530 --> 01:59:19.363
<v Speaker 5>Just getting military operatives though </v>
<v Speaker 5>they believe that a proactive attack or </v>

2528
01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:27.500
<v Speaker 5>proactive action is much more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 5>stop isis or anything nice or,</v>

2529
01:59:30.090 --> 01:59:30.750
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

2530
01:59:30.750 --> 01:59:33.900
<v Speaker 3>and that's been our tact to date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2531
01:59:33.901 --> 01:59:35.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say that,</v>

2532
01:59:35.881 --> 01:59:36.714
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without exception that every one of </v>

2533
01:59:39.751 --> 01:59:44.640
<v Speaker 3>those military interventions have had an</v>
<v Speaker 3>unintended consequence of at best,</v>

2534
01:59:45.090 --> 01:59:45.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2535
01:59:45.491 --> 01:59:46.250
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2536
01:59:46.250 --> 01:59:47.071
<v Speaker 3>we go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2537
01:59:47.071 --> 01:59:49.350
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we always deal with atrocity,</v>

2538
01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:53.340
<v Speaker 3>their atrocities going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We go in to deal with that atrocity.</v>

2539
01:59:53.341 --> 01:59:56.460
<v Speaker 3>And at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new dictator,</v>

2540
01:59:56.461 --> 01:59:59.640
<v Speaker 3>the new desperate that we put into place</v>
<v Speaker 3>to replace the bad,</v>

2541
01:59:59.641 --> 02:00:03.660
<v Speaker 3>desperate at the end of the day is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>as bad or in many cases worse.</v>

2542
02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:07.440
<v Speaker 3>We cut off the head of the Hydra and Lo </v>
<v Speaker 3>and behold,</v>

2543
02:00:07.441 --> 02:00:08.490
<v Speaker 3>they're more heads.</v>

2544
02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:10.720
<v Speaker 5>So how does one stop that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it,</v>

2545
02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:11.573
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you ever tried to come up with some </v>

2546
02:00:12.511 --> 02:00:13.344
<v Speaker 5>sort of a solution or look at some sort </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a long term plan that would somehow </v>

2547
02:00:16.411 --> 02:00:17.244
<v Speaker 5>or another calm the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or at least allow the United States to </v>

2548
02:00:21.301 --> 02:00:22.134
<v Speaker 5>make peace.</v>

2549
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:23.303
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons that I'm seeking to </v>

2550
02:00:24.861 --> 02:00:25.694
<v Speaker 2>become president of United States is I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think I do a really good job of </v>

2551
02:00:28.881 --> 02:00:33.881
<v Speaker 2>presiding over over all the intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we do have regarding all of this.</v>

2552
02:00:35.061 --> 02:00:39.350
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to present myself as having</v>

2553
02:00:39.351 --> 02:00:42.470
<v Speaker 2>the answers as much as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2554
02:00:42.740 --> 02:00:44.870
<v Speaker 2>give me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me the Intel,</v>

2555
02:00:44.900 --> 02:00:45.733
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me be part of this discussion and </v>

2556
02:00:48.351 --> 02:00:49.184
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to enter into this </v>

2557
02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:53.850
<v Speaker 2>discussion as a real skeptic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2558
02:00:53.930 --> 02:00:58.930
<v Speaker 2>on what we've done to this point and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>real skeptic on what appears to be,</v>

2559
02:00:59.031 --> 02:01:02.060
<v Speaker 2>what we're going to do in the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>regarding all of this.</v>

2560
02:01:02.061 --> 02:01:04.670
<v Speaker 2>And isn't there a more effective way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with this?</v>

2561
02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:06.433
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be seeking this job if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I didn't think that I could make a </v>

2562
02:01:10.611 --> 02:01:15.220
<v Speaker 2>difference in it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not want to misstate.</v>

2563
02:01:15.230 --> 02:01:17.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to play cards.</v>

2564
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Obama draws lines in the sand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to draw lines in the sand.</v>

2565
02:01:21.801 --> 02:01:22.634
<v Speaker 2>If you draw any lines in the sand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better be prepared to back up what </v>

2566
02:01:25.281 --> 02:01:26.630
<v Speaker 2>you've said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2567
02:01:26.631 --> 02:01:27.464
<v Speaker 2>with action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's also been an issue with </v>

2568
02:01:29.181 --> 02:01:30.014
<v Speaker 2>Obama.</v>

2569
02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:30.993
<v Speaker 5>How much different do you think </v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective changes once you get into </v>

2570
02:01:34.301 --> 02:01:35.134
<v Speaker 5>office?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once you get into office and you sit </v>

2571
02:01:36.341 --> 02:01:39.040
<v Speaker 5>down with military leaders and you sit </v>
<v Speaker 5>down with someone,</v>

2572
02:01:39.110 --> 02:01:40.160
<v Speaker 5>explains to you</v>

2573
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:40.993
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual landscape you're dealing </v>

2574
02:01:41.931 --> 02:01:42.764
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

2575
02:01:43.230 --> 02:01:44.063
<v Speaker 2>I think he pushed himself too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that perspective can change a </v>

2576
02:01:47.251 --> 02:01:49.800
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how about being transparent?</v>

2577
02:01:49.801 --> 02:01:50.634
<v Speaker 2>How about saying how bout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how bout being transparent with the </v>

2578
02:01:52.951 --> 02:01:53.784
<v Speaker 2>American public?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about educating the American public </v>

2579
02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:59.040
<v Speaker 2>to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Intel that does exist.</v>

2580
02:01:59.120 --> 02:01:59.953
<v Speaker 4>It's a wooden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they possibly alert the enemy that we </v>

2581
02:02:01.651 --> 02:02:02.484
<v Speaker 4>have knowledge of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some things they may or may not know we </v>

2582
02:02:04.021 --> 02:02:04.720
<v Speaker 4>have knowledge of</v>

2583
02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:05.553
<v Speaker 2>and that you certain danger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you certainly wouldn't want to cross </v>

2584
02:02:07.771 --> 02:02:10.770
<v Speaker 2>over that line in any way whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2585
02:02:10.830 --> 02:02:11.663
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've got elected to office saying </v>

2586
02:02:13.501 --> 02:02:14.334
<v Speaker 2>that we should not militarily intervene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that military interventions have an </v>

2587
02:02:17.491 --> 02:02:21.780
<v Speaker 2>unintended consequence and then the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>day you militarily intervene somewhere,</v>

2588
02:02:21.781 --> 02:02:25.470
<v Speaker 2>you better darn well get up in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the American public and take the,</v>

2589
02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:30.150
<v Speaker 2>take the eggs and tomatoes or,</v>

2590
02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:31.273
<v Speaker 4>or worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was your take when Obama went on </v>

2591
02:02:33.351 --> 02:02:34.184
<v Speaker 4>television and was talking about how we </v>
<v Speaker 4>needed to invade Syria and Syria was a </v>

2592
02:02:39.021 --> 02:02:39.854
<v Speaker 4>huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the American public was up in </v>

2593
02:02:41.091 --> 02:02:42.860
<v Speaker 4>arms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both the right and the left people like,</v>

2594
02:02:42.861 --> 02:02:45.080
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is craziness.</v>

2595
02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:46.333
<v Speaker 4>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the administration backed off and we </v>

2596
02:02:48.051 --> 02:02:48.771
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

2597
02:02:48.771 --> 02:02:49.604
<v Speaker 4>my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was one of the first that was </v>

2598
02:02:51.411 --> 02:02:52.630
<v Speaker 4>drawing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

2599
02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:53.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's okay.</v>

2600
02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:56.960
<v Speaker 4>But it was one of the first examples of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States,</v>

2601
02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:57.913
<v Speaker 4>like sort of collectively the will of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people like being openly expressed </v>

2602
02:03:01.821 --> 02:03:04.700
<v Speaker 4>that the idea of entering Syria was </v>
<v Speaker 4>outrageous.</v>

2603
02:03:04.701 --> 02:03:07.010
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wanted to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't make any sense to people.</v>

2604
02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:07.993
<v Speaker 4>This gas attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how is this any more horrible than </v>

2605
02:03:10.191 --> 02:03:12.620
<v Speaker 4>a lot of shit that's going on all over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world all the time.</v>

2606
02:03:12.621 --> 02:03:13.454
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it about Syria that all of a </v>

2607
02:03:15.021 --> 02:03:15.854
<v Speaker 4>sudden we have to go and invade Syria?</v>
<v Speaker 4>One more intervention in one more </v>

2608
02:03:18.711 --> 02:03:21.830
<v Speaker 4>country in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Admit the administration backed off.</v>

2609
02:03:22.410 --> 02:03:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great example.</v>

2610
02:03:23.850 --> 02:03:26.160
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are fed up with this and the fact</v>

2611
02:03:26.161 --> 02:03:26.820
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2612
02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:27.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>22 million people in Syria and 11 </v>

2613
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:32.640
<v Speaker 2>million of them have been displaced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't we?</v>

2614
02:03:33.210 --> 02:03:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Don't we have a share?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in that consequence,</v>

2615
02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:37.890
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was the motivation?</v>

2616
02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:38.873
<v Speaker 4>What was the motivation for the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States wanted to invade their in the </v>

2617
02:03:40.261 --> 02:03:41.094
<v Speaker 4>first place?</v>

2618
02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:42.173
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't it a mccain going over there </v>

2619
02:03:44.641 --> 02:03:46.770
<v Speaker 2>and beating his chest and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2620
02:03:46.771 --> 02:03:47.790
<v Speaker 2>along with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2621
02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Lindsey Graham and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2622
02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:52.350
<v Speaker 2>and let's go over there and support the </v>
<v Speaker 2>good guys.</v>

2623
02:03:52.351 --> 02:03:53.184
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the good guys are the minority and the </v>

2624
02:03:54.631 --> 02:03:58.290
<v Speaker 2>good guys at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2625
02:03:58.650 --> 02:04:03.420
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where the somehow we're going to</v>

2626
02:04:03.421 --> 02:04:05.370
<v Speaker 2>determine the outcomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2627
02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:07.140
<v Speaker 2>in other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2628
02:04:07.141 --> 02:04:09.720
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's preposterous that,</v>

2629
02:04:09.721 --> 02:04:12.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as individuals we can do that.</v>

2630
02:04:12.410 --> 02:04:16.850
<v Speaker 4>But this seems so contrary to what Obama</v>
<v Speaker 4>stood for before he got an office.</v>

2631
02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:19.640
<v Speaker 4>So when he gets on television and talks </v>
<v Speaker 4>about intervening,</v>

2632
02:04:19.641 --> 02:04:21.350
<v Speaker 4>going over to Syria about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2633
02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:24.610
<v Speaker 4>there's gas attacks and all this jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like where,</v>

2634
02:04:24.611 --> 02:04:26.060
<v Speaker 4>where's that motivation coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2635
02:04:26.061 --> 02:04:28.670
<v Speaker 4>who's behind him pushing him into this </v>
<v Speaker 4>direction?</v>

2636
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:31.850
<v Speaker 4>Or is this just how he's been the entire</v>
<v Speaker 4>time?</v>

2637
02:04:31.851 --> 02:04:32.684
<v Speaker 4>And we just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just sold us a song and dance before </v>

2638
02:04:34.491 --> 02:04:35.420
<v Speaker 4>he got into office.</v>

2639
02:04:36.030 --> 02:04:36.541
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2640
02:04:36.541 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 2>you off this,</v>

2641
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:41.510
<v Speaker 5>this kind of line of thought by saying </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

2642
02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:42.413
<v Speaker 5>this is where I thought you were headed </v>
<v Speaker 5>was can you get in and not be co opted </v>

2643
02:04:46.021 --> 02:04:47.610
<v Speaker 5>by the system?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2644
02:04:48.090 --> 02:04:52.290
<v Speaker 5>based on my ex only experience having </v>
<v Speaker 5>been governor of New Mexico.</v>

2645
02:04:52.291 --> 02:04:53.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't,</v>

2646
02:04:53.610 --> 02:04:57.960
<v Speaker 5>meaning you can go that good government </v>
<v Speaker 5>was easy.</v>

2647
02:04:57.961 --> 02:05:01.230
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't hard that you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you weren't co-opted.</v>

2648
02:05:01.590 --> 02:05:04.920
<v Speaker 5>There was plenty of cooption that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2649
02:05:04.921 --> 02:05:08.220
<v Speaker 5>that tried to wield itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know what?</v>

2650
02:05:08.221 --> 02:05:09.870
<v Speaker 5>You're the president of the United </v>
<v Speaker 5>States.</v>

2651
02:05:09.871 --> 02:05:11.520
<v Speaker 5>You're the governor of a state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2652
02:05:11.521 --> 02:05:13.440
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're at the top of the pyramid.</v>

2653
02:05:13.470 --> 02:05:14.131
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

2654
02:05:14.131 --> 02:05:17.610
<v Speaker 5>you do have limited powers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but even with those limited powers,</v>

2655
02:05:17.611 --> 02:05:19.740
<v Speaker 5>you're still the most powerful human </v>
<v Speaker 5>being on earth.</v>

2656
02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:20.773
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a pretty radical difference </v>

2657
02:05:21.801 --> 02:05:22.634
<v Speaker 5>between being a governor of a state </v>
<v Speaker 5>without a military and being the </v>

2658
02:05:24.651 --> 02:05:25.484
<v Speaker 5>president of the United States dealing </v>
<v Speaker 5>not just with the same sort of problems </v>

2659
02:05:29.691 --> 02:05:33.110
<v Speaker 5>that you dealt with as a governor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but on a much larger scale,</v>

2660
02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:34.033
<v Speaker 5>plus the problems of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>plus the military plus the weird stuff </v>

2661
02:05:37.491 --> 02:05:40.770
<v Speaker 5>like the NSA and the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the NSA.</v>

2662
02:05:40.850 --> 02:05:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it has to be extremely more complex.</v>

2663
02:05:45.651 --> 02:05:47.150
<v Speaker 2>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>

2664
02:05:47.180 --> 02:05:52.180
<v Speaker 2>can you still tell the truth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you still admit mistakes?</v>

2665
02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2666
02:05:54.321 --> 02:05:55.154
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're willing to tell the truth and </v>

2667
02:05:56.151 --> 02:05:56.984
<v Speaker 2>you're willing to admit mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mistakes seemed to have a way of </v>

2668
02:05:59.601 --> 02:06:00.434
<v Speaker 2>compounding themselves when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>admit the mistakes as in lieu of </v>

2669
02:06:03.201 --> 02:06:06.230
<v Speaker 2>admitting the mistakes and then taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrective action.</v>

2670
02:06:06.710 --> 02:06:07.543
<v Speaker 2>But really at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it boil down to telling the </v>

2671
02:06:10.371 --> 02:06:11.204
<v Speaker 2>truth and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fessing up to mistakes and fixing </v>

2672
02:06:13.531 --> 02:06:14.130
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

2673
02:06:14.130 --> 02:06:16.680
<v Speaker 5>I would think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it seems to me that the,</v>

2674
02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:17.993
<v Speaker 5>the wiring of the office is so complex </v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's so much craziness going on </v>

2675
02:06:23.251 --> 02:06:24.084
<v Speaker 5>that no one gets in office and does what</v>
<v Speaker 5>they said they were going to do before </v>

2676
02:06:27.271 --> 02:06:31.290
<v Speaker 5>they got an office because I'm almost </v>
<v Speaker 5>seem insurmountable.</v>

2677
02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:35.360
<v Speaker 5>That was not my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was not mine.</v>

2678
02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:38.550
<v Speaker 5>As a governor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>governors have done what they've,</v>

2679
02:06:38.890 --> 02:06:39.810
<v Speaker 5>they've pledged.</v>

2680
02:06:39.850 --> 02:06:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So would you rather,</v>

2681
02:06:42.221 --> 02:06:43.054
<v Speaker 2>would you rather elect someone who has </v>
<v Speaker 2>had the experience of not having been </v>

2682
02:06:47.240 --> 02:06:48.480
<v Speaker 2>co-opted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2683
02:06:48.670 --> 02:06:49.503
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to somebody who has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooptive want one wants someone that's </v>

2684
02:06:54.971 --> 02:06:58.060
<v Speaker 2>been cooptive at the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will I be,</v>

2685
02:06:58.090 --> 02:06:58.923
<v Speaker 2>would I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm elected president United States </v>

2686
02:07:00.611 --> 02:07:01.444
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would I be able to make that same </v>

2687
02:07:03.131 --> 02:07:04.300
<v Speaker 2>statement?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>

2688
02:07:04.301 --> 02:07:05.134
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2689
02:07:05.210 --> 02:07:07.700
<v Speaker 5>that's the best way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's an honest way to put it.</v>

2690
02:07:07.730 --> 02:07:09.500
<v Speaker 5>You hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause it just,</v>

2691
02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:11.480
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really would like to know.</v>

2692
02:07:11.481 --> 02:07:12.314
<v Speaker 5>I would love it if you became president </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we could stay friends and I could </v>

2693
02:07:14.721 --> 02:07:15.554
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

2694
02:07:15.620 --> 02:07:17.160
<v Speaker 5>I won't tell anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2695
02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:18.380
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll tell.</v>

2696
02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:20.630
<v Speaker 5>We'll tell the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell them on back here.</v>

2697
02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:22.520
<v Speaker 5>We'll tell the world I don't want to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>shot with you.</v>

2698
02:07:23.050 --> 02:07:26.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm to run away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

2699
02:07:27.150 --> 02:07:27.983
<v Speaker 5>it's just the whole thing seems so </v>
<v Speaker 5>almost impossibly intertwined that it's </v>

2700
02:07:34.551 --> 02:07:36.220
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go fishing.</v>

2701
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:37.083
<v Speaker 4>You ever go fishing?</v>

2702
02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:38.020
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2703
02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:40.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm on my mountain bike as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fishing.</v>

2704
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:42.700
<v Speaker 3>I do have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a sidelight.</v>

2705
02:07:42.701 --> 02:07:45.160
<v Speaker 3>I do have a stream running through my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2706
02:07:45.250 --> 02:07:46.083
<v Speaker 3>right by my house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have 1600 feet of frontage on the </v>

2707
02:07:50.140 --> 02:07:52.300
<v Speaker 3>Hondo River and it's loaded with </v>
<v Speaker 3>taxpayer trout.</v>

2708
02:07:52.330 --> 02:07:54.280
<v Speaker 3>So give me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give you an invitation to come.</v>

2709
02:07:54.281 --> 02:07:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2710
02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:57.160
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful Stream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be like probably fly fishing,</v>

2711
02:07:57.161 --> 02:07:57.994
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2712
02:07:58.120 --> 02:07:59.520
<v Speaker 4>what I'm talking about is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2713
02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:00.573
<v Speaker 4>there's a thing called the bird's nest </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a business is when you use a bait </v>

2714
02:08:03.461 --> 02:08:08.461
<v Speaker 4>casting reel and the line spools quicker</v>
<v Speaker 4>than it can roll over it and it gets it,</v>

2715
02:08:08.860 --> 02:08:13.510
<v Speaker 4>it becomes this gigantic tangle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you,</v>

2716
02:08:13.630 --> 02:08:16.360
<v Speaker 4>when you use a bait casting really </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to sort of regulate it,</v>

2717
02:08:16.361 --> 02:08:19.420
<v Speaker 4>at least the old school ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you regulate the amount of pressure with</v>

2718
02:08:19.421 --> 02:08:21.220
<v Speaker 4>your thumb as to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2719
02:08:21.250 --> 02:08:22.960
<v Speaker 4>how fast the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wheel turns.</v>

2720
02:08:23.020 --> 02:08:23.853
<v Speaker 4>The wheel turns too quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That line gets so tangled and it almost </v>

2721
02:08:26.141 --> 02:08:27.760
<v Speaker 4>becomes impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look at it and you go,</v>

2722
02:08:27.761 --> 02:08:29.080
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what am I going to do with it?</v>

2723
02:08:29.110 --> 02:08:31.150
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a perfect image.</v>

2724
02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:32.193
<v Speaker 4>That's what a bird's nest looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see how all the line is all just </v>

2725
02:08:35.890 --> 02:08:36.440
<v Speaker 4>deal with it.</v>

2726
02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:37.750
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Try getting through that.</v>

2727
02:08:37.780 --> 02:08:40.360
<v Speaker 4>That's a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See when I think of the government,</v>

2728
02:08:40.361 --> 02:08:44.170
<v Speaker 4>I think of like that with bullets that </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2729
02:08:44.171 --> 02:08:49.171
<v Speaker 4>this is almost like the analogy branches</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's almost like it's so tangled and</v>

2730
02:08:50.621 --> 02:08:53.080
<v Speaker 4>with all the other variables that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussed,</v>

2731
02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:56.890
<v Speaker 4>terms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>term limitations that are,</v>

2732
02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:58.560
<v Speaker 4>that aren't in place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2733
02:08:58.630 --> 02:08:59.463
<v Speaker 4>ideological blockades on the left and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the right supporting your constituents </v>

2734
02:09:03.221 --> 02:09:05.950
<v Speaker 4>on the left and the right special </v>
<v Speaker 4>interest groups,</v>

2735
02:09:06.010 --> 02:09:07.840
<v Speaker 4>lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that there's,</v>

2736
02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:09.273
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's this one area outside of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Washington dc that is just all </v>

2737
02:09:13.451 --> 02:09:14.650
<v Speaker 4>lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2738
02:09:14.651 --> 02:09:15.484
<v Speaker 4>these neighborhoods and it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wealthiest parts of the area and it's </v>

2739
02:09:18.311 --> 02:09:19.144
<v Speaker 4>just because people are making insane </v>
<v Speaker 4>amounts of money manipulating the </v>

2740
02:09:21.191 --> 02:09:22.024
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>

2741
02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:23.120
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2742
02:09:23.170 --> 02:09:24.003
<v Speaker 3>I am advocating eliminating income tax </v>
<v Speaker 3>and corporate tax and as a result of </v>

2743
02:09:28.781 --> 02:09:29.614
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

2744
02:09:30.150 --> 02:09:30.983
<v Speaker 4>hit the brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you just say you were talking about </v>

2745
02:09:35.490 --> 02:09:37.610
<v Speaker 4>lobbyists?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2746
02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:40.170
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How are you going to do that?</v>

2747
02:09:41.210 --> 02:09:42.043
<v Speaker 3>Eliminate income tax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eliminate corporate tax because you're </v>

2748
02:09:44.871 --> 02:09:45.704
<v Speaker 3>going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to also be able to abolish </v>

2749
02:09:47.811 --> 02:09:51.200
<v Speaker 3>the irs and you can read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2750
02:09:51.201 --> 02:09:54.650
<v Speaker 3>you just hear me out here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a radical boulevard.</v>

2751
02:09:54.750 --> 02:09:55.583
<v Speaker 3>You hear me out a couple more minutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we would replace all of that with </v>

2752
02:09:59.781 --> 02:10:03.470
<v Speaker 3>one federal consumption tax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now how do you do that?</v>

2753
02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:05.420
<v Speaker 3>While there's an actual proposal out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2754
02:10:05.421 --> 02:10:07.780
<v Speaker 3>it's called the fair tax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2755
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:08.623
<v Speaker 3>and it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you dot the i's and cross the t's </v>

2756
02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:16.340
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to establishing one </v>
<v Speaker 3>federal consumption tax.</v>

2757
02:10:17.060 --> 02:10:20.330
<v Speaker 3>If we had zero corporate tax in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

2758
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:25.990
<v Speaker 3>I believe tens of millions of jobs would</v>
<v Speaker 3>get created if we did not have corporate</v>

2759
02:10:26.751 --> 02:10:29.450
<v Speaker 3>tax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we did not have income tax,</v>

2760
02:10:29.451 --> 02:10:34.451
<v Speaker 3>I believe that pink slips would get </v>
<v Speaker 3>issued to 80 of Washington</v>

2761
02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:38.990
<v Speaker 1>lobbyists because that's why they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to garner special tax favor.</v>

2762
02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:40.850
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about,</v>

2763
02:10:41.490 --> 02:10:44.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage and really that amounts to tax</v>

2764
02:10:44.991 --> 02:10:45.824
<v Speaker 1>money spent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how does this consumption tax work </v>

2765
02:10:49.431 --> 02:10:50.264
<v Speaker 1>and how would you possibly implement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you possibly get anyone to </v>

2766
02:10:54.741 --> 02:10:57.530
<v Speaker 1>agree to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To get rid of the irs,</v>

2767
02:10:57.531 --> 02:10:59.480
<v Speaker 1>to get rid of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2768
02:10:59.481 --> 02:11:04.481
<v Speaker 1>actually come to a couple hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple hundred congressmen and women,</v>

2769
02:11:04.650 --> 02:11:07.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe 160 have actually signed on to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this proposal.</v>

2770
02:11:07.911 --> 02:11:10.310
<v Speaker 1>So this proposal's been around for quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>a while.</v>

2771
02:11:10.610 --> 02:11:12.740
<v Speaker 1>And how many oppose it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2772
02:11:12.741 --> 02:11:13.640
<v Speaker 1>you got what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many?</v>

2773
02:11:13.641 --> 02:11:17.040
<v Speaker 1>400 f well by pose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily opposed,</v>

2774
02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:18.620
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't signed on,</v>

2775
02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:19.573
<v Speaker 1>haven't signed on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that would be more than half have </v>

2776
02:11:21.651 --> 02:11:24.320
<v Speaker 1>not signed on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a significant number have.</v>

2777
02:11:24.321 --> 02:11:26.810
<v Speaker 1>So it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been vetted.</v>

2778
02:11:26.811 --> 02:11:27.890
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's out there.</v>

2779
02:11:27.950 --> 02:11:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this consumption tax,</v>

2780
02:11:29.851 --> 02:11:31.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does this work?</v>

2781
02:11:31.490 --> 02:11:35.090
<v Speaker 1>It would be a 28% consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tossed the board on,</v>

2782
02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:38.720
<v Speaker 1>on all new goods and services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not used goods and services.</v>

2783
02:11:38.721 --> 02:11:41.450
<v Speaker 1>And before you fall off the chair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theory,</v>

2784
02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:44.150
<v Speaker 1>the theory is that it wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily,</v>

2785
02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:45.013
<v Speaker 1>it would be cost neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I could use a can of coke as an </v>

2786
02:11:48.891 --> 02:11:51.980
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can of coke that sells for a buck today,</v>

2787
02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:53.473
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a corporate tax contained in that </v>

2788
02:11:55.821 --> 02:11:58.010
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has unemployment,</v>

2789
02:11:58.030 --> 02:11:58.863
<v Speaker 1>a contained in that book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has social security match contained </v>

2790
02:12:01.911 --> 02:12:02.744
<v Speaker 1>in that book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has medicare a contained in that </v>

2791
02:12:05.421 --> 02:12:09.290
<v Speaker 1>dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has the accounting fees and the legal</v>

2792
02:12:09.291 --> 02:12:13.670
<v Speaker 1>fees that go along with complying with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the irs and the filing with the irs.</v>

2793
02:12:14.090 --> 02:12:17.420
<v Speaker 1>So arguably the can of coke would not </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell for a buck.</v>

2794
02:12:17.421 --> 02:12:18.254
<v Speaker 1>It would sell for 73 cents and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>28% tax would get applied to the can of </v>

2795
02:12:23.481 --> 02:12:23.780
<v Speaker 1>coke.</v>

2796
02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:26.540
<v Speaker 1>So you'd still end up paying a buck for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the can of coke.</v>

2797
02:12:26.930 --> 02:12:27.763
<v Speaker 1>That's the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by doing this and eliminating income </v>

2798
02:12:31.821 --> 02:12:32.654
<v Speaker 1>tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much different would the amount be </v>

2799
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:39.740
<v Speaker 1>that the government receives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is intended to be revenue neutral,</v>

2800
02:12:40.670 --> 02:12:41.503
<v Speaker 1>revenue neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So governments still gonna receive the </v>

2801
02:12:43.371 --> 02:12:45.200
<v Speaker 1>same amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

2802
02:12:45.260 --> 02:12:47.690
<v Speaker 1>that's also the projection that how's </v>
<v Speaker 1>that possible?</v>

2803
02:12:47.691 --> 02:12:48.524
<v Speaker 1>The people are not paying income tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say if someone's wealthy filling out </v>

2804
02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:53.930
<v Speaker 1>$1 million a year and you know $1 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million a year,</v>

2805
02:12:53.931 --> 02:12:54.764
<v Speaker 1>you're probably in a 48% tax bracket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take away all your tax shelters and all </v>

2806
02:12:58.491 --> 02:13:00.290
<v Speaker 1>the various ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations,</v>

2807
02:13:00.291 --> 02:13:01.550
<v Speaker 1>llcs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that jazz.</v>

2808
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:03.530
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the 30s probably,</v>

2809
02:13:03.531 --> 02:13:04.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of money.</v>

2810
02:13:04.821 --> 02:13:08.030
<v Speaker 1>That's $300,000 so how much money are </v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

2811
02:13:08.060 --> 02:13:08.893
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to welding that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that if you're making a lot of </v>

2812
02:13:11.421 --> 02:13:12.830
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you spend a lot of money,</v>

2813
02:13:12.831 --> 02:13:15.950
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to pay that money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption tax,</v>

2814
02:13:16.490 --> 02:13:18.350
<v Speaker 1>scrooge mcduck and you just hanging </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

2815
02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that's a way that you can,</v>

2816
02:13:20.830 --> 02:13:23.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't there a fairness in that?</v>

2817
02:13:23.031 --> 02:13:26.600
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is the more people make </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to money,</v>

2818
02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:30.050
<v Speaker 1>the more people spend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to save your money,</v>

2819
02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:32.580
<v Speaker 1>when you say new and used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that apply to homes?</v>

2820
02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a new home,</v>

2821
02:13:34.590 --> 02:13:37.320
<v Speaker 1>you would have to pay 38% that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to uphold the whole market,</v>

2822
02:13:37.590 --> 02:13:38.423
<v Speaker 1>28% that would cripple the home market </v>
<v Speaker 1>because no one would want to buy a new </v>

2823
02:13:41.731 --> 02:13:42.060
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

2824
02:13:42.060 --> 02:13:44.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm back to back to the theory.</v>

2825
02:13:44.401 --> 02:13:47.280
<v Speaker 2>The right now you've got the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

2826
02:13:47.281 --> 02:13:50.010
<v Speaker 2>when you enlist the aid of the plumbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

2827
02:13:50.011 --> 02:13:52.920
<v Speaker 2>the plumbing company has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so first of all,</v>

2828
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:55.400
<v Speaker 2>no more payroll deductions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2829
02:13:55.980 --> 02:13:58.210
<v Speaker 2>the social security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2830
02:13:58.330 --> 02:14:00.390
<v Speaker 2>unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2831
02:14:00.930 --> 02:14:01.763
<v Speaker 2>medicare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that would come out of the </v>

2832
02:14:03.421 --> 02:14:04.254
<v Speaker 2>proceeds of one federal consumption tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all government proceeds would come </v>

2833
02:14:10.141 --> 02:14:14.730
<v Speaker 2>from this new pot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just a sales tax.</v>

2834
02:14:14.731 --> 02:14:17.940
<v Speaker 2>So instead of the plumber on your home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2835
02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:22.710
<v Speaker 2>giving you a $100,000 bill for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plumbing,</v>

2836
02:14:22.750 --> 02:14:23.583
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretically the bill will be 73 grand </v>

2837
02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:29.060
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not the,</v>

2838
02:14:29.210 --> 02:14:29.730
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2839
02:14:29.730 --> 02:14:33.540
<v Speaker 2>the theory is the house really isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to cost you any more.</v>

2840
02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:34.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2841
02:14:34.891 --> 02:14:35.880
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2842
02:14:35.881 --> 02:14:38.970
<v Speaker 2>all these hidden taxes that exist are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go away.</v>

2843
02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds cute.</v>

2844
02:14:42.810 --> 02:14:44.520
<v Speaker 1>It's theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2845
02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:47.070
<v Speaker 2>and let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me also just say,</v>

2846
02:14:47.130 --> 02:14:47.963
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking to get elected president of </v>

2847
02:14:49.501 --> 02:14:50.880
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2848
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:55.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to sign on to what I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to make anything better.</v>

2849
02:14:55.650 --> 02:14:59.820
<v Speaker 2>But when you talk about making things </v>
<v Speaker 2>really better,</v>

2850
02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:04.140
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a proposal that </v>
<v Speaker 2>simplifies all of our lives in a,</v>

2851
02:15:04.141 --> 02:15:06.920
<v Speaker 2>in a huge way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine not having to</v>

2852
02:15:06.980 --> 02:15:09.380
<v Speaker 1>deal with the irs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be tremendous,</v>

2853
02:15:09.381 --> 02:15:10.214
<v Speaker 1>but you would also put all those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of jobs and they're going to fight </v>

2854
02:15:13.431 --> 02:15:14.270
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to,</v>

2855
02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:16.370
<v Speaker 1>they're going to charge it against that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a job.</v>

2856
02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:17.110
<v Speaker 1>That would be</v>

2857
02:15:17.110 --> 02:15:19.440
<v Speaker 2>the accounting and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

2858
02:15:19.441 --> 02:15:20.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2859
02:15:20.401 --> 02:15:21.234
<v Speaker 2>attorney fees that go along with </v>
<v Speaker 2>complying with the irs and the irs </v>

2860
02:15:24.391 --> 02:15:25.470
<v Speaker 2>employees themselves.</v>

2861
02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:28.100
<v Speaker 1>And if you think about the pressure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the police unions or the,</v>

2862
02:15:28.101 --> 02:15:28.934
<v Speaker 1>the guard unions rather prison guard </v>
<v Speaker 1>unions put to make sure that marijuana </v>

2863
02:15:32.211 --> 02:15:35.690
<v Speaker 1>is still remains illegal and drug laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>remained in place,</v>

2864
02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:36.733
<v Speaker 1>imagine the kind of pressure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lobbyists and the irs and anyone else </v>

2865
02:15:40.131 --> 02:15:40.964
<v Speaker 1>that might be affected by these </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions are going to put to try to </v>

2866
02:15:42.441 --> 02:15:44.000
<v Speaker 1>stop this from happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2867
02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:45.193
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this though would be a dialogue if you </v>

2868
02:15:47.841 --> 02:15:49.520
<v Speaker 1>had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>

2869
02:15:49.521 --> 02:15:50.354
<v Speaker 1>Gary Johnson onstage in the presidential</v>
<v Speaker 1>debates talking about something like </v>

2870
02:15:54.261 --> 02:15:55.770
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2871
02:15:56.090 --> 02:15:59.600
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm maybe open people's eyes to the</v>

2872
02:15:59.601 --> 02:16:03.920
<v Speaker 1>fact that Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life could change dramatically.</v>

2873
02:16:04.190 --> 02:16:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Some would argue for the better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at the end of the day you would,</v>

2874
02:16:07.730 --> 02:16:11.900
<v Speaker 1>you can argue that this would make life </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot better for everybody.</v>

2875
02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll certainly stimulate a dialogue,</v>

2876
02:16:15.201 --> 02:16:18.230
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder if you can get that point </v>
<v Speaker 1>across and those little soundbites it do</v>

2877
02:16:18.231 --> 02:16:19.760
<v Speaker 1>in those debates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

2878
02:16:20.500 --> 02:16:21.333
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tens of millions of jobs would get </v>

2879
02:16:25.181 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 2>created overnight here in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States because of a zero tax rate.</v>

2880
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why would you,</v>

2881
02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:32.613
<v Speaker 1>why would you create a job anywhere in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world other than the United States </v>

2882
02:16:36.041 --> 02:16:40.510
<v Speaker 1>given zero corporate taxes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think that like apple would move,</v>

2883
02:16:40.511 --> 02:16:43.270
<v Speaker 1>their iphone factors are paying people 5</v>
<v Speaker 1>cents an hour.</v>

2884
02:16:43.271 --> 02:16:44.104
<v Speaker 1>They'd move into the United States and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to pay a working wage because they </v>

2885
02:16:46.571 --> 02:16:49.240
<v Speaker 1>don't have to pay corporate taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't they cancel each other out?</v>

2886
02:16:49.270 --> 02:16:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be more profitable to still </v>
<v Speaker 1>invoke foreign labor and use third world</v>

2887
02:16:54.251 --> 02:16:55.084
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they would have to pay that </v>

2888
02:16:56.051 --> 02:16:58.570
<v Speaker 1>corporate tax in that foreign country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2889
02:16:58.600 --> 02:16:59.530
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's minimal,</v>

2890
02:16:59.531 --> 02:17:00.021
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2891
02:17:00.021 --> 02:17:00.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not me.</v>

2892
02:17:00.700 --> 02:17:03.540
<v Speaker 1>It's not minimal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's less so now.</v>

2893
02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:05.380
<v Speaker 1>But now I'm back to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2894
02:17:05.381 --> 02:17:06.214
<v Speaker 1>I get elected president of United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sue and I get legislation </v>

2895
02:17:09.580 --> 02:17:11.770
<v Speaker 1>submitted to reduce corporate tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2896
02:17:11.771 --> 02:17:12.604
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sign on to that because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it really is a hindrance to job </v>

2897
02:17:16.031 --> 02:17:19.120
<v Speaker 1>creation when we have the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate tax rate.</v>

2898
02:17:19.540 --> 02:17:22.840
<v Speaker 1>But imagine instead of having a debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>

2899
02:17:23.410 --> 02:17:24.243
<v Speaker 1>should we reduce the corporate tax rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>to 28% or 29% and Republicans and </v>

2900
02:17:28.561 --> 02:17:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Democrats both get their peacock </v>
<v Speaker 1>feathers all up in arms,</v>

2901
02:17:32.081 --> 02:17:35.920
<v Speaker 1>about 29 or 28 or 27 well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about zero?</v>

2902
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:39.190
<v Speaker 1>How about doing away with the irs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>

2903
02:17:39.610 --> 02:17:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>

2904
02:17:40.861 --> 02:17:42.490
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if lowering it is good.</v>

2905
02:17:42.491 --> 02:17:44.740
<v Speaker 1>How about eliminating it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2906
02:17:44.890 --> 02:17:48.610
<v Speaker 1>I think you would get universal support </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the United States.</v>

2907
02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:49.473
<v Speaker 1>I mean from people in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ask people how much do they love </v>

2908
02:17:52.061 --> 02:17:55.120
<v Speaker 1>the United States irs system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would say zero.</v>

2909
02:17:55.570 --> 02:17:56.403
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's a single person </v>

2910
02:17:57.130 --> 02:17:58.900
<v Speaker 1>other than people who work for the irs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>

2911
02:17:58.930 --> 02:18:00.520
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're awesome.</v>

2912
02:18:00.521 --> 02:18:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I love when they go after your bank </v>
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>

2913
02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:03.900
<v Speaker 1>I love when they take all your money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2914
02:18:03.901 --> 02:18:04.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

2915
02:18:04.871 --> 02:18:06.270
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2916
02:18:06.300 --> 02:18:06.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2917
02:18:06.550 --> 02:18:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll drop the,</v>

2918
02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I'll drop the thought completely because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the love that does exist for the irs.</v>

2919
02:18:12.191 --> 02:18:13.420
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No what I'm saying,</v>

2920
02:18:13.421 --> 02:18:14.390
<v Speaker 1>no one loves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2921
02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:15.670
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what I'm saying.</v>

2922
02:18:15.790 --> 02:18:16.623
<v Speaker 1>I do mean everyone hates it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everyone wouldn't hate you would get </v>

2923
02:18:18.641 --> 02:18:20.650
<v Speaker 1>a hundred percent support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2924
02:18:20.651 --> 02:18:21.940
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing.</v>

2925
02:18:22.990 --> 02:18:25.360
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>

2926
02:18:26.220 --> 02:18:28.280
<v Speaker 1>but obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how about the how,</v>

2927
02:18:28.290 --> 02:18:29.470
<v Speaker 1>how about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2928
02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:31.660
<v Speaker 1>how about this entering into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2929
02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:34.240
<v Speaker 1>the debate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2930
02:18:34.241 --> 02:18:35.880
<v Speaker 1>What would be a great thing to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

2931
02:18:35.890 --> 02:18:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Because the system is not good and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thinks it is.</v>

2932
02:18:38.801 --> 02:18:42.130
<v Speaker 1>So the idea of keeping it exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way it is seems pretty ridiculous,</v>

2933
02:18:42.310 --> 02:18:42.761
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2934
02:18:42.761 --> 02:18:43.594
<v Speaker 1>that's like the definition of insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the same thing over and over </v>

2935
02:18:45.731 --> 02:18:47.260
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expecting different results.</v>

2936
02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:49.090
<v Speaker 1>It's crony capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2937
02:18:49.091 --> 02:18:49.924
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those that have money pay less of their </v>

2938
02:18:52.961 --> 02:18:53.790
<v Speaker 1>share.</v>

2939
02:18:53.790 --> 02:18:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this really at the,</v>

2940
02:18:55.721 --> 02:18:58.210
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day is very fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2941
02:18:58.390 --> 02:19:01.840
<v Speaker 1>So thinking of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and along those lines,</v>

2942
02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:07.240
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel about corporations </v>
<v Speaker 1>donating to political candidates?</v>

2943
02:19:07.930 --> 02:19:12.100
<v Speaker 1>I have no issue with corporations </v>
<v Speaker 1>donating to political candidates.</v>

2944
02:19:12.101 --> 02:19:12.934
<v Speaker 1>But the problem today is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are these super pacs that are 100% </v>

2945
02:19:17.350 --> 02:19:18.183
<v Speaker 1>nontransparent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea who's contributing to </v>

2946
02:19:21.071 --> 02:19:25.420
<v Speaker 1>these superpacs make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make for unlimited contribution.</v>

2947
02:19:25.421 --> 02:19:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Just make the contributions hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent transparent.</v>

2948
02:19:28.550 --> 02:19:31.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one that said candidate should </v>
<v Speaker 1>wear,</v>

2949
02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:32.553
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nascar like jackets with that was Robin </v>

2950
02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Williams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

2951
02:19:36.110 --> 02:19:37.280
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was me.</v>

2952
02:19:37.281 --> 02:19:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he got it from me.</v>

2953
02:19:39.050 --> 02:19:41.690
<v Speaker 1>He used to do a hit a bit about it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>hbo show.</v>

2954
02:19:41.691 --> 02:19:43.910
<v Speaker 1>He didn't go to sleep with the TV on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2955
02:19:43.911 --> 02:19:47.690
<v Speaker 1>I think I had this first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I do have this first.</v>

2956
02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what the year was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do google it.</v>

2957
02:19:49.730 --> 02:19:50.563
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2958
02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:52.100
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no deal.</v>

2959
02:19:52.100 --> 02:19:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Google it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2960
02:19:53.191 --> 02:19:55.400
<v Speaker 1>it's Robin Williams ripped you off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be brutal.</v>

2961
02:19:55.430 --> 02:19:56.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

2962
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:58.320
<v Speaker 1>There's no rip off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might have,</v>

2963
02:19:58.460 --> 02:20:02.930
<v Speaker 1>but this would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been saying this in 2009.</v>

2964
02:20:03.500 --> 02:20:05.630
<v Speaker 1>I think he might've got ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe so,</v>

2965
02:20:05.631 --> 02:20:06.660
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2966
02:20:06.890 --> 02:20:10.580
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not infringing on his stuff.</v>

2967
02:20:10.610 --> 02:20:14.330
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was original.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to think of special was in 2006.</v>

2968
02:20:14.390 --> 02:20:15.223
<v Speaker 1>I want to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you might be parallel </v>

2969
02:20:18.051 --> 02:20:18.884
<v Speaker 1>thinking it doesn't mean yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem with intellectual </v>

2970
02:20:22.791 --> 02:20:26.300
<v Speaker 1>property is a weight look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's parallel thinking,</v>

2971
02:20:26.430 --> 02:20:29.210
<v Speaker 1>certainly I'm not the only other one </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

2972
02:20:29.300 --> 02:20:30.133
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there are probably a hundred </v>

2973
02:20:31.701 --> 02:20:33.140
<v Speaker 1>people listening right now that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

2974
02:20:33.141 --> 02:20:35.420
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that first 100%.</v>

2975
02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty obvious connection,</v>

2976
02:20:37.551 --> 02:20:38.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see Nascar,</v>

2977
02:20:38.511 --> 02:20:39.344
<v Speaker 1>they're all covered with logos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stands out and you know who's </v>

2978
02:20:41.751 --> 02:20:43.190
<v Speaker 1>sponsoring or the logo.</v>

2979
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:44.023
<v Speaker 1>The more money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more money was controlling the </v>

2980
02:20:45.471 --> 02:20:46.610
<v Speaker 1>direct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

2981
02:20:46.611 --> 02:20:46.881
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2982
02:20:46.881 --> 02:20:50.810
<v Speaker 1>the direct comparison because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most obvious sponsor thing.</v>

2983
02:20:50.811 --> 02:20:53.030
<v Speaker 1>The car sponsored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their jackets are sponsored,</v>

2984
02:20:53.031 --> 02:20:55.070
<v Speaker 1>everything's covered in logos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2985
02:20:55.071 --> 02:20:56.870
<v Speaker 1>if you look at basketball players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't see that,</v>

2986
02:20:56.900 --> 02:20:57.733
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very rare that you see any sort of </v>

2987
02:20:59.991 --> 02:21:02.330
<v Speaker 1>a sporting event where they're covered </v>
<v Speaker 1>with logos like that.</v>

2988
02:21:02.331 --> 02:21:03.164
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what year that's coming this next </v>

2989
02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:06.553
<v Speaker 1>season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the NBA is adding all those logos </v>

2990
02:21:07.551 --> 02:21:10.250
<v Speaker 1>to all their things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing one.</v>

2991
02:21:10.480 --> 02:21:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're earning one logo.</v>

2992
02:21:12.111 --> 02:21:16.280
<v Speaker 1>And this is a way was actually argued </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the reebok deal for the UFC.</v>

2993
02:21:17.170 --> 02:21:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2994
02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:19.673
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get real concerned with a superpacs </v>

2995
02:21:22.220 --> 02:21:23.053
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get real concerned with money and </v>

2996
02:21:25.101 --> 02:21:25.934
<v Speaker 1>politics and that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the reasons why Bernie </v>

2997
02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Sanders has stood out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cause he's the only guy that is not</v>

2998
02:21:32.931 --> 02:21:33.764
<v Speaker 1>really accepting money from these giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations and he's fairly self </v>

2999
02:21:36.711 --> 02:21:37.460
<v Speaker 1>funded.</v>

3000
02:21:37.460 --> 02:21:38.293
<v Speaker 1>One of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the misconceptions about a </v>

3001
02:21:39.890 --> 02:21:40.723
<v Speaker 1>campaign finances is that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>misconceptions is that if you limit </v>

3002
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:45.703
<v Speaker 1>campaign contribution that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that things are going to get better and </v>

3003
02:21:50.510 --> 02:21:51.343
<v Speaker 1>you're going to eliminate the influence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of big money when the reality is by </v>

3004
02:21:54.501 --> 02:21:57.260
<v Speaker 1>limiting campaign contribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You basically,</v>

3005
02:21:57.261 --> 02:22:02.261
<v Speaker 1>that's an incumbency protection act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So limiting campaign contribution is all</v>

3006
02:22:04.431 --> 02:22:07.490
<v Speaker 1>about reelecting incumbents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's all about.</v>

3007
02:22:08.210 --> 02:22:09.043
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

3008
02:22:09.620 --> 02:22:12.740
<v Speaker 1>if you could get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody would finance me to the tune</v>

3009
02:22:12.741 --> 02:22:13.574
<v Speaker 1>of $1 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might change this country in a </v>

3010
02:22:16.551 --> 02:22:20.540
<v Speaker 1>really big way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should the billion dollars be anonymous?</v>

3011
02:22:20.570 --> 02:22:21.403
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it should be front and </v>

3012
02:22:22.671 --> 02:22:25.800
<v Speaker 1>center and whom ever contributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should be known</v>

3013
02:22:26.490 --> 02:22:29.120
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that a,</v>

3014
02:22:29.130 --> 02:22:34.130
<v Speaker 2>their goal was to change America and by </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving Gary Johnson a billion bucks,</v>

3015
02:22:34.850 --> 02:22:37.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the opportunity to do that,</v>

3016
02:22:37.860 --> 02:22:38.693
<v Speaker 2>that it just be transparent as opposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to having to take 500,000 contributions </v>

3017
02:22:45.541 --> 02:22:47.500
<v Speaker 2>at $2,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3018
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:49.950
<v Speaker 2>which has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has,</v>

3019
02:22:49.980 --> 02:22:53.430
<v Speaker 2>which at the end of the day has more of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a corrupting influence,</v>

3020
02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:54.513
<v Speaker 5>more of a corrupting influence and one </v>
<v Speaker 5>super rich person that wants to </v>

3021
02:22:56.651 --> 02:22:58.210
<v Speaker 5>influence your decision making.</v>

3022
02:22:58.240 --> 02:22:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3023
02:22:59.020 --> 02:23:00.850
<v Speaker 2>as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>governor of New Mexico,</v>

3024
02:23:00.851 --> 02:23:05.620
<v Speaker 2>my number one contributor of for two for</v>
<v Speaker 2>two terms,</v>

3025
02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:08.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave me $150,000.</v>

3026
02:23:08.170 --> 02:23:09.850
<v Speaker 2>May sound cheap too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people,</v>

3027
02:23:09.910 --> 02:23:12.630
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't sound cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like a guy with a lot of money</v>

3028
02:23:12.631 --> 02:23:14.240
<v Speaker 5>you can throw 150 grand your way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3029
02:23:14.430 --> 02:23:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Eh,</v>

3030
02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:18.630
<v Speaker 2>over an eight year old girl over an </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight year period.</v>

3031
02:23:18.660 --> 02:23:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

3032
02:23:21.780 --> 02:23:26.130
<v Speaker 2>he was never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not once did he call for anything.</v>

3033
02:23:26.280 --> 02:23:29.460
<v Speaker 2>There was never any requests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's about rare though.</v>

3034
02:23:29.461 --> 02:23:31.080
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3035
02:23:31.470 --> 02:23:33.680
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point is,</v>

3036
02:23:33.681 --> 02:23:34.514
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I would have had a thousand </v>

3037
02:23:36.030 --> 02:23:37.560
<v Speaker 2>contributors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3038
02:23:37.980 --> 02:23:40.530
<v Speaker 2>giving me 150.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3039
02:23:40.531 --> 02:23:41.364
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>$1,500 get a hundred people giving me </v>

3040
02:23:44.911 --> 02:23:45.744
<v Speaker 2>$1,500.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee a Joe that 10 of them at </v>

3041
02:23:49.351 --> 02:23:50.980
<v Speaker 2>some point would have been on the phone</v>

3042
02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:52.430
<v Speaker 5>wanting something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3043
02:23:52.431 --> 02:23:53.580
<v Speaker 5>Guarantee it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3044
02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:54.930
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3045
02:23:54.980 --> 02:23:55.940
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3046
02:23:56.030 --> 02:23:57.320
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty anecdotal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't know.</v>

3047
02:23:57.680 --> 02:23:58.513
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about one contributor </v>

3048
02:23:59.511 --> 02:24:01.790
<v Speaker 5>versus if you're looking at someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>who's,</v>

3049
02:24:01.791 --> 02:24:05.180
<v Speaker 5>or who's trying to contribute though to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the United States,</v>

3050
02:24:05.181 --> 02:24:08.270
<v Speaker 5>to someone running for the United States</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if they give you $1 billion,</v>

3051
02:24:08.271 --> 02:24:11.270
<v Speaker 5>one person who gives you $1 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy's going to want some,</v>

3052
02:24:11.660 --> 02:24:13.940
<v Speaker 5>he's gonna want something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think,</v>

3053
02:24:13.941 --> 02:24:14.720
<v Speaker 5>I really don't think it's that.</v>

3054
02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:16.340
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

3055
02:24:16.370 --> 02:24:19.700
<v Speaker 2>let's use a more realistic term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A billionaire that wants a,</v>

3056
02:24:19.701 --> 02:24:20.534
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a multibillionaire that wants to give </v>

3057
02:24:21.801 --> 02:24:25.130
<v Speaker 2>$10 million bill gates or someone like </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like that.</v>

3058
02:24:25.180 --> 02:24:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

3059
02:24:26.340 --> 02:24:28.160
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

3060
02:24:28.820 --> 02:24:29.653
<v Speaker 2>is it inconceivable that there is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there aren't a whole bunch of those </v>

3061
02:24:33.471 --> 02:24:34.304
<v Speaker 2>people out there that would just be </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for good government and just be </v>

3062
02:24:38.091 --> 02:24:38.924
<v Speaker 2>looking to back that the candidate of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their choice based on what it was they </v>

3063
02:24:42.441 --> 02:24:43.390
<v Speaker 2>were saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not On,</v>

3064
02:24:43.690 --> 02:24:46.490
<v Speaker 2>not on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's inconceivable at all,</v>

3065
02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:50.840
<v Speaker 2>but just let's all know who that </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributor was and how much money.</v>

3066
02:24:51.570 --> 02:24:52.403
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand that the transparency </v>

3067
02:24:54.361 --> 02:24:56.250
<v Speaker 5>aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that sort of makes sense.</v>

3068
02:24:56.251 --> 02:24:57.084
<v Speaker 5>But boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having one person that influences </v>

3069
02:24:59.550 --> 02:25:01.800
<v Speaker 5>politics that much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's concerning.</v>

3070
02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:03.840
<v Speaker 5>It concerns people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think rightly so,</v>

3071
02:25:03.841 --> 02:25:07.980
<v Speaker 5>because someone who has that much money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who they are,</v>

3072
02:25:07.981 --> 02:25:11.460
<v Speaker 5>they're already in this very strong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>advantageous position.</v>

3073
02:25:11.461 --> 02:25:16.461
<v Speaker 5>And the only reason why you would </v>
<v Speaker 5>rationally give someone $1 billion is if</v>

3074
02:25:16.471 --> 02:25:18.690
<v Speaker 5>you thought that it was going to be an </v>
<v Speaker 5>advantage to you.</v>

3075
02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:21.870
<v Speaker 5>You are going to somehow or another reap</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rewards of giving them that money.</v>

3076
02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:23.890
<v Speaker 5>Good government.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3077
02:25:23.970 --> 02:25:24.340
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3078
02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:25.173
<v Speaker 2>in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never been involved in politics </v>

3079
02:25:27.371 --> 02:25:29.440
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>running for governor of New Mexico.</v>

3080
02:25:29.470 --> 02:25:31.350
<v Speaker 2>Never knew businessman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful,</v>

3081
02:25:31.351 --> 02:25:34.090
<v Speaker 2>but never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never even pounded in a campaign sign.</v>

3082
02:25:34.180 --> 02:25:35.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did I get elected?</v>

3083
02:25:35.530 --> 02:25:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I paid for my own campaign.</v>

3084
02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my primary,</v>

3085
02:25:39.071 --> 02:25:41.410
<v Speaker 2>this is gonna sound really cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my primary,</v>

3086
02:25:41.411 --> 02:25:42.244
<v Speaker 2>the first time was $540,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>510 of it was mine and 30 and </v>

3087
02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:50.530
<v Speaker 2>motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just good government.</v>

3088
02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:51.393
<v Speaker 2>The note it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the notion of life and what do you do </v>

3089
02:25:53.081 --> 02:25:55.810
<v Speaker 2>with your life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>

3090
02:25:55.811 --> 02:25:57.490
<v Speaker 2>my entire life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3091
02:25:57.820 --> 02:25:59.140
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3092
02:25:59.170 --> 02:26:01.090
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I viewed it as a high calling.</v>

3093
02:26:01.150 --> 02:26:01.983
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the notion of being in a position to </v>

3094
02:26:03.731 --> 02:26:04.990
<v Speaker 2>make things better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

3095
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:06.663
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the first person to also admit that </v>

3096
02:26:07.931 --> 02:26:11.460
<v Speaker 2>if you had people lined up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if you ask,</v>

3097
02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:12.963
<v Speaker 2>asked how many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many are going to line up here to </v>

3098
02:26:14.501 --> 02:26:16.570
<v Speaker 2>say Gary Johnson was a scourge of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

3099
02:26:16.570 --> 02:26:17.171
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3100
02:26:17.171 --> 02:26:18.004
<v Speaker 2>there'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd be lines blocks long out out </v>

3101
02:26:20.351 --> 02:26:21.310
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

3102
02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:22.173
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you try and do their main criticism </v>

3103
02:26:23.591 --> 02:26:24.830
<v Speaker 2>be no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3104
02:26:24.970 --> 02:26:25.803
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you'd actually have that </v>

3105
02:26:27.251 --> 02:26:28.084
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's always criticism regardless </v>

3106
02:26:30.221 --> 02:26:31.054
<v Speaker 2>of what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the motivation for what I've done </v>

3107
02:26:34.001 --> 02:26:38.740
<v Speaker 2>always is to make things better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are always people that,</v>

3108
02:26:38.900 --> 02:26:41.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have something contrary to say,</v>

3109
02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:43.360
<v Speaker 2>no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3110
02:26:43.361 --> 02:26:46.060
<v Speaker 2>you could write an article about soccer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to have 100 people,</v>

3111
02:26:46.061 --> 02:26:47.080
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3112
02:26:47.081 --> 02:26:49.360
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't have to go out and raise any</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

3113
02:26:49.361 --> 02:26:51.790
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave him the money to myself.</v>

3114
02:26:51.820 --> 02:26:52.653
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't you extend that argument and </v>

3115
02:26:54.341 --> 02:26:55.174
<v Speaker 2>say that if somebody would've given me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if one person would have given me that </v>

3116
02:26:58.871 --> 02:26:59.704
<v Speaker 2>same $510,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that person wouldn't have changed </v>

3117
02:27:03.701 --> 02:27:04.930
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3118
02:27:05.050 --> 02:27:05.883
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My contributor that gave me 150 grand </v>

3119
02:27:07.930 --> 02:27:09.960
<v Speaker 2>for good government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he,</v>

3120
02:27:09.980 --> 02:27:11.880
<v Speaker 2>he had the ability to write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3121
02:27:11.890 --> 02:27:14.590
<v Speaker 2>he had the ability to give 510 grand </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3122
02:27:14.650 --> 02:27:17.870
<v Speaker 2>and essentially get me elected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't</v>

3123
02:27:18.100 --> 02:27:20.020
<v Speaker 5>been.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that a good thing?</v>

3124
02:27:20.380 --> 02:27:21.213
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's only a good thing if it's a good </v>

3125
02:27:21.851 --> 02:27:24.400
<v Speaker 5>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we don't know that it's a good guy.</v>

3126
02:27:24.401 --> 02:27:25.234
<v Speaker 5>We just know it's a rich guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the amount of influence of that one </v>

3127
02:27:27.611 --> 02:27:28.444
<v Speaker 5>rich person has is very problematic to </v>
<v Speaker 5>regular pan should be part of the </v>

3128
02:27:31.511 --> 02:27:32.344
<v Speaker 5>equation on the analysis of is this </v>
<v Speaker 5>having an impact and who is it and how </v>

3129
02:27:36.431 --> 02:27:38.560
<v Speaker 5>much money have they given,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which currently,</v>

3130
02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:40.780
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these super pacs,</v>

3131
02:27:40.810 --> 02:27:43.510
<v Speaker 5>100% non transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3132
02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:46.360
<v Speaker 5>But do you think the transparency </v>
<v Speaker 5>protects you from influence?</v>

3133
02:27:46.420 --> 02:27:49.480
<v Speaker 5>Like if it is transparent and you have </v>
<v Speaker 5>like one of the Koch brothers,</v>

3134
02:27:49.481 --> 02:27:50.880
<v Speaker 5>it's given all the money up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

3135
02:27:51.100 --> 02:27:51.933
<v Speaker 5>even if it's transparent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what the hell their motivation </v>

3136
02:27:54.131 --> 02:27:56.470
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want to continue to extract massive</v>

3137
02:27:56.471 --> 02:27:57.340
<v Speaker 5>amounts of money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3138
02:27:57.430 --> 02:27:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3139
02:27:58.210 --> 02:28:00.580
<v Speaker 2>if it's one person that's giving all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

3140
02:28:00.581 --> 02:28:01.414
<v Speaker 2>then there's that much more scrutiny </v>
<v Speaker 2>that goes along with that person giving </v>

3141
02:28:04.391 --> 02:28:06.550
<v Speaker 2>that much more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3142
02:28:06.630 --> 02:28:08.590
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to think,</v>

3143
02:28:09.130 --> 02:28:10.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3144
02:28:10.121 --> 02:28:10.954
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the influence wouldn't be as blatant as </v>

3145
02:28:12.581 --> 02:28:14.950
<v Speaker 2>it was if it was completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>nontransparent.</v>

3146
02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:17.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a little skeptical.</v>

3147
02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:19.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm also right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's okay.</v>

3148
02:28:19.490 --> 02:28:20.323
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what did you think when the Supreme </v>

3149
02:28:21.100 --> 02:28:22.070
<v Speaker 5>Court,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the decision to allow</v>

3150
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:24.710
<v Speaker 1>corporations to donate as if they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals?</v>

3151
02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:26.750
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make much sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3152
02:28:26.770 --> 02:28:29.480
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the motivation was for</v>

3153
02:28:29.481 --> 02:28:31.730
<v Speaker 1>that though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they pass something like that?</v>

3154
02:28:33.690 --> 02:28:36.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am too far in the weeds,</v>

3155
02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:39.170
<v Speaker 1>but they did it and it just doesn't make</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sense.</v>

3156
02:28:39.290 --> 02:28:40.610
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of creepy though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

3157
02:28:40.740 --> 02:28:41.571
<v Speaker 1>A little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3158
02:28:41.571 --> 02:28:43.970
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like what you're saying.</v>

3159
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I really liked this idea of abolishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the irs a consumption tax.</v>

3160
02:28:47.841 --> 02:28:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I love the Iga of the fair tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out the fair tax and,</v>

3161
02:28:52.251 --> 02:28:54.530
<v Speaker 1>and there are no fair taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I say,</v>

3162
02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:59.210
<v Speaker 1>dot the i's and cross the t's on how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplish one federal consumption tax.</v>

3163
02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:01.310
<v Speaker 1>To wrap this up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to give you the floor.</v>

3164
02:29:01.490 --> 02:29:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Just sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell it to the American people.</v>

3165
02:29:04.491 --> 02:29:05.324
<v Speaker 1>What is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can be fixed and what can Gary </v>

3166
02:29:07.850 --> 02:29:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Johnson do to fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

3167
02:29:08.810 --> 02:29:10.810
<v Speaker 3>want to make a pitch for myself and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3168
02:29:10.811 --> 02:29:14.480
<v Speaker 3>is that I think I really am a unique </v>
<v Speaker 3>package.</v>

3169
02:29:14.540 --> 02:29:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am fiscally conservative.</v>

3170
02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:18.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3171
02:29:18.490 --> 02:29:21.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm as frugal a human being as you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever met,</v>

3172
02:29:21.890 --> 02:29:22.723
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that I'm cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just means that I spend my money </v>

3173
02:29:26.001 --> 02:29:28.970
<v Speaker 3>wisely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to serve as governor of New Mexico</v>

3174
02:29:28.971 --> 02:29:31.300
<v Speaker 3>for two terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3175
02:29:31.310 --> 02:29:32.143
<v Speaker 3>I served as governor of New Mexico for </v>
<v Speaker 3>two terms as a Republican in the state </v>

3176
02:29:35.841 --> 02:29:36.674
<v Speaker 3>that's two to one democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got reelected by a bigger margin the </v>

3177
02:29:39.291 --> 02:29:40.124
<v Speaker 3>second time than the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Made a name for myself as a real </v>

3178
02:29:43.971 --> 02:29:44.804
<v Speaker 3>government skeptic vetoing legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I may have vetoed more legislation than </v>

3179
02:29:48.141 --> 02:29:50.780
<v Speaker 3>the other 49 governors in the country </v>
<v Speaker 3>combined.</v>

3180
02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:53.150
<v Speaker 3>Coupled with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3181
02:29:53.570 --> 02:29:56.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm socially tolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm socially liberal.</v>

3182
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:57.463
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I should be able to make </v>

3183
02:29:58.581 --> 02:29:59.414
<v Speaker 3>decisions in our own lives that only </v>
<v Speaker 3>affect our own lives as long as those </v>

3184
02:30:03.501 --> 02:30:06.350
<v Speaker 3>decisions don't adversely affect others.</v>

3185
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:10.760
<v Speaker 3>And then there is a very real terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 3>threat out there.</v>

3186
02:30:10.761 --> 02:30:12.490
<v Speaker 3>It exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3187
02:30:12.830 --> 02:30:13.663
<v Speaker 3>but I do believe that our military </v>
<v Speaker 3>interventions have resulted in making </v>

3188
02:30:17.781 --> 02:30:19.700
<v Speaker 3>situations worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not better.</v>

3189
02:30:19.701 --> 02:30:20.534
<v Speaker 3>So I'm a real skeptic when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>government and the fact that government </v>

3190
02:30:23.960 --> 02:30:26.660
<v Speaker 3>is too big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3191
02:30:26.661 --> 02:30:29.480
<v Speaker 3>I've been an entrepreneur my entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

3192
02:30:29.481 --> 02:30:30.314
<v Speaker 3>I know what it is to a hire and fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what it is to share in the </v>

3193
02:30:33.921 --> 02:30:34.754
<v Speaker 3>profits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what a magic formula that is that </v>

3194
02:30:36.981 --> 02:30:37.814
<v Speaker 3>when you share in the profits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazingly the profit pie grows </v>

3195
02:30:41.151 --> 02:30:43.460
<v Speaker 3>significantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3196
02:30:43.461 --> 02:30:48.461
<v Speaker 3>I've been an athlete my entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bit of an oxymoron is a 63 year old,</v>

3197
02:30:48.531 --> 02:30:51.530
<v Speaker 3>but what athletics has taught me is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3198
02:30:51.531 --> 02:30:54.440
<v Speaker 3>life is putting one foot in front of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

3199
02:30:54.441 --> 02:30:58.580
<v Speaker 3>Athletics has taught me that anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can go wrong will go wrong.</v>

3200
02:30:59.420 --> 02:31:03.800
<v Speaker 3>It's how you deal with failure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately determines your success.</v>

3201
02:31:04.880 --> 02:31:06.680
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things go wrong all the time.</v>

3202
02:31:06.681 --> 02:31:08.580
<v Speaker 3>You can crawl up on the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3203
02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:11.420
<v Speaker 3>you can declare yourself a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can give up,</v>

3204
02:31:11.421 --> 02:31:12.254
<v Speaker 3>or you can recognize that that's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of life and wake up the next day </v>

3205
02:31:15.531 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 3>with a smile on your face and continue </v>
<v Speaker 3>to move forward and just do your</v>

3206
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:22.200
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've told,</v>

3207
02:31:22.410 --> 02:31:24.260
<v Speaker 2>I've told the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3208
02:31:24.261 --> 02:31:27.750
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really hard to do any </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage to somebody who's willing to tell</v>

3209
02:31:27.751 --> 02:31:30.030
<v Speaker 2>the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of the consequences.</v>

3210
02:31:30.031 --> 02:31:34.230
<v Speaker 2>And then I admit mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think mistakes have a way of,</v>

3211
02:31:34.260 --> 02:31:38.550
<v Speaker 2>so compounding themselves just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't acknowledge those mistakes.</v>

3212
02:31:38.551 --> 02:31:43.551
<v Speaker 2>So given this pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I want to do is just get in,</v>

3213
02:31:43.890 --> 02:31:44.723
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the polls that determines who is in the </v>

3214
02:31:48.061 --> 02:31:48.894
<v Speaker 2>presidential debates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that if I'm in the presidential </v>

3215
02:31:52.141 --> 02:31:52.974
<v Speaker 2>debates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an opportunity of actually </v>

3216
02:31:54.451 --> 02:31:59.451
<v Speaker 2>winning because of this package that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've allowed me to present here today.</v>

3217
02:32:00.900 --> 02:32:01.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

3218
02:32:01.930 --> 02:32:03.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate you coming on,</v>

3219
02:32:03.071 --> 02:32:03.910
<v Speaker 4>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>
