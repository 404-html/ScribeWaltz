00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want queefs.</v>

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't break for queets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.070
<v Speaker 1>like you're fucking going and you hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and they sort of want to stop</v>

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.500
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like I'm driving on the highway</v>

5
00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:12.334
<v Speaker 1>and someone goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

6
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.390
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you this.</v>

7
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Did he push you when they're on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>period?</v>

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

9
00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 1>but as I got older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

10
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.060
<v Speaker 1>don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to fuck chicks with Shane a lot.</v>

11
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.720
<v Speaker 1>And how dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would accidentally touch dicks</v>

12
00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one time I was just like,</v>

13
00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.500
<v Speaker 1>that operation game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was fucking a girl in her</v>

14
00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:34.501
<v Speaker 1>ass and it went into her current and</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually went into his condom inside.</v>

15
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking down at her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How looses his condom?</v>

16
00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:37.960
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A fucking trash bag.</v>

17
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.490
<v Speaker 1>I was harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make sense,</v>

18
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.140
<v Speaker 1>at least resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm looking down at Man,</v>

19
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.560
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God on got inside his condom.</v>

20
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So using the condom ever believes me</v>

21
00:00:46.751 --> 00:00:49.150
<v Speaker 1>about this container so that you guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>could rub dicks together.</v>

22
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.410
<v Speaker 1>But that wasn't the plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was,</v>

23
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.620
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking bitches ass.</v>

24
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.770
<v Speaker 1>And I looked down and I see an asshole</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

25
00:00:56.771 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>how many apples does this woman assuming</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in,</v>

26
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 1>at least one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I reached down and I feel a</v>

27
00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:03.970
<v Speaker 1>condom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How drunk were you guys?</v>

28
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Not Drunk at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

29
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.030
<v Speaker 1>how did you not know where you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting your Dick?</v>

30
00:01:07.031 --> 00:01:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Don't you look?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you looking at on the ass?</v>

31
00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:13.540
<v Speaker 1>You're pushing and pushing and pushing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you sort of feel that it</v>

32
00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:15.190
<v Speaker 1>slipped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd go,</v>

33
00:01:15.191 --> 00:01:16.570
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that must have gone into a hole.</v>

34
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>The one that was pushing this girl doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole time.</v>

35
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Calling with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Sutherland.</v>

36
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Invasion of the body snatchers.</v>

37
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got to Dixon and vaginas.</v>

38
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking hoster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

39
00:01:29.651 --> 00:01:31.810
<v Speaker 1>she was from Malta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to wrap this up on a,</v>

40
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.160
<v Speaker 1>on a high note like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're out of time at the end of the</v>

41
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

42
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:37.430
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

43
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.740
<v Speaker 1>I've reached down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

44
00:01:38.741 --> 00:01:41.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a condom on and I have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>condom on and then I pull out and I</v>

45
00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 1>busted out on her butt and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

46
00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:47.050
<v Speaker 1>but you touched a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're doing that kind of</v>

47
00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:49.450
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like two mobsters digging a hole</v>

48
00:01:49.451 --> 00:01:52.480
<v Speaker 1>for a body and their shovels clink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't fucking know</v>

49
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.020
<v Speaker 2>where you're at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

50
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

51
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 2>I want them to get you wrap that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

52
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Tight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know I had a revelation the other</v>

53
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 2>day when it came to movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

54
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 2>I went to see the Martian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty good.</v>

55
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is,</v>

56
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that movie is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

57
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:11.160
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

58
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:14.550
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna make it so it's like someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave you a spoiler alert before you even</v>

59
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 2>got to the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

60
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he going to die on Mars?</v>

61
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Am I paying money to watch two hours of</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and he's going to die on Mars.</v>

62
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows he's not going to die on</v>

63
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 2>Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the revelation was there's,</v>

64
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.580
<v Speaker 2>there's too many movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like even really awesome movies like</v>

65
00:02:32.581 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Sicario is supposed to be pretty bad ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the new Benicio Del Toro</v>

66
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.180
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

67
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be pretty bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we couldn't get a ticket to that</v>

68
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in time.</v>

69
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

70
00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 2>we were sold out so we went with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martian.</v>

71
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is these movies never stop</v>

72
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 2>every week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's new ones and they don't go away.</v>

73
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Like the old ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't stop being around like you can go</v>

74
00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 2>watch them too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's too many of them.</v>

75
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Like I was thinking about all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>different movies just on itunes and</v>

76
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Netflix and I was scrolling through them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I started thinking like,</v>

77
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a never ending equation.</v>

78
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Like it just keeps getting tacked onto</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

79
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 2>We live in the epicenter of where it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>created.</v>

80
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 2>It's all around here and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange because the body of</v>

81
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 2>work just never stops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he used to be when I was a kid.</v>

82
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 2>When a good movie came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would go to see that fucking movie,</v>

83
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 2>like Star Wars.</v>

84
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.860
<v Speaker 2>I saw star wars 13 times and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing compared to the real geeks.</v>

85
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was like,</v>

86
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 2>it was a big deal back then to see how</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times you could see a movie,</v>

87
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 2>like you couldn't run a movie long</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to see for someone to see it 13</v>

88
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 2>times now because there's new ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's new ones come in,</v>

89
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 2>we've got to get this fucking piece of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit out of the theater.</v>

90
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 2>You would never have a movie like star</v>
<v Speaker 2>wars.</v>

91
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 2>It played over and over and over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over again.</v>

92
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.080
<v Speaker 2>And if star wars came out today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would shit right in it's mouth.</v>

93
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

94
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 2>That is to me in my childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest movies of all time</v>

95
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid and that movie came</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

96
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.800
<v Speaker 2>I remember when Obi wan Kenobi was</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to Luke Skywalker and uh,</v>

97
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 2>they were in the sand.</v>

98
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the greatest thing I've ever</v>

99
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 2>seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is amazing.</v>

100
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 2>This guy's in space and he's gonna Obi</v>
<v Speaker 2>wan Kenobi is going to teach them how to</v>

101
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 2>be a jet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

102
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.590
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the greatest movie ever.</v>

103
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 2>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It couldn't have been more perfect.</v>

104
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 2>I remember seeing that movie and</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

105
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:33.850
<v Speaker 2>this movie is fucking perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you go watch and you're like,</v>

106
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a clunky Turd.</v>

107
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 2>It's clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The special effects look like shit.</v>

108
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.240
<v Speaker 2>Why has darth vader evil?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he,</v>

109
00:04:41.241 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 2>does he just not even a reason why he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil?</v>

110
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 2>He's just evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does he get when he takes over the</v>

111
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 2>world is even get pussy is even going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get any pussy in space.</v>

112
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 2>He know he's just building some giant</v>
<v Speaker 2>star that can blow up planets.</v>

113
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so dumb.</v>

114
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Like it's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So it's so fucking dumb.</v>

117
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

118
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.430
<v Speaker 1>and it's puppets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like kermit the frog and Skywalker.</v>

119
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.680
<v Speaker 1>But in its day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you judge it in the context of</v>

120
00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:10.260
<v Speaker 1>its day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the all time classic films.</v>

121
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.590
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many more now and they're</v>

122
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:16.020
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you are a fighter,</v>

123
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.970
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to have opponent,</v>

124
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.090
<v Speaker 1>but this time the opponent is yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

125
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.700
<v Speaker 1>and you know it from the inside and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel it from the inside and it makes you</v>

126
00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:30.330
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you strong and makes you</v>

127
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:33.750
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what we have lost from the</v>

128
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.980
<v Speaker 1>nature and now it's back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

129
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.610
<v Speaker 1>so in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you've done is you tapped into</v>

130
00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:45.150
<v Speaker 1>something extremely primal by dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with one of the most primal elements at</v>

131
00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:46.680
<v Speaker 1>all of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is cold.</v>

132
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the cold in the vice documentary,</v>

133
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said cold is your God.</v>

134
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

135
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.310
<v Speaker 1>If I had a teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a teacher that's,</v>

136
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.620
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Know Guru or mentor or Sifu or</v>

137
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:06.824
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

138
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 2>The cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my teacher.</v>

139
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 2>That's my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been dodging the colts and tells a</v>

140
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:14.350
<v Speaker 2>little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

141
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 2>You just felt compelled to jump into</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

142
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

143
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 2>And what was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're saying this to people when</v>

144
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 2>you're 31 years old and you're telling</v>
<v Speaker 2>people I can control my immune system,</v>

145
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 2>that they must have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out of your fucking mind.</v>

146
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Look at this guy's jumping into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>freezing water and he says he can</v>

147
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 2>control his immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you convince people to the point</v>

148
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 2>that you got actual scientist to measure</v>
<v Speaker 2>your blood?</v>

149
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Do legitimate scientific studies on you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what was it your accomplishments</v>

150
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:49.090
<v Speaker 2>like you went for people that don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

151
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 2>you did a bunch of really unbelievable</v>
<v Speaker 2>tasks.</v>

152
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.860
<v Speaker 2>You climbed everest in your shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

153
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 2>did you have shoes on when you climbed</v>
<v Speaker 2>everest?</v>

154
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to with spikes.</v>

155
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Spikes climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

156
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

157
00:07:04.561 --> 00:07:09.561
<v Speaker 1>Showed on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I go and buy clothes.</v>

158
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.940
<v Speaker 1>It's insane because it's like you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not challenging nature.</v>

159
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.480
<v Speaker 1>You can go up with with their car as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

160
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 1>And then you'll go up everest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything artificial you use in nature</v>

161
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.560
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make you having the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>connection with nature.</v>

162
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.000
<v Speaker 1>And what I wanted to challenge in all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the challenges I did,</v>

163
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.690
<v Speaker 1>like marathons beyond the polar circle</v>
<v Speaker 1>in midwinter short,</v>

164
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.550
<v Speaker 1>but also in the heat of the desert</v>
<v Speaker 1>without drinking or hanging by one</v>

165
00:07:41.551 --> 00:07:44.230
<v Speaker 1>finger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one slash Columbia,</v>

166
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.390
<v Speaker 1>or like a mile up in the air in winter</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

167
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.180
<v Speaker 1>You hung up by one finger a mile up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>

168
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.043
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

169
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Where was this alternate holidays</v>
<v Speaker 1>between two hot air balloons and then</v>

170
00:07:56.821 --> 00:07:59.580
<v Speaker 1>climbing between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a,</v>

171
00:07:59.581 --> 00:08:00.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing,</v>

172
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.960
<v Speaker 1>a device I could looked it on with one</v>
<v Speaker 1>finger.</v>

173
00:08:03.961 --> 00:08:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long did you hang there for?</v>

174
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.640
<v Speaker 1>A 25 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five seconds.</v>

175
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.990
<v Speaker 1>And with one finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in wintertime,</v>

176
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.130
<v Speaker 1>winter time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:08:14.131 --> 00:08:18.210
<v Speaker 1>you lose control when the blood becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>colder into hands,</v>

178
00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.820
<v Speaker 1>you lose control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was the challenge.</v>

179
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:25.680
<v Speaker 1>It's mind over matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to show that in all the</v>

180
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:30.540
<v Speaker 1>challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adaptive power of ours is enormous,</v>

181
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:35.100
<v Speaker 1>but as we are not stimulating or using</v>
<v Speaker 1>that anymore,</v>

182
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:41.090
<v Speaker 1>you get a neglected body and become sick</v>
<v Speaker 1>or half in its potency.</v>

183
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.410
<v Speaker 1>And so very logic.</v>

184
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:48.780
<v Speaker 2>So the powers that our body has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the untapped power that we probably had</v>

185
00:08:49.631 --> 00:08:51.760
<v Speaker 2>for millennia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with the cold,</v>

186
00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:53.500
<v Speaker 2>dealing with the heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with adversity,</v>

187
00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:56.700
<v Speaker 2>dealing with struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those powers are not being tapped</v>

188
00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:57.840
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because of that,</v>

189
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:01.020
<v Speaker 2>the body just atrophies and we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't know what to do with</v>

190
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
