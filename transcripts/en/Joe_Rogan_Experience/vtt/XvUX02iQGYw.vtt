00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want queefs.</v>

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't break for queefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't like,</v>

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.650
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking going and you hear that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they sort of want to stop fucking</v>

4
00:00:09.651 --> 00:00:11.500
<v Speaker 1>right for it to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like I'm driving on the highway</v>

5
00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:12.334
<v Speaker 1>and someone goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

6
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.390
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this.</v>

7
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you eat pussy when they're on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>period?</v>

8
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

9
00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:18.340
<v Speaker 1>but as I got older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

10
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

11
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.380
<v Speaker 1>I used to fuck chicks with Shane a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how dare you?</v>

12
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.260
<v Speaker 1>We would accidentally touch dicks</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

13
00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Like one time I was just like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>operation game.</v>

14
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.570
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was fucking a girl in her</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass and it went into her cunt and</v>

15
00:00:31.571 --> 00:00:36.280
<v Speaker 1>actually went into his condom inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking down at her how looses his</v>

16
00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:36.881
<v Speaker 1>cotton?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

17
00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:39.490
<v Speaker 1>A fucking trash bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was harder than making sense.</v>

18
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>At least resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm looking down at it,</v>

19
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.110
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God I'm got inside his</v>

20
00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:45.080
<v Speaker 1>condom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

21
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.160
<v Speaker 1>So using the condom ever believes me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this container so that you guys</v>

22
00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>could rub dicks together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that wasn't the plan.</v>

23
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.330
<v Speaker 1>But I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

24
00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking this bitch his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I looked down and I see an asshole</v>

25
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.120
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many assholes does this woman that</v>

26
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least one of them.</v>

27
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 1>And then I reached down and I feel a</v>
<v Speaker 1>condom.</v>

28
00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:04.870
<v Speaker 1>How drunk were you guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Drunk at all.</v>

29
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Why did you not know where you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting your Dick?</v>

30
00:01:07.031 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Don't you look?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you looking at?</v>

31
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking,</v>

32
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.590
<v Speaker 1>you're on the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're pushing and pushing and pushing</v>

33
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.120
<v Speaker 1>and then you sort of feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it slipped.</v>

34
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go,</v>

35
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that must have gone in the hole.</v>

36
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>The one that was pushing again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl doing the whole time.</v>

37
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Calling</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Donald Sutherland in invasion of</v>

38
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>the body snatchers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Well she's got to Dixon in Vaginas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking,</v>

40
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huster listen,</v>

41
00:01:29.651 --> 00:01:31.810
<v Speaker 1>she was from Malta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to wrap this up on a,</v>

42
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.540
<v Speaker 1>on a high note like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're out of time story.</v>

43
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.241
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

44
00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've reached down,</v>

45
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a condom on,</v>

46
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.400
<v Speaker 1>I have a condom on and then I pulled out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I busted not on her butt.</v>

47
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people go,</v>

48
00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:47.050
<v Speaker 1>but you touched a dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're doing that kind of</v>

49
00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:49.450
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like two mobsters digging a hole</v>

50
00:01:49.451 --> 00:01:52.510
<v Speaker 1>for a body and their shovels clink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't fucking know</v>

51
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 2>where you're at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

52
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.953
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

53
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 2>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want him to get you wrap that up nice</v>

54
00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 2>and tight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know I had a revelation the other</v>

55
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 2>day when it came to movies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

56
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 2>I went to see the Martian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty good.</v>

57
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is,</v>

58
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that movie is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know he's going to live,</v>

59
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna make it so it's like someone</v>

60
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 2>gave you a spoiler alert before you even</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to the movie.</v>

61
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.441
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

62
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 2>is he going to die on Mars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I paying money to watch two hours of</v>

63
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 2>him and he's going to die on Mars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck out of here.</v>

64
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows he's not going to die on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mars.</v>

65
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.540
<v Speaker 2>But the revelation was there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's too many movies and like even</v>

66
00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:34.530
<v Speaker 2>really awesome movies like sicario</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be pretty bad ass.</v>

67
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.190
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the new Benicio Del Toro movie.</v>

68
00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be pretty bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we couldn't get a ticket to that</v>

69
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:41.300
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

70
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.020
<v Speaker 2>in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

71
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.060
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were sold out so we went with the</v>

72
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Martian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

73
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 2>but the point is these movies never</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

74
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 2>Every week there's new ones and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't go away.</v>

75
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Like the old ones don't stop being</v>
<v Speaker 2>around like you can go watch them too.</v>

76
00:02:56.971 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's too many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was thinking about all the</v>

77
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 2>different movies just on itunes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Netflix and I was scrolling through them</v>

78
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.780
<v Speaker 2>and I started thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

79
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 2>this is a neverending equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it just keeps getting tacked onto</v>

80
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in the epicenter of where it's</v>

81
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:15.660
<v Speaker 2>created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all around here and it's,</v>

82
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange because the body of</v>
<v Speaker 2>work just never stops.</v>

83
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Like he used to be when I was a kid.</v>

84
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 2>When a good movie came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would go to see that fucking movie.</v>

85
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.270
<v Speaker 2>Like Star Wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw star wars 13 times and I was in</v>

86
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 2>nothing compared to the real geeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>

87
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 2>there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a big deal back then to see how</v>

88
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:41.080
<v Speaker 2>many times you could see a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you couldn't run a movie long</v>

89
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 2>enough to see for someone to see it 13</v>
<v Speaker 2>times now because there's new ones,</v>

90
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 2>there's new ones come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to get this fucking piece of shit</v>

91
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 2>out of the theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would never have a movie like star</v>

92
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 2>wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It played over and over and over and</v>

93
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if star wars came out today,</v>

94
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 2>people would shit right in its mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

95
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is to me in my childhood,</v>

96
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest movies of all time</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid and that movie came</v>

97
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when Obi wan Kenobi was</v>

98
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:12.810
<v Speaker 2>talking to Luke Skywalker and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

99
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 2>they were in the sand.</v>

100
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the greatest thing I've ever</v>

101
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 2>seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is amazing.</v>

102
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 2>This guy's in space and he's got an Obi</v>
<v Speaker 2>wan Kenobi is going to teach them how to</v>

103
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:24.210
<v Speaker 2>be a jet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

104
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the greatest movie ever.</v>

105
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 2>I remember it couldn't have been more</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

106
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 2>I remember seeing that movie and</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

107
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:33.820
<v Speaker 2>this movie is fucking perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you go watch and you're like,</v>

108
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a clunky Turd.</v>

109
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 2>It's clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The special effects look like shit.</v>

110
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Why is Darth vader evil?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he,</v>

111
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does not even a reason why he's evil.</v>

112
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 2>He's just evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does he get when he takes over the</v>

113
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 2>world is even get pussy is even going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get any pussy in space.</v>

114
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 2>He know he's just building some giant</v>
<v Speaker 2>star that can blow up planets.</v>

115
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so dumb.</v>

116
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Like it's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

117
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 2>uses the dark side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

118
00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 2>not the dark side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucking dumb.</v>

119
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.730
<v Speaker 1>And it's puppets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like kermit the frog and the</v>

120
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:07.080
<v Speaker 1>skywalker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's day like if you judge it in the</v>

121
00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:10.260
<v Speaker 1>context of its day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the all time classic films.</v>

122
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.560
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many more now and they're</v>

123
00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:16.020
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say you are a fighter.</v>

124
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Power example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to opponent,</v>

125
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.040
<v Speaker 1>but this time the opponent is yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

126
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.310
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

127
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.680
<v Speaker 1>and you know it from the inside and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel it from the inside and it makes you</v>

128
00:05:28.681 --> 00:05:30.300
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you strong and makes you</v>

129
00:05:30.301 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what we have lost from the</v>

130
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.980
<v Speaker 1>nature and now it's back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

131
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.610
<v Speaker 1>so in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you've done is you tapped into</v>

132
00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:45.480
<v Speaker 1>something extremely primal by dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with one of the most primal elements of</v>

133
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:46.710
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is cold.</v>

134
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the cold,</v>

135
00:05:48.201 --> 00:05:49.220
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

136
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.220
<v Speaker 1>in the vice documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was really fascinating.</v>

137
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.010
<v Speaker 1>You said cold is your God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes it is.</v>

138
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had a teach,</v>

139
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

140
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

141
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Goudreau or mentor or Sifu or anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

142
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 2>The cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my teacher.</v>

143
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 2>That's my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been dodging the colts and tells a</v>

144
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 2>little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

145
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 2>You just felt compelled to jump into</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

146
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

147
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 2>And what was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were saying this to people,</v>

148
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 2>when you're 31 years old and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling people I can control my immune</v>

149
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:26.331
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

150
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 2>they must've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out of your fucking mind.</v>

151
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Look at this guys jumping in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>freezing water and he says he can</v>

152
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 2>control his immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you convince people to the point</v>

153
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.680
<v Speaker 2>that you got actual scientists to</v>
<v Speaker 2>measure your blood?</v>

154
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Do legitimate scientific studies on you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what was it your accomplishments</v>

155
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 2>like you went for people that don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

156
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 2>you did a bunch of really unbelievable</v>
<v Speaker 2>tasks.</v>

157
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you climbed everest in your shorts.</v>

158
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you have shoes on when you climbed</v>

159
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 2>everest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

160
00:06:57.321 --> 00:06:59.240
<v Speaker 2>I had to with spikes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spikes,</v>

161
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.420
<v Speaker 2>climbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slippery,</v>

162
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.533
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

163
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Add a random Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No showed on that.</v>

164
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>I think I go buy clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane because it's like you are</v>

165
00:07:13.501 --> 00:07:14.520
<v Speaker 1>not challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

166
00:07:14.521 --> 00:07:18.480
<v Speaker 1>nature you can go up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their car as well.</v>

167
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.360
<v Speaker 1>And then you go up Everest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

168
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Anything artificial you use in nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make you having the right</v>

169
00:07:27.511 --> 00:07:31.620
<v Speaker 1>connection with nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I wanted to challenge in all</v>

170
00:07:31.621 --> 00:07:35.250
<v Speaker 1>the challenges I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like marathons beyond the polar circle</v>

171
00:07:35.251 --> 00:07:38.940
<v Speaker 1>in midwinter and short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also in the heat of the desert</v>

172
00:07:38.941 --> 00:07:43.120
<v Speaker 1>without drinking or hanging by one</v>
<v Speaker 1>finger on,</v>

173
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.470
<v Speaker 1>I want to half Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a mile and up in the air.</v>

174
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.040
<v Speaker 1>What it in winter time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hung up by one finger.</v>

175
00:07:50.041 --> 00:07:51.510
<v Speaker 1>A mile up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

176
00:07:51.511 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where was this alternate Holland's her</v>

177
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:58.020
<v Speaker 1>between two hot air balloons and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>climbing between them.</v>

178
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.030
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.900
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing,</v>

180
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a device I could kind of put it on with</v>

181
00:08:03.361 --> 00:08:04.280
<v Speaker 1>one finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

182
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.020
<v Speaker 1>How long has your hanger for a 25</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

183
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Five seconds with one finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in winter time,</v>

184
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.130
<v Speaker 1>winter time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:08:14.131 --> 00:08:19.131
<v Speaker 1>you lose control when the blood becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold or in the hands you lose control.</v>

186
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.710
<v Speaker 1>So that was the challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mind over matter.</v>

187
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.490
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to show that in all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges,</v>

188
00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 1>the adaptive power of ours is enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as we are not stimulating or using</v>

189
00:08:34.351 --> 00:08:38.730
<v Speaker 1>that anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a neglected body and become sick</v>

190
00:08:38.731 --> 00:08:43.410
<v Speaker 1>or half in its potency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so very logic.</v>

191
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.170
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the powers that our body has,</v>

192
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.760
<v Speaker 2>the untapped power is that we probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>had for millennia dealing with the cold,</v>

193
00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:53.470
<v Speaker 2>dealing with the heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with adversity,</v>

194
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:56.700
<v Speaker 2>dealing with struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those powers are not being tapped</v>

195
00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:57.840
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because of that,</v>

196
00:08:57.841 --> 00:08:59.760
<v Speaker 2>the body just atrophies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we don't,</v>

197
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.440
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't know what to do like</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

198
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.363
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

199
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
