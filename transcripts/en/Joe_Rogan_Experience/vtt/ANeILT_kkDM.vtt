<v Speaker 1>she answered herself up.</v>

11
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.460

17
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.110

<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

18
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:37.830
<v Speaker 1>And she's crazy answering or so what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on with her voice?</v>

19
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Because she didn't have that voice when </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was bruce.</v>

20
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a different voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>

21
00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was pretty similar.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like her face is numb over in wash.</v>

24
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>I thought she was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched you.</v>

25
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Did you see her show?</v>

<v Speaker 1>She had like a reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which bob mean how much of a boring </v>

27
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:10.491
<v Speaker 1>person you have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I think how interesting is like an </v>

00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 1>ex Olympic athlete turns into a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're still boring still.</v>

29
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:17.631
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to see that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She needed a better producer.</v>

30
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Seems like I put her in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting situations is boring.</v>

31
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Like I watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to watch it.</v>

32
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>It was boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

33
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like they've missed a </v>

34
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.520
<v Speaker 1>formula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

35
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.260
<v Speaker 1>that is a fascinating situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until they're 60 years old and then </v>

36
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>becomes a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:38.670

<v Speaker 1>How could it?</v>

38
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I think what happened was she wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>open about what her transition.</v>

39
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:44.630
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>she didn't really talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.540

42
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>that's when I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on her side and they're like,</v>

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

<v Speaker 1>gay marriage has grown.</v>

74
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.400

80
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.691
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to hurt anyone's </v>

<v Speaker 1>Girlfriend used to be a board.</v>

88
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what she used to look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Christ.</v>

89
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 1>The world is so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she's like,</v>

90
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not a great person.</v>

91
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean she killed that lady with her car</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then said nothing like that was the </v>

92
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the footage?</v>

93
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

94
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>it's looks completely her fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She bumped into this lady who was </v>

95
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>stopped and the lady went across traffic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and died.</v>

96
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no one talked about it like I was </v>

97
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.750
<v Speaker 1>putting on my land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calm in the mirror.</v>

98
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Didn't share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what she said?</v>

99
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 1>But she was looking at her phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see this.</v>

100
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.960

<v Speaker 1>no one gives a fuck.</v>

102
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Because the story is not that.</v>

104
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.930

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:43.390
<v Speaker 1>people like ignored that and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>went well.</v>

<v Speaker 2>door.</v>

162
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.180
<v Speaker 1>A grown man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

163
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.450
<v Speaker 1>You're an actual full grown man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an old grown man.</v>

164
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy.</v>

165
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.030
<v Speaker 1>So you really just decided to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing these full time.</v>

166
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>It just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even like a brave decision or </v>

167
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really couldn't sleep.</v>

168
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.861
<v Speaker 1>I was having panic attacks that I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I saw my future and it was like </v>

169
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be a writer writing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people for the rest of my life.</v>

170
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.460
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get addicted to the money and the </v>

171
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:33.460
<v Speaker 1>insurance and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it happens to so many comments.</v>

172
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.420
<v Speaker 1>It happens like I and I heard about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't see it coming and it just.</v>

173
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.610
<v Speaker 1>I suddenly woke up last summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

174
00:08:38.611 --> 00:08:43.611
<v Speaker 1>I have to stop or I'll do this forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a few friends of mine who are </v>

175
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:48.221
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really funny comics and then can't work </v>

176
00:08:48.221 --> 00:08:52.100
<v Speaker 1>because they spent so many years doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitcoms as a writer or doing sketch </v>

177
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.140
<v Speaker 1>shows as a writer that they don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>following,</v>

178
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 1>a following in the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're world class comedians.</v>

179
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you know Owen Smith?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

180
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows who he is.</v>

181
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

182
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:07.470
<v Speaker 1>you're one of the 20 best comics in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

183
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.750
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any nice guy.</v>

184
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Great Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian Edwards.</v>

185
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Same Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean more people known to Ian now than</v>

186
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:16.760
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God says,</v>

187
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.650
<v Speaker 1>trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking trap.</v>

188
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Only so much creative energy and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're giving it to someone else,</v>

189
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:25.230
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that you're tired all day,</v>

190
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 1>you're stuck in an office and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go on the road.</v>

191
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want to be a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do sets multiple times a </v>

192
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.140
<v Speaker 1>week and you've got to go on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the way it is.</v>

193
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.390
<v Speaker 1>There's no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other way to do it.</v>

194
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.640
<v Speaker 1>If you get in your fifties and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not famous,</v>

195
00:09:39.641 --> 00:09:40.960
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a decent following.</v>

196
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked,</v>

197
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.200
<v Speaker 1>you're screwed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked,</v>

198
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.340
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked and lets you run white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Ron White got famous.</v>

199
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:51.450
<v Speaker 1>His late forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was living in Mexico in his forties.</v>

200
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Done.</v>

201
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:58.130
<v Speaker 1>And then Jeff foxworthy contacted them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they started doing that blue collar </v>

202
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.661
<v Speaker 1>comedy tour and boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's got a private jet balling out </v>

<v Speaker 1>of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

204
00:10:02.661 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Big Fat House in Beverly Hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

205

<v Speaker 1>sweet Rodney Dangerfield till.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

208
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:16.350
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then came back,</v>

209
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.720
<v Speaker 1>but the entire time he was away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was writing,</v>

210
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:24.290
<v Speaker 1>which is really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he came back with a fuck load of </v>

211
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.261
<v Speaker 1>material and also came back with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharper style like came back more </v>

213
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

214
00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it changed.</v>

215
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.650
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I can't believe how old I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>

216
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't notice it if anyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>

217
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.660
<v Speaker 1>They're like in their twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get you.</v>

218
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just turned 47.</v>

219
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.760

<v Speaker 1>wise.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

235
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:29.060
<v Speaker 1>like the 19 sixties to the nine to 1971.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 71 was essentially the last </v>

236
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:31.550
<v Speaker 1>good year for cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like Muslim ban.</v>

237
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Me and Joel both ripped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

238
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.070
<v Speaker 1>to share those classic American cars.</v>

239
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.600
<v Speaker 1>There was a few years where they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably cool and then after like 71</v>

240
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:44.670
<v Speaker 1>they fell apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just,</v>

241
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.400
<v Speaker 1>you caught it at the perfect time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

242
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:52.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what I'm known for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being born right at the end of the </v>

243
00:11:52.401 --> 00:11:53.280
<v Speaker 1>muscle cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy one barracuda.</v>

244
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.690
<v Speaker 1>That was probably the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big car guy.</v>

245
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.050
<v Speaker 1>I love cars.</v>

246
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.850

247
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:02.590
<v Speaker 1>what I could afford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I had a Honda civic wants to.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Every time you put that in,</v>

253
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.870
<v Speaker 1>there's no confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problems,</v>

254
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:15.640
<v Speaker 1>no worries.</v>

<v Speaker 1>expensive.</v>

268
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what's going on with Tesla </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the formula employee,</v>

269
00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:46.741
<v Speaker 1>some employee was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was sabotaging code and a leaky </v>

270
00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:49.060
<v Speaker 1>information and now the employee is </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

<v Speaker 1>employee because he owed money.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

319
00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:50.590
<v Speaker 1>I um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten quicker at them but it still</v>

320
00:14:50.591 --> 00:14:50.980
<v Speaker 1>takes</v>

321
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inordinate amount of time probably </v>

322
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:56.270
<v Speaker 4>because there's like I get the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nick,</v>

323
00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:01.350
<v Speaker 4>I'll write something quick and then I'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep on it and then I'll go work on a </v>

324
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.741
<v Speaker 4>little more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Try to edit it down because you want to </v>

325
00:15:04.741 --> 00:15:07.151
<v Speaker 4>make it like pretty tight with like </v>
<v Speaker 4>online people don't want a minute of </v>

326
00:15:07.151 --> 00:15:09.120
<v Speaker 4>fluff or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you got to go quick.</v>

327
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the actual process of,</v>

328
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.590
<v Speaker 4>of getting them to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll take the person who talks the most,</v>

329
00:15:13.591 --> 00:15:18.591
<v Speaker 4>like if it's Caitlin and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll film that and I'll have the whole </v>

330
00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:22.050
<v Speaker 4>script written out so as I feel it in my</v>
<v Speaker 4>mouth all talk the other words.</v>

331
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:27.080
<v Speaker 4>So the timing is kind of close to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I'll send that video to myself </v>

332
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.791
<v Speaker 4>to my airdrop it to my laptop and turn </v>
<v Speaker 4>it really low and then I'll do the next </v>

333
00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:35.190
<v Speaker 4>character and have that playing so I can</v>
<v Speaker 4>have that sinked up.</v>

334
00:15:35.191 --> 00:15:40.191
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I compare those to do the next </v>

335
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:40.191
<v Speaker 4>person like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

336
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:41.280
<v Speaker 4>Get a lot of time on my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

337
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.130
<v Speaker 4>But I'm only 47.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

338
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.960
<v Speaker 5>So what was the thought process when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>quit?</v>

339
00:15:45.961 --> 00:15:48.020
<v Speaker 5>You just couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You had to,</v>

340
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.830
<v Speaker 5>you had to get out.</v>

341
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

342
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.880
<v Speaker 4>I just um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something was the,</v>

343
00:15:52.881 --> 00:15:56.750
<v Speaker 4>like a panicking it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was I think seeing my life and I,</v>

344
00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.900
<v Speaker 4>I want to at least try to be like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>performers.</v>

345
00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.080

<v Speaker 4>What I wanted to do,</v>

346
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:06.150

<v Speaker 4>And being a writer to me is um,</v>

347
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.460
<v Speaker 4>it's not as fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

348
00:16:08.461 --> 00:16:10.870
<v Speaker 4>if I didn't have the experience before </v>
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>

349
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.430
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

350
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:15.260
<v Speaker 4>it's just I got a taste,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

351
00:16:15.261 --> 00:16:20.261
<v Speaker 4>I had some stuff that I did that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>really enjoyed it just,</v>

352
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.220
<v Speaker 4>I think I just saw the,</v>

353
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.300
<v Speaker 5>the trappings of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

354
00:16:24.301 --> 00:16:26.370
<v Speaker 5>some people are really good writers in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

355
00:16:26.371 --> 00:16:28.950
<v Speaker 5>that's what they want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's all they want to do.</v>

356
00:16:28.951 --> 00:16:33.951
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to perform.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the problem with being a good </v>

357
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:33.951
<v Speaker 5>performer is sometimes you can help </v>
<v Speaker 5>other people out.</v>

358
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:34.410
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

359
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:39.470
<v Speaker 5>if you just tighten this up here and </v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe if you just explain this a little </v>

360
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.240
<v Speaker 5>better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would work better and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you're got a corkboard and you're </v>

366
00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:50.730
<v Speaker 5>putting index cards up and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm really thankful for those jobs.</v>

371
00:16:56.711 --> 00:16:59.660
<v Speaker 4>And they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were really great and I,</v>

372
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a house and stuff,</v>

373
00:17:01.391 --> 00:17:03.190
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

374
00:17:03.191 --> 00:17:07.280
<v Speaker 4>this is like last power drive I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>

375
00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:12.250
<v Speaker 4>If this doesn't work out with Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean just this though,</v>

376
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm really excited because now I can do </v>
<v Speaker 4>little theaters.</v>

377
00:17:14.831 --> 00:17:19.831
<v Speaker 4>Like the draw directly from instagram </v>
<v Speaker 4>has enabled me to like get out of clubs </v>

378
00:17:21.251 --> 00:17:23.950
<v Speaker 4>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it worked and I feel the audience,</v>

379
00:17:23.951 --> 00:17:27.990
<v Speaker 4>like I just had chosen San Francisco and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such a difference when the audience</v>

380
00:17:27.991 --> 00:17:32.991
<v Speaker 4>knows what you do and who you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of like having to take them </v>

381
00:17:32.991 --> 00:17:33.070
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>

382
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:38.030
<v Speaker 5>Well you might be one of the only guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's done it that way though,</v>

383
00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:41.150
<v Speaker 5>through characters in little short one </v>
<v Speaker 5>minute videos.</v>

384
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:42.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I really,</v>

385
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.840
<v Speaker 4>I started off with that but then there </v>
<v Speaker 4>was no money in sketch really,</v>

386
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:48.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I got into standup,</v>

387
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 4>I needed to make</v>

388
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.330
<v Speaker 1>money and so I never felt standup was </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I did the best.</v>

389
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:59.331
<v Speaker 1>But now I feel like I'm getting a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>better at stand up and I'm actually </v>

390
00:17:59.331 --> 00:18:02.571
<v Speaker 1>enjoying it more now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it characters and impressions is </v>

391
00:18:02.571 --> 00:18:03.750
<v Speaker 1>when you do shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever play videos?</v>

392
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you play that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did a show?</v>

393
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:10.401
<v Speaker 1>I have a show at Largo that I do like </v>
<v Speaker 1>every couple months and I did show </v>

394
00:18:10.401 --> 00:18:11.040
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the owner's idea.</v>

395
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was really fun.</v>

396
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

397
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you make some videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific to the show.</v>

398
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.400
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do that,</v>

399
00:18:23.401 --> 00:18:24.400
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but watching,</v>

400
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.860
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I should do.</v>

401
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Like have trumpy like next step guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethic or whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's a good one.</v>

531
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.530
<v Speaker 4>But it's a lot of words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A of letters.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'll take it,</v>

587
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:11.290
<v Speaker 5>I'll take it and I'm going to run with </v>
<v Speaker 5>it and it'll open up a whole new realm </v>

588
00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:11.290
<v Speaker 5>of material.</v>

589
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:17.680
<v Speaker 5>Just bring your 23 and me and it's going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to start shitting on white people.</v>

590
00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.770
<v Speaker 5>So hard to be a white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the hardest thing to be.</v>

591
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:23.810
<v Speaker 5>So polite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

592
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.120
<v Speaker 5>She had no one to blame.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So always.</v>

593
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.200
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's your fault,</v>

594
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.140
<v Speaker 5>but it's also the easiest thing to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>

595
00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:31.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm just kidding.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could talk for hours about the </v>

619
00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:29.500
<v Speaker 4>disappointments,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I wish I could remember.</v>

626
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.920
<v Speaker 4>It might've been Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom,</v>

627
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.620
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom Was Tom.</v>

628
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.660
<v Speaker 4>He was pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a comic.</v>

629
00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:53.880
<v Speaker 4>Pretty sure it was a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might've been Tom.</v>

630
00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:56.240
<v Speaker 4>He was the first one to host one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mine.</v>

631
00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.610
<v Speaker 4>Think maybe that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did this show.</v>

632
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:00.330
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

633
00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:05.340
<v Speaker 4>I won't go into it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's just say I have so many </v>

634
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:05.340
<v Speaker 4>disasters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't write thought.</v>

635
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.900
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get ready for the rocket ship Kyle,</v>

636
00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:13.440
<v Speaker 4>go the shopping because things were </v>
<v Speaker 4>about to take off and just always </v>

637
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.380
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did this Jamie Fox,</v>

638
00:28:16.381 --> 00:28:21.381
<v Speaker 4>like a sketch show pilot and it took to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get up a part on a network show.</v>

639
00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:29.420
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of auditions if you climb a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain to get the role and I was like,</v>

640
00:28:30.661 --> 00:28:35.661
<v Speaker 4>feeling this is my last shot and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything and I got there and we </v>

641
00:28:35.661 --> 00:28:35.661
<v Speaker 4>couldn't.</v>

642
00:28:35.661 --> 00:28:36.510
<v Speaker 4>We weren't allowed to write for </v>
<v Speaker 4>ourselves.</v>

643
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.730
<v Speaker 4>Blood is a wga rolls or something and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

644
00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:41.520
<v Speaker 4>you have a character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one else can really write for it.</v>

645
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:47.300
<v Speaker 4>And the people that were writing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two of them just got out of prison and </v>

646
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.220
<v Speaker 4>they were not comedy writers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie is a huge career.</v>

647
00:28:50.221 --> 00:28:52.320
<v Speaker 4>He didn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just was like,</v>

648
00:28:52.321 --> 00:28:57.321
<v Speaker 4>let me get my friends this because I got</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this other stuff going on and he </v>

649
00:28:57.321 --> 00:28:57.321
<v Speaker 4>didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need it now.</v>

650
00:28:57.321 --> 00:28:58.850
<v Speaker 4>He would show up like once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

651
00:28:58.860 --> 00:28:59.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

652
00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's busy.</v>

653
00:29:01.021 --> 00:29:06.021
<v Speaker 4>I need to come in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He come in with glasses like Shay and </v>

654
00:29:06.021 --> 00:29:09.341
<v Speaker 4>we'd go and we'd read the script and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there'd be no ending or seemingly point </v>

655
00:29:09.341 --> 00:29:11.310
<v Speaker 4>and then one time he threw the script </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there was like,</v>

656
00:29:11.311 --> 00:29:12.720
<v Speaker 4>fuck that script.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

658
00:29:13.771 --> 00:29:15.210

<v Speaker 4>were like,</v>

659
00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:16.030
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't do.</v>

660
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:18.840
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was like,</v>

661
00:29:18.841 --> 00:29:21.060

<v Speaker 4>there's an Arby's at the top,</v>

662
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.910
<v Speaker 4>just like the thing that was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

663
00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:26.850
<v Speaker 4>These writers called me into their </v>
<v Speaker 4>office once and they were like,</v>

00:37:27.691 --> 00:37:29.100
<v Speaker 1>that a rumor or do we not know this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

819
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's supposed to be real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think it's supposed to be fake.</v>

820
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:32.910
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds fake.</v>

821
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.760
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like something someone would </v>
<v Speaker 1>just make up,</v>

822
00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.400
<v Speaker 1>like not even well planned out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

823
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:43.460
<v Speaker 1>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What percentage of people like to be </v>

824
00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:43.460
<v Speaker 1>peed on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be below one percent.</v>

825
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.140
<v Speaker 1>That's still a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 300 million people.</v>

826
00:37:46.141 --> 00:37:51.141
<v Speaker 1>That means 3 million people or to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>peed on just in this country alone.</v>

827
00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:56.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of cleanup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think it's one perCent,</v>

828
00:37:56.221 --> 00:37:58.710
<v Speaker 1>but even if it's one 10th of one percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>is 300,000</v>

829
00:37:58.711 --> 00:37:59.610
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

830
00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:04.611
<v Speaker 1>I love a chocolate sundae,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you smeared it all over the </v>

831
00:38:04.611 --> 00:38:08.271
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then after I had to clean up I'd </v>

832
00:38:08.271 --> 00:38:08.271
<v Speaker 1>probably back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

833
00:38:08.271 --> 00:38:11.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a freakish thing you're </v>

834
00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.500
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprisingly team.</v>

835
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in anything freaky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never even done like whipped cream </v>

836
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.071
<v Speaker 1>or anything hot about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a gIrl asks you to choke her a </v>

837
00:38:22.071 --> 00:38:22.830
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel about that?</v>

838
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a scary.</v>

839
00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:28.080
<v Speaker 1>It requests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into that.</v>

840
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

841
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.730
<v Speaker 1>I had a girl that I used to date who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted me to rape her.</v>

842
00:38:32.731 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 1>She told me the raper that's hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>

843
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.910
<v Speaker 4>tough and problem with she was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>hot and I was like,</v>

844
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.060
<v Speaker 4>I do not want to get interested in doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

845
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:47.590
<v Speaker 4>Like the worst thing would be you really</v>
<v Speaker 4>liked that because I was in my twenties.</v>

846
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:52.650
<v Speaker 4>What if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if I just had it came after I got </v>

847
00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:54.580
<v Speaker 4>into like only girls that want you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like force them to do shit.</v>

848
00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.650
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's very true.</v>

849
00:38:56.651 --> 00:38:59.230
<v Speaker 4>When you are young and you're forming </v>
<v Speaker 4>your sexuality,</v>

850
00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.030
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you first got your.</v>

851
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:05.920
<v Speaker 4>Like when I first dance with a girl and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I noticed her hips were wide,</v>

852
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:11.300
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got like a boner and there's like an </v>

853
00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.531
<v Speaker 4>eighth grade because it was like this is</v>
<v Speaker 4>different and it linked and four years </v>

854
00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:20.130
<v Speaker 4>till I was in my early thirties I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>not dance with a girl without getting a </v>

855
00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.750
<v Speaker 4>hard on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was at a wedding once and I asked this</v>

856
00:39:22.751 --> 00:39:27.751
<v Speaker 4>girl to death like I never do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she was alone and she was hot and I </v>

857
00:39:27.751 --> 00:39:31.821
<v Speaker 4>get on the dance sport,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my mother's there and I got like a </v>

858
00:39:31.821 --> 00:39:34.891
<v Speaker 4>boner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know this girl at all and I had </v>

859
00:39:34.891 --> 00:39:35.050
<v Speaker 4>to tell her because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

860
00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your wedding pants are,</v>

861
00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.700
<v Speaker 4>are not keeping things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

862
00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.810
<v Speaker 4>and so full pitched and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she probably already knew.</v>

863
00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:45.160
<v Speaker 4>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

864
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.180
<v Speaker 4>can you help me up off the floor?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had to,</v>

865
00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:53.310
<v Speaker 4>how humiliating says I'd asked this girl</v>
<v Speaker 4>to like shimmer me off the floor away </v>

866
00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.180
<v Speaker 4>from my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

867
00:39:55.181 --> 00:39:57.730
<v Speaker 4>she had a good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>luckily a good sense of humor about it,</v>

868
00:39:57.731 --> 00:40:00.330
<v Speaker 4>but it's not like she.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

869
00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:02.590
<v Speaker 4>well I shouldn't say she should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>flattered,</v>

870
00:40:02.591 --> 00:40:04.660
<v Speaker 4>but a grownup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What sense of humor?</v>

871
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:09.920
<v Speaker 4>Be flattered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She invited her halloween party after </v>

872
00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:09.920
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a good sign,</v>

873
00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.700
<v Speaker 4>but that went bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got All dressed up as the universe.</v>

874
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:15.140
<v Speaker 4>Like I started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

875
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:20.170
<v Speaker 4>I had like a whole black outfit and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>glued like planets to my body with </v>

876
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:20.170
<v Speaker 4>velcro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

877
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:24.310
<v Speaker 4>a grown man and then I go to her house </v>
<v Speaker 4>on time,</v>

878
00:40:24.311 --> 00:40:26.770
<v Speaker 4>which I didn't realize you don't go to </v>
<v Speaker 4>parties on time.</v>

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.770
<v Speaker 4>I just gotten to la and then I went and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to hug her.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I knocked over the skeleton on the wall </v>
<v Speaker 4>and their dog ran up and like bit venus </v>

<v Speaker 4>in the room and no one's dressed up.</v>

882
00:40:39.701 --> 00:40:41.730
<v Speaker 4>People are coming and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have abandoned any.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but no one's really dressed up except </v>

884
00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.321
<v Speaker 4>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was a pariah and then no one </v>

00:40:49.321 --> 00:40:49.330
<v Speaker 4>taught me how to put the at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy,</v>

886
00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.370

899
00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:19.620
<v Speaker 4>jockey and they were drunk and I think I</v>
<v Speaker 4>seem like a target because I had the </v>

<v Speaker 4>universe on my body seemed like an easy </v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>

902
00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:28.410
<v Speaker 4>that's a severe weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless you were doing something.</v>

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:31.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean they.</v>

911
00:41:43.761 --> 00:41:48.761

<v Speaker 1>she was into like rubbing her feet on me</v>

<v Speaker 1>and put her feet on my girlfriend.</v>

917
00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

918
00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I used to go to this math class,</v>

<v Speaker 1>getting connected to like an a </v>

923
00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:32.540
<v Speaker 1>particular thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whether it's choking someone or any</v>

926
00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Also would grab my hand and put it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back or get me to force her head </v>

927
00:42:40.191 --> 00:42:42.260

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

929
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:49.810

<v Speaker 1>It's almost like when we first started </v>

930
00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:49.810
<v Speaker 1>fooling around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>don't tell them this motherfucker what I</v>

932
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:55.520
<v Speaker 1>like normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then one day she wanted to russell.</v>

933
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

934
00:42:57.771 --> 00:43:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Just like a gateway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drugs like what?</v>

935
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:01.130
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to wrestle you.</v>

936
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:02.960
<v Speaker 1>I'll kick your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

937
00:43:02.961 --> 00:43:04.850
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you doing?</v>

938
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Theater up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lost.</v>

939
00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.940
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

940
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I didn't beat her up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was trying to figure out what </v>

941
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:16.130
<v Speaker 1>we're doing while we're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she turned in sexual.</v>

942
00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.780
<v Speaker 1>She got into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

943
00:43:17.781 --> 00:43:19.490
<v Speaker 1>I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like louis ck.</v>

944
00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.930
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember his show,</v>

945
00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:23.690
<v Speaker 1>like one of the first episodes he had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>show wrote,</v>

946
00:43:23.691 --> 00:43:28.010
<v Speaker 1>got older girl asked him to jerk off in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of her and I was always like,</v>

947
00:43:28.011 --> 00:43:33.011
<v Speaker 1>I bet that actually happened and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>got linked up and you can't really </v>

948
00:43:33.011 --> 00:43:36.170
<v Speaker 1>decide what links up your sexuality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that turns you on.</v>

949
00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:39.050
<v Speaker 1>It just could have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no information,</v>

950
00:43:39.051 --> 00:43:42.710
<v Speaker 1>but that's my guess if people are into </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird shit man,</v>

951
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:45.020
<v Speaker 1>during the weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the weirdest is.</v>

952
00:43:45.021 --> 00:43:48.350
<v Speaker 1>This is this smelling the shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

953
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:55.210
<v Speaker 1>marla maples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's x put a camera in her bedroom </v>

954
00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:55.730
<v Speaker 1>because she kept in her closet because </v>
<v Speaker 1>she kept.</v>

955
00:43:55.940 --> 00:44:00.940
<v Speaker 1>She didn't have one shoe and it was some</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend would come in the economy just </v>

956
00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:04.070
<v Speaker 1>like just coming in and stealing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sniffing ashish christ.</v>

957
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Zakat linked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

958
00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:07.970
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

959
00:44:07.971 --> 00:44:09.230
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

960
00:44:09.231 --> 00:44:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Like stealing underwear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing shoes.</v>

961
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Men is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men get picked on because we're pervs </v>

962
00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:18.680
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's true.</v>

963
00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.720
<v Speaker 1>But if we weren't pervs this species </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be.</v>

964
00:44:20.721 --> 00:44:22.940
<v Speaker 1>Or let me tell you why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we were down to like 70,000</v>

965
00:44:22.941 --> 00:44:27.230
<v Speaker 1>people if we didn't have this super per </v>
<v Speaker 1>game to go through the snow,</v>

966
00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.320
<v Speaker 1>get some pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's less than 70,000</v>

967
00:44:30.321 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were saying that after</v>

968
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:36.080
<v Speaker 5>one of the super volcanoes it might've </v>
<v Speaker 5>gotten down to is just a few thousand.</v>

969
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:37.310
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

970
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:41.180
<v Speaker 5>there was a definite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does it sumatra?</v>

971
00:44:41.181 --> 00:44:42.710
<v Speaker 5>Is that where it was?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Indonesia.</v>

972
00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:46.220
<v Speaker 5>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some massive super volcano 70,000</v>

973
00:44:46.221 --> 00:44:48.470
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Killed oFf almost everybody.</v>

974
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.030
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know about that.</v>

975
00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:54.860
<v Speaker 5>We got down to extremely low number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they,</v>

976
00:44:54.861 --> 00:44:59.861
<v Speaker 5>they estimate it's somewhere between </v>
<v Speaker 5>like two and maybe like 10,000</v>

977
00:45:01.441 --> 00:45:01.920
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

978
00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:07.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need people who liked to bug a lot </v>

979
00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:07.170
<v Speaker 4>that are real curvy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>curvy.</v>

980
00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:07.170
<v Speaker 4>Jump that up.</v>

981
00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:07.490
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

982
00:45:07.491 --> 00:45:09.170
<v Speaker 5>bret weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who is a.</v>

983
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:11.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was a professor.</v>

984
00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:12.530
<v Speaker 5>The zoo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

985
00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:15.540
<v Speaker 5>what's going on with man?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I smoked weed before the show.</v>

986
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:17.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna lie to you people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

987
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:22.790
<v Speaker 5>he um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was explaining with his wife who's also </v>

988
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:26.120
<v Speaker 5>a biologist that there's two different </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that men are attracted to.</v>

989
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:29.630
<v Speaker 5>They're attracted to a beautiful woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're attracted to a hot woman.</v>

990
00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:32.660
<v Speaker 5>like a hot woman doesn't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to be beautiful,</v>

991
00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:37.460
<v Speaker 5>but what she does is offer an </v>
<v Speaker 5>opportunity for like very quick sex.</v>

992
00:45:37.461 --> 00:45:42.461
<v Speaker 5>Like you could just have sex with her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to court her like a girl </v>

993
00:45:42.461 --> 00:45:46.241
<v Speaker 5>with a short skirt and her tits are </v>
<v Speaker 5>popping out and she's wearing a lot of </v>

994
00:45:46.241 --> 00:45:49.391
<v Speaker 5>makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That what that signals is that there's </v>

995
00:45:49.391 --> 00:45:52.850
<v Speaker 5>an opportunity for you to spread your </v>
<v Speaker 5>genes and you have no responsibility.</v>

996
00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.110
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't have to take care of it.</v>

997
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:56.270
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't have to spend a lot of time</v>

998
00:45:56.271 --> 00:46:00.260
<v Speaker 5>with her court her that she was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's the type of person that allows you</v>

999
00:46:00.261 --> 00:46:05.261
<v Speaker 5>to just fuck her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can move on and spread your genes </v>

1000
00:46:05.261 --> 00:46:05.261
<v Speaker 5>elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense.</v>

1001
00:46:05.261 --> 00:46:06.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That there's like an evolutionary reason</v>

1002
00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.560
<v Speaker 5>for that being a stimulating thing for </v>
<v Speaker 5>men,</v>

1003
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:14.990
<v Speaker 5>for men like this idea of like these </v>
<v Speaker 5>loose women like loose women are very </v>

1004
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:17.490
<v Speaker 5>attracted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very attractive to us for that reason.</v>

1005
00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:19.290
<v Speaker 5>It's not just that like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

1006
00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:20.250
<v Speaker 5>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get some.</v>

1007
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.840
<v Speaker 5>Not deal with all these bitches in </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1008
00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:27.140
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's literally an evolutionary trait </v>

1009
00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:27.140
<v Speaker 5>that we have adapted to</v>

1010
00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:30.260
<v Speaker 4>the disease thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Knocks it back a little bit for me.</v>

1011
00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:34.230
<v Speaker 4>I'll go like a disease there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anecdote,</v>

1012
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.320
<v Speaker 4>anecdote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an antidote for.</v>

1013
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:42.730
<v Speaker 4>Cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel like there's any woman who </v>

1014
00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:42.730
<v Speaker 4>could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter how hot like come and,</v>

1015
00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:43.040
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1016
00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:43.940
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1017
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:47.570
<v Speaker 4>take me away or like a forced me to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1018

<v Speaker 4>So deuce me.</v>

1019
00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:50.960
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here it is.</v>

1020
00:46:50.961 --> 00:46:53.540
<v Speaker 4>I think a woman could seduce you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now if I don't want her to.</v>

1021
00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.310
<v Speaker 4>I have an anecdote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anecdote.</v>

1022
00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:02.540
<v Speaker 4>I have an antidote and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been development over years and </v>

1023
00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:02.540
<v Speaker 4>people that can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1024
00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:07.600
<v Speaker 4>listening can take this if you like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you fell for somebody and she </v>

1025
00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:11.760
<v Speaker 4>liked him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she dumped you and you're still pining </v>

1026
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:11.760
<v Speaker 4>over her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Put her first.</v>

1027
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:16.361
<v Speaker 4>You'd like think about like the blood </v>
<v Speaker 4>moving through her body and her and her </v>

1028
00:47:16.361 --> 00:47:19.270
<v Speaker 4>skeleton and you put her on the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think about like she's making bio.</v>

1029
00:47:19.271 --> 00:47:20.540
<v Speaker 4>I know this is gross,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's.</v>

1030
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:24.860
<v Speaker 4>You think about her as this animal and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you think about her on the toilet.</v>

1031
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:27.670
<v Speaker 4>Whenever she pops up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put her on the toilet.</v>

1032
00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 5>You're welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't work with me.</v>

1033
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:31.510
<v Speaker 1>It will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't care.</v>

1034
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1035
00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:34.120
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I think she's hot,</v>

1036
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.100
<v Speaker 1>but she's really struggling on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>toilet.</v>

1037
00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.490
<v Speaker 1>I was struggling the toilet so you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>not judgmental.</v>

1038
00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat a lot,</v>

1039
00:47:42.461 --> 00:47:44.050
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take some horrific shits.</v>

1040
00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.750
<v Speaker 1>But think about like the bachelorette or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1041
00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:51.760
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fantasize a lot of times early on </v>

1042
00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.360
<v Speaker 1>there's this fantasy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1043
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:53.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1044
00:47:53.191 --> 00:47:54.400
<v Speaker 1>you're married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1045
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:55.710
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

1046
00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.760
<v Speaker 1>there's intimacy and you get past all </v>

<v Speaker 1>then you go up against yourself or go.</v>

1065
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I get bad breath and because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a person,</v>

1066
00:48:50.171 --> 00:48:52.390
<v Speaker 1>everybody gets bad breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I get bad breath,</v>

1067
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I want someone to tell me absolutely do </v>
<v Speaker 1>not want to be wandering around.</v>

1068
00:48:55.961 --> 00:48:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Grossing everybody out and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good to talk to you joe.</v>

<v Speaker 1>As soon as they turn their head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me.</v>

1071
00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:02.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

1072
00:49:02.131 --> 00:49:07.131
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take a listerine strip or chew gum </v>

1073
00:49:07.131 --> 00:49:07.131
<v Speaker 1>or whatever the fuck some people go </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>

1074
00:49:07.131 --> 00:49:09.460
<v Speaker 1>So I would tell her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people have an pr,</v>

1075
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:10.660
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an example.</v>

1076
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:14.170
<v Speaker 1>I was with this girl and I could not </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the breath.</v>

1077
00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't take it that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I said,</v>

1078
00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.190
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's brush our teeth.</v>

1079
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Was either it was either you gotta go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this.</v>

1080
00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I've got to figure out how to brush our </v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth.</v>

1081
00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:32.440
<v Speaker 1>So she brushed her teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reluctantly,</v>

1082
00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:38.640
<v Speaker 1>reluctantly brush my teeth clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't fix it at all like it was </v>

1083
00:49:41.591 --> 00:49:42.980
<v Speaker 1>coming from our gut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people have like,</v>

1084
00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:48.720
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens with a lot of girls who </v>

1085
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:48.810
<v Speaker 1>would believe or yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even anorexic or they gerd,</v>

1086
00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:50.950
<v Speaker 1>they regurgitate and bodies all fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1087
00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Your body's like super confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him as a data girl puked.</v>

1088
00:49:55.390 --> 00:50:00.390
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it until like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like deep into the relationship you had </v>

1089
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:02.710
<v Speaker 1>to is a couple months and then I found </v>
<v Speaker 1>out she was just saying like if she eats</v>

1090
00:50:02.711 --> 00:50:04.150
<v Speaker 1>too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll force yourself to throw up.</v>

1091
00:50:04.151 --> 00:50:05.080
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1092
00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.630
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to hide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>

1093
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean I knew it existed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know anybody who had it and</v>

1094
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:14.720
<v Speaker 1>that's a disturbing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you ate,</v>

1095
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:16.960
<v Speaker 1>you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you eat and then you're like,</v>

1096
00:50:16.961 --> 00:50:17.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have I done?</v>

1097
00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shove things in your mouth and force it </v>

1098
00:50:23.261 --> 00:50:25.360
<v Speaker 1>to come up again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1099
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:27.830
<v Speaker 1>did you guys talk about or that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

1100
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:28.580
<v Speaker 1>the relationship</v>

1101
00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:29.680
<v Speaker 5>new moved away?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1102
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:30.110
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1103
00:50:30.111 --> 00:50:33.660
<v Speaker 5>She brought it up and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well she did.</v>

1104
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:37.850
<v Speaker 5>This was the fucked up thing was she </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't in any way overweight.</v>

1105
00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:39.350
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was beautiful.</v>

1106
00:50:39.351 --> 00:50:41.110
<v Speaker 5>she had great body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She just,</v>

1107
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.460
<v Speaker 5>it was just like a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was an actress,</v>

1108
00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:47.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that that per the pressure,</v>

1109
00:50:47.601 --> 00:50:51.350
<v Speaker 5>that gig is just so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

1110
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.170
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you take someone who,</v>

1111
00:50:54.171 --> 00:50:59.171
<v Speaker 5>most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reason why we want to become an </v>

1112
00:50:59.171 --> 00:50:59.480
<v Speaker 5>actor is because they didn't get enough </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention.</v>

1113
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:04.600
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot of what causes it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially if you have like this weird </v>

1114
00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:08.300
<v Speaker 5>sort of nonspecific desire for fame.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you.</v>

1115
00:51:08.301 --> 00:51:13.301
<v Speaker 5>You're a really good character actress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know you're a faye dunaway or </v>

1116
00:51:13.301 --> 00:51:14.690
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just really good at.</v>

1117
00:51:14.691 --> 00:51:17.750
<v Speaker 5>You love the craft of creating a </v>
<v Speaker 5>character.</v>

1118
00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:19.580
<v Speaker 5>Now there's a lot of them.</v>

1119
00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:22.130
<v Speaker 5>They just want to be famous and why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why is that?</v>

1120
00:51:22.131 --> 00:51:24.710
<v Speaker 5>It's usually there's something fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 5>from childhood.</v>

1121
00:51:24.711 --> 00:51:26.630
<v Speaker 5>Usually somebody wasn't paying attention</v>
<v Speaker 5>to them.</v>

1122
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.840
<v Speaker 5>Parents split up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something went wrong.</v>

1123
00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:34.860
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you take this person that's super </v>

1124
00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:34.860
<v Speaker 5>insecure and as as exorbitant need for </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention,</v>

1125
00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.220
<v Speaker 5>and then you put them through this </v>
<v Speaker 5>audition process.</v>

1126
00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:40.130
<v Speaker 5>The audItion process is the craziest </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing ever.</v>

1127
00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 5>It devastates people's self esteem </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you just get rejected all the </v>

1128
00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:45.390
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rejected all the are.</v>

1129
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:46.940
<v Speaker 5>You're not selling a tee shirt that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1130
00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:48.500
<v Speaker 5>You're selling yourself like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1131
00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.090
<v Speaker 5>tonight's date.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This girl,</v>

1132
00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:55.840
<v Speaker 5>when I first moved to la and when she </v>
<v Speaker 5>would go on auditions,</v>

1133
00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:01.420
<v Speaker 5>when if she would get rejected,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she would want to fuck like a wild </v>

1134
00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:05.201
<v Speaker 5>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like she wanted something to just </v>

1135
00:52:05.201 --> 00:52:06.140
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She wanted to just fucking scream too.</v>

1136
00:52:06.141 --> 00:52:08.460
<v Speaker 5>She wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was,</v>

1137
00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:11.390
<v Speaker 5>it was the stress of it all was so </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>

1138
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:14.420
<v Speaker 5>She wanted validation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She wants to blow off steam.</v>

1139
00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:20.040
<v Speaker 5>It was just the stress of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so unhealthy and the people that go</v>

1140
00:52:20.661 --> 00:52:24.920
<v Speaker 5>into that are some of the most the </v>
<v Speaker 5>least.</v>

1141
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:28.430
<v Speaker 5>It's the least advisable career path for</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1142

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:15.670
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't make any sense at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

1162
00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.090
<v Speaker 5>why would you lie?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

1163
00:53:17.091 --> 00:53:21.050
<v Speaker 5>and then you just told me and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you ready to audition?</v>

1164

<v Speaker 5>look.</v>

1166

<v Speaker 5>told you.</v>

1167
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:34.610
<v Speaker 5>And then I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she had a sour look on her face and I </v>

1168
00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:37.251
<v Speaker 5>had to sing a line from a bruce </v>
<v Speaker 5>springsteen song to her in the audition.</v>

1169
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:43.100
<v Speaker 5>It was so humiliating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You auditioning for the band movie some </v>

1170
00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:48.260
<v Speaker 5>terrible movie.</v>

1173
00:53:51.631 --> 00:53:56.631
<v Speaker 5>I don't even remember.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think everyone would love to hear a </v>

1174
00:53:56.631 --> 00:53:56.631
<v Speaker 5>little bit right now.</v>

1175
00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:01.290
<v Speaker 5>We can dream.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>

1176
00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:03.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't even remember what he didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

00:54:04.501 --> 00:54:07.230

<v Speaker 5>but this is very,</v>

1180
00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:12.530
<v Speaker 5>very important moment for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I left and I real.</v>

1181
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:17.630
<v Speaker 5>That's when I realized I was like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This whole process for me at least is </v>

1182
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:18.990
<v Speaker 5>broken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm not good at this.</v>

1183
00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:24.340
<v Speaker 5>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not good at pretending to be </v>

<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They developed this real slick way of </v>

1192
00:54:43.881 --> 00:54:46.560
<v Speaker 5>talking and they don't say nice to meet </v>

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.570
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this way of doing it.</v>

1199
00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:03.090
<v Speaker 5>I was recognizing it the way they would </v>
<v Speaker 5>talk.</v>

1200
00:55:03.091 --> 00:55:06.030
<v Speaker 5>Everyone was like super left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super progressive.</v>

1201
00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:10.140
<v Speaker 5>No one explored ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just adopted whatever everybody else</v>

1202
00:55:10.141 --> 00:55:12.000
<v Speaker 5>was going with and ran with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yes,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hillary is so much more qualified.</v>

1204
00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.560
<v Speaker 5>He would just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People would just say shit like that.</v>

1205
00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:18.480
<v Speaker 5>It was just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was really strange.</v>

1206
00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:23.160
<v Speaker 5>They were like real obvious dEmocrat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They weren't thinking it through.</v>

1207
00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:28.280
<v Speaker 5>They had just adopted this mindset and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were just sneaking their way </v>

1208
00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:32.871
<v Speaker 5>through the system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were like exploiting little </v>

1209
00:55:32.871 --> 00:55:36.081
<v Speaker 5>personality holes in the system and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>would get become friends with casting </v>

1210
00:55:36.081 --> 00:55:39.921
<v Speaker 5>agents and one of the casting agents was</v>
<v Speaker 5>a woman I knew this one casting agent </v>

1211
00:55:39.921 --> 00:55:44.360
<v Speaker 5>who was friends with a friend of mine </v>
<v Speaker 5>and she was kind of gross and just being</v>

1212
00:55:44.521 --> 00:55:49.521
<v Speaker 5>nice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being kind by saying kinda and she </v>

1213
00:55:49.521 --> 00:55:51.030
<v Speaker 5>fucked all these actor guys and she </v>
<v Speaker 5>would want to know who this is.</v>

1214
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:52.140
<v Speaker 5>I cAn't tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

1215
00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:53.550
<v Speaker 5>she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's a nice lady.</v>

1216
00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:54.410
<v Speaker 5>She just slipped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's.</v>

1217
00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:56.430
<v Speaker 5>She was basically doing what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot.</v>

1218
00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:58.500
<v Speaker 5>She was doing the casting couch in </v>
<v Speaker 5>reverse.</v>

1219
00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:03.650
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But she was like aggressive sexually </v>

1220
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:03.840
<v Speaker 5>aggressive with guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

00:56:03.841 --> 00:56:06.690
<v Speaker 5>And one of my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's super sexually aggressive with one</v>

1222
00:56:06.691 --> 00:56:09.150
<v Speaker 5>of my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it a henrietta weinstein?</v>

1223
00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:13.770
<v Speaker 5>I can't tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh well she,</v>

1224
00:56:13.771 --> 00:56:15.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was,</v>

1225
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:19.890
<v Speaker 5>she was casting quite a few different </v>
<v Speaker 5>shows and she knew how to.</v>

1226
00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:21.870
<v Speaker 5>She knew hOw to get these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

1227
00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:26.900
<v Speaker 5>these exploit people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these guys that were saying good to see </v>

1228
00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:27.370
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those guys.</v>

1229
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.590
<v Speaker 5>She would fuck those guys because that </v>
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

1230
00:56:29.591 --> 00:56:31.690
<v Speaker 5>that was the way they could play it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1231
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:35.280
<v Speaker 4>that's what they get this when her </v>
<v Speaker 4>seduction,</v>

1232
00:56:35.281 --> 00:56:37.570
<v Speaker 4>when I don't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'S brutal though.</v>

1233
00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.210
<v Speaker 4>Auditioning I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm terrible.</v>

1234
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:43.360
<v Speaker 4>I booked one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've gotten like sketch shows,</v>

1235
00:56:43.361 --> 00:56:47.620
<v Speaker 4>but I've only booked one show where it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was like a script.</v>

1236
00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:48.910
<v Speaker 4>A guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a sitcom.</v>

1237
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000
<v Speaker 4>I booked like a guest starring thing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went in and I'm a terrible reader and </v>

1238
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.351
<v Speaker 4>for the read through they do a read </v>
<v Speaker 4>through with a network like at a couple </v>

1239
00:56:58.351 --> 00:56:58.960
<v Speaker 4>days before they shoot and they gave me </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1240
00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:00.460
<v Speaker 4>oh you have eight new lines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

1241
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:03.120
<v Speaker 4>and I can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read like a third grader.</v>

1242
00:57:03.121 --> 00:57:08.121
<v Speaker 4>I very poor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I the big table read through and I </v>

1243
00:57:08.281 --> 00:57:09.960
<v Speaker 4>stammered through the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have fired.</v>

1244
00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:14.120
<v Speaker 4>So the only show I booked really off </v>
<v Speaker 4>typical audition,</v>

1245
00:57:14.121 --> 00:57:17.320
<v Speaker 4>reading a script.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was fired from jesus christ.</v>

1246
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:20.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean so many wasted hours memorizing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>paying,</v>

1247
00:57:20.241 --> 00:57:22.070
<v Speaker 4>acting coach and none of it worked out </v>
<v Speaker 4>for me.</v>

1248
00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:25.910
<v Speaker 4>It was a lie because I get really </v>
<v Speaker 4>nervous.</v>

1249
00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:28.540
<v Speaker 4>I feel very judged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel very uncomfortable.</v>

1250
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:33.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm a terrible reader so I ended up like</v>
<v Speaker 4>having to memorize it and then most of </v>

1251
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:38.731
<v Speaker 4>my time is like trying to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just basically get too nervous as </v>

1252
00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:43.780
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever try to like see a hypnotist</v>

1253
00:57:43.781 --> 00:57:45.390
<v Speaker 4>or anything like that or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1254
00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:48.370
<v Speaker 4>but that probably would've been a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea because it wasn't mental.</v>

1255
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:51.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut down.</v>

1256
00:57:51.641 --> 00:57:52.470
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1257
00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.660
<v Speaker 4>some people just react,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't help how you react,</v>

1258
00:57:55.661 --> 00:57:58.720
<v Speaker 4>but it's like if you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're afraid of bees for example,</v>

1259
00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:02.580
<v Speaker 4>it's like go in and audition with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of bees flying around.</v>

1260
00:58:02.581 --> 00:58:03.780
<v Speaker 4>You did your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1261
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:08.790
<v Speaker 4>your body is reacting in a fear way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard to grab your facilities</v>

1262
00:58:08.791 --> 00:58:12.030
<v Speaker 4>to act or whatever you're doing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible,</v>

1263
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:14.710
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So no,</v>

1264
00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:15.670
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1265
00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:18.030
<v Speaker 5>especially if you think like this god,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this could be it.</v>

1266
00:58:18.031 --> 00:58:23.031
<v Speaker 5>This is the big moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the worst ways for you to behave </v>

1267
00:58:23.031 --> 00:58:25.480
<v Speaker 5>like or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or to perform rather in something that's</v>

1268
00:58:25.481 --> 00:58:30.481
<v Speaker 5>like really important,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially with an acting situation </v>

1269
00:58:30.481 --> 00:58:31.300
<v Speaker 5>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to pretend to be in love</v>

1270
00:58:31.301 --> 00:58:35.650
<v Speaker 5>or to pretend to be happy and whatever </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fuck it is.</v>

1271
00:58:35.651 --> 00:58:40.651
<v Speaker 5>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all you're thinking is don't fuck this </v>

1272
00:58:40.651 --> 00:58:40.651
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't,</v>

1273
00:58:40.651 --> 00:58:42.960
<v Speaker 5>don't fuck this up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's like the overlying mantra to </v>

1274
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:42.960
<v Speaker 5>all your thoughts</v>

1275
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:42.960
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do this.</v>

1276
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:46.090
<v Speaker 4>Correct is not the great mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Were you going to do a good performance?</v>

1277
00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:48.880
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm A,</v>

1278
00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:54.980
<v Speaker 4>just fell out of my head whenever I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>about to say I was going to be </v>

1279
00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:58.970
<v Speaker 4>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the best part of the show was </v>

1280
00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.970
<v Speaker 4>going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1281
00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:02.360
<v Speaker 5>but this is one of the reasons why so </v>
<v Speaker 5>many people are so crazy out here.</v>

1282
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:07.750
<v Speaker 5>It's like come here crazy and then the </v>
<v Speaker 5>system gets some crazier and then you </v>

1283
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:11.351
<v Speaker 5>also realize that unless you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like what you're doing or you </v>

1284
00:59:11.351 --> 00:59:14.800
<v Speaker 5>just doing your own thing on instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody has to pick you to work.</v>

1285
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.190
<v Speaker 5>You have to get picked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is just nuts.</v>

1286
00:59:18.191 --> 00:59:23.191
<v Speaker 5>like as comics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all we have to do is just go to an open </v>

1287
00:59:23.191 --> 00:59:23.630
<v Speaker 5>mic night practice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1288
00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.730

<v Speaker 5>then a couple of years after that,</v>

<v Speaker 5>a middle and a couple of like,</v>

1298
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:48.480
<v Speaker 5>I can't imagine just being an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forget it.</v>

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:49.880
<v Speaker 5>They go crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I have friends that are just actors.</v>

1301
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:55.880
<v Speaker 5>They go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They all go crazy by the time they're in</v>

1302
00:59:55.881 --> 01:00:00.881
<v Speaker 5>their forties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're out of their fucking mind and </v>

1303
01:00:00.881 --> 01:00:00.881
<v Speaker 5>women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh the,</v>

1304
01:00:00.881 --> 01:00:04.430
<v Speaker 5>that they feel like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they feel like they have this little </v>

1305
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:05.910
<v Speaker 5>tiny ass hourglass and it's just running</v>
<v Speaker 5>us and everyday.</v>

1306
01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:08.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like you said,</v>

1307
01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:12.200
<v Speaker 5>it's a lot of times you're not starting </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the most secure people.</v>

1308
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:13.820
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost never.</v>

1309
01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:19.130
<v Speaker 5>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got on stage because I was in so much </v>

1310
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:20.870
<v Speaker 5>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I literally like was pushed.</v>

1311
01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:23.240
<v Speaker 5>I was in college.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had like no friends.</v>

1312
01:00:23.590 --> 01:00:25.340
<v Speaker 5>I really painting a pretty picture </v>
<v Speaker 5>myself today.</v>

1313
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:26.540
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1314
01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.620
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted like,</v>

1315
01:00:27.621 --> 01:00:30.800
<v Speaker 5>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that really was the first impulse.</v>

1316
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:34.460
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1317
01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:39.230
<v Speaker 5>but sometimes that leads to the funniest</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit in the funniest people like this,</v>

1318
01:00:39.231 --> 01:00:42.890
<v Speaker 5>that pressure one way that throws you in</v>
<v Speaker 5>another direction.</v>

1319
01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean not that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that bad feeling when you just trying to</v>

1320
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:49.490
<v Speaker 5>escape that bad feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the energy and the desire to escape that</v>

1321
01:00:49.491 --> 01:00:52.640
<v Speaker 5>bad feeling is so intense that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>creates a good feeling.</v>

1322
01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.850
<v Speaker 5>And after a while though it flips to </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1323
01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.600
<v Speaker 5>now I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1324
01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes I don't want to be looked at,</v>

1325
01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if I got into a bad spot I'd </v>

1326
01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.501
<v Speaker 5>want to go on stage again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But sometimes do you ever feel like </v>

1327
01:01:08.501 --> 01:01:09.080
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you just don't feel like being,</v>

1328
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:13.580
<v Speaker 5>like look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm like,</v>

1329
01:01:13.581 --> 01:01:18.581
<v Speaker 5>that's not what happens with you </v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes I don't feel like going on </v>

1330
01:01:18.581 --> 01:01:18.581
<v Speaker 5>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1331
01:01:18.581 --> 01:01:18.581
<v Speaker 5>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1332
01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.050
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1333
01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:24.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that I've been doing </v>

1334
01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.751
<v Speaker 5>lately is for a long time I never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hardly took any time off.</v>

1335
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:28.070
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after I did my special,</v>

1336
01:01:28.071 --> 01:01:32.120
<v Speaker 5>I Just filmed a special in april,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took a month off.</v>

1337
01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.770
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do any stand up for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1338
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:36.610
<v Speaker 5>At least like three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1339
01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:39.140
<v Speaker 5>Like three maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might've been Four weeks,</v>

1340
01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.540
<v Speaker 5>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing shit.</v>

1341
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:46.190
<v Speaker 5>I went to Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucking hung out.</v>

1342
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:51.250
<v Speaker 5>I did podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do any stand up and it felt </v>

1343
01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:55.391
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It felt great that I would leave here </v>

1344
01:01:55.391 --> 01:01:55.391
<v Speaker 5>and I'd be done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't,</v>

1345
01:01:55.391 --> 01:01:56.960
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't have another gig to go to at </v>
<v Speaker 5>night.</v>

1346
01:01:57.170 --> 01:02:02.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know there wasn't this overwhelming </v>

1347
01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:02.170
<v Speaker 5>thing looming in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1348
01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.820
<v Speaker 5>But after awhile I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

1349
01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:05.750
<v Speaker 5>gotta,</v>

1355
01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 5>because I feel like this instagram gave </v>
<v Speaker 5>me</v>

1356
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:25.010
<v Speaker 4>a little confidence of bring that into </v>

01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.570
<v Speaker 4>sitcom so they could take it away from </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1366
01:02:45.571 --> 01:02:47.640
<v Speaker 4>Once your ex girlfriend says you were </v>

<v Speaker 4>They were trying to get people to </v>

1374
01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:03.150
<v Speaker 4>basically put together an audition for a</v>

<v Speaker 4>and some people have the confidence and </v>

1379
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:16.551
<v Speaker 4>not to listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember zach alpha eczema was one of </v>

1380
01:03:16.551 --> 01:03:16.551
<v Speaker 4>the guys who like didn't want to be on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>sitcom,</v>

1381
01:03:16.551 --> 01:03:16.590
<v Speaker 4>and I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1382
01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.810
<v Speaker 4>I didn't believe him because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what we all have.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1384
01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.520

<v Speaker 4>I got like out into the world without </v>

1385
01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:30.261
<v Speaker 4>really having confidence in myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like to make a decision to do something.</v>

1386
01:03:30.631 --> 01:03:34.220
<v Speaker 4>I really felt like I needed someone to </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell me that he does his experiment.</v>

1387
01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:39.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm explain this and explain myself real</v>
<v Speaker 4>quick where they did this in the </v>

1388
01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:39.340
<v Speaker 4>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd rattle,</v>

1389
01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:42.150
<v Speaker 4>rattle in front of a baby and the mom </v>
<v Speaker 4>would do this and baby would like it.</v>

1390
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:47.150
<v Speaker 4>Then that you haven't keep rattling it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the baby would start to push it </v>

1391
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.150
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They haven't keep rallying the.</v>

1392
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:49.590
<v Speaker 4>They will start crying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All babies go through this exact thing.</v>

1393
01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:52.440
<v Speaker 4>Then after the crying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have them keep rattling it,</v>

1394
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:57.030
<v Speaker 4>which is something they would never do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now at the last phase of the baby's numb</v>

1395
01:03:57.031 --> 01:03:59.120
<v Speaker 4>out and start drooling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

1396
01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:01.020
<v Speaker 4>and that's how I lead came into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

1397
01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:05.010
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like I'm waking up now a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit.</v>

1398
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:07.950
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking dark that they did that </v>
<v Speaker 4>to a baby.</v>

1399
01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.560
<v Speaker 4>Only the seven is what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That.</v>

1400
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:13.770
<v Speaker 4>How many people did they fuck up in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies?</v>

1401
01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:16.860
<v Speaker 4>I know the brown eyed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blue eyed experiment.</v>

1402
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:21.890
<v Speaker 4>Remember that this they told a classroom</v>
<v Speaker 4>of kids blue.</v>

1403
01:04:22.411 --> 01:04:26.400
<v Speaker 4>White people are smarter and better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brown eyed people are to kids.</v>

1404
01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:29.130
<v Speaker 4>So then the blue eyed people started,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1405
01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:30.930
<v Speaker 4>doing better work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>behaving better.</v>

1406
01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:35.930
<v Speaker 4>The brown eyed kids started misbehaving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they switched it to like we were </v>

1407
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:36.330
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The broWn eyed kids are the ones who are</v>

1408
01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:39.000
<v Speaker 4>smarter and better and the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>switched.</v>

1409
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:41.940
<v Speaker 4>So they do it as a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiment just to see.</v>

1410
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:44.040
<v Speaker 4>Likes to fuck with kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really fuck them up.</v>

1411
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:46.410
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you tell kids that they're shit,</v>

1412
01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.090
<v Speaker 4>they feel like their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1413
01:04:48.091 --> 01:04:49.470
<v Speaker 4>You don't really need to do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiment.</v>

1414
01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:50.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't do that.</v>

1415
01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:55.620
<v Speaker 4>Go do the opposite of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that we're talking now about like</v>

1416
01:04:55.621 --> 01:04:58.980
<v Speaker 4>the effects on kids with the trump thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the border.</v>

1417
01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.920
<v Speaker 4>It's so dark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so.</v>

1418
01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:06.930

<v Speaker 4>care to use.</v>

1450
01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:30.451
<v Speaker 5>to any I ideology or religion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's still a good idea to think that </v>

<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

<v Speaker 5>like the idea that no atheist can be </v>

01:06:42.701 --> 01:06:46.840
<v Speaker 5>president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No atheists and no single guys.</v>

<v Speaker 5>bombs.</v>

1458
01:06:52.751 --> 01:06:53.620

1459
01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:59.710
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly how it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is what would happen.</v>

1460
01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:01.030
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could you.</v>

1461
01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:06.060
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that it's possible to have </v>
<v Speaker 5>a single guy or gal as the president?</v>

1462
01:07:06.611 --> 01:07:09.250
<v Speaker 5>I do not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do not think it's possible.</v>

1463
01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:12.430
<v Speaker 5>It's got a stigma.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People would get weirded out by you.</v>

1464
01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:14.260
<v Speaker 5>How old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're 49.</v>

1465
01:07:14.261 --> 01:07:16.960
<v Speaker 5>You don't even have any kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You fucking weirdo.</v>

1466
01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.880
<v Speaker 5>You don't have a wife.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even a sing.</v>

1467
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:23.360
<v Speaker 5>Even at guy who's married with no kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people will be like,</v>

1468
01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:28.400
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's not like us because you could be </v>

1469
01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.730
<v Speaker 5>married with kids and I could be single </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't feel weirded by you.</v>

1470
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:32.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't feel like this is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>weirdo,</v>

1471
01:07:32.501 --> 01:07:35.380
<v Speaker 5>what's he doing on married with kids </v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's a normal path,</v>

1472
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:40.660
<v Speaker 5>but it's not a normal path to be like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>55 year old guy with no wife.</v>

1473
01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:41.650
<v Speaker 5>No kids.</v>

1474
01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:43.450
<v Speaker 5>Never been married.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1475
01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:46.610
<v Speaker 5>No desire to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because like when you're,</v>

1476
01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:49.510
<v Speaker 5>it seems like you're more stable if the </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole family for sure.</v>

1477
01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:51.670
<v Speaker 5>But you have something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have some skin in the game,</v>

1478
01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you care about your kids.</v>

1479
01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:58.620
<v Speaker 5>That's true too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to like blow up the </v>

1480
01:07:58.620 --> 01:07:58.620
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like that sting song.</v>

1481
01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:00.580
<v Speaker 5>If the russians love their children too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>amount of pall mall.</v>

1563
01:11:20.491 --> 01:11:22.920
<v Speaker 1>So you just kept pumping on these pall </v>
<v Speaker 1>malls.</v>

1564
01:11:22.921 --> 01:11:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Just smoked him constantly and his gut </v>
<v Speaker 1>had become distended,</v>

1565
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:28.740
<v Speaker 1>like you was pregnant</v>

1566
01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.010
<v Speaker 5>and it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was as rotten with cancer.</v>

1567
01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.360
<v Speaker 5>Like his whole body was just fucked up </v>

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that craig character and he just </v>

1617
01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:46.250
<v Speaker 1>felt it was too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1618
01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:47.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retarded or something.</v>

01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He played say yeah.</v>

1620

<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

1621
01:13:53.871 --> 01:13:55.520
<v Speaker 1>he'd never swung back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1622
01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:56.630
<v Speaker 5>he does.</v>

1623
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Just roll with the punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1624
01:13:59.110 --> 01:14:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Would you do a talk show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1625
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:05.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing one right now with one on </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram.</v>

1626
01:14:07.271 --> 01:14:10.960
<v Speaker 1>kyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst name on instagram.</v>

1627
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Why would I do that?</v>

1628
01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:17.680
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't seem like a good way to talk </v>

1629
01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.000
<v Speaker 5>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't seem like it's fun.</v>

1630
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:22.570
<v Speaker 5>It seems like it's too much pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like there's too many people.</v>

1631
01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:27.490
<v Speaker 5>It seems like the conversations become </v>
<v Speaker 5>fake because you have five minutes until</v>

1632
01:14:27.491 --> 01:14:32.491
<v Speaker 5>you cut to commercial and they come over</v>
<v Speaker 5>with cars and the executive wants to </v>

1633
01:14:32.491 --> 01:14:33.910
<v Speaker 5>talk to you and the producers want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get in your ear and.</v>

<v Speaker 5>a little it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we're,</v>

01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:46.210
<v Speaker 5>How many balls did I get into games that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we played?</v>

1668
01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:50.290
<v Speaker 5>Even made one ball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did get a call that you made one.</v>

1669
01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.730
<v Speaker 5>Got it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's not bad.</v>

1670
01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:55.840
<v Speaker 5>went where you wanted it to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You aimed,</v>

1671
01:15:55.841 --> 01:15:56.950
<v Speaker 5>you shot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you fired.</v>

1672
01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:59.560
<v Speaker 5>It went in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was really emasculating.</v>

1673
01:15:59.590 --> 01:16:01.810
<v Speaker 5>Those two games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It shouldn't be two things.</v>

1674
01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:06.840
<v Speaker 5>One the tAble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't tell you because I didn't want </v>

1675
01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:06.840
<v Speaker 5>to freak you out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

1676
01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:06.840
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very tiny pockets.</v>

1677
01:16:06.850 --> 01:16:09.100
<v Speaker 5>The pockets are much smaller than a </v>
<v Speaker 5>normal table.</v>

1678
01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:11.860
<v Speaker 5>That table has five and a half inch </v>
<v Speaker 5>pockets.</v>

1679
01:16:11.890 --> 01:16:15.460
<v Speaker 5>That table is four inch pockets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're actually slightly under four.</v>

1680
01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're really small,</v>

1681
01:16:17.021 --> 01:16:17.990
<v Speaker 5>so it's hard to get a ball.</v>

1682
01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:20.680
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I play on it everyday.</v>

1683
01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:23.390
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't hard for you to get the ball </v>
<v Speaker 5>and just want to say that.</v>

1684
01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:26.590
<v Speaker 5>I told you I planted every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>

<v Speaker 5>after we're done,</v>

1686
01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:30.550

<v Speaker 5>That's how I unwind.</v>

1687

<v Speaker 5>That's the only game I'm good at it.</v>

1691

1696

<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1697
01:16:55.350 --> 01:17:00.350
<v Speaker 5>It requires so much concentration and so</v>
<v Speaker 5>many things have to be in line that as </v>

1698
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:01.210
<v Speaker 5>you're thinking of all those different </v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Very meditative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You ever read zen and the art of </v>

<v Speaker 5>Interesting book.</v>

1703
01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:14.800
<v Speaker 5>It's funny because my friend John Dudley</v>
<v Speaker 5>read it and recommended it to me and </v>

1704
01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.000

<v Speaker 5>and he's a world class archer.</v>

1705
01:17:17.001 --> 01:17:22.001
<v Speaker 5>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just got back from europe where they </v>

1706
01:17:22.001 --> 01:17:22.130
<v Speaker 5>flew him out to coach various,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1707
01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:24.130
<v Speaker 5>international teams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>LIke he's a,</v>

1708
01:17:24.131 --> 01:17:28.190
<v Speaker 5>like a real world class coach and archer</v>
<v Speaker 5>himself.</v>

<v Speaker 5>this book is really good,</v>

1711
01:17:31.611 --> 01:17:36.611
<v Speaker 5>but I have a feeling that the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrote it wasn't really that good at </v>

1712
01:17:36.611 --> 01:17:36.611
<v Speaker 5>archery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>

<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1714
01:17:36.861 --> 01:17:38.840
<v Speaker 5>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the guy he goes,</v>

1715
01:17:38.841 --> 01:17:41.000
<v Speaker 5>I feel like he was kind of there but not</v>
<v Speaker 5>quite.</v>

1716
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:42.830
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting.</v>

1717
01:17:42.831 --> 01:17:46.910
<v Speaker 5>Coming from a guy who's a real master,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like recognizes some something,</v>

1718
01:17:46.911 --> 01:17:51.911
<v Speaker 5>some errors in his thinking or the way </v>
<v Speaker 5>describes things or his approach really </v>

1719
01:17:52.491 --> 01:17:52.970
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

1720
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.010
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you never have to ask me again.</v>

1721
01:17:55.011 --> 01:17:57.890
<v Speaker 5>Did you read that book?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did not read any books.</v>

1722
01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.800
<v Speaker 5>I haven't read a book in a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank god.</v>

01:18:22.871 --> 01:18:23.090
<v Speaker 5>then I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is too much work.</v>

1731
01:18:23.091 --> 01:18:24.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to listen to it in my </v>
<v Speaker 5>car.</v>

1732
01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.450
<v Speaker 5>I just listened to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

1733
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:31.550
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's a lot of dead time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of time that's not being </v>

1734
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:34.970
<v Speaker 5>used and that time is when I'm driving </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm always driving here.</v>

1735
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:38.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm driving to the gym or I'm driving </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the comedy store.</v>

1736
01:18:38.451 --> 01:18:42.140
<v Speaker 5>I'm driving to the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fill that up with books on tape.</v>

1737
01:18:42.170 --> 01:18:44.210

<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1738
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:47.180
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mostly like right now I'm reading,</v>

1739
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:52.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm reading the tipping point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a malcolm gladwell book and I'm</v>

1740
01:18:52.011 --> 01:18:55.520
<v Speaker 5>also reading sapiens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is who wrote sapiens.</v>

1741
01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.570

<v Speaker 5>The tipping point is great.</v>

1742
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:01.610
<v Speaker 5>It's really great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really interesting.</v>

1743
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:05.600
<v Speaker 5>And also felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who is it?</v>

1744
01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.110

<v Speaker 5>a brief history of humankind.</v>

1751

<v Speaker 5>Very enlightening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1752
01:19:21.710 --> 01:19:26.710
<v Speaker 5>That tipping point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel it could have been three </v>

1753
01:19:26.710 --> 01:19:26.710
<v Speaker 5>sentences long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

01:19:26.710 --> 01:19:27.050
<v Speaker 5>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a little,</v>

1755
01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:28.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is.</v>

1756

<v Speaker 5>I get it after awhile.</v>

1757
01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.350
<v Speaker 5>Like I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a bunch of things collide together</v>

1758
01:19:33.351 --> 01:19:35.230
<v Speaker 5>and anything can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the next thing,</v>

1759
01:19:35.231 --> 01:19:39.950
<v Speaker 5>no hush puppies are really popular.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My tipping point was joe rogan played my</v>

1760
01:19:39.951 --> 01:19:41.930
<v Speaker 5>instagram videos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not crazy.</v>

1761
01:19:41.970 --> 01:19:44.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the only tipping point that makes</v>

1762
01:19:44.421 --> 01:19:46.160
<v Speaker 5>me very happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love doing that.</v>

1765
01:19:50.081 --> 01:19:52.370

<v Speaker 5>need some favor.</v>

<v Speaker 5>of Donald Trump to deal with it.</v>

1768
01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:04.480
<v Speaker 5>You really are worried about the time I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was going to kill time on the floor.</v>

1769
01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:07.000
<v Speaker 5>It might be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what,</v>

1770
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:09.280
<v Speaker 5>what It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Consumer now take it back.</v>

1771
01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:11.970
<v Speaker 5>When people do kill themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you gotta go,</v>

1772
01:20:11.971 --> 01:20:16.971
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many times did this person think </v>

1773
01:20:16.971 --> 01:20:16.971
<v Speaker 5>about this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1774
01:20:16.971 --> 01:20:21.560
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many times did they get close and </v>

1775
01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:21.560
<v Speaker 5>they didn't want.</v>

1776
01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:22.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't have that in me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1777
01:20:22.691 --> 01:20:23.780
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

1778
01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:28.860
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's because I take care of </v>

1779
01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:28.860
<v Speaker 5>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's genetic,</v>

1780
01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:30.380
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's because I live a happy life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Basically locked pro.</v>

1781
01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:32.540
<v Speaker 5>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

1782
01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.700
<v Speaker 5>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think luck is a big thing.</v>

1783
01:20:34.701 --> 01:20:36.100
<v Speaker 5>It's a big factor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

01:20:36.101 --> 01:20:41.101
<v Speaker 5>I have a friend who killed himself and </v>
<v Speaker 5>his brother had killed himself before </v>

1785
01:20:41.101 --> 01:20:43.400
<v Speaker 5>that and everybody loved him and it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>just stunning to everybody.</v>

1790
01:20:53.010 --> 01:20:56.240

<v Speaker 4>around and tag things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never quite figured it out.</v>

1802
01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:30.640
<v Speaker 4>He was sweating like a pig and running </v>
<v Speaker 4>around behind it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>So this is two.</v>

1845
01:23:31.530 --> 01:23:33.940
<v Speaker 5>They put their fucking hand on their </v>
<v Speaker 5>heart and they go,</v>

1846
01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:39.030
<v Speaker 5>I pledge allegiance to the flag of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>United States of America and to the </v>

1847
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:42.301
<v Speaker 5>republic for which is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they get into it like full </v>

1848
01:23:42.301 --> 01:23:44.140
<v Speaker 5>earnestness and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're looking at each other,</v>

1849
01:23:44.141 --> 01:23:49.141
<v Speaker 5>me and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think ari or duncan was with me and </v>

1850
01:23:49.141 --> 01:23:51.670
<v Speaker 5>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what in the fuck did you play along?</v>

1851
01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:57.570
<v Speaker 5>Well I would if it was like a game or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that and you know,</v>

1852
01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.470
<v Speaker 5>stand for the flag.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1853
01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.510
<v Speaker 5>I'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to make anybody feel bad.</v>

1854
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:04.570
<v Speaker 5>That's not what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a radio show.</v>

1855
01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:07.300
<v Speaker 5>You're in the middle of the radio show </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you do a pledge of allegiance.</v>

1856
01:24:07.301 --> 01:24:10.390
<v Speaker 5>So what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you stay just stay still or.</v>

1857
01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:11.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1858
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:14.710
<v Speaker 5>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember being high as fuck.</v>

1859
01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:19.060
<v Speaker 5>So it made it extra weird because </v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever I would do those radio shows,</v>

1860
01:24:19.061 --> 01:24:21.490
<v Speaker 5>we would just meet downstairs because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1861
01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:23.320
<v Speaker 5>you got to be at them at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the morning,</v>

1862
01:24:23.321 --> 01:24:28.321
<v Speaker 5>you're exhausted and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't necessarily really want to do </v>

1863
01:24:28.321 --> 01:24:32.431
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we would meet downstairs and get </v>

1864
01:24:32.431 --> 01:24:35.800
<v Speaker 5>becu and so then it was an adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like everything was free that the</v>

1865
01:24:35.801 --> 01:24:36.850
<v Speaker 5>wind was scaring me.</v>

1866
01:24:36.850 --> 01:24:37.500
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1867
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:39.400
<v Speaker 5>where's the car that's taking us to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the car?</v>

1868
01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:41.740
<v Speaker 5>And then we talked to the people and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was always like,</v>

1869
01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.910
<v Speaker 5>all right to the driver,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1870
01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:47.911
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's the biggest dickhead you've ever </v>

1871
01:24:47.911 --> 01:24:50.011
<v Speaker 5>had to drive?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because there's always like one story </v>

1872
01:24:50.011 --> 01:24:51.910
<v Speaker 5>comedians that hated being there and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was always.</v>

1873
01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.530
<v Speaker 5>I would hear you would hear a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

1874
01:24:53.531 --> 01:24:55.760
<v Speaker 5>but like disgruntled,</v>
<v Speaker 5>angry people.</v>

1875
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:57.430
<v Speaker 5>One of them was always richard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jenny.</v>

1876
01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.350
<v Speaker 5>There was always at richard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shannon was always properly.</v>

1877
01:24:59.430 --> 01:25:04.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>richard genuine because he never wanted </v>

1878
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.430
<v Speaker 5>to be that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He never wanted to be the road.</v>

1879
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:07.600
<v Speaker 5>He wanted to be that guy who put </v>
<v Speaker 5>together the act that got them the jerry</v>

1880
01:25:07.601 --> 01:25:09.080
<v Speaker 5>seinfeld sitcom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

1881
01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:14.280
<v Speaker 5>and meanwhile he was one of the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 5>standup comedians of all time.</v>

1882
01:25:15.130 --> 01:25:20.130
<v Speaker 5>You saw him a bunch of times when I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming up and a bunch of times in clubs </v>

1883
01:25:20.201 --> 01:25:25.201
<v Speaker 5>and he was a fucking killer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like one of the most unheralded and </v>

1884
01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:28.090
<v Speaker 5>unappreciated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>underappreciated standups of all time.</v>

1885
01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:29.830
<v Speaker 5>He's the only one of my all time </v>
<v Speaker 5>favorites,</v>

1886
01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:31.720
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was bumming me out.</v>

1887
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:33.490
<v Speaker 5>I would hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was miserable.</v>

1888
01:25:33.491 --> 01:25:35.710
<v Speaker 5>He didn't want to talk to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was all bummed out.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He was still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He like,</v>

1892
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:46.510
<v Speaker 5>did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It went wrong.</v>

1893

1901
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:15.110
<v Speaker 1>It's so common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to be a person.</v>

1902
01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.140
<v Speaker 1>We're the first species that knows we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to die.</v>

1903
01:26:18.170 --> 01:26:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Very aware of our like impending death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That right there.</v>

1904
01:26:21.441 --> 01:26:24.080
<v Speaker 1>You need to medicate that species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you looked at a chart,</v>

1905
01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:27.170
<v Speaker 1>the evolution of monkeys,</v>

<v Speaker 1>get very religious,</v>

1909
01:26:33.441 --> 01:26:36.290
<v Speaker 1>which is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of them we got to medicate this</v>

1910
01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:36.920
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1912
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:41.800
<v Speaker 1>we used to die young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was like you wouldn't have to deal</v>

1913
01:26:41.801 --> 01:26:46.801
<v Speaker 1>on yourself because you only live to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>30 and now we have so much more time on </v>

<v Speaker 1>and then collapse.</v>

1916
01:26:50.021 --> 01:26:51.200
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting around and I could think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

1917
01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see yourself getting older every day</v>

<v Speaker 1>I like tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tough to get some bursitis.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I do feel more comfortable.</v>

1925
01:27:12.771 --> 01:27:17.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling less anxious in some ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>more another.</v>

1926
01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm pretty.</v>

1927
01:27:19.041 --> 01:27:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Even though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1928
01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:25.420
<v Speaker 1>you're more aware of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you're also going to be more </v>

1929
01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:28.391
<v Speaker 1>aware of your impending demise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't live long enough like we need </v>

1930
01:27:28.391 --> 01:27:32.451
<v Speaker 1>to live 500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about the first hundred </v>

1931
01:27:32.451 --> 01:27:34.400
<v Speaker 1>years to fix like your childhood stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she imagined though.</v>

1932
01:27:34.401 --> 01:27:38.210
<v Speaker 1>If you did leave live 500 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you be dating like 100 year old?</v>

1933
01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:42.170
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like these fucking 100 year olds</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know shit.</v>

1934
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:46.730
<v Speaker 1>She said she doesn't know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hadn't been around.</v>

1935
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you imagine if you were 500 years old</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you were dating a 30 year old people</v>

1936
01:27:50.181 --> 01:27:52.010
<v Speaker 1>will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

1937
01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:54.200
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why not?</v>

1938
01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:56.990
<v Speaker 1>She's a grown ass woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's 30 years old.</v>

1939
01:27:56.991 --> 01:27:58.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a grown ass woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1940
01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Like a 30 year old could data 50 year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

1941
01:28:01.190 --> 01:28:03.290
<v Speaker 1>60 year old and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd better be rich.</v>

1942
01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.410
<v Speaker 1>A 70 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like something that'd be going on.</v>

1943

1945
01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:21.250
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think though that there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain requirement of a lack of </v>

1946
01:28:21.321 --> 01:28:26.321
<v Speaker 1>maturity to be funny to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some of the shit that you did in </v>

<v Speaker 1>it's horrible.</v>

1958
01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:53.870
<v Speaker 1>That family must be like to have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to them.</v>

1959
01:28:53.871 --> 01:28:58.510
<v Speaker 1>They lose their loved one and then to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see her just like completely around just</v>

1960
01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.630
<v Speaker 1>hero of the year and all that rich man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ma'am</v>

1961
01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:07.640
<v Speaker 4>smudger now baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a show called lost in </v>

1962
01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:11.751
<v Speaker 4>transition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I recommend highlights people </v>

1963
01:29:11.751 --> 01:29:13.440
<v Speaker 4>transitioning and it's a lot of old </v>
<v Speaker 4>people in their fifties and stuff.</v>

1964
01:29:13.710 --> 01:29:15.780
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's weird about it.</v>

1965
01:29:15.781 --> 01:29:20.781
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's a lot of it is people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have kind of given up on sex don't </v>

1966
01:29:20.781 --> 01:29:21.250
<v Speaker 4>even want to have sex anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1967
01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:23.560
<v Speaker 4>Which is one of the things that caitlin </v>
<v Speaker 4>said.</v>

1968
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:25.820
<v Speaker 4>Sex is kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>

1969
01:29:25.821 --> 01:29:26.220
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1970
01:29:26.250 --> 01:29:30.060
<v Speaker 4>But then why I snippety snip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1971
01:29:30.061 --> 01:29:34.080
<v Speaker 4>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say that they become like teenagers</v>

1972
01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:39.140
<v Speaker 4>when they do transition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was like a period where they're </v>

1973
01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:40.620
<v Speaker 4>feeling this teenage feel that coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>into their own finally,</v>

1974
01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:42.930
<v Speaker 4>but they're older men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1975
01:29:42.931 --> 01:29:47.931
<v Speaker 4>when it had this period in caitlin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they kind of got caught it on that show </v>

1976
01:29:47.931 --> 01:29:51.081
<v Speaker 4>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're kind of like a new </v>

1977
01:29:51.081 --> 01:29:53.010
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess you feel like that it's timed.</v>

1978
01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:58.040
<v Speaker 4>I feel like this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You remember when we read about George </v>

1979
01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:58.040
<v Speaker 4>Washington having wooden teeth?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1980
01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:58.890
<v Speaker 4>I read about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that not true?</v>

1981
01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure he did the best they had,</v>

1982
01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:06.740
<v Speaker 4>but I think you hear about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you heard about a guy today that it </v>

1983
01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:06.740
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The book,</v>

1984
01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:07.140
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck get that kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dentist.</v>

1985
01:30:07.170 --> 01:30:09.030
<v Speaker 4>The fuck is he?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they have implants and give them real</v>

1986
01:30:09.031 --> 01:30:11.450
<v Speaker 4>teeth is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like</v>

1987
01:30:11.690 --> 01:30:14.960
<v Speaker 5>there is going to be a time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe not in our lifetimes,</v>

1988
01:30:14.961 --> 01:30:19.961
<v Speaker 5>but maybe shortly after where you know </v>
<v Speaker 5>they use crispr or some gene editing </v>

1989
01:30:21.381 --> 01:30:26.381
<v Speaker 5>materials,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that where they can </v>

1990
01:30:26.381 --> 01:30:26.381
<v Speaker 5>actually turn you into a.</v>

1991
01:30:26.381 --> 01:30:28.850
<v Speaker 4>Oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean once you go through puberty.</v>

1992
01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:29.720
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1993
01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:30.070
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1994
01:30:30.330 --> 01:30:33.810
<v Speaker 5>Can alter your jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look what what they can do now.</v>

1995
01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:38.840
<v Speaker 5>What mostly what they're doing now is </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're doing work with embryos and </v>

1996
01:30:38.911 --> 01:30:39.630
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1997
01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:42.540
<v Speaker 5>they're planning on altering people from</v>
<v Speaker 5>the jump,</v>

1998
01:30:42.541 --> 01:30:46.290
<v Speaker 5>like from the time they're born,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as that technology gets better,</v>

1999
01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:51.820
<v Speaker 5>more effective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to be able to utilize it </v>

2000
01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:54.201
<v Speaker 5>on regular people and they've actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>started introducing certain genes into </v>

2001
01:30:54.201 --> 01:30:58.131
<v Speaker 5>people that didn't have them before in </v>
<v Speaker 5>order to fix certain ailments or </v>

2002
01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:03.260
<v Speaker 5>alterations in jeans to like to try to </v>
<v Speaker 5>combat certain life threatening </v>

2003
01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:07.971
<v Speaker 5>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like all these things around the table </v>

2004
01:31:07.971 --> 01:31:09.951
<v Speaker 5>and I think it's just a matter of time </v>
<v Speaker 5>before they come up with the technology </v>

2005
01:31:09.951 --> 01:31:10.950
<v Speaker 5>that allows someone to completely alter </v>
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>

2006
01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:12.120
<v Speaker 5>their actual set.</v>

2007
01:31:12.410 --> 01:31:16.560
<v Speaker 4>Next.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have things that alter by myself.</v>

2008
01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:19.350
<v Speaker 4>What would you check it first?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be hot as fuck.</v>

01:33:57.230 --> 01:33:58.450
<v Speaker 1>pubic cared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vanished.</v>

2072
01:33:58.630 --> 01:34:03.630
<v Speaker 1>That's true bit my act about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the best sign of porns </v>

2073
01:34:03.630 --> 01:34:06.100
<v Speaker 1>influence in our culture is the absence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of pubic hair.</v>

2074
01:34:06.130 --> 01:34:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Like if you had a time machine and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get scientists from the future and </v>

2075
01:34:11.130 --> 01:34:12.940
<v Speaker 1>they're studying the time period between</v>
<v Speaker 1>1990 and 2018,</v>

2076
01:34:12.941 --> 01:34:17.941
<v Speaker 1>the most confusing thing would be what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to the pubic hair because </v>

2077
01:34:17.941 --> 01:34:18.730
<v Speaker 1>there's no historical record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody discussed it.</v>

2078
01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just started hacking off their </v>

2079
01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:25.711
<v Speaker 1>pubes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about the bald </v>

2080
01:34:25.711 --> 01:34:25.711
<v Speaker 1>situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's normal.</v>

2081
01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:27.730
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't bother me anymore,</v>

2082
01:34:27.731 --> 01:34:30.610
<v Speaker 1>but when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I was young,</v>

2083
01:34:30.611 --> 01:34:31.960
<v Speaker 1>nobody did anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Girls would.</v>

2084
01:34:32.050 --> 01:34:34.240
<v Speaker 1>It was chaos down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a disaster.</v>

2085
01:34:34.241 --> 01:34:39.241
<v Speaker 1>It was like he would touch their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you were going down on a girl </v>

2086
01:34:39.241 --> 01:34:41.470
<v Speaker 1>or you were fooling around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put your hand down her pants and you</v>

2087
01:34:41.471 --> 01:34:44.290
<v Speaker 1>feel it outside the underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like an afro in there.</v>

2088
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Like you had like a covering over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the forest buffer.</v>

2089
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2090
01:34:48.761 --> 01:34:53.761
<v Speaker 1>somebody threw like five haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody threw a parachute over tree </v>

2091
01:34:54.451 --> 01:34:56.980
<v Speaker 1>tops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just touch it.</v>

2142
01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:07.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crazy jungle asshole hair.</v>

2143
01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:13.240
<v Speaker 5>Definitely better to be a man in terms </v>
<v Speaker 5>of grooming shows 100 percent.</v>

2144
01:37:13.630 --> 01:37:14.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just,</v>

2145
01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.850
<v Speaker 5>you just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just to be clean.</v>

2146
01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:19.100
<v Speaker 5>If your wife said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not shaving anymore,</v>

2147
01:37:19.130 --> 01:37:21.950
<v Speaker 5>would you have the talk?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would you say whatever you want?</v>

2148
01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:23.270
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2149
01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:27.880
<v Speaker 5>I'd have to figure out a way to get her </v>
<v Speaker 5>to play with wax or something like that.</v>

2150
01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:32.890
<v Speaker 5>Just rip it all off though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go lasers play a game of laser tag and </v>

2151
01:37:32.890 --> 01:37:37.890
<v Speaker 5>people if you imagine if they had like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how they get rid of it,</v>

2152
01:37:40.971 --> 01:37:42.530
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's laser hair removal.</v>

2153
01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:47.740
<v Speaker 5>But imagine if there was like a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can just drive down the street and </v>

2154
01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:50.051
<v Speaker 5>shoot people's hair off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's assault those eyebrows </v>

2155
01:37:50.051 --> 01:37:52.670
<v Speaker 5>pop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems very dangerous.</v>

2156
01:37:52.730 --> 01:37:55.160
<v Speaker 5>Although it's shooting a laser beam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how you get lasik,</v>

2157
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:56.190
<v Speaker 5>which</v>

2158
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:58.170
<v Speaker 1>sounds insane to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how they do it?</v>

2159
01:37:58.230 --> 01:38:01.890
<v Speaker 1>So some of it is they do with a scalpel </v>
<v Speaker 1>and actual scalpel.</v>

2160
01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought they just burned her ibo,</v>

2161
01:38:03.281 --> 01:38:03.920
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them.</v>

2162
01:38:03.921 --> 01:38:06.840
<v Speaker 1>But I think some of them they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's two different ways to do</v>

2163
01:38:06.841 --> 01:38:11.841
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes they do it with an </v>

2164
01:38:11.841 --> 01:38:11.841
<v Speaker 1>actual scalpel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a blade.</v>

2165
01:38:11.841 --> 01:38:16.120
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they think that that's </v>

2166
01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:18.071
<v Speaker 1>more precise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they worried about </v>

2167
01:38:18.071 --> 01:38:18.620
<v Speaker 1>lesbians before lasik surgery was don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>look what a fucking laser beam.</v>

2168
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:22.310
<v Speaker 1>That was the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well here it goes.</v>

2169
01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Laser pointer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>burns hole.</v>

2172
01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:32.370

<v Speaker 1>eyeball.</v>

2173

2190
01:39:20.090 --> 01:39:23.750
<v Speaker 1>The doctors decided on a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach rather than surgery.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don'T have some day when you're 47,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really don't have some day because </v>

2239
01:41:26.670 --> 01:41:30.811
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about autism is a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it is age of the father.</v>

2240
01:41:31.930 --> 01:41:34.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the age of the mother is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the age of the father.</v>

2241
01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:37.220
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I've been in a coma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2242
01:41:37.221 --> 01:41:39.780
<v Speaker 1>disease where you fall asleep for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and you wake up.</v>

2243
01:41:39.850 --> 01:41:41.230
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2244
01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where those years went.</v>

2245
01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:46.250
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I woke up recently and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2246
01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:48.400
<v Speaker 1>well how am I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing now?</v>

2247
01:41:48.401 --> 01:41:53.401
<v Speaker 1>Do you think this is because you weren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing what you wanted to do because you </v>

2248
01:41:53.401 --> 01:41:57.640
<v Speaker 1>were just doing a bunch of other shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the years just kept piling up maybe.</v>

2249
01:41:57.730 --> 01:41:59.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you feel.</v>

2250
01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:02.800

<v Speaker 1>life a little easier.</v>

2251
01:42:02.801 --> 01:42:07.801
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because I didn't have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sort of seems like one chunk that </v>

2252
01:42:07.801 --> 01:42:08.350
<v Speaker 1>went by fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids,</v>

2253
01:42:08.351 --> 01:42:11.020
<v Speaker 1>you caN mark years with your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2254
01:42:11.250 --> 01:42:15.400
<v Speaker 1>the reality of being a person is if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>really do live to be 80,</v>

2255
01:42:15.401 --> 01:42:20.401
<v Speaker 1>9,100,</v>

2258
01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:30.700
<v Speaker 1>and then you don't have enough for </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner.</v>

2259
01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:33.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a dollar here,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you're going to keep growing.</v>

2298
01:44:16.661 --> 01:44:16.661
<v Speaker 5>There's no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2299
01:44:16.661 --> 01:44:17.960
<v Speaker 5>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking.</v>

2300
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:23.350
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have so many different avenues now </v>

2301
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:25.730
<v Speaker 5>that didn't exist before and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that I think is really cool about</v>

2302
01:44:25.731 --> 01:44:28.850
<v Speaker 5>today versus when I started,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2303
01:44:28.851 --> 01:44:31.700
<v Speaker 5>I started in 88,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that there's,</v>

2304
01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.820
<v Speaker 5>there's not like a competitiveness with </v>
<v Speaker 5>comedians.</v>

2305
01:44:34.821 --> 01:44:36.950
<v Speaker 5>Instead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's like a hyper supportiveness.</v>

2306
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:40.040
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's quick to tell you about </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are really good.</v>

2307
01:44:40.370 --> 01:44:45.200
<v Speaker 5>Everybody wants everybody to know this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>LIke there's no famine anymore because I</v>

2308
01:44:45.201 --> 01:44:50.201
<v Speaker 5>think before when there was only one </v>
<v Speaker 5>tonight show or a letterman and there </v>

2309
01:44:50.201 --> 01:44:51.530
<v Speaker 5>was a sitcom and everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 5>scrambling for,</v>

2310
01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:53.810
<v Speaker 5>you want to get thursday night at 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>on nbc.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's where the friends pot is like </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody wanted to get in the right </v>

2312
01:44:58.810 --> 01:44:59.600
<v Speaker 5>spot and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's not that anymore.</v>

2313
01:44:59.630 --> 01:45:01.910
<v Speaker 5>That's an interesting point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hadn't thought of that.</v>

2314
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:07.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's like everybody has a youtube </v>

<v Speaker 5>instagram thing or a podcast.</v>

2316
01:45:10.101 --> 01:45:15.101
<v Speaker 5>They're all doing their own thing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of being competitive with other </v>

<v Speaker 5>comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's like,</v>

01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:02.430
<v Speaker 1>thick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neck was thick,</v>

2592
01:58:02.431 --> 01:58:03.330

<v Speaker 1>You gotta fucking take that plunger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oops.</v>

2598
01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:24.531
<v Speaker 1>just was hyper aggressive virtue </v>
<v Speaker 1>signaling and really didn't even know </v>

2599
01:58:24.531 --> 01:58:27.570
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck he was talking about and </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly picked the wrong guy.</v>

2601
01:58:31.381 --> 01:58:36.381
<v Speaker 1>I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like the fact that he can't be </v>

2602
01:58:36.381 --> 01:58:38.691
<v Speaker 1>president really pisses me off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why can't I want a guy who's </v>

2603
01:58:38.691 --> 01:58:38.691
<v Speaker 1>smarter than me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2604
01:58:38.691 --> 01:58:41.160
<v Speaker 1>he could be president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think being an atheist.</v>

2605
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2606
01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:45.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did I get.</v>

2607
01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't get this whole thing of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>

2608
01:58:47.361 --> 01:58:49.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to vote for this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can relate to him.</v>

2609
01:58:49.391 --> 01:58:50.070
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mate,</v>

2610
01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:55.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't want a guy like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when a babysitter like I want </v>

2611
01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:57.130
<v Speaker 1>to babysit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want someone who's superior exactly.</v>

2612
01:58:57.131 --> 01:58:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come in.</v>

2613
01:58:59.230 --> 01:59:04.230
<v Speaker 1>He's very meditative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam and mom and I firmly believe no one </v>

2614
01:59:04.230 --> 01:59:05.470
<v Speaker 1>should be president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there should be a council.</v>

2615
01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise people.</v>

2616
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I love that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the jedi council fucking eight </v>

2617
01:59:12.510 --> 01:59:12.510
<v Speaker 1>people or something.</v>

2618
01:59:12.510 --> 01:59:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Just really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really smart people that have no idea </v>

2619
01:59:17.190 --> 01:59:17.590
<v Speaker 1>and I think they should all have had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do mushrooms.</v>

2620
01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:21.580
<v Speaker 1>All of them I think about that have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do psychedelic experiences.</v>

2621
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:23.370
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be high.</v>

2622
01:59:23.410 --> 01:59:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Can it not do mushrooms while they're on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the job,</v>

2623
01:59:26.171 --> 01:59:31.171
<v Speaker 1>but have in the past where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand there's more to life than </v>

2624
01:59:31.171 --> 01:59:31.480
<v Speaker 1>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the platform.</v>

2625
01:59:31.690 --> 01:59:34.570
<v Speaker 1>The person needs to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did try mushrooms,</v>

2626
01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:39.600
<v Speaker 1>didn't know you gotta go deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to take the heroic dose.</v>

2627
01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2628
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:42.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love that idea.</v>

2629
01:59:42.340 --> 01:59:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Like a little think tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2630
01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Eight people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super wise people.</v>

2631
01:59:45.790 --> 01:59:48.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think the mushroom thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is necessary but,</v>

2632
01:59:48.910 --> 01:59:53.910
<v Speaker 1>but consider it wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective people that care and have a </v>

2633
01:59:56.290 --> 02:00:01.290
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deep sense of responsibility to sort </v>

2634
02:00:02.081 --> 02:00:05.590
<v Speaker 1>of guide our country and the best way </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

2635
02:00:05.650 --> 02:00:07.270
<v Speaker 1>I probably done for their own interests.</v>

2636
02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put neil degrasse tyson on this.</v>

2637
02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sam harris to the way he argues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just stays calm.</v>

02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't argue about things he doesn't</v>

2670
02:01:33.641 --> 02:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>understand either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2671
02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>like if sam has a conversation and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say like he's</v>

2672
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:43.220
<v Speaker 5>having a conversation with someone about</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2673
02:01:43.850 --> 02:01:48.850
<v Speaker 5>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some discipline that's outside of his </v>

2674
02:01:48.850 --> 02:01:48.850
<v Speaker 5>realm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

2675
02:01:48.850 --> 02:01:48.850
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'll,</v>

2676
02:01:48.850 --> 02:01:49.800
<v Speaker 5>he'll ask questions like he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have,</v>

2677
02:01:49.850 --> 02:01:51.380
<v Speaker 5>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's not a know it all.</v>

2678
02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:53.240
<v Speaker 5>That's how you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will forget.</v>

2679
02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:56.030
<v Speaker 5>But if he's talking to you about </v>
<v Speaker 5>something and he's arguing,</v>

2680
02:01:56.031 --> 02:01:57.790
<v Speaker 5>it's because he understands what he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>

2681
02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:02.800
<v Speaker 5>But that's a rare quality man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so many people that want to </v>

2682
02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:02.840
<v Speaker 5>argue about shit that they really don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>even understand.</v>

2683
02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:05.240
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think there's anything wrong</v>

2684
02:02:05.241 --> 02:02:10.241
<v Speaker 5>with discussing things that you really </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't understand to try to understand </v>

2685
02:02:10.241 --> 02:02:13.061
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if you're doing it in a </v>

2686
02:02:13.061 --> 02:02:15.490
<v Speaker 5>casual conversation or even a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's a lot of fucking people that</v>

2687

<v Speaker 5>win,</v>

2688
02:02:18.410 --> 02:02:20.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just trying to score points.</v>

2689
02:02:21.170 --> 02:02:22.850
<v Speaker 5>They're not really talking right.</v>

2690
02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:24.140
<v Speaker 5>He got a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2691
02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:29.150
<v Speaker 5>I do it a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm more aware of it.</v>

2692
02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:31.100
<v Speaker 5>Watching people who were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who don't do it.</v>

2693
02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:34.400
<v Speaker 5>You learned a pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 5>normal tHing.</v>

2694
02:02:34.401 --> 02:02:37.790

<v Speaker 5>you want your idea to be right.</v>

2695

<v Speaker 5>know exactly what happened.</v>

2699
02:02:48.211 --> 02:02:53.211
<v Speaker 5>DO you see these groups of people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>automatically want to think that person </v>

2700
02:02:53.211 --> 02:02:56.090
<v Speaker 5>is guilty and automatically have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>preconceived idea of what went down,</v>

2701
02:02:56.091 --> 02:03:01.091
<v Speaker 5>how it went down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>regardless of what the other person </v>

<v Speaker 5>It's just a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But my genius came up with it not be a </v>

2728
02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:11.600
<v Speaker 5>bad theory mean what a roll of the dice,</v>

<v Speaker 1>moment of panic after I'm done.</v>

<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2915
02:12:24.970 --> 02:12:26.940
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I'd thought of that now.</v>

2916
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.880
<v Speaker 1>And you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

2917
02:12:27.881 --> 02:12:29.680
<v Speaker 1>that's the angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>

2918
02:12:30.050 --> 02:12:31.890
<v Speaker 5>well I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I came,</v>

2919
02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:36.920
<v Speaker 5>I had to think for so long how to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that and the way to it was just to shit </v>

2920
02:12:37.771 --> 02:12:42.771
<v Speaker 5>on myself first and then also have a lot</v>
<v Speaker 5>of truth in it about how like I've never</v>

2921
02:12:42.841 --> 02:12:43.740
<v Speaker 5>been happier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm,</v>

2922
02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:46.620
<v Speaker 5>I've never been more of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I live in a house filled With girls.</v>

2923
02:12:46.621 --> 02:12:48.000
<v Speaker 5>There was all women in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2924
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:53.390
<v Speaker 5>I have zero say in like where things go </v>
<v Speaker 5>or what color things are.</v>

2925
02:12:53.761 --> 02:12:55.830
<v Speaker 5>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's easier to,</v>

2926
02:12:55.860 --> 02:12:59.280
<v Speaker 5>to just let them run out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want them to be happy and I don't need</v>

2927
02:12:59.281 --> 02:13:04.281
<v Speaker 5>my masculine energy everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's also one of the nice things </v>

2928
02:13:04.281 --> 02:13:07.911
<v Speaker 5>about this place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This place is clearly like a big oldest </v>

2929
02:13:07.911 --> 02:13:08.010
<v Speaker 5>is a bro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bro.</v>

2930
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:10.590
<v Speaker 5>It's a fucking bro warehouse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

2931
02:13:10.740 --> 02:13:12.420
<v Speaker 5>so I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've felt like,</v>

2932
02:13:12.450 --> 02:13:14.760
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing because they're turning</v>

2933
02:13:14.761 --> 02:13:16.830
<v Speaker 5>me softer for sure.</v>

2934
02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:21.860
<v Speaker 5>Like women living with all these women </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I've changed the way I communicate </v>

2935
02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:23.940
<v Speaker 5>and think and behave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm turning into a bitch.</v>

2936
02:13:24.210 --> 02:13:29.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never been more of a bitch in my </v>

2937
02:13:29.210 --> 02:13:29.210
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the idea was like if my,</v>

2938
02:13:29.210 --> 02:13:32.000
<v Speaker 5>my manhood was a mountain of marbles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like every day they take just like,</v>

2939
02:13:32.670 --> 02:13:34.440
<v Speaker 5>what's the big deal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have So many marbles,</v>

2940
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:35.400
<v Speaker 5>god,</v>

2941
02:13:35.730 --> 02:13:37.380

<v Speaker 5>Why do you even care?</v>

2942
02:13:37.530 --> 02:13:38.420
<v Speaker 5>And then I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2943
02:13:38.421 --> 02:13:40.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm seeing where this is going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I,</v>

2944
02:13:41.010 --> 02:13:42.270
<v Speaker 5>then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2945
02:13:42.450 --> 02:13:44.460
<v Speaker 5>this is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where the bit is.</v>

2946
02:13:44.461 --> 02:13:47.340
<v Speaker 5>The bit is I'm not going out like bruce </v>
<v Speaker 5>jenner.</v>

2947
02:13:47.870 --> 02:13:49.770
<v Speaker 5>And then unlike like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's like,</v>

2948
02:13:49.771 --> 02:13:51.180
<v Speaker 5>he's always been a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like maybe,</v>

2949
02:13:51.570 --> 02:13:56.570
<v Speaker 5>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or maybe if you live with crazy bitches </v>

2950
02:13:56.570 --> 02:13:57.150
<v Speaker 5>long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you fucking become one.</v>

2951
02:13:57.420 --> 02:13:59.940
<v Speaker 5>Like kanye.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't like what you're saying.</v>

2952
02:13:59.970 --> 02:14:02.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't like what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's going crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He's clearly going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You live with crazy people.</v>

2954
02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:08.960
<v Speaker 5>It's entirely so that bit was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ones where after I released it like,</v>

2955
02:14:09.070 --> 02:14:10.170
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that poor girl,</v>

2956
02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:15.240
<v Speaker 5>she doesn't need me to be pretending </v>
<v Speaker 5>that she gets reduced by demons in the </v>

2957
02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:15.240
<v Speaker 5>middle of the night while she's </v>
<v Speaker 5>sleeping.</v>

2958
02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:23.070
<v Speaker 5>BuT it was so fun to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was also a fucked up it to do because</v>

2959
02:14:23.071 --> 02:14:26.100
<v Speaker 5>in order to do it I literally had to </v>
<v Speaker 5>think like a demon.</v>

2960
02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:31.520
<v Speaker 5>Like I would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would think like I was trying to </v>

2961
02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:31.520
<v Speaker 5>seduce her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It goes,</v>

2962
02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:31.770
<v Speaker 5>it goes like whispered in her ear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a demon.</v>

2963
02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:36.920
<v Speaker 5>Like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no effect on the one of us.</v>

2964
02:14:42.270 --> 02:14:43.870
<v Speaker 5>You can just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2965
02:14:44.610 --> 02:14:47.790
<v Speaker 5>that's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can I can't be one of you?</v>

02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:51.620
<v Speaker 5>What was born a man?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see the license old,</v>

2967
02:14:51.770 --> 02:14:56.120
<v Speaker 5>like a footage of the old kardashians </v>
<v Speaker 5>shows and bruce will come in like,</v>

2968

2970
02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:06.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Since he was younger.</v>

2971
02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:12.260
<v Speaker 5>You know what the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a theory by one of the guys who </v>

2972
02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:12.260
<v Speaker 5>was In the olympics with them that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2973
02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:12.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had,</v>

2974
02:15:12.330 --> 02:15:14.400
<v Speaker 5>everybody was writing it up back then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody,</v>

2975
02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:16.860

<v Speaker 5>they just gave everybody steroids.</v>

2976
02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:22.160
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things that happens to </v>
<v Speaker 5>men when they take large doses of </v>

2977
02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:23.700
<v Speaker 5>steroids is that your testosterone shuts</v>
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>

2978
02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:26.930
<v Speaker 5>Your body just shuts down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2979
02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.690
<v Speaker 5>And there's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a depression period.</v>

2980
02:15:30.750 --> 02:15:34.260
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of weird things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>happen to men.</v>

2981
02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:39.320
<v Speaker 5>One of the other things that happens is </v>
<v Speaker 5>your body starts producing way more </v>

2982
02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:39.930
<v Speaker 5>estrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get something called bitch tits.</v>

2983
02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:42.010
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I received that dose.</v>

2984
02:15:42.110 --> 02:15:43.140
<v Speaker 5>Got no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's different.</v>

2985
02:15:43.470 --> 02:15:48.470
<v Speaker 5>It's called gynecoMastia and </v>
<v Speaker 5>gynecomastia comes from in introducing </v>

2986
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:50.400
<v Speaker 5>too much exogenous testosterone into </v>
<v Speaker 5>your system.</v>

2987
02:15:50.401 --> 02:15:53.370
<v Speaker 5>Your body starts producing estrogen to </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of balance it out.</v>

2988
02:15:53.670 --> 02:15:56.490
<v Speaker 5>And in that process you grow tits </v>
<v Speaker 5>literally.</v>

2989
02:15:56.540 --> 02:15:58.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what this person from the.</v>

2990
02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:01.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember if they named the </v>
<v Speaker 5>person who it was,</v>

2991
02:16:01.501 --> 02:16:06.501
<v Speaker 5>but they were saying that all of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened right when bruce got off </v>

2992
02:16:06.501 --> 02:16:07.710
<v Speaker 5>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like right after the olympics,</v>

2993
02:16:07.711 --> 02:16:12.711
<v Speaker 5>like you saw these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this transition taking place where he </v>

2994
02:16:12.711 --> 02:16:14.280
<v Speaker 5>was just baffled and confused.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard that when he was a kid,</v>

2995
02:16:14.281 --> 02:16:17.050
<v Speaker 5>he used to steal his mom's or his </v>
<v Speaker 5>sister's clothes or something like that.</v>

2996
02:16:17.150 --> 02:16:18.470
<v Speaker 5>I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know my brain.</v>

2997
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:20.830
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That makes more sense.</v>

2998
02:16:20.910 --> 02:16:22.440
<v Speaker 5>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like these.</v>

2999
02:16:22.690 --> 02:16:27.690
<v Speaker 5>She's tortured and that must be awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really like really feel comfortable </v>

3000
02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:30.310
<v Speaker 5>like making.</v>

3001
02:16:30.690 --> 02:16:35.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't make fun of like her ed taylor </v>
<v Speaker 4>or something like she's really a </v>

3002
02:16:35.690 --> 02:16:39.031
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like besides the forgetting the </v>

3003
02:16:39.031 --> 02:16:39.220
<v Speaker 4>transgender thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like she's really funny.</v>

3004
02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:44.400
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about the fucking killed the lady </v>

3005
02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:44.400
<v Speaker 4>and never bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just that alone that yeah,</v>

3006
02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:45.190
<v Speaker 4>that is a.</v>

3007
02:16:46.030 --> 02:16:48.100
<v Speaker 5>I mean all of the conversations </v>
<v Speaker 5>afterwards,</v>

3008
02:16:48.101 --> 02:16:53.101
<v Speaker 5>all the interviews afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't this existential crisis of </v>

3009
02:16:53.101 --> 02:16:56.641
<v Speaker 5>having accidentally killed someone and </v>
<v Speaker 5>being at this point in your life where </v>

3010
02:16:56.641 --> 02:16:56.641
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my god,</v>

3011
02:16:56.641 --> 02:17:00.810
<v Speaker 5>I don't have much time to live,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I just sent some woman to her grave </v>

3012
02:17:00.810 --> 02:17:00.810
<v Speaker 5>because I wasn't paying attention at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>wheel.</v>

3013
02:17:00.810 --> 02:17:02.140
<v Speaker 5>My escalate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That never got brought up.</v>

3014
02:17:02.190 --> 02:17:02.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

3015
02:17:02.911 --> 02:17:05.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't know like what she felt behind </v>
<v Speaker 4>closed doors,</v>

3016
02:17:05.281 --> 02:17:07.460
<v Speaker 4>but it didn't seem like it slowed her </v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

3017
02:17:08.850 --> 02:17:10.560
<v Speaker 4>I think I'd take a month off and be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3018
02:17:10.590 --> 02:17:15.540
<v Speaker 4>I got to like not be out in public and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel horrible and I'm going to take care</v>

3019
02:17:15.541 --> 02:17:19.240
<v Speaker 4>of this for a different eye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shades care.</v>

3020
02:17:19.260 --> 02:17:24.260
<v Speaker 4>She wants to even famous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know how that cracked out and </v>

3021
02:17:24.260 --> 02:17:24.260
<v Speaker 4>talk about that.</v>

3022
02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:32.800
<v Speaker 5>You're so good at that impression.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could do her onstage and you don't </v>

3023
02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:35.220
<v Speaker 5>even need like the face swap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like people would just start laughing</v>

3024
02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:40.990
<v Speaker 4>do and I did at largo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got fully dressed up and I put like </v>

3025
02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:44.170
<v Speaker 4>glasses on it back and introduce you as </v>
<v Speaker 4>caitlyn jenner.</v>

3026
02:17:46.461 --> 02:17:46.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3027
02:17:46.850 --> 02:17:50.000
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came out as like it was a big risk and</v>

3028
02:17:50.270 --> 02:17:52.200
<v Speaker 4>zach galifianakis is backstage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3029
02:17:52.410 --> 02:17:54.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what was going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was like,</v>

3030
02:17:54.111 --> 02:17:55.500
<v Speaker 4>I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've dressed up as woman.</v>

3031
02:17:55.501 --> 02:17:59.120
<v Speaker 4>Then I'll just say this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a longer fall when it fails,</v>

3032
02:17:59.270 --> 02:18:04.270
<v Speaker 4>which is true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you get all dressed up and you </v>

3033
02:18:04.270 --> 02:18:04.270
<v Speaker 4>bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like</v>

3034
02:18:05.150 --> 02:18:07.640
<v Speaker 5>dark scared me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Darkness,</v>

3035
02:18:07.670 --> 02:18:12.670
<v Speaker 5>darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lucky that she's ridiculous enough that </v>

3036
02:18:12.670 --> 02:18:17.531
<v Speaker 5>you could point things out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this is one of the things that </v>

3037
02:18:17.531 --> 02:18:20.241
<v Speaker 5>people always say about you don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When people were clamoring about what a </v>

3038
02:18:20.241 --> 02:18:20.241
<v Speaker 5>great person hillary clinton was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3039
02:18:20.330 --> 02:18:24.020
<v Speaker 5>do you know that she didn't endorse gay </v>
<v Speaker 5>marriage until 2013?</v>

3040
02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:28.550
<v Speaker 5>She was against know that against gay </v>
<v Speaker 5>marriage until 2013.</v>

3041
02:18:28.850 --> 02:18:33.850
<v Speaker 5>She's a fucking ridiculous person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's hundreds of videos of her lying </v>

3042
02:18:34.010 --> 02:18:34.820
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What she said,</v>

3043
02:18:34.821 --> 02:18:36.120
<v Speaker 5>and you hear what the truth is right </v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

3044
02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:40.040
<v Speaker 5>Like the comey investigation with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fbi found that deleted emails.</v>

3045
02:18:40.430 --> 02:18:41.680
<v Speaker 5>Ben gazi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she says,</v>

3046
02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.140
<v Speaker 5>just not an honest person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that's part of the job.</v>

3047
02:18:45.290 --> 02:18:47.450
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that,</v>

3048
02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:50.690
<v Speaker 5>that if you bring that up to people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have less of an argument.</v>

3049
02:18:50.691 --> 02:18:51.560
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with caitlin,</v>

3050
02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:55.940
<v Speaker 5>I'll bring up the fact that she's </v>
<v Speaker 5>against gay marriage and people go,</v>

3051
02:18:55.941 --> 02:18:56.810
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

3052
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:58.310
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you serious?</v>

3053
02:18:58.490 --> 02:18:58.840
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3054
02:18:58.841 --> 02:18:59.290
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3055
02:18:59.310 --> 02:19:01.100
<v Speaker 5>Here I'm going to play something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you play.</v>

3056
02:19:01.101 --> 02:19:01.590
<v Speaker 5>You're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

3057
02:19:01.591 --> 02:19:02.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm but traditional girl.</v>

3058
02:19:03.650 --> 02:19:06.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>

3059
02:19:06.631 --> 02:19:10.980
<v Speaker 4>So mind blowing that it went over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You almost can't.</v>

3060
02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:14.040
<v Speaker 4>I can't even wrap my head around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's got to be a joke.</v>

3061
02:19:14.041 --> 02:19:14.660
<v Speaker 4>I can't</v>

3062
02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:17.940
<v Speaker 5>can that much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They seem to be like letting that slide,</v>

3063
02:19:18.350 --> 02:19:21.880
<v Speaker 5>but they don't see how fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous that is.</v>

3064
02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:24.160
<v Speaker 5>Very hypocritical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just crazy.</v>

3065
02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:29.030
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like mentally unstable.</v>

3066
02:19:29.050 --> 02:19:32.240
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's bad processing going on,</v>

3067
02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:35.800
<v Speaker 4>abs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's no sense or or empathy to</v>

3068
02:19:35.980 --> 02:19:38.460
<v Speaker 4>put that on this screen right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>

3069
02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:39.070
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

3070
02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:39.780
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

3071
02:19:39.850 --> 02:19:44.020
<v Speaker 5>The thing about gay marriage to me has </v>
<v Speaker 5>always been who gives a fuck,</v>

3072
02:19:44.050 --> 02:19:49.050
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are we pretending that they don't love </v>

3073
02:19:49.050 --> 02:19:49.050
<v Speaker 5>each other?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what are we doing?</v>

3074
02:19:49.050 --> 02:19:49.360
<v Speaker 5>Are we pretending that it's immoral?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3075
02:19:49.361 --> 02:19:51.070
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a moral thing.</v>

3076
02:19:51.310 --> 02:19:52.990
<v Speaker 5>Then we have a real argument,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

3077
02:19:52.991 --> 02:19:57.991
<v Speaker 5>like what is morality?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's not two people that love each </v>

3078
02:19:57.991 --> 02:20:00.721
<v Speaker 5>other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a problem with the fact that </v>

3079
02:20:00.721 --> 02:20:02.210
<v Speaker 5>they're both boys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've done scientific studies that </v>

3080
02:20:02.210 --> 02:20:04.720
<v Speaker 5>have shown that there's different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have a different pattern to the way</v>

3081
02:20:04.721 --> 02:20:06.120
<v Speaker 5>their brain thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3082
02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:08.080
<v Speaker 5>I mean they can show the difference in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the way,</v>

3083
02:20:08.081 --> 02:20:12.240
<v Speaker 5>especially with trans kids and trans </v>
<v Speaker 5>people there.</v>

3084
02:20:12.310 --> 02:20:16.660
<v Speaker 5>There are showing with mris and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these different ways of measuring,</v>

3085
02:20:16.661 --> 02:20:21.661
<v Speaker 5>like their brains appear to work more </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a woman's brain and they do like a </v>

3086
02:20:21.661 --> 02:20:21.661
<v Speaker 5>man's brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's,</v>

3087
02:20:21.661 --> 02:20:26.310
<v Speaker 5>there's something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not as simple as delusions and then</v>

3088
02:20:26.311 --> 02:20:31.311
<v Speaker 5>with gay people there's clearly </v>
<v Speaker 5>something going on where they're </v>

3089
02:20:31.321 --> 02:20:36.321
<v Speaker 5>attracted only to the same sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a biological issue and this </v>

3090
02:20:36.331 --> 02:20:41.331
<v Speaker 5>issue is it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So to pretend that they're supposed to </v>

3091
02:20:41.331 --> 02:20:42.690
<v Speaker 5>ignore that for your benefit.</v>

3092
02:20:42.750 --> 02:20:43.740
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Todd,</v>

3093
02:20:43.770 --> 02:20:44.870
<v Speaker 4>you know todd glass?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

3094
02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:48.870
<v Speaker 4>You brought up a great are insightful </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing because he lived a lot.</v>

3095
02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:53.900
<v Speaker 4>People didn't know he was gay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he heard guys talking or people who </v>

3096
02:20:53.900 --> 02:20:57.081
<v Speaker 4>are like homophobic or whatever and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>point of view is like he thinks a lot of</v>

3097
02:20:58.321 --> 02:21:01.830
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of this is from people imagine the</v>

3098
02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:06.920
<v Speaker 4>act and they're grossed out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really bothers them and he was </v>

3099
02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:10.821
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you want to imagine your sister </v>

3100
02:21:10.821 --> 02:21:10.821
<v Speaker 4>giving a blow job?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3101
02:21:10.821 --> 02:21:15.080
<v Speaker 4>it's disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you want her to feel loved and you </v>

3102
02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:16.170
<v Speaker 4>want her to have that happiness and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all he was asking for.</v>

3103
02:21:16.180 --> 02:21:18.240
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was insightful thing.</v>

3104
02:21:18.350 --> 02:21:22.460
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of times too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just lack of exposure to gay people</v>

3105
02:21:22.490 --> 02:21:24.950
<v Speaker 5>when you're young in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3106
02:21:25.890 --> 02:21:30.890
<v Speaker 5>being or having them be accepted by your</v>
<v Speaker 5>family and other people and like what if</v>

3107
02:21:31.581 --> 02:21:32.960
<v Speaker 5>you were around?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I was a kid,</v>

3108
02:21:32.961 --> 02:21:35.510
<v Speaker 5>I got really lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lived in san francisco from the time I</v>

3109
02:21:35.511 --> 02:21:38.810
<v Speaker 5>was seven to 11 and we were on a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>gay people.</v>

3110
02:21:38.811 --> 02:21:43.811
<v Speaker 5>My next door neighborS were gay and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>would get naked with my aunt and it </v>

3111
02:21:43.811 --> 02:21:43.811
<v Speaker 5>would play the bongos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would smoke pot,</v>

3112
02:21:43.811 --> 02:21:46.850
<v Speaker 5>play the bongos because it was san </v>
<v Speaker 5>francisco or in the seventies.</v>

3113
02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:50.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to me gay people were just like,</v>

3114
02:21:50.660 --> 02:21:52.340
<v Speaker 5>it was a normal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just,</v>

3115
02:21:52.440 --> 02:21:54.680
<v Speaker 5>this guy is gay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy is black,</v>

3116
02:21:54.681 --> 02:21:57.320
<v Speaker 5>this guy is old disco.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a person.</v>

3117
02:21:57.321 --> 02:21:59.570
<v Speaker 5>Just different kind of person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I moved to Florida.</v>

3118
02:22:00.450 --> 02:22:02.450
<v Speaker 5>Well when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was 11,</v>

3119
02:22:02.451 --> 02:22:04.240
<v Speaker 5>we moved to Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We moved to gains,</v>

3120
02:22:04.250 --> 02:22:09.250
<v Speaker 5>basically moved to a different country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I moved to planet stupid and these </v>

3121
02:22:09.250 --> 02:22:11.200
<v Speaker 5>people that I lived,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had my friend,</v>

3122
02:22:11.290 --> 02:22:16.290
<v Speaker 5>his name was candy candido and he was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>cuban kid and his dad was fucking super </v>

3123
02:22:17.351 --> 02:22:20.290
<v Speaker 5>homophobic and so I remember I went over</v>
<v Speaker 5>his house,</v>

3124
02:22:20.291 --> 02:22:22.480
<v Speaker 5>wants after school to play and his dad </v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

3125
02:22:22.481 --> 02:22:25.300
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe these fucking faggots </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to get married,</v>

3126
02:22:25.740 --> 02:22:26.000
<v Speaker 5>believe</v>

3127
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:31.010
<v Speaker 1>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's throwing the newspaper down on </v>

3128
02:22:31.010 --> 02:22:31.010
<v Speaker 1>a table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I was,</v>

3129
02:22:31.010 --> 02:22:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I was 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3130
02:22:32.071 --> 02:22:34.800
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with this fucking dummy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does he care?</v>

3131
02:22:35.070 --> 02:22:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is this bothering him at all?</v>

3132
02:22:36.751 --> 02:22:39.000
<v Speaker 1>It didn't even make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3133
02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:44.400
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people real rage </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath it all,</v>

3134
02:22:44.401 --> 02:22:49.401
<v Speaker 1>which I think they're scared of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay and I don't want anybody to think </v>

3135
02:22:49.401 --> 02:22:49.401
<v Speaker 1>they're gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

3136
02:22:49.401 --> 02:22:52.590
<v Speaker 1>it's just just putting it off and it may</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like the act.</v>

3137
02:22:52.620 --> 02:22:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Discuss them like the all sex is </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting and the all of it.</v>

3138
02:22:56.010 --> 02:22:57.450
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

<v Speaker 1>tees.</v>
