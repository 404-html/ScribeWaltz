8
00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>I listen to Jimi Hendrix at least once a week for the longest time when I would</v>

9
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:26.550

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it the same way he was arrested in Toronto,</v>

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.903
<v Speaker 1>same photo.</v>

25
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.200
<v Speaker 1>It's just a bunch of images of it is the hardest.</v>

26
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.413
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

27
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.313
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

29
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>we've had some pretty epic podcast for 10 might have the most efficacy.</v>

30
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.791
<v Speaker 1>Cool man.</v>

31
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:48.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I think we've covered a lot.</v>

35
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 1>I had the right mixture of Alpha brain pills,</v>

36
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>

37
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>alcohol and coffee.</v>

38
00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.263
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>

39
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 1>We should add some vitamins.</v>

41
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>We didn't take it to the next level.</v>

42
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Here's a few times we were searching for words if we have the vitamins.</v>

43
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.473
<v Speaker 1>Nailed it.</v>

45
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.310
<v Speaker 1>How old was he?</v>

46
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.143
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

47
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 1>he died when he was 27 what year?</v>

48
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>That was 64 I think he died in 63 seeing that this is may one was with 69</v>

49
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Woodstock was 69 oh,</v>

50
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:23.840
<v Speaker 1>it says may 60 votes.</v>

51
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a four so [inaudible] 69</v>

52
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.633
<v Speaker 1>I think it died.</v>

53
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Not that much longer afterwards.</v>

54
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.123
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

55
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Shogun on his own farm it like like a champ,</v>

56
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.213
<v Speaker 1>like a champ.</v>

57
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.620
<v Speaker 1>You saw late night.</v>

58
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Podcasts are fucking hit or miss.</v>

59
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they work,</v>

60
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:47.634
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they don't.</v>

61
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

62
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.460
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

63
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a different vibe and sometimes people are tired and I've worked out,</v>

64
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.280
<v Speaker 1>worked in quotes.</v>

65
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.163
<v Speaker 1>It's not really work,</v>

66
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>but I was out in the sun all day and you know,</v>

67
00:02:57.301 --> 00:02:58.380
<v Speaker 1>you get a little,</v>

68
00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>a little tired,</v>

69
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:00.454
<v Speaker 1>loopy,</v>

70
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.870
<v Speaker 2>but you might have a weird fucking report.</v>

71
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

72
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 2>when we do podcasts,</v>

73
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 2>they get very strange.</v>

74
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not just the podcast,</v>

75
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.010
<v Speaker 1>every conversation.</v>

76
00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

77
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

78
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 2>we have gets weird.</v>

79
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

80
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 2>We both go to places where we wouldn't necessarily go without each other.</v>

81
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

82
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 2>we might,</v>

83
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

84
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 2>but I find myself there way more often with you and super comfortable with it,</v>

85
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:25.140
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

87
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

88
00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:25.651
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

89
00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:28.680
<v Speaker 1>we definitely like have an awesome cenergy man.</v>

90
00:03:28.681 --> 00:03:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I just got to get a fucking flotation tank.</v>

91
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about starting a Kickstarter</v>

92
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 2>going down the field lab or go into,</v>

93
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.380
<v Speaker 2>how far are you away from Burbank?</v>

94
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.130
<v Speaker 2>I could do that,</v>

95
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 2>but I've got this garage that she's dying for a flood.</v>

96
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.090
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

97
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.850
<v Speaker 2>any time you have some time off during the day,</v>

98
00:03:47.851 --> 00:03:49.020
<v Speaker 2>you're more than welcome to come here.</v>

99
00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:49.700
<v Speaker 2>And he's cool.</v>

100
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.533
<v Speaker 2>Anytime,</v>

101
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

102
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.133
<v Speaker 2>just come on over,</v>

103
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.130
<v Speaker 2>come on over and use it.</v>

104
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.330
<v Speaker 2>How often do you use it?</v>

105
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.040
<v Speaker 2>All the time.</v>

106
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.830
<v Speaker 2>Every day.</v>

107
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

108
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.791
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

109
00:03:56.791 --> 00:03:57.960
<v Speaker 2>I believe in taking days off.</v>

110
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

111
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.470
<v Speaker 2>I think you can get too addicted to the experience.</v>

112
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.800
<v Speaker 2>So it's a freaky experience.</v>

113
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:02.850
<v Speaker 2>And I know I'm not,</v>

114
00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:03.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say too addicted,</v>

115
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.950
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

116
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.370
<v Speaker 2>I like going in there,</v>

117
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.540
<v Speaker 2>absorbing something,</v>

118
00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:11.810
<v Speaker 2>coming out and then sort of applying that to my life.</v>

119
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.510
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I think about psychedelic trips,</v>

120
00:04:14.511 --> 00:04:15.530
<v Speaker 2>about meditation,</v>

121
00:04:15.531 --> 00:04:17.480
<v Speaker 2>about times at a tank,</v>

122
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.280
<v Speaker 2>which I think I find to be different than meditation and different from</v>

123
00:04:22.281 --> 00:04:24.740
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic trips and sort of a combination of the two,</v>

124
00:04:24.741 --> 00:04:26.390
<v Speaker 2>especially when I go in there and eat pot,</v>

125
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 2>which is how I usually do it.</v>

126
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

127
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.030
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty intense,</v>

128
00:04:29.031 --> 00:04:31.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's not quite a psychedelic experience,</v>

129
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.490
<v Speaker 2>the regular sentence because of good part of the,</v>

130
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.150
<v Speaker 2>the visual stimuli and the effects that I'm getting.</v>

131
00:04:38.151 --> 00:04:41.180
<v Speaker 2>It's because I'm floating and fucking warm salt water,</v>

132
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.670
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

133
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.690
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like I'm flying through space and I have no sensory input going in.</v>

134
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.541
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

135
00:04:45.541 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird combination between the two things we should,</v>

136
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.340
<v Speaker 2>meditation and psychedelic experience.</v>

137
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:50.031
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

138
00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:50.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

139
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.630
<v Speaker 2>I think in one of the most important parts about any of that stuff,</v>

140
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.920
<v Speaker 2>when your experiment experimenting with consciousness or pushing the boundaries</v>

141
00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.360
<v Speaker 2>of thinking ideas,</v>

142
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.770
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be a little applied.</v>

143
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.570
<v Speaker 2>You can't be a cripple in this world.</v>

144
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.291
<v Speaker 2>A mental cripple.</v>

145
00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:03.830
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

146
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.460
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

147
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

148
00:05:04.881 --> 00:05:08.680
<v Speaker 2>just only want to get high or just only one to escape are all there and</v>

149
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.440
<v Speaker 2>meditate.</v>

150
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.650
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

151
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 2>why would my instinct when I see like monks is to Meijer their virtue and</v>

152
00:05:14.691 --> 00:05:15.620
<v Speaker 2>admired their,</v>

153
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.820
<v Speaker 2>their discipline,</v>

154
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.990
<v Speaker 2>but also some time to be,</v>

155
00:05:17.991 --> 00:05:19.580
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting any policy.</v>

156
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.880
<v Speaker 1>You're not having sex,</v>

157
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.050
<v Speaker 1>you're not having fun.</v>

158
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.780
<v Speaker 1>You don't listen to good music up there,</v>

159
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:25.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>party and you'll never get a little too drunk.</v>

161
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 1>You never really eat a little too much food.</v>

162
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

163
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:31.580
<v Speaker 1>you don't ever go to see a moat.</v>

164
00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 1>May Laugh,</v>

165
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.640
<v Speaker 1>laugh photo too loud.</v>

166
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

167
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:35.140
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

168
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>You're missing,</v>

169
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>you're missing a big thing.</v>

170
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>I understand that it's difficult to manage this experience,</v>

171
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 1>but don't tell me you got it right with this minimalist approach because that's</v>

172
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

173
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.710
<v Speaker 1>No one's got it.</v>

174
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

175
00:05:45.891 --> 00:05:47.120
<v Speaker 1>but maybe me and I'm not you.</v>

176
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Can I play devil's advocate?</v>

177
00:05:48.321 --> 00:05:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Can I play monkeys?</v>

178
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Advocate?</v>

179
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

180
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they look at us the same way cause they plugged in to sometimes a million</v>

181
00:05:55.341 --> 00:05:58.240
<v Speaker 1>times better than music or blocking.</v>

182
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they've plugged into something bigger.</v>

183
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.153
<v Speaker 1>You're right navy.</v>

184
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not though.</v>

185
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the most scared pusses wearing orange robes and they don't get that.</v>

186
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 1>They don't even have cars.</v>

187
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.410
<v Speaker 1>They never gotten a fucking Shelby gt 500 and heard that fucking engine grouth</v>

188
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>that four inch pipe</v>

189
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 1>hit that first gear and fucking went sideways</v>

190
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.800

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 2>They've invented all that shit to make life more awesome.</v>

194
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Give blow blowjobs from other monks may be,</v>

195
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.280
<v Speaker 2>do you really want that?</v>

196
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

197
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Do you want a monk?</v>

198
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Blowjobs brown</v>

199
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.390

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Enough.</v>

201
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for everything.</v>

202
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.770
<v Speaker 2>See Son party rolls on.</v>

203
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

204
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.470
<v Speaker 2>When I'm on the road I get jet lag.</v>

205
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:53.300
<v Speaker 2>I take them the great for hangovers too.</v>

206
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

207
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand the science behind it.</v>

208
00:06:55.671 --> 00:06:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Don't give it was raving about,</v>

209
00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Speaker 2>and I guess you gave him some last time he did it.</v>

210
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.070
<v Speaker 2>People are gonna think that this is some sort of a,</v>

211
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

212
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.030
<v Speaker 2>a big,</v>

213
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

214
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.490
<v Speaker 2>commercial push.</v>

215
00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:08.510
<v Speaker 2>Like those some reason while we're talking about this other than the fact that</v>

216
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.790
<v Speaker 2>it really works cause I,</v>

217
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 2>the problem is I have a financial interest of this company so people think that</v>

218
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:16.011
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

219
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:16.844
<v Speaker 2>of course I'm just,</v>

220
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.850
<v Speaker 3>when you hired Tim Ferriss,</v>

221
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.693
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

222
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.430
<v Speaker 3>Hired</v>

223
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.260
<v Speaker 2>at the author Tim Ferriss to come in,</v>

224
00:07:22.261 --> 00:07:23.220
<v Speaker 2>cause I showed it to him.</v>

225
00:07:23.221 --> 00:07:23.461
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

226
00:07:23.461 --> 00:07:24.450
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about the ingredients?</v>

227
00:07:24.451 --> 00:07:25.830
<v Speaker 2>This thing he said he thought it was great.</v>

228
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.990
<v Speaker 2>So it was a perfect combination and then he took it,</v>

229
00:07:27.991 --> 00:07:29.610
<v Speaker 2>he tried it and he liked it and people,</v>

230
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.860
<v Speaker 2>there's some idiots on my message board that were accusing me of hiring him and</v>

231
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:33.150
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

232
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.290
<v Speaker 2>even if you're just joking,</v>

233
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.300
<v Speaker 2>it's so annoying.</v>

234
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Like stop.</v>

235
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.350
<v Speaker 2>She says Brandon.</v>

236
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.990
<v Speaker 2>So pretty quickly you uh,</v>

237
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.261
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

238
00:07:43.261 --> 00:07:44.880
<v Speaker 2>You feel pretty quick with that couple of days.</v>

239
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.410
<v Speaker 2>1515.</v>

240
00:07:46.411 --> 00:07:47.071
<v Speaker 2>Oh this is here,</v>

241
00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:47.904
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

242
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.180
<v Speaker 2>He felt it too.</v>

243
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Tim Ferriss,</v>

244
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.340
<v Speaker 2>he felt it right away.</v>

245
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I feel it right away.</v>

246
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.031
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

247
00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:54.720
<v Speaker 2>like he felt it within an hour or two.</v>

248
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.250
<v Speaker 2>I think it takes me a few hours at the very least have to feel any effect of it.</v>

249
00:07:59.620 --> 00:07:59.881
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

250
00:07:59.881 --> 00:08:01.040
<v Speaker 2>I always want to be careful of like,</v>

251
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.850
<v Speaker 2>what is the placebo effect?</v>

252
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not bullshitting myself.</v>

253
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:05.161
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

254
00:08:05.161 --> 00:08:08.700
<v Speaker 2>the main reason why I say I'm not bullshit myself was because of the dreams that</v>

255
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 2>I never had dreams like this before.</v>

256
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.180
<v Speaker 2>There's no way that that is bullshit.</v>

257
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.400
<v Speaker 2>That's because I didn't expect that.</v>

258
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.510
<v Speaker 2>So when it happened,</v>

259
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.560
<v Speaker 2>it was a very tangible result of something new that's been introduced into my</v>

260
00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:20.394
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

261
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's been new Alpha brain shit.</v>

262
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.450
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing it does is it I've,</v>

263
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.840
<v Speaker 2>I know I don't sound like a smooth talker right now,</v>

264
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:28.771
<v Speaker 2>but I'm tired.</v>

265
00:08:28.771 --> 00:08:29.604
<v Speaker 2>I've been working all day.</v>

266
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I do a scene.</v>

267
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.110
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that my words flow out better.</v>

268
00:08:34.111 --> 00:08:35.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm searching for words less.</v>

269
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:37.080
<v Speaker 2>I feel cleaner.</v>

270
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.390
<v Speaker 2>I felt like my mind works more crisply.</v>

271
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

272
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.500
<v Speaker 3>Do you agree with that?</v>

273
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.640
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel what you feel to,</v>

274
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.200
<v Speaker 3>what's that drug that writers use?</v>

275
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.080
<v Speaker 3>Adderall is like natural Adderall for me.</v>

276
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.530
<v Speaker 2>That's what Dunkin keeps saying.</v>

277
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Dunkin keep saying it's like a mile.</v>

278
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.250
<v Speaker 2>And I'm scared of it.</v>

279
00:08:51.251 --> 00:08:52.240
<v Speaker 2>That sounds awesome.</v>

280
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Out of Adderall scares the shit out of me because I think I would love it.</v>

281
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:55.351
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

282
00:08:55.351 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever worry about heart attacks or anything?</v>

337
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:08.631
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

338
00:10:08.631 --> 00:10:10.310
<v Speaker 1>constantly with everything.</v>

339
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.183
<v Speaker 1>The uh,</v>

340
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.400
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

343
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:16.930
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

344
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:17.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

345
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.410
<v Speaker 1>I think about like,</v>

346
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think about him often,</v>

347
00:10:20.181 --> 00:10:20.511
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

348
00:10:20.511 --> 00:10:20.631
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

349
00:10:20.631 --> 00:10:22.280
<v Speaker 1>it's smoking and drinking and,</v>

350
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.870
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

351
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

352
00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:23.411
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>

353
00:10:23.411 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

354
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.390
<v Speaker 2>closer to 40.</v>

355
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:25.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like 44,</v>

356
00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:26.280
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

357
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

358
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.780
<v Speaker 2>Well you exercise pretty,</v>

359
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.531
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

360
00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's like a lot of it is fighting father time.</v>

361
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:31.211
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

362
00:10:31.211 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to make sure that it doesn't slide too far back.</v>

363
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Take vitamins all day and monitoring my health and getting my blood work done</v>

364
00:10:37.661 --> 00:10:41.400
<v Speaker 2>and drinking this crazy green shit they're going to get in and all that shit</v>

365
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.420
<v Speaker 2>that this green drink I drink every morning a drink first thing in the day to</v>

366
00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:45.661
<v Speaker 2>Kevin.</v>

367
00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 2>James taught me about it cause he uh,</v>

368
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:48.780
<v Speaker 2>he lost incredible amount of weight.</v>

369
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:49.830
<v Speaker 2>He lost like 80 pounds,</v>

370
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:51.780
<v Speaker 2>started looking great face slimmed up.</v>

371
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.170
<v Speaker 2>And what he did was he started drinking this really healthy plant based smoothie</v>

372
00:10:56.171 --> 00:10:57.300
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning of every day.</v>

373
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.700
<v Speaker 2>So every day starts off of this plant based smoothie.</v>

374
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:00.534
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is,</v>

375
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.051
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

376
00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:01.681
<v Speaker 2>it's very rare.</v>

377
00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:02.870
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of roughage.</v>

378
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:07.830
<v Speaker 2>It's fiber cleans out your system and it's sort of lubes the way up for all the</v>

379
00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:09.000
<v Speaker 2>food that comes behind it.</v>

380
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.420
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is to start off your day with one of these things and it's just sort</v>

381
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:15.690
<v Speaker 2>of like cleans the track and it makes all of your food digest better,</v>

382
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.610
<v Speaker 2>chew your food much better,</v>

383
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:17.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

384
00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:19.620
<v Speaker 2>don't eat shit with a lot of chemicals in it.</v>

385
00:11:19.621 --> 00:11:21.750
<v Speaker 2>And so he just didn't altering his diet that way.</v>

386
00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Is potty just for it just fucking changed.</v>

387
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.170
<v Speaker 2>He was basically eating entirely plant based diet for the first time in his</v>

388
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:28.740
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

389
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.460
<v Speaker 2>Just changes,</v>

390
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.770
<v Speaker 2>health changed everything changed the way you know,</v>

391
00:11:31.771 --> 00:11:32.700
<v Speaker 2>the way he felt.</v>

392
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:36.240
<v Speaker 2>He would get up in the morning and feel fucking fantastic like all of his life.</v>

393
00:11:36.241 --> 00:11:36.451
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

394
00:11:36.451 --> 00:11:38.130
<v Speaker 2>he's been a big guy and you know,</v>

395
00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:38.791
<v Speaker 2>he's getting older.</v>

396
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:40.710
<v Speaker 2>His joints were starting to hurt and he said I would get up.</v>

397
00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:41.910
<v Speaker 2>I'd feel like a fucking old man.</v>

398
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:42.451
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

399
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:44.980
<v Speaker 2>I started drinking this green drink and drinking it everyday.</v>

400
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

401
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.270
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

402
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:47.421
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

403
00:11:47.421 --> 00:11:50.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not prepackaged show you make it.</v>

404
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

405
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Well well this is my green shake that I make everything.</v>

406
00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.990
<v Speaker 1>This is what I learned this from Kevin James who lost like lost like 80 pounds.</v>

407
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.040
<v Speaker 1>What it is mostly is fresh Kale,</v>

408
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.593
<v Speaker 1>Kale,</v>

409
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:09.821
<v Speaker 1>cucumber,</v>

410
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:10.654
<v Speaker 1>celery,</v>

411
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.160
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of um,</v>

412
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.900
<v Speaker 1>ginger and I throw a pair on there as well.</v>

413
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:19.940
<v Speaker 1>And we do everything about mixing an apple on there.</v>

414
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

415
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:52.480
<v Speaker 1>take all this stuff</v>

416
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:55.360
<v Speaker 1>and I'll bring it over here.</v>

417
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:56.471
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>

418
00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:58.390
<v Speaker 1>This is awesome for first and foremost,</v>

419
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.123
<v Speaker 1>your poop</v>

420
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.510
<v Speaker 1>poop just slides.</v>

421
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.093
<v Speaker 1>Do is</v>

422
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.280
<v Speaker 1>first thing I chop up,</v>

423
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.670
<v Speaker 1>is there a reason why you use a blender instead of a juicer?</v>

424
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

425
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.870
<v Speaker 1>because the a,</v>

426
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.980
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that when you're juicing things,</v>

427
00:13:38.981 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting all of the planning and not getting the fiber,</v>

428
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.560
<v Speaker 1>which is great for your body.</v>

429
00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.090
<v Speaker 1>What this is is</v>

430
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:55.090
<v Speaker 1>having to break it all down and chew and chew it and swallow and eat all these</v>

431
00:13:55.091 --> 00:13:55.924
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>

432
00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.120
<v Speaker 1>which should be boring as fuck really to eat.</v>

433
00:13:58.121 --> 00:13:59.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm in this state except the payer.</v>

434
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:00.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

435
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.503
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of boring,</v>

436
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.890
<v Speaker 1>so what you do is you blend it all up and drink it as a shape.</v>

437
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.620
