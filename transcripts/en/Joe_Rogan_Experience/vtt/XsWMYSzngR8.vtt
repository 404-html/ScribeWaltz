<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

157
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.610
<v Speaker 3>She had swastikas tattooed.</v>

158
00:03:49.611 --> 00:03:50.251
<v Speaker 3>So stop it.</v>

159

<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>

160

<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

168
00:03:59.661 --> 00:04:03.800
<v Speaker 3>my point is that she had this sleeve and I looked at the sleeve and I said,</v>

169
00:04:03.801 --> 00:04:05.570
<v Speaker 3>that's an Aaron Dellavedova Tattoo.</v>

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.850
<v Speaker 3>Although it does say WP on her leg.</v>

267
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.530
<v Speaker 1>we have it on it,</v>

268
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.383
<v Speaker 1>like a meaningful,</v>

269
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.493
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning.</v>

270
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 1>First Sleeve?</v>

271
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

272
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:26.940
<v Speaker 1>At the beginning of the first leak.</v>

273
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.250
<v Speaker 3>A lot.</v>

274
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.851
<v Speaker 3>It was on video,</v>

275
00:06:27.851 --> 00:06:29.440
<v Speaker 3>but then the second sleeve is like,</v>

276
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.020
<v Speaker 3>like about three years old.</v>

277
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.490
<v Speaker 3>I still have to go back.</v>

278
00:06:33.491 --> 00:06:33.791
<v Speaker 3>I still,</v>

279
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:35.950
<v Speaker 3>there's a few spots on it.</v>

280
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.521
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

281
00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:38.580
<v Speaker 3>Most of it is a memo to Musashi peace.</v>

282
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.060
<v Speaker 3>Who is the guy who is the,</v>

283
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

284
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.120
<v Speaker 1>and there's the graphics joker.</v>

285
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 1>I thought you got rid of the graphics Cherokee.</v>

286
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

287
00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:45.510
<v Speaker 1>I thought you did too.</v>

288
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.630
<v Speaker 3>I have to suck.</v>

289
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 3>It's not quite done yet.</v>

290
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:48.763
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>

291
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>I think they should pump that out.</v>

292
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

293
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

294
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not really,</v>

295
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 1>even before I knew what a graphics joke or what you drew it,</v>

296
00:06:56.871 --> 00:06:57.201
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

297
00:06:57.201 --> 00:06:58.011
<v Speaker 1>Stupid idea.</v>

298
00:06:58.011 --> 00:06:58.221

<v Speaker 1>I did draw a lot.</v>

308
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.960
<v Speaker 3>I drew that in 1990.</v>

309
00:07:13.961 --> 00:07:15.190
<v Speaker 3>It looks like shit now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the beach.</v>

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:44.890
<v Speaker 3>What was the,</v>

331
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.930
<v Speaker 3>what was the term for what</v>

332
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.401
<v Speaker 1>for you?</v>

333
00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Like where were you,</v>

334
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.660
<v Speaker 1>you went from like one tattoo and not smoking weed to like,</v>

335
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

336
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:52.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

337
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.720
<v Speaker 1>maybe I've heard say no</v>

338
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:54.780
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

339
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

340
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.213
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

341
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.330
<v Speaker 3>I always like,</v>

342
00:07:57.331 --> 00:07:58.200
<v Speaker 3>like tattoos.</v>

343
00:07:58.201 --> 00:07:59.760
<v Speaker 3>I always liked the artwork of it.</v>

344
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of,</v>

345
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of music.</v>

346
00:08:03.001 --> 00:08:04.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of writing.</v>

347
00:08:04.261 --> 00:08:07.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of meat movies and cars and,</v>

348
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:08.391
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

349
00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:13.260
<v Speaker 3>and paintings and anything that you do that expresses whatever you have inside</v>

350
00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:14.940
<v Speaker 3>of yourself through some medium,</v>

351
00:08:14.941 --> 00:08:19.920
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a medium of making a hot rod or it's the medium of even designing</v>

352
00:08:19.921 --> 00:08:20.581
<v Speaker 3>clothes.</v>

353
00:08:20.581 --> 00:08:21.414
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm like,</v>

354
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.460
<v Speaker 3>like I'm wearing some crazy tee shirt right now.</v>

355
00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:24.300
<v Speaker 3>Some dude gave me,</v>

356
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.490
<v Speaker 3>it's a Bruce Lee who's a,</v>

357
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.140
<v Speaker 3>he's acting as a DJ.</v>

358
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.400
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was hilarious.</v>

359
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:30.080
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

360
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.811
<v Speaker 3>but it's great.</v>

361
00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:31.644
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>

362
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.830
<v Speaker 3>someone's idea that's expressed through clothes,</v>

363
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:35.461
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

364
00:08:35.461 --> 00:08:36.910
<v Speaker 3>you can express it through furniture.</v>

365
00:08:36.911 --> 00:08:37.744
<v Speaker 3>I like</v>

366
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.510
<v Speaker 1>my friend away in this table tables,</v>

367
00:08:40.511 --> 00:08:41.344
<v Speaker 1>bad ass.</v>

368
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:42.190
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

369
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.590
<v Speaker 3>you can express it through anything,</v>

370
00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:45.341
<v Speaker 3>but it really,</v>

371
00:08:45.341 --> 00:08:46.330
<v Speaker 3>it's all the same thing.</v>

372
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:47.530
<v Speaker 3>The eye,</v>

373
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:52.530
<v Speaker 3>the idea is that everything that a person can enjoy is someone else trying to</v>

374
00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 3>express some sort of positive through whatever medium it is.</v>

375
00:08:57.151 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's a fucking,</v>

376
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.611
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

377
00:08:58.611 --> 00:09:00.000
<v Speaker 3>there's les Miserables,</v>

378
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.730
<v Speaker 4>50 shades of grey.</v>

379
00:09:03.731 --> 00:09:04.810
<v Speaker 4>It's all the same thing.</v>

380
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.030
<v Speaker 4>But what was the turning point?</v>

381
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.020
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember the thing?</v>

382
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.963
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

383
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 3>I know I was probably some psychedelic drug related to experience.</v>

384
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:13.970
<v Speaker 3>Most likely.</v>

385
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:14.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

386
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:14.821
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

387
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:15.654
<v Speaker 3>That was the the</v>

388
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.760
<v Speaker 4>but what got you there?</v>

389
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:18.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

390
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.440
<v Speaker 3>well if marijuana is a gateway drug,</v>

391
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm really unfortunately a good example.</v>

392
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.333
<v Speaker 4>I don't think</v>

393
00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.730
<v Speaker 3>that it's a negative gateway.</v>

394
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.500
<v Speaker 3>I think we have to get over that idea.</v>

395
00:09:32.501 --> 00:09:35.050
<v Speaker 3>And I think a big part of the struggle that we have in this country,</v>

396
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:40.150
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of conservative people misunderstand the position of people that,</v>

397
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:40.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

398
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.790
<v Speaker 3>support marijuana or cannabis.</v>

399
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.000
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't mean that they're mutually exclusive and it doesn't mean that</v>

400
00:09:46.001 --> 00:09:47.590
<v Speaker 3>they have to be in combat with each other.</v>

401
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.080
<v Speaker 3>It just means that for whatever reason,</v>

402
00:09:50.081 --> 00:09:51.010
<v Speaker 3>as a society,</v>

403
00:09:51.011 --> 00:09:54.850
<v Speaker 3>we have associated cannabis smokers and users with lazy bitches.</v>

404
00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.103
<v Speaker 3>And that's stupid.</v>

405
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.860
<v Speaker 3>And I think that if I have benefited as a,</v>

406
00:09:59.861 --> 00:10:01.690
<v Speaker 3>an unnecessarily aggro,</v>

407
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.940
<v Speaker 3>you no child of the 80s if I have benefited from the magical gift of marijuana,</v>

408
00:10:07.871 --> 00:10:09.910
<v Speaker 3>then I bet you can too.</v>

409
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:14.290
<v Speaker 3>It just needs to be used properly and it's going to make you examine yourself in</v>

410
00:10:14.291 --> 00:10:18.610
<v Speaker 3>a way that may be uncomfortable but is most likely necessary.</v>

411
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:19.451
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

412
00:10:19.451 --> 00:10:24.451
<v Speaker 3>and the ideas that we have connected to any sort of psychedelic experience,</v>

413
00:10:25.361 --> 00:10:27.660
<v Speaker 3>marijuana or pay,</v>

414
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.471
<v Speaker 3>Yo the knee,</v>

415
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:29.111
<v Speaker 3>you name it,</v>

416
00:10:29.111 --> 00:10:33.220
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms automatically people of a conservative nature.</v>

417
00:10:33.221 --> 00:10:38.080
<v Speaker 3>We'll assume that the people involved in doing this thing or being lazy or</v>

418
00:10:38.081 --> 00:10:38.980
<v Speaker 3>they're being,</v>

419
00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.660
<v Speaker 3>they're being frivolous,</v>

420
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.430
<v Speaker 3>they're being frivolous because they've decided to like seek escape through</v>

421
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.130
<v Speaker 3>chemicals rather than deal with the reality.</v>

422
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.860
<v Speaker 3>But if they really knew,</v>

423
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.780
<v Speaker 3>they would know that that's not the case.</v>

424
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.070
<v Speaker 3>If they really had experienced,</v>

425
00:10:54.071 --> 00:10:54.701
<v Speaker 3>they would know that.</v>

426
00:10:54.701 --> 00:10:55.001
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

427
00:10:55.001 --> 00:10:56.350
<v Speaker 3>it's exact opposite.</v>

428
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:56.631
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

429
00:10:56.631 --> 00:11:00.260
<v Speaker 4>I hate to fucking bring up this God damn radio lab show again.</v>

430
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 4>They were talking about religious experiences and people who did acid and,</v>

431
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:06.020
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>

432
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:06.830
<v Speaker 4>and there was uh,</v>

433
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:07.101
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>

434
00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:07.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

435
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.660
<v Speaker 4>they were talking about they took these kids,</v>

436
00:11:09.661 --> 00:11:11.390
<v Speaker 4>it's too in school.</v>

437
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.870
<v Speaker 4>Took him down to a church setting where a church sermon was giving,</v>

438
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.621
<v Speaker 4>going on.</v>

439
00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:16.850
<v Speaker 4>They're all religious teachers.</v>

440
00:11:16.851 --> 00:11:17.684
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

441
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.950
<v Speaker 4>All religious teachers.</v>

442
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.300
<v Speaker 4>I like religious students.</v>

443
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.010
<v Speaker 4>They all take acid and they hear a sermon,</v>

444
00:11:22.011 --> 00:11:22.560
<v Speaker 4>the church,</v>

445
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.450
<v Speaker 4>the beautiful bells.</v>

446
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.320
<v Speaker 4>And they said that nine out of 10 people in the test group,</v>

447
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.270
<v Speaker 4>so there's 2010 have,</v>

448
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:29.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

449
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.000
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

450
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

451
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:30.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

452
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:31.773
<v Speaker 4>a bullshit,</v>

453
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:32.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

454
00:11:32.151 --> 00:11:32.984
<v Speaker 4>the placebo,</v>

455
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.800
<v Speaker 4>10 of the one,</v>

456
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.001
<v Speaker 4>nine,</v>

457
00:11:34.001 --> 00:11:35.930
<v Speaker 4>nine of the 10 had a religious experience.</v>

458
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:41.500
<v Speaker 4>And they were saying that that nine out of 10 also went on to teach in the</v>

459
00:11:41.721 --> 00:11:42.440
<v Speaker 4>ministry,</v>

460
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.850
<v Speaker 4>like nine of the 10 people that took acid.</v>

461
00:11:43.851 --> 00:11:47.150
<v Speaker 4>And they were talking about the concept of whether or not you could do acid and</v>

462
00:11:47.151 --> 00:11:49.640
<v Speaker 4>whether or not you could create original religious experience.</v>

463
00:11:49.641 --> 00:11:50.331
<v Speaker 4>And if you could,</v>

464
00:11:50.331 --> 00:11:51.800
<v Speaker 4>why wouldn't you have that all the time?</v>

465
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

466
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:53.030
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't ever want to look for,</v>

467
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:53.601
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

468
00:11:53.601 --> 00:11:54.830
<v Speaker 3>what's what we were talking about earlier,</v>

469
00:11:54.831 --> 00:11:59.510
<v Speaker 3>but like one day maybe we can get our shitty brains to accept a state of opiate</v>

470
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.470
<v Speaker 3>and Mgma at the same time all the time.</v>

471
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.330
<v Speaker 4>I want like a low grade cocaine.</v>

472
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.981
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>

473
00:12:06.981 --> 00:12:07.251
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

474
00:12:07.251 --> 00:12:09.860
<v Speaker 3>all respect to people who are on antidepressants.</v>

475
00:12:09.861 --> 00:12:11.390
<v Speaker 3>And this is not an antidepressant rant.</v>

476
00:12:11.391 --> 00:12:13.250
<v Speaker 3>And I think quite honestly,</v>

477
00:12:13.251 --> 00:12:15.290
<v Speaker 3>that there's quite a few of those rants that,</v>

478
00:12:15.291 --> 00:12:16.280
<v Speaker 3>or they're ignorant.</v>

479
00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.120
<v Speaker 3>And even though,</v>

480
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

481
00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:17.491
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

482
00:12:17.491 --> 00:12:17.931
<v Speaker 3>we had,</v>

483
00:12:17.931 --> 00:12:18.320
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

484
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.310
<v Speaker 3>a conversation with,</v>

485
00:12:19.311 --> 00:12:19.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

486
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Kara Santa Maria who was on [inaudible],</v>

487
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.780
<v Speaker 4>I fucking loved her.</v>

488
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 4>That girl was so fucking,</v>

489
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:24.760
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

490
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.060
<v Speaker 4>I've regurgitated some of her facts in conversation,</v>

491
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:29.200
<v Speaker 4>not realizing I'm doing it.</v>

492
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.011
<v Speaker 4>I fucking was.</v>

493
00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:32.560
<v Speaker 4>So I was afraid to Google her and see what she looked like.</v>

494
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:32.981
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>

495
00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:33.191
<v Speaker 4>what is,</v>

496
00:12:33.191 --> 00:12:35.770
<v Speaker 4>she's not hot because she was so hot on this podcast.</v>

497
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.671
<v Speaker 4>Just listen to her.</v>

498
00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:37.150
<v Speaker 4>You were like,</v>

499
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.391
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

500
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:38.240
<v Speaker 4>she's beautiful.</v>

501
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.600
<v Speaker 3>More importantly,</v>

502
00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:41.890
<v Speaker 3>she's very fascinating.</v>

503
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:42.270
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

504
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.780
<v Speaker 3>very fascinating.</v>

505
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.460
<v Speaker 3>And what was my point?</v>

506
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.370
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

507
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.530
<v Speaker 4>I think psychedelics are about three of them in a row.</v>

508
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:49.170
<v Speaker 4>Psychedelics,</v>

509
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:49.890
<v Speaker 4>are you taking that off?</v>

510
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:50.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

511
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.800
<v Speaker 4>next week.</v>

512
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.633
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking her home.</v>

513
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.760
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to double date?</v>

514
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:53.743
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

515
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.970
<v Speaker 4>Trying to can just hinted rubbing his tickets</v>

516
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:04.490
<v Speaker 3>point was that she was describing her own personal benefit from,</v>

517
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:04.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

518
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.640
<v Speaker 3>from using antidepressants and her own personal,</v>

519
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

520
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.400
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

521
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.230
<v Speaker 3>her personal benefit from like regulating her state of consciousness,</v>

522
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:13.910
<v Speaker 3>but with the use of science.</v>

523
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.440
<v Speaker 3>And if you really stop and think about it,</v>

524
00:13:15.441 --> 00:13:16.190
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

525
00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.250
<v Speaker 3>some of the best feelings that I've ever had have been under the,</v>

526
00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:19.521
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

527
00:13:19.521 --> 00:13:21.170
<v Speaker 3>under the influence of chemicals.</v>

528
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.621
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

529
00:13:21.621 --> 00:13:23.420
<v Speaker 3>whether it's right now or whether it's,</v>

530
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

531
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:29.020
<v Speaker 3>the first time I ever did anything which was an Mtma anything of significance</v>

532
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:29.700
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

533
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.420
<v Speaker 3>when that feeling is so sensational.</v>

534
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Like what would life be if that feeling existed all the time?</v>

535
00:13:35.241 --> 00:13:39.680
<v Speaker 3>We automatically have this thought in our head that that cannot be managed and</v>

536
00:13:39.681 --> 00:13:44.681
<v Speaker 3>that needs to be discarded right away immediately for the state of consciousness</v>

537
00:13:44.721 --> 00:13:46.580
<v Speaker 3>that exist right now can never be elevated.</v>

538
00:13:46.581 --> 00:13:47.414
<v Speaker 3>This is what it is,</v>

539
00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:48.800
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know even know that's true.</v>

540
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:49.650
<v Speaker 4>I Aye.</v>

541
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:49.940
<v Speaker 4>Aye.</v>

542
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.060
<v Speaker 4>I wonder sometimes because I go like,</v>

543
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

544
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:53.560
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

545
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.390
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I spend my day chasing,</v>

546
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.010
<v Speaker 4>chasing a buzz where it's like,</v>

547
00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.300
<v Speaker 4>like coffee in the morning and then there's just like dead period in the</v>

548
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:01.310
<v Speaker 4>afternoon.</v>

549
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.631
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

550
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:01.930
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

551
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:02.970
<v Speaker 4>before the beer cart,</v>

552
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.480
<v Speaker 4>when you feel it's respectable to start drinking at five,</v>

553
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.860
<v Speaker 4>5:00 PM 5:00 PM</v>

554
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:10.931
<v Speaker 4>5:00 PM,</v>

555
00:14:10.931 --> 00:14:11.321
<v Speaker 4>they can say,</v>

556
00:14:11.321 --> 00:14:12.090
<v Speaker 4>leave me alone.</v>

557
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:12.870
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

558
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:13.703
<v Speaker 4>At work.</v>

559
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.460
<v Speaker 4>Who keeps the fucking lights on.</v>

560
00:14:15.461 --> 00:14:19.660
<v Speaker 4>Some of the best moments of my life are when my wife had a job.</v>

561
00:14:19.661 --> 00:14:20.400
<v Speaker 4>We were living in a,</v>

562
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.760
<v Speaker 4>in an apartment complex.</v>

563
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.210
<v Speaker 4>We had a nanny only because I was on the road and sometimes the nanny and I</v>

564
00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:26.920
<v Speaker 4>would overlap and I'd be there when she would be there.</v>

565
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.660
<v Speaker 4>The best feelings my kids are,</v>

566
00:14:28.661 --> 00:14:30.880
<v Speaker 4>they're sunsetting in Hollywood.</v>

567
00:14:30.881 --> 00:14:32.850
<v Speaker 4>My wife fucking end up in the door and just go and do,</v>

568
00:14:32.851 --> 00:14:34.060
<v Speaker 4>they won't open a bottle of wine.</v>

569
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.940
<v Speaker 4>Oh motherfucker.</v>

570
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:40.690
<v Speaker 4>I remember getting like chills like it's Christmas Eve and we crack open a</v>

571
00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:42.220
<v Speaker 4>bottle of wine pouring for the nanny.</v>

572
00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:43.450
<v Speaker 4>We just sit on the couch.</v>

573
00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:44.284
<v Speaker 4>It's socks.</v>

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.540
<v Speaker 3>You love leg ultimate moments where everybody agrees.</v>

577
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.100

591
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:09.981

593
00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:11.690

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.561

00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:12.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

596
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:13.940
<v Speaker 3>I love that feeling.</v>

597
00:15:13.941 --> 00:15:14.261
<v Speaker 3>And when,</v>

598
00:15:14.261 --> 00:15:16.580
<v Speaker 3>when like it's like just fucking,</v>

599
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:17.780
<v Speaker 3>someone just goes,</v>

600
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:18.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

601
00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.850
<v Speaker 4>I go was going to be awkward if I order a beer and some would be like,</v>

602
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:23.081
<v Speaker 4>if you get one,</v>

603
00:15:23.081 --> 00:15:23.411
<v Speaker 4>I'll get one.</v>

604
00:15:23.411 --> 00:15:23.621
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

605
00:15:23.621 --> 00:15:24.454
<v Speaker 4>we're fucking</v>

606
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.410
<v Speaker 4>right away.</v>

607
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:27.250
<v Speaker 4>Can love that feeling.</v>

608
00:15:27.251 --> 00:15:30.340
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what the feeling people get when they connect when they smoked</v>

609
00:15:30.341 --> 00:15:32.490
<v Speaker 4>marijuana is that someone likes it and then they're like,</v>

610
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.190
<v Speaker 3>Nah.</v>

611
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:33.450
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

612
00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:33.610
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

613
00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:34.510
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

614
00:15:34.511 --> 00:15:36.070
<v Speaker 3>Like it's such a great,</v>

615
00:15:36.071 --> 00:15:40.090
<v Speaker 3>like there's definitely a thing that comes with being like in that sort of</v>

616
00:15:40.091 --> 00:15:41.960
<v Speaker 3>fraternity of people that know,</v>

617
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.133
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

618
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.661
<v Speaker 3>then no,</v>

619
00:15:43.661 --> 00:15:44.560
<v Speaker 3>you'd smoked pot.</v>

620
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.281
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's in.</v>

621
00:15:45.281 --> 00:15:45.640
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

622
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:45.851
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

623
00:15:45.851 --> 00:15:46.421
<v Speaker 3>we're all cool.</v>

624
00:15:46.421 --> 00:15:47.254
<v Speaker 3>And it was right.</v>

625
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:53.350
<v Speaker 3>As much as you sort of accepts that traditional notion of reality.</v>

626
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.480
<v Speaker 3>Like if you've never gotten high,</v>

627
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.430
<v Speaker 3>you and I have very little to talk about.</v>

628
00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:00.221
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

629
00:16:00.221 --> 00:16:02.950
<v Speaker 3>we can talk about a few things for certain,</v>

630
00:16:02.951 --> 00:16:07.870
<v Speaker 3>we can talk about facts and Statistics and history and numbers.</v>

631
00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.820
<v Speaker 3>We can talk a lot about a lot of things,</v>

632
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.580
<v Speaker 3>but we can't talk about what the fuck is going on.</v>

633
00:16:12.581 --> 00:16:15.610
<v Speaker 3>When you think about someone and then the phone rings and it's them,</v>

634
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.720
<v Speaker 3>you can't talk about that because you're going to give me some scaredy cat</v>

635
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.560
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>

636
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.393
<v Speaker 3>You're going to go well,</v>

637
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.730
<v Speaker 3>it was just sort of a coincidence,</v>

638
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.780
<v Speaker 3>no relationship whatsoever.</v>

639
00:16:27.781 --> 00:16:31.480
<v Speaker 3>There's never been a statistical correlation between you think the mount someone</v>

640
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.140
<v Speaker 3>and then them calling you and not meaning anything significant whatsoever.</v>

641
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.790
<v Speaker 3>It's just nonsense.</v>

642
00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:42.070
<v Speaker 3>I need you to get a rip and put a tie on where some shiny shoes with slippery</v>

643
00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:45.460
<v Speaker 3>souls and walked down the street like a gentleman.</v>

644
00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:48.071
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

645
00:16:48.071 --> 00:16:49.260
<v Speaker 3>But I know that when I,</v>

646
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:53.830
<v Speaker 3>a little light bulb goes off in my head and I think about Bert Kreischer and</v>

647
00:16:53.831 --> 00:16:58.831
<v Speaker 3>then I looked down at my phone and it starts ringing immediately and it's Bert</v>

648
00:16:59.170 --> 00:16:59.410
<v Speaker 3>Kreischer,</v>

649
00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.140
<v Speaker 3>well call me crazy,</v>

650
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.090
<v Speaker 3>but I think something's up.</v>

651
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:05.381
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

652
00:17:05.381 --> 00:17:10.381
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something fucking going on when I think about you and then all</v>

653
00:17:10.451 --> 00:17:12.970
<v Speaker 3>of a sudden you call me immediately.</v>

654
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.260
<v Speaker 4>It happens every day nonstop,</v>

655
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.473
<v Speaker 4>a lot.</v>

656
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.900
<v Speaker 4>And you know when it happens,</v>

657
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:19.700
<v Speaker 4>you ready for this Brian Red Ban.</v>

658
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:20.953
<v Speaker 4>It happens</v>

659

<v Speaker 3>live in your life correctly.</v>

660
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.040
<v Speaker 3>When you live in your life correctly,</v>

661
00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:29.870
<v Speaker 3>the universe gives you a lot of fucking secret messages.</v>

662
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.023
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

663
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.450
<v Speaker 4>I like yesterday,</v>

664
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.410
<v Speaker 4>this is something crazy.</v>

665
00:17:35.411 --> 00:17:36.101
<v Speaker 4>As an example,</v>

666
00:17:36.101 --> 00:17:39.310
<v Speaker 4>yesterday I was talking to my friend who's a ginger and I'm like,</v>

667

<v Speaker 4>is there such things as Jewish ginger's I've never even heard is like I've never</v>

668
00:17:43.421 --> 00:17:44.830
<v Speaker 4>seen a Jewish ginger before.</v>

669
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.250

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:49.961
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

673
00:17:49.961 --> 00:17:50.621

675
00:17:51.851 --> 00:17:53.020
<v Speaker 4>He's a Jewish gender.</v>

676
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:53.920
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen one of them?</v>

677
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.640

680
00:17:58.751 --> 00:17:59.170
<v Speaker 4>one day</v>

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.540
<v Speaker 3>there's a possibility that you attracted down.</v>

682
00:18:01.541 --> 00:18:05.890
<v Speaker 3>There's a possibility that much like you ever sent an email on Google,</v>

683
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.780
<v Speaker 3>you know it could be about anything.</v>

684

<v Speaker 3>You can just like send an email and say,</v>

685
00:18:09.641 --> 00:18:10.331
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

686
00:18:10.331 --> 00:18:15.331
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking to get a life size copy of the robot from lost in space</v>

687
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.280
<v Speaker 4>base and then you look in the corner of your Gmail when you get on.</v>

688
00:18:20.281 --> 00:18:20.551
<v Speaker 4>I ended up,</v>

689
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:22.320
<v Speaker 4>y'all lost in space shit.</v>

690

<v Speaker 4>That's reading.</v>

691
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:23.940
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

692
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:24.420
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

693
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:24.840
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

694
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.671
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

695
00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:27.890
<v Speaker 4>So you think somebody is reading my presently,</v>

696
00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:31.290
<v Speaker 4>this is my point.</v>

697
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:36.470
<v Speaker 4>If reality is a simulation wouldn't have followed the same principles that your</v>

698
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:38.790
<v Speaker 4>g-mail or your Yahoo has,</v>

699
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.540
<v Speaker 4>where you'll see the corners where shit you've sent emails about,</v>

700
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.990
<v Speaker 4>we'll be reoccurring themes in your life and do that in life all the time.</v>

701
00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:46.980
<v Speaker 4>I've put it out there,</v>

702
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.090
<v Speaker 4>but isn't it fascinating it out there is it mirrors.</v>

703
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.250
<v Speaker 4>It mirrors what we know is a program.</v>

704
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:53.821
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

705
00:18:53.821 --> 00:18:54.660
<v Speaker 4>that's fucked up.</v>

706
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:55.290
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

707
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:55.950
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

708
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:56.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

709
00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:00.090
<v Speaker 4>It's just the fucking natural course of history of how life's going to go down.</v>

710
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.350
<v Speaker 4>It already happens in life.</v>

711
00:19:01.351 --> 00:19:02.190
<v Speaker 4>God does it well.</v>

712
00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:03.001
<v Speaker 4>The universe does.</v>

713
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:04.530
<v Speaker 4>It trickles onto you.</v>

714
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.090
<v Speaker 4>You sound like you're right for a cult.</v>

715
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.820
<v Speaker 4>I could fucking gate you just shut up and write something.</v>

718
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.510
<v Speaker 4>I've been watching this</v>

719
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:21.650
<v Speaker 3>documentary on the vice guys and made a documentary about this fucking dude</v>

720
00:19:21.651 --> 00:19:22.484
<v Speaker 3>who's a,</v>

721
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.290
<v Speaker 3>he's the new Jesus.</v>

722
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.850
<v Speaker 3>He's a Siberian Jesus.</v>

723
00:19:25.851 --> 00:19:26.790
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that Brian?</v>

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.830
<v Speaker 4>we shouldn't pull it up because it's a really long piece.</v>

729
00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.490
<v Speaker 4>You guys are crazy.</v>

730
00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.820
<v Speaker 3>I've only watched the first two 10 minute pieces,</v>

731
00:19:38.821 --> 00:19:40.200
<v Speaker 3>but it's fascinating.</v>

732
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.830
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy in Siberia that's created a village and he's like the second</v>

733
00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:44.664
<v Speaker 3>coming of Jesus.</v>

734
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:45.840
<v Speaker 3>He's like the new Jesus,</v>

735
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.360
<v Speaker 3>and he has thousands of people that they're living up there.</v>

736
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:49.583
<v Speaker 3>Thousands.</v>

737
00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:50.371
<v Speaker 3>They're all living up there.</v>

738
00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:51.240
<v Speaker 3>But meanwhile,</v>

739
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.220
<v Speaker 3>they're living in an unbelievably,</v>

740
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.020
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably beautiful place.</v>

741
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:55.261
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

742
00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:56.460
<v Speaker 3>it is stunning.</v>

743
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.250
<v Speaker 3>If maybe maybe seeding if find some photos,</v>

744
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:00.180
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

745
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.680
<v Speaker 3>it's staggeringly beautiful.</v>

746
00:20:01.681 --> 00:20:02.580
<v Speaker 3>And this guy,</v>

747
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.670
<v Speaker 3>he's not p appreciate anything bad except being a Vegan.</v>

748
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.510
<v Speaker 3>That's silly.</v>

749
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.010
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

750
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.730
<v Speaker 4>I can't think of it.</v>

751
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.860
<v Speaker 4>I got to have for me Vegan fucking,</v>

752
00:20:09.861 --> 00:20:11.210
<v Speaker 4>even when I was doing that clean program,</v>

753
00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:12.044
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

754
00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.540
<v Speaker 4>I'd have a chicken with fucking lettuce wraps.</v>

755
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

756
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.130
<v Speaker 3>I love spicy shit.</v>

757
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:17.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

758
00:20:17.731 --> 00:20:19.750
<v Speaker 3>I wish that animals weren't so fucking delicious.</v>

759
00:20:19.751 --> 00:20:23.430
<v Speaker 3>It's the fucking amazing and I wish that they didn't fucking keep making</v>

760
00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:24.264
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

761
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.170
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they would just all live forever and everyone will be a mortal.</v>

762
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.220
<v Speaker 3>We have enough numbers now and just keep it going.</v>

763
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.300
<v Speaker 4>I had duck heartland who?</v>

764
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.900
<v Speaker 3>The photo of the dude.</v>

765
00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:34.350
<v Speaker 3>Who's the,</v>

766
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.520
<v Speaker 3>the Russian Jesus.</v>

767
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.260
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile he's got an awesome,</v>

768
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I ever saw Jesus smile.</v>

769
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.591
<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>

770
00:20:40.591 --> 00:20:40.741
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

771
00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:41.574
<v Speaker 4>Green Day's plans.</v>

772
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.950
<v Speaker 4>Sad cause he's hurt the [inaudible] Jesus.</v>

773
00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.360
<v Speaker 4>His pictures were like hip hop cover albums.</v>

774
00:20:47.361 --> 00:20:48.230
<v Speaker 4>I just was up</v>

775
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:49.421
<v Speaker 3>the Australian,</v>

776
00:20:49.421 --> 00:20:52.200
<v Speaker 3>Jesus is a guy in Queensland and he says he's</v>

777
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:52.820
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

778
00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.120
<v Speaker 4>It was just in Queensland.</v>

779
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.440
<v Speaker 4>What's that guy love level you do.</v>

780
00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.240
<v Speaker 4>Are you doing to stand up?</v>

781
00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:57.410
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

782
00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.630
<v Speaker 4>he did a triplet and Australia in Queensland.</v>

783
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.490
<v Speaker 4>Australia.</v>

784
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:02.520
<v Speaker 4>A country I've ever been to.</v>

785
00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:04.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you what to say this and I don't,</v>

786
00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:07.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm not shitting on America and I'm not shitting on Kanuka Candida.</v>

787
00:21:07.111 --> 00:21:07.921
<v Speaker 4>Can you guys are second.</v>

788
00:21:07.921 --> 00:21:09.510
<v Speaker 4>But Australia blows everyone.</v>

789
00:21:09.511 --> 00:21:09.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

790
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.570
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>

791
00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.460
<v Speaker 3>I love the people there.</v>

792
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.600
<v Speaker 3>I love their attitude.</v>

793
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like we,</v>

794
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.140
<v Speaker 3>we are so uptightness country,</v>

795
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:17.431
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

796
00:21:17.431 --> 00:21:19.570
<v Speaker 3>we're really so unbelievably uptight,</v>

797
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.320
<v Speaker 3>especially when it comes to like going out and having fun and relaxed.</v>

798
00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.060
<v Speaker 3>I'd moved to Australia in a fucking heartbeat in a heartbeat.</v>

799
00:21:25.061 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's this thing about America that America was sort of founded and</v>

800
00:21:29.201 --> 00:21:33.190
<v Speaker 3>created by a bunch of people that have come here from somewhere that sucked and</v>

801
00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:37.360
<v Speaker 3>they had enough and they just made it over to some new spot.</v>

802
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.870
<v Speaker 3>But I think that the,</v>

803
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.440
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

804
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:46.440
<v Speaker 3>the type of person that it takes to be able to get in a boat and travel across</v>

805
00:21:47.231 --> 00:21:49.950
<v Speaker 3>the ocean and land line is finding the land.</v>

806
00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.490
<v Speaker 3>I think it takes several,</v>

807
00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.010
<v Speaker 5>the generations before everybody fucking relaxes.</v>

808
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.630
<v Speaker 4>That's the bad ass.</v>

809
00:21:55.631 --> 00:21:59.770
<v Speaker 4>Motherfuckers that could get a boat had fucking do that because you just shook</v>

810
00:21:59.771 --> 00:21:59.981
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

811
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:00.280
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

812
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:00.701
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

813
00:22:00.701 --> 00:22:01.371
<v Speaker 4>the loose leaf.</v>

814
00:22:01.371 --> 00:22:02.530
<v Speaker 4>Scott shaking off the tree.</v>

815
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.211
<v Speaker 3>There were,</v>

816
00:22:03.211 --> 00:22:04.200
<v Speaker 3>there was so gangster,</v>

817
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.480
<v Speaker 3>they gotten a goddamn boat and traveled across.</v>

818
00:22:06.481 --> 00:22:08.110
<v Speaker 3>You ever do that ends with no radio,</v>

819
00:22:08.111 --> 00:22:08.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

820
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.290
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever think about that though?</v>

821
00:22:09.291 --> 00:22:11.570
<v Speaker 4>When you travel with your kids somewhere and then you go,</v>

822
00:22:11.571 --> 00:22:13.220
<v Speaker 4>how would we travel across America?</v>

823
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.030
<v Speaker 4>Like how would,</v>

824
00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:19.030
<v Speaker 4>how would your family size up in a wagon train going from New York to La?</v>

825
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.650
<v Speaker 3>My family would have either stayed,</v>

826
00:22:20.651 --> 00:22:21.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you had little children,</v>

827
00:22:21.911 --> 00:22:23.770
<v Speaker 3>you did stayed in Italy or Ireland,</v>

828
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.990
<v Speaker 3>you would have done whatever you could do to stay where you were.</v>

829
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:26.810
<v Speaker 3>But my,</v>

830
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:27.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

831
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.730
<v Speaker 5>Grandfather's family came over here and</v>

832
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.270
<v Speaker 5>I want to say the early 19 hundreds my grandfather's family came over from Italy</v>

833
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.420
<v Speaker 5>and my grandfather lived on a farm and he said,</v>

834
00:22:39.421 --> 00:22:42.180
<v Speaker 5>tell me stories about how they used to kill rabbits with their hand,</v>

835
00:22:42.181 --> 00:22:43.160
<v Speaker 5>like grandmother neck.</v>

836
00:22:43.161 --> 00:22:43.994
<v Speaker 5>It's snapped them.</v>

837
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.720
<v Speaker 5>That was like a normal part of your life.</v>

838
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:46.531
<v Speaker 5>And there was,</v>

839
00:22:46.531 --> 00:22:46.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

840
00:22:46.831 --> 00:22:47.710
<v Speaker 5>winters where like,</v>

841
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.180
<v Speaker 5>they would run out of the food.</v>

842
00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:50.200
<v Speaker 5>Like there was no food.</v>

843
00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.040
<v Speaker 5>They didn't have to go and borrow food from people that were neighbors.</v>

844
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.400
<v Speaker 4>Crazy times crazy.</v>

845
00:22:55.401 --> 00:22:55.611
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

846
00:22:55.611 --> 00:22:56.180
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

847
00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.430
<v Speaker 4>More crazy is like,</v>

848
00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.001
<v Speaker 4>can I say this?</v>

849
00:22:59.001 --> 00:23:00.140
<v Speaker 4>I said this guessing Lee,</v>

850
00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.840
<v Speaker 4>but like the amount of humility your grandfather must have had,</v>

851
00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:04.400
<v Speaker 4>he was a very humble guy.</v>

852
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.450
<v Speaker 4>You like to come here.</v>

853
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.610
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

854
00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:07.190
<v Speaker 5>you know I,</v>

855
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:11.420
<v Speaker 5>he got walked on by my grandmother and my grandmother was like a really strong</v>

856
00:23:11.421 --> 00:23:12.770
<v Speaker 5>woman and she used to yell at them all right.</v>

857
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:17.290
<v Speaker 3>I was like a little kid because my mom had me when she was 20 and you know,</v>

858
00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:19.330
<v Speaker 3>my mom did her best but she was really young.</v>

859
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.060
<v Speaker 3>You know when you're 20 years old and all of sudden you're raising a baby,</v>

860
00:23:22.061 --> 00:23:27.020
<v Speaker 3>that's a [inaudible] was 21 when I was born or where my,</v>

861
00:23:27.021 --> 00:23:27.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

862
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.360
<v Speaker 3>my mother was 21 rather when I was there,</v>

863
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.150
<v Speaker 3>I was 21 when I was born.</v>

864
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.950
<v Speaker 3>I might as well Ben and I would probably feel like,</v>

865
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:33.491
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

866
00:23:33.491 --> 00:23:35.950
<v Speaker 3>this bitch is 21 she doesn't know what the fuck is going on.</v>

867
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.133
<v Speaker 3>I got to get up to</v>

868
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.930
<v Speaker 4>mentality immediately.</v>

869
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:40.590
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

870
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.840
<v Speaker 3>they're all 40 they could have been,</v>

871
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:43.111
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

872
00:23:43.111 --> 00:23:43.261
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

873
00:23:43.261 --> 00:23:44.071
<v Speaker 3>At the time you were born,</v>

874
00:23:44.071 --> 00:23:44.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

875
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:45.321
<v Speaker 3>I don't know old.</v>

876
00:23:45.321 --> 00:23:45.840
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

877
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.673
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

878
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.040
<v Speaker 4>me to wrap my head around now I don't want to do the math,</v>

879
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.270
<v Speaker 4>but the point was my,</v>

880
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.841
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

881
00:23:50.841 --> 00:23:52.940
<v Speaker 4>my mother was young and so like</v>

882
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:54.850
<v Speaker 5>growing up with like,</v>

883
00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.190
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

884
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.830
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

885
00:23:55.830 --> 00:24:00.640
<v Speaker 5>a young mother that doesn't necessarily know what the fuck is going on</v>

886
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.020
<v Speaker 4>really makes you realize at a young age like,</v>

887
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.130
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>

888
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:04.830
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

889
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:05.471
<v Speaker 1>this isn't based.</v>

890
00:24:05.471 --> 00:24:07.400
<v Speaker 1>You start looking at everything a little differently.</v>

891
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.800
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know what's going on.</v>

892
00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she can make no,</v>

893
00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:14.610
<v Speaker 1>she was okay with that,</v>

894
00:24:14.611 --> 00:24:15.360
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

895
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Speaker 4>both in his fucking crazy thing together,</v>

896
00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:17.830
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

897
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:18.311
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

898
00:24:18.311 --> 00:24:19.600
<v Speaker 4>you realize like kind of early</v>

899
00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:21.003
<v Speaker 5>the fuck.</v>

900
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:22.570
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

901
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:24.070
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine being,</v>

902
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:28.240
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine that my biggest hiccup in life was getting into standup because</v>

903
00:24:28.241 --> 00:24:29.020
<v Speaker 4>by my,</v>

904
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.020
<v Speaker 4>I just that,</v>

905
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:31.330
<v Speaker 4>that I didn't,</v>

906
00:24:31.331 --> 00:24:33.400
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have any humility at that time of my life.</v>

907
00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:37.780
<v Speaker 4>And my dad gave me a speech on my 26th birthday that was like fucking</v>

908
00:24:37.781 --> 00:24:38.614
<v Speaker 4>aggressive,</v>

909
00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.010
<v Speaker 4>like really like 20 seconds.</v>

910
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:41.411
<v Speaker 4>The twenties.</v>

911
00:24:41.411 --> 00:24:42.430
<v Speaker 4>It was on my birthday.</v>

912
00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:44.110
<v Speaker 4>He called me and I thought,</v>

913
00:24:44.111 --> 00:24:45.520
<v Speaker 4>he's going to wish me happy birthday.</v>

914
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:46.511
<v Speaker 4>And he was like,</v>

915
00:24:46.511 --> 00:24:47.590
<v Speaker 4>you're a fucking loser.</v>

916
00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:48.410
<v Speaker 4>Oh my.</v>

917
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:48.671

918
00:24:48.671 --> 00:24:49.840
<v Speaker 4>you make me embarrassed.</v>

919
00:24:49.841 --> 00:24:50.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm embarrassing her,</v>

920
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.130

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:52.840

925
00:24:54.521 --> 00:24:55.291
<v Speaker 4>to have a judge said,</v>

926
00:24:55.291 --> 00:24:56.290
<v Speaker 4>I heard your son,</v>

927
00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.430
<v Speaker 4>God is life's operating by raw Oliver stone and he's in New York turned</v>

928
00:24:59.460 --> 00:24:59.680
<v Speaker 4>standard.</v>

929
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.400
<v Speaker 4>How's he doing?</v>

930
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.110
<v Speaker 4>Cause I lied in fucking court.</v>

931
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:02.420
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

932
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.520
<v Speaker 4>it makes me sick to my stomach.</v>

933
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.181
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

934
00:25:04.181 --> 00:25:04.901
<v Speaker 4>what can I do different?</v>

935
00:25:04.901 --> 00:25:05.200
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

936
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.033
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

937
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.533
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

938
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:07.900
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

939
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:08.651
<v Speaker 4>can I fix this?</v>

940
00:25:08.651 --> 00:25:08.951
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

941
00:25:08.951 --> 00:25:10.330
<v Speaker 4>I know I failed you as a father.</v>

942
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:11.830
<v Speaker 4>And I know it.</v>

943
00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.030
<v Speaker 4>It got me to like,</v>

944
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.140
<v Speaker 4>it changed my life.</v>

945
00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:14.980
<v Speaker 4>Like I went,</v>

946
00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.980
<v Speaker 4>he taught me how to get taught me how to be humble enough to get a job in</v>

947
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.990
<v Speaker 4>standup because I,</v>

948
00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.120
<v Speaker 4>you just needed to work the door.</v>

949
00:25:22.121 --> 00:25:23.230
<v Speaker 4>But I thought I was above that.</v>

950
00:25:23.231 --> 00:25:24.670
<v Speaker 4>I thought that I was better than that.</v>

951
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.280
<v Speaker 4>Like I thought that someone would just grab me and put me on stage and I'd be</v>

952
00:25:27.281 --> 00:25:27.880
<v Speaker 4>discovered.</v>

953
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.960
<v Speaker 4>That's how I thought it happened.</v>

954
00:25:28.961 --> 00:25:29.201
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know.</v>

955
00:25:29.201 --> 00:25:31.960
<v Speaker 4>You could literally be humble and say,</v>

956
00:25:31.961 --> 00:25:32.771
<v Speaker 4>I want to do this.</v>

957
00:25:32.771 --> 00:25:33.850
<v Speaker 4>How do I go about doing this?</v>

958
00:25:33.851 --> 00:25:35.530
<v Speaker 4>Please help me test someone.</v>

959
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:41.190
<v Speaker 4>And he got me into it and literally fucking started doing it the next night and</v>

960
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.990
<v Speaker 4>six months later I had a deal and it was like,</v>

961
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.400
<v Speaker 4>it was a fucking,</v>

962
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.170
<v Speaker 4>one of the greatest things I ever did.</v>

963
00:25:47.171 --> 00:25:48.430
<v Speaker 4>I look back at that so fondly.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Just throw him in there.</v>

974

<v Speaker 1>I started getting into a tough crowd mentality.</v>

976
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I started living off the credits of tough crowd.</v>

1072
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:43.070

1073
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.860
<v Speaker 4>but nick said that he was getting heckled by this girl and uh,</v>

1074
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:50.180

1080
00:28:58.391 --> 00:29:00.940
<v Speaker 4>I've never had an entire crowd hate me more.</v>

1081
00:29:00.941 --> 00:29:03.950
<v Speaker 4>And they had to escort him to the green room,</v>

1082
00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.280
<v Speaker 4>but he's a fucking liar.</v>

1083
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:07.450

1090
00:29:15.971 --> 00:29:16.960
<v Speaker 4>They figured out who I am,</v>

1091
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.250
<v Speaker 4>they'll Google me and they'll go,</v>

1099
00:29:29.441 --> 00:29:29.890

1110
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:44.470
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing the road and I would,</v>

1111
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.300
<v Speaker 4>and I knew a lot of those guys.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Most of those guys from doing standard strategy that shows canceled.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1119
00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:57.620
<v Speaker 3>it was easy to get comedians.</v>

1120
00:29:57.621 --> 00:29:58.880
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wanted to be on it.</v>

1121
00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:00.110
<v Speaker 3>It was very entertaining.</v>

1122
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.100
<v Speaker 4>We'll get to talking to him like it's pretty much a podcast.</v>

1123
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:04.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1124
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:05.323
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't fun.</v>

1125
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:06.830
<v Speaker 4>It was a limited</v>

1126

<v Speaker 3>like time,</v>

1127
00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.410

<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>

1130
00:30:10.671 --> 00:30:15.671
<v Speaker 3>we're so lucky that we are existing in this time where you can do this thing</v>

1131
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.170
<v Speaker 3>where you could do whatever the fuck you want.</v>

1132
00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.640
<v Speaker 3>No one's telling us what to do.</v>

1133
00:30:19.641 --> 00:30:20.480
<v Speaker 3>We're doing whenever we want.</v>

1134
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:21.650
<v Speaker 3>We decided to keep going.</v>

1135
00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.240
<v Speaker 3>We decided to end the podcast,</v>

1136
00:30:23.241 --> 00:30:24.320
<v Speaker 3>take a leak and keep going.</v>

1137
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.030
<v Speaker 3>There's no producers is don't.</v>

1138
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.540
<v Speaker 3>That's the beauty of a situation.</v>

1139
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:29.941
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1140
00:30:29.941 --> 00:30:34.410
<v Speaker 4>this is when Greg Giraldo and Denis leary hit pause for a second.</v>

1141
00:30:34.411 --> 00:30:35.070
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>

1142
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.960
<v Speaker 4>this is a funny,</v>

1143
00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.260
<v Speaker 4>or keep it all your money story,</v>

1144
00:30:37.261 --> 00:30:40.320
<v Speaker 4>because Geraldo never even went to the nuclear weapons,</v>

1145
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:41.410
<v Speaker 4>which is plagiarism.</v>

1146
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.510
<v Speaker 4>He never went to that.</v>

1147
00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.370
<v Speaker 4>He never even went to that.</v>

1148
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:46.800
<v Speaker 4>But Larry was so conti with them.</v>

1149
00:30:46.801 --> 00:30:48.180
<v Speaker 4>Like right off the bat,</v>

1150
00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:51.540
<v Speaker 4>Greg Giraldo was a buck and beautiful dude.</v>

1151
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.780
<v Speaker 4>He was just the nicest fucking guy.</v>

1152
00:30:54.781 --> 00:30:56.240
<v Speaker 4>He was very intelligent in a,</v>

1153
00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:56.580
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

1154
00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.490
<v Speaker 4>in a time where in my life when no one needed to be nice to me.</v>

1155
00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.400
<v Speaker 4>There were two people that were distinctly nice to me and,</v>

1156
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.721
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1157
00:31:02.721 --> 00:31:04.800
<v Speaker 4>and gentle and that was bill burr.</v>

1158
00:31:04.801 --> 00:31:06.360
<v Speaker 4>And Greg Geraldo like,</v>

1159
00:31:06.361 --> 00:31:06.571
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1160
00:31:06.571 --> 00:31:07.080
<v Speaker 4>Norton and,</v>

1161
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:07.211
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1162
00:31:07.211 --> 00:31:08.940
<v Speaker 4>and Bobby and all those guys were always nice to me.</v>

1163
00:31:08.941 --> 00:31:09.750
<v Speaker 4>But man,</v>

<v Speaker 4>pulled me aside and like they were fucking great guys.</v>

1166
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.580
<v Speaker 4>I remember one time calling in to my buddy cowhead show,</v>

1167
00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:18.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1169
00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:22.920
<v Speaker 4>and cause Geraldo was on and calling in to listen to Geraldo's interview cause I</v>

1170
00:31:22.921 --> 00:31:23.970
<v Speaker 4>just love Greg.</v>

1173
00:31:27.631 --> 00:31:31.890
<v Speaker 4>And I talked to Greg for like fucking 10 minutes in between the break in a song</v>

1174
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:32.761
<v Speaker 4>and just was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fucking fucking great guy.</v>

1182
00:31:37.681 --> 00:31:38.790
<v Speaker 4>He had a show,</v>

1183
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what network it was on,</v>

1184
00:31:40.681 --> 00:31:41.131
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>

1185
00:31:41.131 --> 00:31:41.640
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.120
<v Speaker 4>It was on during when yours was right?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1189
00:31:45.461 --> 00:31:45.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.750
<v Speaker 4>He talked about partying with the girl that was on your show.</v>

1191
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.570
<v Speaker 4>Which one?</v>

1192
00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:49.830
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1193
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.600
<v Speaker 4>the girl with the big tits.</v>

1194
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.750
<v Speaker 4>Who on newsradio girls are they tense?</v>

1195
00:31:54.751 --> 00:31:56.070
<v Speaker 4>Did Not one girl with big tits?</v>

1196
00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:56.841
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1197
00:31:56.841 --> 00:31:57.330
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1198
00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:57.931
<v Speaker 4>Who was the girl?</v>

1199
00:31:57.931 --> 00:31:59.460
<v Speaker 4>And there was beautiful girls,</v>

1200
00:31:59.461 --> 00:32:00.600
<v Speaker 4>but then I always</v>

1201
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:02.830
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

1202
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.510
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1203
00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:05.470
<v Speaker 4>I thought her tits were so big they had to tape them on.</v>

1204
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:09.240
<v Speaker 4>Maura was the white girl with black hair.</v>

1205
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:09.451
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1206
00:32:09.451 --> 00:32:10.200
<v Speaker 4>she was though.</v>

1207
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.370
<v Speaker 4>That's a really,</v>

1208
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:14.580
<v Speaker 4>that's a terrible misunderstanding.</v>

1209
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.713
<v Speaker 4>She was beautiful.</v>

1210
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.200
<v Speaker 4>She was very beautiful and incredibly town home.</v>

1211
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.010
<v Speaker 4>Fucking one incredibly town with white wine with her.</v>

1212
00:32:20.011 --> 00:32:20.844
<v Speaker 4>So bad.</v>

1213
00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:22.190
<v Speaker 3>I did a scene with her once,</v>

1214
00:32:22.191 --> 00:32:25.640
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget this and I told her and she just sort of laughed it off</v>

1215
00:32:25.641 --> 00:32:26.474
<v Speaker 3>because she's,</v>

1216
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:28.370
<v Speaker 3>she's like really?</v>

1217
00:32:28.371 --> 00:32:30.230
<v Speaker 3>Like she wasn't,</v>

1218
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.860
<v Speaker 3>she would never like brag about her talent as an actor.</v>

1219
00:32:34.861 --> 00:32:35.694
<v Speaker 3>And he was good,</v>

1220
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:38.120
<v Speaker 3>but we did a scene together and um,</v>

1221
00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.370
<v Speaker 3>I didn't that she was acting,</v>

1222
00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 3>I thought she was saying something to me and I was like,</v>

1223
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.521
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1224
00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:44.270
<v Speaker 3>that's the words.</v>

1225
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:44.421
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1226
00:32:44.421 --> 00:32:45.254
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1227
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:45.531
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1228
00:32:45.531 --> 00:32:46.101
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1229
00:32:46.101 --> 00:32:47.090
<v Speaker 3>You bad ass bitch.</v>

1230
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:47.960
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1231
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.280
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know you were acting.</v>

1232
00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:49.591
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1233
00:32:49.591 --> 00:32:51.230
<v Speaker 3>you just fucking rocked me.</v>

1234
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Like she rocked me with what she was saying because the set of news radio was</v>

1235
00:32:55.221 --> 00:32:56.150
<v Speaker 3>very loose.</v>

1236
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:57.860
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of fucking off.</v>

1237
00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:02.030
<v Speaker 3>And there was also a lot of improvisation where it's like Dave Foley was</v>

1238
00:33:02.031 --> 00:33:05.810
<v Speaker 3>responsible for a huge amount of like what got on the air,</v>

1239
00:33:05.811 --> 00:33:06.231
<v Speaker 3>that show,</v>

1240
00:33:06.231 --> 00:33:07.220
<v Speaker 3>because it's sort of like,</v>

1241
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.560
<v Speaker 3>he was like sort of like a almost like a secret producer.</v>

1242
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:13.100
<v Speaker 3>And it was because the guys who wrote the show where like they were so open</v>

1243
00:33:13.101 --> 00:33:15.950
<v Speaker 3>minded and so smart and Paul Simms,</v>

1244
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.690
<v Speaker 3>who is the executive producer was just,</v>

1245
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:22.190
<v Speaker 3>it's really brilliant guy who recognized that there was a lot of people like AMD</v>

1246
00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:27.191
<v Speaker 3>or like Phil Hartman or Dave Foley or whatever who would have this in intuition</v>

1247
00:33:27.921 --> 00:33:31.310
<v Speaker 3>while they were on stage working out the scenes and they would come up with new</v>

1248
00:33:31.311 --> 00:33:32.990
<v Speaker 3>things and to incorporate those new things.</v>

1249
00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:37.280
<v Speaker 3>So Dave was like constantly tweaking things and adding things and it was,</v>

1250
00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:37.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1251
00:33:37.791 --> 00:33:41.240
<v Speaker 3>and being able to watch that and to watch someone do that and to be in that</v>

1252
00:33:41.241 --> 00:33:41.811
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

1253
00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:42.200
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1254
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.033
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1255
00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:43.520
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1256
00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.190
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1257
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:44.580
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1258
00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.300
<v Speaker 3>this is like an ideal situation.</v>

1259
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:47.991
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1260
00:33:47.991 --> 00:33:48.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1261
00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:48.770

1262
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:49.603
<v Speaker 4>I was the,</v>

1263
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:53.060
<v Speaker 4>is this is gonna Sound Conti Conti but weird.</v>

1264
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:53.721
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1265
00:33:53.721 --> 00:33:54.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1266
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:59.020
<v Speaker 4>so like last year was a very good year for me and I'm also in the middle of our,</v>

1267
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:00.630
<v Speaker 4>our school.</v>

1268
00:34:00.631 --> 00:34:02.610
<v Speaker 4>So like our kids are in third grade and,</v>

1269
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.360
<v Speaker 4>and like now we've been at school long enough to kind of work and we know all</v>

1270
00:34:05.361 --> 00:34:07.670
<v Speaker 4>the parents and so like I was this like a,</v>

1271
00:34:07.671 --> 00:34:11.810
<v Speaker 4>I was the resident famous comedian parent.</v>

1272
00:34:11.811 --> 00:34:11.931
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>he's a comedian.</v>

1275
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.200
<v Speaker 4>I think Dave Foley's kids go to our school now and Dave Foley,</v>

1276
00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:16.521
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>

1277
00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:17.660
<v Speaker 4>have you heard Dave Foley?</v>

1278
00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.580
<v Speaker 4>He spoke at a PTA.</v>

1279
00:34:19.581 --> 00:34:21.830
<v Speaker 4>Mom apparently is a fucking amazing dad.</v>

1280
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:24.710
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm either that or it's a guy that looks like Dave Foley.</v>

1281
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.690
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean he's amazing dad?</v>

1282
00:34:26.691 --> 00:34:29.810
<v Speaker 4>Like he like shows up and does all the shifts and,</v>

1283
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:30.830
<v Speaker 4>and they were like,</v>

1394
00:36:54.881 --> 00:36:56.200

1395
00:36:56.201 --> 00:36:58.660
<v Speaker 4>which is all about depression and stuff like that.</v>

1396
00:36:58.661 --> 00:36:59.830
<v Speaker 4>It's a documentary on Netflix.</v>

1397

<v Speaker 4>It's all right.</v>

1399
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:05.320
<v Speaker 4>But there was a guy in the movie that was like a motivational speaker to kids</v>

1400
00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:06.281
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

1403
00:37:08.471 --> 00:37:09.350
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen this guy.</v>

1404
00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:10.240
<v Speaker 4>Never in my life.</v>

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.130
<v Speaker 3>we did that.</v>

1450
00:38:32.131 --> 00:38:33.330
<v Speaker 3>A movie together.</v>

1451

1452
00:38:34.741 --> 00:38:39.180
<v Speaker 3>the Kevin movie and Lenny Clarke was in that movie because it was shot in Boston</v>

1453
00:38:39.181 --> 00:38:41.220
<v Speaker 3>and Lenny played a local Boston guy,</v>

1454
00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:42.750
<v Speaker 3>Lenny Clarke,</v>

1455
00:38:42.751 --> 00:38:44.460
<v Speaker 3>which I fucking love that guy,</v>

1456
00:38:44.461 --> 00:38:46.650
<v Speaker 3>but he's lost a lot of weight man.</v>

1457
00:38:46.651 --> 00:38:48.570
<v Speaker 3>He lost a ton of where he looks great.</v>

1458
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's like really lean.</v>

1459
00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:50.994
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have a,</v>

1460
00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:51.931
<v Speaker 3>I've got it.</v>

1461
00:38:51.931 --> 00:38:52.764
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1462
00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:57.010
<v Speaker 6>Dalia guy gotta work right</v>

1463
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.140
<v Speaker 6>for reasonable price.</v>

1464
00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:04.131
<v Speaker 6>And I could come back,</v>

1465
00:39:04.131 --> 00:39:06.000
<v Speaker 6>we get out of a piece and like they did an,</v>

1466
00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:09.640
<v Speaker 1>is this where they might find out?</v>

1467
00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:10.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1468
00:39:10.041 --> 00:39:10.370
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1469
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.670
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1470
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:11.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1471
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:11.781
<v Speaker 1>it's about the time,</v>

1472
00:39:11.781 --> 00:39:12.614
<v Speaker 1>I think right here.</v>

1473
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:14.223
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1474
00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:15.431
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1475
00:39:15.431 --> 00:39:15.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1476
00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1477
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:17.270
<v Speaker 1>what happened to lap Denis leary?</v>

1478
00:39:17.271 --> 00:39:18.340
<v Speaker 1>He gets mad at Greg.</v>

1479
00:39:18.341 --> 00:39:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Geraldo has prepared material.</v>

1480
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:21.910
<v Speaker 1>It's really hilarious.</v>

1481
00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.010
<v Speaker 6>And that's how he found out where they were buried the ball.</v>

1482
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.330
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1483
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:26.163
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

1484
00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Is it during the Dukes of Hazzard?</v>

1485
00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:31.190
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1486
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:36.190
<v Speaker 1>someone should find this off air and figure it out because it's a really good</v>

1487
00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:37.723
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

1488
00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:40.080
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1489
00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.610
<v Speaker 6>there might be their outcome for a,</v>

1490
00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:43.850
<v Speaker 6>what is a nonviolent way to,</v>

1491
00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:45.650
<v Speaker 6>to solve the problem with the copy that we hate,</v>

1492
00:39:45.651 --> 00:39:46.970
<v Speaker 6>that hate dozens got weapons pointed this?</v>

1493
00:39:46.971 --> 00:39:47.660
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>

1494
00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:47.781
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1495
00:39:47.781 --> 00:39:48.081
<v Speaker 6>you're right.</v>

1496
00:39:48.081 --> 00:39:49.010
<v Speaker 6>Like Russia for example,</v>

1497
00:39:49.011 --> 00:39:49.940
<v Speaker 6>that big Russian war.</v>

1498
00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:51.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1499
00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:52.980
<v Speaker 6>There are things that,</v>

1500
00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:54.710
<v Speaker 6>there are things that are</v>

1501
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:57.143
<v Speaker 1>absolutely,</v>

1502
00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:00.570
<v Speaker 6>but there our approach to their economic benefit that we're giving them in order</v>

1503
00:40:00.571 --> 00:40:00.691
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

1504
00:40:00.691 --> 00:40:02.490
<v Speaker 6>for them to stop developing their weapons.</v>

1505
00:40:02.491 --> 00:40:02.940
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1506
00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.380
<v Speaker 6>I heard weekly they agree to stop,</v>

1507
00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:04.920
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1508
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.850
<v Speaker 6>stop building nuke.</v>

1509
00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.890
<v Speaker 6>If American women agree to get their nails done,</v>

1510
00:40:07.891 --> 00:40:08.724
<v Speaker 6>at least twice a week.</v>

1511
00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.930
<v Speaker 6>I ran a good boy.</v>

1512
00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:12.550
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>

1513
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:14.220
<v Speaker 6>you can make so many jokes before the show.</v>

1514
00:40:14.221 --> 00:40:15.054
<v Speaker 6>It's not even applying.</v>

1515
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.140
<v Speaker 6>Unbelievable.</v>

1516
00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:16.771
<v Speaker 6>He's got to,</v>

1517
00:40:16.771 --> 00:40:17.890
<v Speaker 6>he's got pocket follow.</v>

1518
00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.930
<v Speaker 6>Not Good.</v>

1519
00:40:20.931 --> 00:40:21.580
<v Speaker 6>I'm just saying.</v>

1520
00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.210
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1521
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:22.480
<v Speaker 6>I'll have,</v>

1522
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.430
<v Speaker 6>it was my dad.</v>

1523
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.540
<v Speaker 6>That's kind of what we do here.</v>

1524
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.713
<v Speaker 6>A comedy writer.</v>

1525
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:28.653
<v Speaker 6>Oh boy.</v>

1526
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:34.690
<v Speaker 6>The guy who did all the homework and then after there was any more that needed</v>

1527
00:40:34.691 --> 00:40:35.524
<v Speaker 6>to be done.</v>

1528
00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.270
<v Speaker 6>That's a good point.</v>

1529
00:40:37.271 --> 00:40:37.891
<v Speaker 6>And if you would try it,</v>

1530
00:40:37.891 --> 00:40:38.681
<v Speaker 6>a little comedy writing,</v>

1531
00:40:38.681 --> 00:40:39.940
<v Speaker 6>maybe your show and still be on the air.</v>

1532
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.790
<v Speaker 6>Can you tell me all the time</v>

1533
00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.880
<v Speaker 1>he just crushed it,</v>

1534
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:54.780
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1535
00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:55.613
<v Speaker 1>But that's</v>

1536
00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.370
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] happens when dudes get famous.</v>

1537
00:40:57.371 --> 00:40:59.290
<v Speaker 3>I think you guy can't come along and clown.</v>

1538
00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.133
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

1539
00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.091
<v Speaker 1>tell me about it.</v>

1540
00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:03.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a first time I went on the road and I realize there are killers that I've</v>

1541
00:41:03.911 --> 00:41:04.511
<v Speaker 1>never heard of.</v>

1542
00:41:04.511 --> 00:41:05.150
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1543
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:07.410
<v Speaker 3>When a guy gets famous to a point where you're uh,</v>

1544
00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:07.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1545
00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.590
<v Speaker 3>Tom Cruise or any,</v>

1546
00:41:09.591 --> 00:41:09.891
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

1547
00:41:09.891 --> 00:41:11.170
<v Speaker 3>any sort of a person who's been in moving.</v>

1548
00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:11.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1549
00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:12.350
<v Speaker 3>Dennis Leary,</v>

1550
00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:15.110
<v Speaker 3>when that came out and had been in a ton of movies,</v>

1551
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.670
<v Speaker 3>he had been in some really high profile movies.</v>

1552
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:22.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean he thought of himself as a guy who had made it so I think he probably</v>

1553
00:41:22.131 --> 00:41:24.980
<v Speaker 3>assumed he was going to get a certain level of respect.</v>

1554
00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:25.993
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1555
00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:30.410
<v Speaker 3>maybe if you did a little writing your show would still be on the air.</v>

1556
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.140
<v Speaker 3>That was like a nuclear weapon that he didn't see common.</v>

1557
00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:33.901
<v Speaker 3>He didn't see that.</v>

1558
00:41:33.901 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 3>Tell</v>

1559
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.730
<v Speaker 4>me that all you got detonated is that,</v>

1560
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:40.560
<v Speaker 4>oh for that was Hubris.</v>

1561
00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:43.920
<v Speaker 4>You look at the look on journalists face and you can see his eyes twitching and</v>

1562
00:41:43.921 --> 00:41:47.820
<v Speaker 4>you can see him go angry going three,</v>

1563
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:48.271
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>

1564
00:41:48.271 --> 00:41:48.811
<v Speaker 4>I got this,</v>

1565
00:41:48.811 --> 00:41:51.740
<v Speaker 4>I got this and then like making is making it as tactical colonists had.</v>

1566
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.280
<v Speaker 4>You could see that happening almost.</v>

1567
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:54.870
<v Speaker 3>It's a superior mind,</v>

1568
00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.030
<v Speaker 3>superior mind,</v>

1569
00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.550
<v Speaker 3>just not as famous but a superior product.</v>

1570
00:41:59.551 --> 00:42:00.241
<v Speaker 3>Like what he would,</v>

1571
00:42:00.241 --> 00:42:01.350
<v Speaker 3>he would put out his points of view,</v>

1572
00:42:01.351 --> 00:42:02.184
<v Speaker 3>it'd be superior.</v>

1573
00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.031
<v Speaker 3>I'll watch his hour.</v>

1574
00:42:03.031 --> 00:42:05.930
<v Speaker 3>I got the idea that there would be like something funny and sign it.</v>

1575
00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.940
<v Speaker 3>Someone prepared like look at him.</v>

1576
00:42:07.941 --> 00:42:09.150
<v Speaker 3>He for being a bully.</v>

1577
00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:10.500
<v Speaker 3>But that's the idea.</v>

1578
00:42:10.501 --> 00:42:11.340
<v Speaker 3>That was ridiculous.</v>

1579
00:42:11.341 --> 00:42:13.170
<v Speaker 3>Like it's so crazy like,</v>

1580
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.160
<v Speaker 3>oh look at the painter.</v>

1581
00:42:14.161 --> 00:42:15.120
<v Speaker 3>He went and painted</v>

1582
00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:15.760
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1583
00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:16.700
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

1584
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.130
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

1585
00:42:18.131 --> 00:42:18.521
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

1586
00:42:18.521 --> 00:42:20.050
<v Speaker 4>there's a certain personality that,</v>

1587
00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.490
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not going to speak,</v>

1588
00:42:21.491 --> 00:42:21.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1589
00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:22.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying this is Denis leary,</v>

1590
00:42:22.961 --> 00:42:27.700
<v Speaker 4>but there is certain personality that's so arrogant in that the way I say it</v>

1591
00:42:27.701 --> 00:42:30.010
<v Speaker 4>will be so much better than the way you say it,</v>

1592
00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.620
<v Speaker 4>as opposed to what I say is better than what you say.</v>

1593
00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:33.430
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

1594
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:35.740
<v Speaker 4>like you could hear the statement before him when he says,</v>

1595
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:36.560
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1596
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.920
<v Speaker 4>well we're going to go to war with a country like the,</v>

1597
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:40.210
<v Speaker 4>it was very arrogant and he was like,</v>

1598
00:42:40.211 --> 00:42:40.340
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1599
00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.910
<v Speaker 4>like that great Russian war that does fucking work.</v>

1600
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:44.800
<v Speaker 4>You're not listen to the words you're,</v>

1601
00:42:44.801 --> 00:42:45.041
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1602
00:42:45.041 --> 00:42:46.600
<v Speaker 4>you're overlooking the thought.</v>

1603
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1604
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:52.550
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't this idea that somehow or another he's going to be able to solve what</v>

1605
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:57.640
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of scholars and heads of states and diplomats and emissary workers and</v>

1606
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:01.130
<v Speaker 3>no one can solve.</v>

1607
00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:01.761
<v Speaker 3>No one can solve.</v>

1608
00:43:01.761 --> 00:43:04.740
<v Speaker 3>But he's going to come along and tell you exactly how things need to be blunt.</v>

1609
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:07.820
<v Speaker 3>The ideas of,</v>

1610
00:43:07.821 --> 00:43:08.654
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1611
00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:12.080
<v Speaker 3>the communication between nations where they don't even speak the same fucking</v>

1612
00:43:12.081 --> 00:43:12.690
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>

1613
00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:12.931
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1614
00:43:12.931 --> 00:43:14.300
<v Speaker 3>And how difficult that shit is.</v>

1615
00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:19.570
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking hard just to understand things and cultural context and explain</v>

1616
00:43:21.531 --> 00:43:24.470
<v Speaker 3>those different people that are in your country that you're sort of</v>

1617
00:43:24.471 --> 00:43:25.304
<v Speaker 3>representing.</v>

1618
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.490
<v Speaker 3>Because Koreans are not like Americans and Americans and all I Koreans,</v>

1619
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:31.730
<v Speaker 3>people that live in North Korea do not understand how we're living in North</v>

1620
00:43:31.731 --> 00:43:34.160
<v Speaker 3>America and the people in North America for the most part,</v>

1621
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:37.670
<v Speaker 3>really a fairly ignorant about what the fuck is going on in North Korea.</v>

1622
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:40.910
<v Speaker 3>And one of the big reasons is because we can't fuck them communicate with each</v>

1623
00:43:40.911 --> 00:43:41.420
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

1624
00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.860
<v Speaker 3>If we could communicate with each other,</v>

1625
00:43:42.861 --> 00:43:47.861
<v Speaker 3>if everybody in Korean and North Korea knew how to speak English and they all</v>

1626
00:43:48.021 --> 00:43:51.140
<v Speaker 3>could read the shit on the Internet about how the world is run and what the fuck</v>

1627
00:43:51.141 --> 00:43:53.930
<v Speaker 3>is really going on in the country and how the rest of the world views things,</v>

1628
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.170
<v Speaker 3>they would probably slowly but surely take action.</v>

1629
00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:01.700
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that there they're separate from the rest of the world,</v>

1630
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.070
<v Speaker 3>in fact they speak this one,</v>

1631
00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:04.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1632
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.440
<v Speaker 3>very unique sort of a language.</v>

1633
00:44:06.441 --> 00:44:11.000
<v Speaker 3>It's difficult to learn and he's in translatable very easily to English or</v>

1634
00:44:11.001 --> 00:44:11.930
<v Speaker 3>Spanish or</v>

1635
00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:12.751
<v Speaker 4>there's Korean.</v>

1636
00:44:12.751 --> 00:44:14.520
<v Speaker 4>Not translatable is difficult</v>

1637
00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.040
<v Speaker 3>symbol.</v>

1638
00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:17.431
<v Speaker 3>You know the,</v>

1639
00:44:17.431 --> 00:44:17.601
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1640
00:44:17.601 --> 00:44:17.881
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1641
00:44:17.881 --> 00:44:18.840
<v Speaker 3>the way things are written,</v>

1642
00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.400
<v Speaker 4>we're good friends are Korean and that when you go to a car,</v>

1643
00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:22.470
<v Speaker 4>we went to a Korean barbecue.</v>

1644
00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:23.281
<v Speaker 4>It was Roy Choi.</v>

1645
00:44:23.281 --> 00:44:24.900
<v Speaker 4>He's the guy that started the Taco truck.</v>

1646
00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:26.100
<v Speaker 4>The concept of the TACO truck.</v>

1647
00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:26.963
<v Speaker 4>It's him.</v>

1648
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.671
<v Speaker 4>He started,</v>

1649
00:44:27.671 --> 00:44:28.330
<v Speaker 4>it started.</v>

1650
00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:29.430
<v Speaker 4>It was the first guy,</v>

1651
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.530
<v Speaker 4>the premise of these correlation,</v>

1652
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:33.180
<v Speaker 4>these gourmet taco trucks.</v>

1653
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:33.730
<v Speaker 4>He's Asian.</v>

1654
00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:34.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1655
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.153
<v Speaker 4>Roy Choi.</v>

1656
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.121
<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>

1657
00:44:36.121 --> 00:44:39.030
<v Speaker 4>He's good friends with Bordain Asians don't give a fuck dude.</v>

1658
00:44:39.031 --> 00:44:39.900
<v Speaker 4>Then you get things done.</v>

1659
00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.351
<v Speaker 4>They get things done.</v>

1660
00:44:41.351 --> 00:44:43.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they really get it done.</v>

1661
00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:45.090
<v Speaker 4>If I can get things done,</v>

1662
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:48.870
<v Speaker 4>they really do the fucking future of America.</v>

1663
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:50.213
<v Speaker 4>When you eat,</v>

1664
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.950
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck did they ever figure out how to get,</v>

1665
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:56.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what you've said yet.</v>

1666
00:44:56.090 --> 00:44:56.690
<v Speaker 3>Full.</v>

1667
00:44:56.690 --> 00:45:01.690
<v Speaker 3>A full like strangle hold on the manufacturer of like electronic parts and TV's</v>

1668
00:45:06.851 --> 00:45:07.470
<v Speaker 3>and lab</v>

1669
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:08.303
<v Speaker 4>cars.</v>

1670
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.061
<v Speaker 4>Cars,</v>

1671
00:45:09.061 --> 00:45:10.050
<v Speaker 4>cars are over there now.</v>

1672
00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.490
<v Speaker 4>They're going to wear in Detroit.</v>

1673
00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:13.140
<v Speaker 4>No one's doing cars in Detroit.</v>

1674
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:13.711
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1675
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:15.990
<v Speaker 4>isn't Chrysler stolen to Detroit and hasn't forward?</v>

1676
00:45:15.991 --> 00:45:16.291
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1677
00:45:16.291 --> 00:45:17.430
<v Speaker 4>but no one's in Detroit.</v>

1678
00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:21.780
<v Speaker 4>Detroit's apparently imperil because everyone took their business to Asia.</v>

1679
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:22.550
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1680
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.750
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1681
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:23.221
<v Speaker 4>it's more,</v>

1682
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:23.791
<v Speaker 4>is it more,</v>

1683
00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:24.750
<v Speaker 4>is it more a,</v>

1684
00:45:24.751 --> 00:45:28.260
<v Speaker 4>an idiocracy not idiocracy a theocracy,</v>

1685
00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:29.160
<v Speaker 4>not theocracy.</v>

1686
00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.060
<v Speaker 4>What's worth looking for?</v>

1687
00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.530
<v Speaker 4>Any is a accuracy.</v>

1688
00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:32.940
<v Speaker 4>What do you,</v>

1689
00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.750
<v Speaker 4>what are you trying to where like where it's like the idea of the state is</v>

1690
00:45:36.751 --> 00:45:37.740
<v Speaker 4>better than the person.</v>

1691
00:45:37.741 --> 00:45:42.450
<v Speaker 4>So everyone looks up to the state and it's something like that where they care</v>

1692
00:45:42.451 --> 00:45:43.231
<v Speaker 4>about their job.</v>

1693
00:45:43.231 --> 00:45:44.490
<v Speaker 4>Like Americans just don't care.</v>

1694
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:45.301
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1695
00:45:45.301 --> 00:45:50.301
<v Speaker 3>you know what happened is first of all the cars they made sucked that that</v>

1696
00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:51.880
<v Speaker 3>happened in American.</v>

1697
00:45:51.881 --> 00:45:52.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:54.180
<v Speaker 3>We have to,</v>

1700
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.990
<v Speaker 4>there was a period where we got really lazy.</v>

1701
00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:01.020
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck went wrong from like 1973 the Ford Tempo and 90 fucking Ford tempo</v>

<v Speaker 3>What the fuck happened to the Mustang?</v>

1707
00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:16.530
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:20.230
<v Speaker 3>I can say this,</v>

1710
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:21.310
<v Speaker 3>I have a Mustang today.</v>

1711
00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.160
<v Speaker 3>I have a Shelby gt 500 and I fucking love it.</v>

1712
00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:24.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1713
00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:29.910

<v Speaker 3>Really like to 69 but then something happened and like the 70s and the 80s like</v>

1716
00:46:40.751 --> 00:46:43.690
<v Speaker 3>you call that up fucking Mustang.</v>

1719
00:46:52.361 --> 00:46:55.480
<v Speaker 3>the designers by gunpoint and gay up all the drawings.</v>

1720
00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:55.891
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

00:46:56.651 --> 00:46:59.330
<v Speaker 3>Do you call that by the way I spelled gay.</v>

1723
00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:02.800
<v Speaker 3>G H e y them gave them Joe homosexuals</v>

1724
00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:03.070
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1725
00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:03.380
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1726
00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:04.860
<v Speaker 4>cause I wonder if it was a,</v>

1727
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:06.520
<v Speaker 4>it had to do with homosexuality and the,</v>

1728
00:47:06.521 --> 00:47:07.840
<v Speaker 4>and the fear of homophobia.</v>

1729
00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:11.230
<v Speaker 4>And they took all these great gay designers that were super closeted in the</v>

1730
00:47:11.231 --> 00:47:12.230
<v Speaker 4>fifties and then got,</v>

1731
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.500
<v Speaker 4>and then there was this manliness and they disappeared.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We were very close to a sign.</v>

1820
00:49:36.851 --> 00:49:37.780
<v Speaker 3>I can't say with WHO.</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1825
00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.690
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it is based in the podcast.</v>

1826
00:49:43.691 --> 00:49:44.320
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>

1827
00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:45.180

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1830
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:49.340
<v Speaker 4>this person said that they got a new phone number.</v>

1831
00:49:49.341 --> 00:49:49.641
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

1832
00:49:49.641 --> 00:49:50.001
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

1833
00:49:50.001 --> 00:49:51.620
<v Speaker 4>I got a new phone number and I thought they were lying,</v>

1834
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:53.210
<v Speaker 4>but now they're sending me pictures of this.</v>

1835
00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.050
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>

1836
00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:54.500
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

1837
00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:55.333
<v Speaker 4>who is that?</v>

1838
00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.300
<v Speaker 4>It's an Aussie.</v>

1839
00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.080
<v Speaker 4>Is that Kadafi?</v>

1840
00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:57.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1841
00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:57.681
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

1842
00:49:57.681 --> 00:49:59.720
<v Speaker 4>so might be not the person I'm thinking of it.</v>

1843
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.580
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1844
00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.210
<v Speaker 4>You getting someone sending you a murder?</v>

1845
00:50:02.211 --> 00:50:03.044
<v Speaker 4>The people.</v>

1846
00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:04.520
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>

1847
00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.530
<v Speaker 4>What's a new TV show you're doing?</v>

1848
00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:06.001
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1849
00:50:06.001 --> 00:50:06.630
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

1850
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:10.290
<v Speaker 3>it's based a lot of it on his like controversial subjects and a lot of it,</v>

1851
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.610
<v Speaker 3>it'll be all of it.</v>

1852
00:50:11.611 --> 00:50:13.200
<v Speaker 3>We'll start off from the podcast,</v>

1853
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:15.470
<v Speaker 3>like examining all sorts of different ways.</v>

1854
00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:16.360
<v Speaker 3>There's no tenant,</v>

1855
00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:16.770
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1856
00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:17.820
<v Speaker 3>we sort of have a tentative title,</v>

1857
00:50:17.821 --> 00:50:19.170
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not necessarily happy with it.</v>

1858
00:50:19.171 --> 00:50:23.790
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is like the way we've done the podcast where we explore all these</v>

1859
00:50:23.791 --> 00:50:24.511
<v Speaker 3>different ideas,</v>

1860
00:50:24.511 --> 00:50:26.790
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a shamanism or,</v>

1861
00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:30.420
<v Speaker 3>or big foot or Ufo shows are fringe topics,</v>

1862
00:50:30.421 --> 00:50:31.380
<v Speaker 3>crop circles,</v>

1863
00:50:31.381 --> 00:50:32.310
<v Speaker 3>reincarnation,</v>

1864
00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:33.323
<v Speaker 3>psychics,</v>

1865
00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:36.260
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to talk about it on the podcast.</v>

1866
00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:41.100
<v Speaker 3>I'll have a guy like you or Ari or Duncan or Jolie or any comedian come on and</v>

1867
00:50:41.101 --> 00:50:41.611
<v Speaker 3>we'll say,</v>

1868
00:50:41.611 --> 00:50:42.240
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1869
00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:42.571
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1870
00:50:42.571 --> 00:50:43.350
<v Speaker 3>we'll do it right now.</v>

1871
00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:44.270
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about big foot?</v>

1872
00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:44.760
<v Speaker 3>Do you think?</v>

1873
00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.650
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that is possible?</v>

1874
00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:51.420
<v Speaker 3>There could be an undiscovered primate that people have been talking about</v>

1875
00:50:51.421 --> 00:50:53.520
<v Speaker 3>reporting for ages and it's somehow or another,</v>

1876
00:50:53.521 --> 00:50:58.521
<v Speaker 3>it alluded photography except for a few really questionable photos and some</v>

1877
00:50:59.251 --> 00:51:01.950
<v Speaker 3>really fucking shitty video that looks fake as fuck.</v>

1878
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.900
<v Speaker 3>Put all that aside,</v>

1879
00:51:03.901 --> 00:51:04.160
<v Speaker 3>Paul,</v>

1880
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:04.891
<v Speaker 3>the hoaxes aside,</v>

1881
00:51:04.891 --> 00:51:05.730
<v Speaker 3>do you think it's possible?</v>

1882
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:06.540
<v Speaker 3>It's possible.</v>

1883
00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:07.260
<v Speaker 3>100%.</v>

1884
00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:07.820
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think?</v>

1885
00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:08.670
<v Speaker 3>Cause I believe,</v>

1886
00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:09.390
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

1887
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:09.601
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1888
00:51:09.601 --> 00:51:10.434
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>

1889
00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:10.810
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1890
00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:12.130
<v Speaker 4>I believe in Loch lochness monster.</v>

1891
00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:13.300
<v Speaker 4>I believe in Tuba.</v>

1892
00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:14.200
<v Speaker 4>Coffee can fly.</v>

1893
00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.730
<v Speaker 4>Do I believe I can fly</v>

1894
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.380
<v Speaker 3>pee on you if you're a 14 year old girl and you didn't know why you were there?</v>

1895
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:23.950
<v Speaker 4>I definitely believe that I have the capability to fly in my body.</v>

1896
00:51:23.951 --> 00:51:25.000
<v Speaker 4>I just haven't figured it out.</v>

1897
00:51:25.001 --> 00:51:25.231
<v Speaker 4>And we'll,</v>

1898
00:51:25.231 --> 00:51:26.430
<v Speaker 4>once we do tap into that,</v>

1899
00:51:26.431 --> 00:51:27.264
<v Speaker 4>I will be able to fly.</v>

1900
00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1901
00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:28.690
<v Speaker 1>But like Bill Hicks,</v>

1902
00:51:28.691 --> 00:51:30.450
<v Speaker 1>she used to say star on the ground floor,</v>

1903
00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.760
<v Speaker 1>like set a great joke about the young man acid.</v>

1904
00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Thought he could fly lept to his death.</v>

1905
00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:42.480
<v Speaker 1>What a tragedy it goes when an idiot because you taught him can fly.</v>

1906
00:51:42.481 --> 00:51:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Why did he start off from the ground go?</v>

1907
00:51:45.331 --> 00:51:46.021
<v Speaker 1>You feel like that?</v>

1908
00:51:46.021 --> 00:51:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I remember when Star Wars Wars,</v>

1909
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:49.100
<v Speaker 4>Star wars return of the Jedi came out.</v>

1910
00:51:49.101 --> 00:51:49.161
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1911
00:51:49.161 --> 00:51:49.311
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1912
00:51:49.311 --> 00:51:49.581
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1913
00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:50.000
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1914
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.230
<v Speaker 4>empire strikes back came out.</v>

1915
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:56.480
<v Speaker 4>I remember watching Luke move stuff with his mind and I remember being in the</v>

1916
00:51:56.481 --> 00:51:59.480
<v Speaker 4>back of my car trying to do that hardest fuck,</v>

1917
00:51:59.481 --> 00:52:00.470
<v Speaker 4>like staring at objects,</v>

1918
00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:04.980
<v Speaker 1>trying to make shit swear to God.</v>

1919
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:05.411
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1920
00:52:05.411 --> 00:52:07.000
<v Speaker 1>that seems logical.</v>

1921
00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:08.163
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1922
00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:11.030
<v Speaker 1>there's certain aspects of life it seems so preposterous.</v>

1923
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Unrelenting electricity.</v>

1924
00:52:12.401 --> 00:52:13.240
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that?</v>

1925
00:52:13.241 --> 00:52:14.020
<v Speaker 1>It just hits you.</v>

1926
00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen those Tesla and</v>

1927
00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:18.790
<v Speaker 3>like experiments where he's like touching electricity and it was like a Bolton's</v>

1928
00:52:18.791 --> 00:52:22.900
<v Speaker 3>flying big Tesla coil and is connected to his arm.</v>

1929
00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:23.740
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

1930
00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:24.910
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen any of those photos?</v>

1931
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:26.460
<v Speaker 3>Did Tesla just can I,</v>

1932
00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.480
<v Speaker 3>have you seen the new Tesla fucking car?</v>

1933
00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:33.330
<v Speaker 3>Did you see them all explode when hurricane sandy hit the beach in a,</v>

1934
00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:33.661
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1935
00:52:33.661 --> 00:52:34.450
<v Speaker 3>in New Jersey?</v>

1936
00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:34.840
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1937
00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:35.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1938
00:52:35.201 --> 00:52:37.510
<v Speaker 3>there was a whole warehouse that had like this.</v>

1939
00:52:37.511 --> 00:52:37.990
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1940
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.381
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

1941
00:52:38.381 --> 00:52:38.621
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1942
00:52:38.621 --> 00:52:39.670
<v Speaker 3>they had a dock in,</v>

1943
00:52:39.671 --> 00:52:41.110
<v Speaker 3>they had all these new</v>

1944
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:42.091
<v Speaker 1>Karmas.</v>

1945
00:52:42.091 --> 00:52:42.870
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

1946
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:44.010
<v Speaker 1>The Fisker Karma.</v>

1947
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Was it a Tesla as though</v>

1948
00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:47.420
<v Speaker 1>the grant?</v>

1949
00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:47.571
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1950
00:52:47.571 --> 00:52:48.420
<v Speaker 1>it looks gorgeous.</v>

1951
00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:49.561
<v Speaker 1>Quite a few.</v>

1952
00:52:49.561 --> 00:52:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1953
00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.610
<v Speaker 3>Really beautiful electric cars right now.</v>

1954
00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:56.320
<v Speaker 3>But the Fisker Karma is the one and they have like a 16 of them I think exploded</v>

1955
00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:57.041
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>

1956
00:52:57.041 --> 00:52:58.270
<v Speaker 3>on the docks.</v>

1957
00:52:58.590 --> 00:53:01.140
<v Speaker 1>They had them on the docks and the water came up on the water,</v>

1958
00:53:01.141 --> 00:53:02.940
<v Speaker 1>hit these fucking electric</v>

1959
00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:09.570
<v Speaker 1>transformer clocking blew up and everybody was like,</v>

1960
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh okay.</v>

1961
00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:12.683
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1962
00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they knew that would happen.</v>

1963
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:15.710
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you drive?</v>

1964
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.310
<v Speaker 1>We're fucking standing water.</v>

1965
00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:19.020
<v Speaker 1>What have you tried to home from a flood?</v>

1966
00:53:19.021 --> 00:53:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Is Your fucking car explode?</v>

1967
00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:21.481
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1968
00:53:21.481 --> 00:53:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Cause I can deal with my car shorting out.</v>

1969
00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.120
<v Speaker 1>It's sitting,</v>

1970
00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.500
<v Speaker 1>they're scared to leave.</v>

1971
00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.960
<v Speaker 1>If I can save like two bucks a gallon,</v>

1972
00:53:28.961 --> 00:53:31.480
<v Speaker 1>but my car explodes when I hit a puddle.</v>

1973
00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Is that going to happen?</v>

1974
00:53:33.311 --> 00:53:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Is that what the fuck is really going on?</v>

1975
00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:37.950
<v Speaker 1>That does that Tessa looks bad.</v>

1976
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

1977
00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:39.483
<v Speaker 1>we've won a,</v>

1978
00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:40.670
<v Speaker 3>it was either murdered,</v>

1979
00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:44.180
<v Speaker 3>murdered motor trend or road and track car of the year.</v>

1980
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:46.790
<v Speaker 3>One of those big magazines made it the car,</v>

1981
00:53:46.791 --> 00:53:47.450
<v Speaker 3>the or the uh,</v>

1982
00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:47.961
<v Speaker 3>Tesla.</v>

1983
00:53:47.961 --> 00:53:48.800
<v Speaker 3>Not The roadster,</v>

1984
00:53:48.801 --> 00:53:50.150
<v Speaker 3>but the larger car.</v>

1985
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:52.100
<v Speaker 3>Something that something asks.</v>

1986
00:53:52.101 --> 00:53:54.380
<v Speaker 3>It's a like a four door and uh,</v>

1987
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:56.990
<v Speaker 3>apparently it's just a marvel of engineering.</v>

1988
00:53:56.991 --> 00:53:57.824
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1989
00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:01.880
<v Speaker 1>the real problem is going to be a row state taxes on roads.</v>

1990
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.170
<v Speaker 1>The roads are going to shit.</v>

1991
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.700
<v Speaker 1>This is a lot</v>

1992
00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:04.570
<v Speaker 3>problems though.</v>

1993
00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.900
<v Speaker 3>Then another problem is the fact that everybody wants to pretend that buying</v>

1994
00:54:07.901 --> 00:54:12.300
<v Speaker 3>some sort of an electric car removes you from the fossil fuel food chain.</v>

1995
00:54:12.301 --> 00:54:12.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1996
00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:17.080
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't and in fact it connects you with some even shady or minerals on</v>

1997
00:54:17.081 --> 00:54:20.770
<v Speaker 3>like a really large scale like lithium ion and all those different minerals.</v>

1998
00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.990
<v Speaker 3>A lot of those or conflict minerals.</v>

1999
00:54:22.991 --> 00:54:24.430
<v Speaker 3>They come from the Congo,</v>

2000
00:54:24.431 --> 00:54:25.930
<v Speaker 3>they come from Afghanistan.</v>

2001
00:54:25.931 --> 00:54:28.270
<v Speaker 3>They come from like if I was Brian Count,</v>

2002
00:54:28.271 --> 00:54:29.420
<v Speaker 3>I'd say I've got a stone.</v>

2003
00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.730
<v Speaker 3>If I was a amber Lyon,</v>

2004
00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:33.341
<v Speaker 3>I'd say,</v>

2005
00:54:33.341 --> 00:54:33.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2006
00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:34.950
<v Speaker 3>what was it?</v>

2007
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.680
<v Speaker 3>She was fine.</v>

2008
00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Bahrain please.</v>

2009
00:54:36.601 --> 00:54:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Not In the bottom lane lane.</v>

2010
00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:39.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2011
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:40.370
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2012
00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:41.420
<v Speaker 3>you know these,</v>

2013
00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:43.040
<v Speaker 3>these minerals that you,</v>

2014
00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:46.550
<v Speaker 3>you need to create a lithium ion battery by the way.</v>

2015
00:54:46.551 --> 00:54:47.151
<v Speaker 3>Mad Labs,</v>

2016
00:54:47.151 --> 00:54:49.310
<v Speaker 3>Brian Callan and mad love to amber line,</v>

2017
00:54:49.311 --> 00:54:50.144
<v Speaker 3>which is fucking with you.</v>

2018
00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Those minerals that you need to make batteries.</v>

2019
00:54:52.971 --> 00:54:56.720
<v Speaker 3>They come from like really fucking imprisoned and poverished areas.</v>

2020
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:58.010
<v Speaker 3>Their conflict minerals.</v>

2021
00:54:58.011 --> 00:55:00.410
<v Speaker 3>Lithium ion is officially like a conflict mineral.</v>

2022
00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:03.440
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of the shit that you need to even make cell phones.</v>

2023
00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:04.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2024
00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:06.970
<v Speaker 3>I think vice had a guide they had,</v>

2025
00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:11.510
<v Speaker 3>they did a a vice guide to travel episode where Shane Smith went to the Congo.</v>

2026
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they're not all the travel channel.</v>

2027
00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see one of their fucking shows because it's too deep.</v>

2028
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:18.120
<v Speaker 1>They go to the same shipboard aim does.</v>

2029
00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:18.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2030
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:19.940
<v Speaker 1>they go way further than Baroda and</v>

2031
00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:28.860
<v Speaker 3>further extended mean close Simon clothes where vice vice goes to the fucking</v>

2032
00:55:28.991 --> 00:55:30.190
<v Speaker 3>Congo deep,</v>

2033
00:55:30.191 --> 00:55:30.491
<v Speaker 3>deep,</v>

2034
00:55:30.491 --> 00:55:32.280
<v Speaker 3>deep and talks to warlords.</v>

2035
00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:32.730
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2036
00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:34.150
<v Speaker 3>Did they go looking for dinosaur?</v>

2037
00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2038
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:35.031
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

2039
00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:35.400
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

2040
00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see that.</v>

2041
00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:37.770
<v Speaker 1>I didn't they you put that on,</v>

2042
00:55:37.771 --> 00:55:38.500
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

2043
00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:39.930
<v Speaker 1>We enjoy watching her on the Internet.</v>

2044
00:55:39.931 --> 00:55:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Why can't travel boy</v>

2045
00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:42.000
<v Speaker 3>your correct.</v>

2046
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.960
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

2047
00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:45.510
<v Speaker 3>most people that run these organizations,</v>

2048
00:55:45.511 --> 00:55:47.090
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a network or you know,</v>

2049
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:49.470
<v Speaker 3>you know cable or,</v>

2050
00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:51.600
<v Speaker 3>or whether it was broadcast television,</v>

2051
00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:52.290
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2052
00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:54.510
<v Speaker 3>they're very conservative because they're trying to sell advertising.</v>

2053
00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2054
00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:56.080
<v Speaker 1>So when a,</v>

2055
00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:01.070
<v Speaker 1>when a company like vice comes along and they have like really they have no</v>

2056
00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:04.850
<v Speaker 1>respect for any corporation at all because they'll do what the fuck they need to</v>

2057
00:56:04.851 --> 00:56:05.750
<v Speaker 1>do to make what they think.</v>

2058
00:56:05.751 --> 00:56:09.650
<v Speaker 1>They have videos where Hamilton Morris goes into the jungle and he's taking</v>

2059
00:56:09.651 --> 00:56:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Chris Drugs and align on his back and you know,</v>

2060
00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:16.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like they're not going to sell tide during those times.</v>

2061
00:56:16.671 --> 00:56:17.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2062
00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:19.760
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have to accept that they're not yourself time.</v>

2063
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:22.460
<v Speaker 1>But they do see that's what's really stupid.</v>

2064
00:56:22.461 --> 00:56:24.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's weird sort</v>

2065
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:26.570
<v Speaker 3>of game that we play.</v>

2066
00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Whereas we pretend that the people that see all the fucked up things that you</v>

2067
00:56:31.281 --> 00:56:35.120
<v Speaker 3>can find on the Internet are not the same people that wash their clothes.</v>

2068
00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:35.791
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2069
00:56:35.791 --> 00:56:37.910
<v Speaker 3>That wash their clothes or wash my clothes,</v>

2070
00:56:37.911 --> 00:56:42.911
<v Speaker 3>my gas or any of the variables and the end of the things where we try to target</v>

2071
00:56:43.071 --> 00:56:43.760
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2072
00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:44.091
<v Speaker 3>We're all,</v>

2073
00:56:44.091 --> 00:56:45.680
<v Speaker 3>we're all the same fucking people man.</v>

2074
00:56:45.681 --> 00:56:48.650
<v Speaker 3>And yet we just have access to different shit.</v>

2075
00:56:48.651 --> 00:56:50.270
<v Speaker 3>Now we need to accept that.</v>

2076
00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:53.660
<v Speaker 3>You need to just stop pretending that we're living in some sort of a Catholic</v>

2077
00:56:53.661 --> 00:56:54.440
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>

2078
00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:54.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2079
00:56:54.921 --> 00:56:59.030
<v Speaker 3>a Sandra Bullock movie view of the world.</v>

2080
00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.050
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

2081
00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:01.100
<v Speaker 3>it's not reality.</v>

2082
00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:04.760
<v Speaker 3>Reality is there's a lot of fucked up shit about out there and I can find it</v>

2083
00:57:04.761 --> 00:57:04.971
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2084
00:57:04.971 --> 00:57:06.080
<v Speaker 3>I can find it on the Internet.</v>

2085
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:07.123
<v Speaker 3>It's really easy.</v>

2086
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:10.760
<v Speaker 3>So you need to sort of adjust your expectations accordingly because there's a</v>

2087
00:57:10.761 --> 00:57:11.570
<v Speaker 3>lot of evidence,</v>

2088
00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:12.980
<v Speaker 3>a lot of evidence that shows that reality.</v>

2089
00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.120
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty fucking slippery.</v>

2090
00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:15.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2091
00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:16.250
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of nutty shit outfit,</v>

2092
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:19.280
<v Speaker 3>but that tells the car looks bad is fuck yeah,</v>

2093
00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:21.350
<v Speaker 3>but it will explode if he hit a puddle.</v>

2094
00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:23.840
<v Speaker 3>What a horrible feeling.</v>

2095
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.980
<v Speaker 3>It look dope.</v>

2096
00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:25.521
<v Speaker 3>I like the,</v>

2097
00:57:25.521 --> 00:57:25.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2098
00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:26.970
<v Speaker 3>that's the four 26.</v>

2099
00:57:26.971 --> 00:57:28.730
<v Speaker 3>That one that Brian just put up as the,</v>

2100
00:57:28.731 --> 00:57:28.911
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2101
00:57:28.911 --> 00:57:30.290
<v Speaker 3>the new corvette convertible.</v>

2102
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:30.680
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2103
00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:33.020
<v Speaker 3>it's got a 505 horsepower.</v>

2104
00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:35.780
<v Speaker 3>The last version of this,</v>

2105
00:57:35.781 --> 00:57:35.961
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2106
00:57:35.961 --> 00:57:36.621
<v Speaker 3>this engine,</v>

2107
00:57:36.621 --> 00:57:38.000
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called the ls one,</v>

2108
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:39.433
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>

2109
00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:40.370
<v Speaker 3>might be wrong,</v>

2110
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:45.260
<v Speaker 3>but it's a huge fucking power and torque that's also in the Zr one,</v>

2111
00:57:45.261 --> 00:57:45.921
<v Speaker 3>the same engine.</v>

2112
00:57:45.921 --> 00:57:47.450
<v Speaker 3>They supercharge it and the Zr one,</v>

2113
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:49.910
<v Speaker 3>it produces 648 horsepower.</v>

2114
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:53.840
<v Speaker 3>This is like for people who like talk about like muscle cars.</v>

2115
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:58.340
<v Speaker 3>This is like the greatest era of a muscle cars in the history of the fucking</v>

2116
00:57:58.341 --> 00:57:59.174
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

2117
00:57:59.210 --> 00:57:59.990
<v Speaker 3>Nolan.</v>

2118
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2119
00:58:00.291 --> 00:58:04.460
<v Speaker 3>The muscle cars that people are creating now actually can take turns and they</v>

2120
00:58:04.461 --> 00:58:05.810
<v Speaker 3>actually have good brakes.</v>

2121
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a Shelby Mustang they have now.</v>

2122
00:58:07.791 --> 00:58:08.780
<v Speaker 3>That's unbelievable.</v>

2123
00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:09.710
<v Speaker 3>The regular button,</v>

2124
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:11.870
<v Speaker 3>they have the three Oh two boss Mustang.</v>

2125
00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:12.913
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>

2126
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:13.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2127
00:58:13.191 --> 00:58:13.491
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2128
00:58:13.491 --> 00:58:15.140
<v Speaker 3>they're like moderately powered.</v>

2129
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:18.470
<v Speaker 3>It has 440 fucking horsepower.</v>

2130
00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:20.480
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievably powerful.</v>

2131
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.750
<v Speaker 4>Is it the Dodge Dodge Challenger challenger?</v>

2132
00:58:23.751 --> 00:58:24.584
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2133
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:27.340
<v Speaker 4>We went to muscle car though.</v>

2134
00:58:27.341 --> 00:58:29.220
<v Speaker 4>Then we went to drive um,</v>

2135
00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:30.443
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2136
00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:35.660
<v Speaker 4>Lamborghini's and Ferrari's and Porsche's on a track for a triplet and the</v>

2137
00:58:36.541 --> 00:58:39.120
<v Speaker 4>dude's just wanted to drive the dodge challenger.</v>

2138
00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:42.360
<v Speaker 4>They would take you out for a ride and they were like,</v>

2139
00:58:42.361 --> 00:58:43.950
<v Speaker 4>this is more fun for us to drive.</v>

2140
00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:44.580
<v Speaker 4>Why is that?</v>

2141
00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:45.810
<v Speaker 4>I have no fucking idea.</v>

2142
00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.460
<v Speaker 4>But they did everything and they do the,</v>

2143
00:58:47.461 --> 00:58:47.760
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2144
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.830
<v Speaker 4>the burnouts where they spin in circles.</v>

2145
00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:51.240
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just more fun.</v>

2146
00:58:51.241 --> 00:58:51.551
<v Speaker 4>Like the,</v>

2147
00:58:51.551 --> 00:58:52.111
<v Speaker 4>those things.</v>

2148
00:58:52.111 --> 00:58:52.270
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2149
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:52.561
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2150
00:58:52.561 --> 00:58:53.560
<v Speaker 4>I think like,</v>

2151
00:58:53.610 --> 00:58:55.440
<v Speaker 4>I definitely have driven a ton of those,</v>

2152
00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:55.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2153
00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:56.910
<v Speaker 4>Lamborghini type cars.</v>

2154
00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.290
<v Speaker 4>Those things are fun as fuck,</v>

2155
00:58:58.291 --> 00:59:02.220
<v Speaker 4>but it is a different drive than like it is really,</v>

2156
00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:06.450
<v Speaker 4>you don't feel as loose maybe as you do as a dodge challenger and dodge</v>

2157
00:59:06.451 --> 00:59:06.781
<v Speaker 4>challenger.</v>

2158
00:59:06.781 --> 00:59:08.520
<v Speaker 4>You're fucking sliding and you're,</v>

2159
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.420
<v Speaker 4>it's fun feeling it.</v>

2160
00:59:09.421 --> 00:59:10.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2161
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:11.041
<v Speaker 4>Well they have a,</v>

2162
00:59:11.041 --> 00:59:11.610
<v Speaker 4>they</v>

2163
00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:14.100
<v Speaker 3>have a broad sort of a um,</v>

2164
00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:14.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2165
00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:19.530
<v Speaker 3>you could pick from like a lower horsepower engine to like a really ridiculous</v>

2166
00:59:19.531 --> 00:59:20.520
<v Speaker 3>engine and those things.</v>

2167
00:59:20.521 --> 00:59:21.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2168
00:59:21.010 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 3>you could like ramp</v>

2169
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.070
<v Speaker 1>it up and there's a lot of people take those cars and they ramp them up even</v>

2170
00:59:25.071 --> 00:59:25.311
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

2171
00:59:25.311 --> 00:59:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Like the Hennessy Hennessy makes a 700 horsepower when those I love and that you</v>

2172
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.100
<v Speaker 1>get like those special edition cars.</v>

2173
00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2174
00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Well what they are though,</v>

2175
00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.270
<v Speaker 1>like the muscle cars of old,</v>

2176
00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:36.111
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>

2177
00:59:36.111 --> 00:59:38.780
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't take corners in them like this.</v>

2178
00:59:38.781 --> 00:59:40.730
<v Speaker 1>These are completely different animals,</v>

2179
00:59:40.731 --> 00:59:43.880
<v Speaker 1>but the challenger is still like a muscle car.</v>

2180
00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like the Camaro has become almost like a sports car because they handle</v>

2181
00:59:49.191 --> 00:59:49.770
<v Speaker 1>so well.</v>

2182
00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:50.241
<v Speaker 1>Might've been,</v>

2183
00:59:50.241 --> 00:59:52.970
<v Speaker 1>it might've been a Camaro they were driving now that I'm thinking about it,</v>

2184
00:59:52.971 --> 00:59:55.370
<v Speaker 1>but like we were taking corners in the lamb,</v>

2185
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Lamborghini and like 90 miles an hour.</v>

2186
00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2187
00:59:58.070 --> 01:00:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Taking corners fucking insane.</v>

2188
01:00:00.021 --> 01:00:00.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2189
01:00:00.321 --> 01:00:02.200
<v Speaker 1>You can do ridiculous shit with sports cars.</v>

2190
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:02.511
<v Speaker 1>I drove,</v>

2191
01:00:02.511 --> 01:00:07.511
<v Speaker 1>I flew to Italy for a day to drive a Ferrari down the coast.</v>

2192
01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:08.801
<v Speaker 1>Like I had to fly,</v>

2193
01:00:08.801 --> 01:00:09.461
<v Speaker 1>I had to drive a flight.</v>

2194
01:00:09.461 --> 01:00:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I think I texted you about it.</v>

2195
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:10.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2196
01:00:10.881 --> 01:00:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Which one did you drive?</v>

2197
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.171
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2198
01:00:12.171 --> 01:00:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I have no fucking clue,</v>

2199
01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:14.120
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

2200
01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>I just drove down the coast and I had a chase car in front of me and test score</v>

2201
01:00:16.651 --> 01:00:16.941
<v Speaker 1>by me.</v>

2202
01:00:16.941 --> 01:00:19.750
<v Speaker 1>They just taped it and I just fucking Lou,</v>

2203
01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>why was so much fun?</v>

2204
01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Like those paddles up,</v>

2205
01:00:22.611 --> 01:00:22.731
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

2206
01:00:22.731 --> 01:00:22.851
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

2207
01:00:22.851 --> 01:00:23.180
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2208
01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Just for lying.</v>

2209
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:24.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2210
01:00:24.951 --> 01:00:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Those paddle shifters.</v>

2211
01:00:26.031 --> 01:00:27.890
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are upset about that shit though.</v>

2212
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.350
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people think that a real sports guy,</v>

2213
01:00:30.351 --> 01:00:33.620
<v Speaker 1>you should shift it manually and that just because it's quicker to shift it with</v>

2214
01:00:33.621 --> 01:00:34.340
<v Speaker 1>the paddles,</v>

2215
01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.260
<v Speaker 1>like you're missing out on part of the experience.</v>

2216
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>And I kind of agree,</v>

2217
01:00:37.531 --> 01:00:38.091
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2218
01:00:38.091 --> 01:00:40.190
<v Speaker 1>because I like shifting my own gears.</v>

2219
01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I just do fun about it.</v>

2220
01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.081
<v Speaker 1>I did too,</v>

2221
01:00:42.081 --> 01:00:44.420
<v Speaker 1>but there's so many people that probably have never learned how to do that.</v>

2222
01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:45.830
<v Speaker 1>They can't learn on a Ferrari,</v>

2223
01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.490
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure that's just a sales thing because the paddle shifters are much</v>

2224
01:00:49.491 --> 01:00:50.120
<v Speaker 1>easier.</v>

2225
01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:50.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2226
01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2227
01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

2228
01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as satisfying.</v>

2229
01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

2230
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not that it's hard to shift.</v>

2231
01:00:55.461 --> 01:00:56.061
<v Speaker 1>You're on gears,</v>

2232
01:00:56.061 --> 01:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>but there's something that's like mechanically engaging about the clutch in</v>

2233
01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:03.770
<v Speaker 1>sliding and shifter for letting the clutch out,</v>

2234
01:01:03.771 --> 01:01:05.120
<v Speaker 1>hitting the gas the same time.</v>

2235
01:01:05.121 --> 01:01:07.850
<v Speaker 1>So it was something super sexy when you met a girl that knew how to drive a</v>

2236
01:01:07.851 --> 01:01:09.320
<v Speaker 1>stick and you were like,</v>

2237
01:01:09.321 --> 01:01:10.154
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2238
01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:10.520
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2239
01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:10.821
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2240
01:01:10.821 --> 01:01:11.290
<v Speaker 1>you got to,</v>

2241
01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:12.530
<v Speaker 1>you're a good dad.</v>

2242
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Especially if it was like a fucking Mustang or something crazy.</v>

2243
01:01:15.501 --> 01:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>This dirty pitches out there driving a big fat VA,</v>

2244
01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2245
01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2246
01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:20.453
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

2247
01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.030
<v Speaker 1>She wants to drive.</v>

2248
01:01:23.031 --> 01:01:24.770
<v Speaker 1>When you go to the movies and you've got to say no,</v>

2249
01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.410
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to not let it be on top of the first time we fuck either.</v>

2250
01:01:27.411 --> 01:01:30.800
<v Speaker 1>It's very important and then establish dominance immediately.</v>

2251
01:01:30.801 --> 01:01:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Bert Kreischer that I grabbed that bitch and let her know the feeling of gravity</v>

2252
01:01:35.361 --> 01:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>and the density of the bones and your hips.</v>

2253
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:39.021
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2254
01:01:39.021 --> 01:01:39.854
<v Speaker 1>Brian?</v>

2255

2258
01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.460

2259
01:01:47.461 --> 01:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Lately?</v>

2260

2261
01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the road every week.</v>

2262
01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:53.040
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm home two days this week.</v>

2263
01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:53.611
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take a leak.</v>

2264
01:01:53.611 --> 01:01:54.331
<v Speaker 1>Talked to Brian about it.</v>

2283
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>This is the reason no listened to the Brian Bird podcast</v>

<v Speaker 4>But we like,</v>

2291
01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:33.090
<v Speaker 4>like I listened to the podcast and when I hear you say things that fucking fit</v>

2292
01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.610
<v Speaker 4>maybe stopped Joe or like dice,</v>

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:36.121
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

2294
01:02:36.121 --> 01:02:39.000
<v Speaker 4>like two or three things that made me laugh so hard during the dice podcast.</v>

2295
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm smoking in the studio right now.</v>

2296
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:42.030
<v Speaker 4>Like a bad boy.</v>

2297

<v Speaker 4>That's a behind me is just an empty room.</v>

2299
01:02:46.051 --> 01:02:48.270
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of empty rooms here at the studio.</v>

2300
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.770
<v Speaker 4>So I'll tell you this story.</v>

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.880
<v Speaker 4>I just invented it so I never heard it myself.</v>

2429
01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:41.020
<v Speaker 4>Probably the wrong song for this button.</v>

2430
01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:42.480
<v Speaker 4>It's the perfect song fest.</v>

2431

<v Speaker 4>So tell me what happened.</v>

2432
01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:44.491
<v Speaker 4>A little,</v>

2433
01:05:44.491 --> 01:05:44.971
<v Speaker 4>a little fine.</v>

2434
01:05:44.971 --> 01:05:46.200
<v Speaker 4>Plus we had a little more volume.</v>

2435
01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:51.630
<v Speaker 4>So I check into the Kentucky Improv and a black dude texted my bags.</v>

2436
01:05:51.631 --> 01:05:52.201
<v Speaker 4>He grabs my bags,</v>

2437
01:05:52.201 --> 01:05:53.760
<v Speaker 4>puts him on the trail trailer thing,</v>

2438
01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:54.631
<v Speaker 4>brings him to the elevator.</v>

2439
01:05:54.631 --> 01:05:55.620
<v Speaker 4>I got to let him take it in the room.</v>

2440
01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.700
<v Speaker 4>He's earned his tip.</v>

2441
01:05:56.730 --> 01:05:56.931
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2442

<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2444
01:05:58.290 --> 01:05:59.490
<v Speaker 4>So we take them up to my room.</v>

2445
01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:00.481
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:02.160
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

2449
01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:02.993
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2450
01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.240
<v Speaker 4>And we don't talk.</v>

2451
01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.430
<v Speaker 4>After that door's open,</v>

2452
01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:09.420
<v Speaker 4>it's word elevator door to open the doors next to us in the elevator next to us</v>

2453
01:06:09.421 --> 01:06:11.640
<v Speaker 4>to open and an older white dude walks out and follows us.</v>

2454
01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:15.300
<v Speaker 4>Any ghosts us down like the whole hallway.</v>

2455
01:06:15.301 --> 01:06:15.931
<v Speaker 4>Everywhere we go,</v>

2456
01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:16.741
<v Speaker 4>he follows us.</v>

2457
01:06:16.741 --> 01:06:18.120
<v Speaker 4>He's going wherever the fuck we're growing,</v>

2458
01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:20.280
<v Speaker 4>but get all the way down to the end of the hallway.</v>

2459
01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:22.800
<v Speaker 4>How far away is he walking behind you?</v>

2460
01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.510
<v Speaker 4>Three feet behind us the whole time.</v>

2461
01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.310
<v Speaker 4>That mother fucker unconscious.</v>

2462
01:06:26.311 --> 01:06:27.144
<v Speaker 4>It's awkward.</v>

2463
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:28.530
<v Speaker 4>It's awkward and we're both know.</v>

2464
01:06:28.531 --> 01:06:30.420
<v Speaker 4>Didn't confront him all noticing it.</v>

2465
01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:32.100
<v Speaker 4>So we get to the last door and I'm thinking,</v>

2466
01:06:32.101 --> 01:06:33.120
<v Speaker 4>is this guy going to my room?</v>

2467
01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:35.130
<v Speaker 4>I would assume that guys try and do something bad.</v>

2468
01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:38.870
<v Speaker 4>You did something really wrong going on,</v>

2469
01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:39.733
<v Speaker 4>but I would think though,</v>

2470
01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.190
<v Speaker 4>why would you do what we do it?</v>

2471
01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:42.690
<v Speaker 4>What would the last thing you would do,</v>

2472
01:06:42.691 --> 01:06:43.100
<v Speaker 4>Joe?</v>

2473
01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

2474
01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:44.630
<v Speaker 3>here's what happens.</v>

2475
01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:45.500
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2476
01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:48.010
<v Speaker 3>when someone is mirroring you like that three,</v>

2477
01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:50.450
<v Speaker 3>there'd being very disrespectful because they're not,</v>

2478
01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.450
<v Speaker 3>they're not just the,</v>

2479
01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:52.910
<v Speaker 3>not just following you.</v>

2480
01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:56.510
<v Speaker 3>They're letting you know they're following you and they're doing it in a very</v>

2481
01:06:56.511 --> 01:06:58.070
<v Speaker 3>arrogant way or they're being flirty?</v>

2482
01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:58.461
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2483
01:06:58.461 --> 01:06:59.510
<v Speaker 3>they could be.</v>

2484
01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:00.270
<v Speaker 3>There's what happened?</v>

2485
01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:01.320
<v Speaker 3>Could be psychotics.</v>

2486
01:07:01.321 --> 01:07:03.080
<v Speaker 3>Here's what happened or what would you do?</v>

2487
01:07:03.081 --> 01:07:04.460
<v Speaker 3>Meet up immediately.</v>

2488
01:07:04.461 --> 01:07:06.050
<v Speaker 3>I would ask them what the fuck is going on?</v>

2489
01:07:06.051 --> 01:07:06.884
<v Speaker 3>Watch what he does.</v>

2490
01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.820
<v Speaker 4>It turns out he's in the room next to me.</v>

2491
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:13.910
<v Speaker 4>So he was going to his room.</v>

2492
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:17.800
<v Speaker 4>So as he goes I was drunk.</v>

2493
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:19.430
<v Speaker 4>See you're paranoid.</v>

2494
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:20.810
<v Speaker 4>Nobody was thinking about it.</v>

2495
01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:21.830
<v Speaker 4>Who is scared about life?</v>

2496
01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:22.630
<v Speaker 4>I have a lot,</v>

2497
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:23.463
<v Speaker 4>a lot.</v>

2498
01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.270
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking about more black.</v>

2499
01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:29.900
<v Speaker 4>I knew I was a comic and I wanted him to nudes know that I knew Kevin Hart cause</v>

2500
01:07:29.901 --> 01:07:30.920
<v Speaker 4>that's what I thought he was going to.</v>

2501
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.341
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2502
01:07:31.341 --> 01:07:31.730
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2503
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:32.240
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>

2504
01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.230
<v Speaker 4>And so the guy,</v>

2505
01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:33.801
<v Speaker 4>the guy,</v>

2506
01:07:33.801 --> 01:07:37.440
<v Speaker 4>old guy goes to open his door and I jokingly now told the Black Guy,</v>

2507
01:07:37.441 --> 01:07:39.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm a comic but I haven't done anything funny.</v>

2508
01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:42.350
<v Speaker 4>So I jokingly look at the old guy and I go pay if you want,</v>

2509
01:07:42.351 --> 01:07:44.240
<v Speaker 4>we can open up that connecting door and we can hang out.</v>

2510
01:07:44.241 --> 01:07:45.074
<v Speaker 4>Always.</v>

2511
01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:49.621
<v Speaker 4>It gets better.</v>

2512
01:07:49.621 --> 01:07:52.440
<v Speaker 4>It gets better by to the guys now can't get his,</v>

2513
01:07:52.441 --> 01:07:55.200
<v Speaker 4>cause he's now had panicked him and he can't get this door open.</v>

2514
01:07:55.201 --> 01:07:55.591
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

2515
01:07:55.591 --> 01:07:55.831
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2516
01:07:55.831 --> 01:07:55.981
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2517
01:07:55.981 --> 01:07:56.814
<v Speaker 4>I don't want that happened.</v>

2518
01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:57.451
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>

2519
01:07:57.451 --> 01:07:57.661
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2520
01:07:57.661 --> 01:07:58.261
<v Speaker 4>it'd be cool man.</v>

2521
01:07:58.261 --> 01:08:01.890
<v Speaker 4>We'll open it up or hang out with like the darkness and just talk to each other</v>

2522
01:08:01.891 --> 01:08:05.430
<v Speaker 4>at night and he can't get his door open and finding is this door open?</v>

2523
01:08:05.610 --> 01:08:05.941
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

2524
01:08:05.941 --> 01:08:06.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't want that to happen.</v>

2525
01:08:07.110 --> 01:08:08.700
<v Speaker 4>The door opens before you can close it.</v>

2526
01:08:08.701 --> 01:08:09.750
<v Speaker 4>I stick my head in and I go,</v>

2527
01:08:09.751 --> 01:08:10.584
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

2528
01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:12.570
<v Speaker 4>if you change your mind,</v>

2529
01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.550
<v Speaker 4>knock and scratch.</v>

2530
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:18.200
<v Speaker 1>So he goes,</v>

2531
01:08:18.210 --> 01:08:18.710
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2532
01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:19.750
<v Speaker 1>And he shuts the door and he's</v>

2533
01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:20.590
<v Speaker 4>fucking panicked.</v>

2534
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:21.640
<v Speaker 4>And I looked to the black guy,</v>

2535
01:08:21.641 --> 01:08:22.510
<v Speaker 4>the black guy's gone,</v>

2536
01:08:22.511 --> 01:08:23.380

01:08:26.141 --> 01:08:29.820
<v Speaker 4>So I go into the room and the was putting the bags down and uh,</v>
