1
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I look at that the same way I kind</v>

2
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>of look at music or the same way I look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at writing or comedy or anything.</v>

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.210
<v Speaker 1>So it's fascinating to me watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone go after something and,</v>

4
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and put it together and make something</v>

5
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:20.820
<v Speaker 1>that is almost unfathomable take place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a creation of an album,</v>

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>a comedy special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a,</v>

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 1>someone writes an amazing book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love when people get shit done.</v>

9
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do too.</v>

10
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.453
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.931
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as artists,</v>

13
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:36.351
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

14
00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:37.190
<v Speaker 1>does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

15
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.570
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an artist,</v>

16
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:42.070
<v Speaker 1>does that inspire you when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you go to see a great movie or</v>

17
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.460
<v Speaker 1>read a great book or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

18
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.310
<v Speaker 1>does that inspire you to want to create?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.400
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't inspire me to create a write</v>
<v Speaker 1>a book.</v>

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.821
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

62
00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:37.810
<v Speaker 1>over there and your Nike workout stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

65
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.191
<v Speaker 1>They think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:42.130
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you for not doing that.</v>

67
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.260
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

68
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The place I go to is very nice,</v>

69
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.420
<v Speaker 1>very nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

70
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.080
<v Speaker 1>it's not like the hot young hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm probably the best looking girl</v>

71
00:02:53.081 --> 00:02:55.990
<v Speaker 1>in the class</v>
<v Speaker 1>a road.</v>

72
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.280
<v Speaker 1>It was a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't help it.</v>

73
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>That's not true either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some cute ones,</v>

74
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>but the point being is that's not what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

75
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>but there is a sexual vibe there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>D I mean,</v>

77
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.250
<v Speaker 1>you're just there to do yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet there is that kind of thing and</v>

78
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>which is why I'm not too big a fan of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the classes.</v>

79
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>The team you up where they want you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>partner up for this thing.</v>

80
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever have that?</v>

81
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.021
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

82
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>like you stretch you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:19.560
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a partner.</v>

84
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Get unhappy baby with your legs behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your partner pushed down on you and</v>

85

<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.880

<v Speaker 1>Don't what happens.</v>

87
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>That'd be actually the smart board as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>married man.</v>

88
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>That would be the smart man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much porn takes place in the Yoga</v>

89
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Student Yoga Studio where the yoga that</v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher says,</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to review some poses with</v>

91
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:41.170

<v Speaker 1>I'll give you some tips.</v>

92
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.790
<v Speaker 1>That'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were,</v>

93
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just be as politically correct</v>

94
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>about this possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were single and the person</v>

95
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 1>actually was into you and this all went</v>
<v Speaker 1>down according to this,</v>

96
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the greatest like fantasy</v>

<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're in that hot yoga class,</v>

<v Speaker 1>on one instruction.</v>
