1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.210
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just,</v>

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.340
<v Speaker 1>we just adapted to our environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one reason why Chinese people</v>

3
00:00:06.341 --> 00:00:08.540
<v Speaker 1>have like really skinny eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.370
<v Speaker 1>but whatever the reason is why they like</v>
<v Speaker 1>to develop that,</v>

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.690
<v Speaker 1>that thin slit where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:18.890
<v Speaker 1>you don't have like this big wide eye</v>
<v Speaker 1>and develop like a less hairy body.</v>

7
00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Whatever those reasons are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they are,</v>

8
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.140
<v Speaker 1>but that had to thank God for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.320
<v Speaker 1>I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>one woman,</v>

10
00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 1>like every one of those attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little,</v>

11
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>the little slitty eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she can't,</v>

12
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.150
<v Speaker 1>she can't see that I have no hair</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she can only see the middle part</v>

13
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:39.860
<v Speaker 1>of my face and she's got no hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's really nice.</v>

14
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful Feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them do,</v>

15
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:45.260
<v Speaker 1>but there's some women that get their</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet bound.</v>

16
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.410
<v Speaker 1>That's an Asian thing to how they got so</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

17
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.020
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were bred to have little tiny sweet</v>

18
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:51.854
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>

19
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.450
<v Speaker 1>they're not like big American women feet</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the fucking Bunyan and like</v>

20
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>endless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one toe that's longer than the</v>

21
00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:01.570
<v Speaker 1>other one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't bother me now.</v>

22
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't bother me at all,</v>

23
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 1>but the crooked toes bothered me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't really care.</v>

25
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm all broken up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would I get yours?</v>

26
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Must be all fucked up from kicking</v>
<v Speaker 1>people then.</v>

27
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.091
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Who's don't?</v>

31
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have your feet don't smell.</v>

32
00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:22.490
<v Speaker 1>It means you're not working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not getting anything done.</v>

33
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.930
<v Speaker 1>I feel like mine smelled bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just put spray everything and it</v>

34
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:28.940
<v Speaker 1>still comes back the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a health issue,</v>

35
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe she wears sandals thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well you know when your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your feet are sitting in these like</v>

37
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:35.660

38
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're sweating and it's all just</v>

39
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>brewing function there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you have a plastic sock.</v>

40
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a nylon sockets.</v>

41
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Plastic socks on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

42
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody wear nylon socks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they do,</v>

43
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:47.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of nylon,</v>

44
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

47
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:54.470
<v Speaker 1>And anything other than wool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to accept all that</v>

48
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:58.040
<v Speaker 1>moisture and dry it up very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So things that get soupy in there,</v>

49
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.550
<v Speaker 1>like especially if they're like plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cotton's pretty good about saying to</v>

<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Mundo your balls smell Brian.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

52
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:11.570
<v Speaker 1>But if I take two showers a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was thinking they should have like</v>

53
00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>ball hats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>like where you put your balls and like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little little sock.</v>

55
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that make all underwear dude?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.640
<v Speaker 1>But twitter doesn't like fuck he talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this thing that you put.</v>

57
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.520
<v Speaker 1>They're like smaller than pants and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them on there like shorter than</v>

58
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:26.960
<v Speaker 1>shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

59
00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel you on this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Greg there under your clothes.</v>

61
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.210
<v Speaker 1>The ball socks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socks.</v>

62
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.830
<v Speaker 1>And then they have like an opening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if there was like an opening you</v>

63
00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:40.610
<v Speaker 1>can open for your penis to come out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's there technically,</v>

64
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.730
<v Speaker 1>but the flap is so big that you actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

65
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm down dude.</v>

66
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:46.274
<v Speaker 1>Let's invest money.</v>

67
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.010
<v Speaker 2>You want to hear a crazy thing you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about like intellectual</v>

68
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:51.190
<v Speaker 2>connection and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

69
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.430
<v Speaker 2>so coffee was invented in Ethiopia as we</v>
<v Speaker 2>said in,</v>

70
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.070
<v Speaker 2>in Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do it like a coffee ceremony,</v>

71
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 2>a very ceremonial way to prepare it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink it and when they do the coffee</v>

73
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 2>ceremony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

74
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 2>it's like they gather people together</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the village.</v>

75
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 2>They and they talk about things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They talk about the news of the village,</v>

76
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.620
<v Speaker 2>they talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

77
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 2>things that are going on in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

78
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 2>When coffee moved from Ethiopia to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yemen,</v>

79
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 2>totally different deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in Ethiopia,</v>

80
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 2>it's always a woman that makes coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas in Yemen it wasn't like that,</v>

81
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 2>but they still would talk about news and</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual and stuff like that.</v>

82
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Then coffee moved from Yemen to Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

83
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italy and England and places like that.</v>

84
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.400
<v Speaker 2>And the coffee house still remained a</v>
<v Speaker 2>place for intellectual exchange and</v>

85
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 2>discourse and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They plan the American revolution in</v>

86
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 2>coffee houses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

87
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 2>in</v>

88
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're wired,</v>

89
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:50.404
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck,</v>

90
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>there's something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about coffee that</v>

91
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.780
<v Speaker 1>like that like gets your mind going as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as stimulates you and wakes you up.</v>

92
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>But also the tea party movement like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

93
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 1>that had an effect on the way the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States took off just by simply the fact</v>

94
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>that they went from t to coughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

95
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people that speculate that</v>

96
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.130
<v Speaker 1>that's totally valid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.960
<v Speaker 2>That coffee consumption is a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>American,</v>

98
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive to ingenuity and imagine</v>

99
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.390
<v Speaker 1>fucking speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're country on speed.</v>

100
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.720
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they could show gross</v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic product posts.</v>

101
00:04:24.721 --> 00:04:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not starbucks impacted people's</v>

102
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.090
<v Speaker 1>productivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

103
00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:31.560
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to meet somebody at a coffee</v>

104
00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:33.660
<v Speaker 1>shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to talk about something</v>

105
00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:37.710
<v Speaker 1>that's different than going to drink</v>
<v Speaker 1>with somebody at a bar or have dinner</v>

106
00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:39.960
<v Speaker 1>with somebody or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>

107
00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:42.510
<v Speaker 1>It's somehow more about exchanging</v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

108
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:44.360
<v Speaker 1>more imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's stimulating.</v>

109
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.920
<v Speaker 1>The stimulant of caffeine in coffee is</v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulating and then the flavor is</v>

110
00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:52.740
<v Speaker 1>enriching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You enjoy the flavor and then you get</v>

111
00:04:52.741 --> 00:04:56.040
<v Speaker 1>fucking happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's been that way since the origin</v>

112
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.881
<v Speaker 1>of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

113
00:04:56.881 --> 00:04:58.410
<v Speaker 1>coffee houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

114
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Coffeehouses were always thought of as</v>
<v Speaker 1>places where people read poetry and you</v>

115
00:05:01.861 --> 00:05:02.880
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

116
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.820
<v Speaker 1>And he politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. And as you said,</v>

117
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.680
<v Speaker 1>plan revolutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting to me.</v>

118
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.940
<v Speaker 1>YeAh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is interesting.</v>

119
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that I like to work in coffee.</v>

120
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's one of the dumbest things the</v>

121
00:05:15.241 --> 00:05:18.350
<v Speaker 1>government has ever done is try to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>pot from people because you have,</v>

122
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.760
<v Speaker 1>you did smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find out it's awesome.</v>

123
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.940
<v Speaker 1>You don't die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you start distrusting</v>

124
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.880
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

125
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masturbation.</v>

126
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Think about how many people thought they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to die for masturbation.</v>

127
00:05:28.201 --> 00:05:29.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lose your mind.</v>

128
00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:31.980
<v Speaker 1>You get hair on your palms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when did that end?</v>

129
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.660
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't my time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

132
00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:38.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about earlier times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early 20th century,</v>

<v Speaker 1>19th century.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

136
00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:43.950

<v Speaker 1>There are medical books in the 19th</v>

137
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.830
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kellogg had this whole thing about it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>insanity,</v>

140
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.960
<v Speaker 1>insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It causes hair to grow in your palms.</v>

141
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a weird ability locked.</v>

142
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.280

<v Speaker 1>The idea is that spicy foods excite the</v>

150
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:20.610
<v Speaker 1>sensibilities and so if you eat</v>
