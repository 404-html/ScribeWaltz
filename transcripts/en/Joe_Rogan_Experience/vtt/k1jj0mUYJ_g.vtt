1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Any of this stuff and how do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.850
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about retroviruses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an incredibly intense subject to </v>

3
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>be researching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot involved and understanding</v>

4
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:16.431
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So understandably people rely on folks </v>

5
00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We rely on someone who has done the work</v>

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
<v Speaker 1>and is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a professor and when we hear a guy </v>

7
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>like you saying that HIV doesn't cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>aids,</v>

8
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very confusing.</v>

9
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.920
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure your life is filled with </v>

10
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.920
<v Speaker 1>controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

11
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.270
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is an average day like for you as </v>

12
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.270
<v Speaker 1>far as like hate mail?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you get a lot of hate mail?</v>

13
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.690
<v Speaker 2>Get a lot of me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he does actually minority really?</v>

14
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.740
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of guys saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said all of a suspected something is</v>

15
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 2>or can you tell me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you explain me?</v>

16
00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:53.610
<v Speaker 2>What should I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should I take anti bio tugs?</v>

17
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.800
<v Speaker 2>I feel horrible and I give them answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My answers not going to tell him why I </v>

18
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 2>give these senses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just</v>

19
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.310
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For people who don't understand your,</v>

20
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>your argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in a,</v>

21
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.760
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a paraphrasing sort of way is that </v>

22
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.760
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

23
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.650
<v Speaker 1>it's illicit drug use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a email nitrate and crystal </v>

24
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.791
<v Speaker 1>meth and that is what's destroying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immune systems of these people and then </v>

25
00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:24.740
<v Speaker 1>HIV shows up because their immune system</v>
<v Speaker 1>is diminished.</v>

26
00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Is that a fair assessment,</v>

27
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 2>diminished or not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is just the chance that you might be </v>

28
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.880
<v Speaker 2>positive or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like with all my copd,</v>

29
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can catch it or not,</v>

30
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 2>but of course if you are what they used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be at least in first line of aids </v>

31
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 2>patients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gay person,</v>

32
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 2>gay guys a day had hunters have in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

33
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 2>in the gay liberation days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of dates and so that's like </v>

34
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.850
<v Speaker 2>Mike Michael Collection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could detect or get in contact,</v>

35
00:01:57.851 --> 00:01:58.930
<v Speaker 2>any mid contract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

36
00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:03.931
<v Speaker 2>contact with lots of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pick up what's available on the </v>

37
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:06.991
<v Speaker 2>market [inaudible] you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where my Kolbe collectors,</v>

38
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 2>so they had this Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it hit all others tools.</v>

39
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.130
<v Speaker 2>They had hepatitis B bows and they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>to immediately and so HIV is a virus is </v>

40
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 2>a virus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it?</v>

41
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most harmless type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fibrosis would be no,</v>

42
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.510
<v Speaker 2>that's why we only discovered them </v>
<v Speaker 2>really well in the lab or worked in them</v>

43
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 2>in the last 10 years.</v>

44
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>So how could it be possible that no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>else believes this,</v>

45
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.630
<v Speaker 1>that the scientific community sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks down on,</v>

46
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.040
<v Speaker 1>on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your assessment of this and,</v>

47
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>

48
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>what is your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the argument?</v>

49
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Daddy's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think much politics behind it.</v>

50
00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:48.360
<v Speaker 2>You see the was hunters is we used to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>called,</v>

51
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.390
<v Speaker 2>still called those who are looking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>viruses doing something or another they,</v>

52
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 2>they apply this to find something to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>the for,</v>

53
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 2>to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they do something bad then they're </v>

54
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

55
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 2>So if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they are harmless,</v>

56
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.530
<v Speaker 2>they are not so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same.</v>

57
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You study your harmless is telling me </v>

58
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 2>what else is happening here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then we tried that in the sixties and</v>

59
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:17.581
<v Speaker 2>fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was popular then seventies that this </v>

60
00:03:17.581 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 2>might cause cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may have heard about this,</v>

61
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 2>but it was cancer poke come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was Kansas Coe and we tried very </v>

62
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.591
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why I came to this country from </v>

63
00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:28.591
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

64
00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:28.591
<v Speaker 2>that was a hot item.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said,</v>

65
00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We find that</v>

66
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.580
<v Speaker 3>as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a human papilloma virus can turn </v>

67
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.580
<v Speaker 3>into cervical cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

68
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.011
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can catch a virus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something one type or the theory goes </v>

69
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 3>and then if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If left unchecked,</v>

70
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.390
<v Speaker 3>it grows into cervical cancer as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>

71
00:03:41.391 --> 00:03:42.920
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're talking about?</v>

72
00:03:42.921 --> 00:03:44.660
<v Speaker 3>What they clean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what it really does,</v>

73
00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:49.661
<v Speaker 3>it makes a word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's why it's called Papilloma is </v>

74
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 3>another word for word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What to say,</v>

75
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.090
<v Speaker 3>what did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe 30 years later you get cancer when</v>

76
00:03:56.091 --> 00:03:59.250
<v Speaker 3>they come in with a long lead in period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can already something.</v>

77
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.540
<v Speaker 3>Something is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>

78
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.570
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't add up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why was this not slow?</v>

79
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.750
<v Speaker 3>They are not that complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They infect you.</v>

80
00:04:08.751 --> 00:04:11.930
<v Speaker 3>Now all they want to do is replicating </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they produce their own.</v>

81
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.810
<v Speaker 3>They don't wait 10 or 20 years for </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to happen.</v>

82
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.180
<v Speaker 3>There was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't you admit though,</v>

83
00:04:17.181 --> 00:04:17.720
<v Speaker 3>if you look in.</v>

84
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.730
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched a lot of people die in the </v>

85
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:23.750
<v Speaker 3>eighties in New York and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a number of them were gay,</v>

86
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.030
<v Speaker 3>but from Wiki,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

87
00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:28.820
<v Speaker 3>that was the first still lift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the made sure,</v>

88
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.570
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

89
00:04:29.571 --> 00:04:31.760
<v Speaker 3>but here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what was interesting is that most</v>

90
00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:36.650
<v Speaker 3>of them were dying from it from very </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar symptoms if you went there,</v>

91
00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:38.150
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>majority of aids,</v>

92
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.770
<v Speaker 3>and you can correct me where I'm wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

93
00:04:39.771 --> 00:04:42.890
<v Speaker 3>but the majority of aids patients die of</v>
<v Speaker 3>starvation.</v>

94
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.360
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult for them to hold </v>

95
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.360
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to retain food.</v>

96
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.550
<v Speaker 3>That was really when you went to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wards and I did,</v>

97
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.550
<v Speaker 3>you'd see all these aids patients and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were terribly skinny.</v>

98
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.890
<v Speaker 3>And actually what happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

99
00:04:54.891 --> 00:04:55.700
<v Speaker 3>the virus would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

100
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.840
<v Speaker 3>would destroy your immune system and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be exposed to you to get car </v>

101
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.860
<v Speaker 3>pullman car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Posey Sarcoma,</v>

102
00:05:00.861 --> 00:05:05.861
<v Speaker 3>which was a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these rare skin cancers that only old </v>

103
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:06.410
<v Speaker 3>people get an all kinds of awful </v>
<v Speaker 3>diseases.</v>

104
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched people with these terrible </v>

105
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.410
<v Speaker 3>rashes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know what.</v>

106
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.480
<v Speaker 3>You're not a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a doctor at all.</v>

107
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm just an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

108
00:05:12.741 --> 00:05:13.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know nothing.</v>

109
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.440
<v Speaker 3>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

110
00:05:15.441 --> 00:05:15.770
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

111
00:05:15.771 --> 00:05:18.120
<v Speaker 3>I've read a lot of innovation over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said you went to.</v>

112
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've read a lot about it and correct me </v>

113
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.720
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a layman so,</v>

114
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.810
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

115
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

116
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get to a question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a,</v>

117
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.120
<v Speaker 3>it's not a point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a question,</v>

118
00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:30.710
<v Speaker 3>but I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that,</v>

119
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there was clearly in their </v>

120
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 3>bloodstream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get tested for what they'd call</v>

121
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.000
<v Speaker 3>HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not seeing the virus.</v>

122
00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:43.001
<v Speaker 3>What you get tested for and what shows </v>
<v Speaker 3>up on your test is antibodies to the </v>

123
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:43.001
<v Speaker 3>virus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

124
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 3>Very important point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

125
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just as opposite as you could get </v>

126
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.660
<v Speaker 3>other files antibody against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neutralizing and stopping.</v>

127
00:05:50.661 --> 00:05:51.530
<v Speaker 3>And Kenny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

128
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.830
<v Speaker 3>That is a vaccine that is nature's and </v>
<v Speaker 3>men's.</v>

129
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 3>Mankind's only protection against </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence is a vaccine</v>

130
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 4>for yourself or induced by somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However though,</v>

131
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.030
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the body mounts a defense with </v>

132
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.030
<v Speaker 4>antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

133
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.420
<v Speaker 4>what the theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

134
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.520
<v Speaker 4>and I'll just add to this what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>theory was that what happens is it's </v>

135
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.701
<v Speaker 4>such an onslaught on your immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The immune system eventually gives up </v>

136
00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:17.540
<v Speaker 4>and cannot produce enough antibodies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your immune system gets killed.</v>

137
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.480
<v Speaker 4>Along comes David Ho with you and I know</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the name Dr.</v>

138
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.820
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Yeah Man of the year times man was </v>

139
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.350
<v Speaker 4>also middle of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the devil's in the 30 to a Nazi.</v>

140
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.180
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

141
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.960
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

142
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:34.460
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but having said that doctor,</v>

143
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.520
<v Speaker 4>there are a lot of people that took </v>
<v Speaker 4>protease inhibitors and I know him and </v>

144
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they were dying,</v>

145
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 4>they sold all their stuff because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were going to be gone in a month.</v>

146
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:48.130
<v Speaker 4>And Lo and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>proteosome inhibitor is keep people </v>

147
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.130
<v Speaker 4>alive.</v>

148
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the question becomes if protease </v>

149
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.081
<v Speaker 4>inhibitors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which by the way now you still have to </v>

150
00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:56.081
<v Speaker 4>use to have to take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you know,</v>

151
00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:58.750
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of pills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's down to four or five pills a </v>

152
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.061
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are a lot of people living with </v>

153
00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:04.151
<v Speaker 4>HIV that the argument goes and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least from what I've seen would have </v>

154
00:07:04.151 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 4>been dead and now are living very normal</v>
<v Speaker 4>lives and how do you explain that?</v>

155
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.270
<v Speaker 4>That's what they obviously play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but look at the people who don't take </v>

156
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 4>these tugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>World Health Organization,</v>

157
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.380
<v Speaker 4>the Centers for disease control say $35,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million of them at least on this planet.</v>

158
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.530
<v Speaker 4>Probably even more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is 30 percent of the African in </v>

159
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:26.530
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a million.</v>

160
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.060
<v Speaker 4>These million,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that million in American HIV positive </v>

161
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.800
<v Speaker 4>was there in 85 is still here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why didn't they die?</v>

162
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:34.640
<v Speaker 4>Or they did that though.</v>

163
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.610
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people died in the ACF.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Still a million.</v>

164
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.320
<v Speaker 4>He the numbers the same as it </v>
<v Speaker 4>originally.</v>

165
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.760
<v Speaker 4>Any million Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

166
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 4>there would be certain years later it </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be the same rule yet,</v>

167
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.340
<v Speaker 4>but there will be replaced in part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well isn't that because people were </v>

168
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:51.840
<v Speaker 4>catching it more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you,</v>

169
00:07:51.841 --> 00:07:52.440
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

170
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.460
<v Speaker 4>you had it already in in 85 when it </v>
<v Speaker 4>bites mission 1 million were positive.</v>

171
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:05.020
<v Speaker 4>Now still a million and of the 30 or $40</v>
<v Speaker 4>million who never get to live exactly </v>

172
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:08.070
<v Speaker 4>like they did before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take Africa,</v>

173
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.340
<v Speaker 4>Africa is it 30 percent are positive and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the continent would die out.</v>

174
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.590
<v Speaker 4>Remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guess what happened?</v>

175
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.800
<v Speaker 4>It was poor or 500 million Africans in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the eighties when it ended up the ads,</v>

176
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:24.500
<v Speaker 4>when they first detected in the guess </v>
<v Speaker 4>how many we have now,</v>

177
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.220
<v Speaker 4>like Africans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

178
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.050
<v Speaker 4>1 billion still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One third of them are HIV positive.</v>

179
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.400
<v Speaker 4>They almost tripled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the largest population explosion</v>

180
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:36.740
<v Speaker 4>in the history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The history of mankind,</v>

181
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:42.970
<v Speaker 4>despite each oem there of died away and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they still see in the New </v>

182
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:48.970
<v Speaker 4>York Times on the journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to hear about it that </v>

183
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:48.970
<v Speaker 4>you say they're doubling and tripling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see,</v>

184
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.560
<v Speaker 4>if you look for populations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not the same article.</v>

185
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 4>Occasionally they may get a little note,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so protease inhibitors do not</v>

186
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 2>work or they they are a fake drug or </v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they do that's positive?</v>

187
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:02.770
<v Speaker 2>That's helping these people improve </v>
<v Speaker 2>their health conditions.</v>

188
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing name possibly.</v>

189
00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 2>It gets them into a new lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

190
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:13.971
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel like having 10 days or </v>
<v Speaker 2>five dates when you're on protease </v>

191
00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:16.560
<v Speaker 2>inhibitors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of them show up and feel so it.</v>

192
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno how it balances off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about if you look at some of the </v>

193
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.040
<v Speaker 2>pictures now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They con admitted in the Congo,</v>

194
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 2>in the San Francisco Chronicle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

195
00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:30.801
<v Speaker 2>I have several references here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should get them out and show me they </v>

196
00:09:30.801 --> 00:09:33.330
<v Speaker 2>they age very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have liver disease,</v>

197
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:38.390
<v Speaker 2>they have heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kidney disease and the side effects or </v>

198
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:38.910
<v Speaker 2>what are toxic side effects is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>euphemism.</v>

199
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.330
<v Speaker 2>That's the only effective deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>HIV positive,</v>

200
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:45.510
<v Speaker 2>not no trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything you want to do is fine,</v>

201
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.250
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the the.</v>

202
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.320
<v Speaker 3>We have to go back for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact remains that in the eighties </v>

203
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.131
<v Speaker 3>and nineties I knew a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of gay men who were dying and I </v>

204
00:09:56.201 --> 00:09:59.080
<v Speaker 3>watched them die very specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were dying with,</v>

205
00:09:59.081 --> 00:10:00.700
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with blue splotches.</v>

206
00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:02.260
<v Speaker 3>They were dying because they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>hold down food.</v>

207
00:10:02.261 --> 00:10:03.180
<v Speaker 3>They were dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

208
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:08.190
<v Speaker 3>very slow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ammonia ammonia a great deal in the </v>

209
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.190
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched this W,</v>

210
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.390
<v Speaker 3>we all saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what happened was all of us said,</v>

211
00:10:10.391 --> 00:10:15.391
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something crazy is going on </v>

212
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:15.391
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see it.</v>

213
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:16.990
<v Speaker 3>It was just droves of walking dead in in</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York.</v>

214
00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:21.991
<v Speaker 3>It was such a tragic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't see that anymore in the gay </v>

215
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:25.441
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of them that I know are taking </v>

216
00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:27.910
<v Speaker 3>these drugs that seem to be wonder drugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>because what they've done is kept people</v>

217
00:10:27.911 --> 00:10:32.080
<v Speaker 3>alive and healthy and muscular and </v>
<v Speaker 3>vibrant.</v>

218
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.600
<v Speaker 3>You just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the gay community,</v>

219
00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:37.600
<v Speaker 3>the AIDS HIV is no longer a death </v>
<v Speaker 3>sentence.</v>

220
00:10:37.601 --> 00:10:38.860
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>HIV is,</v>

221
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.960
<v Speaker 3>isn't even something they talk about as </v>
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>

222
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:46.100
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the fact remains that you don't </v>

223
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.610
<v Speaker 3>have an epidemic of death in the gay </v>
<v Speaker 3>community as you did in 85,</v>

224
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.930
<v Speaker 3>91,</v>
<v Speaker 3>92.</v>

225
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.630
<v Speaker 3>And until David who came along with </v>
<v Speaker 3>protease inhibitors.</v>

226
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.180
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something happened there.</v>

227
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.710
<v Speaker 3>Something had to have happened there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

228
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.750
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you agree?</v>

229
00:10:58.751 --> 00:11:03.751
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't see people with Kaposi's </v>

230
00:11:03.751 --> 00:11:03.751
<v Speaker 3>sarcoma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hospital wars are not full of people who</v>

231
00:11:03.751 --> 00:11:05.030
<v Speaker 3>can't hold food down and dying in </v>
<v Speaker 3>ammonia,</v>

232
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are HIV positive,</v>

233
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

234
00:11:09.161 --> 00:11:10.480
<v Speaker 3>so how do we explain that?</v>

235
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.800
<v Speaker 2>It was at least according to the records</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I found in the light up yourself.</v>

236
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.230
<v Speaker 2>Mike callen for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may know that,</v>

237
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.690
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my dad's name,</v>

238
00:11:19.691 --> 00:11:24.691
<v Speaker 2>but it's a different Michael Gannon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says 1500 dates and with two or three</v>

239
00:11:25.211 --> 00:11:30.211
<v Speaker 2>or four nights sometimes with nitride </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhalants and Philomena and cocaine and </v>

240
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:35.580
<v Speaker 2>all of these talks up when you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you burn the candle on so many ends </v>

241
00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.160
<v Speaker 2>that he was gone in five or 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

242
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.430
<v Speaker 2>That's what gets them sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

243
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:47.460
<v Speaker 2>at least many of them know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least suspect that nitrite inhalants,</v>

244
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:51.340
<v Speaker 2>the poppers causing cap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Posey and wearing them out.</v>

245
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.620
<v Speaker 2>That is known</v>

246
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.080
<v Speaker 3>poppers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So poppers are what caused Kaposi </v>

247
00:11:59.080 --> 00:11:59.080
<v Speaker 3>Sarcoma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vague,</v>

248
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.600
<v Speaker 3>vague.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many number of studies have directly </v>

249
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:02.890
<v Speaker 3>shown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The coalition is a carcinogen.</v>

250
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.920
<v Speaker 3>It's a nighttime is in an isolating </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient that goes through the blood and </v>

251
00:12:08.531 --> 00:12:11.590
<v Speaker 3>causes the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Essentially it's a skin blood cancer.</v>

252
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.360
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're with your friends,</v>

253
00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:15.500
<v Speaker 3>drug users?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

254
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.710
<v Speaker 3>not all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the ones who know,</v>

255
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.690
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them were just theater guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

256
00:12:19.691 --> 00:12:22.780
<v Speaker 3>in fact a lot of them were theater guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>who were just gay.</v>

257
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are a lot of examples of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who were not drug users.</v>

258
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:28.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my God,</v>

259
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:33.031
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of children that </v>
<v Speaker 3>database because they got it from their </v>

260
00:12:33.031 --> 00:12:35.071
<v Speaker 3>parents or from blood transfusions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've new boil in the eighties,</v>

261
00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:40.201
<v Speaker 3>there were all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kids have junkie mothers who had </v>

262
00:12:40.201 --> 00:12:44.720
<v Speaker 3>lost intuit's in junkies maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact of the matter is they </v>

263
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:44.720
<v Speaker 3>weren't using drugs.</v>

264
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:44.720
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

265
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.810
<v Speaker 3>I guess the blood was passed onto them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

266
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.750
<v Speaker 3>Virus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He ate the question of act now.</v>

267
00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:54.751
<v Speaker 3>Act is what they gave them initially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was what they gave them when they </v>

268
00:12:54.751 --> 00:12:56.470
<v Speaker 3>first started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>80 seven now act correctly,</v>

269
00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:01.530
<v Speaker 3>me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a cancer medication that was deemed </v>

270
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:02.630
<v Speaker 3>to be too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who?</v>

271
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:07.710
<v Speaker 3>They used it for chemotherapy and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped using it because it was killing </v>

272
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:08.350
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in the cancer.</v>

273
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.840
<v Speaker 3>They still use it somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also for chemotherapy.</v>

274
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:13.260
<v Speaker 3>It's not different from any other </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemotherapy,</v>

275
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.190
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very brutal one.</v>

276
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.020
<v Speaker 3>The old potent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all brutal.</v>

277
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.500
<v Speaker 3>They're designed to be pulled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're designed to kill human cells.</v>

278
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a retrovirus.</v>

279
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.340
<v Speaker 3>Retrovirus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human Cells,</v>

280
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.470
<v Speaker 3>human cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemotherapy,</v>

281
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.210
<v Speaker 3>cancer cooks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He signed to kill human cells and that's</v>

282
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:36.211
<v Speaker 3>what they give him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They give him less and less so they tie </v>

283
00:13:36.211 --> 00:13:37.600
<v Speaker 3>act on the idea though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind killing,</v>

284
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.820
<v Speaker 3>killing human cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in new cells.</v>

285
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 3>The idea that because the cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because these are retroviruses,</v>

286
00:13:44.051 --> 00:13:49.051
<v Speaker 3>retrovirus is defined as something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>creates its own rna that copies the DNA </v>

287
00:13:49.051 --> 00:13:49.420
<v Speaker 3>of the cell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's invading,</v>

288
00:13:49.421 --> 00:13:50.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in other words,</v>

289
00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.170
<v Speaker 3>it mimics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It creates a clone of itself.</v>

290
00:13:53.171 --> 00:13:54.720
<v Speaker 3>It's actually someone you any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

291
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.910
<v Speaker 3>any viruses do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but isn't that what a retroviruses.</v>

292
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.690
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that how you would define a there </v>
<v Speaker 3>to convert it to a Dni in back to one?</v>

293
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that it creates almost a clone of </v>

294
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:08.760
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you create a medicine that kills</v>

295
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.100
<v Speaker 3>the virus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're also gonna.</v>

296
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:14.160
<v Speaker 3>You're also creating a medicine that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to kill the actual classes that </v>

297
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.160
<v Speaker 3>resemble computer viruses and computer </v>
<v Speaker 3>viruses in biological viruses.</v>

298
00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:21.670
<v Speaker 3>At a certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at that,</v>

299
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.130
<v Speaker 3>the fact that it copies the host.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

300
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.580
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an invasion of code.</v>

301
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.240
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Viruses,</v>

302
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.810
<v Speaker 3>a terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrifying,</v>

303
00:14:31.811 --> 00:14:36.811
<v Speaker 3>but what we've learned a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd seems from these different viruses </v>

304
00:14:36.811 --> 00:14:36.880
<v Speaker 3>and how they react,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

305
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:38.800
<v Speaker 3>I know you don't believe in protease </v>
<v Speaker 3>inhibitors,</v>

306
00:14:38.801 --> 00:14:41.710
<v Speaker 3>but literature like I believe that your </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

307
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.450
<v Speaker 3>but I do deliver and they screw up your </v>
<v Speaker 3>metabolism.</v>

308
00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:50.410
<v Speaker 3>They're not quite as toxic as act or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>DNA chain terminator,</v>

309
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 3>but now</v>

310
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:57.260
<v Speaker 4>all of the treatments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>antiviral treatments or cocktails of DNA</v>

311
00:14:57.261 --> 00:14:59.420
<v Speaker 4>chain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terminator and protease inhibitors,</v>

312
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 4>so you get many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Dr.</v>

313
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.120
<v Speaker 4>if somebody had HIV and guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people who take those eventually die</v>

314
00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:10.910
<v Speaker 4>form and it's not so rare they die 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years later,</v>

315
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.100
<v Speaker 4>the doses so that they won't die </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately.</v>

316
00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 4>I think that would be bad even for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>farmer,</v>

317
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:21.610
<v Speaker 4>but isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that better than isn't dying 20 </v>

318
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.801
<v Speaker 4>years later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>better than dying six months later as </v>

319
00:15:23.801 --> 00:15:23.801
<v Speaker 4>HIV did that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be better,</v>

320
00:15:23.801 --> 00:15:25.100
<v Speaker 4>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was Not HIV.</v>

321
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 4>There are millions with HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have nothing.</v>

322
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.690
<v Speaker 4>They exploding in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the population,</v>

323
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.980
<v Speaker 4>there are million Americans is still </v>
<v Speaker 4>around half million.</v>

324
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.070
<v Speaker 4>Still around no treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the only way to go.</v>

325
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.600
<v Speaker 4>Most Americans that are HIV positive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe or are getting treatment here.</v>

326
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean the ones that I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know only three,</v>

327
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.160
<v Speaker 4>but I know they're getting that.</v>

328
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.880
<v Speaker 4>That's not a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do know three.</v>

329
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.930
<v Speaker 4>Your HIV positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is a woman in her sixties.</v>

330
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.730
<v Speaker 4>They will be in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

331
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.300
<v Speaker 4>They will get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guess what they usually die from?</v>

332
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.700
<v Speaker 4>These guys are longterm treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Toxicity.</v>

333
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:02.990
<v Speaker 4>Will it die from pneumonia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from lung disease,</v>

334
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.590
<v Speaker 4>kidney disease and heart disease though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they get dementia.</v>

335
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:11.620
<v Speaker 4>They get the chemo plane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have these chain terminators </v>

336
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.220
<v Speaker 4>working your mitochondria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you become more and more senile.</v>

337
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.880
<v Speaker 4>Very early.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is described now in the San Francisco</v>

338
00:16:16.881 --> 00:16:19.400
<v Speaker 4>Chronicle just a week ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have this AIDS institute.</v>

339
00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.050
<v Speaker 4>They're there for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let it,</v>

340
00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:24.410
<v Speaker 4>so maybe it's that talks to his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is.</v>

341
00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:29.411
<v Speaker 4>There's no question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no question that drugs caused </v>

342
00:16:29.411 --> 00:16:29.411
<v Speaker 4>these drugs are caused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was.</v>

343
00:16:29.411 --> 00:16:32.840
<v Speaker 4>That was ignoring half of these eight </v>
<v Speaker 4>patients,</v>

344
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.920
<v Speaker 4>so-called HIV AIDS patients or HIV </v>
<v Speaker 4>patients are dying from all of the.</v>

345
00:16:38.001 --> 00:16:41.360
<v Speaker 4>We have a huge list of so called AIDS </v>
<v Speaker 4>defining diseases.</v>

346
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.400
<v Speaker 4>Twenty seven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not enough.</v>

347
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.710
<v Speaker 4>With those talks you cause heart </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease,</v>

348
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.300
<v Speaker 4>lung disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pneumonia,</v>

349
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.520
<v Speaker 4>kidney disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they die from.</v>

350
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.130
<v Speaker 4>Over half of a death certificate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

351
00:16:52.131 --> 00:16:54.830
<v Speaker 4>when did I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These used to die.</v>

352
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.210
<v Speaker 4>They used to die from it very quickly </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I saw it by the droves.</v>

353
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:04.470
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the the theater community in New York </v>

354
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.470
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a disconnect.</v>

355
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:08.710
<v Speaker 4>There's something wrong if they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>dying by the droves and all the sudden </v>

356
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.540
<v Speaker 4>they got on these protease inhibitors </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the whole community became healthy.</v>

357
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.780
<v Speaker 4>So you're saying it was like a placebo </v>
<v Speaker 4>effect for the entire community or the </v>

358
00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.430
<v Speaker 4>whole community changed its life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stage to life.</v>

359
00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:24.670
<v Speaker 4>Is that what happened to the truck cues?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The recreational drug use went down </v>

360
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.140
<v Speaker 4>somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where it's now,</v>

361
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.960
<v Speaker 4>but it was word of mouth that this was </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably part of the department.</v>

362
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Calendar,</v>

363
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:41.480
<v Speaker 4>these guys guided themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say this lifestyle is untenable.</v>

364
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.280
<v Speaker 4>It's unquestionable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

365
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.430
<v Speaker 4>there's no question that it is a part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem.</v>

366
00:17:46.431 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 4>Everybody who does like hardcore drugs </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

367
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.900
<v Speaker 3>it fucks your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shadow it.</v>

368
00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.110
<v Speaker 3>Hardcore drugs also create promiscuity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're doing math,</v>

369
00:17:55.111 --> 00:18:00.111
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a guy without the guys doing </v>

370
00:18:00.111 --> 00:18:00.111
<v Speaker 3>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

371
00:18:00.111 --> 00:18:03.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying it's nothing new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three billion years old.</v>

372
00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.320
<v Speaker 3>You can when you see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen me have sex?</v>

373
00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:12.321
<v Speaker 3>It's new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks very original approach to </v>

374
00:18:12.321 --> 00:18:16.520
<v Speaker 3>select interpretive dance because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>subscribed to on it and I applied there.</v>

375
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Their sex swings and drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That chocolate shake.</v>

376
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:20.340
<v Speaker 3>He goes nutty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

377
00:18:20.341 --> 00:18:21.760
<v Speaker 3>I had that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had that hemp proteins.</v>

378
00:18:21.761 --> 00:18:22.710
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

379
00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:24.950
<v Speaker 3>That chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

380
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.280
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really,</v>

381
00:18:26.281 --> 00:18:26.760
<v Speaker 3>really good.</v>

382
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.430
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what happened to these people?</v>

383
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.930
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be an explanation.</v>

384
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.150
<v Speaker 3>These people are sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take the protease inhibitors,</v>

385
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.260
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're healthy,</v>

386
00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:42.261
<v Speaker 3>they live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're saying protease inhibitors </v>

387
00:18:42.261 --> 00:18:44.061
<v Speaker 3>actually are toxic and very bad for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>body to change terminators,</v>

388
00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how are they getting better?</v>

389
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:54.290
<v Speaker 3>They don't get better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the evidence that they get </v>

390
00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.261
<v Speaker 3>better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get worse as much as they did </v>

391
00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:57.261
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fast.</v>

392
00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:58.440
<v Speaker 3>Did it before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know it.</v>

393
00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:03.690
<v Speaker 3>They acknowledged it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never cured anybody with these </v>

394
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:03.690
<v Speaker 3>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never any cure.</v>

395
00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 3>It's not cure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly like diabetes.</v>

396
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:09.660
<v Speaker 3>You control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you control the viral load.</v>

397
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.200
<v Speaker 3>And what they do is that it used to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the viral load would be huge.</v>

398
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.120
<v Speaker 3>And when you take the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

399
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:15.720
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

400
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.250
<v Speaker 3>the proteus neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>

401
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:22.430
<v Speaker 3>the cocktail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it reduces the viral load to two levels </v>

402
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.470
<v Speaker 3>where your immune system does not have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to work to get rid of it.</v>

403
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.090
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

404
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:28.860
<v Speaker 3>Because what it does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it creates a teflon sort of coding right</v>

405
00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:31.950
<v Speaker 3>on the helper t cell and the virus </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannot latch on.</v>

406
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.550
<v Speaker 3>Now what happens according to what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>read in scientific American,</v>

407
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.820
<v Speaker 3>is the virus eventually starts to </v>
<v Speaker 3>disguise itself and the cell no longer </v>

408
00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:45.030
<v Speaker 3>puts that teflon coating on and it can </v>
<v Speaker 3>finally latch on.</v>

409
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.370
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

410
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.880
<v Speaker 3>this is what I read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a different,</v>

411
00:19:47.881 --> 00:19:49.280
<v Speaker 3>what have you been in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your name is pine.</v>

412
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

413
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.050
<v Speaker 3>So actor Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not Dr.</v>

414
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:57.260
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll record those tapes on the </v>

415
00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:57.260
<v Speaker 3>establishment very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

416
00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.000
<v Speaker 4>But the reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you said yourself 10,</v>

417
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:02.130
<v Speaker 4>15 minutes ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you find in AIDS patients,</v>

418
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.630
<v Speaker 4>even those dying from it is not the only</v>
<v Speaker 4>antibody against it.</v>

419
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:12.370
<v Speaker 4>Dividable slowed is a new term in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>new invention of the establishment to </v>

420
00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.280
<v Speaker 4>make it sound horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What isn't probably what you can even be</v>

421
00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:16.140
<v Speaker 4>found.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It cannot be found.</v>

422
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.160
<v Speaker 4>So what they use is they is the so </v>
<v Speaker 4>called preliminary chain reaction if you</v>

423
00:20:20.161 --> 00:20:21.430
<v Speaker 4>heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

424
00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.880
<v Speaker 4>Molly's is the inventor of it lifts down</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

425
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.830
<v Speaker 4>Not far from the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also questions,</v>

426
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.020
<v Speaker 4>HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 4>AIDS lobby.</v>

427
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:28.800
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's there also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does acid</v>

428
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.880
<v Speaker 3>do just a little bit too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

429
00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

430
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:37.700
<v Speaker 3>Molly's is not your mainstream everage </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists like to meet that dude.</v>

431
00:20:37.701 --> 00:20:39.500
<v Speaker 3>He's a free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get him up here.</v>

432
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.630
<v Speaker 3>Come up here is in Newport beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr.</v>

433
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:49.630
<v Speaker 3>How did you come up with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did you arrive at this conclusion?</v>

434
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.020
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

435
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.570
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a molecular biologist,</v>

436
00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:55.750
<v Speaker 3>somebody who deals with chemistry and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how it reacts in the body.</v>

437
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.790
<v Speaker 3>What was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the turning point for you?</v>

438
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have all this science,</v>

439
00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:06.691
<v Speaker 3>all these scientists saying one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You came along and said another and </v>

440
00:21:06.691 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Speaker 3>continue to say another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

441
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.760
<v Speaker 3>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the,</v>

442
00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.000
<v Speaker 3>what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where was the Eureka moment for you?</v>

443
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.960
<v Speaker 3>Where as soon as I sell the papers from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gallo published,</v>

444
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:21.190
<v Speaker 3>I knew that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was politics.</v>

445
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:26.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gallo was painted as a really nefarious </v>

446
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:26.430
<v Speaker 3>character and a couple of things I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen,</v>

447
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.270
<v Speaker 3>but I mean the evidence was already in </v>
<v Speaker 3>debt.</v>

448
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.120
<v Speaker 3>All he felt was antibodies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not virus.</v>

449
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For you guys have a gala was at decided,</v>

450
00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:34.330
<v Speaker 3>is that nih?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

451
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:38.140
<v Speaker 3>besides an ai to actually isolated what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you would call the aids virus.</v>

452
00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:42.080
<v Speaker 3>The acquired immune immunity deficiency </v>
<v Speaker 3>virus as he named the.</v>

453
00:21:42.081 --> 00:21:43.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a syndrome I guess.</v>

454
00:21:43.691 --> 00:21:44.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

455
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.350
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was.</v>

456
00:21:46.351 --> 00:21:47.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not to be found.</v>

457
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:52.710
<v Speaker 3>He had a hell of a time finding it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You may remember the scandal that he </v>

458
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 3>didn't find it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he took credit for it when the French</v>

459
00:21:55.931 --> 00:22:00.931
<v Speaker 3>actually isolated it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you have violence with the high </v>

460
00:22:00.931 --> 00:22:04.411
<v Speaker 3>note and killing people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you need is picking needle and you </v>

461
00:22:04.411 --> 00:22:08.461
<v Speaker 3>have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This biosis can only hurt you if they </v>

462
00:22:08.461 --> 00:22:13.200
<v Speaker 3>are biochemically active candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elton now there in large numbers when </v>

463
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.130
<v Speaker 3>they are latent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neutralized by antibody,</v>

464
00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.500
<v Speaker 3>no action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing happens biochemically.</v>

465
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.450
<v Speaker 3>That was my starting point.</v>

466
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.660
<v Speaker 3>That is the situation after you </v>
<v Speaker 3>neutralize the virus,</v>

467
00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:28.000
<v Speaker 3>if that were a cause of disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of us vaccinated to polio would limp</v>

468
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.200
<v Speaker 3>it out and have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well no,</v>

469
00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:31.740
<v Speaker 3>because polio is a dead virus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

470
00:22:31.741 --> 00:22:36.741
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all the same doll debt unless </v>

471
00:22:36.741 --> 00:22:36.741
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Until they get to a sale,</v>

472
00:22:36.741 --> 00:22:41.230
<v Speaker 3>so that neutralized viruses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all have herpes.</v>

473
00:22:41.231 --> 00:22:43.630
<v Speaker 3>We all have measles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mumps.</v>

474
00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:46.360
<v Speaker 3>We have often hepatitis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once it's over,</v>

475
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.970
<v Speaker 3>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it comes back.</v>

476
00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.460
<v Speaker 3>That's very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we all sitting around king.</v>

477
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.390
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise the microbes would have all </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed time ago.</v>

478
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.550
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here we see HIV.</v>

479
00:22:57.551 --> 00:22:59.140
<v Speaker 3>It was a new virus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We tried well,</v>

480
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.100
<v Speaker 3>but isn't the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

481
00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.980
<v Speaker 3>that's almost the argument with HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would happen was your,</v>

482
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:09.200
<v Speaker 3>because we're always exposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathogens and different viral viral </v>

483
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.660
<v Speaker 3>viruses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your immune system is always working to </v>

484
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:12.660
<v Speaker 3>fight those things and does a very good </v>
<v Speaker 3>job of it.</v>

485
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.740
<v Speaker 3>You get the immunity immunity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

486
00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:19.741
<v Speaker 3>acquired a deficiency syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a virus that attacks directly </v>

487
00:23:19.841 --> 00:23:23.620
<v Speaker 3>the immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's why you be young.</v>

488
00:23:23.621 --> 00:23:27.910
<v Speaker 3>Men were getting very rare cancers that </v>
<v Speaker 3>only old men get from the Mediterranean.</v>

489
00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:31.150
<v Speaker 3>Why young men were getting pneumonia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

490
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:36.180
<v Speaker 3>why young men were getting pneumonia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why young men were getting a meningitis </v>

491
00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.950
<v Speaker 3>of the brain is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those young men who are getting it,</v>

492
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:43.980
<v Speaker 3>we're doing dozens of talks at once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can even delete the cdcs </v>

493
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.370
<v Speaker 3>self-reported gate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's scope analysis.</v>

494
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.640
<v Speaker 4>They deport dozens of talks and there is</v>
<v Speaker 4>not one in any of these statistics that </v>

495
00:23:52.251 --> 00:23:55.190
<v Speaker 4>they published faithfully until 84.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the vowels came.</v>

496
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:56.480
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we changed overnight.</v>

497
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.870
<v Speaker 4>It was from Republican to Democrat or </v>
<v Speaker 4>calculate to Protestant.</v>

498
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:05.290
<v Speaker 4>No more mention it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There wasn't one in any of these </v>

499
00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:06.410
<v Speaker 4>statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even one who didn't do any thoughts.</v>

500
00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:11.490
<v Speaker 4>They all went in and Michael Calvin and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all these guys who are into business or </v>

501
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:12.680
<v Speaker 4>law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in all of course.</v>

502
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:16.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm the publisher of term then in New </v>
<v Speaker 4>York,</v>

503

<v Speaker 5>computing across maternity or you're </v>

504
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.960
<v Speaker 5>contributing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't mind.</v>

505
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.340
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he doesn't want to offend dates.</v>

506
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.150
<v Speaker 5>You're attributing the mortality rate </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the.</v>

507
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.340
<v Speaker 5>The high mortality of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

508
00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:34.920
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

509
00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:40.550
<v Speaker 5>of death that for people who are HIV </v>
<v Speaker 5>positive to actually the amount of drugs</v>

510
00:24:41.101 --> 00:24:46.101
<v Speaker 5>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes and not the only and only six and </v>

<v Speaker 4>It wasn't possible to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have so many dates because we didn't </v>

514
00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.501

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

529
00:25:44.221 --> 00:25:49.221

<v Speaker 5>positive guy in the eighties and he did </v>

530
00:25:49.221 --> 00:25:51.250
<v Speaker 5>have literally a hundred and 50 </v>
<v Speaker 5>partners.</v>

531
00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:54.550
<v Speaker 5>Like think about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

532
00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.940
<v Speaker 5>when you were a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just one weekend in Vegas.</v>

533
00:25:56.941 --> 00:26:00.630
<v Speaker 5>What it would do for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now imagine if you lived on Santa Monica</v>

534
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.690
<v Speaker 5>Boulevard and you were 36 and you would </v>
<v Speaker 5>just do a meth every night.</v>

535
00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.850
<v Speaker 5>Cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish I was gay.</v>

539
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.320
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

540
00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.040
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

541
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.670
<v Speaker 5>Here's the big question though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>

542
00:26:20.671 --> 00:26:25.671
<v Speaker 5>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How is it possible that every other </v>

543
00:26:25.671 --> 00:26:25.671
<v Speaker 5>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not every other.</v>

544
00:26:25.671 --> 00:26:25.671
<v Speaker 5>There's a few others that believe in </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

545
00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.550
<v Speaker 5>A question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The things that we might kary mullis for</v>

546
00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:35.490
<v Speaker 5>independence and there's a few open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Many of them cannot.</v>

547
00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:42.140
<v Speaker 5>Is that what are the what the case is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just an unbelievably controversial </v>

548
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:42.140
<v Speaker 5>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't say it.</v>

549
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.270
<v Speaker 5>Look at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have.</v>

550
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.610
<v Speaker 2>I have no more catches students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never get a count in 15,</v>

551
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:49.750
<v Speaker 2>20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since I questioned each job.</v>

552
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I had everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a lab full of graduate students.</v>

553
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:55.050
<v Speaker 2>I got every kind I was supplied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

554
00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I got California scientists of the year </v>
<v Speaker 2>down here in Los Angeles and everything </v>

555
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.880
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was literally the blue white boy until</v>

556
00:27:03.881 --> 00:27:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I question HIV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these connections were going,</v>

557
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:08.340
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

558
00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:09.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

559
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:14.720
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are the example of someone who is </v>

560
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:14.720
<v Speaker 3>punished for thinking outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>box.</v>

561
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:16.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm vague,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let me ask you,</v>

562
00:27:16.551 --> 00:27:17.340
<v Speaker 3>have you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have.</v>

563
00:27:17.341 --> 00:27:22.341
<v Speaker 3>Do you have peer reviewed research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>peer reviewed primary research to </v>

564
00:27:22.341 --> 00:27:26.481
<v Speaker 3>support your theory because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with a lot of research on the </v>

565
00:27:26.481 --> 00:27:30.231
<v Speaker 3>other side and a lot of money was put </v>
<v Speaker 3>into it by a number of independent </v>

566
00:27:30.231 --> 00:27:31.110
<v Speaker 3>organizations that looked at the data.</v>

567
00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go to just show you this last </v>

568
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:36.180
<v Speaker 2>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

569
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:36.180
<v Speaker 2>I have it in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kim?</v>

570
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

571
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:41.040
<v Speaker 3>because that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that the big question for a </v>

572
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:41.040
<v Speaker 3>scientist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is your.</v>

573
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:41.040
<v Speaker 3>You want to go grab it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grab it.</v>

574
00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:41.940
<v Speaker 3>Don't grab it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

575
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Bring it over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No big deal.</v>

576
00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:49.080
<v Speaker 3>How many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean this was the last one and </v>

577
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.541
<v Speaker 3>this was the most difficult to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>published because it can't,</v>

578
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:53.860
<v Speaker 3>it can't be healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being a gay dude.</v>

579
00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:00.900
<v Speaker 3>Just thinking about what it's like to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dude and think about no one there to </v>

580
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.260
<v Speaker 3>stop the fun and it just must be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine a day?</v>

581
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.450
<v Speaker 3>Your body must be just trying to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>find zinc,</v>

582
00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>

583
00:28:10.441 --> 00:28:14.800
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get a 24 hour fitness right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can see six gorgeous guys.</v>

584
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.190
<v Speaker 3>I could bang it out and not even look on</v>
<v Speaker 3>their face and let him it like that.</v>

585
00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.480
<v Speaker 3>You said you can go to burke woman's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of girls there.</v>

586
00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.290
<v Speaker 3>You can just bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like for free.</v>

587
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:25.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do that.</v>

588
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:31.110
<v Speaker 3>So yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean initially I published in in the </v>

589
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:32.260
<v Speaker 3>best of the channels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was in science,</v>

590
00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:37.290
<v Speaker 3>the first debate in the science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the most popular American </v>

591
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:37.290
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

592
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:39.670
<v Speaker 3>and then I published in the proceedings </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the National Academy of Sciences.</v>

593
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:45.320
<v Speaker 3>I was when I was still considered as </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the club and then I became </v>

594
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.810
<v Speaker 3>execute excommunicate and then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes very difficult.</v>

595
00:28:49.811 --> 00:28:53.490
<v Speaker 3>Peer Peer Review means only the </v>
<v Speaker 3>establishment prevails.</v>

596
00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:58.890
<v Speaker 3>That is censorship by the mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lost everything in that is mainstream,</v>

597
00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:04.350
<v Speaker 3>but it exclude everything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenges their own investments and </v>

598
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.820
<v Speaker 3>their own piece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's a little unfair to scientists</v>

599
00:29:06.821 --> 00:29:11.821
<v Speaker 3>who are really diligently working on </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to find a cure for a lot of </v>

600
00:29:11.821 --> 00:29:11.821
<v Speaker 3>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are a lot of,</v>

601
00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.780
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure and you know them.</v>

602
00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:19.050
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of scientists who are </v>

603
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:19.270
<v Speaker 3>independent thinkers who who want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a difference like yourself,</v>

604
00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:24.660
<v Speaker 3>and it seems to me that more of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>voices would have,</v>

605
00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.020
<v Speaker 3>would have made themselves heard in in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

606
00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.510
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's now 25 years that the aids </v>
<v Speaker 3>virus has been in,</v>

607
00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:33.490
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the news.</v>

608
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:34.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

609
00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:36.040
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if that's the case,</v>

610
00:29:36.041 --> 00:29:38.320
<v Speaker 3>that's where I'm confused in the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other disconnect,</v>

611
00:29:38.321 --> 00:29:42.930
<v Speaker 3>the county's Taiwan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same letter to the Los Angeles Times</v>

612
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.450
<v Speaker 4>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get this new really concerned.</v>

613
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.750
<v Speaker 4>Can you publish the letter now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to get a dialogue.</v>

614
00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.180
<v Speaker 4>You will not get anything published.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

615
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:57.870
<v Speaker 4>It's complete censorship because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't believe because they believe the </v>

616
00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:01.771
<v Speaker 4>science has already been settled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas in part by the there are several</v>

617
00:30:01.931 --> 00:30:04.390
<v Speaker 4>journalist who interviewed me in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>past on this.</v>

618
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:10.110
<v Speaker 4>They did it once and not again even go </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jonah's channel and they hold one story </v>

619
00:30:10.181 --> 00:30:13.270
<v Speaker 4>and then there were no longer invited to</v>
<v Speaker 4>conferences.</v>

620
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:18.810
<v Speaker 4>The quality center called the Centers </v>
<v Speaker 4>for disease control or have vouchers at </v>

621
00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:22.951
<v Speaker 4>the Nih,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nia ard into institute for Allergy </v>

622
00:30:22.951 --> 00:30:22.951
<v Speaker 4>Infectious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No more answers.</v>

623
00:30:22.951 --> 00:30:24.850
<v Speaker 4>How many are excluded?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are a lot of gay people.</v>

624
00:30:24.851 --> 00:30:29.851
<v Speaker 4>I think though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they were sitting here would have a </v>

625
00:30:29.851 --> 00:30:29.851
<v Speaker 4>very strong argument for you to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so listen,</v>

626
00:30:29.851 --> 00:30:31.950
<v Speaker 4>I was dying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was 85 pounds.</v>

627
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm now 170 pounds after obviously his.</v>

628
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.620
<v Speaker 4>His answer would be when they're taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>the protease inhibitors are also weren't</v>

629
00:30:38.621 --> 00:30:43.621
<v Speaker 4>doing meth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's his answer in part and one would </v>

630
00:30:43.621 --> 00:30:45.550
<v Speaker 4>have to see those cases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not so many happy faces on this,</v>

631
00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.770
<v Speaker 4>on these trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

632
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.810
<v Speaker 4>They're toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's.</v>

633
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.550
<v Speaker 4>I've read that there they have nasty </v>
<v Speaker 4>side effects.</v>

634
00:30:51.551 --> 00:30:54.010
<v Speaker 4>They cause you to carry lumps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Side effect.</v>

635
00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.880
<v Speaker 4>That is the only effect you get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You taking a post,</v>

636
00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.880
<v Speaker 4>so how is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the question,</v>

637
00:31:00.881 --> 00:31:02.210
<v Speaker 4>side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't.</v>

638
00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.370
<v Speaker 4>Most of them get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now when they have a low t cell level,</v>

639
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.470
<v Speaker 4>they are asymptomatic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have no disease,</v>

640
00:31:08.471 --> 00:31:12.010
<v Speaker 4>and then they start taking these clocks </v>
<v Speaker 4>and on average six years later,</v>

641
00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.130
<v Speaker 4>they're dead on average.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the statistic.</v>

642
00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:19.360
<v Speaker 4>Let us show you the guys like Magic </v>
<v Speaker 4>Johnson who is gaining weight all the </v>

643
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.440
<v Speaker 4>time and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking my medications.</v>

644
00:31:20.441 --> 00:31:22.690
<v Speaker 4>When you ask or anybody asked what he </v>
<v Speaker 4>takes,</v>

645
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.340
<v Speaker 4>he never hear an answer.</v>

646
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.440
<v Speaker 4>My medications,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably b vitamin C or whatever it</v>

647
00:31:28.441 --> 00:31:30.040
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know what it is.</v>

648
00:31:30.041 --> 00:31:33.640
<v Speaker 4>So if somebody has HIV comes to you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they said I have HIV,</v>

649
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.940
<v Speaker 4>am I going to die?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You say what up?</v>

650
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.270
<v Speaker 4>Don't take the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't take antibiotics.</v>

651
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:44.310
<v Speaker 4>That's eats by prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what you get from these </v>

652
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.890
<v Speaker 4>trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is what it is you.</v>

653
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.290
<v Speaker 4>You kill your t cells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You caused cancer.</v>

654
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.200
<v Speaker 4>You'll kill your liver and your kidneys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your heart,</v>

655
00:31:53.201 --> 00:31:53.840
<v Speaker 4>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your.</v>

656
00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:59.340
<v Speaker 4>Fortunately they become retarded when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't notice it anymore than the </v>

657
00:31:59.340 --> 00:31:59.520
<v Speaker 4>smile in the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are fine.</v>

658
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:00.640
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so here's the question.</v>

659
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:05.641
<v Speaker 4>How many people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many scientists working on how many </v>

660
00:32:05.641 --> 00:32:08.380
<v Speaker 4>scientists are working on curing HIV?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch how many scientists are working in</v>

661
00:32:08.381 --> 00:32:10.290
<v Speaker 4>the field on HIV and AIDS?</v>
<v Speaker 4>20,000,</v>

662
00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:15.420
<v Speaker 4>$20,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do they not understand what you're </v>

663
00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.140
<v Speaker 4>saying and how do they not see what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're saying?</v>

664
00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.260
<v Speaker 4>How is it not being discovered all?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's stay with them.</v>

665
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.800
<v Speaker 4>How do they not understand what they are</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying for 20 years?</v>

666
00:32:23.801 --> 00:32:28.801
<v Speaker 4>They're developing a vaccine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is the vaccine mater hard vaccine </v>

667
00:32:28.801 --> 00:32:31.780
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or is not the vaccine that we need?</v>

668
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:37.590
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's vaccinating against something that </v>

669
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.590
<v Speaker 4>doesn't cause aids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one answer,</v>

670
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:38.990
<v Speaker 4>but they don't live here that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember it.</v>

671
00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:44.180
<v Speaker 4>Shannon is a British country doctor who </v>
<v Speaker 4>invented vaccination in 17.</v>

672
00:32:44.571 --> 00:32:47.150
<v Speaker 4>90 three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not In 1973.</v>

673
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:48.740
<v Speaker 4>17,</v>
<v Speaker 4>93,</v>

674
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.920
<v Speaker 4>four 60 pounds that he got from </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere.</v>

675
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:57.280
<v Speaker 4>He developed the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pox vaccine is still called pocs </v>

676
00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.010
<v Speaker 4>because is the cow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It worked.</v>

677
00:32:58.011 --> 00:33:02.660
<v Speaker 4>The extracted from the cow and </v>
<v Speaker 4>successfully protecting people against.</v>

678
00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now we have sog.</v>

679
00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:06.800
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long.</v>

680
00:33:06.801 --> 00:33:08.890
<v Speaker 4>Long dead was Edward Jenner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

681
00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:12.560
<v Speaker 4>Do you recall is still generic </v>
<v Speaker 4>vaccination in 17,</v>

682
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:17.570
<v Speaker 4>93.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he saw the milkmaids that they </v>

683
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.961
<v Speaker 4>weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were exposed to cowpox and I said </v>

684
00:33:19.961 --> 00:33:19.961
<v Speaker 4>maybe if I.</v>

685
00:33:19.961 --> 00:33:24.320
<v Speaker 4>and that's what I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and here we have the scientists the </v>

686
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.651
<v Speaker 4>most.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the most advanced and most </v>

687
00:33:26.651 --> 00:33:29.530
<v Speaker 4>sophisticated and by far the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>expensive scientific establishment that </v>

688
00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:34.151
<v Speaker 4>has ever lived on this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The American scientists to get 10 to </v>

689
00:33:34.151 --> 00:33:37.901
<v Speaker 4>$20,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>a year to research it and they keep </v>

690
00:33:37.901 --> 00:33:37.901
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

691
00:33:37.901 --> 00:33:38.650
<v Speaker 4>we need a vaccine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All we do is actively,</v>

692
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:42.740
<v Speaker 4>Edward Jenner did for 60 pounds in once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's 200 years ago.</v>

693
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.980
<v Speaker 4>Now they're missing out with a 25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do they have?</v>

694
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.610
<v Speaker 4>Ent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So nothing they on a white coat,</v>

695
00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:51.200
<v Speaker 4>but viruses are very different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

696
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.720
<v Speaker 4>We're not so small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Parks being a.</v>

697
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.420
<v Speaker 4>do you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you said,</v>

698
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.880
<v Speaker 4>SARC and all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have against virtually all viruses,</v>

699
00:33:58.881 --> 00:34:01.970
<v Speaker 4>we have vaccines and we have a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 4>one against HIV.</v>

700
00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.760
<v Speaker 4>That's what the test measures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's antibody Novos.</v>

701
00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.640
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do because it works so well.</v>

702
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.940
<v Speaker 4>That's why Gallo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nation's leading aids researcher had</v>

703
00:34:10.941 --> 00:34:15.941
<v Speaker 4>to steal it from France because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't get it out of people who have </v>

704
00:34:15.941 --> 00:34:18.350
<v Speaker 4>the virus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't ask those questions.</v>

705
00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.970
<v Speaker 4>That's what are the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are the.</v>

706
00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:25.940
<v Speaker 4>What was the French discovery?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because Gallo stole the franchise </v>

707
00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:26.630
<v Speaker 4>franchise research and took credit for </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

708
00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.810
<v Speaker 4>What were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What were the French scientists say that</v>

709
00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:33.260
<v Speaker 4>they were the ones who actually isolated</v>
<v Speaker 4>the HIV virus?</v>

710
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.800
<v Speaker 4>You would have never heard of him </v>
<v Speaker 4>without colonial US propaganda behind </v>

711
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.760
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They said it could be every biology set.</v>

712
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:45.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my virus could cause cancer or have </v>

713
00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:48.200
<v Speaker 4>published me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm famous and I get money and I'm </v>

714
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.310
<v Speaker 4>promising something horrible if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't follow me.</v>

715
00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:54.580
<v Speaker 4>So that's what they all did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The gala was one of the most successful </v>

716
00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:58.361
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was just at the right time when the </v>

717
00:34:58.361 --> 00:34:59.150
<v Speaker 4>AIDS epidemic came up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have device vaccines coming soon,</v>

718
00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.310
<v Speaker 4>coming soon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here I am.</v>

719
00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.040
<v Speaker 4>While his colleague in France got the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobel prize,</v>

720
00:35:04.041 --> 00:35:08.120
<v Speaker 4>but he didn't because they call them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So is that how it works?</v>

721
00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.570
<v Speaker 4>Like he invents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He starts working on some sort of a cure</v>

722
00:35:11.571 --> 00:35:16.571
<v Speaker 4>and then funds role in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It starts up a business of working to </v>

723
00:35:16.571 --> 00:35:17.420
<v Speaker 4>develop a vaccine grants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know when you work,</v>

724
00:35:17.421 --> 00:35:22.421
<v Speaker 4>how much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much money is involved in something </v>

725
00:35:22.421 --> 00:35:22.421
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just millions and millions.</v>

726
00:35:22.421 --> 00:35:24.680
<v Speaker 4>It's an annual budget.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Over $10,000,000,000.</v>

727
00:35:24.681 --> 00:35:27.920
<v Speaker 4>We have a team of people working a bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>over 10 billion for $8,000.</v>

728
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.070
<v Speaker 4>It's almost as much as because it gave </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

729
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:35.840
<v Speaker 4>What you're saying is it's an industry </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's no way to stop this industry</v>

730
00:35:35.841 --> 00:35:40.841
<v Speaker 4>with the truth that these are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>willing to look at the truth because </v>

731
00:35:40.841 --> 00:35:42.390
<v Speaker 4>there's a massive amount of money that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>being spent perpetrating a lie.</v>

732
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:47.450
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When did journalist or any scientists </v>

733
00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:49.080
<v Speaker 4>really speaks up and sweat this year in </v>
<v Speaker 4>income DC?</v>

734
00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.830
<v Speaker 4>Immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Olga Kay,</v>

735
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:52.590
<v Speaker 4>molly's junkie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy guy,</v>

736
00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:57.610
<v Speaker 4>disbursed Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What have you mastered it so they have </v>

737
00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:58.830
<v Speaker 4>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is kind of pulling it out.</v>

738
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.180
<v Speaker 3>It did have an epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

739
00:36:00.181 --> 00:36:01.600
<v Speaker 3>we did have an AIDS epidemic.</v>

740
00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.350
<v Speaker 4>I remember you saying that it coincides </v>
<v Speaker 4>with drug.</v>

741
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.310
<v Speaker 4>People are still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You remember the crack epidemic,</v>

742
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:12.320
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember that very distinct thing that </v>

743
00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.880
<v Speaker 4>happened when crack your whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've had epidemics,</v>

744
00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:19.060
<v Speaker 4>but the whole youth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the large large scale use of </v>

745
00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:21.500
<v Speaker 4>recreational drugs was known in America </v>
<v Speaker 4>after Vietnam.</v>

746
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:27.020
<v Speaker 4>Then he came back somewhat more open to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the rest of the world as before known </v>

747
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:33.790
<v Speaker 4>familiarized with drugs from Vietnam and</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolution by losing the war,</v>

748
00:36:34.581 --> 00:36:37.780
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then all of a sudden tuck it.</v>

749
00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.750
<v Speaker 4>Tuck epidemic picked up or the did </v>
<v Speaker 4>stated the yellow submarine.</v>

750
00:36:41.751 --> 00:36:42.950
<v Speaker 4>Did it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody liked it,</v>

751
00:36:42.951 --> 00:36:45.650
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was.</v>

752
00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.980
<v Speaker 4>That was the place for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was coming in the seventies,</v>

753
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.040
<v Speaker 4>in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all of a sudden we have aids.</v>

754
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:54.950
<v Speaker 4>It's all talked related.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It.</v>

755
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.870
<v Speaker 4>What if it were a sexually transmitted </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease?</v>

756
00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:03.220
<v Speaker 4>We have four and a half million </v>
<v Speaker 4>heterosexually produced babies in this </v>

757
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:09.390
<v Speaker 4>conduct to Duesberg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can just try to talk into the </v>

758
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.390
<v Speaker 4>microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

759
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.390
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's tone.</v>

760
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:10.550
<v Speaker 4>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's lots of heterosexual sex.</v>

761
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.270
<v Speaker 4>What does the virus have?</v>

762
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:14.730
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you there's an answer.</v>

763
00:37:14.731 --> 00:37:18.780
<v Speaker 3>There's an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because in Africa it was a.</v>

764
00:37:18.781 --> 00:37:22.390
<v Speaker 3>It was a heterosexual disease in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States and Europe.</v>

765
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:27.490
<v Speaker 3>Europe had never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if there's a lecture about it and </v>

766
00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:27.810
<v Speaker 3>see what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't figure it out.</v>

767
00:37:27.811 --> 00:37:30.290
<v Speaker 3>What was it was their secondary </v>
<v Speaker 3>infection was a poor healthcare.</v>

768
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:32.190
<v Speaker 3>Why in the world we're straight men in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa,</v>

769
00:37:32.191 --> 00:37:36.300
<v Speaker 3>getting it by the drugs and the the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cases for straight men in the United</v>

770
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:41.300
<v Speaker 3>States are vanishing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're talking about gay men and </v>

771
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:41.300
<v Speaker 3>intravenous drug use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm saying,</v>

772
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:43.790
<v Speaker 3>here's what they found.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colleagues,</v>

773
00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.870
<v Speaker 3>executive trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not with six and not with,</v>

774
00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:51.110
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what I read and maybe you can </v>

775
00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:51.110
<v Speaker 3>help me with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

776
00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:51.110
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Juan Enriquez,</v>

777
00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:53.730
<v Speaker 3>who was a venture capitalists who invest</v>
<v Speaker 3>in different kinds of medical technology</v>

778
00:37:53.731 --> 00:37:54.990
<v Speaker 3>and deals with all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

779
00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.170
<v Speaker 3>what they found was there was a genetic.</v>

780
00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:03.920
<v Speaker 3>There was a genetic variation in all </v>
<v Speaker 3>people of northern European extraction </v>

781
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.971
<v Speaker 3>who had survived the black plague.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That particular genetic variation makes </v>

782
00:38:07.971 --> 00:38:11.931
<v Speaker 3>you very resistant to the HIV virus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only way a straight man gets HIV is </v>

783
00:38:11.971 --> 00:38:16.971
<v Speaker 3>if it's pushed into his bloodstream with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a needle or through anal sex or </v>

784
00:38:17.341 --> 00:38:19.320
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or blood transfusion,</v>

785
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:24.710
<v Speaker 3>having regular vaginal sex with a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in fact even gay men who were having</v>

786
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:29.730
<v Speaker 3>doing the actual fucking doing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual sex as opposed to getting it were</v>

787
00:38:29.731 --> 00:38:33.750
<v Speaker 3>the ones that survived the epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there is no question that that,</v>

788
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 3>that however,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Africa,</v>

789
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:40.770
<v Speaker 3>in Subsaharan Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did not go through the bubonic </v>

790
00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:43.870
<v Speaker 3>plagues that that we did in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did not develop that variation in </v>

791
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:48.331
<v Speaker 3>their genes and that's why they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That variation is missing in their </v>

792
00:38:48.331 --> 00:38:51.841
<v Speaker 3>genetic structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they get aids and that's why </v>

793
00:38:51.841 --> 00:38:51.841
<v Speaker 3>the and that was the.</v>

794
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:55.980
<v Speaker 4>Any genetic explanation like that is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>taco suspicious.</v>

795
00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.790
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come ditching.</v>

796
00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.470
<v Speaker 4>The genes are different between </v>
<v Speaker 4>homosexuals and heterosexuals.</v>

797
00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:03.310
<v Speaker 4>That is not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

798
00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:09.350
<v Speaker 4>They would have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's different genes are having </v>

799
00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:12.831
<v Speaker 4>different sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr Duesberg I'm sorry to keep reminding </v>

800
00:39:12.831 --> 00:39:12.831
<v Speaker 4>you of tuck cells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you talk into the microphone?</v>

801
00:39:12.831 --> 00:39:17.810
<v Speaker 4>We really want to hear you complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the any of the genetic argument says </v>

802
00:39:18.411 --> 00:39:23.411
<v Speaker 4>it is very suspicious that in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>population to homosexuals would have </v>

803
00:39:23.411 --> 00:39:24.860
<v Speaker 4>changed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A different sections.</v>

804
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:27.060
<v Speaker 4>We have a that that's not what he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>

805
00:39:27.061 --> 00:39:32.061
<v Speaker 4>What he's saying is that there are </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain certain people that got it </v>

806
00:39:32.061 --> 00:39:33.320
<v Speaker 4>through heterosexual means like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

807
00:39:33.321 --> 00:39:38.190
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have this genetic variation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that in America there is</v>

808
00:39:38.191 --> 00:39:42.450
<v Speaker 4>no job and no way in the whole planet </v>
<v Speaker 4>even know heterosexual.</v>

809
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:47.510
<v Speaker 4>It's everyday deputy Dick didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>and scared everybody is going to split </v>

810
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:52.161
<v Speaker 4>into heterosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden even mainstream </v>

811
00:39:52.161 --> 00:39:55.551
<v Speaker 4>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the public in whatever it is we're </v>

812
00:39:55.551 --> 00:39:58.341
<v Speaker 4>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even the John Wayne talk to regular </v>

813
00:39:58.341 --> 00:39:58.620
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to do something.</v>

814
00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.760
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our Kit's going to come on with eight.</v>

815
00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:06.810
<v Speaker 4>Yes and nothing ever happened and is </v>
<v Speaker 4>sexy as or excuse as they used to be.</v>

816
00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:07.700
<v Speaker 4>They produce.</v>

817
00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:14.040
<v Speaker 4>They produce four to $5 million babies a</v>
<v Speaker 4>year and none of them get a no,</v>

818
00:40:14.041 --> 00:40:14.980
<v Speaker 4>but the data wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

819
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.480
<v Speaker 3>all to the one I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the ICS.</v>

820
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:21.660
<v Speaker 3>The explanation for mainstream science </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be the reason gay men get aids is </v>

821
00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:21.940
<v Speaker 3>because there's something called high </v>
<v Speaker 3>risk,</v>

822
00:40:21.941 --> 00:40:25.990
<v Speaker 3>low risk behavior when you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>unprotected anal sex with another man.</v>

823
00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.360
<v Speaker 3>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are.</v>

824
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

825
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:34.360
<v Speaker 4>You are those capital areas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are micro tears and the semen that</v>

826
00:40:34.361 --> 00:40:39.361
<v Speaker 4>carries the virus can actually push it </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the bloodstream that that would be </v>

827
00:40:39.361 --> 00:40:40.210
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be like anal sex.</v>

828
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.330
<v Speaker 4>It's more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but wait a minute from nowadays,</v>

829
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.690
<v Speaker 4>since you get porno movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get it on your laptop.</v>

830
00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:52.370
<v Speaker 4>The girls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you can get your hands on your </v>

831
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:53.060
<v Speaker 4>lap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

832
00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.080
<v Speaker 4>It's a serious discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is very serious,</v>

833
00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.460
<v Speaker 4>but you see the girls getting into any </v>
<v Speaker 4>code.</v>

834
00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:05.780
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of them make a profession out of </v>

835
00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.020
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of these to pawn stars.</v>

836
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:12.490
<v Speaker 4>That's what I call my favorite poets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're saying they don't get no </v>

837
00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:17.620
<v Speaker 4>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll put.</v>

838
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:20.470
<v Speaker 4>That's another prediction of the NIH </v>
<v Speaker 4>failed.</v>

839
00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.170
<v Speaker 4>All the prostitutes will be the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>one you hear.</v>

840
00:41:23.171 --> 00:41:26.440
<v Speaker 4>What did you hear?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The new laws that just got passed?</v>

841
00:41:26.441 --> 00:41:31.441
<v Speaker 4>Measure b passed last I heard he saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>no more.</v>

842
00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 4>No more porn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not going</v>

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.530
<v Speaker 1>to call her and is going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start doing in Nevada.</v>

844
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:39.020
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing is they're saying you</v>

845
00:41:39.021 --> 00:41:41.300
<v Speaker 1>have to wear condoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dental dams,</v>

846
00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:46.360
<v Speaker 1>a dental dams to world men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men Dental dams during even worse is </v>

847
00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.191
<v Speaker 1>that there's even something in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that says that if you're a husband and </v>

848
00:41:51.191 --> 00:41:54.521
<v Speaker 1>wife and you just want to broadcast sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a Webcam to our economy in your own </v>

849
00:41:54.521 --> 00:41:58.301
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a permit that costs </v>

850
00:41:58.301 --> 00:41:58.301
<v Speaker 1>like 8,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of money.</v>

851
00:41:58.301 --> 00:41:59.440
<v Speaker 1>They did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

852
00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The population did it.</v>

853
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:02.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We voted that in.</v>

854
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.960
<v Speaker 1>That's shame on us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also voted that genetically </v>

855
00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.500
<v Speaker 1>modified foods thing in it that get </v>
<v Speaker 1>voted in and I'm a fan of that person.</v>

856
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:11.990
<v Speaker 1>What is it that doesn't have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>labeled?</v>

857
00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of genetically modified foods </v>

858
00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:17.260
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:17.510
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

861
00:42:17.511 --> 00:42:22.040
<v Speaker 1>How is it that is the domain to label </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

862
00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:25.320
<v Speaker 1>You should always be transparent and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>costs no more money.</v>

863
00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:26.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a money thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a monsanto.</v>

864
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.560
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

865
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.230
<v Speaker 1>they're buying it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those sons of bitches.</v>

866
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:35.200
<v Speaker 1>So Dr Duesberg how many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people like on a.</v>

867
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.400
<v Speaker 1>When you have these conversations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

868
00:42:38.401 --> 00:42:39.890
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk about this connection.</v>

869
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.510
<v Speaker 1>How many people think you're crazy?</v>

870
00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:42.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

871
00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:46.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so sure that so many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A sure that I'm crazy.</v>

872
00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.460
<v Speaker 2>They just don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once,</v>

873
00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 2>just too hot a topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>

874
00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Face it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

875
00:42:52.321 --> 00:42:55.440
<v Speaker 2>They don't see if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my colleagues,</v>

876
00:42:55.441 --> 00:42:59.260
<v Speaker 2>my former friend Jay Levy or held or </v>
<v Speaker 2>found,</v>

877
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:00.840
<v Speaker 2>she was notified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Gallo,</v>

878
00:43:00.841 --> 00:43:04.080
<v Speaker 2>we were close friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We met several times a year.</v>

879
00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Conferences and trying foods and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>have you.</v>

880
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.290
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deep cannot talk about it with me.</v>

881
00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:13.200
<v Speaker 2>They realize they have no good answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have.</v>

882
00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:15.540
<v Speaker 2>They would have known published it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be finished.</v>

883
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:18.930
<v Speaker 2>I would not just be excommunicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically,</v>

884
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:21.590
<v Speaker 2>not get students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would pull from your home in,</v>

885
00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.560
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in lighting,</v>

886
00:43:22.561 --> 00:43:27.561
<v Speaker 2>in a scientific paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be my the end of my song and </v>

887
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:27.561
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

888
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:29.790
<v Speaker 2>your dispute status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you can't answer it,</v>

889
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:32.580
<v Speaker 2>but they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the topic.</v>

890
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:33.930
<v Speaker 2>That's why it goes on and on.</v>

891
00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.450
<v Speaker 2>They have no answers why they can't make</v>
<v Speaker 2>a vaccine.</v>

892
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:41.510
<v Speaker 2>They have no answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why the girls heterosexuals don't get </v>

893
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:42.030
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have no answers why they can't find</v>

894
00:43:42.031 --> 00:43:47.031
<v Speaker 2>the bibles and you're dying from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a complete paradox in biology,</v>

895
00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.510
<v Speaker 2>in chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact in science.</v>

896
00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:56.900
<v Speaker 2>How can you get a fatal consequence </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreman nondetectable cause that is </v>

897
00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:01.440
<v Speaker 2>absolutely electric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't not cancer that serve my God.</v>

898
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:03.660
<v Speaker 2>You look at the second sale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see a lot.</v>

899
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.780
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have 60,</v>

900
00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:10.820
<v Speaker 2>60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 chromosomes in there where there </v>

901
00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:11.970
<v Speaker 2>should be 46 mm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a big cost there.</v>

902
00:44:11.971 --> 00:44:14.500
<v Speaker 2>You can see they make protein and on an </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ehr it's a difference.</v>

903
00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.300
<v Speaker 1>You talk a little bit about cancer since</v>
<v Speaker 1>you work on it.</v>

904
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to stick to this so</v>

905
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:25.710
<v Speaker 2>they they see more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hardly any scientist wants to have a </v>

906
00:44:26.021 --> 00:44:29.080
<v Speaker 2>name in a field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is naive.</v>

907
00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Romantic as I was at and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

908
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.250
<v Speaker 2>we have to go the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't end up.</v>

909
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.620
<v Speaker 2>They have made their career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have.</v>

910
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:40.320
<v Speaker 2>They put a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get their merit increases.</v>

911
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:45.321
<v Speaker 2>They consult companies or owned </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies and they have to tell the </v>

912
00:44:45.321 --> 00:44:47.610
<v Speaker 2>postdocs and students in their company </v>
<v Speaker 2>so we on the wrong paths.</v>

913
00:44:47.611 --> 00:44:51.390
<v Speaker 2>We have started all over that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hardly anybody is able to make that.</v>

914
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:54.210
<v Speaker 2>The wives would beat them up or the kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>would say,</v>

915
00:44:54.211 --> 00:44:55.710
<v Speaker 2>where's the money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lose.</v>

916
00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:58.740
<v Speaker 2>They would lose their jobs or their </v>
<v Speaker 2>investments.</v>

917
00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:02.160
<v Speaker 2>They piss away the investments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this is true,</v>

918
00:45:02.161 --> 00:45:04.410
<v Speaker 2>how is it that you're the only one who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about this?</v>

919
00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.320
<v Speaker 2>You're not the only one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm.</v>

920
00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:10.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm as a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good friend of mine,</v>

921
00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:13.040
<v Speaker 2>a publisher from New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you been a scientist?</v>

922
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:17.850
<v Speaker 2>Also a hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was editor of nature biotechnology.</v>

923
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:22.070
<v Speaker 2>He wrote this book about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you unpack how to add butter,</v>

924
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.110
<v Speaker 2>your own pet here?</v>

925
00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:28.910
<v Speaker 2>When we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he meant it when he said this,</v>

926
00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.960
<v Speaker 2>he explained it how it happened just for</v>
<v Speaker 2>being caught an ethical scientists to </v>

927
00:45:34.321 --> 00:45:36.340
<v Speaker 2>say what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the science tells me.</v>

928
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Have you debated any other scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the subject of times in the </v>

929
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:42.420
<v Speaker 2>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the journal Science,</v>

930
00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:47.560
<v Speaker 2>there is a debate between me and Carlo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Plattner and timid and it's called </v>

931
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:50.450
<v Speaker 2>equality policy form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

932
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:55.710
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my part was called HIV is not causing </v>

933
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:55.710
<v Speaker 2>aids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

934
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:57.120
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he could answer to each other.</v>

935
00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Ones that don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they hold one more editorial about </v>

936
00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:02.490
<v Speaker 2>it and then they don't want to write </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it anymore.</v>

937
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.880
<v Speaker 2>So that's the only time you've ever sat </v>
<v Speaker 2>down with another scientist and had a </v>

938
00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:07.880
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

939
00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.590
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the only table.</v>

940
00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:13.610
<v Speaker 2>There were several other occasions here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what do they say to you?</v>

941
00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:16.600
<v Speaker 2>What is their response and what's wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with their response?</v>

942
00:46:16.601 --> 00:46:20.150
<v Speaker 2>So what is their response to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments that it's all drug related and</v>

943
00:46:20.151 --> 00:46:21.240
<v Speaker 2>then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

944
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:22.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a,</v>

945
00:46:22.741 --> 00:46:27.741
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that we can only detect it in </v>

946
00:46:27.741 --> 00:46:28.350
<v Speaker 2>the form of an antibody and saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's killing you is ridiculous.</v>

947
00:46:28.351 --> 00:46:33.351
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a Duisburg doesn't know indirect </v>

948
00:46:33.351 --> 00:46:35.610
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms in individ causes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cofactors.</v>

949
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:40.910
<v Speaker 2>And once I'm gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't mention the cofactors </v>

950
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.910
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They named me factors like drugs.</v>

951
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:42.990
<v Speaker 2>What drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle choice,</v>

952
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:44.010
<v Speaker 2>lack of sleep.</v>

953
00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:50.980
<v Speaker 3>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of doctors who are </v>

954
00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.140
<v Speaker 3>medical doctors that you go to when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have HIV and you take your drugs and </v>

955
00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.851
<v Speaker 3>they're in the trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd been there a long time and they </v>

956
00:46:57.851 --> 00:47:00.581
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are involved in prescribing you a </v>

957
00:47:00.581 --> 00:47:04.481
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of medication to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote your viral load to a </v>

958
00:47:04.481 --> 00:47:07.451
<v Speaker 3>manageable level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are people in the trenches that </v>

959
00:47:07.451 --> 00:47:11.440
<v Speaker 3>watched people die and are now keeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>people alive with those drugs.</v>

960
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:16.400
<v Speaker 3>So I'm just curious as to all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctors that are doing that in Africa,</v>

961
00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:18.800
<v Speaker 3>in Europe and the United States in East </v>
<v Speaker 3>Asia,</v>

962
00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.230
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>W w,</v>

963
00:47:20.231 --> 00:47:22.850
<v Speaker 3>w,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know there's a lot of money there,</v>

964
00:47:22.851 --> 00:47:27.851
<v Speaker 3>but they are doing that work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that if it Wasn't </v>

965
00:47:27.951 --> 00:47:31.150
<v Speaker 3>Working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they hadn't seen direct results,</v>

966
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:36.240
<v Speaker 3>and I'm talking about non drug users,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hadn't seen direct results say in </v>

967
00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.871
<v Speaker 3>africa With heterosexual men when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were dying and now they are die.</v>

968
00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.040
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me a lot of people would </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

969
00:47:42.041 --> 00:47:47.041
<v Speaker 3>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are still dying at the same rate </v>

970
00:47:47.041 --> 00:47:47.800
<v Speaker 3>or whatever it regardless of lIfestyle </v>
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>

971
00:47:47.801 --> 00:47:49.630
<v Speaker 3>people stick to their lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the most part,</v>

972
00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:55.160
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In America is the minimal amount of </v>

973
00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:58.011
<v Speaker 2>eight cases like 30,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 $0 a year and guess who they are to </v>

974
00:47:58.011 --> 00:48:02.140
<v Speaker 2>certain male homosexual sin asserta </v>
<v Speaker 2>junkies and that is because of a virus.</v>

975
00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:05.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not by the toes.</v>

976
00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:08.520
<v Speaker 2>As you say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very small population.</v>

977
00:48:08.521 --> 00:48:10.950
<v Speaker 2>It's always the same list groups and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they get these talks,</v>

978
00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:16.250
<v Speaker 2>so if you are a little scientist other </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the doctor prescribing pills and </v>

979
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:20.491
<v Speaker 2>doing what all other doctors do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>following what they call standard of </v>

980
00:48:20.491 --> 00:48:21.760
<v Speaker 2>care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you violate and say,</v>

981
00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't prescribe anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come and so you sometimes you,</v>

982
00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:27.030
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they could skype,</v>

983
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:32.510
<v Speaker 2>but what you need to prove that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>trucks are doing things in animals or in</v>

984
00:48:33.361 --> 00:48:37.020
<v Speaker 2>humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to do a controlled study,</v>

985
00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.020
<v Speaker 2>totally controlled study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have,</v>

986
00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:44.370
<v Speaker 2>let's say here and I identify with hiv </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive men,</v>

987
00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:46.710
<v Speaker 2>gay or heterosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they are,</v>

988
00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:48.690
<v Speaker 2>and they have another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another hunted,</v>

989
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.900
<v Speaker 2>matched same age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same lifestyle,</v>

990
00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:53.910
<v Speaker 2>maybe soldiers with the us army.</v>

991
00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:59.160
<v Speaker 2>You have to have two and they are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>treated and then we'll see who is doing </v>

992
00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.210
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you'll find out,</v>

993
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.010
<v Speaker 2>but when you use three talks and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>truck and that truck and that countertop</v>

994
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:07.680
<v Speaker 2>on top of them and don't comply and sold</v>
<v Speaker 2>them down the toilet,</v>

995
00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.600
<v Speaker 2>all of these stories are very well </v>
<v Speaker 2>known.</v>

996
00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:12.090
<v Speaker 2>You can only guess and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

997
00:49:12.091 --> 00:49:14.640
<v Speaker 2>my truck works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It costs a thousand dollars a month.</v>

998
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:17.880
<v Speaker 2>Very good business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's lasting three or four or five years</v>

999
00:49:17.881 --> 00:49:22.881
<v Speaker 2>until they're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the drug companies lovell </v>

1000
00:49:22.881 --> 00:49:22.881
<v Speaker 2>longer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1001
00:49:22.881 --> 00:49:25.310
<v Speaker 2>people are on average about five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't tell you that inhibitors,</v>

1002
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:28.350
<v Speaker 2>untuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people are living now.</v>

1003
00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always know somebody like magic </v>

1004
00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.901
<v Speaker 2>johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gaining weight and I saw a lot of </v>

1005
00:49:35.901 --> 00:49:38.211
<v Speaker 2>people die in six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven months is in the eighties and </v>

1006
00:49:38.211 --> 00:49:38.211
<v Speaker 2>nineties night I've never seen that.</v>

1007
00:49:38.211 --> 00:49:41.560
<v Speaker 2>Even now they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only when they faithfully take those</v>

1008
00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:43.830
<v Speaker 2>plugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they often say they do and then they</v>

1009
00:49:43.831 --> 00:49:46.250
<v Speaker 2>don't have a microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a.</v>

1010
00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:50.430
<v Speaker 2>It is in order to prove what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying and what they tell you,</v>

1011
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.920
<v Speaker 2>all their trucks works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love to sell those stocks.</v>

1012
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:55.740
<v Speaker 2>It's real good business and thousand </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar month.</v>

1013
00:49:56.070 --> 00:50:01.070
<v Speaker 2>That's what for the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what our companies love </v>

1014
00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:02.140
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like chemotherapy.</v>

1015
00:50:02.141 --> 00:50:07.141
<v Speaker 2>it's also a thousand dollars a month </v>
<v Speaker 2>except it doesn't use the last that </v>

1016
00:50:07.141 --> 00:50:08.670
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what you need in order to pull if it</v>

1017
00:50:08.671 --> 00:50:11.820
<v Speaker 2>works and have a hell of a time within </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>

1018
00:50:11.821 --> 00:50:14.340
<v Speaker 2>they've never done it done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was eight.</v>

1019
00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:18.420
<v Speaker 2>They did it once in 87 and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences,</v>

1020
00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:21.810
<v Speaker 2>the results were very devastating to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people on set.</v>

1021
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:27.230
<v Speaker 2>A 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 percent of them were dying while </v>

1022
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.880
<v Speaker 2>they're treating them and they only get </v>
<v Speaker 2>easy,</v>

1023
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:28.310
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>

1024
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't effective what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say that's what the admit now,</v>

1025
00:50:32.271 --> 00:50:35.910
<v Speaker 2>but for years they this audio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a denialist you.</v>

1026
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:39.080
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the words they use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when they see they was always</v>

1027
00:50:39.081 --> 00:50:44.081
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you took it and you just hoped that it </v>

1028
00:50:44.081 --> 00:50:44.300
<v Speaker 2>kept you alive a little longer than they</v>
<v Speaker 2>give.</v>

1029
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:48.020
<v Speaker 2>These companies are toy treatments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood transfusions.</v>

1030
00:50:48.021 --> 00:50:53.021
<v Speaker 2>Many of them because their bone marrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>was gone from act look really good.</v>

1031
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:57.020
<v Speaker 2>then two years later they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

1032
00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:02.150
<v Speaker 2>but it takes a while to develop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're asking your doctor,</v>

1033
00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:09.310
<v Speaker 2>show me a tItle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific study where you have treated </v>

1034
00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.370
<v Speaker 2>and untreated and show me that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>treated ones live longer,</v>

1035
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.180
<v Speaker 2>even one day longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see why.</v>

1036
00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.720
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of evidence to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1037
00:51:17.721 --> 00:51:22.721
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have days none.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no such study except the oil </v>

1038
00:51:22.721 --> 00:51:26.771
<v Speaker 2>you to act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you already pushed aside a little </v>

1039
00:51:26.771 --> 00:51:27.680
<v Speaker 2>bit because you heard it the first time </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

1040
00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:28.980
<v Speaker 2>You have much improved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy,</v>

1041
00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:34.050
<v Speaker 2>tina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did act is still terminating dna </v>

1042
00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:36.371
<v Speaker 2>synthesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You use less now because you don't want </v>

1043
00:51:36.371 --> 00:51:36.371
<v Speaker 2>to die during the trial,</v>

1044
00:51:36.371 --> 00:51:37.190
<v Speaker 1>so you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're.</v>

1045
00:51:37.191 --> 00:51:40.520
<v Speaker 1>You're explaining it as if it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy,</v>

1046
00:51:40.521 --> 00:51:43.700
<v Speaker 1>like they all are aware of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're poisoning them less to keep them</v>

1047
00:51:43.701 --> 00:51:48.701
<v Speaker 1>around longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they know they're selling the </v>

1048
00:51:48.701 --> 00:51:48.701
<v Speaker 1>poison.</v>

1049
00:51:48.701 --> 00:51:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Don't know whether they all totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of it.</v>

1050
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:53.770
<v Speaker 2>How is it someone has to be aware of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciously lower the dose to keep </v>

1051
00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:53.770
<v Speaker 2>people alive longer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1052
00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:55.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1053
00:51:55.791 --> 00:51:57.950
<v Speaker 2>How conscious do you hear it from all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sides?</v>

1054
00:51:57.951 --> 00:51:58.850
<v Speaker 2>You believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1055
00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:00.070
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1056
00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:04.150
<v Speaker 2>I think there were a lot of good </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers in sterling.</v>

1057
00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.300
<v Speaker 2>He could have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1058
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.950
<v Speaker 2>let's stop this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go home.</v>

1059
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:12.490
<v Speaker 2>So it takes awhile to change your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took 1945 and another 10 million.</v>

1060
00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:19.130
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you think that all these scientists </v>

1061
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:20.040
<v Speaker 1>are aware of this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all these people who are working in</v>

1062
00:52:20.041 --> 00:52:23.140
<v Speaker 1>the hiv aids field or in denial or do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think it</v>

1063
00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.540
<v Speaker 2>denied?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to use these words.</v>

1064
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:28.770
<v Speaker 2>They're not that clear headed that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be in denial.</v>

1065
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:32.430
<v Speaker 2>They have heard it so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each job so terrible.</v>

1066
00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Even act and tuck designed to kill human</v>
<v Speaker 2>cells.</v>

1067
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:39.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a picnic compared to hiv to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1068
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:45.500
<v Speaker 2>but then you ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about the 30 percent of africans </v>

1069
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.060
<v Speaker 2>who are said to be hiv positive or 40 or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever high percentage.</v>

1070
00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Why on data?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1071
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:55.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a different strain comes to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story that you had played for high </v>

1072
00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:58.851
<v Speaker 2>founded years ago and whatever this put </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheet of buying something or what have </v>

1073
00:52:59.311 --> 00:53:04.311
<v Speaker 2>you done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might tell you that they are dying </v>

1074
00:53:04.311 --> 00:53:04.311
<v Speaker 2>And now they're not because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

1075
00:53:04.311 --> 00:53:06.520
<v Speaker 2>That's what they would tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have that many talks enough.</v>

1076
00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:12.350
<v Speaker 2>Not even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even bill gates and burst webcam </v>

1077
00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:16.770
<v Speaker 2>could have pleaded so many people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>makeup and make him wait.</v>

1078
00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:20.310
<v Speaker 2>They have now from 450 to one point 2 </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion.</v>

1079
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:25.220
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty good for a wireless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1080
00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:29.990
<v Speaker 5>South africa's population is growing,</v>

1081
00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:35.220
<v Speaker 2>exploding going is actually putting it </v>
<v Speaker 2>very mildly from 450 to over.</v>

1082
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:41.150
<v Speaker 5>The only other explanation is there </v>
<v Speaker 5>making super aids and they're going </v>

1083
00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:43.290
<v Speaker 5>bring it over here and it does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't kill them.</v>

1084
00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:47.750
<v Speaker 5>A different strain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They found it's the same test stop.</v>

1085
00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:49.620
<v Speaker 5>You're doing lies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a super.</v>

1086
00:53:49.621 --> 00:53:52.320
<v Speaker 5>Aids is going to kill us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not them in the africans.</v>

1087
00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:57.640
<v Speaker 5>Is there a similarity to you between the</v>
<v Speaker 5>what your research with cancer and with </v>

1088
00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:57.960
<v Speaker 5>aids?</v>

1089
00:53:58.290 --> 00:53:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure it is.</v>

1090
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:04.280
<v Speaker 2>It came from the same starting point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I mentioned briefly when I first </v>

1091
00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:08.751
<v Speaker 2>came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hot thing intensity search was to </v>

1092
00:54:08.751 --> 00:54:11.871
<v Speaker 2>find cancer biosis and that's what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>came you trying to find the house and </v>

1093
00:54:11.871 --> 00:54:15.160
<v Speaker 2>the houses were the top of the basic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1094
00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:20.570
<v Speaker 2>Cancer was a retrovirus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember reading that got did two </v>

1095
00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:23.000
<v Speaker 2>miles was the most popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I came in studying that </v>

1096
00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:28.700
<v Speaker 2>because it wasn't killing cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unlike most viruses like polio and soap </v>

1097
00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:33.780
<v Speaker 2>and flew into measles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mumps,</v>

1098
00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:35.600
<v Speaker 2>fifth kills assemblies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These replIcates that,</v>

1099
00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:40.110
<v Speaker 2>they killed the cells and replicate in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying cells and then kill more,</v>

1100
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:44.940
<v Speaker 2>but let's have a strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They essentially move into it,</v>

1101
00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:48.810
<v Speaker 2>like you're engrossed would move into </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and they stay.</v>

1102
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:53.370
<v Speaker 2>They stay part of the senate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially tax it a little bit inside,</v>

1103
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:56.180
<v Speaker 2>but very little there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So mooches.</v>

1104
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:58.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so muchin past luci cells,</v>

1105
00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:03.390
<v Speaker 2>they don't seriously did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do much.</v>

1106
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:05.930
<v Speaker 2>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they are neutralized by antibody.</v>

1107
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:08.520
<v Speaker 2>You cannot even find it valuable when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look hard enough.</v>

1108
00:55:08.521 --> 00:55:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Like with the methods we use no viral </v>
<v Speaker 2>load.</v>

1109
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:15.740
<v Speaker 2>All this bullshit work expressions for </v>
<v Speaker 2>finding a needle in a haystack that they</v>

1110
00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:19.620
<v Speaker 2>don't do anything in any sales and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're ubiquitous.</v>

1111
00:55:19.621 --> 00:55:21.470
<v Speaker 2>You find them in cows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find them in docs,</v>

1112
00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:25.410
<v Speaker 2>you find him and find him in whites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You find in monkeys what kills you with,</v>

1113
00:55:25.411 --> 00:55:30.411
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with cancer and what cancer is a very </v>

1114
00:55:30.411 --> 00:55:31.420
<v Speaker 2>serious different business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you have one sale,</v>

1115
00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:36.560
<v Speaker 2>one not thousands or millions infected </v>
<v Speaker 2>one that changes its chromosome.</v>

1116
00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.160
<v Speaker 2>That is possibly the solid of a casino.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinos,</v>

1117
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:45.210
<v Speaker 2>some excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And normally we have 46.</v>

1118
00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:47.340
<v Speaker 2>All of our sales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>46.</v>

1119
00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Then they behave when the pope comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work with and the controls work with </v>

1120
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.940
<v Speaker 2>into building years of turning up of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1121
00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:59.210
<v Speaker 2>They've worked pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you change one out and make a new </v>

1122
00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:00.750
<v Speaker 2>species and it screws up all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>controls.</v>

1123
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:06.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a very different set attributable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Presto call on or lung cancer has 60,</v>

1124
00:56:07.201 --> 00:56:10.410
<v Speaker 2>70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 chromosomes instead of 46.</v>

1125
00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:14.750
<v Speaker 2>All controlled health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or do you.</v>

1126
00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:17.790
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe in chemotherapy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1127
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About it there you'll have side effects.</v>

1128
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:26.140
<v Speaker 2>That's a good word for side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It detects cancer,</v>

1129
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:31.800
<v Speaker 2>but for sure the cap tax you too because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no chemotherapy that can tell </v>

1130
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:38.600
<v Speaker 2>the dna of species or from a cancer cell</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just came out of your own.</v>

1131
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Distinguish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot distinguish,</v>

1132
00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:46.050
<v Speaker 2>so the only edge you have and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemotherapies that the cancer is </v>

1133
00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:50.310
<v Speaker 2>relentlessly coin and in adults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of your cells are not going or it's</v>

1134
00:56:50.921 --> 00:56:52.700
<v Speaker 2>just staying equilibrium.</v>

1135
00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:56.710
<v Speaker 2>You don't code anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't work.</v>

1136
00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:57.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

1137
00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.320
<v Speaker 2>My chairman of my accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk.</v>

1138
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Gaining insights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Replicate.</v>

1139
00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:04.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>replicated.</v>

1140
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:07.420
<v Speaker 2>so those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the chemotherapy works on,</v>

1141
00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:11.470
<v Speaker 2>on replicating sense and the little edge</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have is your heart.</v>

1142
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:14.440
<v Speaker 2>Your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your lungs,</v>

1143
00:57:14.441 --> 00:57:19.441
<v Speaker 2>even they don't call in adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they replace things here and then the </v>

1144
00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:20.560
<v Speaker 2>plot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the skin,</v>

1145
00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:23.560
<v Speaker 2>the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call everyday like casey and that's</v>

1146
00:57:23.561 --> 00:57:28.561
<v Speaker 2>where you see the effects of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemotherapy first to become immune </v>

1147
00:57:28.561 --> 00:57:28.561
<v Speaker 2>deficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lose hail,</v>

1148
00:57:28.561 --> 00:57:32.920
<v Speaker 2>they lose weight as exactly as the guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>you describe when they take act in these</v>

1149
00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:37.930
<v Speaker 2>trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cannot keep their food anymore </v>

1150
00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:38.360
<v Speaker 2>because the intestines or school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is your.</v>

1151
00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:43.380
<v Speaker 2>What are your thoughts on the new age?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ideas of what keeping the body alkaline </v>

1152
00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:44.860
<v Speaker 2>to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cancers are bullshit.</v>

1153
00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:47.790
<v Speaker 2>I doubt it will work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1154
00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:52.810
<v Speaker 2>you don't believe in like iot is </v>
<v Speaker 2>antioxidants,</v>

1155
00:57:54.611 --> 00:57:55.290
<v Speaker 2>first of all.</v>

1156
00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.750
<v Speaker 2>That's good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1157
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:59.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't work.</v>

1158
00:57:59.561 --> 00:58:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Me keeping the body alkaline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't really follow all the rules</v>

1159
00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:07.710
<v Speaker 2>that my grandmother gave me come home </v>
<v Speaker 2>early and to sleep well and it's.</v>

1160
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:14.280
<v Speaker 2>It could dive then you're doing all you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do to what you do.</v>

1161
00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:17.200
<v Speaker 2>Eat meat and stuff and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1162
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:19.750
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat less than I used to.</v>

1163
00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:22.780
<v Speaker 2>You don't need as much not pick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

1164
00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's sort of terrifying as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1165
00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Knowing as much as you know about </v>
<v Speaker 2>viruses or is it terrifying like being a</v>

1166
00:58:31.901 --> 00:58:34.210
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like thinking about your body constantly</v>

1167
00:58:34.211 --> 00:58:38.050
<v Speaker 2>at war with all these different invading</v>
<v Speaker 2>armies that are trying to kill it.</v>

1168
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:40.150
<v Speaker 2>That's what these viruses are </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>

1169
00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:44.500
<v Speaker 2>but we have emerged out of a ocean of </v>
<v Speaker 2>microbes and viruses,</v>

1170
00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:49.960
<v Speaker 2>but syp at hip because we have an immune</v>
<v Speaker 2>system that is totally equipped to go to</v>

1171
00:58:50.771 --> 00:58:55.150
<v Speaker 2>war to to keep them down for 300 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 years.</v>

1172
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:58.960
<v Speaker 2>That shit starts falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who dies from an infectious disease it's</v>

1173
00:58:58.961 --> 00:58:59.380
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1174
00:58:59.381 --> 00:59:01.360
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this society is hardly anything.</v>

1175
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:06.840
<v Speaker 2>The last serious infectious disease </v>
<v Speaker 2>epidemic was flu in 1988 at a time when </v>

1176
00:59:07.751 --> 00:59:11.110
<v Speaker 2>we didn't have vaccines yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know dna and rna and proteins.</v>

1177
00:59:11.111 --> 00:59:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Yet we didn't even know dietary </v>
<v Speaker 2>vaccines.</v>

1178
00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Vaccines have been the most amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>invention that now after world war two </v>

1179
00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:21.860
<v Speaker 2>when there isn't any polio.</v>

1180
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Polio had a little deep theory of </v>
<v Speaker 3>whooping cough,</v>

1181
00:59:27.141 --> 00:59:30.830
<v Speaker 3>pertussis and measles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1182
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:35.890
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that is always under </v>
<v Speaker 3>underlooked when you read history is </v>

1183
00:59:35.890 --> 00:59:36.080
<v Speaker 3>that most people you read about in </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

1184
00:59:36.081 --> 00:59:38.240
<v Speaker 3>including presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kings,</v>

1185
00:59:38.330 --> 00:59:41.810
<v Speaker 3>peasants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ability all lost at least one child.</v>

1186
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:47.410
<v Speaker 3>That was a huge part oF of the of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>character of our ancestors are very </v>

1187
00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:52.751
<v Speaker 3>recent ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had all lost at least one child </v>

1188
00:59:52.751 --> 00:59:52.751
<v Speaker 3>child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you have children,</v>

1189
00:59:52.751 --> 00:59:57.731
<v Speaker 3>you know how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how epic and how tragic that would be </v>

1190
00:59:57.731 --> 00:59:59.180
<v Speaker 3>and how unthinkable it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All,</v>

1191
00:59:59.181 --> 01:00:00.200
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1192
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:04.040
<v Speaker 3>most of our presidents are the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were the elite,</v>

1193
01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:07.190
<v Speaker 3>the most wealthiest of it touched </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone.</v>

1194
01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:10.870
<v Speaker 3>It touches everyone and that's something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we.</v>

1195
01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.190
<v Speaker 3>We are very lucky to not have to lIve </v>
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

1196
01:00:13.191 --> 01:00:15.260
<v Speaker 3>For most of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have answers.</v>

1197
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:18.590
<v Speaker 3>We hAve answers for those pathogens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>answers for those viruses,</v>

1198
01:00:18.591 --> 01:00:20.020
<v Speaker 3>answers for those epidemics.</v>

1199
01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Biochemistry didn't have biochemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know what he takes to </v>

1200
01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:29.801
<v Speaker 3>maintain an optimal immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even even if you eat so called junk </v>

1201
01:00:29.871 --> 01:00:31.520
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now in burger king,</v>

1202
01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:35.030
<v Speaker 3>get salad leaf there with some tomato </v>
<v Speaker 3>slice.</v>

1203
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.030
<v Speaker 3>It may not be there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we didn't know it costs.</v>

1204
01:00:37.031 --> 01:00:40.980
<v Speaker 3>Garvey didn't know vitamin c deficiency </v>
<v Speaker 3>that queen victoria,</v>

1205
01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:43.040
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of booths and schnapps in </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

1206
01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:48.050
<v Speaker 3>seven except poor coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't have a banana or half a </v>

1207
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:48.050
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1208
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:53.410
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that post why the mortality and the </v>

1209
01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:55.360
<v Speaker 3>susceptibility to infectious diseases </v>
<v Speaker 3>was much higher.</v>

1210
01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:59.970
<v Speaker 3>The old days when you didn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>antibiotics of course,</v>

1211
01:00:59.971 --> 01:01:04.540
<v Speaker 3>and you didn't have any anesthesia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anesthesia made.</v>

1212
01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:09.960
<v Speaker 3>We've made great inroads and you give a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of credence as we've talked to you </v>

1213
01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.430
<v Speaker 3>give.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very interesting to hear you talk </v>

1214
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.430
<v Speaker 3>because you're so mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're very.</v>

1215
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:16.610
<v Speaker 3>You give a great deal of credit to a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of mainstream science.</v>

1216
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:21.950
<v Speaker 3>Where you deviate is in one area which </v>
<v Speaker 3>is this like a he listening to you speak</v>

1217
01:01:21.951 --> 01:01:26.770
<v Speaker 3>about the effective nature of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemotherapy on a virus on,</v>

1218
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:27.310
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1219
01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:32.340
<v Speaker 3>on cancer for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where you veer off is very specific and </v>

1220
01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.550
<v Speaker 3>that is in the question of does hiv </v>
<v Speaker 3>causes aids?</v>

1221
01:01:34.551 --> 01:01:39.551
<v Speaker 3>So I listened to you and you're so lucid</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're so scientific is trying to </v>

1222
01:01:39.891 --> 01:01:41.440
<v Speaker 3>say you're crazy without being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1223
01:01:41.441 --> 01:01:41.900
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1224
01:01:41.901 --> 01:01:42.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1225
01:01:42.561 --> 01:01:43.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is that what's what's,</v>

1226
01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:49.060
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting to me is that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you clearly are a scientist who is </v>

1227
01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.180
<v Speaker 3>immersed himself in the traditional </v>
<v Speaker 3>notion of,</v>

1228
01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:53.210
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of peer reviewed study,</v>

1229
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.990
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1230
01:01:53.991 --> 01:01:58.991
<v Speaker 3>of double blind study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Changed the way you look at this </v>

1231
01:01:58.991 --> 01:01:59.330
<v Speaker 3>argument for not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not yet.</v>

1232
01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm not a scientist.</v>

1233
01:02:01.401 --> 01:02:06.401
<v Speaker 3>I don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have somebody on the other side here </v>

1234
01:02:06.401 --> 01:02:06.401
<v Speaker 3>sitting here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything.</v>

1235
01:02:06.401 --> 01:02:06.401
<v Speaker 3>I just read stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1236
01:02:06.401 --> 01:02:11.020
<v Speaker 3>What do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what he's talking </v>

1237
01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:11.020
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1238
01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:11.020
<v Speaker 3>I can parent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1239
01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:11.160
<v Speaker 3>your articles are you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>

1240
01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:14.990
<v Speaker 3>I buy my own experience where I did with</v>
<v Speaker 3>my own eyes.</v>

1241
01:02:14.991 --> 01:02:16.810
<v Speaker 3>See young men die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1242
01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 3>a lot by the droves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw them die and</v>

1243
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.700
<v Speaker 5>then I saw them get better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But not many of those young men.</v>

1244
01:02:23.701 --> 01:02:28.701
<v Speaker 5>We didn't really get to this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many of those young men were not </v>

1245
01:02:28.701 --> 01:02:28.701
<v Speaker 5>doing drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many of them?</v>

1246
01:02:28.701 --> 01:02:30.480
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you had a gas.</v>

1247
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:35.600
<v Speaker 5>Any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of men that I knew who died who </v>

1248
01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.080
<v Speaker 5>were dancers and who we're targeting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not necessarily drug addicts,</v>

1249
01:02:37.081 --> 01:02:38.610
<v Speaker 5>but they partied.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We partied a lot.</v>

1250
01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:41.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Having having said that,</v>

1251
01:02:41.161 --> 01:02:45.060
<v Speaker 5>having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when even those drug addicts even.</v>

1252
01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:45.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1253
01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:47.460
<v Speaker 5>the gay community still does a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>drugs.</v>

1254
01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:48.920
<v Speaker 5>They do a lot of math.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do a lot.</v>

1255
01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:54.350
<v Speaker 5>They do a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no question that you can ask </v>

1256
01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:56.391
<v Speaker 5>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the fact of the matter is even with </v>

1257
01:02:56.391 --> 01:02:56.391
<v Speaker 5>that drug use,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you go to the abbey,</v>

1258
01:02:56.391 --> 01:02:58.320
<v Speaker 5>if you go to these places on in west </v>
<v Speaker 5>hollywood,</v>

1259
01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:01.620
<v Speaker 5>they're not dying by the drugs the way </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were in the eighties and nineties.</v>

1260
01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:06.650
<v Speaker 5>That's where I have a disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where I have trouble buying your </v>

1261
01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:08.070
<v Speaker 5>theory because it's my own now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be careful by the way,</v>

1262
01:03:08.071 --> 01:03:13.071
<v Speaker 5>deducing from your own experience and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>know that because you're going to have </v>

1263
01:03:13.071 --> 01:03:13.980
<v Speaker 5>to start doing more gay research.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

1264
01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:15.930
<v Speaker 5>By limited,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very limited.</v>

1265
01:03:15.931 --> 01:03:20.931
<v Speaker 5>Some leather pants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that strikes me is where you're </v>

1266
01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:23.400
<v Speaker 5>getting a lot of resistance because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>

1267
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:26.580
<v Speaker 5>You are clearly a mainstream scientists </v>
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of ways you just.</v>

1268
01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:31.610
<v Speaker 5>You just happened to have this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this theory on it and it's interesting </v>

1269
01:03:31.610 --> 01:03:31.610
<v Speaker 5>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's actually,</v>

1270
01:03:31.610 --> 01:03:34.200
<v Speaker 5>it's very interesting to me that you are</v>
<v Speaker 5>just interesting.</v>

1271
01:03:34.201 --> 01:03:34.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't know enough.</v>

1272
01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Qc meet coldly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>collect the seesaw.</v>

1273
01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my arguments are completely conservative</v>

1274
01:03:41.281 --> 01:03:42.180
<v Speaker 2>arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

1275
01:03:42.181 --> 01:03:43.420
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a deacon.</v>

1276
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:47.670
<v Speaker 2>Crazy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm presenting them with a hundred years</v>

1277
01:03:47.671 --> 01:03:50.210
<v Speaker 2>of science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so our loads,</v>

1278
01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:55.220
<v Speaker 2>if you like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show me one microbe or one virus that </v>

1279
01:03:55.291 --> 01:04:00.291
<v Speaker 2>causes a fatal disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it's neutralized by antibody and </v>

1280
01:04:00.291 --> 01:04:01.770
<v Speaker 2>you see it making dna and rna and </v>
<v Speaker 2>potent.</v>

1281
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:07.490
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there's no effect in biology or</v>

1282
01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:09.960
<v Speaker 2>in chemistry without the cost.</v>

1283
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:13.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure this is going to be a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>controversial podcast.</v>

1284
01:04:13.651 --> 01:04:16.350
<v Speaker 5>We're going to get people far smarter </v>
<v Speaker 5>than us that are going to want.</v>

1285
01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:21.370
<v Speaker 5>I don't disagree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would you be willing to come back again </v>

1286
01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:22.500
<v Speaker 5>and have another scientist in here and </v>
<v Speaker 5>talk about it and have a little debate?</v>

1287
01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:27.830
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You dirty bitches in the scientific </v>

1288
01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:27.830
<v Speaker 5>community.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A challenge has been raised.</v>

1289
01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:27.830
<v Speaker 5>It's been raised,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1290
01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:27.830
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1292
01:04:28.601 --> 01:04:33.601
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to ask her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you that Joe Bryan was very </v>

1293
01:04:33.601 --> 01:04:33.660
<v Speaker 5>excited to come here because he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1294
01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:36.180
<v Speaker 5>this guy can't be right and he gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

1295
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:38.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very passionate about his ideas,</v>

1296
01:04:38.890 --> 01:04:41.730
<v Speaker 5>but he's befuddled right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got him befuddled.</v>

1297
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.830
<v Speaker 5>I am the funnel and the funnel because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're so,</v>

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:45.960
<v Speaker 5>you're so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1299
01:04:45.961 --> 01:04:50.961
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You give so much credit to mainstream </v>

1300
01:04:50.961 --> 01:04:50.961
<v Speaker 5>science.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get so much credit to medicines that</v>

1301
01:04:50.961 --> 01:04:51.950
<v Speaker 5>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1302
01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:53.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about viruses,</v>

1303
01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:58.400
<v Speaker 5>vaccines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about chemotherapy both </v>

1304
01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:58.400
<v Speaker 5>secretly hoping you'd be more obviously </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>

1305
01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.160
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

1306
01:05:01.161 --> 01:05:06.161
<v Speaker 5>you're very likable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could wear the uniform where the </v>

1307
01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.340
<v Speaker 5>together that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's even worse for your career.</v>

1308
01:05:13.341 --> 01:05:16.210
<v Speaker 5>Then the aids thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just made the nazi salute.</v>

1309
01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:19.340
<v Speaker 5>He actually it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He flipped off Peter Sellers.</v>

1310
01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:26.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm still going to stick to my guns and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I still do that and I'm still gonna say </v>

1311
01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.870
<v Speaker 5>that I believe that hiv causes aids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I believe?</v>

1312
01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:32.680
<v Speaker 5>I believe I'm too stupid to understand </v>
<v Speaker 5>this argument to unread too.</v>

1313
01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go with the vast majority.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe.</v>

1314
01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.180
<v Speaker 5>You know what I just thought of when he </v>
<v Speaker 5>first got here,</v>

1315
01:05:37.181 --> 01:05:38.770
<v Speaker 5>we were talking about castles in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Germany.</v>

1316
01:05:38.771 --> 01:05:41.350
<v Speaker 5>I want to go to Germany and see the </v>
<v Speaker 5>castles and stuff like that,</v>

1317
01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.240
<v Speaker 5>and then I just noticed that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1318
01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:47.170
<v Speaker 5>the nazis holding a white castle tee </v>
<v Speaker 5>shirt.</v>

1319
01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.640
<v Speaker 5>You just work that in because we weren't</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about castles in Germany.</v>

1320
01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:55.600
<v Speaker 5>I was talking to the doctor earlier or </v>
<v Speaker 5>try to work with it and planted it.</v>

1321
01:05:55.601 --> 01:05:57.850
<v Speaker 5>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you mentioned the white castle.</v>

1322
01:05:57.851 --> 01:05:59.940
<v Speaker 5>That's his new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck,</v>

1323
01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.190
<v Speaker 5>how dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever come to standup comedy?</v>

1324
01:06:03.191 --> 01:06:05.960
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever watch any standup?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dr.</v>

1325
01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.420
<v Speaker 5>Vickery vanity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I love it.</v>

1326
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:09.070
<v Speaker 5>There's not a lot of stand up to come </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of Germany.</v>

1327
01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:12.430
<v Speaker 5>They're fairly linear people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They make good cars though.</v>

1328
01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:14.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make the shit out of some cars.</v>

1329
01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:19.820
<v Speaker 5>It will invite you to a shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So some good headway in munich and in </v>

1330
01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:23.350
<v Speaker 5>paleo.</v>

1331
01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.300
<v Speaker 5>You bring that bitch to the comedy store</v>
<v Speaker 5>watching meat hooks.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>talks about how scary like a german guy </v>

1335
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:39.100
<v Speaker 5>threatens you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1336
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:39.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1340
01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:49.630
<v Speaker 5>They just show up and I have already.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would threaten you,</v>

1341
01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:51.330
<v Speaker 5>but I have already pushed into my </v>
<v Speaker 5>friend.</v>

1342
01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:53.560
<v Speaker 5>That guy's dies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1343
01:06:53.561 --> 01:06:56.290
<v Speaker 5>How did the germans get to be such a </v>
<v Speaker 5>calculating,</v>

1344
01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:01.820
<v Speaker 5>not wanting to say emotionless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but controlled people have done happen.</v>

1345
01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:04.780
<v Speaker 5>The most disciplined people in the world</v>
<v Speaker 5>here are.</v>

1346
01:07:04.781 --> 01:07:07.540
<v Speaker 5>They know all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you look at that,</v>

1347
01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:09.010
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1348
01:07:09.011 --> 01:07:14.011
<v Speaker 5>Lots of underneath it fucks up with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>more god that shit get away from the </v>

1349
01:07:14.011 --> 01:07:17.780
<v Speaker 5>theory goes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That theory goes that the germans were </v>

1350
01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:20.790
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very civilized people and a very </v>

1351
01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:21.730
<v Speaker 5>suppressive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're very oppressive,</v>

1352
01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:23.980
<v Speaker 5>oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and suppressed.</v>

1353
01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:27.550
<v Speaker 5>Manners,</v>
<v Speaker 5>protocol behavior.</v>

1354
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:31.450
<v Speaker 5>A delineation of authority is very </v>
<v Speaker 5>important and and all that.</v>

1355
01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:35.560
<v Speaker 5>Keeping all of your animal in check was </v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1356
01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.340
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When,</v>

1357
01:07:36.341 --> 01:07:38.260
<v Speaker 5>when chaos struck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just went.</v>

1358
01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:43.320
<v Speaker 5>They went crazy and light was so </v>
<v Speaker 5>possible to manipulate in that way.</v>

1359
01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.910
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's dangerous to control </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1360
01:07:45.911 --> 01:07:49.030
<v Speaker 5>United States government and stop trying</v>
<v Speaker 5>to control people.</v>

1361
01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:54.031
<v Speaker 5>You're creating nazi Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Germany was a great to the notion of a </v>

1362
01:07:54.031 --> 01:07:56.810
<v Speaker 5>totalitarian regime to totalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meaning control over it.</v>

1363
01:07:56.830 --> 01:07:58.840
<v Speaker 5>The total person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not only in their body,</v>

1364
01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:01.180
<v Speaker 5>but their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a.</v>

1365
01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:04.720
<v Speaker 5>That was a fascist nazi notion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't it?</v>

1366
01:08:04.721 --> 01:08:09.721
<v Speaker 5>That was an idea behind that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're the ones who invented </v>

1367
01:08:09.721 --> 01:08:10.720
<v Speaker 5>crystal meth way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Give that shit.</v>

1368
01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:15.740
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1369
01:08:15.741 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 5>they use</v>

1370
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.580
<v Speaker 1>it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how the kamikaze is.</v>

1371
01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:20.840
<v Speaker 1>They talked him into slamming the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking planes and boats and shit.</v>

1372
01:08:21.090 --> 01:08:23.660
<v Speaker 1>They were left out of their head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these japanese.</v>

1373
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1374
01:08:26.661 --> 01:08:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't disagree with you.</v>

1375
01:08:28.131 --> 01:08:31.220
<v Speaker 1>I've been wrong earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you're wrong now to excuse me,</v>

1376
01:08:31.221 --> 01:08:32.090
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been wrong.</v>

<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1378
01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:33.890

<v Speaker 1>amphetamines and steroids too.</v>

1383
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:45.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1387
01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.550
<v Speaker 5>Shows you how things have changed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the seventies,</v>

1388
01:09:02.730 --> 01:09:07.730
<v Speaker 4>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was fairly popular and the </v>

1389
01:09:07.730 --> 01:09:07.730
<v Speaker 4>students were much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much more open.</v>

1390
01:09:07.730 --> 01:09:12.290
<v Speaker 4>Students sit tight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tight disc.</v>

1391
01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.310
<v Speaker 4>That's the only cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Avocado.</v>

1392
01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:19.430
<v Speaker 5>The students.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever do acid?</v>

1393
01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.500
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever try out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about weed?</v>

1394
01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:27.730
<v Speaker 4>Who did that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried a couple of data and didn't do </v>

1395
01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:30.480
<v Speaker 4>much good for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a cocaine is like Texas.</v>

1396
01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:36.100
<v Speaker 5>A lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

1397
01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:39.030
<v Speaker 5>If it was lines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not dejected,</v>

1398
01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:44.210
<v Speaker 5>but the way you just said that to it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>lines not injected.</v>

1399
01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:49.390
<v Speaker 5>Like who the fuck is injecting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who?</v>

1400
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:52.530

<v Speaker 5>Have enough.</v>

1402
01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.700
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked a student to get me some food.</v>

1403
01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.980
<v Speaker 4>I think too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would call a campus project.</v>

1404
01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.050
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would go on a tight budget.</v>

1405
01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:08.800
<v Speaker 5>Why not even got to speak with samsung </v>
<v Speaker 5>now?</v>

1406
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:12.380
<v Speaker 5>Still teaching what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>

1407
01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:13.760
<v Speaker 5>Limited.</v>

1408
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:19.310
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Captured student came to me or did they </v>

1409
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:19.760
<v Speaker 4>told him this year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we'll wait for 15 years.</v>

1410
01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:21.560
<v Speaker 4>No cans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

1411
01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:25.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm surprised that I'm still at a great </v>
<v Speaker 4>price for your point of view,</v>

1412
01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:30.520
<v Speaker 4>mike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I really sacrificed a lot of </v>

1413
01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.731
<v Speaker 4>status.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was told you I was one of the blue </v>

1414
01:10:33.731 --> 01:10:35.920
<v Speaker 4>white boys in the days I was close to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nova for finding out the structure of </v>

1415
01:10:35.991 --> 01:10:38.210
<v Speaker 4>the retrovirus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the chines of retrovirus.</v>

1416
01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.850
<v Speaker 4>That was me pulling the switch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chines chines nucleic acid,</v>

1417
01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.830
<v Speaker 4>the size of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I realized that the potential.</v>

1418
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:47.120
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1419
01:10:47.121 --> 01:10:51.170
<v Speaker 4>so I was very popular in a fountain </v>
<v Speaker 4>uncle gene in one of them and so that.</v>

1420
01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:53.710
<v Speaker 4>Why didn't you keep your mouth shut </v>
<v Speaker 4>about?</v>

1421
01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:54.100
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He.</v>

1422
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:57.560
<v Speaker 4>That's jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy though.</v>

1423
01:10:57.561 --> 01:10:59.180
<v Speaker 4>I know it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just being.</v>

1424
01:10:59.190 --> 01:11:04.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm just follow orders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said somehow you have that feeling.</v>

1425
01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:09.890
<v Speaker 4>We have done it before following orders </v>
<v Speaker 4>or just do what's politically correct,</v>

1426
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:15.070
<v Speaker 4>but it was because you couldn't find the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hiv virus that we couldn't actually </v>

1427
01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:15.070
<v Speaker 4>isolated.</v>

1428
01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:16.230
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it was that caused you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>know?</v>

1429
01:11:16.231 --> 01:11:18.810
<v Speaker 4>It was very clear that under those </v>
<v Speaker 4>conditions,</v>

1430
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:23.820
<v Speaker 4>that virus neutralizing antibody doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it's supposed to do,</v>

1431
01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:26.610
<v Speaker 4>10 years after infection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>

1432
01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:31.820
<v Speaker 4>If I was turns to crank in 24 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you get infected by flu or herpes </v>

1433
01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:36.420
<v Speaker 4>syphilis or mums or anything at any </v>
<v Speaker 4>party,</v>

1434
01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:41.690
<v Speaker 4>well if nothing happens in a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every doctor will tell you you got away </v>

1435
01:11:41.690 --> 01:11:44.110
<v Speaker 4>even swiped through texts three to seven</v>
<v Speaker 4>days,</v>

1436
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:45.810
<v Speaker 4>but here you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1437
01:11:45.811 --> 01:11:48.810
<v Speaker 4>you had some wild party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ten yeArs later you have diarrhea.</v>

1438
01:11:48.811 --> 01:11:52.770
<v Speaker 4>It relates to fighting disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the idea.</v>

1439
01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:55.500
<v Speaker 4>The idea is a virus incubates for a long</v>
<v Speaker 4>period of time like syphilis,</v>

1440
01:11:55.501 --> 01:11:57.780
<v Speaker 4>syphilis does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It shows stone.</v>

1441
01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.620
<v Speaker 4>They have a very low iq,</v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely low,</v>

1442
01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:06.650
<v Speaker 4>but does manifest itself as a source and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it comes back to incubate and then </v>

1443
01:12:07.621 --> 01:12:10.470
<v Speaker 4>it attacks the brain and this white </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes pick why?</v>

1444
01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.960
<v Speaker 4>When they treated it with mercury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's iatrogenic doctor induced disease,</v>

1445
01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:21.650
<v Speaker 4>they give you mercury and the and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>standard of care was one km of mercury,</v>

1446
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:25.800
<v Speaker 4>the equivalent of act around the turn of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the century,</v>

1447
01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:29.710
<v Speaker 4>a day for a year to kill your syphilis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1448
01:12:29.730 --> 01:12:34.730
<v Speaker 4>by that time your align niche,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got lots of people were most sugars </v>

1449
01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:38.100
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

1450
01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:44.780
<v Speaker 4>the word german,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a german or if they were very close</v>

1451
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:53.330
<v Speaker 4>for a long time until the hurricane did </v>
<v Speaker 4>very well.</v>

1452
01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:56.730
<v Speaker 4>I think they were together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1453
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:58.680
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

1454
01:12:58.990 --> 01:13:00.840
<v Speaker 4>That's the tertIary syphilis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gone.</v>

1455
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:05.250
<v Speaker 4>You don't hear a word about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will say a penicillin to.</v>

1456
01:13:05.251 --> 01:13:07.980
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You all not penicillin.</v>

1457
01:13:07.981 --> 01:13:12.981
<v Speaker 4>Penicillin was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Syphilis was around for millions of </v>

1458
01:13:12.981 --> 01:13:16.670
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People didn't get tertiary syphilis </v>

1459
01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:18.771
<v Speaker 4>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No venereal disease can really kill you </v>

1460
01:13:18.771 --> 01:13:20.550
<v Speaker 4>or else we wouldn't be around the 70.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Created super pussy though.</v>

1461
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:22.590
<v Speaker 4>That's where things got out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No syphilis though.</v>

1462
01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:24.060
<v Speaker 4>History,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've read a lot of history.</v>

1463
01:13:24.061 --> 01:13:27.630
<v Speaker 4>So this was a big player in was </v>
<v Speaker 4>tuberculosis.</v>

1464
01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.400
<v Speaker 4>You weren't dying from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1465
01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:31.570
<v Speaker 4>already did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1466
01:13:31.650 --> 01:13:35.940
<v Speaker 4>maybe when the doctor came in between </v>
<v Speaker 4>mercury and arsenic,</v>

1467
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.020
<v Speaker 4>then sooner or later you are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never wear a condom.</v>

1468
01:13:40.021 --> 01:13:45.021
<v Speaker 4>So what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were sick and they went to the </v>

1469
01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:45.021
<v Speaker 4>doctor and the doctor gave him something</v>
<v Speaker 4>to killed them,</v>

1470
01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:49.110
<v Speaker 4>but because they were probably recovered</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you're saying,</v>

1471
01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:54.140
<v Speaker 4>you'll of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so syphilis is something that you </v>

1472
01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:54.140
<v Speaker 4>recovered from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

1473
01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:54.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean syphilis is millions of years </v>
<v Speaker 4>old.</v>

1474
01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.840
<v Speaker 4>Millions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a step sold.</v>

1475
01:13:57.870 --> 01:14:01.110
<v Speaker 4>It hurts a couple of weeks and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>your annual rejected,</v>

1476
01:14:01.111 --> 01:14:02.630
<v Speaker 4>your immune system rejecting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about.</v>

1477
01:14:03.450 --> 01:14:04.980
<v Speaker 4>What about chlamydia and gonorrhea?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same thing.</v>

1478
01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:07.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know so well about chlamydia.</v>

1479
01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:11.510
<v Speaker 4>Chlamydia for women can actually be </v>
<v Speaker 4>sterilizing or.</v>

1480
01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:11.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1481
01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:14.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's not killing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1482
01:14:14.381 --> 01:14:19.381
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times your body fights off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sooner or later you find them all so </v>

1483
01:14:19.381 --> 01:14:20.680
<v Speaker 1>dirty trick that you get diseases from </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex.</v>

1484
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:24.000
<v Speaker 1>That is the dirtiest when my kolbe </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes,</v>

1485
01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:29.010
<v Speaker 1>everything they get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have not been all that </v>

1486
01:14:29.010 --> 01:14:29.010
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We exploding.</v>

1487
01:14:29.010 --> 01:14:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1488
01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:30.100
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1489
01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:32.010
<v Speaker 1>We keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think loud.</v>

1490
01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:34.210
<v Speaker 1>The civil case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dirty trick.</v>

1491
01:14:34.211 --> 01:14:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Nature plays on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will sit and wait in there.</v>

1492
01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Actually joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese created math by the way.</v>

1493
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:41.060
<v Speaker 1>Kamikaze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1494
01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:42.640
<v Speaker 1>you're right about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

1495
01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Kamikaze used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still don't believe it there.</v>

1496
01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:44.900
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1497
01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:45.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1498
01:14:45.911 --> 01:14:46.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1499
01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:48.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the germans in creative japanese created</v>

1500
01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.290
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the talked the kamikazes into it,</v>

1501
01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:51.410
<v Speaker 1>but the germans used it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1502
01:14:52.450 --> 01:14:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were all working together.</v>

1503
01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:56.550
<v Speaker 1>The japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1504
01:14:57.330 --> 01:15:02.330
<v Speaker 1>in those days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole fucking kamikaze king is one </v>

1505
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:04.270
<v Speaker 1>of the nuttiest things that warfare has </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen.</v>

1506
01:15:04.271 --> 01:15:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Just dudes flying planes mapped out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their mind into boats.</v>

1507
01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1508
01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:17.280
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for people to listen to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not think that it's almost </v>

1509
01:15:18.131 --> 01:15:23.131
<v Speaker 1>impossible to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There could be some sort of a gigantic </v>

1510
01:15:23.131 --> 01:15:23.170
<v Speaker 1>scandal on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1511
01:15:23.171 --> 01:15:26.950
<v Speaker 1>this larger level and it's all just </v>
<v Speaker 1>about pocketing money.</v>

1512
01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:32.120
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by how many of the people that are </v>

1513
01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.511
<v Speaker 1>involved in it do you think are actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware that there's no real connection </v>

1514
01:15:33.511 --> 01:15:34.960
<v Speaker 1>between hiv and aids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a percentage of the people?</v>

1515
01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Dave wouldn't see this radically see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1516
01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:42.550
<v Speaker 2>you call up with this as a scientist </v>
<v Speaker 2>with biosil biologist you,</v>

1517
01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:45.180
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to deny your own field is </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1518
01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:49.900
<v Speaker 2>it's like the old man's still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy to,</v>

1519
01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:54.410
<v Speaker 2>to burn it out and to change it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very few scientists are,</v>

1520
01:15:55.290 --> 01:15:58.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the record to question their own work</v>

1521
01:15:59.090 --> 01:16:01.010
<v Speaker 2>and particularly when it's such a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>investment.</v>

1522
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:05.610
<v Speaker 2>They did the a d eight squeeze searches </v>
<v Speaker 2>still favored anyway.</v>

1523
01:16:05.611 --> 01:16:08.930
<v Speaker 2>They get all the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to get the investment papers.</v>

1524
01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:10.880
<v Speaker 2>They have companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never had it so good.</v>

1525
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Never they would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as long as they can.</v>

1526
01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:16.730
<v Speaker 2>When you asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1527
01:16:16.731 --> 01:16:17.990
<v Speaker 2>I used to ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always say,</v>

1528
01:16:17.991 --> 01:16:22.991
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an expert on what gay lifestyle </v>

1529
01:16:22.991 --> 01:16:22.991
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an expert on epidemiology.</v>

1530
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:28.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why this was so slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My field is just look at the potain or </v>

1531
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:31.100
<v Speaker 2>look at this talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but very compartmentalized.</v>

1532
01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:34.820
<v Speaker 2>I noticed that that's an excuse of day </v>
<v Speaker 2>to day.</v>

1533
01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:37.160
<v Speaker 2>Could easily do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't want to.</v>

1534
01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:39.260
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to look at the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

1535
01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:40.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my niche,</v>

1536
01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:42.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm accepted.</v>

1537
01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:43.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing.</v>

1538
01:16:43.450 --> 01:16:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Are there social consequences to </v>
<v Speaker 1>questioning as a lifestyle shoe?</v>

1539
01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:48.820
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe it.</v>

1540
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:50.560
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of my friends,</v>

1541
01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:54.710
<v Speaker 2>Chile is one of them in san francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Auto co-discovered,</v>

1542
01:16:54.850 --> 01:16:57.670
<v Speaker 2>gallo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>montane a tiny bit talks to me,</v>

1543
01:16:57.671 --> 01:17:00.580
<v Speaker 2>but they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not invited to meetings anymore.</v>

1544
01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:04.690
<v Speaker 2>I have not gotten any nih.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not one in 20 years.</v>

1545
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:07.720
<v Speaker 2>That's usually the test of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimental scientist.</v>

1546
01:17:08.230 --> 01:17:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I got every con I wanted for 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came in 64 for 20 years.</v>

1547
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:16.840
<v Speaker 2>I had every cut I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the best deal,</v>

1548
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:21.910
<v Speaker 2>the head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's called an outstanding science </v>

1549
01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.540
<v Speaker 2>scientists reward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was seven years unquestioned.</v>

1550
01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:28.280
<v Speaker 2>What I did was I used it for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1551
01:17:28.281 --> 01:17:32.630
<v Speaker 2>since I'm supposed to do a whiskey work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1552
01:17:32.631 --> 01:17:34.300
<v Speaker 2>look at this was hiv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something,</v>

1553
01:17:34.301 --> 01:17:35.480
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we won't get anywhere,</v>

1554
01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:41.260
<v Speaker 2>and I thought they would hug me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have done if you only use it for </v>

1555
01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:43.100
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it the opposite was the case.</v>

1556
01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Then I couldn't make me this paper here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a rebirth of one that was </v>

1557
01:17:49.161 --> 01:17:54.161
<v Speaker 2>published before two years before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aids to me is it's so politically and </v>

1558
01:17:54.531 --> 01:17:58.190
<v Speaker 2>socially charged as opposed to any other</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease because of the fact that it's so</v>

1559
01:17:58.191 --> 01:18:01.430
<v Speaker 2>predominantly affects the gay community </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets part of it,</v>

1560
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:04.820
<v Speaker 2>but not all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all from the scientists.</v>

1561
01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:10.520
<v Speaker 2>They weren't they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were on the wrong track with </v>

1562
01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.900
<v Speaker 2>viruses and I was one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We tried cancer.</v>

1563
01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:16.960
<v Speaker 2>That would have been the big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he had found boluses as costs of </v>

1564
01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:17.720
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't vaccinate in the deep cancer</v>

1565
01:18:17.721 --> 01:18:21.260
<v Speaker 2>would have been possibly under control </v>
<v Speaker 2>or even eliminated.</v>

1566
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:22.690
<v Speaker 2>That failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1567
01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:27.700
<v Speaker 2>he all these luminaries a bishop and </v>
<v Speaker 2>varmus and baltimore donnelly take few </v>

1568
01:18:28.611 --> 01:18:33.611
<v Speaker 2>blocks down here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had all nobel prizes for that </v>

1569
01:18:33.611 --> 01:18:36.040
<v Speaker 2>already or temin with all my dissipated </v>
<v Speaker 2>in science and they had no,</v>

1570
01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:36.710
<v Speaker 2>we would.</v>

1571
01:18:36.730 --> 01:18:37.610
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1572
01:18:37.611 --> 01:18:40.880
<v Speaker 2>my bios is not so important as I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it to be.</v>

1573
01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:46.180
<v Speaker 2>I finally had some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get clinical relevance with </v>

1574
01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:50.290
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now with eight I finally am </v>

1575
01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:50.290
<v Speaker 2>clinically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have vowels.</v>

1576
01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:52.550
<v Speaker 2>That's really bad and In reality that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they like.</v>

1577
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:56.090
<v Speaker 2>They know the important and now he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>these 10,000</v>

1578
01:18:56.091 --> 01:18:59.780
<v Speaker 2>plus each aids researchers in these labs</v>
<v Speaker 2>working for 20,</v>

1579
01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.270
<v Speaker 2>25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will it have you ever heard?</v>

1580
01:19:02.970 --> 01:19:05.690
<v Speaker 2>Which is most definitely bio's see New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York times.</v>

1581
01:19:05.691 --> 01:19:08.830
<v Speaker 2>It also the deadly wells each.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>

1582
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:14.240
<v Speaker 2>let me put one more point and basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're working with it for 20 years.</v>

1583
01:19:14.241 --> 01:19:16.220
<v Speaker 2>They have no vaccine because they could </v>
<v Speaker 2>make one.</v>

1584
01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about that early and not one </v>

1585
01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.330
<v Speaker 2>of ever came down with aids from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state levels.</v>

1586
01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Neither of them will take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1587
01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:30.350
<v Speaker 2>maybe none of they have earned my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put mass.</v>

1588
01:19:30.351 --> 01:19:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Produce It for biochemical studies to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make vaccine,</v>

1589
01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:38.980
<v Speaker 2>you'll have to mass produce virus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you take the proteins out and </v>

1590
01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:41.420
<v Speaker 2>vaccinate and for the test do you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make antibody against seat?</v>

1591
01:19:41.421 --> 01:19:43.610
<v Speaker 2>You need tons of files.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not one,</v>

1592
01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.240
<v Speaker 2>not a technician or the collaborator of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these 10,000</v>

1593
01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:51.680
<v Speaker 2>researchers that daily work with it have</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten violence from.</v>

1594
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:53.610
<v Speaker 2>From the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the one they call.</v>

1595
01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:55.370
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that odd?</v>

1596
01:19:55.950 --> 01:20:00.950
<v Speaker 1>It's odd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that could just be attributed to </v>

1597
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:03.450
<v Speaker 1>being very careful with a deadly virus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Onesie outfits.</v>

1598
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:07.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean extremely careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have about thousand doctors,</v>

1599
01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:08.360
<v Speaker 1>doctors</v>

1600
01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:11.340
<v Speaker 3>per year getting hepatitis infections </v>
<v Speaker 3>from patients.</v>

1601
01:20:11.370 --> 01:20:16.370
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they're bringing their </v>
<v Speaker 3>patients know that you're leaving out </v>

1602
01:20:16.510 --> 01:20:21.510
<v Speaker 3>something that's important though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're leaving out something if they </v>

1603
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.600
<v Speaker 3>don't get it from working in tons of </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>

1604
01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:23.610
<v Speaker 3>Remember that's very important that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1605
01:20:24.230 --> 01:20:25.030
<v Speaker 3>that is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>

1606
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:26.210
<v Speaker 3>That's very interesting actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

1607
01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:26.700
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let me,</v>

1608
01:20:26.701 --> 01:20:31.701
<v Speaker 3>let me just say one thing that I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're leaving out a great deal of the </v>

1609
01:20:31.701 --> 01:20:35.001
<v Speaker 3>momentum for aids research and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason so much money is devoted to age </v>

1610
01:20:35.931 --> 01:20:40.290
<v Speaker 3>research was because there was such an </v>
<v Speaker 3>epidemic in the eighties,</v>

1611
01:20:40.291 --> 01:20:43.080
<v Speaker 3>nineties with gay men who were dying and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were.</v>

1612
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:44.770
<v Speaker 3>They literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it,</v>

1613
01:20:44.771 --> 01:20:47.080
<v Speaker 3>it brought gay people out of the closet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

1614
01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:50.940
<v Speaker 3>it organized gay gay people to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1615
01:20:50.941 --> 01:20:54.240
<v Speaker 3>we're dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody cares about us unless we get into</v>

1616
01:20:54.241 --> 01:20:59.241
<v Speaker 3>the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless we really created a strong lobby </v>

1617
01:20:59.241 --> 01:21:01.920
<v Speaker 3>for research for this disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to be here anymore.</v>

1618
01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.100
<v Speaker 3>And if you talk to a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Collins,</v>

1619
01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:06.690
<v Speaker 3>one of the people who spearheaded this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>

1620
01:21:06.691 --> 01:21:09.330
<v Speaker 3>we have nothing to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're dying.</v>

1621
01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:10.080
<v Speaker 3>We're dying.</v>

1622
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:12.070
<v Speaker 1>He's actually addressed this already </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1623
01:21:12.071 --> 01:21:14.590
<v Speaker 1>He said that this is because of illicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug use.</v>

1624
01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:17.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's bringing something that people were</v>

1625
01:21:17.711 --> 01:21:20.320
<v Speaker 1>not doing drugs or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a fact,</v>

1626
01:21:20.650 --> 01:21:25.650
<v Speaker 1>the massive amount of drugs that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>being used and he's correlating it to </v>

1627
01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:27.070
<v Speaker 1>the group of people that were using them</v>
<v Speaker 1>who got sick.</v>

1628
01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:29.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying a lot of people say that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>

1629
01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he's saying.</v>

1630
01:21:31.031 --> 01:21:32.260
<v Speaker 1>And they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we have a.</v>

1631
01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.600
<v Speaker 1>We have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who's right?</v>

1632
01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:36.790
<v Speaker 3>Not everybody in the streets in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties,</v>

1633
01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:41.800
<v Speaker 3>nineties who were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who were fighting and organizing and </v>

1634
01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:42.160
<v Speaker 3>putting all their time into this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're doing drugs.</v>

1635
01:21:42.161 --> 01:21:42.400
<v Speaker 3>Who are here?</v>

1636
01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:43.780
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1637
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:46.590
<v Speaker 1>But he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's saying even today,</v>

1638
01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:50.190
<v Speaker 1>that the people that are testing </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive for drugs,</v>

1639
01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:54.300
<v Speaker 1>they are junkies and drug testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive for hiv.</v>

1640
01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Are junkies and drug users primarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal in America?</v>

1641
01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:00.240
<v Speaker 1>What'd you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you say?</v>

1642
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Children are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're a child,</v>

1643
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:05.700
<v Speaker 1>unless you're a child from his mother to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a black children can get a feel.</v>

1644
01:22:05.730 --> 01:22:07.560
<v Speaker 1>He actually got into a blood sugar </v>
<v Speaker 1>transact.</v>

1645
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:09.810
<v Speaker 1>What about hemophilia to get it through </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood transfusions,</v>

1646
01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:16.120
<v Speaker 1>hemophilia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are the eight cases among </v>

1647
01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:16.800
<v Speaker 1>hemophilia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1648
01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:21.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying is that ever happened </v>

1649
01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:24.350
<v Speaker 1>where the head read ahead of fuel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly it went up tenfold after </v>

1650
01:22:25.081 --> 01:22:29.610
<v Speaker 1>they gave him act and they got eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that makes sense.</v>

1651
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:35.270
<v Speaker 1>The lifespan was increasing until 87 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he talked.</v>

1652
01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:41.070
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying that in showing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had the rush,</v>

1653
01:22:41.130 --> 01:22:46.130
<v Speaker 1>the antibody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the body was successfully fighting </v>

1654
01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:48.600
<v Speaker 1>off of it though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even though they show this antibody,</v>

1655
01:22:48.810 --> 01:22:52.560
<v Speaker 1>that was an excuse to introduce act into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system to combat this thing.</v>

1656
01:22:52.561 --> 01:22:55.640
<v Speaker 1>It was creating this antibody body die </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the body dies,</v>

1657
01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.900
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people were getting a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of hemophiliacs.</v>

1658
01:22:57.901 --> 01:23:02.901
<v Speaker 1>People were getting weird diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why they got tested in the </v>

1659
01:23:02.901 --> 01:23:06.201
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like people were getting </v>

1660
01:23:06.201 --> 01:23:06.201
<v Speaker 1>tested because of blood</v>

1661
01:23:06.201 --> 01:23:07.690
<v Speaker 3>transfusions all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1662
01:23:07.691 --> 01:23:12.691
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are a lot of people that were </v>

1663
01:23:12.691 --> 01:23:12.691
<v Speaker 3>that I knew that all of a sudden we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting.</v>

1664
01:23:12.691 --> 01:23:12.910
<v Speaker 3>My buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got a.</v>

1665
01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:17.080
<v Speaker 3>He got a huge blue thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was rollerblading and he was this big</v>

1666
01:23:17.081 --> 01:23:20.230
<v Speaker 3>strapping guy who didn't do drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just had gay sex.</v>

1667
01:23:20.231 --> 01:23:23.170
<v Speaker 3>He did not do drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a personal trainer and he,</v>

1668
01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:28.440
<v Speaker 3>my buddy will stand there and he had a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got a huge blue thing and all of a </v>

1669
01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:29.370
<v Speaker 3>sudden I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's okay.</v>

1670
01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:33.040
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about guys that don't do drugs</v>

1671
01:23:33.170 --> 01:23:35.600
<v Speaker 1>and got aids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would happen with his.</v>

1672
01:23:35.601 --> 01:23:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Like his story.</v>

1673
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:38.430
<v Speaker 2>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

1674
01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:40.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's telling you about one.</v>

1675
01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:42.680
<v Speaker 1>What I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My buddy died.</v>

1676
01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Get maybe some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There may be something to get on </v>

1677
01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:47.760
<v Speaker 1>medication than die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1678
01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:47.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1679
01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.300
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could guide before medication and he</v>

1680
01:23:49.301 --> 01:23:52.400
<v Speaker 1>died slowly and he died without any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no azt.</v>

1681
01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:55.030
<v Speaker 1>No nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fridays he didn't work.</v>

1682
01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Then the second he tries to act and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>he died.</v>

1683
01:24:00.050 --> 01:24:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Still sort of like makes his case will </v>
<v Speaker 1>act is known to kill people.</v>

1684
01:24:04.811 --> 01:24:09.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean they stopped using it for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason to act is a terrible drug damage </v>

1685
01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:11.200
<v Speaker 1>alive today if he had protease </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibitors because.</v>

1686
01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of the people that I saw </v>

1687
01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:16.360
<v Speaker 1>who were dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who stuck it out and not take act.</v>

1688
01:24:16.361 --> 01:24:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're right.</v>

1689
01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Aids was killing people who didn't look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen man.</v>

1690
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:27.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched too many people die with my </v>

1691
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.570
<v Speaker 3>own eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell me you keep saying that,</v>

1692
01:24:27.571 --> 01:24:30.960
<v Speaker 3>but let me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That act is what caused people to die.</v>

1693
01:24:30.990 --> 01:24:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Saying that what I'm saying,</v>

1694
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:33.480
<v Speaker 1>what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you.</v>

1695
01:24:33.481 --> 01:24:38.481
<v Speaker 1>Are you completely confident in saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you understand that person's </v>

1696
01:24:38.481 --> 01:24:42.471
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle 100 percent and you know they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't doing something that you </v>

1697
01:24:42.471 --> 01:24:43.610
<v Speaker 1>might've known about completely about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1698
01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:44.630
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>

1699
01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:50.530
<v Speaker 3>Most people will tell you who lived </v>
<v Speaker 3>through this in and doctors who are </v>

1700
01:24:50.530 --> 01:24:54.341
<v Speaker 3>involved in this will say what got these</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys sick was obviously something they </v>

1701
01:24:54.501 --> 01:24:59.330
<v Speaker 3>caught through either gay sex through </v>
<v Speaker 3>intravenous drug use and by the way they</v>

1702
01:24:59.331 --> 01:25:03.830
<v Speaker 3>died in a very similar way of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>like wasting disease and pneumonia,</v>

1703
01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:06.440
<v Speaker 3>karposi sarcoma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible sores,</v>

1704
01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:09.200
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were dying that way.</v>

1705
01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see the issue in that like when </v>

1706
01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:17.540
<v Speaker 1>if someone goes and they find you when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sick and then they start treating</v>

1707
01:25:17.541 --> 01:25:19.160
<v Speaker 1>you when you're sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the.</v>

1708
01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:24.180
<v Speaker 1>The issue with that is how many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are hiv positive or tests for the </v>

1709
01:25:24.381 --> 01:25:28.610
<v Speaker 1>antibody but have nothing wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and then do no drugs.</v>

1710
01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Take no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no medication and live healthy lives and</v>

1711
01:25:32.871 --> 01:25:36.500
<v Speaker 1>then eventually get tested again and </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't show the antibody.</v>

1712
01:25:36.501 --> 01:25:37.850
<v Speaker 1>They don't show their body's fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

1713
01:25:37.930 --> 01:25:39.440
<v Speaker 1>How.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often does that happen?</v>

1714
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:41.730
<v Speaker 2>It does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were a couple,</v>

1715
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:46.910
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were 50 cases per year in us long </v>

1716
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:50.031
<v Speaker 2>before hiv came and it went up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of in the act days and so in </v>

1717
01:25:51.871 --> 01:25:54.050
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the case when the poppers,</v>

1718
01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:59.420
<v Speaker 1>poppers meaning email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nitrates or nitrites and nitrates and </v>

1719
01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.160
<v Speaker 1>that apparently is unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>devastating to the immune system.</v>

1720
01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:02.940
<v Speaker 1>It's media genic</v>

1721
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:05.300
<v Speaker 2>jenny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1722
01:26:06.190 --> 01:26:07.210
<v Speaker 3>and I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I.</v>

1723
01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:08.440
<v Speaker 3>Can I just be clear on what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying?</v>

1724
01:26:08.441 --> 01:26:12.220
<v Speaker 3>Actually you might also be saying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get the hiv virus,</v>

1725
01:26:12.221 --> 01:26:15.340
<v Speaker 3>which you can catch now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have it in your system.</v>

1726
01:26:15.341 --> 01:26:20.341
<v Speaker 3>If you're also doing things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>weakening your immune system like </v>

1727
01:26:20.341 --> 01:26:23.881
<v Speaker 3>poppers and things that's going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going to compromise your immune </v>

1728
01:26:23.881 --> 01:26:28.771
<v Speaker 3>system to the point where you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get all these were where I suppose </v>

1729
01:26:28.771 --> 01:26:32.470
<v Speaker 3>the hiv virus is going to create a </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation where you're going to.</v>

1730
01:26:32.471 --> 01:26:35.860
<v Speaker 3>It will further erode your immune system</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'll get these other diseases that</v>

1731
01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:36.150
<v Speaker 3>you might</v>

1732
01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:37.140
<v Speaker 2>daddy's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1733
01:26:37.170 --> 01:26:42.170
<v Speaker 2>something that would be verY testable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but see the cdc a not a straight or not </v>

1734
01:26:42.650 --> 01:26:47.650
<v Speaker 2>own little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never report pneumonias or kaposi </v>

1735
01:26:49.051 --> 01:26:53.210
<v Speaker 2>sarcoma of hiv feep people as pneumonia </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychosis.</v>

1736
01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:58.480
<v Speaker 2>They can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have an eight statistic when you're </v>

1737
01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:01.370
<v Speaker 2>hiv positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they report these diseases in the </v>

1738
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:03.870
<v Speaker 2>tdc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in engagement or in junkies that are not</v>

1739
01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:06.720
<v Speaker 2>antibody positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not even in the same journal.</v>

1740
01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:11.100
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people never hear about it gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>lumped into the aids deaths.</v>

1741
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:13.230
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a political decision.</v>

1742
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it take hold diseases and politically.</v>

1743
01:27:16.261 --> 01:27:19.530
<v Speaker 2>how can you have a common cause for </v>
<v Speaker 2>dementia?</v>

1744
01:27:19.650 --> 01:27:21.120
<v Speaker 2>Weight loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fever,</v>

1745
01:27:21.210 --> 01:27:23.010
<v Speaker 2>pneumonia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kaposi sarcoma,</v>

1746
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:24.570
<v Speaker 2>dIarrhea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leukemia,</v>

1747
01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:26.910
<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasting disease.</v>

1748
01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:32.210
<v Speaker 2>It's 27 altogether from one cost for </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything in the first place.</v>

1749
01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:34.560
<v Speaker 2>Lumping them all altogether is nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>but a money grab.</v>

1750
01:27:34.650 --> 01:27:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Did it's a mistake?</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1751
01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:41.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much more ego tHan money In </v>

1752
01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:41.480
<v Speaker 2>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1753
01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to be famous and they want</v>

1754
01:27:42.331 --> 01:27:44.400
<v Speaker 2>to be in the history books and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>textbooks.</v>

1755
01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:49.440
<v Speaker 2>They discoVered something.</v>

<v Speaker 2>prize,</v>

1757
01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:53.510
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people died of aids.</v>

1758
01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:58.540
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Act only came about after people were </v>

1759
01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:02.921
<v Speaker 1>dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people that were dying were </v>

1760
01:28:02.921 --> 01:28:04.790
<v Speaker 1>doing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's saying and I don't know</v>

1761
01:28:04.791 --> 01:28:06.680
<v Speaker 1>if you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I knew.</v>

1762
01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:11.681

<v Speaker 1>That's what we had always heard.</v>

1766
01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:22.930
<v Speaker 1>That was the story behind aids was never</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drug use until I read spin magazines</v>

1767
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:25.490
<v Speaker 1>article in [inaudible] 93.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had never even heard it brought up.</v>

1768
01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:28.010
<v Speaker 1>When I read that article about when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about,</v>

1769
01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:28.880
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

1770
01:28:28.890 --> 01:28:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Because I had just taken my first hiv </v>
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>

1771
01:28:31.671 --> 01:28:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I already got a health insurance and I'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>take my first hiv test and I was fucking</v>

1772
01:28:35.961 --> 01:28:38.210
<v Speaker 1>shitting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a lot of our.</v>

1773
01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:40.340
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified.</v>

1774
01:28:40.341 --> 01:28:42.620
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was going to die of aids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1775
01:28:42.621 --> 01:28:44.750
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dare you sir.</v>

1776
01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:46.190
<v Speaker 1>That's why I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave porn stars.</v>

1777
01:28:46.191 --> 01:28:47.740
<v Speaker 1>It's never done any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1778
01:28:47.890 --> 01:28:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I've never done any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah you do.</v>

1779
01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:51.280
<v Speaker 1>But they do talk about hiring high risk,</v>

1780
01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:56.280
<v Speaker 3>low risk behavior and you can get the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get the hiv virus from Ohio.</v>

1781
01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:58.720
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quote unquote high risk behavior,</v>

1782
01:28:58.721 --> 01:29:00.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Versus low risk behavior.</v>

1783
01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 3>How do</v>

1784
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.740
<v Speaker 2>you catch the aids virus?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult,</v>

1785
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:08.270
<v Speaker 3>but how would you catch it saying it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't exist.</v>

1786
01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.190
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aids virus.</v>

1787
01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:12.520
<v Speaker 3>So how do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you catch something?</v>

1788
01:29:12.610 --> 01:29:17.610
<v Speaker 3>He kept saying you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't believe there is something </v>

1789
01:29:17.610 --> 01:29:17.720
<v Speaker 3>called the hiv virus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said the aids virus does exist?</v>

1790
01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:21.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not the aids virus virus.</v>

1791
01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:22.800
<v Speaker 3>There's no what you just said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1792
01:29:22.810 --> 01:29:25.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hiv causes your immune system.</v>

1793
01:29:25.461 --> 01:29:28.490
<v Speaker 3>You did not hear him say you said aids </v>
<v Speaker 3>virus.</v>

1794
01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:30.800
<v Speaker 3>What I meant is hiv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

1795
01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:33.080
<v Speaker 3>which can be construed as the aids virus</v>
<v Speaker 3>because hey,</v>

1796
01:29:33.081 --> 01:29:36.770
<v Speaker 3>it's just me and acquired immune </v>
<v Speaker 3>deficiency syndrome.</v>

1797
01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:40.430
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you can be hiv positive,</v>

1798
01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:42.140
<v Speaker 3>you don't have full blown aids until </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1799
01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:44.530
<v Speaker 3>you've got all kinds of stuff going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>with obviously,</v>

1800
01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:46.340
<v Speaker 3>but so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>

1801
01:29:46.341 --> 01:29:49.250
<v Speaker 3>the hiv virus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do,</v>

1802
01:29:49.530 --> 01:29:52.280
<v Speaker 3>since we can test for the antibodies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>

1803
01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:57.460
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people who test for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>antibodies are what we were talking </v>

1804
01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:57.860
<v Speaker 3>about intravenous drug users,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay men,</v>

1805
01:29:58.370 --> 01:30:03.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then of course in africa to </v>

1806
01:30:03.370 --> 01:30:03.370
<v Speaker 3>heterosexual disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1807
01:30:03.370 --> 01:30:03.620
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does that happen?</v>

1808
01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:06.990
<v Speaker 3>How did they get that virus in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't most straight?</v>

1809
01:30:07.050 --> 01:30:12.050
<v Speaker 2>There's little known about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean the best way to transmitted </v>

1810
01:30:12.050 --> 01:30:14.220
<v Speaker 2>is actually transfusions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult.</v>

1811
01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:17.490
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes on average from the literature.</v>

1812
01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:22.820
<v Speaker 2>Hemophiliacs for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coupled within without on the average </v>

1813
01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:26.960
<v Speaker 2>thousand unprotected contacts to convert</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive to a negative thousand.</v>

1814
01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That cannot be a normal way of</v>

1815
01:30:31.150 --> 01:30:36.150
<v Speaker 3>keisha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to say this is a very eyeopening </v>

1816
01:30:36.150 --> 01:30:36.150
<v Speaker 3>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1817
01:30:36.150 --> 01:30:36.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to say that you,</v>

1818
01:30:36.150 --> 01:30:41.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing for 25 years as we have and </v>

1819
01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:41.160
<v Speaker 3>then you come along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1820
01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:44.220
<v Speaker 3>you're raising questions that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are very,</v>

1821
01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:46.680
<v Speaker 3>that are very interested too stupid to </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer those questions.</v>

1822
01:30:46.681 --> 01:30:48.380
<v Speaker 3>So this is the problem we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to.</v>

1823
01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:48.970
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1824
01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:55.240
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say just uninformed to </v>

1825
01:30:55.861 --> 01:30:58.680
<v Speaker 3>recognize that the fact that this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>such a touchy subject,</v>

1826
01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:01.170
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to try to find some </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists willing to do this,</v>

1827
01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:06.320
<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile we have to make sure we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get trolled and some crazy desk </v>

1828
01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.540
<v Speaker 1>squad fan his way in as a fake scientist</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1829
01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to probably reach </v>

1830
01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:15.980
<v Speaker 1>people up and you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1831
01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:17.100
<v Speaker 1>we're probably going to have to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reach out and contact someone and figure</v>

1832
01:31:17.101 --> 01:31:18.270
<v Speaker 1>out what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell.</v>

1833
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:22.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about dr drew?</v>

1834
01:31:22.130 --> 01:31:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I tried dr.</v>

1835
01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Drew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1836
01:31:23.791 --> 01:31:25.950
<v Speaker 1>I brought this up to dr drew about eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

1837
01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:31.220
<v Speaker 1>I've been following your work for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and I brought it up to dr drew a </v>

1838
01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:31.580
<v Speaker 1>long time ago and like the last time I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was on loveline,</v>

1839
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:36.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how long ago that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he dismissed it immediately without </v>

1840
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:38.310
<v Speaker 1>even considering it and then looked at </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1841
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:43.550
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your website for about five minutes and </v>

1842
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.550
<v Speaker 1>said something was wrong there.</v>

1843
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.950
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1844
01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:49.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I suspect he might be full of shit </v>

1845
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.030
<v Speaker 1>becaUSe he's full of shit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

1846
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:51.570
<v Speaker 1>He's always talking about marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>being unbelievably addictive,</v>

1847
01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:54.270
<v Speaker 1>addictive syndromes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We find it to connect to the marijuana.</v>

1848
01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:59.510
<v Speaker 1>That's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that show anY addiction to </v>

1849
01:31:59.510 --> 01:32:02.601
<v Speaker 1>marijuana either they're unusual cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely unusual or it's a </v>

1850
01:32:02.601 --> 01:32:05.140
<v Speaker 1>psychological addiction much like </v>
<v Speaker 1>gambling or masturbating or anything.</v>

1851
01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:08.500
<v Speaker 1>So for him to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a doctor to spout that,</v>

1852
01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:11.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most doctors study,</v>

1853
01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.510
<v Speaker 1>they're very orthodox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The medical staff,</v>

1854
01:32:13.511 --> 01:32:14.620
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like dr drew.</v>

1855
01:32:14.650 --> 01:32:16.180
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>

1856
01:32:16.181 --> 01:32:17.430
<v Speaker 1>I just think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1857
01:32:17.650 --> 01:32:20.290
<v Speaker 1>people get an idea in their head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they rock with it.</v>

1858
01:32:20.291 --> 01:32:22.510
<v Speaker 1>And his idea is that sobriety is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only way to go,</v>

1859
01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:23.230
<v Speaker 1>but as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

1860
01:32:23.231 --> 01:32:28.231
<v Speaker 1>as a doctor and as a surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start talking about nutrition </v>

1861
01:32:28.231 --> 01:32:28.231
<v Speaker 1>to your colleagues and they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck they're talking about,</v>

1862
01:32:28.231 --> 01:32:28.780
<v Speaker 1>it's taboo.</v>

1863
01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:31.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a orthodoxy is of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

1864
01:32:31.211 --> 01:32:33.400
<v Speaker 1>is forced on you in the medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment.</v>

1865
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

1866
01:32:34.421 --> 01:32:39.421
<v Speaker 1>the amount of nutrition information that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're given during medical school is </v>

1867
01:32:39.421 --> 01:32:39.830
<v Speaker 1>so minimal and constantly changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1868
01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:45.160
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's constant studies that are going </v>

1869
01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:45.160
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>

1870
01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:48.270
<v Speaker 1>you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people have a certain amount of </v>

1871
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:51.640
<v Speaker 1>knowledge in their field and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep up and the time goes by 10,</v>

1872
01:32:51.650 --> 01:32:56.650
<v Speaker 1>20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you might as well be the average </v>

1873
01:32:56.650 --> 01:32:56.650
<v Speaker 1>person on the street like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1874
01:32:56.650 --> 01:33:01.141
<v Speaker 1>shit from 20 years ago things have </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed radically the way it is.</v>

1875
01:33:01.901 --> 01:33:06.901
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the ufc in [inaudible] 93</v>
<v Speaker 1>and look at what people knew then and </v>

1876
01:33:06.901 --> 01:33:09.720
<v Speaker 1>they look at what people know today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>day out now it's like,</v>

1877
01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:14.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love watching it just because it's so </v>

1878
01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:14.980
<v Speaker 1>nostalgic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

1879
01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:16.150
<v Speaker 1>It's an unbelievable example of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>things have gotten super,</v>

1880
01:33:16.151 --> 01:33:17.050
<v Speaker 1>super complicated.</v>

1881
01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:17.980
<v Speaker 1>super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super quickly.</v>

1882
01:33:18.190 --> 01:33:23.190
<v Speaker 1>duck duesberg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that Colorado and </v>

1883
01:33:23.190 --> 01:33:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Washington state made marijuana legal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about time.</v>

1884
01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it beautiful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1885
01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:29.020
<v Speaker 1>They stepped up yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon fucked up Though.</v>

1886
01:33:29.050 --> 01:33:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sad for you.</v>

1887
01:33:30.970 --> 01:33:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Portland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>

1888
01:33:32.411 --> 01:33:37.411
<v Speaker 1>I dare you let that happen because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon is filled with a lot of white </v>

1889
01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:38.200
<v Speaker 1>gangsters out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chill son and type dudes out there.</v>

1890
01:33:38.230 --> 01:33:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they never like.</v>

1891
01:33:39.681 --> 01:33:41.750
<v Speaker 1>They're not down with these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>hippies work.</v>

1892
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Go to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hippie.</v>

1893
01:33:43.230 --> 01:33:46.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Oregon didn't pass it,</v>

1894
01:33:46.961 --> 01:33:50.540
<v Speaker 1>but Colorado did is legal I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1895
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Medical marijuana passed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts.</v>

1896
01:33:53.770 --> 01:33:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the federal government going to </v>

1897
01:33:58.770 --> 01:33:58.770
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can it exactly.</v>

1898
01:33:58.770 --> 01:34:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to shut down the </v>

1899
01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:02.040
<v Speaker 1>medical marijuana programs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dea might occasionally bus people,</v>

1900
01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:06.331
<v Speaker 1>encourage people to not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Threatened landlords and stuff like </v>

1901
01:34:06.331 --> 01:34:06.331
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really just essentially to keep</v>

1902
01:34:06.331 --> 01:34:10.981
<v Speaker 1>their business open with the da has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>been down to doing is they re these </v>

1903
01:34:11.051 --> 01:34:13.210
<v Speaker 1>medical marijuana dispensary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take all their weed,</v>

1904
01:34:13.211 --> 01:34:18.211
<v Speaker 1>they take all their cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say they're going to process the </v>

1905
01:34:18.211 --> 01:34:18.211
<v Speaker 1>information and then they never do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1906
01:34:18.211 --> 01:34:22.590
<v Speaker 1>So they basically just go in and crank </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody the gangsta cash they go in </v>

1907
01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:26.500
<v Speaker 1>with strapped with machine guns and ddh </v>
<v Speaker 1>agathy step on people's necks.</v>

1908
01:34:26.501 --> 01:34:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a jacking.</v>

1909
01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:33.660
<v Speaker 1>They go in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take all the weedy tickle them and </v>

1910
01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:33.760
<v Speaker 1>they can by federal law they can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosecute,</v>

1911
01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:37.450
<v Speaker 1>but yet they just sort of hold that case</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and they don't do anything about it.</v>

1912
01:34:37.451 --> 01:34:42.451
<v Speaker 1>And occasionally people get prosecuted </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they find out that they're doing </v>

1913
01:34:42.451 --> 01:34:43.000
<v Speaker 1>something like this is a lot of dudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>who got into the weed business that used</v>

1914
01:34:43.001 --> 01:34:44.950
<v Speaker 1>to be in the illegal business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1915
01:34:44.951 --> 01:34:47.590
<v Speaker 1>And so they're doing shit shady and guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>get busted,</v>

1916
01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:50.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>selling mass quantity taxes on it.</v>

1917
01:34:50.081 --> 01:34:55.081
<v Speaker 1>But with the real problem is you got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of guys in the dea that would </v>

1918
01:34:55.081 --> 01:34:58.141
<v Speaker 1>probably like to go bust scumbags and </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably like to actually make a dent in</v>

1919
01:34:58.701 --> 01:35:03.701
<v Speaker 1>their community and they're in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where something is law and </v>

1920
01:35:03.701 --> 01:35:03.701
<v Speaker 1>here's the law.</v>

1921
01:35:03.701 --> 01:35:04.810
<v Speaker 1>The law is they're doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to go do it.</v>

1922
01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:07.970
<v Speaker 1>They have to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like until you change the law,</v>

1923
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:13.030
<v Speaker 1>you have law enforcement officers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be wanting to enforce </v>

1924
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.280
<v Speaker 1>the law period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a simple written thing.</v>

1925
01:35:13.281 --> 01:35:15.980
<v Speaker 1>It's written down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most laws are stupid as fuck.</v>

1926
01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:21.010
<v Speaker 1>But the we agree on them on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's their job comes prostitution.</v>

1927
01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Sure they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hate,</v>

1928
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:28.130
<v Speaker 1>they hate having to give people speeding</v>
<v Speaker 1>tickets to sit there with a laser gun.</v>

1929
01:35:28.131 --> 01:35:29.870
<v Speaker 1>That's not what they signed up to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cop for.</v>

1930
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:34.990
<v Speaker 1>But it's part of the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we have to do is make it so that </v>

1931
01:35:34.990 --> 01:35:35.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not part of the fucking job and </v>
<v Speaker 1>give them,</v>

1932
01:35:35.650 --> 01:35:40.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the difference between going </v>

1933
01:35:40.650 --> 01:35:42.791
<v Speaker 1>to a medical marijuana dispensary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stepping on some kid's neck who's a </v>

1934
01:35:42.791 --> 01:35:46.241
<v Speaker 1>college student who just got in because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was high and took the job and going </v>

1935
01:35:46.241 --> 01:35:47.750
<v Speaker 1>to a meth lab is a very different </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

1936
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:48.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1937
01:35:48.351 --> 01:35:53.351
<v Speaker 1>you drive out into the middle of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>palmdale and you see a warehouse with </v>

1938
01:35:53.351 --> 01:35:55.580
<v Speaker 1>smoke coming out of it and you all storm</v>
<v Speaker 1>the building from email.</v>

1939
01:35:55.581 --> 01:35:57.920
<v Speaker 1>You might go into a bomb man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might go into,</v>

1940
01:35:57.921 --> 01:36:02.921
<v Speaker 1>somebody might drop some biker gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully machine guns out of their head</v>

1941
01:36:03.771 --> 01:36:05.870
<v Speaker 1>making shitty decisions being up for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

1942
01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dangerous as fuck.</v>

1943
01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Whereas they can go to a medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana dispensary and just walk in </v>

1944
01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:12.940
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1945
01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:15.350
<v Speaker 1>go take everybody's money and take your </v>
<v Speaker 1>business and scare the shit out of them.</v>

1946
01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:20.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not the da's fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dea or a bunch of guys that are </v>

1947
01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:23.920
<v Speaker 1>fucking dea agents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which if you're going to have like a </v>

1948
01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:25.340
<v Speaker 1>regular society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to recognize what's dangerous.</v>

1949
01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:27.710
<v Speaker 1>And the regular site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a healthy society,</v>

1950
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:30.290
<v Speaker 1>you've got to realize what's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and what's not.</v>

1951
01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:32.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying things should be illegal.</v>

1952
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:35.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you should go to jail for</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing anything,</v>

1953
01:36:35.210 --> 01:36:39.770
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying there should be certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences for knowingly and willfully</v>

1954
01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:44.980
<v Speaker 1>pushing addictive and dangerous drugs on</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like math.</v>

1955
01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:50.140
<v Speaker 1>There should be a social consequence for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and that's where something like the </v>

1956
01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:52.670
<v Speaker 1>dea should come into play to restrict </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit like that district.</v>

1957
01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:55.430
<v Speaker 1>When you get that shit into communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it poisons people.</v>

1958
01:36:55.431 --> 01:37:00.431
<v Speaker 1>It infects just like a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There should be massive amounts of </v>

1959
01:37:00.621 --> 01:37:03.350
<v Speaker 1>resources spent trying to stop that from</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

1960
01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:05.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly how you should do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1961
01:37:05.031 --> 01:37:09.260
<v Speaker 1>but having a dea is not a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having an agency,</v>

1962
01:37:09.261 --> 01:37:10.880
<v Speaker 1>just like we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fish and game,</v>

1963
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:14.630
<v Speaker 1>they regulate the wildlife and they do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great job.</v>

1964
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:19.870
<v Speaker 1>There could be a way of regulating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect of dangerous substances on the </v>

1965
01:37:19.870 --> 01:37:24.241
<v Speaker 1>american population because right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dealing with this whole bath </v>

1966
01:37:24.241 --> 01:37:27.131
<v Speaker 1>salt issue man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a real problem because they're </v>

1967
01:37:27.131 --> 01:37:27.131
<v Speaker 1>just taking a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to go to the bathroom,</v>

1968
01:37:27.131 --> 01:37:27.131
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

1969
01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:31.010
<v Speaker 1>You wanted to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get an article.</v>

1970
01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:36.370
<v Speaker 1>The bath salts thing is they're taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs and they just change one molecule </v>

1971
01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:41.740
<v Speaker 1>and they can say not for human </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption and sell it over the </v>

1972
01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:41.740
<v Speaker 1>counter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere you're.</v>

1973
01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:43.500
<v Speaker 1>There's an outlet that's not illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't.</v>

1974
01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:46.460
<v Speaker 1>They can't even do anything about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have to pass drugs for those and</v>

1975
01:37:46.461 --> 01:37:51.461
<v Speaker 1>then they just keep changing what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug is instead of calling it bath </v>

1976
01:37:51.461 --> 01:37:51.890
<v Speaker 1>salts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking garage sand call called whatever</v>

1977
01:37:51.891 --> 01:37:56.891
<v Speaker 1>the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as You say it's not for human </v>

1978
01:37:56.891 --> 01:37:56.891
<v Speaker 1>consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1979
01:37:56.891 --> 01:37:57.410
<v Speaker 1>lawn fertilizer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decoration,</v>

1980
01:37:57.420 --> 01:38:02.420
<v Speaker 1>make some shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could sell it all day long and </v>

1981
01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:04.950
<v Speaker 1>people figure out that it's there for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to smoke and get high and it's just </v>

1982
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:05.100
<v Speaker 1>like a meth with something changed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>share.</v>

1983
01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:10.250
<v Speaker 1>So having a dea is not a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having drugs like marijuana to be </v>

1984
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:11.480
<v Speaker 1>illegal is the bad idea.</v>

1985
01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:12.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1986
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Fucking government is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is there's too many people </v>

1987
01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:22.460
<v Speaker 1>and trying to manage 300 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous and trying to manage it by </v>

1988
01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:27.210
<v Speaker 1>having government nanny groups that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped you from doing a bunch of shit.</v>

1989
01:38:27.211 --> 01:38:32.211
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't hurt anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now you're just going to ruin the </v>

1990
01:38:32.211 --> 01:38:34.791
<v Speaker 1>listening to you about anything because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to listen to you about </v>

1991
01:38:34.791 --> 01:38:34.791
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1992
01:38:34.791 --> 01:38:38.211
<v Speaker 1>the marijuana argument is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>main reasons why people have a distrust </v>

1993
01:38:38.211 --> 01:38:41.031
<v Speaker 1>of cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about crime stopping or </v>

1994
01:38:41.031 --> 01:38:41.670
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea that I could be doing</v>

1995
01:38:41.671 --> 01:38:46.671
<v Speaker 1>something that I love doing and I got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look out for cops because if I get </v>

1996
01:38:46.671 --> 01:38:47.040
<v Speaker 1>busted doing something I love doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That hurts nolan.</v>

1997
01:38:47.190 --> 01:38:50.850
<v Speaker 1>I might wind up spending the night in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage somewhere with a bunch of criminals</v>

1998
01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:55.810
<v Speaker 1>can get you can get fall down drunk at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bar and,</v>

1999
01:38:55.811 --> 01:38:57.360
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that somehow.</v>

2000
01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can throw up into a garbage barrel </v>

2001
01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:03.420
<v Speaker 1>like many of us have done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2002
01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:07.420
<v Speaker 1>just a bunch of wind literally poisoned </v>
<v Speaker 1>by and people.</v>

2003
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:08.480
<v Speaker 1>People applaud it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

2004
01:39:08.490 --> 01:39:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I got so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I threw up in the curb.</v>

2005
01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:14.280
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so bad for you.</v>

2006
01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:19.281
<v Speaker 1>It's so stupid and it's everywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's complaining and there's all </v>

2007
01:39:19.281 --> 01:39:22.380
<v Speaker 1>these stupid people working so hard keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana illegal,</v>

2008
01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:24.780
<v Speaker 1>but we need to do is find jobs for those</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking people.</v>

2009
01:39:24.781 --> 01:39:29.781
<v Speaker 1>That's what we need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to have a compassIonate way of </v>

2010
01:39:29.781 --> 01:39:32.871
<v Speaker 1>looking at drug legalization and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ways is looking at the people that </v>

2011
01:39:32.871 --> 01:39:36.501
<v Speaker 1>are making a living from drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegalizing drugs being illegal and go </v>

2012
01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:42.171
<v Speaker 1>after those people with positivity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way to where they can make </v>

2013
01:39:42.171 --> 01:39:45.771
<v Speaker 1>a better living to transfer the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the dea that are responsible for </v>

2014
01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:49.740
<v Speaker 1>going after marijuana and find fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>better use for them.</v>

2015
01:39:49.970 --> 01:39:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Actually put them in in some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive function in the community </v>

2016
01:39:54.970 --> 01:39:57.660
<v Speaker 1>instead of being monetary vampires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're doing there.</v>

2017
01:39:57.670 --> 01:40:02.670
<v Speaker 1>They're jumping in and stealing money </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then suck it into their system and </v>

2018
01:40:02.670 --> 01:40:05.040
<v Speaker 1>nobody can ever get it back and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no case and nothing ever happens.</v>

2019
01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:10.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just like a gang stealing your </v>

2020
01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:13.821
<v Speaker 1>stash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all that is and that it does </v>

2021
01:40:13.821 --> 01:40:13.821
<v Speaker 1>affect a government's credibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it does.</v>

2022
01:40:13.890 --> 01:40:18.890
<v Speaker 1>It does when it's marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't act like it's 1950 </v>

2023
01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:19.350
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 2012.</v>

2024
01:40:19.351 --> 01:40:24.351
<v Speaker 1>Everybody can get on their phone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can google something and five </v>

2025
01:40:24.351 --> 01:40:24.640
<v Speaker 1>minutes and read all the bullet in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2026
01:40:24.650 --> 01:40:27.360
<v Speaker 1>they might called schizophrenia in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

2027
01:40:27.630 --> 01:40:30.960
<v Speaker 1>who's taken it and go and schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be a schizophrenia.</v>

2028
01:40:30.961 --> 01:40:35.961
<v Speaker 1>I also smoked weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're doing and you're </v>

2029
01:40:35.961 --> 01:40:37.290
<v Speaker 1>giVing 10 people fake weed and 10 people</v>
<v Speaker 1>real weed.</v>

2030
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:42.470
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even with all the pressure to make </v>

2031
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.470
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2032
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:45.360
<v Speaker 1>to make it a dangerous substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still can't find shit,</v>

2033
01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:50.900
<v Speaker 1>but yet it's illegal there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an embarrassment as a human </v>

2034
01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:54.741
<v Speaker 1>race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the elections are showing </v>

2035
01:40:54.741 --> 01:40:54.741
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2036
01:40:54.741 --> 01:40:56.860
<v Speaker 1>It's too fucking states out of 50 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>one had failed.</v>

2037
01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:02.200
<v Speaker 1>It was on the ballot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Momentum is moving forward in that </v>

2038
01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:02.200
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2039
01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:04.000
<v Speaker 1>It has to be hard to justify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I always say,</v>

2040
01:41:04.001 --> 01:41:09.001
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even a big weed smoker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just hard to justify how you make </v>

2041
01:41:09.001 --> 01:41:10.450
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic alcohol illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big way.</v>

2042
01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I like the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem also is that people </v>

2043
01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.850
<v Speaker 1>getting uneducated views on weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People think potheads lazy.</v>

2044
01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:20.410
<v Speaker 1>It was because there's two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of effects.</v>

2045
01:41:20.590 --> 01:41:25.590
<v Speaker 1>There's the endeca effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just like sleepy couchy affair </v>

2046
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:25.590
<v Speaker 1>because I don't like that.</v>

2047
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:26.980
<v Speaker 1>I go with the sativa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2048
01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:31.990
<v Speaker 1>if it was only in the weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would still smoke it every now and </v>

2049
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:35.161
<v Speaker 1>then when you wanted to chill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a nice meal hanging out with my </v>

2050
01:41:35.161 --> 01:41:35.161
<v Speaker 1>lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my lady I said,</v>

2051
01:41:35.161 --> 01:41:37.490
<v Speaker 1>or like a black man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No irony whatsoever.</v>

2052
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Hang on lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My special lady.</v>

2053
01:41:39.671 --> 01:41:42.790
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I much prefer sativa.</v>

2054
01:41:42.791 --> 01:41:47.791
<v Speaker 1>Sativa is what you have before you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>an interesting conversation or I have </v>

2055
01:41:47.791 --> 01:41:51.781
<v Speaker 1>energy on that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different effect and it's not a </v>

2056
01:41:51.781 --> 01:41:54.241
<v Speaker 1>lazy effect and the reason why people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know is because we're in a </v>

2057
01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:58.410
<v Speaker 1>terrible situation where we have a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of uneducated or uninformed people that </v>

2058
01:41:58.410 --> 01:42:03.121
<v Speaker 1>are dictating policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at things in the wrong </v>

2059
01:42:03.121 --> 01:42:03.121

<v Speaker 1>We've had this conversation without you </v>

2082
01:43:01.561 --> 01:43:05.101

<v Speaker 4>All that for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I signed it for you.</v>

2113
01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:28.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a very brave man.</v>

2114
01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're right.</v>

2115
01:44:29.850 --> 01:44:31.610
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like you are,</v>

2116
01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:36.760
<v Speaker 1>but I'm too stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we had a guy here was equally </v>

2117
01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:36.760
<v Speaker 1>bright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who opposed you,</v>

2118
01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I would be baffled and stuck in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>

2119
01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:38.810
<v Speaker 1>We'd both be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2120
01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:39.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2122
01:44:40.041 --> 01:44:42.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's what you've done in this belief</v>

2123
01:44:42.901 --> 01:44:44.450
<v Speaker 1>and that you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very,</v>

2124
01:44:44.451 --> 01:44:47.990
<v Speaker 1>a very brave thing and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting story and it's,</v>

2125
01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:53.100
<v Speaker 1>I've never really quite understood the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole academic process and what's </v>

2126
01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:53.610
<v Speaker 1>involved and only like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2127
01:44:53.670 --> 01:44:55.660
<v Speaker 1>looked at it from the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to,</v>

2128
01:44:55.661 --> 01:45:00.661
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hear you describing what it's been </v>

2129
01:45:00.661 --> 01:45:02.711
<v Speaker 1>like trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to make an argument for this and </v>

2130
01:45:02.711 --> 01:45:04.490
<v Speaker 1>being treated in what seems to be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unscientific way.</v>

2131
01:45:04.491 --> 01:45:07.130
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be a biased and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2132
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:08.440
<v Speaker 1>and really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2133
01:45:08.441 --> 01:45:12.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's actually damaging to the</v>

2134
01:45:12.531 --> 01:45:16.130
<v Speaker 1>distribution of information because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there should be,</v>

2135
01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:18.920
<v Speaker 1>if you are a respected scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you are,</v>

2136
01:45:19.190 --> 01:45:21.740
<v Speaker 1>there should be some concerted effort to</v>
<v Speaker 1>prove you wrong.</v>

2137
01:45:21.770 --> 01:45:23.180
<v Speaker 1>There should be some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2138
01:45:23.181 --> 01:45:25.520
<v Speaker 1>it seems like you've made enough waves </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your book.</v>

2139
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:30.550
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a prestigious enough position </v>

2140
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.550
<v Speaker 1>at the university of California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>berkeley,</v>

2141
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:33.970
<v Speaker 1>that you should be considered and at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least refuted by the people that </v>

2142
01:45:33.970 --> 01:45:35.030
<v Speaker 1>continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of doing that,</v>

2143
01:45:35.031 --> 01:45:36.170
<v Speaker 1>they've decided to ignore you.</v>

2144
01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:41.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Judy's underhanded things like </v>

2145
01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:43.490
<v Speaker 4>underhanded tongues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a misconduct investigation,</v>

2146
01:45:43.491 --> 01:45:45.530
<v Speaker 4>which is pretty heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when did they do that?</v>

2147
01:45:45.610 --> 01:45:48.230
<v Speaker 4>It was a one and a half years ago until </v>
<v Speaker 4>they hear about the cocaine.</v>

2148
01:45:48.231 --> 01:45:53.231
<v Speaker 4>You're doing coke with students that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that's a podcast well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>century.</v>

2175
01:46:57.571 --> 01:46:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>

2176
01:46:57.991 --> 01:47:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Which required the labeling of products </v>
<v Speaker 1>to disclose the contents,</v>

2177
01:47:01.201 --> 01:47:02.520
<v Speaker 1>including alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morphine,</v>

2178
01:47:02.521 --> 01:47:03.690
<v Speaker 1>opium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>

2179
01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:05.470
<v Speaker 1>heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alpha or beta.</v>

2180
01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:08.050
<v Speaker 1>So what it essentially is saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2181
01:47:08.051 --> 01:47:09.120
<v Speaker 1>cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much different things,</v>

2182
01:47:09.121 --> 01:47:13.590
<v Speaker 1>but there was no labeling back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was the first effort.</v>

2183
01:47:13.591 --> 01:47:15.600
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't necessarily that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>making it illegal,</v>

2184
01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:20.720
<v Speaker 1>but they let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the comprehensive drug abuse </v>

2185
01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:22.590
<v Speaker 1>prevention and control act passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in 1970,</v>

2186
01:47:22.830 --> 01:47:26.740
<v Speaker 1>that's when a cocaine saturday only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2187
01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:30.840
<v Speaker 1>they regulated and taxed opiate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin in 1915.</v>

2188
01:47:30.930 --> 01:47:34.570
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't until 1970.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's You're saying is true that the</v>

2189
01:47:34.590 --> 01:47:39.090
<v Speaker 1>after the post Vietnam war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people from that era fourth,</v>

2190
01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:41.940
<v Speaker 1>that's when the real drug problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>started in America.</v>

2191
01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:43.740
<v Speaker 1>And in nineTeen 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when,</v>

2192
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:45.860
<v Speaker 1>that's when they cracked down on all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics.</v>

2193
01:47:46.110 --> 01:47:49.790
<v Speaker 1>That's when you know mushrooms and acid </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything else became law,</v>

2194
01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:54.800
<v Speaker 1>which is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you think that all those years </v>

2195
01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:56.961
<v Speaker 1>before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though marijuana has been illegal </v>

2196
01:47:56.961 --> 01:47:57.060
<v Speaker 1>since the thirties asset and mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that shit,</v>

2197
01:47:57.090 --> 01:48:02.090
<v Speaker 1>they were illegal until 19 crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No other music was so good,</v>

2198
01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:03.930
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No wonder,</v>

2199
01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:09.370
<v Speaker 1>no wonder the beatles were as lonely </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2200
01:48:09.580 --> 01:48:14.580
<v Speaker 1>They were in tune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't make the doors with the white </v>

2201
01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:16.560
<v Speaker 1>album.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy album man door songs like,</v>

2202
01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:18.630

2203
01:48:18.631 --> 01:48:20.350

2204
01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:23.460
<v Speaker 1>And I'll say it also ensures you die.</v>
