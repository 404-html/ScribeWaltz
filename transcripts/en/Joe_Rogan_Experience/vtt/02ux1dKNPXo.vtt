00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

3
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.710
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

4
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.963
<v Speaker 1>Hello Tim.</v>

5
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.923
<v Speaker 1>How's it going?</v>

6
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for finally being here.</v>

7
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.751
<v Speaker 1>Long story,</v>

8
00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:10.584
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I definitely drank too much coffee before we get here.</v>

10
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:13.190
<v Speaker 1>So if I appear,</v>

11
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>appear like cracked out,</v>

12
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God I'm not in pills but I'm glad to hear it.</v>

13
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.623
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

14
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.630
<v Speaker 1>so we had a nice conversation on the phone about d platforming and social media</v>

15
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.300
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

16
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.190
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

17
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>what was very obvious to me in talking to you was that your way more schooled on</v>

18
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:32.214
<v Speaker 1>this than I am.</v>

19
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I wanted to have this conversation with you because part of what</v>

20
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

21
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I've really listened to my podcast with Jack and um,</v>

22
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>you had a good criticism of it.</v>

23
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I agree with a lot of what you said.</v>

24
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:43.951
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

25
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>I agree that it was kind of boring and it was,</v>

26
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>I think in many,</v>

27
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>for many reasons it was my fault.</v>

28
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

29
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I prepared enough for it and I also don't think I understood the</v>

30
00:00:55.651 --> 00:01:00.651
<v Speaker 1>magnitude of how other people felt about d platforming on twitter and in all</v>

31
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.851
<v Speaker 1>social media,</v>

32
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>youtube and all these different things.</v>

33
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>And what the ramifications are and how,</v>

34
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>how much this means to people to have very clear and obvious,</v>

35
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.090
<v Speaker 1>obvious free speech outside of very egregious examples of like threats and</v>

36
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>doxing and things like that.</v>

37
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Which I think we can all agree,</v>

38
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:21.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

39
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.910
<v Speaker 1>I think this problem might be one of the,</v>

40
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 1>like one of the worst problems we're facing right now.</v>

41
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Politically.</v>

42
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

43
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>You know that twitter is where public discourse is happening.</v>

44
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>It's where journalists are and this is a problem sourcing a lot of their</v>

45
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

46
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:39.260
<v Speaker 1>So if you have somebody who is completely removed from public discourse that</v>

48
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.113
<v Speaker 1>that's exile,</v>

49
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.970
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

51
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine why some people kind of lose their minds when that happens.</v>

52
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.960
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

53
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I think going into that conversation with him,</v>

54
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>well that's what I wanted it to be.</v>

55
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>That's why I don't really interview people any kind of,</v>

56
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>have conversations with them.</v>

57
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally we have disagreements and we,</v>

58
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>we talk about things and you know,</v>

60
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

61
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a,</v>

62
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>like a mandate.</v>

63
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>My only,</v>

64
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 1>the only thing I wanted to get out of the conversation is I wonder to find out</v>

65
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>what it was like to start that organization and to have no idea when you were</v>

66
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:15.360
<v Speaker 1>doing it that it was going to be essentially like one of the most important</v>

67
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.930
<v Speaker 1>distribution at a real avenues for information and act and act as an activist.</v>

68
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>A buddy of mine asked me if I knew why people smashed windows smashed starbucks.</v>

69
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not because they think they're going to cause damage.</v>

70
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.840
<v Speaker 1>It's because they want to strike a symbol down of something.</v>

71
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.760
<v Speaker 1>They view a process them.</v>

72
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Jack Dorsey is that symbol to a lot of people and you know to see.</v>

73
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.830
<v Speaker 1>You know what I was saying earlier is I think a lot of people look at you.</v>

74
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.733
<v Speaker 1>You're like a real dude.</v>

75
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>You know your.</v>

76
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Your conversations are real.</v>

77
00:02:42.671 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>You have.</v>

78
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.540
<v Speaker 1>You're not one of these fake news journalists that people are very critical of</v>

79
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:46.160
<v Speaker 1>that field there.</v>

80
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>They're biased or an agenda.</v>

81
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>So when you sit down with Jack Dorsey and doesn't go anywhere,</v>

82
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.280
<v Speaker 1>people then feel like the last person who not supposed to let us down.</v>

83
00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Let us down,</v>

84
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.713
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

85
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

86
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.640
<v Speaker 1>I failed you twice as much.</v>

87
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 1>I felt it and I noticed that I got</v>

88
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 2>more hate for that one.</v>

89
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:05.340
<v Speaker 2>Then probably anything that I've ever done and you know,</v>

90
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a guy who shies away from criticism.</v>

91
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 2>I try to figure out what I did wrong and try to regroup and figure out how to</v>

92
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 2>approach it again.</v>

93
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.030
<v Speaker 2>And in Jack's defense I think he's very open to talking about anything.</v>

94
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:24.001
<v Speaker 2>And also he's also very open for self criticism when he was openly discussing</v>

95
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing wrong,</v>

96
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 2>where they need to be clear,</v>

97
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 2>where the navy to get better.</v>

98
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.033
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe any of it.</v>

99
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust that guy.</v>

100
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>

101
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.053
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

102
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 2>why don't you trust him.</v>

104
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

105
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

106
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 2>there's the obvious thing that is running these a bunch of companies.</v>

107
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 2>I could be wrong,</v>

108
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 2>but I believe he actually left twitter.</v>

109
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't the CEO for a while.</v>

110
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 2>They brought them back in or something,</v>

111
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 2>but it either sounds like should probably check on that.</v>

112
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 2>So I try to avoid asserting things that I'm not 100 percent sure on,</v>

113
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:51.251
<v Speaker 2>but me too.</v>

114
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:52.010
<v Speaker 2>But I do it all the time.</v>

115
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.843
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

116
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 2>Jack says things like,</v>

117
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 2>you said to you,</v>

118
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 2>he said to Congress,</v>

119
00:03:57.251 --> 00:03:58.390
<v Speaker 2>I believe he said he's had to Congress.</v>

120
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 2>We don't ban people based on the content.</v>

121
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 2>We ban people based on their conduct.</v>

122
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

123
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 2>You literally have a terms of service that band specific content.</v>

124
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you mean you don't pay people based on content?</v>

125
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.223
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

126
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

127
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I'll just get into naming some people.</v>

128
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:13.391
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

129
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 2>Meghan Murphy for example,</v>

130
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:14.921
<v Speaker 2>as a feminine.</v>

131
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:15.471
<v Speaker 2>Megan Murphy.</v>

132
00:04:15.471 --> 00:04:15.971
<v Speaker 2>Is She okay?</v>

133
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 2>She's that woman that the whole issue with women.</v>

134
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

135
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.081
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

136
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 2>so this is what's important.</v>

137
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 2>She was responding to somebody.</v>

138
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Explain that.</v>

139
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 2>So this could be standalone because we talked about it yesterday with Sam</v>

140
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.861
<v Speaker 2>Harris,</v>

141
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:27.694
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

142
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.590
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know too much about Meghan Murphy,</v>

143
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 2>but she's a feminist.</v>

144
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.301
<v Speaker 2>She's a,</v>

145
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:33.430
<v Speaker 2>what they call a trans exclusionary radical feminist.</v>

146
00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 2>But I think that that might be offensive.</v>

147
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Says let's remember why Jack Dorsey was fired as twitter CEO.</v>

148
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.363
<v Speaker 2>He was fired.</v>

149
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

150
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 2>We'll see what it says.</v>

151
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.090
<v Speaker 2>This isn't fortune 2008.</v>

152
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.050
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>

153
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't even.</v>

154
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.490
<v Speaker 2>It was sort of twitter.</v>

155
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

156
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

157
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.523
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand eight.</v>

158
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.483
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

159
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm Dorsey's management was so problematic.</v>

160
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.113
<v Speaker 2>Twitter's board,</v>

161
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 2>this is an opinion piece.</v>

162
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.510
<v Speaker 2>Fired him in 2008 offering him a passive chairman role and silent board seat</v>

163
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 2>2010.</v>

164
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 2>He was founding square,</v>

165
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.601
<v Speaker 2>square.</v>

166
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:02.434
<v Speaker 2>He went rogue.</v>

167
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:03.813
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

168
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 2>so something happened.</v>

169
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:05.381
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

170
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Speaker 2>it's funny as you called it an opinion piece,</v>

171
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:07.834
<v Speaker 2>but do they.</v>

172
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

173
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.221
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

174
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:10.780
<v Speaker 2>that's where we're at in journalism today.</v>

175
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Well when someone says,</v>

176
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.921
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

177
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 2>it has to be an opinion piece.</v>

178
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 2>When someone says was so problematic.</v>

179
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:14.981
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

180
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:15.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's an opinion.</v>

181
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 2>The real facts are he was fired,</v>

182
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

183
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 2>you could state the specific reason that was stated by the company and that</v>

184
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 2>would be a non opinion piece,</v>

185
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as you flavor it,</v>

186
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.110
<v Speaker 2>it's all opinion,</v>

187
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

188
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.531
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

189
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:26.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

190
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

191
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.720
<v Speaker 2>That is a,</v>

192
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 2>that is an issue,</v>

193
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:28.901
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

194
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:29.950
<v Speaker 2>With information,</v>

195
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:31.290
<v Speaker 2>that distribution of information.</v>

196
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.480
<v Speaker 2>It's flavored by opinion in ideology.</v>

197
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.990
<v Speaker 2>All of it.</v>

198
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

199
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 2>All of it.</v>

200
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.561
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

201
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:36.350
<v Speaker 2>we can talk about that,</v>

202
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.170
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to derail anything.</v>

203
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

204
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:38.801
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

205
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:39.670
<v Speaker 2>So Megan Murphy,</v>

206
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.533
<v Speaker 2>please explain it.</v>

207
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 2>She was a feminist.</v>

208
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 2>She said she's a.</v>

209
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.030
<v Speaker 2>So she's called her a trans exclusionary.</v>

210
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 2>I look,</v>

211
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.990
<v Speaker 2>I understand this is offensive,</v>

212
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

213
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.840
<v Speaker 2>I guess calling someone a trans exclusionary radical feminist,</v>

214
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming that was offensive.</v>

215
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 2>It's just used in a defensive way I suppose to them to her offensive against,</v>

216
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 2>against people like her.</v>

217
00:05:57.801 --> 00:05:58.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

218
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 2>So there's intersectional feminists.</v>

219
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 2>They tend to be trans inclusive,</v>

220
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.840
<v Speaker 2>meaning that they believe that someone who's born biological,</v>

221
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 2>biological male can compete with those bylaws biologically female if they</v>

222
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 2>transition,</v>

223
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 2>if they take hormones and things like that can compete,</v>

224
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 2>compete,</v>

225
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

226
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Like power lifting,</v>

227
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 2>racing bikes,</v>

228
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 2>biking and stuff.</v>

229
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 2>That's where I step in.</v>

230
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

231
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:18.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

232
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some stuff you've talked about,</v>

233
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

234
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 2>the Trans exclusionary group think they shouldn't and they've said things that</v>

235
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:25.080
<v Speaker 2>are considered to be part.</v>

236
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 2>I say consider it to be offensive.</v>

237
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to assert who is offended by it,</v>

238
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 2>but there's one recent story where a trans,</v>

239
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 2>exclusionary,</v>

240
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 2>radical feminist said that the trans rights movement as a men's rights movement,</v>

241
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:36.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

242
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.153
<v Speaker 2>They say things like that.</v>

243
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 2>In the case of Meghan Murphy,</v>

244
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.310
<v Speaker 2>she responded to someone.</v>

245
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

246
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 2>men aren't women though.</v>

247
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 2>That's not harassment.</v>

248
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

249
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 2>That was a conversation with somebody else.</v>

250
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.641
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

251
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 2>it's also a fact she was permanently banned.</v>

252
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.921
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

253
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:49.690
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy,</v>

254
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

255
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 2>That saying men aren't women.</v>

256
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

257
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.091
<v Speaker 2>out of context,</v>

258
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 2>just say it right there.</v>

259
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:54.764
<v Speaker 2>Men are women.</v>

260
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck's gonna argue with that?</v>

261
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

262
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you say trans people.</v>

263
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.821
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

264
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 2>now you're into gray area,</v>

265
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 2>but actually the statement,</v>

266
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:02.420
<v Speaker 2>men aren't women.</v>

267
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

268
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to take it in context.</v>

269
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

270
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.711
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

271
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

272
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 2>But this is where we start getting into the nitty gritty of,</v>

273
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.300
<v Speaker 2>I guess left wing ideologies.</v>

274
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.173
<v Speaker 2>The culture war.</v>

275
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 2>If you go on wikipedia and you look up,</v>

276
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.130
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

277
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 2>it will tell you a man is an adult human male.</v>

278
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

279
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.960
<v Speaker 2>But if you look up trans man,</v>

280
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.760
<v Speaker 2>it will say a transplant is a man and so the transection of Wikipedia is at odds</v>

281
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.760
<v Speaker 2>factually with the main section.</v>

282
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.620
<v Speaker 2>So there was an.</v>

283
00:07:29.621 --> 00:07:30.021
<v Speaker 2>I bring this up,</v>

284
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:31.010
<v Speaker 2>is that when it comes to twitter,</v>

285
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:33.080
<v Speaker 2>then we can clearly see the bias.</v>

286
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.970
<v Speaker 2>Twitter says you can't misgender someone and presumably that's why Meghan Murphy</v>

287
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:38.804
<v Speaker 2>was banned.</v>

288
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.621
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

289
00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 2>That's a left wing ideology.</v>

290
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

291
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 2>But that's what she's talking about.</v>

292
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:44.000
<v Speaker 2>A specific human.</v>

293
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 2>I think she was.</v>

294
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.060
<v Speaker 2>I think they were having a conversation about somebody.</v>

295
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:49.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the full details details,</v>

296
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.151
<v Speaker 2>but I got to say,</v>

297
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 2>look right now people are being banned or suspended for saying learn to code.</v>

298
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:54.621
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

299
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

300
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

301
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Speaker 2>What is that about?</v>

302
00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:57.380
<v Speaker 2>You explained that to me too,</v>

303
00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.030
<v Speaker 2>and I saw a few people getting,</v>

304
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.620
<v Speaker 2>but should we start one at a time?</v>

305
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.981
<v Speaker 2>Should we.</v>

306
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:01.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

307
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.181
<v Speaker 2>let's stick with Megan.</v>

308
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:02.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

309
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.220
<v Speaker 2>I think we've,</v>

310
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:03.401
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

311
00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:03.650
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

312
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 2>we've reached the point of Meghan,</v>

313
00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:05.971
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

314
00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 2>She was banned for having a conversation and saying men aren't women though.</v>

315
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:09.170
<v Speaker 2>That was the quote.</v>

316
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Men who aren't women though,</v>

317
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:10.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

318
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.200
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

319
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.050
<v Speaker 2>And they're saying that they would never ban someone for content.</v>

320
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.860
<v Speaker 2>They banned them for behavior.</v>

321
00:08:16.861 --> 00:08:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

322
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.080
<v Speaker 2>So if we use that behavior that I have no idea,</v>

323
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:21.561
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

324
00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:21.920
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

325
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.230
<v Speaker 2>if you are using twitter the way twitter was designed to engage and respond to</v>

326
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.420
<v Speaker 2>people is that bad conduct.</v>

327
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.111
<v Speaker 2>It can't be conduct.</v>

328
00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 2>It literally can't be conduct.</v>

329
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

330
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.283
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

331
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.830
<v Speaker 2>aren't you allowed to have opinions that are in fact based in biology?</v>

332
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

333
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:38.860
<v Speaker 2>You should be in.</v>

334
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.840
<v Speaker 2>I have myself before we go any further before you get called alt right,</v>

335
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.430
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

336
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:43.221
<v Speaker 2>you're very left,</v>

337
00:08:43.221 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

338
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

339
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:44.711
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

340
00:08:44.711 --> 00:08:44.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

341
00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I typically say center left center look like,</v>

342
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:47.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

343
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:49.760
<v Speaker 2>People were saying how many times someone commented,</v>

344
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:53.750
<v Speaker 2>how many times will tim mentioned he's a social liberal laying on center left.</v>

345
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

346
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.820
<v Speaker 2>I was a big fan of Bernie Bernie Sanders.</v>

347
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 2>He's still one of my favorite politicians.</v>

348
00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:59.683
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

349
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 2>people then call me a socialist.</v>

350
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:01.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

351
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.071
<v Speaker 2>conservatives call me,</v>

352
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:02.460
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

353
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 2>left calls me write whatever.</v>

354
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 2>These labels are so fucking toxic.</v>

355
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:08.560
<v Speaker 2>It's so confusing to people and it.</v>

356
00:09:08.561 --> 00:09:10.110
<v Speaker 2>And it causes so much,</v>

357
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.910
<v Speaker 2>so much division between two sides that might not even differ that much.</v>

358
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:15.481
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

359
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing about it,</v>

360
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:21.351
<v Speaker 2>as I got my start during occupy Wall Street and conservatives called me far left</v>

361
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 2>because I was reporting on the protests,</v>

362
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:25.291
<v Speaker 2>what they were doing,</v>

363
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:26.250
<v Speaker 2>police brutality,</v>

364
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.271
<v Speaker 2>the arrests.</v>

365
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 2>They said this is a far left activists now that I'm,</v>

366
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 2>I've always been critical of the more extreme factions.</v>

367
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Like I've got interviews from seven,</v>

368
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:35.701
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

369
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:37.410
<v Speaker 2>seven years ago where I'm critical of these people.</v>

370
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Now all of a sudden they're accusing me of being alt right for being critical of</v>

371
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:43.920
<v Speaker 2>extremists and masks,</v>

372
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:44.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

373
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:45.170
<v Speaker 2>starting fires and things like that.</v>

374
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 2>All adjacent.</v>

375
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:47.061
<v Speaker 2>That's my new favorite.</v>

376
00:09:47.061 --> 00:09:47.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

377
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.980
<v Speaker 2>Boot licker out right at Jason Wu boot Licker boot,</v>

378
00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:50.281
<v Speaker 2>licker.</v>

379
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:50.461
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

380
00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

381
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:50.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

382
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:54.720
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of phrases that people use that mean literally nothing boot Lifton</v>

383
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of one of my favorites is to keep it in the context of twitter.</v>

384
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.540
<v Speaker 2>They say freedom of speech,</v>

385
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.760
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequence.</v>

386
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.400
<v Speaker 2>That literally doesn't mean anything.</v>

387
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:06.750
<v Speaker 2>It literally means nothing.</v>

388
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:07.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

389
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:07.621
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

390
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:09.690
<v Speaker 2>that's just trying to skirt around freedom of speech.</v>

391
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:10.500
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

392
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.210
<v Speaker 2>So what ends up happening,</v>

393
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 2>but you agree with the like you should be able to speak your mind,</v>

394
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:19.230
<v Speaker 2>but there's certain consequences of certain things that you say.</v>

395
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.300
<v Speaker 2>If I throw this bottle at the wall,</v>

396
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:22.021
<v Speaker 2>there's a consequence.</v>

397
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:23.660
<v Speaker 2>So that's a physical move motion.</v>

398
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.690
<v Speaker 2>If I drink this water,</v>

399
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:25.261
<v Speaker 2>there's a consequence.</v>

400
00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:25.841
<v Speaker 2>Talked about the bathroom.</v>

401
00:10:25.841 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

402
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.970
<v Speaker 2>So to to to point out that actions have consequences,</v>

403
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.570
<v Speaker 2>not actually addressing any of the issues.</v>

404
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.340
<v Speaker 2>It's just literally saying nothing,</v>

405
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

406
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

407
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.463
<v Speaker 2>it's almost,</v>

408
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:35.790
<v Speaker 2>it's just like a.</v>

409
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:40.791
<v Speaker 2>You can predict when someone will say it and it's usually when a specific person</v>

410
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.390
<v Speaker 2>is band,</v>

411
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.560
<v Speaker 2>they'll say freedom of speech,</v>

412
00:10:43.561 --> 00:10:44.101
<v Speaker 2>freedom of consequence,</v>

413
00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:44.934
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

414
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:45.901
<v Speaker 2>They don't say it when it's there,</v>

415
00:10:45.901 --> 00:10:46.201
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

416
00:10:46.201 --> 00:10:46.950
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

417
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:47.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

418
00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:48.050
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

419
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.370
<v Speaker 2>but this is true too in talking about twitter censorship,</v>

420
00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:53.580
<v Speaker 2>there are people on the left who have been banned unjustly and this is where it</v>

421
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:55.230
<v Speaker 2>gets actually scarier in my opinion.</v>

422
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:56.440
<v Speaker 2>You'll have,</v>

423
00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.870
<v Speaker 2>I could name so many people,</v>

424
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.510
<v Speaker 2>just Jesse Kelly was banned for no reason and CJ Pearson was bad.</v>

425
00:11:00.511 --> 00:11:02.060
<v Speaker 2>I think why you say no reason why?</v>

426
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:02.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

427
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:03.620
<v Speaker 2>they have no records.</v>

428
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:04.410
<v Speaker 2>That was an accident.</v>

429
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:04.651
<v Speaker 2>Oops.</v>

430
00:11:04.651 --> 00:11:07.100
<v Speaker 2>They said it was an accident plan for life or band.</v>

431
00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:08.480
<v Speaker 2>He was a short amount of time.</v>

432
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:08.660
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

433
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.000
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

434
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.990
<v Speaker 2>So I could be wrong.</v>

435
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.390
<v Speaker 2>My understanding is Jesse Kelly who was a conservative,</v>

436
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:16.440
<v Speaker 2>had his account just bent and there was a huge stink in the media.</v>

437
00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:16.681
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

438
00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:16.831
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

439
00:11:16.831 --> 00:11:16.971
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

440
00:11:16.971 --> 00:11:17.051
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

441
00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:17.851
<v Speaker 2>This guy didn't do anything.</v>

442
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Who is Jesse killing the conservative guy,</v>

443
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:20.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

444
00:11:20.431 --> 00:11:20.581
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

445
00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:20.821
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

446
00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:22.260
<v Speaker 2>he posted snarky tweets.</v>

447
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.780
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't harass people or anything is a verified twitter user.</v>

448
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.630
<v Speaker 2>So a bunch of stories came up saying what,</v>

449
00:11:26.631 --> 00:11:29.030
<v Speaker 2>what is this twitter then reinstates and said it was uh,</v>

450
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.371
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>

451
00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:30.204
<v Speaker 2>it was a mistake.</v>

452
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.620
<v Speaker 2>Now is it possible that they're just dealing with blunt tools and that there was</v>

453
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:36.070
<v Speaker 2>a mistake or.</v>

454
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:36.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

455
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

456
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:37.860
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

457
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.693
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

458
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.630
<v Speaker 2>But then I'd have to.</v>

459
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.380
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I don't think it was a mistake very simply as for one,</v>

460
00:11:43.381 --> 00:11:45.720
<v Speaker 2>we can see the ideological bent to their rules,</v>

461
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.000
<v Speaker 2>but then you look at someone like Milo Yiannopoulos,</v>

462
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:48.870
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

463
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of Milo.</v>

464
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.570
<v Speaker 2>I have to make sure that everybody knows that,</v>

465
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.580
<v Speaker 2>but just because I'm critical of the actions taken against them,</v>

466
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:55.480
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean I support him,</v>

467
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.591
<v Speaker 2>but why was he banned?</v>

468
00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:57.161
<v Speaker 2>Because he tweeted it.</v>

469
00:11:57.161 --> 00:11:57.994
<v Speaker 2>Leslie Jones.</v>

470
00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:58.960
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

471
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.500
<v Speaker 2>And the idea was that his tweet caused his fans to attacker,</v>

472
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.780
<v Speaker 2>which I think is.</v>

473
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 2>That's a stretch.</v>

474
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:06.370
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

475
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:06.551
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

476
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:06.970
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>

477
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:07.701
<v Speaker 2>that's just ridiculous.</v>

478
00:12:07.701 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 2>He didn't say go get her.</v>

479
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.450
<v Speaker 2>He didn't say attacker.</v>

480
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 2>He was tweeting at her.</v>

481
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

482
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.631
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

483
00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:13.181
<v Speaker 2>what did he call her?</v>

484
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Ugly.</v>

485
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.351
<v Speaker 2>Did he say something like,</v>

486
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:15.340
<v Speaker 2>since he was insulting or.</v>

487
00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:15.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

488
00:12:15.421 --> 00:12:16.220
<v Speaker 2>I think you called her ugly.</v>

489
00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:16.570
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

490
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:21.310
<v Speaker 2>he was mocking this feminist version of ghostbusters.</v>

491
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:21.670
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

492
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.360
<v Speaker 2>That's what he was doing.</v>

493
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:22.901
<v Speaker 2>He was talking.</v>

494
00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:24.550
<v Speaker 2>It was like a critique of the movie.</v>

495
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

496
00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 2>I've had milo in the podcast way back in the day.</v>

497
00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:28.570
<v Speaker 2>I had them on twice.</v>

498
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.710
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed talking to him.</v>

499
00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:30.544
<v Speaker 2>He's hilarious.</v>

500
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 2>He's very smart.</v>

501
00:12:31.781 --> 00:12:32.710
<v Speaker 2>He's very witty.</v>

502
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:33.790
<v Speaker 2>He's a character.</v>

503
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:35.290
<v Speaker 2>He's very much a provocateur,</v>

504
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:36.790
<v Speaker 2>but he's also,</v>

505
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:37.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

506
00:12:37.661 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 2>he's pushing buttons on purpose,</v>

507
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.590
<v Speaker 2>like he's trying to get reactions from people trolling.</v>

508
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

509
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:44.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

510
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 2>I almost think like he married a black guy,</v>

511
00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:47.920
<v Speaker 2>just let people know he's not gay.</v>

512
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:49.121
<v Speaker 2>Let people know brother.</v>

513
00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:49.841
<v Speaker 2>He's not racist.</v>

514
00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:51.950
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious in the way I.</v>

515
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.480
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

516
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.120
<v Speaker 2>I would never say something like that either,</v>

517
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.390
<v Speaker 2>but I almost think it,</v>

518
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:56.100
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

519
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.640
<v Speaker 2>You can understand why Milo would do that.</v>

520
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:58.540
<v Speaker 2>He's calculated.</v>

521
00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

522
00:12:58.980 --> 00:12:59.101
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

523
00:12:59.101 --> 00:12:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

524
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.940
<v Speaker 2>But he did that.</v>

525
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:01.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he did that.</v>

526
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:02.411
<v Speaker 2>It should be clear,</v>

527
00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:05.350
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that's how much of an act.</v>

528
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:06.640
<v Speaker 2>A lot of what's going on.</v>

529
00:13:06.641 --> 00:13:08.290
<v Speaker 2>But if you talk to him off camera,</v>

530
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.760
<v Speaker 2>he's a very nice guy.</v>

531
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.631
<v Speaker 2>Very reasonable,</v>

532
00:13:10.631 --> 00:13:11.464
<v Speaker 2>very polite.</v>

533
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

534
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust them.</v>

535
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:14.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

536
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:14.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a big fan.</v>

537
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.121
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

538
00:13:15.121 --> 00:13:15.221
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

539
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

540
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.971
<v Speaker 2>he fat,</v>

541
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:16.870
<v Speaker 2>shamed to do it at the gym.</v>

542
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

543
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Literally is a picture of my.</v>

544
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.280
<v Speaker 2>I'll make a photo of a guy at the gym,</v>

545
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:22.123
<v Speaker 2>the gym,</v>

546
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.710
<v Speaker 2>and I actually argue with them about.</v>

547
00:13:23.711 --> 00:13:24.820
<v Speaker 2>At one point I was like,</v>

548
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.863
<v Speaker 2>you won,</v>

549
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Speaker 2>you won.</v>

550
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.041
<v Speaker 2>You're skinny.</v>

551
00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:27.610
<v Speaker 2>He's fat,</v>

552
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.443
<v Speaker 2>but no you can.</v>

553
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.610
<v Speaker 2>You literally shamed him to the point where you decided to go to the gym to</v>

554
00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:32.020
<v Speaker 2>better himself and you're still making fun of him.</v>

555
00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.970
<v Speaker 2>So did he would've been he shamed him before the guy went to the gym?</v>

556
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

557
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.303
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

558
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean literally.</v>

559
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:40.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean like Milo's rhetoric of shaming people and getting them saying they're</v>

560
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.190
<v Speaker 2>nasty and stuff and then it.</v>

561
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

562
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.950
<v Speaker 2>But at the guy listened to them and that's why he went to the gym.</v>

563
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:45.161
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

564
00:13:45.161 --> 00:13:45.250
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

565
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:45.520
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

566
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.630
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mean literally.</v>

567
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.060
<v Speaker 2>I just mean like if Milo plays it up,</v>

568
00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:51.070
<v Speaker 2>like I'm going to shame people until they don't work out,</v>

569
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:51.930
<v Speaker 2>why would you?</v>

570
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:52.090
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

571
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 2>but I'll say this,</v>

572
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.320
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

573
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.070
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

574
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.550
<v Speaker 2>Milo can can say the nasty things and be the kind of person is he shouldn't have</v>

575
00:13:57.551 --> 00:13:58.121
<v Speaker 2>been banned from twitter.</v>

576
00:13:58.121 --> 00:13:58.954
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

577
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.060
<v Speaker 2>Why was this verification badge removed?</v>

578
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.290
<v Speaker 2>That was another.</v>

579
00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:02.550
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

580
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.790
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

581
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:03.490
<v Speaker 2>it's plain as day.</v>

582
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:04.960
<v Speaker 2>The verification one was weird.</v>

583
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're going to keep you here,</v>

584
00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to take away the verification lets people know you're you.</v>

585
00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

586
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.340
<v Speaker 2>So it opens the door to fraud.</v>

587
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:13.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

588
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.570
<v Speaker 2>And it opens the door to fake my lows and you don't know who's who because</v>

589
00:14:16.571 --> 00:14:19.840
<v Speaker 2>there's no blue checkmark that doesn't necessarily make any sense.</v>

590
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.560
<v Speaker 2>And then we get to Julian assange who couldn't get verified what?</v>

591
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

592
00:14:24.851 --> 00:14:25.380
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't have.</v>

593
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.280
<v Speaker 2>And so a bunch of fake accounts started popping up.</v>

594
00:14:27.281 --> 00:14:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>

595
00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.410
<v Speaker 2>We verified Wiki.</v>

596
00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:31.510
<v Speaker 2>I believe wikileaks is but.</v>

597
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.890
<v Speaker 2>And then I think Julian assange his account was changed into the defendant's</v>

598
00:14:34.891 --> 00:14:35.724
<v Speaker 2>Anja count,</v>

599
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:36.730
<v Speaker 2>but it's not verified,</v>

600
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.230
<v Speaker 2>at least I'm pretty sure.</v>

601
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.570
<v Speaker 2>What was the reasoning behind not verifying Juliana such?</v>

602
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there was one.</v>

603
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:43.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

604
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Can we do.</v>

605
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a little sidebar here.</v>

606
00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

607
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Can you tell me what's wrong with Julian assange's?</v>

608
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:47.891
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

609
00:14:47.891 --> 00:14:52.610
<v Speaker 2>What is the idea that this guy is some,</v>

610
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:53.840
<v Speaker 2>some super villain,</v>

611
00:14:53.841 --> 00:14:56.780
<v Speaker 2>some bad person that did something terrible because the exposed some</v>

612
00:14:56.781 --> 00:14:57.441
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

613
00:14:57.441 --> 00:14:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Like what am I missing?</v>

614
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.960
<v Speaker 2>I guess it depends on how conspiratorial you want to get,</v>

615
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:04.460
<v Speaker 2>but joining a sign they,</v>

616
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.790
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

617
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.760
<v Speaker 2>they've labeled him like the intelligence agencies and I think that may have</v>

618
00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:08.594
<v Speaker 2>been James Clapper,</v>

619
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.310
<v Speaker 2>sad that he is acting as a private intelligence adversary of the US or something</v>

620
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:14.144
<v Speaker 2>to that effect.</v>

621
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.740
<v Speaker 2>So of Russia,</v>

622
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:19.570
<v Speaker 2>you mean know that Julian assange just acting independently against the US</v>

623
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.473
<v Speaker 2>against it.</v>

624
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:20.901
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

625
00:15:20.901 --> 00:15:21.021
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

626
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:21.260
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

627
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.950
<v Speaker 2>And so that the leaks put out very damaging to the US.</v>

628
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.120
<v Speaker 2>I think that's fair to say.</v>

629
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

630
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.833
<v Speaker 2>They don't like them.</v>

631
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

632
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:29.143
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

633
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.670
<v Speaker 2>then he ends up getting accused of,</v>

634
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:31.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

635
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I believe molestation.</v>

636
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm a year.</v>

637
00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:35.800
<v Speaker 2>It was secrets.</v>

638
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.340
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

639
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:38.640
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

640
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.590
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty complicated.</v>

641
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.290
<v Speaker 2>He was having consensual sex with a woman.</v>

642
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.190
<v Speaker 2>The content then?</v>

643
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:43.461
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

644
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:43.581
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

645
00:15:43.581 --> 00:15:43.761
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

646
00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:44.421
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

647
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:46.520
<v Speaker 2>I think while they were in the bed,</v>

648
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.340
<v Speaker 2>then the accusation was that he without a condom on,</v>

649
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.800
<v Speaker 2>he had sex with her again.</v>

650
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:53.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's,</v>

651
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

652
00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:54.600
<v Speaker 2>I'll be honest,</v>

653
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.041
<v Speaker 2>been years,</v>

654
00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:56.030
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's the case.</v>

655
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I thought that there is a,</v>

656
00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:58.873
<v Speaker 2>I'll say this,</v>

657
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.591
<v Speaker 2>it's been years,</v>

658
00:16:00.591 --> 00:16:00.830
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

659
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:01.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

660
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 2>but there was reference to a condom breaking and I think what happened was he</v>

661
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:06.170
<v Speaker 2>said it was fine or something,</v>

662
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.141
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

663
00:16:07.141 --> 00:16:07.551
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

664
00:16:07.551 --> 00:16:08.270
<v Speaker 2>outside of that,</v>

665
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:08.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

666
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.340
<v Speaker 2>the guy has been locked up for how long,</v>

667
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:10.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

668
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:11.330
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

669
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.750
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the UN said something like it's a violation of human rights or</v>

670
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:15.171
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

671
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:15.550
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

672
00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.101
<v Speaker 2>we went over,</v>

673
00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:16.460
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

674
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:16.791
<v Speaker 2>what is it,</v>

675
00:16:16.791 --> 00:16:20.120
<v Speaker 2>six years if he's been locked up for more than six years.</v>

676
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:20.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

677
00:16:20.321 --> 00:16:23.930
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy and it's because there's an a man.</v>

678
00:16:23.931 --> 00:16:25.510
<v Speaker 2>This is getting a little bit out of my wheelhouse,</v>

679
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.850
<v Speaker 2>but I think the US has preparing a grand jury indictment against him.</v>

680
00:16:28.851 --> 00:16:29.684
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

681
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:30.610
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

682
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

683
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:35.840
<v Speaker 2>and Chelsea manning who gave him the information is now free and out of jail.</v>

684
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:36.490
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

685
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:36.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

686
00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:38.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it's presumed that Chelsea did.</v>

687
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.070
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was,</v>

688
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:40.450
<v Speaker 2>maybe it,</v>

689
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.283
<v Speaker 2>maybe it is.</v>

690
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.810
<v Speaker 2>It's been years since I've tracked a lot of this stuff.</v>

691
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

692
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.300
<v Speaker 2>But back to the main point,</v>

693
00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:48.620
<v Speaker 2>back to the essential wasn't verified,</v>

694
00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:48.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

695
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:49.790
<v Speaker 2>Wiki leaks was,</v>

696
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:50.271
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure.</v>

697
00:16:50.271 --> 00:16:50.451
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

698
00:16:50.451 --> 00:16:53.120
<v Speaker 2>so verification is not just,</v>

699
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:53.541
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

700
00:16:53.541 --> 00:16:54.620
<v Speaker 2>this is tim pool.</v>

701
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:55.910
<v Speaker 2>There's Jamie Vernon.</v>

702
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:56.271
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

703
00:16:56.271 --> 00:16:56.590
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

704
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:57.440
<v Speaker 2>that's the real Jamie.</v>

705
00:16:57.441 --> 00:16:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Give him a blue check mark.</v>

706
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.290
<v Speaker 2>It's a we don't like you,</v>

707
00:17:00.291 --> 00:17:03.110
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to take away your check mark even though we know you're the real</v>

708
00:17:03.111 --> 00:17:03.610
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

709
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:03.870
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

710
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:04.611
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>

711
00:17:04.611 --> 00:17:05.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a class.</v>

712
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.160
<v Speaker 2>It's an elite class of people.</v>

713
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.960
<v Speaker 2>A removal of approval.</v>

714
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

715
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.860
<v Speaker 2>There are some people who I think have removed their own verification badges.</v>

716
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.920
<v Speaker 2>You can just change your name and it erases.</v>

717
00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:19.340
<v Speaker 2>I think Pewdie Pie did it once and then immediately.</v>

718
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:19.821
<v Speaker 2>Immediately.</v>

719
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:20.654
<v Speaker 2>Got It back.</v>

720
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

721
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:21.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

722
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:22.140
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

723
00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

724
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:22.700
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

725
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

726
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.070
<v Speaker 2>but you know why?</v>

727
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.300
<v Speaker 2>Why moved someone's verification?</v>

728
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

729
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.501
<v Speaker 2>What does that,</v>

730
00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:28.030
<v Speaker 2>what does that do?</v>

731
00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:28.210
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

732
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:29.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm 100 percent agreement.</v>

733
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.740
<v Speaker 2>So what.</v>

734
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:31.551
<v Speaker 2>So another,</v>

735
00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:35.420
<v Speaker 2>another interesting thing we can sort of segway into is why was a Laura loomer</v>

736
00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:36.254
<v Speaker 2>band?</v>

737
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:38.030
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be a fan of Laura loomer.</v>

738
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:38.720
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

739
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.980
<v Speaker 2>you can question her politics.</v>

740
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Was she a band before,</v>

741
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.270
<v Speaker 2>after she jumped Nancy Pelosi's fence before,</v>

742
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:45.610
<v Speaker 2>but she's,</v>

743
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:45.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

744
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:46.663
<v Speaker 2>I'll say this man,</v>

745
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:47.420
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

746
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.830
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted about it if,</v>

747
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 2>oh God talking about</v>

748
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 3>twitter,</v>

749
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.383
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

750
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.470
<v Speaker 3>even if you don't like her,</v>

751
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.630
<v Speaker 3>you got to admit she knows how to get press.</v>

752
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.170
<v Speaker 3>She knows how to generate that buzz and then she's really good at it.</v>

753
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.390
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>

754
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.223
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>

755
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.110
<v Speaker 3>she got banned permanently because she tweeted to,</v>

756
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.020
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was Ilan,</v>

757
00:18:04.021 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Omar criticism about Sharia law.</v>

758
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.620
<v Speaker 3>She accused A.</v>

759
00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:08.880
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>

760
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.121
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

761
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:09.721
<v Speaker 3>you could pull up the tweet,</v>

762
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:13.890
<v Speaker 3>but I think she accused Elan of promoting sharia,</v>

763
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.890
<v Speaker 3>which results in like all these horrific things and they banned there for it.</v>

764
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

765
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.050
<v Speaker 3>Disagree with all you want.</v>

766
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:20.550
<v Speaker 3>But that was her criticizing a politician.</v>

767
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.000
<v Speaker 3>You can't have a lawsuit against John Donald trump claiming you can't,</v>

768
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:24.923
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

769
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.450
<v Speaker 3>trump can't block somebody because it's a public forum.</v>

770
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.340
<v Speaker 3>But then when it comes to a congressperson,</v>

771
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.700
<v Speaker 3>public just permanently banned someone for saying something critical of their</v>

772
00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:33.390
<v Speaker 3>ideology.</v>

773
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:38.390
<v Speaker 3>And I think what's really critical here is that there has to be some sort of</v>

774
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:44.310
<v Speaker 3>clarification for what policies were violated and how they were violated like</v>

775
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.250
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

776
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:45.991
<v Speaker 3>That seems to be,</v>

777
00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:50.991
<v Speaker 3>especially for public figures because it's one thing if we don't know a person</v>

778
00:18:51.571 --> 00:18:52.231
<v Speaker 3>or the background,</v>

779
00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:53.250
<v Speaker 3>but when you know a person,</v>

780
00:18:53.251 --> 00:18:56.970
<v Speaker 3>when there's a Laura loomer or Milo Yiannopoulos and it's a public case,</v>

781
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:02.300
<v Speaker 3>and then you get this feeling that they say no because we decide and this is it.</v>

782
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.330
<v Speaker 3>Well Joe,</v>

783
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.640
<v Speaker 3>don't worry because no matter what twitter does,</v>

784
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.510
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be defended by the New York digital,</v>

785
00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

786
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:10.801
<v Speaker 3>journalists,</v>

787
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:15.801
<v Speaker 3>elites who will misrepresent what's going on in an effort to obfuscate or</v>

788
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.330
<v Speaker 3>sometimes outright lie about what's going on.</v>

789
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.010
<v Speaker 3>And this brings me to learn to code,</v>

790
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.291
<v Speaker 3>learn to code.</v>

791
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:25.650
<v Speaker 3>So asked you about this the other day that people are getting banned for learn</v>

792
00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:25.981
<v Speaker 3>to code.</v>

793
00:19:25.981 --> 00:19:26.161
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

794
00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:27.630
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is that?</v>

795
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.350
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

796
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.130
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

797
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.800
<v Speaker 3>So when coal miners were getting laid off,</v>

798
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.250
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of articles emerged saying teaching minor state code,</v>

799
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.080
<v Speaker 3>can we teach miners how to code?</v>

800
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.190
<v Speaker 3>And they were showing videos about it,</v>

801
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe it was.</v>

802
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.510
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't intended to be a derogatory or insulting,</v>

803
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.930
<v Speaker 3>but to a lot of people that came off as this bourgeois let them eat cake.</v>

804
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:46.501
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

805
00:19:46.501 --> 00:19:47.940
<v Speaker 3>your career has been destroyed.</v>

806
00:19:47.941 --> 00:19:48.110
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

807
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.380
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

808
00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.010
<v Speaker 3>you're a 50 year old man with a family.</v>

809
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.010
<v Speaker 3>Go to Silicon Valley and do something you've never even thought about.</v>

810
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:53.610
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

811
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.090
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>

812
00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.580
<v Speaker 3>So it came off as to a lot of people as just elitist,</v>

813
00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:57.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

814
00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.830
<v Speaker 3>So when these journalists are getting laid off,</v>

815
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.420
<v Speaker 3>this meme spreads,</v>

816
00:20:00.421 --> 00:20:01.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly where it started,</v>

817
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

818
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.203
<v Speaker 3>where they say,</v>

819
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.740
<v Speaker 3>learn to code to the journalists.</v>

820
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:05.491
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

821
00:20:05.491 --> 00:20:07.290
<v Speaker 3>this is an interesting thing happens.</v>

822
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.113
<v Speaker 3>John Levine,</v>

823
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.920
<v Speaker 3>I think his name from the rap tweets.</v>

824
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.320
<v Speaker 3>Someone from twitter told me you will,</v>

825
00:20:13.321 --> 00:20:13.710
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

826
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 3>you can be banned for tweeting.</v>

827
00:20:15.121 --> 00:20:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Learn to code at a laid off journalists conservative.</v>

828
00:20:17.971 --> 00:20:18.990
<v Speaker 3>Start tweeting it far and wide.</v>

829
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.230
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

830
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.681
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>

831
00:20:19.681 --> 00:20:21.570
<v Speaker 3>This is a reporter from the rap was confirmed this.</v>

832
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.000
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden then other journalists come out and say,</v>

833
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:24.863
<v Speaker 3>this is a lie.</v>

834
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:25.651
<v Speaker 3>This is not true.</v>

835
00:20:25.651 --> 00:20:26.490
<v Speaker 3>This is fake news.</v>

836
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.020
<v Speaker 3>Conservatives are spreading fake news.</v>

837
00:20:28.021 --> 00:20:28.830
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

838
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:29.341
<v Speaker 3>and they say,</v>

839
00:20:29.341 --> 00:20:30.060
<v Speaker 3>we have a new,</v>

840
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.320
<v Speaker 3>a new statement from twitter that said,</v>

841
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.213
<v Speaker 3>we're only,</v>

842
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.100
<v Speaker 3>we're only banning people who are engaging in a harassment campaign.</v>

843
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:40.320
<v Speaker 3>When I got a few problems is tweeting a meme at somebody's critical of them a</v>

844
00:20:40.321 --> 00:20:41.220
<v Speaker 3>harassment campaign?</v>

845
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.440
<v Speaker 3>Is that a meme it.</v>

846
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:42.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

847
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:43.250
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

848
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like it condenses an idea.</v>

849
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:46.403
<v Speaker 3>So here's the thing.</v>

850
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.830
<v Speaker 3>I sent a bunch of screenshots,</v>

851
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:48.970
<v Speaker 3>screenshots from people.</v>

852
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:50.680
<v Speaker 3>Now people can fake screenshots.</v>

853
00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:51.514
<v Speaker 3>I understand that,</v>

854
00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.230
<v Speaker 3>but I checked some people's twitter accounts.</v>

855
00:20:53.231 --> 00:20:55.540
<v Speaker 3>I saw that they were tweeting this and I believe for the most part,</v>

856
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:56.403
<v Speaker 3>this is what happened.</v>

857
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:58.630
<v Speaker 3>Someone tweeted something to a buzzfeed journalists,</v>

858
00:20:59.040 --> 00:20:59.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

859
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.681
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

860
00:20:59.681 --> 00:21:00.850
<v Speaker 3>you guys believed x,</v>

861
00:21:00.851 --> 00:21:01.001
<v Speaker 3>y,</v>

862
00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:01.391
<v Speaker 3>and Z.</v>

863
00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:01.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

864
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:01.990
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

865
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.980
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag learned to code,</v>

866
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.293
<v Speaker 3>criticizing them,</v>

867
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.553
<v Speaker 3>suspension.</v>

868
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:06.490
<v Speaker 3>So then these,</v>

869
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:07.720
<v Speaker 3>these journalists come out and say,</v>

870
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.890
<v Speaker 3>this is not true.</v>

871
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 3>It's just people engaging in harassment campaigns.</v>

872
00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:11.021
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>

873
00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:11.860
<v Speaker 3>look at this guy's account.</v>

874
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.110
<v Speaker 3>He's got one tweet that says learn to code.</v>

875
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.550
<v Speaker 3>Is that him harassing somebody?</v>

876
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.630
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

877
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.871
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

878
00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:18.070
<v Speaker 3>but you're taken out of context.</v>

879
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.140
<v Speaker 3>Then John Levine from the rep says,</v>

880
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.730
<v Speaker 3>update twitter spokesperson,</v>

881
00:21:21.731 --> 00:21:26.290
<v Speaker 3>who was my source is now saying clarifying it is about the harassment campaign,</v>

882
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.320
<v Speaker 3>and then another journalist comes out and says he his quotes,</v>

883
00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:29.831
<v Speaker 3>fake twitter,</v>

884
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:30.700
<v Speaker 3>deny ever saying it,</v>

885
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.833
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing,</v>

886
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.850
<v Speaker 3>the editor and chief of the daily caller,</v>

887
00:21:33.851 --> 00:21:34.350
<v Speaker 3>just a couple of,</v>

888
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:35.230
<v Speaker 3>I think couple of days ago,</v>

889
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.910
<v Speaker 3>took a tweet from the daily show and he,</v>

890
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.310
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

891
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.610
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

892
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:39.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

893
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.470
<v Speaker 3>from the state of the Union and he tweeted,</v>

894
00:21:41.471 --> 00:21:44.050
<v Speaker 3>learn to code and quote tweeted a video suspended.</v>

895
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.870
<v Speaker 3>So it's very clearly not about harassment campaign,</v>

896
00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:50.980
<v Speaker 3>but why then were all of these journalists so ready to jump up and defend</v>

897
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.480
<v Speaker 3>twitter when twitter.</v>

898
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.070
<v Speaker 3>You know what I said?</v>

899
00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:54.761
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

900
00:21:54.761 --> 00:21:57.460
<v Speaker 3>If twitter is claiming they're banning people who are engaging in harassment</v>

901
00:21:57.461 --> 00:21:58.000
<v Speaker 3>campaign you,</v>

902
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.160
<v Speaker 3>you mean they've confirmed they're banning people for tweeting,</v>

903
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.023
<v Speaker 3>learn to code.</v>

904
00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.410
<v Speaker 3>They just consider it harassment.</v>

905
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.810
<v Speaker 3>How is it that learned to code as harassment?</v>

906
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.110
<v Speaker 3>But Kathy Griffin saying to all of our millions of fans,</v>

907
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.590
<v Speaker 3>I want these kids names several times or another verified account.</v>

908
00:22:11.591 --> 00:22:13.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna name because not as famous,</v>

909
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.450
<v Speaker 3>literally calling for the death of these kids and instructing people to kill</v>

910
00:22:16.451 --> 00:22:18.220
<v Speaker 3>them is not a bountiful offense.</v>

911
00:22:18.221 --> 00:22:19.300
<v Speaker 3>It's not harassment campaigns.</v>

912
00:22:19.301 --> 00:22:19.990
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

913
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.461
<v Speaker 3>That uh,</v>

914
00:22:20.461 --> 00:22:21.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't wanna I don't wanna mention the guy's name.</v>

915
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:22.540
<v Speaker 3>I mentioned the name,</v>

916
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:22.871
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>

917
00:22:22.871 --> 00:22:23.560
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

918
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.020
<v Speaker 3>He said something to the effect of put them in a school,</v>

919
00:22:26.021 --> 00:22:26.950
<v Speaker 3>lock it and burn it down.</v>

920
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.630
<v Speaker 3>And when you see them fire on them,</v>

921
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.490
<v Speaker 3>this guy is still active on twitter,</v>

922
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:31.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

923
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.460
<v Speaker 3>you know right now there are anti.</v>

924
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:34.680
<v Speaker 3>So now we can.</v>

925
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.760
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

926
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.370
<v Speaker 3>there's so much here,</v>

927
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:36.710
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

928
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:37.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

929
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.170
<v Speaker 3>we've got the proud boys.</v>

930
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:39.430
<v Speaker 3>All of them purged from twitter.</v>

931
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:40.893
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

932
00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:42.490
<v Speaker 3>Say whatever you want about the proud boys.</v>

933
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.780
<v Speaker 3>If they deserve to be banned,</v>

934
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:44.643
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

935
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Why wasn't Antifa Bend?</v>

936
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.500
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people respond to me and say,</v>

937
00:22:47.501 --> 00:22:49.600
<v Speaker 3>but Tim Antifa is random people who were masked.</v>

938
00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:49.880
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>

939
00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.590
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>

940
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.370
<v Speaker 3>There are branded cells of Antifa that have their own merchandise still active.</v>

941
00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Some of these groups have published the private information of law enforcement</v>

942
00:22:57.851 --> 00:22:58.390
<v Speaker 3>officers.</v>

943
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:59.290
<v Speaker 3>Still active.</v>

944
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.030
<v Speaker 3>No action taken against them.</v>

945
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.370
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

946
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't know this,</v>

947
00:23:04.361 --> 00:23:07.360
<v Speaker 3>this indicates a heavy left wing bias.</v>

948
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.190
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't necessarily say wing,</v>

949
00:23:09.191 --> 00:23:12.720
<v Speaker 3>I would say intersectional identity.</v>

950
00:23:12.721 --> 00:23:14.650
<v Speaker 3>Marion ideological bias,</v>

951
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.633
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

952
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:15.870
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

953
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.051
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

954
00:23:16.051 --> 00:23:16.360
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

955
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.600
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to pinpoint what the tribes are in the culture war,</v>

956
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.040
<v Speaker 3>but twitter is clearly acting in defense of intersectional activism.</v>

957
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.760
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

958
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.860
<v Speaker 3>do you think that this is a mandate?</v>

959
00:23:26.861 --> 00:23:28.510
<v Speaker 3>Do you think this is written somewhere?</v>

960
00:23:28.511 --> 00:23:31.600
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there's people who are in the company that have power,</v>

961
00:23:31.601 --> 00:23:33.250
<v Speaker 3>that are acting independently?</v>

962
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.820
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

963
00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.100
<v Speaker 3>it's a grains of sand to make a heap,</v>

964
00:23:36.101 --> 00:23:36.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

965
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:37.000
<v Speaker 3>You're in,</v>

966
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.990
<v Speaker 3>you're in silicon valley,</v>

967
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.490
<v Speaker 3>you're in a very blue area.</v>

968
00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.480
<v Speaker 3>The people who get hired tend to hold certain views and because they all live in</v>

969
00:23:43.481 --> 00:23:44.230
<v Speaker 3>their own bubble,</v>

970
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:48.530
<v Speaker 3>they believed the majority and thus they think they're acting justly to band</v>

971
00:23:48.531 --> 00:23:49.760
<v Speaker 3>those who are at odds with them.</v>

972
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.350
<v Speaker 3>And this initial engineering,</v>

973
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.780
<v Speaker 3>and this brings back into journalism,</v>

974
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:54.560
<v Speaker 3>the big problem,</v>

975
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:54.950
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

976
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:55.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

977
00:23:55.311 --> 00:23:56.870
<v Speaker 3>for decades,</v>

978
00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how long journalism has been dominated by self identified liberals.</v>

979
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.300
<v Speaker 3>There's a ton of polls.</v>

980
00:24:02.301 --> 00:24:05.840
<v Speaker 3>I think it was about 2015 poll showing Republicans are like seven percent of</v>

981
00:24:05.841 --> 00:24:08.810
<v Speaker 3>journalists or some ridiculously small number and it's a really simple reason</v>

982
00:24:08.811 --> 00:24:09.440
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>

983
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.450
<v Speaker 3>News organizations are headquartered in big cities.</v>

984
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:12.280
<v Speaker 3>The big ones,</v>

985
00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:12.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

986
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.060
<v Speaker 3>seeing even Fox News is in New York,</v>

987
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.130
<v Speaker 3>so there's a lot of people who work at Fox News.</v>

988
00:24:16.131 --> 00:24:16.964
<v Speaker 3>We're actually liberal.</v>

989
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.040
<v Speaker 3>People don't seem to know that you live in New York,</v>

990
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.900
<v Speaker 3>you're probably not a staunch conservative.</v>

991
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.340
<v Speaker 3>So what happens then?</v>

992
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.720
<v Speaker 3>News breaks.</v>

993
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.460
<v Speaker 3>You've got all these journalists because I've worked with them,</v>

994
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:25.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

995
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:26.361
<v Speaker 3>I worked for vice,</v>

996
00:24:26.361 --> 00:24:28.460
<v Speaker 3>I worked for fusion and they sit around at tables,</v>

997
00:24:28.461 --> 00:24:32.450
<v Speaker 3>they meet up after work from different offices and they talk about things and</v>

998
00:24:32.451 --> 00:24:33.920
<v Speaker 3>they all tell each other the exact same thing.</v>

999
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.110
<v Speaker 3>And so this is why you see Covington happen.</v>

1000
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.120
<v Speaker 3>These people will follow each other on twitter.</v>

1001
00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.350
<v Speaker 3>So when someone tweets this Maga kid got in the face of Nathan Phillips,</v>

1002
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.440
<v Speaker 3>they only see each other's tweets and they just write it.</v>

1003
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:46.640
<v Speaker 3>They don't do any journalism.</v>

1004
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:48.103
<v Speaker 3>And it goes it,</v>

1005
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:48.470
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1006
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe for days.</v>

1007
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.960
<v Speaker 3>And that was even in the New York Times,</v>

1008
00:24:50.961 --> 00:24:51.350
<v Speaker 3>correct?</v>

1009
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1010
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.280
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1011
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.080
<v Speaker 3>The New York Times a Harris talked about.</v>

1012
00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.040
<v Speaker 3>It's mind blowing to me because the second video that came out from Covington,</v>

1013
00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.160
<v Speaker 3>you literally watch Nathan Phillips Walk into up to the kid and get his face</v>

1014
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:02.203
<v Speaker 3>Bill Maher,</v>

1015
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:02.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1016
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.781
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1017
00:25:02.781 --> 00:25:03.950
<v Speaker 3>Four or five days later it says,</v>

1018
00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:05.270
<v Speaker 3>the kid got in his face and I'm like,</v>

1019
00:25:05.271 --> 00:25:06.104
<v Speaker 3>how are you?</v>

1020
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.233
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1021
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:08.860
<v Speaker 3>shame on Bill Maher for,</v>

1022
00:25:08.861 --> 00:25:09.080
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1023
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.580
<v Speaker 3>for saying that that's not true.</v>

1024
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:14.630
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time we have a series of journalism problem and this links back</v>

1025
00:25:14.631 --> 00:25:15.464
<v Speaker 3>to twitter and,</v>

1026
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.040
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

1027
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:21.040
<v Speaker 3>that story in particular release almost like condensed all of the problems into</v>

1028
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:23.630
<v Speaker 3>one yet yet.</v>

1029
00:25:23.631 --> 00:25:23.901
<v Speaker 3>And what's,</v>

1030
00:25:23.901 --> 00:25:24.141
<v Speaker 3>what's.</v>

1031
00:25:24.141 --> 00:25:26.090
<v Speaker 3>What's fascinating is following the story,</v>

1032
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:27.111
<v Speaker 3>an op Ed,</v>

1033
00:25:27.111 --> 00:25:28.610
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was in New York Times said,</v>

1034
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.750
<v Speaker 3>stop tweeting arts.</v>

1035
00:25:29.751 --> 00:25:32.390
<v Speaker 3>Had never tweet Brian stelter from CNN.</v>

1036
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.860
<v Speaker 3>Then got a statement that I always say I believe because I don't have the</v>

1037
00:25:36.861 --> 00:25:37.550
<v Speaker 3>sources pulled up,</v>

1038
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:38.870
<v Speaker 3>but someone from twitter said,</v>

1039
00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:40.730
<v Speaker 3>journalists are the lifeblood of our platform.</v>

1040
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:45.140
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why I think you've got these predominantly New York based</v>

1041
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.460
<v Speaker 3>progressive writers.</v>

1042
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:48.110
<v Speaker 3>They're fresh out of college,</v>

1043
00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:51.680
<v Speaker 3>they get hired for moderate salaries to work in a newsroom,</v>

1044
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.060
<v Speaker 3>sit around each other all day,</v>

1045
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.170
<v Speaker 3>sharing the same ideas,</v>

1046
00:25:54.171 --> 00:25:55.610
<v Speaker 3>not exploring anything outside their bubble.</v>

1047
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.970
<v Speaker 3>And twitter supports them because they're the ones who drive traffic to twitter.</v>

1048
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.470
<v Speaker 3>They keep the conversation going.</v>

1049
00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:01.910
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's where twitter is.</v>

1050
00:26:01.911 --> 00:26:03.950
<v Speaker 3>Bias partly comes from the other,</v>

1051
00:26:03.951 --> 00:26:05.420
<v Speaker 3>is that clearly you're in San Francisco,</v>

1052
00:26:05.421 --> 00:26:06.290
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have,</v>

1053
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1054
00:26:06.601 --> 00:26:06.751
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1055
00:26:06.751 --> 00:26:07.584
<v Speaker 3>your staff,</v>

1056
00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:08.480
<v Speaker 3>the people who are,</v>

1057
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.080
<v Speaker 3>who are running content curation and banning people.</v>

1058
00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.243
<v Speaker 3>They lean left.</v>

1059
00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.380
<v Speaker 3>So why,</v>

1060
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:15.980
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1061
00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.580
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1062
00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Kathy Griffin wasn't banned probably because she's,</v>

1063
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.730
<v Speaker 3>she's very famous,</v>

1064
00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.590
<v Speaker 3>but then I have to wonder why Alex Jones was.</v>

1065
00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:22.761
<v Speaker 3>So the only,</v>

1066
00:26:22.761 --> 00:26:27.500
<v Speaker 3>the only real differentiator there I guess is either mainstream notoriety or</v>

1067
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.120
<v Speaker 3>ideological tribe.</v>

1068
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:30.730
<v Speaker 3>Well Jimmy,</v>

1069
00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.470
<v Speaker 3>you pulled up why Alex was been to,</v>

1070
00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:34.304
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

1071
00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:35.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1072
00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.220
<v Speaker 3>it's not very clear like when,</v>

1073
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.210
<v Speaker 3>when you think about the fact that they were saying that he had never done</v>

1074
00:26:41.211 --> 00:26:42.860
<v Speaker 3>anything on their platform,</v>

1075
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.180
<v Speaker 3>that was bantible.</v>

1076
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:49.890
<v Speaker 2>And then what was the one final thing like and Jack didn't know what he was,</v>

1077
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.780
<v Speaker 2>he got it.</v>

1078
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.140
<v Speaker 2>He confronted Oliver,</v>

1079
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Darcy of CNN in DC and for several minutes was yelling at them while they filmed</v>

1080
00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:00.390
<v Speaker 2>and apparently that's my understanding was the justification for banning him</v>

1081
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:02.130
<v Speaker 2>that he was harassing a journalist or something to that effect,</v>

1082
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.380
<v Speaker 2>which is in my opinion,</v>

1083
00:27:04.381 --> 00:27:04.940
<v Speaker 2>absurd.</v>

1084
00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:05.200
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1085
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.750
<v Speaker 2>and doing it on twitter.</v>

1086
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:07.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1087
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.700
<v Speaker 2>I guess they posted it to twitter live on periscope with their platform.</v>

1088
00:27:11.701 --> 00:27:13.230
<v Speaker 2>So if you do something on periscope,</v>

1089
00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:14.610
<v Speaker 2>they could get you banned from twitter.</v>

1090
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the same thing,</v>

1091
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1092
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.433
<v Speaker 2>Because they're connected.</v>

1093
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1094
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know at what point last.</v>

1095
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.580
<v Speaker 2>I think it was last year,</v>

1096
00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.320
<v Speaker 2>there was like an announcement,</v>

1097
00:27:22.321 --> 00:27:23.370
<v Speaker 2>I saw it on twitch,</v>

1098
00:27:23.371 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 2>but I think it also happened on Youtube.</v>

1099
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.310
<v Speaker 2>They like collectively said,</v>

1100
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:28.110
<v Speaker 2>if you do something on our platform,</v>

1101
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:29.611
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

1102
00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:33.150
<v Speaker 2>if you do something on another platform and we see that you could lose your</v>

1103
00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:34.440
<v Speaker 2>status on our platform to.</v>

1104
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.530
<v Speaker 2>Or if that means public also.</v>

1105
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.060
<v Speaker 2>And we see that with,</v>

1106
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:39.893
<v Speaker 2>with Patrion,</v>

1107
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:41.500
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to deviate into Patriot and yeah,</v>

1108
00:27:41.501 --> 00:27:41.980
<v Speaker 2>we can.</v>

1109
00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.020
<v Speaker 2>We can get to that later.</v>

1110
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:43.950
<v Speaker 2>But so,</v>

1111
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.180
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

1112
00:27:45.181 --> 00:27:46.140
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

1113
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.180
<v Speaker 2>so it's make it makes a good point.</v>

1114
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:52.170
<v Speaker 2>How does Alex Jones get banned for giving that guy a hard time?</v>

1115
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:56.070
<v Speaker 2>But Kathy Griffin doesn't get banned for literally calling for these children.</v>

1116
00:27:56.071 --> 00:27:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Leading a harassment campaign against kids names on.</v>

1117
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Someone with millions of followers led a harassment campaign.</v>

1118
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to use their language,</v>

1119
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:03.031
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1120
00:28:03.031 --> 00:28:05.130
<v Speaker 2>If you're calling on your followers to do something,</v>

1121
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.720
<v Speaker 2>you're engaging in a campaign.</v>

1122
00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:11.660
<v Speaker 2>But Alex Jones confronting the journalist who advocated for his banding is a</v>

1123
00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:12.503
<v Speaker 2>bantible offense.</v>

1124
00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1125
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.100
<v Speaker 2>here's the important thing about Jones.</v>

1126
00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.440
<v Speaker 2>Oliver Darcy said on CNN,</v>

1127
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:21.070
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that Jones broke the rules that got in band because you know what?</v>

1128
00:28:21.071 --> 00:28:23.370
<v Speaker 2>What Darcy said is he's been breaking the rules in the past.</v>

1129
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:23.970
<v Speaker 2>They never cared.</v>

1130
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.860
<v Speaker 2>It was only because of media pressure.</v>

1131
00:28:25.861 --> 00:28:26.820
<v Speaker 2>They took action against him.</v>

1132
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:28.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1133
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.970
<v Speaker 2>well we know many other people break the rules.</v>

1134
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.520
<v Speaker 2>We know followup to accounts have [inaudible] law enforcement.</v>

1135
00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:33.480
<v Speaker 2>We know Kathy Griffin,</v>

1136
00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:34.890
<v Speaker 2>lot of harassment campaign.</v>

1137
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.210
<v Speaker 2>There's no media pressure,</v>

1138
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.380
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the big problems.</v>

1139
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Twitter knows conservatives aren't going to be able to level any kind of</v>

1140
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.140
<v Speaker 2>campaign against their platform.</v>

1141
00:28:43.141 --> 00:28:43.974
<v Speaker 2>There's not scared of it,</v>

1142
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:44.910
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1143
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:45.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1144
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.700
<v Speaker 2>I often wonder why is it that as,</v>

1145
00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:48.210
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

1146
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:51.000
<v Speaker 2>as prominent and powerful as conservative groups can be,</v>

1147
00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.490
<v Speaker 2>why they often lose these cultural battles.</v>

1148
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.160
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not going to say this is the primary reason,</v>

1149
00:28:56.161 --> 00:28:57.000
<v Speaker 2>but I will point out,</v>

1150
00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:58.550
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1151
00:28:58.550 --> 00:28:58.830
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>

1152
00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:00.690
<v Speaker 2>does twitter believe that?</v>

1153
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:01.583
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1154
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:01.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1155
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:03.930
<v Speaker 2>I often use Sargon of Akkad as an example.</v>

1156
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.000
<v Speaker 2>The liberalist anti saw character.</v>

1157
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Do they believe he'll lead a group of liberal liberalists and individualists to</v>

1158
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.540
<v Speaker 2>twitter headquarters with crowbars and Maldef cocktails?</v>

1159
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:13.320
<v Speaker 2>Of course not.</v>

1160
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.230
<v Speaker 2>So what did he get Ben from?</v>

1161
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.553
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1162
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.550
<v Speaker 2>my under I with Patrion.</v>

1163
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.800
<v Speaker 2>But what happens is original twitter thing was that he posted an image of</v>

1164
00:29:22.801 --> 00:29:25.170
<v Speaker 2>interracial gay porn at white nationalists.</v>

1165
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.903
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1166
00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:28.570
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>

1167
00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:29.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1168
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:30.480
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the first time.</v>

1169
00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:31.950
<v Speaker 2>And then he got banned for that.</v>

1170
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:32.440
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1171
00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:32.670
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1172
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:32.821
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1173
00:29:32.821 --> 00:29:32.941
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1174
00:29:32.941 --> 00:29:34.560
<v Speaker 2>then he came back to the platform and then got,</v>

1175
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:35.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1176
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:36.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened the second time.</v>

1177
00:29:36.091 --> 00:29:37.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it was banned invasion or something,</v>

1178
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.350
<v Speaker 2>the porn rules because sometimes I'll be scrolling through my feed and you'll</v>

1179
00:29:41.351 --> 00:29:42.184
<v Speaker 2>just see porn.</v>

1180
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:42.821
<v Speaker 2>I understand it.</v>

1181
00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:43.654
<v Speaker 2>It's not allowed.</v>

1182
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.310
<v Speaker 2>I porns is not allowed.</v>

1183
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:45.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1184
00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:46.740
<v Speaker 2>what about porn star?</v>

1185
00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.440
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1186
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:47.951
<v Speaker 2>I've heard it.</v>

1187
00:29:47.951 --> 00:29:49.300
<v Speaker 2>I've heard it is a lot and I've heard it isn't.</v>

1188
00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:50.680
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely there.</v>

1189
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1190
00:29:50.941 --> 00:29:51.131
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1191
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1192
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.200
<v Speaker 2>So like porn stars have porn.</v>

1193
00:29:53.201 --> 00:29:55.060
<v Speaker 2>If you go to a porn stars page,</v>

1194
00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.170
<v Speaker 2>you'll see porn on it.</v>

1195
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.860
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it.</v>

1196
00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1197
00:29:57.131 --> 00:29:58.750
<v Speaker 2>like real penetration.</v>

1198
00:29:58.751 --> 00:29:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Porn,</v>

1199
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.333
<v Speaker 2>they don't care.</v>

1200
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe there's truths to get marked by someone is saying this is inappropriate</v>

1201
00:30:05.531 --> 00:30:07.360
<v Speaker 2>and if enough people that follow a porn star,</v>

1202
00:30:07.361 --> 00:30:08.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's inappropriate.</v>

1203
00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:10.240
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't then get flagged in the system.</v>

1204
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Well that's good news.</v>

1205
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.780
<v Speaker 2>I think we may have found the,</v>

1206
00:30:13.781 --> 00:30:14.051
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1207
00:30:14.051 --> 00:30:16.030
<v Speaker 2>the Switzerland of the culture war porn.</v>

1208
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:16.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1209
00:30:16.391 --> 00:30:17.680
<v Speaker 2>No one wants to ban porn.</v>

1210
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.390
<v Speaker 2>The left and the right.</v>

1211
00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:19.601
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1212
00:30:19.601 --> 00:30:19.731
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

1213
00:30:19.731 --> 00:30:19.821
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1214
00:30:19.821 --> 00:30:19.871
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1215
00:30:19.871 --> 00:30:20.141
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>

1216
00:30:20.141 --> 00:30:20.974
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

1217
00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:22.630
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>

1218
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:24.070
<v Speaker 2>We can bend them for their ideas.</v>

1219
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:25.450
<v Speaker 2>We just leave the porn alone.</v>

1220
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1221
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:26.351
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1222
00:30:26.351 --> 00:30:27.131
<v Speaker 2>but the point I was making,</v>

1223
00:30:27.131 --> 00:30:28.990
<v Speaker 2>as you see Antifa at Berkeley.</v>

1224
00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1225
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:30.940
<v Speaker 2>$100,000 worth of damage,</v>

1226
00:30:30.941 --> 00:30:31.960
<v Speaker 2>throwing Molotov cocktails,</v>

1227
00:30:31.961 --> 00:30:33.380
<v Speaker 2>threatening people in,</v>

1228
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:33.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1229
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.221
<v Speaker 2>in Portland.</v>

1230
00:30:34.221 --> 00:30:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Do you had a Bernie voter carrying an American flag?</v>

1231
00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.530
<v Speaker 2>These antifascist,</v>

1232
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.090
<v Speaker 2>the Antifa tried stealing the flack from them,</v>

1233
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:40.871
<v Speaker 2>clubbed them over the head,</v>

1234
00:30:40.871 --> 00:30:41.471
<v Speaker 2>gave him a concussion,</v>

1235
00:30:41.471 --> 00:30:42.304
<v Speaker 2>put them in the hospital.</v>

1236
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:47.080
<v Speaker 2>So when I see the ramifications of fire from the left or the right,</v>

1237
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.670
<v Speaker 2>what does what a conservatives do?</v>

1238
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:52.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean the gop couldn't even find a yearbook in the Virginia Governor Race.</v>

1239
00:30:52.211 --> 00:30:54.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're considered to be that big of a cultural threat.</v>

1240
00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.780
<v Speaker 2>They react to things,</v>

1241
00:30:55.781 --> 00:30:57.520
<v Speaker 2>they get upset about things that are unfair against them,</v>

1242
00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.910
<v Speaker 2>but they don't go through the streets with clubs and bricks and smash windows</v>

1243
00:31:00.911 --> 00:31:03.670
<v Speaker 2>like Antifa and other far leftists to do.</v>

1244
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:04.541
<v Speaker 2>So if they do,</v>

1245
00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:06.100
<v Speaker 2>they're considered racist.</v>

1246
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.350
<v Speaker 2>It's always some sort of a racist mob.</v>

1247
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.000
<v Speaker 2>That was the,</v>

1248
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.480
<v Speaker 2>that's like the label they get put on them,</v>

1249
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:10.931
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1250
00:31:10.931 --> 00:31:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1251
00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.100
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1252
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:12.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1253
00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:15.280
<v Speaker 2>like that was the label that was put on the proud boys almost immediately,</v>

1254
00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:15.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1255
00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.630
<v Speaker 2>That they're white supremacists,</v>

1256
00:31:16.631 --> 00:31:20.410
<v Speaker 2>even though there was people of color that were amongst the ranks and.</v>

1257
00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Well they changed the definition of racist.</v>

1258
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what the whole origin of the proud boys is?</v>

1259
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.950
<v Speaker 2>I do this kind of fucking hilarious.</v>

1260
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1261
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good at Anthony Kumi.</v>

1262
00:31:30.071 --> 00:31:34.430
<v Speaker 2>It told the whole story on this show because it happened with him and,</v>

1263
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.480
<v Speaker 2>and Gavin mcinnes that Gavin mcinnes came up with it because of a guy that</v>

1264
00:31:39.761 --> 00:31:42.310
<v Speaker 2>worked there and they were doing it as a goof.</v>

1265
00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1266
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.440
<v Speaker 2>And then it became a movement and then became like,</v>

1267
00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:45.400
<v Speaker 2>anybody can join it.</v>

1268
00:31:45.401 --> 00:31:46.390
<v Speaker 2>And the people that join,</v>

1269
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:46.601
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1270
00:31:46.601 --> 00:31:51.250
<v Speaker 2>they took it into a radical way and then it became looking to beat up anti fa</v>

1271
00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.060
<v Speaker 2>and it's just like,</v>

1272
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:52.720
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

1273
00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Well Gavin's crossed the line.</v>

1274
00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:54.460
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1275
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:54.820
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1276
00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1277
00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:55.720
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1278
00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.130
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1279
00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:57.280
<v Speaker 2>and I'll point this out for your.</v>

1280
00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.720
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned media matters in a recent,</v>

1281
00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:00.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1282
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:01.540
<v Speaker 2>that you're talking about Alex Jones.</v>

1283
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.370
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't use them as a source for anything.</v>

1284
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a good point.</v>

1285
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:04.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1286
00:32:04.671 --> 00:32:06.480
<v Speaker 2>But it was just clips of Alex talking.</v>

1287
00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.353
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

1288
00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1289
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:08.703
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1290
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:09.570
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1291
00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:12.940
<v Speaker 2>there's a clip going around of Gavin mcinnes where you can hear him saying these</v>

1292
00:32:12.941 --> 00:32:14.200
<v Speaker 2>crazy things and you're like,</v>

1293
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.351
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1294
00:32:14.351 --> 00:32:15.220
<v Speaker 2>he said it right,</v>

1295
00:32:15.221 --> 00:32:17.140
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out some of the clubs you were talking about dogs,</v>

1296
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:18.200
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1297
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:18.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1298
00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.580
<v Speaker 2>you really can take the context out of things and these clips and understand</v>

1299
00:32:21.581 --> 00:32:21.850
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1300
00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:22.070
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1301
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.690
<v Speaker 2>so what happens if I'm,</v>

1302
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:23.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1303
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm even afraid in my videos,</v>

1304
00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:29.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't quote people anymore because people have taken me reading a quote from a</v>

1305
00:32:29.841 --> 00:32:33.070
<v Speaker 2>newspaper and attributed to me simply for reading someone else's quote.</v>

1306
00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:33.641
<v Speaker 2>And they say,</v>

1307
00:32:33.641 --> 00:32:33.731
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1308
00:32:33.731 --> 00:32:34.800
<v Speaker 2>but he said it right.</v>

1309
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:35.291
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1310
00:32:35.291 --> 00:32:37.180
<v Speaker 2>you look at the really,</v>

1311
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Really Funny Instance of Count Dracula.</v>

1312
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1313
00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.840
<v Speaker 2>the guy with the Nazi pug dog is a hilarious story.</v>

1314
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:43.640
<v Speaker 2>And they told him context didn't matter.</v>

1315
00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.380
<v Speaker 2>So when he leaves the courtroom,</v>

1316
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.790
<v Speaker 2>the reporter says,</v>

1317
00:32:46.791 --> 00:32:47.960
<v Speaker 2>you said this phrase,</v>

1318
00:32:47.961 --> 00:32:48.794
<v Speaker 2>which I'm not going to say,</v>

1319
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:49.910
<v Speaker 2>and he says,</v>

1320
00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:50.540
<v Speaker 2>so did you.</v>

1321
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.470
<v Speaker 2>If context doesn't matter,</v>

1322
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:52.570
<v Speaker 2>you should be arrested too.</v>

1323
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1324
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.750
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

1325
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:54.583
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1326
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:55.240
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1327
00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.170
<v Speaker 2>so what ends up happening is these activists groups,</v>

1328
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.300
<v Speaker 2>they take these quotes out of context.</v>

1329
00:32:59.301 --> 00:32:59.461
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1330
00:32:59.461 --> 00:33:02.870
<v Speaker 2>but admittedly I think it's fair to point out a lot of people recognize Gavin,</v>

1331
00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:04.760
<v Speaker 2>if you can assume there are jokes or not,</v>

1332
00:33:04.761 --> 00:33:05.241
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter.</v>

1333
00:33:05.241 --> 00:33:06.320
<v Speaker 2>He said things that were over the,</v>

1334
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.070
<v Speaker 2>over the line.</v>

1335
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.251
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1336
00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Gavin's the main problem,</v>

1337
00:33:08.801 --> 00:33:10.910
<v Speaker 2>the indefensible problem was the call to violence,</v>

1338
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:12.141
<v Speaker 2>the calling,</v>

1339
00:33:12.141 --> 00:33:13.130
<v Speaker 2>calling for violence.</v>

1340
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.510
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think Gavin's like,</v>

1341
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.270
<v Speaker 2>he's another one who's like a prankster.</v>

1342
00:33:17.271 --> 00:33:19.310
<v Speaker 2>He's like a punk rock style prankster.</v>

1343
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:20.960
<v Speaker 2>And he likes to burn it to the ground.</v>

1344
00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:21.320
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1345
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:21.921
<v Speaker 2>And look,</v>

1346
00:33:21.921 --> 00:33:24.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan of Gavin's interviews on youtube where he,</v>

1347
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.580
<v Speaker 2>he'll,</v>

1348
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.210
<v Speaker 2>he hoodwinked people into sitting down and talking to them or I don't even know</v>

1349
00:33:29.211 --> 00:33:30.070
<v Speaker 2>if they're still up anymore.</v>

1350
00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:30.520
<v Speaker 2>But my,</v>

1351
00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:30.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1352
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.330
<v Speaker 2>my understanding of it ruined some chicks life.</v>

1353
00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:33.363
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>

1354
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean this like somewhat figuratively,</v>

1355
00:33:35.181 --> 00:33:35.960
<v Speaker 2>she was a,</v>

1356
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.070
<v Speaker 2>a left wing individual.</v>

1357
00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:38.750
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know who he was.</v>

1358
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.340
<v Speaker 2>He asked her to come on and her friends basically just disavowed her immediately</v>

1359
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:46.250
<v Speaker 2>because she was talking to him because she sounded an unintelligent.</v>

1360
00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:47.241
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1361
00:33:47.241 --> 00:33:48.580
<v Speaker 2>I gotta I gotta I gotTa tell you man,</v>

1362
00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:49.473
<v Speaker 2>he cornered her.</v>

1363
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you have this issue,</v>

1364
00:33:50.841 --> 00:33:53.020
<v Speaker 2>but for the longest time it's,</v>

1365
00:33:53.021 --> 00:33:53.810
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1366
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:58.550
<v Speaker 2>it substantially harder to interview someone on the ideological left than anyone</v>

1367
00:33:58.551 --> 00:33:59.300
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1368
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.133
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1369
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.060
<v Speaker 2>So I recently reached out to,</v>

1370
00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:02.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1371
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:03.640
<v Speaker 2>I regularly reach out to people.</v>

1372
00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:03.861
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1373
00:34:03.861 --> 00:34:05.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to name drop because I don't want to drag people,</v>

1374
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.950
<v Speaker 2>but a man,</v>

1375
00:34:06.951 --> 00:34:10.400
<v Speaker 2>it takes weeks trying to organize a meeting with some of these personalities who</v>

1376
00:34:10.401 --> 00:34:11.890
<v Speaker 2>are progressives and on the left weeks.</v>

1377
00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:13.263
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1378
00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.210
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1379
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:15.500
<v Speaker 2>even even people who,</v>

1380
00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.500
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

1381
00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.570
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten messages from people saying,</v>

1382
00:34:17.571 --> 00:34:17.871
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>

1383
00:34:17.871 --> 00:34:18.740
<v Speaker 2>I watch yourself all the time,</v>

1384
00:34:18.741 --> 00:34:19.191
<v Speaker 2>but hold on,</v>

1385
00:34:19.191 --> 00:34:19.451
<v Speaker 2>let me get,</v>

1386
00:34:19.451 --> 00:34:20.120
<v Speaker 2>let me think about it.</v>

1387
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.260
<v Speaker 2>And talked to some people first.</v>

1388
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying they're doing it because they're skittish or it's just harder.</v>

1389
00:34:25.221 --> 00:34:26.054
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot harder.</v>

1390
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:26.391
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1391
00:34:26.391 --> 00:34:28.100
<v Speaker 2>they're probably more cautious,</v>

1392
00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:29.990
<v Speaker 2>especially if you know your,</v>

1393
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:32.660
<v Speaker 2>where your ideology standards ambiguous.</v>

1394
00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.130
<v Speaker 2>It's trying to figure it out.</v>

1395
00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1396
00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:34.980
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

1397
00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:35.481
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

1398
00:34:35.481 --> 00:34:35.931
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

1399
00:34:35.931 --> 00:34:36.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1400
00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:37.371
<v Speaker 2>a man,</v>

1401
00:34:37.371 --> 00:34:38.400
<v Speaker 2>even even David,</v>

1402
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.290
<v Speaker 2>David Pakman engine,</v>

1403
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:39.770
<v Speaker 2>be Dorky,</v>

1404
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:40.471
<v Speaker 2>get dragged through the.</v>

1405
00:34:40.471 --> 00:34:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I see people on twitter calling them alternate weirdly enough or</v>

1406
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.210
<v Speaker 2>intellectual dark web Jimmy Doors.</v>

1407
00:34:47.211 --> 00:34:48.470
<v Speaker 2>An interesting character.</v>

1408
00:34:48.471 --> 00:34:49.450
<v Speaker 2>I really liked that.</v>

1409
00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1410
00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.650
<v Speaker 2>such an interesting guy.</v>

1411
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:52.940
<v Speaker 2>He's very smart,</v>

1412
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:53.330
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>

1413
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:53.930
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1414
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:55.760
<v Speaker 2>he's an angry lefty,</v>

1415
00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:57.300
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

1416
00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:58.790
<v Speaker 2>but he defends free speech.</v>

1417
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:02.090
<v Speaker 2>He's 100 percent.</v>

1418
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>

1419
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.901
<v Speaker 2>here's my thing,</v>

1420
00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:03.410
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1421
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:04.243
<v Speaker 2>I was in Berkeley,</v>

1422
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:07.700
<v Speaker 2>it was this big protest against Ben Shapiro and there's a guy wearing a mask</v>

1423
00:35:07.701 --> 00:35:08.230
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>

1424
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1425
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:10.220
<v Speaker 2>communist flag full,</v>

1426
00:35:10.221 --> 00:35:11.270
<v Speaker 2>like rent gear.</v>

1427
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:13.280
<v Speaker 2>So I got to interview him and I'm like,</v>

1428
00:35:13.281 --> 00:35:13.910
<v Speaker 2>you mind if I interview him?</v>

1429
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:14.091
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1430
00:35:14.091 --> 00:35:14.211
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1431
00:35:14.211 --> 00:35:14.361
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1432
00:35:14.361 --> 00:35:15.000
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1433
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:15.620
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1434
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:15.881
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

1435
00:35:15.881 --> 00:35:16.011
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1436
00:35:16.011 --> 00:35:16.844
<v Speaker 2>that's surprising.</v>

1437
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.290
<v Speaker 2>And then we start talking and I said,</v>

1438
00:35:18.291 --> 00:35:20.630
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel about these people that dress in all black and you know,</v>

1439
00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:20.890
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1440
00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.670
<v Speaker 2>are fighting people and causing problems.</v>

1441
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:23.061
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1442
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:23.720
<v Speaker 2>that's terrible.</v>

1443
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.290
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1444
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:25.250
<v Speaker 2>you think so really?</v>

1445
00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.240
<v Speaker 2>It's actually,</v>

1446
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:30.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised because often when I see people wearing fully masked up with</v>

1447
00:35:30.111 --> 00:35:30.890
<v Speaker 2>communist stuff,</v>

1448
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:33.260
<v Speaker 2>they're typically in favor of the,</v>

1449
00:35:33.261 --> 00:35:33.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1450
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:36.380
<v Speaker 2>by any means by any means necessary strategies.</v>

1451
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:37.111
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

1452
00:35:37.111 --> 00:35:37.411
<v Speaker 2>no way,</v>

1453
00:35:37.411 --> 00:35:37.621
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1454
00:35:37.621 --> 00:35:38.454
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong.</v>

1455
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:39.061
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm like,</v>

1456
00:35:39.061 --> 00:35:39.301
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1457
00:35:39.301 --> 00:35:39.870
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1458
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:40.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if you're communist,</v>

1459
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if you're whatever,</v>

1460
00:35:42.301 --> 00:35:45.510
<v Speaker 3>as long as not an authoritarian who thinks you have the right to beat other</v>

1461
00:35:45.511 --> 00:35:50.511
<v Speaker 3>people to instill your ideology on them or use manipulative force or coercion or</v>

1462
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:52.170
<v Speaker 3>extortion like.</v>

1463
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.191
<v Speaker 3>So let me,</v>

1464
00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:53.460
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>

1465
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:53.730
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>

1466
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.730
<v Speaker 3>let me talk about why I think what we're seeing with twitter might be one of the</v>

1467
00:35:56.731 --> 00:35:57.564
<v Speaker 3>biggest problems ever.</v>

1468
00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:58.711
<v Speaker 3>Twitter,</v>

1469
00:35:58.711 --> 00:35:59.071
<v Speaker 3>Youtube,</v>

1470
00:35:59.071 --> 00:35:59.401
<v Speaker 3>facebook.</v>

1471
00:35:59.401 --> 00:36:02.460
<v Speaker 3>These platforms are where we exist socially.</v>

1472
00:36:02.461 --> 00:36:03.294
<v Speaker 3>Politically.</v>

1473
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.860
<v Speaker 3>It's where our ideas are exchanged.</v>

1474
00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:07.680
<v Speaker 3>It's where we learn about who we are going to vote for or why we won't vote for</v>

1475
00:36:07.681 --> 00:36:08.514
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>

1476
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:09.510
<v Speaker 3>When you band somebody,</v>

1477
00:36:09.511 --> 00:36:10.230
<v Speaker 3>you exile them,</v>

1478
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:11.910
<v Speaker 3>they're no longer part of that conversation.</v>

1479
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.650
<v Speaker 3>So they're very much so told you are outside the city walls,</v>

1480
00:36:16.651 --> 00:36:16.861
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1481
00:36:16.861 --> 00:36:17.471
<v Speaker 3>You can't come in,</v>

1482
00:36:17.471 --> 00:36:19.050
<v Speaker 3>you can't talk to us and there's nothing you can do about it.</v>

1483
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:22.410
<v Speaker 3>But then when you realize the rules are actually bent,</v>

1484
00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:23.581
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1485
00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:24.930
<v Speaker 3>they're slanted in a certain direction,</v>

1486
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.270
<v Speaker 3>you can then predict where things are going.</v>

1487
00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 3>Did you see the green,</v>

1488
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:28.831
<v Speaker 3>the green,</v>

1489
00:36:28.831 --> 00:36:29.490
<v Speaker 3>new deal?</v>

1490
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:30.570
<v Speaker 3>Alexandria sizer Cortez?</v>

1491
00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:31.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1492
00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:32.180
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>

1493
00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.260
<v Speaker 3>In so she publishes,</v>

1494
00:36:34.261 --> 00:36:35.550
<v Speaker 3>it's a nonbinding resolution,</v>

1495
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.620
<v Speaker 3>which means that even if it passes,</v>

1496
00:36:37.621 --> 00:36:38.730
<v Speaker 3>they can't enforce anything,</v>

1497
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.193
<v Speaker 3>but my God,</v>

1498
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.660
<v Speaker 3>I have the fact sheet.</v>

1499
00:36:42.661 --> 00:36:43.560
<v Speaker 3>They released alongside it,</v>

1500
00:36:43.561 --> 00:36:47.700
<v Speaker 3>literally said they want to provide economic security for people who are</v>

1501
00:36:47.701 --> 00:36:48.720
<v Speaker 3>unwilling to work.</v>

1502
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.513
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1503
00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.210
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1504
00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:52.043
<v Speaker 3>Unwilling.</v>

1505
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:53.483
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1506
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:54.061
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God.</v>

1507
00:36:54.061 --> 00:36:54.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1508
00:36:54.201 --> 00:36:54.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1509
00:36:54.341 --> 00:36:55.650
<v Speaker 3>CNBC reported this.</v>

1510
00:36:55.651 --> 00:36:56.484
<v Speaker 3>They cover this.</v>

1511
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.530
<v Speaker 3>Apparently this got removed from the site.</v>

1512
00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.720
<v Speaker 3>The reason I bring this up is there's a chart from the echo,</v>

1513
00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:03.573
<v Speaker 3>the economist.</v>

1514
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.930
<v Speaker 3>I frequently show this in the content I make where you can see the Conservatives</v>

1515
00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:09.930
<v Speaker 3>are coalescing around a common ideologies.</v>

1516
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.200
<v Speaker 3>For Awhile there was an upset in the party because people didn't like trump,</v>

1517
00:37:13.201 --> 00:37:14.370
<v Speaker 3>but now they've pretty much,</v>

1518
00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:14.641
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1519
00:37:14.641 --> 00:37:15.600
<v Speaker 3>they say it's the party of trump.</v>

1520
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.433
<v Speaker 3>People agree with them.</v>

1521
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:19.260
<v Speaker 3>Ted Cruz even stands and gives him a standing ovation at the state of the union,</v>

1522
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.450
<v Speaker 3>but the left has been spreading out.</v>

1523
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:21.811
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1524
00:37:21.811 --> 00:37:23.820
<v Speaker 3>this is from a chart put together by the economist.</v>

1525
00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.770
<v Speaker 3>The Democrats are very clearly being spread from far left to center and it's</v>

1526
00:37:28.771 --> 00:37:31.560
<v Speaker 3>kind of making it very difficult for the Democrats to,</v>

1527
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:32.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1528
00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:33.690
<v Speaker 3>put forth something that makes sense.</v>

1529
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:35.660
<v Speaker 3>If Alexandria Cortez,</v>

1530
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1531
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:37.260
<v Speaker 3>she puts out the green new deal,</v>

1532
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.020
<v Speaker 3>but in the bill it talks about equity,</v>

1533
00:37:40.021 --> 00:37:40.831
<v Speaker 3>racial justice,</v>

1534
00:37:40.831 --> 00:37:41.700
<v Speaker 3>the gender pay gap,</v>

1535
00:37:41.701 --> 00:37:43.170
<v Speaker 3>things that have nothing to do with the environment.</v>

1536
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.570
<v Speaker 3>And then Nancy Pelosi says it's green dreams,</v>

1537
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.901
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1538
00:37:45.901 --> 00:37:46.201
<v Speaker 3>and she,</v>

1539
00:37:46.201 --> 00:37:47.130
<v Speaker 3>and she derides this.</v>

1540
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.680
<v Speaker 3>You can see that there's a new faction of the Democrats that have,</v>

1541
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:51.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1542
00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.860
<v Speaker 3>holy ideological drive.</v>

1543
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.130
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the reasons for this is what we see on social media,</v>

1544
00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:56.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1545
00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:57.021
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1546
00:37:57.021 --> 00:38:02.021
<v Speaker 3>the ideological bent of the platforms then lead to the mass followings of</v>

1547
00:38:02.131 --> 00:38:06.000
<v Speaker 3>specific individuals who then use specific tactics to get elected.</v>

1548
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:07.163
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

1549
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:07.531
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1550
00:38:07.531 --> 00:38:07.711
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1551
00:38:07.711 --> 00:38:10.680
<v Speaker 3>when these platforms only allow certain ideas to form,</v>

1552
00:38:10.681 --> 00:38:13.710
<v Speaker 3>those ideas will naturally rise to the top of our political space.</v>

1553
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:15.360
<v Speaker 3>And then you get crazy stuff.</v>

1554
00:38:15.361 --> 00:38:16.350
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're unwilling to work,</v>

1555
00:38:16.351 --> 00:38:17.640
<v Speaker 3>we'll provide you economic security,</v>

1556
00:38:17.641 --> 00:38:18.380
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1557
00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:18.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1558
00:38:18.571 --> 00:38:21.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't know necessarily what that means other than some people who choose not</v>

1559
00:38:21.301 --> 00:38:21.511
<v Speaker 3>to work.</v>

1560
00:38:21.511 --> 00:38:22.230
<v Speaker 3>We'll get paid,</v>

1561
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.640
<v Speaker 3>I guess from taxpayer money,</v>

1562
00:38:23.641 --> 00:38:25.860
<v Speaker 3>but that seems completely insane.</v>

1563
00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:26.641
<v Speaker 3>And not only that,</v>

1564
00:38:26.641 --> 00:38:28.500
<v Speaker 3>where's that money coming from from you?</v>

1565
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.590
<v Speaker 3>This is actually what,</v>

1566
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:31.890
<v Speaker 3>another funny thing that.</v>

1567
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:32.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1568
00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1569
00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:33.510
<v Speaker 3>let him know what you mean.</v>

1570
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.901
<v Speaker 3>Literally.</v>

1571
00:38:33.901 --> 00:38:34.734
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1572
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Andrew is Andrew Cuomo.</v>

1573
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:37.441
<v Speaker 3>Sad,</v>

1574
00:38:37.441 --> 00:38:38.680
<v Speaker 3>God forbid if they're rich,</v>

1575
00:38:38.681 --> 00:38:40.750
<v Speaker 3>leave New York because,</v>

1576
00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:41.121
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1577
00:38:41.121 --> 00:38:42.880
<v Speaker 3>I believe one percent of New York,</v>

1578
00:38:42.881 --> 00:38:45.010
<v Speaker 3>the top one percent pay 46 percent of their,</v>

1579
00:38:45.011 --> 00:38:46.330
<v Speaker 3>of their taxes,</v>

1580
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.230
<v Speaker 3>of the revenue they use.</v>

1581
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.170
<v Speaker 3>And so they just had a big budget shortfall,</v>

1582
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:53.320
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was something trump did that caused a shortfall in there.</v>

1583
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.940
<v Speaker 3>And they were asked if they would tax the rich.</v>

1584
00:38:54.941 --> 00:38:55.361
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

1585
00:38:55.361 --> 00:38:55.631
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1586
00:38:55.631 --> 00:38:56.350
<v Speaker 3>God forbid,</v>

1587
00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:56.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1588
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.940
<v Speaker 3>they'll leave and they're already leaving.</v>

1589
00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.650
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>

1590
00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:00.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1591
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:01.690
<v Speaker 3>incoming incoming,</v>

1592
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:03.490
<v Speaker 3>a million people saying I'm conservative for bringing that up.</v>

1593
00:39:03.491 --> 00:39:04.240
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1594
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.290
<v Speaker 3>facts are facts I suppose.</v>

1595
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:05.741
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1596
00:39:05.741 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 3>facts are facts and that's what's really important about this and that when you</v>

1597
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:11.410
<v Speaker 3>suppress any,</v>

1598
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:12.940
<v Speaker 3>any ideology,</v>

1599
00:39:12.941 --> 00:39:14.860
<v Speaker 3>if you are on the left and you suppress the right,</v>

1600
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.460
<v Speaker 3>it is just going to shore up their defenses and they're just going to harden</v>

1601
00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:19.180
<v Speaker 3>their line.</v>

1602
00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.230
<v Speaker 3>That's just how it goes.</v>

1603
00:39:20.231 --> 00:39:21.550
<v Speaker 3>That's how human nature is.</v>

1604
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.230
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell people what to do.</v>

1605
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.393
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

1606
00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:25.660
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

1607
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.250
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1608
00:39:27.251 --> 00:39:28.120
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people might say,</v>

1609
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:31.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little alarmist when I mentioned a potential civil war,</v>

1610
00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:33.010
<v Speaker 3>but let me clarify like I don't.</v>

1611
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying because I've brought this up before,</v>

1612
00:39:34.901 --> 00:39:38.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's going to be like 18 hundreds to big battlefields,</v>

1613
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.611
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time,</v>

1614
00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:42.490
<v Speaker 3>what people don't seem to realize when it comes to history is that when you read</v>

1615
00:39:42.491 --> 00:39:43.430
<v Speaker 3>about World War II,</v>

1616
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.900
<v Speaker 3>we've condensed all the highlights into a very short paragraph or a series of</v>

1617
00:39:46.901 --> 00:39:49.240
<v Speaker 3>paragraphs and you don't realize the war was several years.</v>

1618
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.980
<v Speaker 3>There were periods where nothing happened,</v>

1619
00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:51.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1620
00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.370
<v Speaker 3>I was in Egypt during the second revolution.</v>

1621
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.180
<v Speaker 3>You could look down and you could see Tahrir Square people screaming,</v>

1622
00:39:58.181 --> 00:39:58.751
<v Speaker 3>laser pointers,</v>

1623
00:39:58.751 --> 00:39:59.321
<v Speaker 3>helicopters,</v>

1624
00:39:59.321 --> 00:40:00.154
<v Speaker 3>Apaches,</v>

1625
00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.360
<v Speaker 3>and they announced on the news,</v>

1626
00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:01.960
<v Speaker 3>we just,</v>

1627
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.790
<v Speaker 3>we've deposed the president two blocks away.</v>

1628
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:05.230
<v Speaker 3>A dude's eating a cheeseburger at Mcdonald's,</v>

1629
00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:07.480
<v Speaker 3>watching a football match as if nothing's happening.</v>

1630
00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:09.610
<v Speaker 3>So when you look at these street battles,</v>

1631
00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.570
<v Speaker 3>the political violence,</v>

1632
00:40:10.571 --> 00:40:11.510
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the,</v>

1633
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:11.710
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1634
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:12.880
<v Speaker 3>the biased banning's,</v>

1635
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.140
<v Speaker 3>you look at the dude,</v>

1636
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:18.010
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy who fired a couple of rounds at a police officer in Eugene,</v>

1637
00:40:18.011 --> 00:40:18.391
<v Speaker 3>Oregon,</v>

1638
00:40:18.391 --> 00:40:21.970
<v Speaker 3>and some bombs got planted at the police department or somebody planted bombs at</v>

1639
00:40:21.971 --> 00:40:22.990
<v Speaker 3>a statue in Houston.</v>

1640
00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.980
<v Speaker 3>It starts to feel like there's some kind of political violence that is bubbling</v>

1641
00:40:26.981 --> 00:40:31.150
<v Speaker 3>up that can't be mended at this point when a lot of this comes from the</v>

1642
00:40:31.151 --> 00:40:33.520
<v Speaker 3>suppression that we're talking about where people don't feel like they have a</v>

1643
00:40:33.521 --> 00:40:37.330
<v Speaker 3>voice or that voice is being suppressed by an opposing ideologies.</v>

1644
00:40:37.331 --> 00:40:38.140
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1645
00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:38.973
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1646
00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.390
<v Speaker 3>But it is really complicated and it's,</v>

1647
00:40:40.391 --> 00:40:41.010
<v Speaker 3>it's I,</v>

1648
00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:43.330
<v Speaker 3>I can't claim to know how everything happens,</v>

1649
00:40:43.331 --> 00:40:47.980
<v Speaker 3>but what I will say is I believe social media is responsible for the political</v>

1650
00:40:47.981 --> 00:40:48.521
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>

1651
00:40:48.521 --> 00:40:49.440
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's a,</v>

1652
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:50.620
<v Speaker 3>it's not just about suppression,</v>

1653
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.160
<v Speaker 3>it's you look at the systems that were built facebook,</v>

1654
00:40:55.161 --> 00:40:55.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1655
00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.570
<v Speaker 3>What content can make it to the front page of your facebook posts,</v>

1656
00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.270
<v Speaker 3>your facebook profile when you're looking at your newsfeed while twitter,</v>

1657
00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:04.090
<v Speaker 3>facebook has to build an algorithm to determine what matters.</v>

1658
00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Most companies then figure out how to manipulate that algorithm to get that</v>

1659
00:41:07.871 --> 00:41:08.770
<v Speaker 3>content in front of you.</v>

1660
00:41:08.771 --> 00:41:11.500
<v Speaker 3>Because you know at most you can see what three posts on facebook.</v>

1661
00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:13.330
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is early on,</v>

1662
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:18.460
<v Speaker 3>companies quickly found out that anger drives the most shares on any emotion.</v>

1663
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:21.100
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden we see a wave of police brutality videos.</v>

1664
00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:25.300
<v Speaker 3>There was one website that posted almost exclusively police brutality content</v>

1665
00:41:25.301 --> 00:41:26.170
<v Speaker 3>and it was like Alexa,</v>

1666
00:41:26.171 --> 00:41:27.610
<v Speaker 3>400 in the world,</v>

1667
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:29.500
<v Speaker 3>some ridiculously high number of blew my mind.</v>

1668
00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:30.220
<v Speaker 3>I knew,</v>

1669
00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:30.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1670
00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:34.430
<v Speaker 3>someone claims that they're making six figures writing police brutality articles</v>

1671
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:36.620
<v Speaker 2>because it was pure rage bait,</v>

1672
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1673
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.990
<v Speaker 2>Content that just shares really easily.</v>

1674
00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:43.400
<v Speaker 2>But that content constantly being put in front of somebody breeds an ideology.</v>

1675
00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.750
<v Speaker 2>You then tell someone,</v>

1676
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.400
<v Speaker 2>did you know that?</v>

1677
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1678
00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.180
<v Speaker 2>white supremacy is on the rise and there are 11 million white supremacists in</v>

1679
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:51.290
<v Speaker 2>the US and they go,</v>

1680
00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.153
<v Speaker 2>I can believe it,</v>

1681
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:53.181
<v Speaker 2>but that's nonsense.</v>

1682
00:41:53.181 --> 00:41:53.660
<v Speaker 2>It's just not,</v>

1683
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.590
<v Speaker 2>it's just not the case.</v>

1684
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:55.191
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1685
00:41:55.191 --> 00:41:58.520
<v Speaker 2>the Anti Defamation League and the SPLC say that at rough estimates or maybe</v>

1686
00:41:58.521 --> 00:41:59.540
<v Speaker 2>like 10 or 12,000,</v>

1687
00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:04.130
<v Speaker 2>but people really believe that there is like at the president does secretly a</v>

1688
00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Nazi and that he's being propped up by the secret cabal or there's an</v>

1689
00:42:07.701 --> 00:42:11.990
<v Speaker 2>alternative influence network on Youtube where you and me or somehow trying to</v>

1690
00:42:11.991 --> 00:42:12.950
<v Speaker 2>convince people to,</v>

1691
00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:13.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1692
00:42:13.131 --> 00:42:14.000
<v Speaker 2>this is ridiculous.</v>

1693
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:15.170
<v Speaker 2>So that's the,</v>

1694
00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.370
<v Speaker 2>the main thing.</v>

1695
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1696
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.720
<v Speaker 2>What was it called?</v>

1697
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Data and society.</v>

1698
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:20.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1699
00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:21.890
<v Speaker 2>that's that nonsense.</v>

1700
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:22.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1701
00:42:22.161 --> 00:42:22.550
<v Speaker 2>we did.</v>

1702
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.941
<v Speaker 2>We did.</v>

1703
00:42:22.941 --> 00:42:24.050
<v Speaker 2>We get connected to,</v>

1704
00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.970
<v Speaker 2>are we outright adjacent or we boot licker that one.</v>

1705
00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:30.580
<v Speaker 2>We're part of the network that feeds into extremist ideologies and other.</v>

1706
00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:34.390
<v Speaker 2>They connected me with people with schizophrenia.</v>

1707
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:35.360
<v Speaker 2>The way it's drawn out,</v>

1708
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:38.270
<v Speaker 2>the little map where one person's connected to another person.</v>

1709
00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:39.140
<v Speaker 2>And what I said to her,</v>

1710
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:39.981
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1711
00:42:39.981 --> 00:42:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Barbara Walters interviewed Fidel Castro.</v>

1712
00:42:42.141 --> 00:42:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Did that make her a communist?</v>

1713
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:43.641
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1714
00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:44.391
<v Speaker 2>that's what I tweeted at her.</v>

1715
00:42:44.391 --> 00:42:44.601
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1716
00:42:44.601 --> 00:42:45.081
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy.</v>

1717
00:42:45.081 --> 00:42:46.490
<v Speaker 2>This is a crazy way to look at things.</v>

1718
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.410
<v Speaker 2>But what happened with that story?</v>

1719
00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:50.450
<v Speaker 2>Media reported uncritically.</v>

1720
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.280
<v Speaker 2>I reached out to a bunch of journalists.</v>

1721
00:42:52.281 --> 00:42:53.600
<v Speaker 2>I know a ton of journalists.</v>

1722
00:42:53.601 --> 00:42:53.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

1723

<v Speaker 2>I'm a member of the online news association.</v>

1724
00:42:55.851 --> 00:42:56.230
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1725
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:59.180
<v Speaker 2>I've been a speaker at their events and I'm reaching out to the journalists</v>

1729
00:43:00.891 --> 00:43:02.510
<v Speaker 2>That's just completely fake.</v>

1730
00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.680
<v Speaker 2>It's got my name,</v>

1734
00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.410
<v Speaker 2>They don't do it right.</v>

1735
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.680
<v Speaker 2>They just uncritically reported and there's a couple reasons for it.</v>

1736
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:13.800
<v Speaker 2>The media,</v>

1737
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1738
00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.010
<v Speaker 2>facebook recently changed their algorithm.</v>

1739
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:16.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1740
00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.480
<v Speaker 2>this was a while ago.</v>

1741
00:43:17.481 --> 00:43:18.410
<v Speaker 2>They may have changed it again,</v>

1742
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:23.270
<v Speaker 2>but it was a huge hit to the incomes of a lot of these companies when all of a</v>

1743
00:43:23.271 --> 00:43:26.030
<v Speaker 2>sudden news articles stopped appearing as much because facebook wanted friends</v>

1744
00:43:26.031 --> 00:43:28.910
<v Speaker 2>and family to be more connected and less so news organizations.</v>

1745
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.050
<v Speaker 2>So these news organizations who write this viral clickbait and rage content</v>

1746
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:34.130
<v Speaker 2>weren't getting as much traffic.</v>

1747
00:43:34.131 --> 00:43:34.580
<v Speaker 2>So what are they,</v>

1748
00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:34.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1749
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:35.623
<v Speaker 2>they have to go crazy.</v>

1750
00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:36.643
<v Speaker 2>They have to,</v>

1751
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:36.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1752
00:43:36.921 --> 00:43:37.281
<v Speaker 2>and so it's,</v>

1753
00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:37.471
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1754
00:43:37.471 --> 00:43:41.210
<v Speaker 2>it's a downward spiral of where these journalists all follow each other.</v>

1755
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:42.650
<v Speaker 2>They start producing.</v>

1756
00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:43.441
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1757
00:43:43.441 --> 00:43:44.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a conspiracy.</v>

1758
00:43:44.511 --> 00:43:45.201
<v Speaker 2>They produce this stuff.</v>

1759
00:43:45.201 --> 00:43:49.220
<v Speaker 2>I think they're hired specifically because the content they produce is viral and</v>

1760
00:43:49.221 --> 00:43:50.150
<v Speaker 2>it's viral for a reason.</v>

1761
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1762
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.340
<v Speaker 2>And so the more they produce it,</v>

1763
00:43:52.341 --> 00:43:53.870
<v Speaker 2>the more they eat their own,</v>

1764
00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:54.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1765
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:55.940
<v Speaker 2>excrement essentially.</v>

1766
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:59.540
<v Speaker 2>And then it's a game of telephone where they're sitting in a circle constantly</v>

1767
00:43:59.541 --> 00:44:02.090
<v Speaker 2>telling each other the craziest things and it gets crazier and crazier.</v>

1768
00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.540
<v Speaker 2>But another aspect of it is when they write an article saying,</v>

1769
00:44:05.541 --> 00:44:05.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1770
00:44:05.721 --> 00:44:06.554
<v Speaker 2>trump is racist,</v>

1771
00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:07.730
<v Speaker 2>it goes viral.</v>

1772
00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.380
<v Speaker 2>The next day they can't read the same article.</v>

1773
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.980
<v Speaker 2>So they write,</v>

1774
00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.510
<v Speaker 2>trump is the most racist.</v>

1775
00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.640
<v Speaker 2>The next day they have to get to keep one upping it.</v>

1776
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:14.301
<v Speaker 2>And it gets.</v>

1777
00:44:14.301 --> 00:44:16.220
<v Speaker 2>We talked about this with Forbes articles,</v>

1778
00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.500
<v Speaker 2>the term nasty surprise.</v>

1779
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.000
<v Speaker 2>They use it with tech,</v>

1780
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:24.260
<v Speaker 2>like they'll say the new galaxy s 10 has a nasty surprise.</v>

1781
00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:26.120
<v Speaker 2>The new iphone 10 has a nasty surprise.</v>

1782
00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.410
<v Speaker 2>And keep saying has it,</v>

1783
00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:28.281
<v Speaker 2>it's hilarious.</v>

1784
00:44:28.281 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like there's a form letter and they just take whatever x box,</v>

1785
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.020
<v Speaker 1>stick it in their nasty surprise and it's,</v>

1786
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:38.720
<v Speaker 1>it's 100 percent clickbait and it's Forbes and you telling me that Forbes,</v>

1787
00:44:38.721 --> 00:44:41.640
<v Speaker 1>that was essentially a user contributions.</v>

1788
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:42.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1789
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.720
<v Speaker 3>I could probably submit an article.</v>

1790
00:44:45.721 --> 00:44:48.780
<v Speaker 3>They have like a network of people don't know how you get approved,</v>

1791
00:44:48.781 --> 00:44:51.780
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of articles that get written about like the new video game</v>

1792
00:44:51.781 --> 00:44:52.081
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

1793
00:44:52.081 --> 00:44:54.720
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a clickbait title can just get some ads,</v>

1794
00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:56.090
<v Speaker 1>has a nasty surprise,</v>

1795
00:44:56.091 --> 00:45:00.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost like they have like a pattern that they've just accepted that</v>

1796
00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:01.363
<v Speaker 1>it's going to work.</v>

1797
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:02.630
<v Speaker 3>But it's not a conspiracy.</v>

1798
00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:06.560
<v Speaker 3>It's just like minded people who are only ever around each other,</v>

1799
00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:08.750
<v Speaker 3>sharing the same things among each other,</v>

1800
00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:10.310
<v Speaker 3>believing all the same things.</v>

1801
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:14.540
<v Speaker 3>And so you'll notice that certain words emerge specifically amongst certain</v>

1802
00:45:14.541 --> 00:45:15.230
<v Speaker 3>groups,</v>

1803
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1804
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:19.100
<v Speaker 3>like the left will use certain words and then if like learn to code.</v>

1805
00:45:19.101 --> 00:45:20.990
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't appear that much in left wing rhetoric.</v>

1806
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.190
<v Speaker 3>But the Conservatives and the anti identitarian types understand what it is.</v>

1807
00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:29.570
<v Speaker 3>And so the justification for banning someone for saying learn to code regardless</v>

1808
00:45:29.571 --> 00:45:31.160
<v Speaker 3>of the context seems insane.</v>

1809
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1810
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:32.630
<v Speaker 3>That seems.</v>

1811
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:35.720
<v Speaker 3>It seems like you got one in particular is almost independent.</v>

1812
00:45:35.721 --> 00:45:35.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1813
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.680
<v Speaker 3>not almost.</v>

1814
00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:37.550
<v Speaker 3>That's indefensible.</v>

1815
00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:38.443
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1816
00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.730
<v Speaker 3>Like there have been people who,</v>

1817
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:41.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1818
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:41.560
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

1819
00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:41.691
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

1820
00:45:41.691 --> 00:45:41.820
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

1821
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:42.071
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>

1822
00:45:42.071 --> 00:45:42.800
<v Speaker 3>let me be fair.</v>

1823
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.210
<v Speaker 3>There are people on the left who have been banned.</v>

1824
00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.073
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1825
00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:48.830
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of Venezuelan accounts that were banned and a lot of people were</v>

1826
00:45:48.831 --> 00:45:49.460
<v Speaker 3>very critical.</v>

1827
00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:50.510
<v Speaker 3>I saw Abby Martin was,</v>

1828
00:45:50.511 --> 00:45:53.330
<v Speaker 3>was criticizing this because they accused them of being government actors</v>

1829
00:45:53.331 --> 00:45:54.920
<v Speaker 3>because they were pro Venezuelan government.</v>

1830
00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:55.970
<v Speaker 3>But the most,</v>

1831
00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:56.990
<v Speaker 3>the one thing,</v>

1832
00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:00.170
<v Speaker 3>there's some occupy Wall Street activists who absolutely detested me.</v>

1833
00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:01.393
<v Speaker 3>They lie about me.</v>

1834
00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.050
<v Speaker 3>I do not like them for doing this.</v>

1835
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:05.750
<v Speaker 3>They were banned abruptly for literally no reason.</v>

1836
00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.870
<v Speaker 3>And this is what's more worrisome to me is that no one defended them.</v>

1837
00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.630
<v Speaker 3>No one defended them because conservative certainly won't,</v>

1838
00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.240
<v Speaker 3>but neither will the mainstream,</v>

1839
00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:15.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1840
00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.490
<v Speaker 3>ideological left.</v>

1841
00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.820
<v Speaker 3>These are activists for class issues,</v>

1842
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:22.730
<v Speaker 3>for international issues there on the left squarely.</v>

1843
00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.370
<v Speaker 3>And they were accused guess of being bots or something.</v>

1844
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:29.240
<v Speaker 3>Just it was just an abrupt purge of like 50 accounts and some of them were like</v>

1845
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:33.500
<v Speaker 3>independent citizen journalists just wiped out and with no recourse,</v>

1846
00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:34.850
<v Speaker 3>no recourse whatsoever.</v>

1847
00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:39.880
<v Speaker 3>So I mean at some point you have to realize how important twitter is when the</v>

1848
00:46:39.921 --> 00:46:40.730
<v Speaker 3>president is on it.</v>

1849
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine if there was a physical space where everyone was talking and</v>

1850
00:46:45.141 --> 00:46:48.050
<v Speaker 3>the president shows up and everyone keeps yelling at them and they're all</v>

1851
00:46:48.051 --> 00:46:51.200
<v Speaker 3>talking because you had that lawsuit where they said it was a public forum.</v>

1852
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:56.210
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that happens and then a private private individual bars you from hearing</v>

1853
00:46:56.211 --> 00:46:57.200
<v Speaker 3>what the president has to say.</v>

1854
00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:58.521
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1855
00:46:58.521 --> 00:46:59.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a complicated issue.</v>

1856
00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:01.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1857
00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.920
<v Speaker 3>you get a lot of people on the left saying private businesses can do whatever</v>

1858
00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:04.310
<v Speaker 3>they want.</v>

1859
00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:08.000
<v Speaker 3>That blew my mind because the left was usually about not letting massive</v>

1860
00:47:08.001 --> 00:47:08.631
<v Speaker 3>multinational,</v>

1861
00:47:08.631 --> 00:47:10.910
<v Speaker 3>billion dollar corporations get away with suppressing speech,</v>

1862
00:47:10.911 --> 00:47:11.450
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1863
00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:14.180
<v Speaker 1>it was another thing that people get pissed at me about Jack Dorsey and rightly</v>

1864
00:47:14.181 --> 00:47:19.181
<v Speaker 1>so that he said that it's a human right that the Medicaid online as a human,</v>

1865
00:47:19.191 --> 00:47:20.840
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that he said it,</v>

1866
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:23.270
<v Speaker 1>but yet all these people were banned.</v>

1867
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:27.900
<v Speaker 1>So how was like to take away someone's human right?</v>

1868
00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:31.210
<v Speaker 1>There should be an egregious example.</v>

1869
00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean it should be something like doxing,</v>

1870
00:47:34.181 --> 00:47:36.010
<v Speaker 1>someone like calling for violence,</v>

1871
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.690
<v Speaker 1>like trying and buddy buddy,</v>

1872
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:38.560
<v Speaker 1>but even then,</v>

1873
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.380
<v Speaker 1>but clearly that's not the case if Kathy Griffin still online,</v>

1874
00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:42.160
<v Speaker 1>but hold on,</v>

1875
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.430
<v Speaker 1>you can kill a human being and get 25 years.</v>

1876
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:46.271
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1877
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:46.751
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>

1878
00:47:46.751 --> 00:47:48.580
<v Speaker 1>So you can literally strip someone of their,</v>

1879
00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:49.533
<v Speaker 1>of their.</v>

1880
00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1881
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Everything and still not be purged permanently.</v>

1882
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:56.590
<v Speaker 1>This was one of the things that Jack and I discussed post podcast.</v>

1883
00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:57.340
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1884
00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:57.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1885
00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:59.860
<v Speaker 1>when we were going back and forth about doing this again,</v>

1886
00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:00.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1887
00:48:00.151 --> 00:48:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I told him I would really like to see if there's some sort of a path to</v>

1888
00:48:04.871 --> 00:48:05.704
<v Speaker 1>redemption,</v>

1889
00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:06.940
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>

1890
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:07.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1891
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:08.081
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1892
00:48:08.081 --> 00:48:08.914
<v Speaker 1>for Milo,</v>

1893
00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:09.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1894
00:48:09.341 --> 00:48:13.690
<v Speaker 1>who's to say like we talked about yesterday about Christian ecoline who was a</v>

1895
00:48:13.691 --> 00:48:18.691
<v Speaker 1>white supremacist who realized the error of his ways and then became this</v>

1896
00:48:19.481 --> 00:48:23.680
<v Speaker 1>activist against racism and now he gives these ted speeches and he's,</v>

1897
00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:24.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1898
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:29.140
<v Speaker 1>wha accepted by everyone as being this guy who's achieved redemption and really</v>

1899
00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:30.760
<v Speaker 1>understands the error of his ways.</v>

1900
00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.800
<v Speaker 1>If Milo was banned for life,</v>

1901
00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Milo is only like 34 years old.</v>

1902
00:48:34.601 --> 00:48:34.811
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1903
00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:36.550
<v Speaker 1>How old is Milo around there?</v>

1904
00:48:36.551 --> 00:48:37.384
<v Speaker 1>I honestly don't know.</v>

1905
00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:37.550
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1906
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:38.080
<v Speaker 1>I hope,</v>

1907
00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.150
<v Speaker 1>I hope I didn't make them older than he is and probably be mad,</v>

1908
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:41.410
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it is,</v>

1909
00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.390
<v Speaker 1>like who's to say that Milo,</v>

1910
00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:44.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1911
00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:48.070
<v Speaker 1>in three years from now won't have a change of heart or you know,</v>

1912
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:49.750
<v Speaker 1>have a fucking acid trip or something.</v>

1913
00:48:49.751 --> 00:48:50.250
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1914
00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:51.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm a different person.</v>

1915
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:52.870
<v Speaker 1>But if you're banned for life,</v>

1916
00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:53.791
<v Speaker 1>we are.</v>

1917
00:48:53.791 --> 00:48:57.870
<v Speaker 1>We throwing people away like you ever see that tweet from like,</v>

1918
00:48:58.210 --> 00:48:58.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say,</v>

1919
00:48:58.691 --> 00:48:59.560
<v Speaker 1>I think it was tyler,</v>

1920
00:48:59.561 --> 00:49:00.850
<v Speaker 1>the creator where he said,</v>

1921
00:49:00.851 --> 00:49:02.110
<v Speaker 1>how is cyber bullying real?</v>

1922
00:49:02.111 --> 00:49:02.351
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

1923
00:49:02.351 --> 00:49:02.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1924
00:49:02.561 --> 00:49:03.430
<v Speaker 1>like close your eyes.</v>

1925
00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Go inside,</v>

1926
00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.373
<v Speaker 1>close your eyes.</v>

1927
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:06.190
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1928
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:06.550
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1929
00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:07.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry man.</v>

1930
00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:08.591
<v Speaker 1>You want a band?</v>

1931
00:49:08.591 --> 00:49:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Hate speech.</v>

1932
00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I can understand.</v>

1933
00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:11.620
<v Speaker 1>I am no fan of hate speech.</v>

1934
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.633
<v Speaker 1>I think it's wrong.</v>

1935
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I think you shouldn't target people for,</v>

1936
00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:15.730
<v Speaker 1>for a specific characteristics.</v>

1937
00:49:15.731 --> 00:49:16.630
<v Speaker 1>We should respect one another.</v>

1938
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:17.561
<v Speaker 1>At the same time.</v>

1939
00:49:17.561 --> 00:49:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm also a human adult who understands sometimes people are mean.</v>

1940
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:22.120
<v Speaker 1>You ever walked out?</v>

1941
00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:25.030
<v Speaker 1>You ever go to a subway in Los Angeles and some guy starts calling you all the</v>

1942
00:49:25.031 --> 00:49:25.710
<v Speaker 1>names in the book.</v>

1943
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:26.543
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do about it?</v>

1944
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:27.663
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

1945
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:28.751
<v Speaker 1>That's just life.</v>

1946
00:49:28.751 --> 00:49:30.670
<v Speaker 1>People are mean sometimes if they punched you,</v>

1947
00:49:30.671 --> 00:49:31.504
<v Speaker 1>that crossed the line.</v>

1948
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.501
<v Speaker 1>But on twitter,</v>

1949
00:49:32.501 --> 00:49:32.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1950
00:49:32.681 --> 00:49:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Milo wants say mean things block mute.</v>

1951
00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:34.970
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'd do?</v>

1952
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:35.520
<v Speaker 1>I press.</v>

1953
00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1954
00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:37.450
<v Speaker 1>mute black people.</v>

1955
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:38.540
<v Speaker 1>I blocked some people.</v>

1956
00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.311
<v Speaker 1>You had the Milo.</v>

1957
00:49:39.311 --> 00:49:40.810
<v Speaker 1>One was very,</v>

1958
00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:41.673
<v Speaker 1>very weird.</v>

1959
00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:42.900
<v Speaker 1>They were looking for.</v>

1960
00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.440
<v Speaker 1>And here's the other part of it,</v>

1961
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:49.590
<v Speaker 1>you know what he ultimately got in trouble air quotes for was him talking about</v>

1962
00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:56.221
<v Speaker 1>the positive experiences that he had as a young man being molested.</v>

1963
00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:58.660
<v Speaker 1>I think that was after he was already band though.</v>

1964
00:49:58.900 --> 00:49:59.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1965
00:49:59.530 --> 00:49:59.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1966
00:49:59.651 --> 00:50:01.180
<v Speaker 1>he might've been banned from twitter already,</v>

1967
00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.820
<v Speaker 1>but then he got kicked off of Youtube and he left.</v>

1968
00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:04.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he stayed off youtube.</v>

1969
00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:05.291
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1970
00:50:05.291 --> 00:50:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I think he's still on Youtube.</v>

1971
00:50:06.161 --> 00:50:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Was it,</v>

1972
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:08.290
<v Speaker 1>was it Breitbart that he left fired?</v>

1973
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:09.190
<v Speaker 1>He quit Breitbart,</v>

1974
00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Breitbart.</v>

1975
00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:11.380
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing too though.</v>

1976
00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1977
00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:12.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1978
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I see all these journalists writing all these articles saying like,</v>

1979
00:50:15.221 --> 00:50:16.001
<v Speaker 1>Milo has gone,</v>

1980
00:50:16.001 --> 00:50:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Milo is whining and he's no more.</v>

1981
00:50:17.621 --> 00:50:17.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1982
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Dude's got like 6 million followers across his instagram is youtube and his</v>

1983
00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:22.240
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

1984
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.120
<v Speaker 1>he posts all the time you have.</v>

1985
00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:27.920
<v Speaker 1>He's not in the public conversation as much as he was before because</v>

1986
00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.080
<v Speaker 2>Dave censored him when you're not on twitter.</v>

1987
00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1988
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:34.790
<v Speaker 2>The journalists who make up a huge core of their verified users who apparently</v>

1989
00:50:34.791 --> 00:50:35.540
<v Speaker 2>according to CNN and a car,</v>

1990
00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:36.190
<v Speaker 2>like the lifeblood,</v>

1991
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:36.860
<v Speaker 2>their platform on top.</v>

1992
00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:37.693
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about you.</v>

1993
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.230
<v Speaker 2>But here's my point,</v>

1994
00:50:39.231 --> 00:50:43.220
<v Speaker 2>he's not saying that men should go have sex with younger boys.</v>

1995
00:50:43.221 --> 00:50:46.130
<v Speaker 2>He was basically saying that it could be a positive experience because it was</v>

1996
00:50:46.131 --> 00:50:46.660
<v Speaker 2>for him.</v>

1997
00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1998
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:47.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1999
00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:50.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about what happened in that capacity in my.</v>

2000
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:54.020
<v Speaker 2>My point was if I said when I was 13,</v>

2001
00:50:54.021 --> 00:50:55.880
<v Speaker 2>a 21 year old girl fondled me,</v>

2002
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.580
<v Speaker 2>do you think I'd get in trouble if I said it was awesome?</v>

2003
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:00.080
<v Speaker 2>No better wouldn't.</v>

2004
00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.440
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't know.</v>

2005
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:03.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2006
00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.510
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

2007
00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:09.950
<v Speaker 2>My brother was pointing out because a law and order Svu is basically on 24 slash</v>

2008
00:51:09.951 --> 00:51:10.500
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>

2009
00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:13.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like 98 percent of the episodes are only ever about women.</v>

2010
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:14.720
<v Speaker 2>Never about men being victims.</v>

2011
00:51:14.721 --> 00:51:15.554
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they are.</v>

2012
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:16.663
<v Speaker 2>But he was like,</v>

2013
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:17.121
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2014
00:51:17.121 --> 00:51:17.880
<v Speaker 2>I just realized that.</v>

2015
00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2016
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.333
<v Speaker 2>let's decide.</v>

2017
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Well that's special victims unit.</v>

2018
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:21.741
<v Speaker 2>That's the show.</v>

2019
00:51:21.741 --> 00:51:22.041
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

2020
00:51:22.041 --> 00:51:22.490
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2021
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:24.560
<v Speaker 2>they have so many versions of law and order.</v>

2022
00:51:24.561 --> 00:51:25.640
<v Speaker 2>But that one in particular,</v>

2023
00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:25.931
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2024
00:51:25.931 --> 00:51:27.380
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it deals with sex crimes.</v>

2025
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2026
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:30.470
<v Speaker 2>And almost every episode rarely ever talks about male victims,</v>

2027
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:31.603
<v Speaker 2>which exists.</v>

2028
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:32.151
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2029
00:51:32.151 --> 00:51:33.280
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>

2030
00:51:33.281 --> 00:51:35.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get like into a men's rights thing,</v>

2031
00:51:35.301 --> 00:51:35.541
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

2032
00:51:35.541 --> 00:51:37.550
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fairly obvious to a lot of people.</v>

2033
00:51:37.551 --> 00:51:38.384
<v Speaker 2>Like you mentioned,</v>

2034
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.140
<v Speaker 2>if you said it,</v>

2035
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.670
<v Speaker 2>nobody would have cared but Milo's gay.</v>

2036
00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2037
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.983
<v Speaker 2>And so that becomes,</v>

2038
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2039
00:51:42.211 --> 00:51:43.040
<v Speaker 2>becomes a thing for him.</v>

2040
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:43.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2041
00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2042
00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.133
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2043
00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:46.013
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

2044
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:48.743
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2045
00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:52.610
<v Speaker 2>we need some kind of clear guidelines,</v>

2046
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:53.630
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2047
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:57.310
<v Speaker 2>where you can operate inside these guidelines and also fair.</v>

2048
00:51:58.500 --> 00:51:59.030
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2049
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2050
00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:00.230
<v Speaker 2>to an extent,</v>

2051
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:01.960
<v Speaker 2>to an extent that it is tough shit.</v>

2052
00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Comedians will be allowed to operate dancing on the line,</v>

2053
00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:06.283
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2054
00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Like obviously I think so I'll tell you,</v>

2055
00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.210
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you this shit.</v>

2056
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you something after this is over,</v>

2057
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:15.980
<v Speaker 2>you're going to think it's hilarious and we'll find out about it in the future.</v>

2058
00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:16.181
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2059
00:52:16.181 --> 00:52:17.660
<v Speaker 2>not everyone's going to be secret.</v>

2060
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:17.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2061
00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:17.881
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2062
00:52:17.881 --> 00:52:17.991
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2063
00:52:17.991 --> 00:52:18.621
<v Speaker 2>It's not a secret.</v>

2064
00:52:18.621 --> 00:52:19.820
<v Speaker 2>It's a comedy secret.</v>

2065
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:20.170
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2066
00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:21.260
<v Speaker 2>it's about something.</v>

2067
00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.070
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2068
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:22.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2069
00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.280
<v Speaker 2>but I'll take this call you to remind me,</v>

2070
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:28.340
<v Speaker 2>but I'll take this opportunity to segue into another point when it comes to the</v>

2071
00:52:28.341 --> 00:52:28.761
<v Speaker 2>bias,</v>

2072
00:52:28.761 --> 00:52:29.594
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2073
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:31.550
<v Speaker 2>How is it that you can have Jimmy Kimmel,</v>

2074
00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Fallon dress in black face on there?</v>

2075
00:52:34.371 --> 00:52:37.160
<v Speaker 2>Glen a CNN made a big list.</v>

2076
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:38.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly when it happened.</v>

2077
00:52:38.241 --> 00:52:40.010
<v Speaker 2>I think a kimball was on the man show.</v>

2078
00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:41.870
<v Speaker 2>He dressed like a basketball player.</v>

2079
00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jeez.</v>

2080
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:43.251
<v Speaker 2>And Jimmy Fallon.</v>

2081
00:52:43.251 --> 00:52:44.084
<v Speaker 2>Just like Chris Rock.</v>

2082
00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:44.331
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2083
00:52:44.331 --> 00:52:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

2084
00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Sarah Silverman did it.</v>

2085
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.641
<v Speaker 2>She.</v>

2086
00:52:46.641 --> 00:52:47.720
<v Speaker 2>I think she addressed it though.</v>

2087
00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2088
00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>

2089
00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Nobody loses their minds.</v>

2090
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.960
<v Speaker 2>Nobody loses their minds over that because they're on the left,</v>

2091
00:52:52.961 --> 00:52:53.450
<v Speaker 2>you think?</v>

2092
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:53.961
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

2093
00:52:53.961 --> 00:52:54.440
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

2094
00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:54.681
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2095
00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:54.861
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2096
00:52:54.861 --> 00:52:55.071
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2097
00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:55.904
<v Speaker 2>I honestly,</v>

2098
00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:58.040
<v Speaker 2>I would say to an extent,</v>

2099
00:52:58.070 --> 00:52:59.750
<v Speaker 2>there's probably some kind of tribal bias.</v>

2100
00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2101
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:03.470
<v Speaker 2>I think when you're going back to high school yearbooks looking for outrage from</v>

2102
00:53:03.471 --> 00:53:04.940
<v Speaker 2>55 year old people,</v>

2103
00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:06.350
<v Speaker 2>if you've lost the plot,</v>

2104
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.980
<v Speaker 2>isn't that.</v>

2105
00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:07.551
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that crazy?</v>

2106
00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:08.420
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking insane.</v>

2107
00:53:08.421 --> 00:53:08.511
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2108
00:53:08.511 --> 00:53:08.691
<v Speaker 2>what's.</v>

2109
00:53:08.691 --> 00:53:11.690
<v Speaker 2>What's crazier is when Kathy Griffin tweets out that the three points are hand</v>

2110
00:53:11.691 --> 00:53:14.630
<v Speaker 2>sign at a Covington basketball game was a Nazi hand gesture.</v>

2111
00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:16.381
<v Speaker 2>Like the three point.</v>

2112
00:53:16.381 --> 00:53:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2113
00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.780
<v Speaker 2>to three point seven as this thing.</v>

2114
00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2115
00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:18.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2116
00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2117
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do it because the photos a little slow.</v>

2118
00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:21.213
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2119
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.751
<v Speaker 2>People send it,</v>

2120
00:53:21.751 --> 00:53:26.700
<v Speaker 2>definitely put a series of them on my instagram when I found out I put bill</v>

2121
00:53:26.701 --> 00:53:27.600
<v Speaker 2>cosby doing it.</v>

2122
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Someone found one of me from news radio.</v>

2123
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:31.483
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it?</v>

2124
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:31.861
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it?</v>

2125
00:53:31.861 --> 00:53:32.970
<v Speaker 2>Aren't they using it though,</v>

2126
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.870
<v Speaker 2>for that symbol?</v>

2127
00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:34.670
<v Speaker 2>I know that it's a,</v>

2128
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:35.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a universal symbol.</v>

2129
00:53:35.641 --> 00:53:36.810
<v Speaker 2>That means a lot of things,</v>

2130
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:38.670
<v Speaker 2>but using it as that symbol,</v>

2131
00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:40.400
<v Speaker 2>they're not using it to mean white power and.</v>

2132
00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:40.471
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2133
00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:41.240
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

2134
00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:42.470
<v Speaker 2>What are the one that said it's not?</v>

2135

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2136

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:11.551
<v Speaker 2>I can explain this to you.</v>

2167

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2168
00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Please do.</v>

2169
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.991
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump,</v>

2170
00:54:12.991 --> 00:54:13.501
<v Speaker 2>when he talks,</v>

2171
00:54:13.501 --> 00:54:14.570
<v Speaker 2>he makes the okay sign.</v>

2172
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:16.201
<v Speaker 2>He's pointing.</v>

2173
00:54:16.201 --> 00:54:17.034
<v Speaker 2>He's making.</v>

2174
00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:17.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2175
00:54:17.371 --> 00:54:17.611
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2176
00:54:17.611 --> 00:54:18.421
<v Speaker 2>well if he does it this way,</v>

2177
00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:19.254
<v Speaker 2>is that okay?</v>

2178
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:19.631
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

2179
00:54:19.631 --> 00:54:19.801
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2180
00:54:19.801 --> 00:54:20.634
<v Speaker 2>He does this.</v>

2181
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:21.181
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2182
00:54:21.181 --> 00:54:23.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what trump does the flip people off.</v>

2183
00:54:23.611 --> 00:54:24.444
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a bad thing,</v>

2184
00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:24.841
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

2185
00:54:24.841 --> 00:54:26.490
<v Speaker 2>So what happens is he starts doing the.</v>

2186
00:54:26.491 --> 00:54:26.701
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2187
00:54:26.701 --> 00:54:27.220
<v Speaker 2>10 they'll.</v>

2188
00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2189
00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:27.721
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2190
00:54:27.721 --> 00:54:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Sign.</v>

2191
00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:30.360
<v Speaker 2>So a bunch of trump supporters start doing it too,</v>

2192
00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:31.111
<v Speaker 2>to be like,</v>

2193
00:54:31.111 --> 00:54:31.261
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2194
00:54:31.261 --> 00:54:31.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm like trump.</v>

2195
00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2196
00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:34.530
<v Speaker 2>A four Chan campaign gets started saying,</v>

2197
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.430
<v Speaker 2>convince everyone.</v>

2198
00:54:35.431 --> 00:54:36.690
<v Speaker 2>This actually means white power,</v>

2199
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:37.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2200
00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:37.920
<v Speaker 2>It was fake.</v>

2201
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.960
<v Speaker 2>The Anti Defamation League said it was fake.</v>

2202
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2203
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.330
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of journalists said it was real.</v>

2204
00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:44.010
<v Speaker 2>That's what I put on my instagram.</v>

2205
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Put all this on my instagram,</v>

2206
00:54:45.601 --> 00:54:49.170
<v Speaker 2>including the article where would show the original thing came fortunate.</v>

2207
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:50.011
<v Speaker 2>Fortunate.</v>

2208
00:54:50.011 --> 00:54:50.940
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hilarious.</v>

2209
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Powerful.</v>

2210
00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:52.290
<v Speaker 2>It's Whoa.</v>

2211
00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:54.180
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious how much shit they start.</v>

2212
00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.680
<v Speaker 2>They started the flat earth movement.</v>

2213
00:54:55.681 --> 00:54:55.921
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2214
00:54:55.921 --> 00:54:56.860
<v Speaker 2>There's the guy was that?</v>

2215
00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:57.960
<v Speaker 2>I'd never heard that.</v>

2216
00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2217
00:54:58.330 --> 00:54:58.850
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2218
00:54:58.850 --> 00:54:59.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2219
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:03.050
<v Speaker 2>They started to look at this photo and see if I could give you a little bit.</v>

2220
00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:05.100
<v Speaker 2>It popped up to conspiracy.</v>

2221
00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:05.920
<v Speaker 2>How do we get it back?</v>

2222
00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.230
<v Speaker 2>It's that what's going on?</v>

2223
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:09.420
<v Speaker 2>The connection to the TV's just died out.</v>

2224
00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:10.393
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

2225
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:12.420
<v Speaker 2>No Hollywood conspiracy.</v>

2226
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:15.120
<v Speaker 2>The button that I have is making it go there and it's not going there,</v>

2227
00:55:15.121 --> 00:55:15.780
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know.</v>

2228
00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:16.141
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

2229
00:55:16.141 --> 00:55:16.481
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

2230
00:55:16.481 --> 00:55:19.380
<v Speaker 2>This gremlins in this fucking will figure it out.</v>

2231
00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:20.010
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to.</v>

2232
00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:20.730
<v Speaker 2>Allegedly.</v>

2233
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:21.600
<v Speaker 2>I would say this.</v>

2234
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:22.730
<v Speaker 2>We need to see that though.</v>

2235
00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:24.140
<v Speaker 2>My laptop.</v>

2236
00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2237
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Show.</v>

2238
00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Show me a laptop.</v>

2239
00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:26.490
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

2240
00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:27.450
<v Speaker 2>I would be willing to.</v>

2241
00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:27.931
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2242
00:55:27.931 --> 00:55:28.764
<v Speaker 2>There's the image.</v>

2243
00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Take a good look at it,</v>

2244
00:55:29.941 --> 00:55:30.390
<v Speaker 2>tim.</v>

2245
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:31.030
<v Speaker 2>So okay.</v>

2246
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.680
<v Speaker 2>These guys,</v>

2247
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.610
<v Speaker 2>they see what's on their leg.</v>

2248
00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2249
00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.610
<v Speaker 2>That's specifically a game where when you look at it,</v>

2250
00:55:35.611 --> 00:55:36.444
<v Speaker 2>they get to punch you,</v>

2251
00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.820
<v Speaker 2>that they're not holding the hand sign up.</v>

2252
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:41.850
<v Speaker 2>They're not flashing it like you see conservatives do.</v>

2253
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2254
00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not denying that is a game,</v>

2255
00:55:43.711 --> 00:55:47.910
<v Speaker 2>but to say that that's what those guys are doing is a bit of a stretch,</v>

2256
00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:48.480
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

2257
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2258
00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:49.453
<v Speaker 2>what do you think they're doing?</v>

2259
00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:52.050
<v Speaker 2>What does it have to say that if,</v>

2260
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:57.080
<v Speaker 2>if fortune did that to make to mix it up at some point people would think that</v>

2261
00:55:57.511 --> 00:55:58.344
<v Speaker 2>that is true though.</v>

2262
00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:02.610
<v Speaker 2>That's like no way that's happening.</v>

2263
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:02.851
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2264
00:56:02.851 --> 00:56:03.661
<v Speaker 2>I'll say this is.</v>

2265
00:56:03.661 --> 00:56:04.030
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2266
00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2267
00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.970
<v Speaker 2>there's be bleeding free.</v>

2268
00:56:05.971 --> 00:56:07.310
<v Speaker 2>Bleeding came from fortune,</v>

2269
00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:07.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2270
00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:10.440
<v Speaker 2>Have you don't know what French people explain that to people.</v>

2271
00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:13.950
<v Speaker 2>It's all you free bleeding was fortunate.</v>

2272
00:56:13.951 --> 00:56:15.000
<v Speaker 2>Thought it would be hilarious.</v>

2273
00:56:15.001 --> 00:56:15.301
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

2274
00:56:15.301 --> 00:56:17.610
<v Speaker 2>Shiela Bu was at the comedy store last night.</v>

2275
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:20.460
<v Speaker 2>I wonder why because we're always ragging on him.</v>

2276
00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Free bleeding came from four chan where they said</v>

2277
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:29.490
<v Speaker 3>that they were promoting this idea that for women's rights that they would,</v>

2278
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:30.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2279
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:31.023
<v Speaker 3>get away,</v>

2280
00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:35.050
<v Speaker 3>get away from this whole idea of you have to control your menstrual cycle.</v>

2281
00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:35.371
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2282
00:56:35.371 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 3>it's empowering to just bleed all over your crotch.</v>

2283
00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:42.130
<v Speaker 3>And so women actually started doing it because it actually,</v>

2284
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.320
<v Speaker 3>if you can fucking,</v>

2285
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.690
<v Speaker 3>if you can get those ideas out there,</v>

2286
00:56:46.691 --> 00:56:49.900
<v Speaker 3>a certain number of knuckleheads are going to take it and run with it and think</v>

2287
00:56:49.901 --> 00:56:50.231
<v Speaker 3>it's real.</v>

2288
00:56:50.231 --> 00:56:51.740
<v Speaker 3>Of course you don't think that's possible.</v>

2289
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:52.660
<v Speaker 3>The white power though,</v>

2290
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:54.790
<v Speaker 3>I think it's extremely unlikely.</v>

2291
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:55.640
<v Speaker 3>I think it's.</v>

2292
00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:56.440
<v Speaker 3>It's possible.</v>

2293
00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:56.921
<v Speaker 3>So here's the thing,</v>

2294
00:56:56.921 --> 00:56:58.090
<v Speaker 3>nothing's absolute right.</v>

2295
00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.430
<v Speaker 3>Are there some some white supremacists who are doing it for sure,</v>

2296
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.091
<v Speaker 3>but you don't.</v>

2297
00:57:01.091 --> 00:57:03.850
<v Speaker 3>You think you looking at bad asses with fucking guns.</v>

2298
00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:08.050
<v Speaker 3>They're playing this little silly game to really.</v>

2299
00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:09.460
<v Speaker 3>I think there are a bunch of bros.</v>

2300
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Who are you ever.</v>

2301
00:57:10.661 --> 00:57:11.171
<v Speaker 3>You ever hang out With?</v>

2302
00:57:11.171 --> 00:57:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Like some frat dudes at a college,</v>

2303
00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:14.590
<v Speaker 3>they punch each other.</v>

2304
00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:15.760
<v Speaker 3>That's there's a game.</v>

2305
00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:16.990
<v Speaker 3>So how's it go again?</v>

2306
00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:17.440
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2307
00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:18.520
<v Speaker 3>you make the okay hand sign.</v>

2308
00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:18.881
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2309
00:57:18.881 --> 00:57:21.090
<v Speaker 3>And you hold it under a table or on on your leg.</v>

2310
00:57:21.091 --> 00:57:21.790
<v Speaker 3>These are adults.</v>

2311
00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:23.380
<v Speaker 3>These are guys that are not in college.</v>

2312
00:57:23.381 --> 00:57:25.780
<v Speaker 3>They're definitely not a below 25 years old,</v>

2313
00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:26.643
<v Speaker 3>but what does that mean?</v>

2314
00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:31.450
<v Speaker 3>I know I know 40 year old guys who play pokemon go is a game.</v>

2315
00:57:31.451 --> 00:57:32.580
<v Speaker 3>You fix this fucking thing.</v>

2316
00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:33.443
<v Speaker 3>Well</v>

2317
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.751
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2318
00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:36.170
<v Speaker 3>but what the gender,</v>

2319
00:57:36.250 --> 00:57:37.330
<v Speaker 3>what is their job?</v>

2320
00:57:37.331 --> 00:57:37.751
<v Speaker 3>What would they.</v>

2321
00:57:37.751 --> 00:57:41.050
<v Speaker 3>Their swat team guys is that they were arresting a drug dealer and what do,</v>

2322
00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:41.801
<v Speaker 3>what do you think they're doing?</v>

2323
00:57:41.801 --> 00:57:44.680
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to make sure everybody knows that they're flashing and overt</v>

2324
00:57:44.681 --> 00:57:47.170
<v Speaker 3>white power hand gesture because everyone knows that's what it means.</v>

2325
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:48.970
<v Speaker 3>That somebody didn't think everyone knew.</v>

2326
00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:49.691
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2327
00:57:49.691 --> 00:57:49.811
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2328
00:57:49.811 --> 00:57:50.261
<v Speaker 3>that's just not.</v>

2329
00:57:50.261 --> 00:57:51.011
<v Speaker 3>It's just not the case.</v>

2330
00:57:51.011 --> 00:57:53.530
<v Speaker 3>The thing that the point is holding the.</v>

2331
00:57:53.531 --> 00:57:55.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay sign up next to you is what's key.</v>

2332
00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:56.440
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2333
00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:56.950
<v Speaker 3>people say it,</v>

2334
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:57.820
<v Speaker 3>it's the w in the peat.</v>

2335
00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:01.210
<v Speaker 3>Putting it on your leg has always been the punch him game or whatever.</v>

2336
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:02.980
<v Speaker 3>Like I know that punch them,</v>

2337
00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:05.020
<v Speaker 3>punch them game 100 percent,</v>

2338
00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:09.280
<v Speaker 3>put it the okay symbol on your leg or under a table and you say,</v>

2339
00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:09.791
<v Speaker 3>hey look.</v>

2340
00:58:09.791 --> 00:58:10.630
<v Speaker 3>And if they look on and see it,</v>

2341
00:58:10.631 --> 00:58:10.840
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

2342
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:11.111
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2343
00:58:11.111 --> 00:58:11.944
<v Speaker 3>and then you punched him in the arm.</v>

2344
00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.740
<v Speaker 3>But I know it so well that I,</v>

2345
00:58:14.741 --> 00:58:17.600
<v Speaker 3>that's why I don't think that's what they're doing like me and my friends play</v>

2346
00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:18.130
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2347
00:58:18.130 --> 00:58:19.420
<v Speaker 3>So then the question is,</v>

2348
00:58:19.421 --> 00:58:19.680
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2349
00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:20.980
<v Speaker 3>so it's a major.</v>

2350
00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:22.150
<v Speaker 3>It's made you look made,</v>

2351
00:58:22.151 --> 00:58:22.670
<v Speaker 3>you look right.</v>

2352
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.960
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2353
00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.370
<v Speaker 3>but what are they doing right?</v>

2354
00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2355
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:25.000
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2356
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:25.271
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2357
00:58:25.271 --> 00:58:25.960
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2358
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:26.530
<v Speaker 3>If you wanna,</v>

2359
00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:29.230
<v Speaker 3>if you want to make assumptions about what you think their intentions were,</v>

2360
00:58:29.231 --> 00:58:29.471
<v Speaker 3>that's all.</v>

2361
00:58:29.471 --> 00:58:33.190
<v Speaker 3>You don't have any facts to support that and the only thing I know of is there</v>

2362
00:58:33.191 --> 00:58:35.740
<v Speaker 3>that game where you put the okay sign in your leg and then you punch somebody</v>

2363
00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:37.360
<v Speaker 3>and here's some guys putting the case on their leg.</v>

2364
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:38.351
<v Speaker 3>What evidence do we have?</v>

2365
00:58:38.351 --> 00:58:39.190
<v Speaker 3>It's anything other than that,</v>

2366
00:58:39.191 --> 00:58:39.620
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

2367
00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:40.453
<v Speaker 3>So that that's.</v>

2368
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna go any Further than that.</v>

2369
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:42.731
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say,</v>

2370
00:58:42.731 --> 00:58:43.570
<v Speaker 3>was it poor judgment?</v>

2371
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:43.691
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2372
00:58:43.691 --> 00:58:44.524
<v Speaker 3>hell yeah.</v>

2373
00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:45.070
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

2374
00:58:45.070 --> 00:58:45.903
<v Speaker 3>But listen,</v>

2375
00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:48.610
<v Speaker 3>do you know about what happened in philly with these marines who got beat up by</v>

2376
00:58:48.611 --> 00:58:49.444
<v Speaker 3>antifa?</v>

2377
00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:49.840
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2378
00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:50.500
<v Speaker 3>I do not.</v>

2379
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:50.980
<v Speaker 3>So there's some.</v>

2380
00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:55.090
<v Speaker 3>So there was a rally put on by some constitutional libertarian.</v>

2381
00:58:55.091 --> 00:58:56.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly what it was all about.</v>

2382
00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:58.450
<v Speaker 3>Antifa shows up in protests.</v>

2383
00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:02.860
<v Speaker 3>Some marines apparently are just walking by because there was a marine event.</v>

2384
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Antifa sees them and yells,</v>

2385
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:05.793
<v Speaker 3>are you proud?</v>

2386
00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:06.933
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>

2387
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:07.391
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>

2388
00:59:07.391 --> 00:59:07.841
<v Speaker 3>I'm a marine,</v>

2389
00:59:07.841 --> 00:59:08.051
<v Speaker 3>and said,</v>

2390
00:59:08.051 --> 00:59:08.890
<v Speaker 3>are you a proud boy?</v>

2391
00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:10.053
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

2392
00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:10.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2393
00:59:10.421 --> 00:59:10.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2394
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:11.770
<v Speaker 3>They'd beat them up.</v>

2395
00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:12.700
<v Speaker 3>These they arrested,</v>

2396
00:59:12.701 --> 00:59:14.470
<v Speaker 3>several people charged with multiple felonies.</v>

2397
00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Marines got beat up.</v>

2398
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:16.871
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know it.</v>

2399
00:59:16.871 --> 00:59:17.704
<v Speaker 3>Proud boy was.</v>

2400
00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:21.760
<v Speaker 3>So to assume that these guys know anything about what's going on in,</v>

2401
00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 3>in</v>

2402
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.150
<v Speaker 2>cultural politics,</v>

2403
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:23.900
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2404
00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:24.171
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2405
00:59:24.171 --> 00:59:24.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2406
00:59:24.411 --> 00:59:27.740
<v Speaker 2>when you're in the know and you're on twitter when you're reading the news all</v>

2407
00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:27.920
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

2408
00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:28.730
<v Speaker 2>you look at the insight,</v>

2409
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:29.720
<v Speaker 2>they knew what they were doing,</v>

2410
00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.870
<v Speaker 2>what these are small like what city of these guys from even do they watch the</v>

2411
00:59:32.871 --> 00:59:33.351
<v Speaker 2>news all day?</v>

2412
00:59:33.351 --> 00:59:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Do they go on four chan,</v>

2413
00:59:34.431 --> 00:59:37.490
<v Speaker 2>do they go on vox.com and read and know what this is about.</v>

2414
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:37.911
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2415
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I appreciaTe your looking at this with a broad perspective,</v>

2416
00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:44.510
<v Speaker 2>but it is entirely possible that they did.</v>

2417
00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:45.020
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2418
00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:47.690
<v Speaker 2>It's also entirely possible that within their friend group it means you're</v>

2419
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:48.524
<v Speaker 2>buying lunch.</v>

2420
00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:49.820
<v Speaker 2>It could mean a million things.</v>

2421
00:59:49.821 --> 00:59:54.821
<v Speaker 2>It could mean in the cultural context of 2018 when this happened.</v>

2422
00:59:55.721 --> 00:59:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2423
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.800
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

2424
00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh the okay symbol doesn't even mean white power.</v>

2425
00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:00.180
<v Speaker 2>It iS,</v>

2426
01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:00.711
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

2427
01:00:00.711 --> 01:00:04.080
<v Speaker 2>It is a tribal sign among anti identify,</v>

2428
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.980
<v Speaker 2>anti intersectional and trump supporters.</v>

2429
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:09.110
<v Speaker 2>But don't you remember when was there?</v>

2430
01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:10.880
<v Speaker 2>There was a woman that got in trouble for it.</v>

2431
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:13.010
<v Speaker 2>She was in court and she had it on her arm.</v>

2432
01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.930
<v Speaker 2>She was just standing there like so insane.</v>

2433
01:00:14.931 --> 01:00:16.910
<v Speaker 2>So insane because she was basically,</v>

2434
01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.570
<v Speaker 2>she had her finger and her thumb like that.</v>

2435
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.750
<v Speaker 2>And they and they and they went wild with it.</v>

2436
01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2437
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:22.170
<v Speaker 2>She's making powers.</v>

2438
01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.670
<v Speaker 2>You have to understand when I see that and I see that you kicked me out,</v>

2439
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:28.610
<v Speaker 2>but there's a difference between someone just moving their hands around and</v>

2440
01:00:28.611 --> 01:00:29.790
<v Speaker 2>doing this and you know,</v>

2441
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:31.190
<v Speaker 2>making a weird thing she did.</v>

2442
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:32.930
<v Speaker 2>She did fall onto it the next day though.</v>

2443
01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.073
<v Speaker 2>Probably on purpose.</v>

2444
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

2445
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what she does when she puts her on there.</v>

2446
01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:40.400
<v Speaker 2>You have to assume she's watching the news,</v>

2447
01:00:40.401 --> 01:00:41.370
<v Speaker 2>then I would.</v>

2448
01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.410
<v Speaker 2>She's sitting in the cabinet hearing,</v>

2449
01:00:42.411 --> 01:00:45.710
<v Speaker 2>but it's entirely possible that I'll be an unlikely that she was just telling</v>

2450
01:00:45.711 --> 01:00:46.040
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>

2451
01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:46.873
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2452
01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Like she was.</v>

2453
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:50.950
<v Speaker 2>She's used to doing that with her arm.</v>

2454
01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.070
<v Speaker 2>I think about it.</v>

2455
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.273
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

2456
01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.590
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to make assumptions.</v>

2457
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2458
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.510
<v Speaker 2>And operate off assumptions.</v>

2459
01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:01.190
<v Speaker 2>But eventuallY you start getting off so crazy and you know how many assumptions</v>

2460
01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:02.480
<v Speaker 2>are going to believe until you believe in the moon.</v>

2461
01:01:02.481 --> 01:01:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Landing was fake.</v>

2462
01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this though.</v>

2463
01:01:04.131 --> 01:01:08.780
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that some people do that and they do it because they're making</v>

2464
01:01:08.781 --> 01:01:09.770
<v Speaker 2>the symbol for white power?</v>

2465
01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Some as in what?</v>

2466
01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:12.081
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

2467
01:01:12.081 --> 01:01:12.501
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>

2468
01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:13.334
<v Speaker 2>20?</v>

2469
01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:13.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2470
01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:15.230
<v Speaker 2>I think I don't know about.</v>

2471
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.981
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

2472
01:01:15.981 --> 01:01:16.251
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2473
01:01:16.251 --> 01:01:17.084
<v Speaker 2>nothing's absolute.</v>

2474
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.570
<v Speaker 2>I'd be.</v>

2475
01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:20.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure they're probably some white supremacists who do that.</v>

2476
01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2477
01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:21.613
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing.</v>

2478
01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Most of these people who are on four,</v>

2479
01:01:23.601 --> 01:01:24.320
<v Speaker 2>chan,</v>

2480
01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.140
<v Speaker 2>who would even use the emoji who would do it in public,</v>

2481
01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:29.300
<v Speaker 2>they're not doing it to signal white power.</v>

2482
01:01:29.301 --> 01:01:34.160
<v Speaker 2>They're doing it as signal opposition to the tribal left when they take photos</v>

2483
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:37.730
<v Speaker 2>and you see someone like kasandra fairbank's who is a trump supporting,</v>

2484
01:01:37.731 --> 01:01:38.564
<v Speaker 2>you know writer.</v>

2485
01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:39.240
<v Speaker 2>She has.</v>

2486
01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:39.420
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

2487
01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:39.800
<v Speaker 2>she is.</v>

2488
01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.020
<v Speaker 2>She is notable because she stood at the podium,</v>

2489
01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:46.190
<v Speaker 2>made the okay hanson and then this writer from splinter news,</v>

2490
01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.260
<v Speaker 2>which used to be called fusion.</v>

2491
01:01:48.261 --> 01:01:48.621
<v Speaker 2>I worked there,</v>

2492
01:01:48.621 --> 01:01:49.454
<v Speaker 2>full disclosure,</v>

2493
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:53.960
<v Speaker 2>claimed it was a white power hand gesture and she got a cassandra sued over it.</v>

2494
01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:57.880
<v Speaker 2>She ultimately lOst because it's like free slander is hard to sue for,</v>

2495
01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:00.590
<v Speaker 2>but she did it because it was a trump sign,</v>

2496
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:01.670
<v Speaker 2>not because it's white power.</v>

2497
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:06.080
<v Speaker 2>So the people who were even white supremacists aren't signifying white power.</v>

2498
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.000
<v Speaker 2>They're signAling to other trump supporters too,</v>

2499
01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:08.511
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2500
01:02:08.511 --> 01:02:09.680
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean white power.</v>

2501
01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:10.401
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2502
01:02:10.401 --> 01:02:13.610
<v Speaker 2>So just because someone on the left says it means white power.</v>

2503
01:02:13.611 --> 01:02:15.890
<v Speaker 2>That does not mean it means why power within their group.</v>

2504
01:02:15.891 --> 01:02:16.724
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're saying?</v>

2505
01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:17.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2506
01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:19.860
<v Speaker 2>we all just decide that this means something else.</v>

2507
01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

2508
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>my friend means peace among peers,</v>

2509
01:02:21.811 --> 01:02:22.610

2510
01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:23.430

01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>So he would give the bird and they would call it the Michigan.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>

2525

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>And so the Michigan wave or something like that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to submit.</v>

2536
01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>His friend didn't know this.</v>

2537
01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.060
<v Speaker 1>So his friend,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm not a big fan of conspiracy theories.</v>

2567
01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a big fan of making assumptions about the intentions of other people.</v>

2568
01:03:34.461 --> 01:03:35.121
<v Speaker 3>If you can prove it,</v>

2569
01:03:35.121 --> 01:03:35.954
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to hear it,</v>

2570
01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.270
<v Speaker 3>but people in this country are innocent until proven guilty.</v>

2571
01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:38.841
<v Speaker 3>What do we have?</v>

2572
01:03:38.841 --> 01:03:40.310
<v Speaker 3>We have a photo of some cops doing something dumb.</v>

2573
01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.900
<v Speaker 3>Do I think it was ill advised it was wrong and should've done.</v>

2574
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:44.270
<v Speaker 3>of course absolution have done it.</v>

2575
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:45.800
<v Speaker 3>Do I think it means they're west palm assists?</v>

2576
01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:46.663
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I've had cops kicked my door in.</v>

2590
01:03:58.940 --> 01:03:59.773
<v Speaker 3>Guns drawn.</v>

2591
01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.910
<v Speaker 3>I was in chicago and cops pulled me over.</v>

2592
01:04:02.090 --> 01:04:02.870
<v Speaker 3>Me and my buddies.</v>

2593
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:04.610
<v Speaker 3>This is all on video at gunpoint.</v>

2594
01:04:04.611 --> 01:04:05.480
<v Speaker 3>Screaming at us.</v>

2595
01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:07.370
<v Speaker 3>It was the craziest experience I've ever had.</v>

2596
01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:08.533
<v Speaker 3>I am no fan,</v>

2597
01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.490
<v Speaker 3>but if you don't have evidence,</v>

2598
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:12.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm not just going to say this is a thing about how,</v>

2599
01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:13.940
<v Speaker 3>how these biases function.</v>

2600
01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:15.980
<v Speaker 3>You get people who will see all these videos,</v>

2601
01:04:15.981 --> 01:04:18.230
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these experiences and they immediately assume the worst about these</v>

2602
01:04:18.231 --> 01:04:18.760
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

2603
01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:19.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything about these guys.</v>

2604
01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:21.110
<v Speaker 3>I know they did something dumb,</v>

2605
01:04:21.111 --> 01:04:21.944
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know why.</v>

2606
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:25.610
<v Speaker 3>So I can't really go beyond that other than I believe their official statement</v>

2607
01:04:25.611 --> 01:04:26.480
<v Speaker 3>was there playing the game,</v>

2608
01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:28.590
<v Speaker 3>but I could be wrong but to,</v>

2609
01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:31.340
<v Speaker 3>to make assumptions about their character or what they believe simply because</v>

2610
01:04:31.341 --> 01:04:32.720
<v Speaker 3>they made an okay sign on their leg.</v>

2611
01:04:32.721 --> 01:04:35.630
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can't convict somebody in a court.</v>

2612
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:36.763
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2613
01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:37.651
<v Speaker 3>And I'm,</v>

2614
01:04:37.651 --> 01:04:41.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of the presumption of innocence and blackstone's formulation and</v>

2615
01:04:41.691 --> 01:04:42.950
<v Speaker 3>how we side on the,</v>

2616
01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:43.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2617
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:43.260
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2618
01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.780
<v Speaker 3>we err on the side of protecting the innocent.</v>

2619
01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I think you got a good point in also in the fact that this is a extremely recent</v>

2620
01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:55.460
<v Speaker 1>hand gesture that's being associated with white supremacy and clearly came from</v>

2621
01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.910
<v Speaker 3>and you have to assume these guys are on four chan or read these,</v>

2622
01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:00.020
<v Speaker 3>these websites like,</v>

2623
01:05:00.021 --> 01:05:00.471
<v Speaker 3>c'mon man,</v>

2624
01:05:00.471 --> 01:05:01.160
<v Speaker 3>these dudes,</v>

2625
01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.150
<v Speaker 3>they probably go to work all day.</v>

2626
01:05:02.151 --> 01:05:02.990
<v Speaker 3>They talk about football,</v>

2627
01:05:02.991 --> 01:05:03.381
<v Speaker 3>they go home,</v>

2628
01:05:03.381 --> 01:05:06.470
<v Speaker 3>they sit in their lounge chair and have a beer and a slice of pizza or whatever</v>

2629
01:05:06.471 --> 01:05:07.304
<v Speaker 3>it is they do.</v>

2630
01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:08.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't think these guys,</v>

2631
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.823
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2632
01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:10.190
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2633
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2634
01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:13.880
<v Speaker 3>people don't know how to separate their own personal bubble from reality.</v>

2635
01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:14.930
<v Speaker 3>They assume,</v>

2636
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:16.370
<v Speaker 3>if I know what you must know it,</v>

2637
01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:17.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2638
01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.393
<v Speaker 3>It's actually something</v>

2639
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.840
<v Speaker 2>shane smith told me.</v>

2640
01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:20.531
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2641
01:05:20.531 --> 01:05:21.520
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't understand.</v>

2642
01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that if he can do it,</v>

2643
01:05:23.351 --> 01:05:24.490
<v Speaker 2>you can't write,</v>

2644
01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:27.620
<v Speaker 2>and that's an interesting point that people don't seem to realize.</v>

2645
01:05:27.621 --> 01:05:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Do you mean by that?</v>

2646
01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:28.891
<v Speaker 2>LIke he's,</v>

2647
01:05:28.891 --> 01:05:29.650
<v Speaker 2>he's had to meet.</v>

2648
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:30.281
<v Speaker 2>I can speak french.</v>

2649
01:05:30.281 --> 01:05:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Why can't you like people live in this mindset where they assume If I know it,</v>

2650
01:05:34.901 --> 01:05:37.010
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows it rides so,</v>

2651
01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:37.691
<v Speaker 2>so they're going to be like,</v>

2652
01:05:37.691 --> 01:05:37.990
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2653
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.411
<v Speaker 2>every.</v>

2654
01:05:38.411 --> 01:05:39.700
<v Speaker 2>I saw an article about that.</v>

2655
01:05:39.701 --> 01:05:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Everyone must know what it is.</v>

2656
01:05:40.841 --> 01:05:41.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2657
01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:41.181
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2658
01:05:41.181 --> 01:05:41.241
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2659
01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:41.411
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2660
01:05:41.411 --> 01:05:41.860
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2661
01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:43.390
<v Speaker 2>There are some people who don't watch tv.</v>

2662
01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:45.190
<v Speaker 2>There's some people play video games all day.</v>

2663
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:47.710
<v Speaker 2>There are some people who don't do any of that for all,</v>

2664
01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:47.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2665
01:05:47.921 --> 01:05:48.754
<v Speaker 2>these guys,</v>

2666
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.900
<v Speaker 2>they everyday after work,</v>

2667
01:05:49.901 --> 01:05:53.320
<v Speaker 2>they go to a children's shelter and provide soup and they don't watch the news</v>

2668
01:05:53.321 --> 01:05:54.130
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

2669
01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:54.311
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2670
01:05:54.311 --> 01:05:54.521
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2671
01:05:54.521 --> 01:05:55.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that they actually do.</v>

2672
01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying you have no idea what's going on in their lives.</v>

2673
01:05:57.461 --> 01:05:59.590
<v Speaker 2>you're making assumptions about what they know who they are.</v>

2674
01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:00.993
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

2675
01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:02.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2676
01:06:02.021 --> 01:06:02.171
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2677
01:06:02.171 --> 01:06:02.950
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2678
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:05.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm a firm believer that we have problems of racism in this country.</v>

2679
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I believe a institutional systemic racism,</v>

2680
01:06:07.481 --> 01:06:07.750
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

2681
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:08.890
<v Speaker 2>real problems need to be solved.</v>

2682
01:06:08.891 --> 01:06:12.910
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff that still doesn't mean you get to just label someone and make</v>

2683
01:06:12.911 --> 01:06:14.140
<v Speaker 2>assumptions about what they believe,</v>

2684
01:06:14.141 --> 01:06:17.020
<v Speaker 2>who they are because of one thing,</v>

2685
01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:17.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2686
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:17.731
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2687
01:06:17.731 --> 01:06:17.980
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2688
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:19.050
<v Speaker 2>if you'd made a,</v>

2689
01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:19.811
<v Speaker 2>if you made a joke,</v>

2690
01:06:19.811 --> 01:06:20.050
<v Speaker 2>what if,</v>

2691
01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:22.240
<v Speaker 2>what if they did it because they were ironically doing it right?</v>

2692
01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.650
<v Speaker 2>If you made a job 10 years ago,</v>

2693
01:06:23.651 --> 01:06:25.330
<v Speaker 2>am I going assume you actually believed that?</v>

2694
01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:26.620
<v Speaker 2>Maybe said something silly.</v>

2695
01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:27.041
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2696
01:06:27.041 --> 01:06:28.800
<v Speaker 2>we had this newscaster in New York who,</v>

2697
01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:31.420
<v Speaker 2>who accidentally said martin luther,</v>

2698
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2699
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:33.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2700
01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:33.790
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2701
01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:34.080
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2702
01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.050
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

2703
01:06:35.051 --> 01:06:35.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2704
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:36.310
<v Speaker 2>another one.</v>

2705
01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:36.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2706
01:06:36.401 --> 01:06:36.970
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2707
01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:37.570
<v Speaker 2>And you also,</v>

2708
01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:37.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2709
01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:41.800
<v Speaker 2>and another thing happened that no one cared about was a guy on cnn said a</v>

2710
01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:44.230
<v Speaker 2>racial slur for jewish people in the same way.</v>

2711
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:45.910
<v Speaker 2>No one cared about that one,</v>

2712
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:47.223
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2713
01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.430
<v Speaker 2>So there was a cnn anchor.</v>

2714
01:06:48.490 --> 01:06:49.323
<v Speaker 2>What did he say?</v>

2715
01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:50.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say it.</v>

2716
01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2717
01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:51.260
<v Speaker 2>But he was,</v>

2718
01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:51.570
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

2719
01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:51.940
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

2720
01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:52.830
<v Speaker 2>he's k word,</v>

2721
01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:53.693
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2722
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.140
<v Speaker 2>I think you can still say it as long as I'm not calling me.</v>

2723
01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:56.921
<v Speaker 2>It was the same thing.</v>

2724
01:06:56.921 --> 01:06:57.940
<v Speaker 2>He quickly fit,</v>

2725
01:06:57.941 --> 01:07:00.490
<v Speaker 2>corrected himself and that didn't come up as an issue.</v>

2726
01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:02.050
<v Speaker 2>But the point is this,</v>

2727
01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:02.620
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2728
01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:03.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2729
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:03.770
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

2730
01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:04.603
<v Speaker 2>Why is he being fired?</v>

2731
01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2732
01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.460
<v Speaker 2>Even people came to his defense,</v>

2733
01:07:06.461 --> 01:07:08.290
<v Speaker 2>are you going to assume nasty things about them?</v>

2734
01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:08.801
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2735
01:07:08.801 --> 01:07:11.590
<v Speaker 2>are we really getting to the point where we're gonna look at a photo.</v>

2736
01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:12.760
<v Speaker 2>We don't know the context.</v>

2737
01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.800
<v Speaker 2>We don't know who these people are wanting to know their names and we're going</v>

2738
01:07:14.801 --> 01:07:16.030
<v Speaker 2>to be a light burned at the stake.</v>

2739
01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:16.241
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2740
01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:17.290
<v Speaker 2>there's another issue too,</v>

2741
01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:18.730
<v Speaker 2>and this is what we're doing it.</v>

2742
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:19.743
<v Speaker 2>Oh jesus.</v>

2743
01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.040
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

2744
01:07:21.310 --> 01:07:21.930
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even.</v>

2745
01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:22.870
<v Speaker 2>I meant to do this,</v>

2746
01:07:23.110 --> 01:07:27.610
<v Speaker 2>but there is another issue that people do accidentally like because they're</v>

2747
01:07:27.611 --> 01:07:28.840
<v Speaker 2>worried about saying something.</v>

2748
01:07:28.841 --> 01:07:29.660
<v Speaker 2>They will say something.</v>

2749
01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2750
01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.760
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend and he was a warmup,</v>

2751
01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.020
<v Speaker 2>a guy for a television show.</v>

2752
01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how a warmup works?</v>

2753
01:07:36.971 --> 01:07:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a save a sitcoms being filmed.</v>

2754
01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.380
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy who will keep the crowd laughing.</v>

2755
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2756
01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:44.890
<v Speaker 2>He walks around to keep the crown and he had an anxiety attack.</v>

2757
01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:47.350
<v Speaker 2>He had a panic attack in the panic attack was this.</v>

2758
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:51.850
<v Speaker 2>He was doing the cosby show and he was,</v>

2759
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.050
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

2760
01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:54.340
<v Speaker 2>it got into his head.</v>

2761
01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Don't say the n Word,</v>

2762
01:07:56.830 --> 01:07:57.700
<v Speaker 2>don't say it,</v>

2763
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:58.661
<v Speaker 2>don't say it.</v>

2764
01:07:58.661 --> 01:08:02.260
<v Speaker 2>And he started sweating and he said he started stammering and he literally</v>

2765
01:08:02.261 --> 01:08:03.130
<v Speaker 2>couldn't talk.</v>

2766
01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:08.370
<v Speaker 2>He had some anxiety issues and and he locked up and literally couldn't.</v>

2767
01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Could barely say it.</v>

2768
01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Did he?</v>

2769
01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:12.701
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2770
01:08:12.701 --> 01:08:13.281
<v Speaker 2>he didn't say it,</v>

2771
01:08:13.281 --> 01:08:14.920
<v Speaker 2>but he was terrified that he was going to say it's,</v>

2772
01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:19.280
<v Speaker 2>but that could be what's going on with someone saying martin luther coon,</v>

2773
01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.900
<v Speaker 2>like especially the second guy,</v>

2774
01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:23.390
<v Speaker 2>obviously with context.</v>

2775
01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Obviously the second guy heard the first guy do it and it was a freudian slip.</v>

2776
01:08:27.651 --> 01:08:28.484
<v Speaker 2>It's in his mind.</v>

2777
01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:29.481
<v Speaker 2>Don't say it.</v>

2778
01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:30.231
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you do,</v>

2779
01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:31.190
<v Speaker 2>don't say that.</v>

2780
01:08:31.191 --> 01:08:32.030
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you in on a funny,</v>

2781
01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:33.170
<v Speaker 2>funny little secret though.</v>

2782
01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Ice.</v>

2783
01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.290
<v Speaker 2>I did it in one of my videos.</v>

2784
01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:38.900
<v Speaker 2>You said that and then I started laughing.</v>

2785
01:08:38.901 --> 01:08:39.570
<v Speaker 2>It was about,</v>

2786
01:08:39.570 --> 01:08:40.403
<v Speaker 2>it was about it.</v>

2787
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:41.570
<v Speaker 2>It was about the guy.</v>

2788
01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:45.190
<v Speaker 2>It was about the story and so you said it and I said it laughed and I just</v>

2789
01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:46.520
<v Speaker 2>decided that I had at my videos,</v>

2790
01:08:46.521 --> 01:08:46.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2791
01:08:46.641 --> 01:08:47.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it.</v>

2792
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:48.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't do live shots,</v>

2793
01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:49.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2794
01:08:49.341 --> 01:08:50.240
<v Speaker 2>I do a lot sometimes,</v>

2795
01:08:50.241 --> 01:08:51.074
<v Speaker 2>but I was just like,</v>

2796
01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:51.470
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2797
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:52.191
<v Speaker 2>I started laughing.</v>

2798
01:08:52.191 --> 01:08:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I just literally just started laughing and I'm like,</v>

2799
01:08:54.650 --> 01:08:58.280
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it because the story was about him saying it.</v>

2800
01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:02.120
<v Speaker 2>I purposefully don't say these words on youtube because I don't want to get the</v>

2801
01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:03.110
<v Speaker 2>banhammer sure.</v>

2802
01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:03.681
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

2803
01:09:03.681 --> 01:09:08.060
<v Speaker 2>this guy accidentally said martin luther and then he used a slur and then later</v>

2804
01:09:08.061 --> 01:09:08.661
<v Speaker 2>when I was reading it,</v>

2805
01:09:08.661 --> 01:09:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I said it and I started laughing.</v>

2806
01:09:09.651 --> 01:09:10.484
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

2807
01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:11.210
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2808
01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:14.310
<v Speaker 2>I understand what it's not even about saying this.</v>

2809
01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Alerts about when you have two words in your head and you accidentally put them</v>

2810
01:09:17.091 --> 01:09:17.450
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

2811
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2812
01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:18.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2813
01:09:18.310 --> 01:09:18.771
<v Speaker 2>that's what happened.</v>

2814
01:09:18.771 --> 01:09:19.430
<v Speaker 2>The cnn guy.</v>

2815
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Well sometimes I call someone the wrong name and don't realize I've done it</v>

2816
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:22.820
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2817
01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Like jamie said,</v>

2818
01:09:23.721 --> 01:09:24.620
<v Speaker 2>you said jack.</v>

2819
01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:25.191
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2820
01:09:25.191 --> 01:09:25.990
<v Speaker 2>I thought I said john,</v>

2821
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:27.750
<v Speaker 2>like we've had that conversation before.</v>

2822
01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.770
<v Speaker 2>I literally in my head think I'm saying the right thing,</v>

2823
01:09:30.771 --> 01:09:31.604
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not.</v>

2824
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:31.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2825
01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:32.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2826
01:09:32.181 --> 01:09:32.371
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2827
01:09:32.371 --> 01:09:33.350
<v Speaker 2>I made a huge,</v>

2828
01:09:33.351 --> 01:09:35.060
<v Speaker 2>huge mistake on one of my videos.</v>

2829
01:09:35.061 --> 01:09:38.510
<v Speaker 2>I deleted the video because of it because instead of saying harvey weinstein,</v>

2830
01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:39.021
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2831
01:09:39.021 --> 01:09:39.854
<v Speaker 2>brett,</v>

2832
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:40.760
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>

2833
01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.410
<v Speaker 2>And brett's awesome brett.</v>

2834
01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:43.071
<v Speaker 2>Such a cool dude.</v>

2835
01:09:43.071 --> 01:09:43.904
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan.</v>

2836
01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.240
<v Speaker 2>And I published a video and someone messaged me and they were like,</v>

2837
01:09:47.241 --> 01:09:49.010
<v Speaker 2>just want to let you know you made this big mistake.</v>

2838
01:09:49.011 --> 01:09:51.530
<v Speaker 2>And I had some pretty awful things and I felt so bad.</v>

2839
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.030
<v Speaker 2>I think I've done similar.</v>

2840
01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:53.511
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2841
01:09:53.511 --> 01:09:54.231
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

2842
01:09:54.231 --> 01:09:54.650
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2843
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:55.041
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2844
01:09:55.041 --> 01:09:56.090
<v Speaker 2>that guy is so cool.</v>

2845
01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm a big fan of his work.</v>

2846
01:09:58.100 --> 01:09:58.933
<v Speaker 2>I just was like,</v>

2847
01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.200
<v Speaker 2>I tried editing it and I'm like,</v>

2848
01:10:00.201 --> 01:10:01.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm bleeding it hands down.</v>

2849
01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:01.550
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

2850
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:04.190
<v Speaker 2>I would rather just remove the video outright than to say a disparaging word</v>

2851
01:10:04.191 --> 01:10:05.024
<v Speaker 2>against that man.</v>

2852
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:06.223
<v Speaker 2>And I was an accident.</v>

2853
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:07.311
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even.</v>

2854
01:10:07.311 --> 01:10:08.240
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know I said it.</v>

2855
01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.280
<v Speaker 2>I think I did the exact same thing.</v>

2856
01:10:10.281 --> 01:10:11.360
<v Speaker 2>I did the exact same thing,</v>

2857
01:10:11.361 --> 01:10:15.080
<v Speaker 2>I believe on stage once because I had a bit about harvey weinstein.</v>

2858
01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:16.460
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2859
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:17.323
<v Speaker 2>brett,</v>

2860
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:19.490
<v Speaker 2>I think I said it onto fortunate.</v>

2861
01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2862
01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:21.500
<v Speaker 2>because they're polar opposites.</v>

2863
01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2864
01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:22.613
<v Speaker 2>Brett's fantastic.</v>

2865
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:22.821
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2866
01:10:22.821 --> 01:10:24.590
<v Speaker 2>he's actually weinstein,</v>

2867
01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:24.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2868
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:25.790
<v Speaker 2>So that Will help.</v>

2869
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2870
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Say stein instead of 18 for heartbeat.</v>

2871
01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:30.070
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2872
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.560
<v Speaker 2>for brett,</v>

2873
01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.930
<v Speaker 2>for brent and eric weinstein.</v>

2874
01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:33.853
<v Speaker 2>Weinstein,</v>

2875
01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.210
<v Speaker 2>harvey weinstein,</v>

2876

<v Speaker 2>bret weinstein.</v>

2877
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.680
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>

2878
01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.580
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know I did it spelled the second I,</v>

2879
01:10:38.581 --> 01:10:39.610
<v Speaker 2>I edited the video.</v>

2880
01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:39.970
<v Speaker 2>I edit,</v>

2881
01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:40.701
<v Speaker 2>I edit.</v>

2882
01:10:40.701 --> 01:10:41.534
<v Speaker 2>I published it,</v>

2883
01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:43.610
<v Speaker 2>and then I started getting messages from people and I was like,</v>

2884
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:44.623
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2885
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:45.740
<v Speaker 2>And then I watched the that.</v>

2886
01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2890
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:52.580
<v Speaker 2>like when you're Thinking and talking at the same time,</v>

2891
01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:55.370
<v Speaker 2>there'S a bunch of words bouncing around in your head and you're just trying to.</v>

2892
01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:59.410
<v Speaker 2>And you think you're saying the right thing when you know it's.</v>

2893
01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.520
<v Speaker 2>That's why intent so critical.</v>

2894
01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:02.300
<v Speaker 2>George carlin.</v>

2895

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2896
01:11:02.601 --> 01:11:05.090
<v Speaker 2>And magic words are so fucking dangerous,</v>

2899
01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:08.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2900
01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.720
<v Speaker 2>You know about a specific comedian that we know and love.</v>

2901
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:12.321
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2902
01:11:12.321 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 2>george carlin was</v>

2903
01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:15.930
<v Speaker 3>absolutely amazing.</v>

2904
01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:16.171
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2905
01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:16.520
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>

2906
01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.210
<v Speaker 1>He not only was he absolutely amazing,</v>

2907
01:11:18.211 --> 01:11:19.580
<v Speaker 1>but people don't have to you.</v>

2908
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:24.750
<v Speaker 1>You almost have to have lived during the time where he was getting arrested just</v>

2909
01:11:25.090 --> 01:11:27.030
<v Speaker 1>much like lenny bruce before him,</v>

2910
01:11:27.031 --> 01:11:31.260
<v Speaker 1>but to understand how significant he was when he was doing that seven dirty</v>

2911
01:11:31.261 --> 01:11:31.501
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

2912
01:11:31.501 --> 01:11:32.640
<v Speaker 1>you can't say on television,</v>

2913
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:34.740
<v Speaker 1>like back then people were like,</v>

2914
01:11:34.741 --> 01:11:36.870
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this guy doing?</v>

2915
01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:40.980
<v Speaker 3>It was groundbreaking when he did a,</v>

2916
01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.520
<v Speaker 3>I think it was in [inaudible] 92.</v>

2917
01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:43.713
<v Speaker 3>He did that bit.</v>

2918
01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:48.040
<v Speaker 3>We probably did it a lot where he basically ran off 50 racial slurs and then</v>

2919
01:11:48.041 --> 01:11:50.590
<v Speaker 3>actually called eddie murphy and richard pryor the n word.</v>

2920
01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:51.941
<v Speaker 3>Remember that school?</v>

2921
01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:52.870
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2922
01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.370
<v Speaker 3>and everyone laughed.</v>

2923
01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2924
01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Everyone left because they understood his intent.</v>

2925
01:11:57.550 --> 01:11:59.530
<v Speaker 3>They understood that he didn't actually disrespect them.</v>

2926
01:11:59.531 --> 01:12:00.101
<v Speaker 3>They understood that.</v>

2927
01:12:00.101 --> 01:12:01.360
<v Speaker 3>He didn't mean anything bad about it.</v>

2928
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:06.070
<v Speaker 3>He was making a point about the the racist asshole behind the words,</v>

2929
01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:07.420
<v Speaker 3>and it's funny to me.</v>

2930
01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:08.231
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing,</v>

2931

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.293
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

2942
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:20.470
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to think of.</v>

2943
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:21.071
<v Speaker 3>It's been so long.</v>

2944
01:12:21.071 --> 01:12:24.850
<v Speaker 3>I'll try to think of some of the band shirts we used to have and a man we were.</v>

2945
01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:27.160
<v Speaker 3>We were angry and pissed off all the time.</v>

2946
01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:30.400
<v Speaker 3>I grew up like that and then over time I learned I.</v>

2947
01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:32.320
<v Speaker 3>I went through a ton of really important life lessons.</v>

2948
01:12:32.530 --> 01:12:36.010
<v Speaker 3>One of the first and most important was I was a young skateboarder in chicago.</v>

2949
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Really looked up to some of these,</v>

2950
01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:38.470
<v Speaker 3>these older guys who were really good.</v>

2951
01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.720
<v Speaker 3>I went to catholic school when I was younger.</v>

2952
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I ended up becoming this punk rocker guitar playing far left skin tight,</v>

2953
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2974
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.823
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

2975
01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:03.221
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2976
01:13:03.221 --> 01:13:05.670
<v Speaker 3>I just thought like a story about a dude travel around helping people was kind</v>

2977
01:13:05.671 --> 01:13:06.504
<v Speaker 3>of cool.</v>

2978
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:07.383
<v Speaker 3>And I went,</v>

2979
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.441
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2980
01:13:08.441 --> 01:13:09.274
<v Speaker 3>that's a good point.</v>

2981
01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:10.210
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2982
01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:10.630
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

2983
01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:11.463
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2984
01:13:11.890 --> 01:13:12.191
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2985
01:13:12.191 --> 01:13:12.371
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2986
01:13:12.371 --> 01:13:13.690
<v Speaker 3>maybe I don't really understand.</v>

2987
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:16.600
<v Speaker 3>Maybe maybe this means something different to other people.</v>

2988
01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:17.530
<v Speaker 3>That means to me,</v>

2989
01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:17.931
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2990
01:13:17.931 --> 01:13:22.540
<v Speaker 1>if jesus was an indian man that had wooden beads and you know,</v>

2991
01:13:22.541 --> 01:13:24.740
<v Speaker 1>in he was a hindu god,</v>

2992
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:26.210
<v Speaker 1>we would love him.</v>

2993
01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:26.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2994
01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:28.310
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like shiva or vishnu.</v>

2995
01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:28.701
<v Speaker 1>We would,</v>

2996
01:13:28.701 --> 01:13:30.440
<v Speaker 1>we would think he's the most amazing thing ever.</v>

2997
01:13:30.441 --> 01:13:35.060
<v Speaker 1>It's the fact that if you look at what jesus preached and what he was all about,</v>

2998
01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:35.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2999
01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:36.471
<v Speaker 1>seems pretty rad.</v>

3000
01:13:36.471 --> 01:13:41.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it's about as spiritual and loving and it's,</v>

3001
01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:41.931
<v Speaker 1>it's about,</v>

3002
01:13:41.931 --> 01:13:42.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

3003
01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:43.130
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

3004
01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:48.130
<v Speaker 1>his whole ideology that the jesus of the bible and he was essentially about</v>

3005
01:13:48.710 --> 01:13:52.370
<v Speaker 1>loving your brother and treating people as if they're you and,</v>

3006
01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:53.190
<v Speaker 3>but this,</v>

3007
01:13:53.190 --> 01:13:53.771
<v Speaker 3>this for me,</v>

3008
01:13:53.771 --> 01:13:57.040
<v Speaker 3>like I bring this up because it was kind of a formative moment where all of a</v>

3009
01:13:57.041 --> 01:14:02.041
<v Speaker 3>sudden I realized was my ideology predicated on assumptions was I was I holding</v>

3010
01:14:02.831 --> 01:14:04.930
<v Speaker 3>these views because other people told me to hold them,</v>

3011
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:08.170
<v Speaker 3>that actually understand that there were some positive things on the other side.</v>

3012
01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:11.560
<v Speaker 3>And then I slowly moved over to more of a center left position.</v>

3013
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:13.450
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3014
01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:15.430
<v Speaker 3>now what the reason I bring this up.</v>

3015
01:14:15.431 --> 01:14:16.930
<v Speaker 3>as I looked,</v>

3016
01:14:16.931 --> 01:14:17.741
<v Speaker 3>I watched that video.</v>

3017
01:14:17.741 --> 01:14:18.371
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted this,</v>

3018
01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:19.660
<v Speaker 3>the video of george carlin [inaudible] man.</v>

3019
01:14:19.661 --> 01:14:20.291
<v Speaker 3>George carlin was,</v>

3020
01:14:20.291 --> 01:14:20.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3021
01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:21.990
<v Speaker 3>I used to watch this video was my,</v>

3022
01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:22.240
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

3023
01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.030
<v Speaker 3>my mom would put them on and my mom's been a hippie liberal,</v>

3024
01:14:25.031 --> 01:14:25.571
<v Speaker 3>far left,</v>

3025
01:14:25.571 --> 01:14:28.420
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff and you'd probably consider a conservative by today's,</v>

3026
01:14:28.650 --> 01:14:29.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3027
01:14:29.130 --> 01:14:30.340
<v Speaker 3>measures the way things have been going.</v>

3028
01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:31.990
<v Speaker 3>Now they look at,</v>

3029
01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:32.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3030
01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:33.063
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Hart,</v>

3031
01:14:33.190 --> 01:14:34.570
<v Speaker 3>he's had a bad joke 10 years ago.</v>

3032
01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:36.013
<v Speaker 3>Get 'em out.</v>

3033
01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:36.490
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3034
01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:37.323
<v Speaker 3>could you imagine?</v>

3035
01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:37.631
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3036
01:14:37.631 --> 01:14:37.780
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3037
01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.090
<v Speaker 3>god forbid what would happen with george carlin's routines today?</v>

3038
01:14:40.091 --> 01:14:40.440
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't,</v>

3039
01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:40.571
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3040
01:14:40.571 --> 01:14:42.580
<v Speaker 3>they would be running all of his old routine saying,</v>

3041
01:14:42.581 --> 01:14:42.911
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3042
01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:44.250
<v Speaker 3>you have to ban him from the show.</v>

3043
01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:46.240
<v Speaker 3>he literally called these people the n word.</v>

3044
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Why was it that george carlin can go on stage and talk about how republicans</v>

3045
01:14:49.811 --> 01:14:50.290
<v Speaker 3>were dominant,</v>

3046
01:14:50.290 --> 01:14:51.730
<v Speaker 3>how religion is crazy.</v>

3047
01:14:51.850 --> 01:14:56.110
<v Speaker 3>He was clearly on the left his whole life and he said these things that by</v>

3048
01:14:56.111 --> 01:14:58.330
<v Speaker 3>today's standards would be considered conservative.</v>

3049
01:14:59.080 --> 01:14:59.381
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3050
01:14:59.381 --> 01:15:03.510
<v Speaker 3>And so for me it's a weird thing to go from being on the far left as a,</v>

3051
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:04.231
<v Speaker 3>as a young person.</v>

3052
01:15:04.231 --> 01:15:05.350
<v Speaker 3>It was around like 19 or 20.</v>

3053
01:15:05.351 --> 01:15:09.370
<v Speaker 3>I started to become more moderate and then to see them today being extremely</v>

3054
01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:11.740
<v Speaker 3>offended like people used to be in the fifties and sixties,</v>

3055
01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:13.300
<v Speaker 3>like that's regressive,</v>

3056
01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:16.570
<v Speaker 3>that's trying to bring things back to the way they used to be with offensive,</v>

3057
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:20.350
<v Speaker 3>nothing on puritanism and all these things and now I feel like,</v>

3058
01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:23.770
<v Speaker 3>I guess the cliche is the modern,</v>

3059
01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:24.670
<v Speaker 3>the modern left,</v>

3060
01:15:24.671 --> 01:15:25.321
<v Speaker 3>whatever people call it,</v>

3061
01:15:25.321 --> 01:15:30.321
<v Speaker 3>like the capital l tribal left seems to be being indoctrinated not by leftwing</v>

3062
01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:31.630
<v Speaker 3>policy ideas.</v>

3063
01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:33.550
<v Speaker 3>It's not about necessarily socialism,</v>

3064
01:15:33.551 --> 01:15:34.900
<v Speaker 3>it's about identitarianism.</v>

3065
01:15:34.901 --> 01:15:39.480
<v Speaker 3>It's about policy based on your immutable characteristics and how you know,</v>

3066
01:15:39.481 --> 01:15:41.050
<v Speaker 3>like going back to the green new deal,</v>

3067
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:44.010
<v Speaker 3>like in the bill it talks about racial equity.</v>

3068
01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:45.250
<v Speaker 3>What does that do to the environment,</v>

3069
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:46.103
<v Speaker 3>but what does that mean?</v>

3070
01:15:47.850 --> 01:15:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3071
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:49.970
<v Speaker 3>equality would be like you,</v>

3072
01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:51.430
<v Speaker 3>you equal opportunity to.</v>

3073
01:15:51.431 --> 01:15:53.380
<v Speaker 3>People are allowed to try and if one succeeds,</v>

3074
01:15:53.381 --> 01:15:54.190
<v Speaker 3>congratulations,</v>

3075
01:15:54.190 --> 01:15:55.570
<v Speaker 3>equity would be well,</v>

3076
01:15:55.571 --> 01:16:00.160
<v Speaker 3>let's determine whether or not you are advantaged or privileged and then hold</v>

3077
01:16:00.161 --> 01:16:01.900
<v Speaker 3>you back or push you forward based on these,</v>

3078
01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:04.030
<v Speaker 3>these certain metrics.</v>

3079
01:16:04.031 --> 01:16:05.310
<v Speaker 3>I suppose it's,</v>

3080
01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.260
<v Speaker 3>it's the problem I have with it is that it's not quantifiable.</v>

3081
01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:10.840
<v Speaker 3>so this was actually something that was really shocking to me.</v>

3082
01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:12.580
<v Speaker 3>I was siTting with my niece,</v>

3083
01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:13.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3084
01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:13.750
<v Speaker 3>and my,</v>

3085
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:14.321
<v Speaker 3>my sister,</v>

3086
01:16:14.321 --> 01:16:17.650
<v Speaker 3>my niece and my mom and I showed this image that people like to share.</v>

3087
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:20.380
<v Speaker 3>It's three people standing up by a baseball,</v>

3088
01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.353
<v Speaker 3>a fence,</v>

3089
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:22.090
<v Speaker 3>and there's a,</v>

3090
01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:24.970
<v Speaker 3>there's a baseball game as a really short person who can't see.</v>

3091
01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.510
<v Speaker 3>There is a medium sized person who can see a little bit and a very tall person</v>

3092
01:16:28.511 --> 01:16:29.950
<v Speaker 3>who just stands right up above the fence.</v>

3093
01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:31.750
<v Speaker 3>It says this is equality.</v>

3094
01:16:31.810 --> 01:16:33.040
<v Speaker 3>Each of them gets one crate,</v>

3095
01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:36.760
<v Speaker 3>one crate isn't enough for the short guy and the two guys can already see that</v>

3096
01:16:36.761 --> 01:16:38.470
<v Speaker 3>says this is equity.</v>

3097
01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:39.910
<v Speaker 3>And it shows the short guy getting,</v>

3098
01:16:39.911 --> 01:16:40.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3099
01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.980
<v Speaker 3>three crates so they can all see now.</v>

3100
01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:42.791
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

3101
01:16:42.791 --> 01:16:45.220
<v Speaker 3>the problem is when it comes to someone's height,</v>

3102
01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:46.570
<v Speaker 3>sure we can understand,</v>

3103
01:16:46.571 --> 01:16:46.930
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

3104
01:16:46.930 --> 01:16:47.220
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

3105
01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:50.050
<v Speaker 3>let's give the crates to the short guy so he can see along with us.</v>

3106
01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:54.290
<v Speaker 3>But how do you determine equity based on the color of someone's skin or their,</v>

3107
01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:54.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3108
01:16:54.650 --> 01:16:56.950
<v Speaker 3>like characteristics that can't necessarily be quantified.</v>

3109
01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:58.240
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3110
01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.720
<v Speaker 3>So when alexandria ocozzio cortez pushes a bill ford that's purporting to be</v>

3111
01:17:01.721 --> 01:17:02.471
<v Speaker 3>about the environment,</v>

3112
01:17:02.471 --> 01:17:04.510
<v Speaker 3>but includes racial equity clauses,</v>

3113
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:09.620
<v Speaker 3>are we to assume that her ideology states that if you are not white are poor by</v>

3114
01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:14.060
<v Speaker 3>like it's a guarantee or do we have to assume that each individual has different</v>

3115
01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:15.141
<v Speaker 3>advantages,</v>

3116
01:17:15.141 --> 01:17:17.000
<v Speaker 3>different cards to play and some are born wealthy,</v>

3117
01:17:17.001 --> 01:17:17.720
<v Speaker 3>some aren't.</v>

3118
01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.171
<v Speaker 3>And yes,</v>

3119
01:17:18.171 --> 01:17:19.040
<v Speaker 3>there's historic racism,</v>

3120
01:17:19.041 --> 01:17:20.270
<v Speaker 3>but We can't make those assumptions.</v>

3121
01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:20.630
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3122
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:21.410
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3123
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:22.040
<v Speaker 3>So this is,</v>

3124
01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:22.311
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

3125
01:17:22.311 --> 01:17:25.550
<v Speaker 3>to me one of the biggest problems I've been having as like a lifelong</v>

3126
01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:27.920
<v Speaker 3>left-leaning individuals who do I vote for it?</v>

3127
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:28.671
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3128
01:17:28.671 --> 01:17:30.290
<v Speaker 3>I was a big fan of bernie sanders for awhile,</v>

3129
01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.990
<v Speaker 3>but then bernie sanders gets up on stage at the debates and says,</v>

3130
01:17:33.230 --> 01:17:35.000
<v Speaker 3>white people don't know what it's like to be poor.</v>

3131
01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:36.133
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3132
01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:37.273
<v Speaker 3>that's hilarious.</v>

3133
01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:40.100
<v Speaker 3>That is to go to fucking West Virginia and visit the coal miners.</v>

3134
01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:40.610
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3135
01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:42.290
<v Speaker 3>And you know what's really weird?</v>

3136
01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.170
<v Speaker 3>I saw one of bernie's tweets that I looked at it.</v>

3137
01:17:45.171 --> 01:17:45.500
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3138
01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:45.681
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3139
01:17:45.681 --> 01:17:46.371
<v Speaker 3>come on man,</v>

3140
01:17:46.371 --> 01:17:46.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3141
01:17:46.881 --> 01:17:47.720
<v Speaker 3>this is fucked up.</v>

3142
01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:53.020
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about how much more money white men make than black women.</v>

3143
01:17:53.661 --> 01:17:57.200
<v Speaker 3>And latino men and all these different things and what he didn't include was</v>

3144
01:17:57.201 --> 01:18:00.320
<v Speaker 3>asian men or asian men make more money.</v>

3145
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:02.570
<v Speaker 3>But here's what I think a lot of people on the right miss.</v>

3146
01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:03.590
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

3147
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:04.423
<v Speaker 3>pay equity,</v>

3148
01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:05.720
<v Speaker 3>not pay equality.</v>

3149
01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:06.650
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3150
01:18:06.650 --> 01:18:09.770
<v Speaker 3>I think perhaps we should stop assuming they don't know what they're saying</v>

3151
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:12.260
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of people assume what they're saying is,</v>

3152
01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:12.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3153
01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:13.730
<v Speaker 3>the gender,</v>

3154
01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:15.870
<v Speaker 3>the gender earnings gap is,</v>

3155
01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:17.030
<v Speaker 3>is real,</v>

3156
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:18.200
<v Speaker 3>but the gender pay gap,</v>

3157
01:18:18.970 --> 01:18:23.970
<v Speaker 3>it's not that if a man and a woman are both offered the exact same job,</v>

3158
01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:26.210
<v Speaker 3>exact same experience and education,</v>

3159
01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:27.230
<v Speaker 3>women tend to get.</v>

3160
01:18:27.230 --> 01:18:30.500
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like three to five percent less and many people believe that's</v>

3161
01:18:30.501 --> 01:18:32.210
<v Speaker 3>because they are less likely to negotiate.</v>

3162
01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:34.740
<v Speaker 3>WhIch is why you have like lean in tulum,</v>

3163
01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:35.241
<v Speaker 3>it'd be more,</v>

3164
01:18:35.241 --> 01:18:35.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3165
01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.770
<v Speaker 3>trying to be more assertive,</v>

3166
01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.430
<v Speaker 3>but it's not this 77 percent number that's.</v>

3167
01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:41.840
<v Speaker 3>But there is an earnings gap,</v>

3168
01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:42.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3169
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.020
<v Speaker 3>The median salaries of men and women are different.</v>

3170
01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.670
<v Speaker 3>So when bernie says white men make x more than these other demographics,</v>

3171
01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:50.990
<v Speaker 3>he said in his tweet,</v>

3172
01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:52.130
<v Speaker 3>pay equity,</v>

3173
01:18:52.190 --> 01:18:53.023
<v Speaker 3>not equality.</v>

3174
01:18:53.210 --> 01:18:55.760
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't want fair pay for everyone based on job.</v>

3175
01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:58.430
<v Speaker 3>He's actually saying it doesn't matter what job you have.</v>

3176
01:18:58.490 --> 01:18:59.990
<v Speaker 3>Everyone should be paid the same.</v>

3177
01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:00.740
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3178
01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:01.610
<v Speaker 3>that's nonsense.</v>

3179
01:19:01.730 --> 01:19:03.860
<v Speaker 3>But then you see what cortez releases on our website.</v>

3180
01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.150
<v Speaker 3>If you're unwilling To work,</v>

3181
01:19:05.151 --> 01:19:06.370
<v Speaker 3>they'll provide economic security.</v>

3182
01:19:06.371 --> 01:19:06.900
<v Speaker 3>They actually,</v>

3183
01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:07.220
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

3184
01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.840
<v Speaker 3>I believe they took it off the site,</v>

3185
01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:10.130
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3186
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:13.550
<v Speaker 3>But I think when they include it in the bill that they want equity,</v>

3187
01:19:13.551 --> 01:19:15.410
<v Speaker 3>not equality when they include on their website.</v>

3188
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:15.981
<v Speaker 3>If you're unwilling,</v>

3189
01:19:15.981 --> 01:19:16.580
<v Speaker 3>they'll pay you.</v>

3190
01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:17.810
<v Speaker 3>And when bernie says equity as well,</v>

3191
01:19:17.811 --> 01:19:20.870
<v Speaker 3>I think they're not talking about equality like I don't think you know,</v>

3192
01:19:20.871 --> 01:19:23.840
<v Speaker 3>the average american understands what they're actually saying is you should be</v>

3193
01:19:23.841 --> 01:19:25.220
<v Speaker 3>paid a flat rate period.</v>

3194
01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:28.490
<v Speaker 3>And when you're talking about the pay gap being different from men and women,</v>

3195
01:19:28.491 --> 01:19:29.330
<v Speaker 3>we should clarify that.</v>

3196
01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:33.140
<v Speaker 3>What you're saying essentially is that men choose different jobs and they work</v>

3197
01:19:33.141 --> 01:19:36.260
<v Speaker 3>more hours and that's the reason why they make that much more money.</v>

3198
01:19:36.261 --> 01:19:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Where at seventy seven cents On the dollar.</v>

3199
01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:37.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3200
01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:38.121
<v Speaker 3>There,</v>

3201
01:19:38.121 --> 01:19:38.771
<v Speaker 3>there was uh,</v>

3202
01:19:38.771 --> 01:19:38.980
<v Speaker 3>an,</v>

3203
01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:39.200
<v Speaker 3>an,</v>

3204
01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:43.610
<v Speaker 3>another study came out recently that said that ours worked was almost the,</v>

3205
01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:47.300
<v Speaker 3>a 100 percent of the reason why men and women earn different,</v>

3206
01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:47.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3207
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:52.280
<v Speaker 3>at a median median salary in some areas a women actually earn more than men.</v>

3208
01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:52.660
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3209
01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:53.271
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>

3210
01:19:53.271 --> 01:19:54.380
<v Speaker 3>I think seven cities.</v>

3211
01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:55.820
<v Speaker 3>I think this was on pew.</v>

3212
01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:56.170
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

3213
01:19:56.170 --> 01:19:59.120
<v Speaker 3>you fact check me if you got everybody thinks I'm wrong or whatever,</v>

3214
01:19:59.150 --> 01:19:59.541
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

3215
01:19:59.541 --> 01:20:03.110
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was seven cities were women out men by like seriously high numbers,</v>

3216
01:20:03.111 --> 01:20:04.160
<v Speaker 3>like up to 20 percent.</v>

3217
01:20:04.670 --> 01:20:08.940
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of issues when it comes to the pay gap and equality.</v>

3218
01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.610
<v Speaker 3>But without going on a tangent on that area,</v>

3219
01:20:11.611 --> 01:20:13.020
<v Speaker 3>I think what ends up happening is,</v>

3220
01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:13.351
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3221
01:20:13.351 --> 01:20:16.710
<v Speaker 3>I saw bernie's tweet and I responded to it by saying good news,</v>

3222
01:20:16.711 --> 01:20:19.590
<v Speaker 3>bernie pay equality is enshrined in law.</v>

3223
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:20.873
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

3224
01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:24.840
<v Speaker 3>I cited three examples of where it's illegal to discriminate based on gender.</v>

3225
01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:26.390
<v Speaker 3>And then someone points out to me,</v>

3226
01:20:26.391 --> 01:20:26.550
<v Speaker 3>tim,</v>

3227
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:28.500
<v Speaker 3>he didn't say quality is said equity.</v>

3228
01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:29.500
<v Speaker 3>That would imply,</v>

3229
01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:32.580
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter what job you have in a petroleum engineer should earn the same as</v>

3230
01:20:32.581 --> 01:20:33.630
<v Speaker 3>a store clerk at h and m.</v>

3231
01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:37.260
<v Speaker 3>That's equity that just because you have an advantage,</v>

3232
01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:39.750
<v Speaker 3>because if education doesn't mean you should earn more than somebody else.</v>

3233
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:40.793
<v Speaker 3>You see what I'm saying?</v>

3234
01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:41.723
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

3235
01:20:42.250 --> 01:20:44.280
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there's people that actually believed that,</v>

3236
01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:47.920
<v Speaker 1>that don't believe that we're the first of all,</v>

3237
01:20:47.921 --> 01:20:50.920
<v Speaker 1>that's going to absolutely discourage people from trying to succeed.</v>

3238
01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Why would you,</v>

3239
01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:55.720
<v Speaker 1>if you could get the same amount as the ceo of exxon as you can,</v>

3240
01:20:55.721 --> 01:20:57.880
<v Speaker 1>working at 21 forever,</v>

3241
01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.140
<v Speaker 1>forever 21 or whatever,</v>

3242
01:21:00.010 --> 01:21:00.940
<v Speaker 1>abercrombie and fitch.</v>

3243
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.990
<v Speaker 1>WhY would you,</v>

3244
01:21:02.170 --> 01:21:03.280
<v Speaker 1>why would you try hard?</v>

3245
01:21:03.281 --> 01:21:04.114
<v Speaker 1>Why would you?</v>

3246
01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Why would you succeed?</v>

3247
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Why would you excel?</v>

3248
01:21:06.850 --> 01:21:09.820
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fair to point out some people would love it.</v>

3249
01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:10.993
<v Speaker 1>What if there's no.</v>

3250
01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:12.610
<v Speaker 1>If there's no real,</v>

3251
01:21:12.670 --> 01:21:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean other than social status,</v>

3252
01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:16.240
<v Speaker 1>if there's no real positive,</v>

3253
01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:20.640
<v Speaker 3>I think social status might be one of the prime driving factors of,</v>

3254
01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:21.870
<v Speaker 3>of most people at whole.</v>

3255
01:21:21.871 --> 01:21:22.521
<v Speaker 3>No man,</v>

3256
01:21:22.521 --> 01:21:23.271
<v Speaker 3>not enough.</v>

3257
01:21:23.271 --> 01:21:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Not enough to really encourage innovation and progress.</v>

3258
01:21:26.690 --> 01:21:26.841
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3259
01:21:26.841 --> 01:21:28.250
<v Speaker 3>I can agree with that for sure,</v>

3260
01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:30.050
<v Speaker 3>but I also think there's a,</v>

3261
01:21:30.650 --> 01:21:34.040
<v Speaker 3>there's a saying that I was told a lot that people don't get rich because they</v>

3262
01:21:34.041 --> 01:21:34.461
<v Speaker 3>want money,</v>

3263
01:21:34.461 --> 01:21:36.620
<v Speaker 3>they get rich because they're passionate about something and the money comes</v>

3264
01:21:36.621 --> 01:21:36.981
<v Speaker 3>after,</v>

3265
01:21:36.981 --> 01:21:37.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3266
01:21:37.161 --> 01:21:40.340
<v Speaker 3>they always say that the money comes after something like that and I point out</v>

3267
01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.210
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

3268
01:21:41.210 --> 01:21:42.950
<v Speaker 3>every day I take no days off.</v>

3269
01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.560
<v Speaker 3>It's been a couple years with me not taking any days off.</v>

3270
01:21:45.561 --> 01:21:47.210
<v Speaker 3>I work literally every day full time.</v>

3271
01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:49.700
<v Speaker 3>Right now I'm Producing six youtube videos every day.</v>

3272
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Only one of them is a real seven days a week,</v>

3273
01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:52.311
<v Speaker 3>seven days a week,</v>

3274
01:21:52.311 --> 01:21:53.390
<v Speaker 3>nonstop for two years straight.</v>

3275
01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:54.770
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you do on yourself.</v>

3276
01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:55.190
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

3277
01:21:55.190 --> 01:21:56.540
<v Speaker 3>It's fun and that's the thing.</v>

3278
01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:57.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

3279
01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:57.621
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing it.</v>

3280
01:21:57.621 --> 01:21:59.390
<v Speaker 3>you're enjoying this lady down the tunnel.</v>

3281
01:21:59.391 --> 01:22:00.890
<v Speaker 3>I do it because you know,</v>

3282
01:22:00.891 --> 01:22:01.970
<v Speaker 3>I see things on a.</v>

3283
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:04.490
<v Speaker 3>So for the most part on my main youtube channel,</v>

3284
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:06.680
<v Speaker 3>I do one video every day at 4:00 PM,</v>

3285
01:22:06.681 --> 01:22:09.170
<v Speaker 3>which tends to be just like a news analysis piece,</v>

3286
01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:10.370
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not perfect.</v>

3287
01:22:10.371 --> 01:22:12.410
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I get all hyperbolic and stuff.</v>

3288
01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:15.000
<v Speaker 3>My second channel is me just ranting and you know,</v>

3289
01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:18.140
<v Speaker 3>not really swearing but still just like heavy opinion stuff.</v>

3290
01:22:18.650 --> 01:22:19.483
<v Speaker 3>I do it because it's fun,</v>

3291
01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:20.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3292
01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:20.631
<v Speaker 3>I see something.</v>

3293
01:22:20.631 --> 01:22:21.464
<v Speaker 3>I want to explore it.</v>

3294
01:22:21.850 --> 01:22:22.120
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

3295
01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:24.110
<v Speaker 3>I used to travel all the time when I worked at vice,</v>

3296
01:22:24.111 --> 01:22:26.540
<v Speaker 3>I was in all these different countries and all these dangerous places,</v>

3297
01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:29.090
<v Speaker 3>not because I wanted to have a name for myself,</v>

3298
01:22:29.091 --> 01:22:30.140
<v Speaker 3>not because I wanted to make money,</v>

3299
01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:32.030
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to watch her evolution,</v>

3300
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:34.640
<v Speaker 3>I want to know why it was happening and I want to talk to the people who were</v>

3301
01:22:34.641 --> 01:22:36.260
<v Speaker 3>experiencing it so I can,</v>

3302
01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:36.650
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

3303
01:22:36.650 --> 01:22:40.160
<v Speaker 3>I can relate to people who say money isn't a motivator for sure,</v>

3304
01:22:40.670 --> 01:22:44.870
<v Speaker 3>but I've also talked to people in scandinavia who have told me they sort of give</v>

3305
01:22:44.871 --> 01:22:48.020
<v Speaker 3>up at a certain point because I can't remember which country it was.</v>

3306
01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:51.410
<v Speaker 3>It may have been Sweden or Norway,</v>

3307
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:55.280
<v Speaker 3>but these two women toLd me that after like $77,000 per year,</v>

3308
01:22:55.281 --> 01:22:56.540
<v Speaker 3>they tax lIke 80 percent of your income.</v>

3309
01:22:56.541 --> 01:22:57.374
<v Speaker 3>So people just stopped.</v>

3310
01:22:57.710 --> 01:22:58.590
<v Speaker 3>They literally just stopped that.</v>

3311
01:22:58.591 --> 01:22:58.690
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

3312
01:22:58.690 --> 01:22:59.740
<v Speaker 1>another proposition,</v>

3313
01:22:59.741 --> 01:23:00.010
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3314
01:23:00.010 --> 01:23:03.520
<v Speaker 1>This is something else that's been discussed in terms of anyone who makes more</v>

3315
01:23:03.521 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 1>than x amount per year taxing over 70</v>

3316
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:06.750
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

3317
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:09.670
<v Speaker 3>So I agree with the progressive tax wholeheartedly.</v>

3318
01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:11.230
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with that number of that high.</v>

3319
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:13.060
<v Speaker 3>What do you think it should be?</v>

3320
01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:14.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

3321
01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:14.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3322
01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:18.640
<v Speaker 3>but I will say we need more progressive brackets.</v>

3323
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:20.320
<v Speaker 3>We need to keep going and you know,</v>

3324
01:23:20.321 --> 01:23:22.510
<v Speaker 3>I got to say maybe maybe at $10,000,000,</v>

3325
01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:23.860
<v Speaker 3>70 percent does make sense,</v>

3326
01:23:23.861 --> 01:23:27.220
<v Speaker 3>but I kind of leaned towards not really because it seems like man,</v>

3327
01:23:27.221 --> 01:23:27.851
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot of money.</v>

3328
01:23:27.851 --> 01:23:28.331
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot.</v>

3329
01:23:28.331 --> 01:23:28.510
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3330
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:28.770
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3331
01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:29.290
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3332
01:23:29.290 --> 01:23:29.560
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3333
01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:30.460
<v Speaker 3>that's ridiculous amount.</v>

3334
01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:30.960
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3335
01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:34.900
<v Speaker 3>I think steve bannon said something like a five in front of it or something,</v>

3336
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:35.891
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

3337
01:23:35.891 --> 01:23:36.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm not an economist,</v>

3338
01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.370
<v Speaker 3>but I do believe a progressive tax makes the most sense.</v>

3339
01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.350
<v Speaker 3>And I can explain it to you if you want to hear it.</v>

3340
01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:42.213
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3341
01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:43.140
<v Speaker 3>So there was a study,</v>

3342
01:23:43.141 --> 01:23:43.360
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3343
01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:43.600
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3344
01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.770
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was from harvard,</v>

3345
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:47.260
<v Speaker 3>you need $77,000 per year.</v>

3346
01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:51.280
<v Speaker 3>It may have been 10 years ago in order to be middleclass median in the United</v>

3347
01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:51.880
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

3348
01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:55.300
<v Speaker 3>That means if you make 77,000 and you'll have a vacation,</v>

3349
01:23:55.301 --> 01:23:56.051
<v Speaker 3>you'll have insurance,</v>

3350
01:23:56.051 --> 01:23:56.531
<v Speaker 3>you'll have a car,</v>

3351
01:23:56.531 --> 01:23:57.281
<v Speaker 3>you can raise a family,</v>

3352
01:23:57.281 --> 01:23:58.061
<v Speaker 3>you can send them to school,</v>

3353
01:23:58.061 --> 01:23:58.750
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff,</v>

3354
01:23:58.750 --> 01:24:00.720
<v Speaker 3>but you have nothing left over for savings.</v>

3355
01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:02.020
<v Speaker 3>You have nothing left over for investments.</v>

3356
01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.880
<v Speaker 3>If you make $100,000 a year,</v>

3357
01:24:03.881 --> 01:24:06.280
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna have $23,000 leftover for investing.</v>

3358
01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.020
<v Speaker 3>Eventually at a certain point,</v>

3359
01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:10.630
<v Speaker 3>if you only need $77,000,</v>

3360
01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:11.830
<v Speaker 3>if you're making 10 million,</v>

3361
01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:13.540
<v Speaker 3>you've got 9 million,</v>

3362
01:24:13.541 --> 01:24:17.890
<v Speaker 3>900 and 900,000 that you can invest and just be independently wealthy and be</v>

3363
01:24:17.891 --> 01:24:18.724
<v Speaker 3>rich forever.</v>

3364
01:24:19.150 --> 01:24:19.361
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

3365
01:24:19.361 --> 01:24:20.470
<v Speaker 3>I have no problem with being wealthy.</v>

3366
01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:21.040
<v Speaker 3>I have no.</v>

3367
01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.590
<v Speaker 3>I have no problem with other people being wealthy and living off of their</v>

3368
01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:24.424
<v Speaker 3>investments and all that,</v>

3369
01:24:24.730 --> 01:24:26.430
<v Speaker 3>but there is a point where you have to realize the,</v>

3370
01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:26.830
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3371
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:27.120
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3372
01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.630
<v Speaker 3>the coalescing of power,</v>

3373
01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:32.260
<v Speaker 3>the monopolizing of power is a really dangerous thing for any society to few</v>

3374
01:24:32.261 --> 01:24:35.010
<v Speaker 3>individuals holding too much power can destabilize an economy,</v>

3375
01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:36.130
<v Speaker 3>can destabilize the country.</v>

3376
01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:37.750
<v Speaker 3>The problem with communism,</v>

3377
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:41.350
<v Speaker 3>you snap your fingers and you put a centralized authority in place.</v>

3378
01:24:41.530 --> 01:24:42.940
<v Speaker 3>At least that's how it's been every single time,</v>

3379
01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.280
<v Speaker 3>and then they hold all the cards and they can oppress over.</v>

3380
01:24:45.281 --> 01:24:47.290
<v Speaker 3>They want the problem with laissez faire.</v>

3381
01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:48.790
<v Speaker 3>Capitalism has over time,</v>

3382
01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:51.070
<v Speaker 3>which is why it's better in a lot of ways.</v>

3383
01:24:51.071 --> 01:24:51.581
<v Speaker 3>Over time.</v>

3384
01:24:51.581 --> 01:24:55.420
<v Speaker 3>It eventually becomes a centralized oligopoly of a few corporations controlling</v>

3385
01:24:55.421 --> 01:24:55.781
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

3386
01:24:55.781 --> 01:24:56.680
<v Speaker 3>which we're kind of seeing now.</v>

3387
01:24:57.250 --> 01:25:01.030
<v Speaker 3>So all the progressive tax can really do is slow that process down,</v>

3388
01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.170
<v Speaker 3>which I think is a good thing.</v>

3389
01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:05.710
<v Speaker 3>But ultimately I think just looking at the system,</v>

3390
01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:07.600
<v Speaker 3>eventually you end up kind of where we are,</v>

3391
01:25:07.601 --> 01:25:10.910
<v Speaker 3>where six media companies control everything and then you know,</v>

3392
01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:14.650
<v Speaker 3>some companies are the biggest funders of certain politicians and corporations.</v>

3393
01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:15.760
<v Speaker 3>It's have too much power.</v>

3394
01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:16.481
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3395
01:25:16.481 --> 01:25:16.561
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3396
01:25:16.561 --> 01:25:17.090
<v Speaker 3>there is,</v>

3397
01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:17.923
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3398
01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:18.490
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3399
01:25:18.490 --> 01:25:23.490
<v Speaker 3>I remember reading a report or a story about how wealthy people have like three</v>

3400
01:25:24.341 --> 01:25:28.150
<v Speaker 3>or four times more ability to influence a politician than like the majority of</v>

3401
01:25:28.151 --> 01:25:31.000
<v Speaker 3>the people in the country simply because paying for expensive dinners and</v>

3402
01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:32.620
<v Speaker 3>lobbying earns you favors,</v>

3403
01:25:33.130 --> 01:25:33.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3404
01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:34.910
<v Speaker 3>super pacs paying,</v>

3405
01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:35.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3406
01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:36.650
<v Speaker 3>guaranteeing funding for,</v>

3407
01:25:36.670 --> 01:25:38.260
<v Speaker 3>for a politician or as your favorites.</v>

3408
01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:39.483
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

3409
01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:40.121
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3410
01:25:40.121 --> 01:25:40.410
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3411
01:25:40.410 --> 01:25:42.760
<v Speaker 3>if a million people telling me they want x,</v>

3412
01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:46.720
<v Speaker 3>but the people who are paying me like pa funding my campaign are paying me more,</v>

3413
01:25:47.170 --> 01:25:47.351
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3414
01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:48.580
<v Speaker 3>who am I going to provide favors too?</v>

3415
01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:50.320
<v Speaker 3>And then once I'm done with my campaign run,</v>

3416
01:25:50.321 --> 01:25:51.460
<v Speaker 3>I can go to job at their company.</v>

3417
01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:53.140
<v Speaker 3>Yet these are problems.</v>

3418
01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.520
<v Speaker 3>So without going on too big of a rant,</v>

3419
01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:59.530
<v Speaker 3>I think ultimately a progressive tax can help slow the process down of special</v>

3420
01:25:59.531 --> 01:26:00.040
<v Speaker 3>interests,</v>

3421
01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.300
<v Speaker 3>acquiring too much power.</v>

3422
01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:02.440
<v Speaker 3>Eventually it happens anyway.</v>

3423
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:03.800
<v Speaker 3>But with a flat tax,</v>

3424
01:26:03.801 --> 01:26:07.700
<v Speaker 3>you're basically saying at a certain point you can just keep dumping more and</v>

3425
01:26:07.701 --> 01:26:08.780
<v Speaker 3>more money into different investments.</v>

3426
01:26:08.781 --> 01:26:12.080
<v Speaker 3>Making more and more money and increasing your power exponentially and other</v>

3427
01:26:12.081 --> 01:26:14.810
<v Speaker 3>people can't catch up to you and then power becomes too quick,</v>

3428
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:15.743
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3429
01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:17.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3430
01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:23.060
<v Speaker 1>I think in this country we try to look at success and achievement is something</v>

3431
01:26:23.611 --> 01:26:26.700
<v Speaker 1>that everyone's striving for it and we don't want to put any restrictions on</v>

3432
01:26:26.701 --> 01:26:27.210
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3433
01:26:27.210 --> 01:26:30.450
<v Speaker 1>We look At capitalism is the reason why everything's going so great over here.</v>

3434
01:26:30.451 --> 01:26:31.141
<v Speaker 1>This is America.</v>

3435
01:26:31.141 --> 01:26:31.471
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta,</v>

3436
01:26:31.471 --> 01:26:32.490
<v Speaker 1>the free home of the brave.</v>

3437
01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Go out there and kick ass.</v>

3438
01:26:33.871 --> 01:26:35.310
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to saddle you now with debt,</v>

3439
01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:40.980
<v Speaker 1>but it makes sense that after a while as we're seeing today,</v>

3440
01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:42.750
<v Speaker 1>but I don't mean what is,</v>

3441
01:26:42.810 --> 01:26:45.570
<v Speaker 1>what's the best way to do it in socialism is not gonna work.</v>

3442
01:26:45.571 --> 01:26:45.941
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

3443
01:26:45.941 --> 01:26:46.150
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3444
01:26:46.150 --> 01:26:46.983
<v Speaker 1>what does work?</v>

3445
01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:48.610
<v Speaker 3>I think a mixed economy,</v>

3446
01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:50.440
<v Speaker 3>mixed economy where we are right now,</v>

3447
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3448
01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:53.810
<v Speaker 3>A portion of income is paid in taxes for government programs for the,</v>

3449
01:26:53.890 --> 01:26:54.723
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>

3450
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:55.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3451
01:26:55.150 --> 01:26:56.380
<v Speaker 3>for defense and things like that.</v>

3452
01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:58.540
<v Speaker 3>I just think we have a big problem with corruption.</v>

3453
01:26:58.840 --> 01:26:59.950
<v Speaker 3>I think we've got bloat.</v>

3454
01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:04.600
<v Speaker 3>I think we've got government agencies that instead of reforming and breaking</v>

3455
01:27:04.601 --> 01:27:05.230
<v Speaker 3>them down,</v>

3456
01:27:05.230 --> 01:27:07.180
<v Speaker 3>we just slept more bandaids on top.</v>

3457
01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:07.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3458
01:27:07.630 --> 01:27:10.000
<v Speaker 3>we've got a festering wound and we're putting bandages over bandages.</v>

3459
01:27:10.090 --> 01:27:10.271
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3460
01:27:10.271 --> 01:27:11.051
<v Speaker 3>it's like a certain point.</v>

3461
01:27:11.051 --> 01:27:11.890
<v Speaker 3>You gotta redo it.</v>

3462
01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:13.180
<v Speaker 3>We also have system</v>

3463
01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:14.840
<v Speaker 1>that are in place that.</v>

3464
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:20.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean in terms of like the way communities have always existed in certain</v>

3465
01:27:22.281 --> 01:27:22.911
<v Speaker 1>communities.</v>

3466
01:27:22.911 --> 01:27:26.480
<v Speaker 1>There's just poverty and crime and no one does anything to fix it.</v>

3467
01:27:26.610 --> 01:27:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3468
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:28.510
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to be that will.</v>

3469
01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:32.600
<v Speaker 1>We're more than willing to go to other countries and nation built were more than</v>

3470
01:27:32.601 --> 01:27:35.000
<v Speaker 1>willing to pump money into different countries,</v>

3471
01:27:35.001 --> 01:27:36.440
<v Speaker 1>especially if they have natural resources,</v>

3472
01:27:36.441 --> 01:27:37.940
<v Speaker 1>but in our own country,</v>

3473
01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:41.330
<v Speaker 1>we're not mean the the greatest resources of course human beings and the best</v>

3474
01:27:41.331 --> 01:27:45.200
<v Speaker 1>way to make America great or stronger would be to have less losers or what's the</v>

3475
01:27:45.201 --> 01:27:46.640
<v Speaker 1>best way to have less losers,</v>

3476
01:27:46.641 --> 01:27:47.780
<v Speaker 1>to have more people succeed.</v>

3477
01:27:47.781 --> 01:27:49.310
<v Speaker 1>What's the best way to have more people succeed?</v>

3478
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Give them more opportunity and chance to not be stuck in a quagmire,</v>

3479
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:54.620
<v Speaker 1>not be trapped in a ghetto.</v>

3480
01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:55.330
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

3481
01:27:55.330 --> 01:27:55.601
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3482
01:27:55.601 --> 01:28:00.601
<v Speaker 3>so I believe we should allocate access from other areas to improve the</v>

3483
01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:01.840
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

3484
01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:02.411
<v Speaker 1>In that sense,</v>

3485
01:28:02.411 --> 01:28:05.650
<v Speaker 1>I believe in socialism to a certain extent like it with,</v>

3486
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:07.030
<v Speaker 1>with fire departments.</v>

3487
01:28:07.031 --> 01:28:08.350
<v Speaker 1>I Believe in it with the police department.</v>

3488
01:28:08.351 --> 01:28:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I believe we should spend money that comes out of,</v>

3489
01:28:10.770 --> 01:28:11.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3490
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
<v Speaker 1>the publIc pool to fix things.</v>

3491
01:28:13.001 --> 01:28:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3492
01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.420
<v Speaker 3>I look at New York,</v>

3493
01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.830
<v Speaker 3>there are some neighborhoods that are really bad.</v>

3494
01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:17.000
<v Speaker 3>Some neighborhoods that are really good.</v>

3495
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:21.980
<v Speaker 3>well if we take excess from the really great neighborhoods and use that to fix</v>

3496
01:28:21.981 --> 01:28:22.281
<v Speaker 3>roads,</v>

3497
01:28:22.281 --> 01:28:23.690
<v Speaker 3>pay for schools in poor neighborhoods,</v>

3498
01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:27.200
<v Speaker 3>crime is one of the biggest correlations for crime and poverty.</v>

3499
01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:27.620
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3500
01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:29.570
<v Speaker 3>So if we can get better schools,</v>

3501
01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:31.910
<v Speaker 3>we need to reform the school system straight up.</v>

3502
01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:33.620
<v Speaker 3>If we can get better hospItals,</v>

3503
01:28:33.621 --> 01:28:34.670
<v Speaker 3>if we can fix the roads,</v>

3504
01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:38.870
<v Speaker 3>then we're doing a lot to reduce crime and reduce poverty and a rising tide</v>

3505
01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:39.733
<v Speaker 3>lifts all ships.</v>

3506
01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:43.250
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I.</v>

3507
01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:44.180
<v Speaker 3>That's why I like bernie sanders,</v>

3508
01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:45.170
<v Speaker 3>although I will,</v>

3509
01:28:45.171 --> 01:28:47.660
<v Speaker 3>I say I make sure I tell people like he is a little too left for me.</v>

3510
01:28:47.661 --> 01:28:48.494
<v Speaker 3>He is,</v>

3511
01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:49.000
<v Speaker 3>but when we,</v>

3512
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.170
<v Speaker 3>when we were looking at who we had in 2016,</v>

3513
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.921
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3514
01:28:51.921 --> 01:28:52.131
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3515
01:28:52.131 --> 01:28:52.940
<v Speaker 3>bernie's my guy,</v>

3516
01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:53.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3517
01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:54.470
<v Speaker 3>I like some parts of them.</v>

3518
01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:55.640
<v Speaker 3>I liked him culturally.</v>

3519
01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:56.410
<v Speaker 3>I liked to,</v>

3520
01:28:56.410 --> 01:28:57.243
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3521
01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:58.213
<v Speaker 3>for the same</v>

3522
01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.330
<v Speaker 1>in some ways that I liked obama culturally.</v>

3523
01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:00.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3524
01:29:00.661 --> 01:29:02.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't the drone attacks,</v>

3525
01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:04.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the attacks on whistleblowers.</v>

3526
01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:07.980
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of aspects of it that I've found very disturbing and distasteful</v>

3527
01:29:07.981 --> 01:29:10.860
<v Speaker 1>and against the narrative of what we think of who he is.</v>

3528
01:29:10.861 --> 01:29:13.380
<v Speaker 1>We think of him as this extremely articulate,</v>

3529
01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:16.430
<v Speaker 1>very well read educated guy and you know,</v>

3530
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:17.250
<v Speaker 1>a good,</v>

3531
01:29:17.250 --> 01:29:19.830
<v Speaker 1>a good figurehead in terms of like who the president is,</v>

3532
01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:20.301
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3533
01:29:20.301 --> 01:29:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3534
01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:21.040
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3535
01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:24.400
<v Speaker 3>and he was drowned bombing foreign countries.</v>

3536
01:29:24.410 --> 01:29:27.950
<v Speaker 3>His administration was claiming that military aged men who were enemy</v>

3537
01:29:27.951 --> 01:29:28.784
<v Speaker 3>combatants,</v>

3538
01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:29.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3539
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:31.280
<v Speaker 3>so one of the,</v>

3540
01:29:31.281 --> 01:29:33.050
<v Speaker 3>one of the biggest age men period,</v>

3541
01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:33.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3542
01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:34.080
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3543
01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:36.760
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a dude carrying water pills gets blown up and they're like,</v>

3544
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:38.150
<v Speaker 3>as a combatant realization.</v>

3545
01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:39.050
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

3546
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:39.291
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3547
01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:40.220
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to trump,</v>

3548
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:41.930
<v Speaker 3>what did he do in missile strike in Syria?</v>

3549
01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Weapons deal with Saudi Arabia.</v>

3550
01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:44.570
<v Speaker 3>Commando raids in Yemen,</v>

3551
01:29:44.571 --> 01:29:47.300
<v Speaker 3>a little girl got killed and I've been for the most part,</v>

3552
01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:47.781
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

3553
01:29:47.781 --> 01:29:51.260
<v Speaker 3>very critical of him in any other administration who engages in regime change</v>

3554
01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:52.094
<v Speaker 3>foreign wars.</v>

3555
01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:52.971
<v Speaker 3>And look,</v>

3556
01:29:52.971 --> 01:29:53.804
<v Speaker 3>I got to say,</v>

3557
01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:54.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3558
01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:55.520
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to domestic issues,</v>

3559
01:29:55.521 --> 01:29:56.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

3560
01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:59.390
<v Speaker 3>that's not my wheelhouse when it comes to foreign policy stuff.</v>

3561
01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:01.430
<v Speaker 3>Only a little bit like I've been to some countries,</v>

3562
01:30:01.431 --> 01:30:02.211
<v Speaker 3>I've experienced stuff,</v>

3563
01:30:02.211 --> 01:30:02.691
<v Speaker 3>but really,</v>

3564
01:30:02.691 --> 01:30:03.524
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3565
01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:06.710
<v Speaker 3>on the ground cultural between people is more my thing.</v>

3566
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:09.050
<v Speaker 3>But I know more about foreign policy than domestic.</v>

3567
01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:11.060
<v Speaker 3>And when I see trump's foreign policy,</v>

3568
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:12.770
<v Speaker 3>I was very critical of it.</v>

3569
01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:15.080
<v Speaker 3>But I will point out withdrawing from Syria,</v>

3570
01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:16.243
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fan.</v>

3571
01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:16.821
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3572
01:30:16.821 --> 01:30:19.580
<v Speaker 3>I understand a lot more than probably the average person does.</v>

3573
01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:21.230
<v Speaker 3>Some of the issues surrounding Syria,</v>

3574
01:30:21.231 --> 01:30:21.741
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

3575
01:30:21.741 --> 01:30:22.081
<v Speaker 3>the Qatar,</v>

3576
01:30:22.081 --> 01:30:23.150
<v Speaker 3>Turkey pipeline and things.</v>

3577
01:30:23.151 --> 01:30:26.880
<v Speaker 3>But typically I think it's usually a bad idea when the u s involves itself's in</v>

3578
01:30:26.881 --> 01:30:29.990
<v Speaker 3>foreign foreign interests and tries engaging in these regimes,</v>

3579
01:30:30.250 --> 01:30:32.450
<v Speaker 3>change strategies to build allies.</v>

3580
01:30:32.930 --> 01:30:36.950
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things that really blew my mind is I saw a survey,</v>

3581
01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:39.290
<v Speaker 3>at least it was going on in the inner on social media.</v>

3582
01:30:39.291 --> 01:30:42.380
<v Speaker 3>So who knows if it's true that claimed the democrats have a favorable opinion of</v>

3583
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:43.370
<v Speaker 3>george w dot bush,</v>

3584
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:44.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3585
01:30:44.031 --> 01:30:45.230
<v Speaker 3>some something to that effect.</v>

3586
01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.930
<v Speaker 3>And they're there in retrospect like,</v>

3587
01:30:47.931 --> 01:30:48.081
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3588
01:30:48.081 --> 01:30:49.430
<v Speaker 3>like today they pulled them,</v>

3589
01:30:49.431 --> 01:30:49.671
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

3590
01:30:49.671 --> 01:30:49.761
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3591
01:30:49.761 --> 01:30:50.150
<v Speaker 3>he was good.</v>

3592
01:30:50.150 --> 01:30:52.580
<v Speaker 3>And there's a video of him like giving a piece of candy to Michelle Obama.</v>

3593
01:30:52.581 --> 01:30:53.121
<v Speaker 3>And everyone was like,</v>

3594
01:30:53.121 --> 01:30:53.721
<v Speaker 3>what's going viral?</v>

3595
01:30:53.721 --> 01:30:54.554
<v Speaker 3>And people are laughing about.</v>

3596
01:30:54.570 --> 01:30:54.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3597
01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:55.491
<v Speaker 3>are you not?</v>

3598
01:30:55.491 --> 01:30:56.450
<v Speaker 3>Say hold hands.</v>

3599
01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:57.403
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3600
01:30:57.530 --> 01:30:59.330
<v Speaker 3>That guy is awful like that guy.</v>

3601
01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:00.860
<v Speaker 3>But what happened?</v>

3602
01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:03.980
<v Speaker 3>And then when trump announces he's going to pull troops out of Syria,</v>

3603
01:31:03.981 --> 01:31:04.880
<v Speaker 3>everybody opposes it,</v>

3604
01:31:04.881 --> 01:31:07.580
<v Speaker 3>like the media saying it's wrong and you've got a lot of like mainstream people</v>

3605
01:31:07.581 --> 01:31:08.301
<v Speaker 3>on the left saying it's wrong.</v>

3606
01:31:08.301 --> 01:31:09.134
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3607
01:31:09.470 --> 01:31:10.303
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

3608
01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:11.473
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>

3609
01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:12.860
<v Speaker 3>Like that's crazy to me.</v>

3610
01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:13.400
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3611
01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:13.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3612
01:31:13.851 --> 01:31:14.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3613
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:15.320
<v Speaker 3>all of my activist friends,</v>

3614
01:31:15.321 --> 01:31:16.670
<v Speaker 3>we've never been in favor of that stuff.</v>

3615
01:31:16.671 --> 01:31:17.320
<v Speaker 3>We've always opposed.</v>

3616
01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:18.710
<v Speaker 3>That's always been the left's position.</v>

3617
01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:22.880
<v Speaker 3>And now I'm seeing people who claim to be on the left support multinational</v>

3618
01:31:22.881 --> 01:31:25.040
<v Speaker 3>businesses as private businesses doing whatever they want,</v>

3619
01:31:25.490 --> 01:31:26.001
<v Speaker 3>meaning look,</v>

3620
01:31:26.001 --> 01:31:26.571
<v Speaker 3>social media,</v>

3621
01:31:26.571 --> 01:31:26.890
<v Speaker 3>corporate,</v>

3622
01:31:26.890 --> 01:31:27.680
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3623
01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:28.310
<v Speaker 3>like dude,</v>

3624
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3625
01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:29.421
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia,</v>

3626
01:31:29.421 --> 01:31:31.880
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a saudi prince is one of the biggest investors in twitter.</v>

3627
01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:33.050
<v Speaker 3>Real.</v>

3628
01:31:33.050 --> 01:31:33.411
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3629
01:31:33.411 --> 01:31:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3630
01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:37.880
<v Speaker 3>And so it's like there have been a series of people who have gotten letters that</v>

3631
01:31:37.881 --> 01:31:39.290
<v Speaker 3>they violated pakistani law.</v>

3632
01:31:39.650 --> 01:31:40.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3633
01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:40.340
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3634
01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:41.210
<v Speaker 3>they send screenshots,</v>

3635
01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.230
<v Speaker 3>screenshots can be faked.</v>

3636
01:31:42.231 --> 01:31:44.390
<v Speaker 3>But there've been a couple of people who have been like,</v>

3637
01:31:44.391 --> 01:31:46.730
<v Speaker 3>for some reason twitter decided to inform me of this.</v>

3638
01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:48.740
<v Speaker 3>And then it's,</v>

3639
01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:49.240
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3640
01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:50.210
<v Speaker 3>it's a multinational.</v>

3641
01:31:50.230 --> 01:31:50.571
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>

3642
01:31:50.571 --> 01:31:52.970
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about the algorithmic apocalypse.</v>

3643
01:31:53.010 --> 01:31:53.990
<v Speaker 3>Let's segue into that.</v>

3644
01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:58.580
<v Speaker 3>You've got a platform where our public discourse is happening where the left has</v>

3645
01:31:58.581 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 3>repeatedly said that russians</v>

3646
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:04.390
<v Speaker 2>used it to manipulate our elections were one of its biggest investors is a saudi</v>

3647
01:32:04.391 --> 01:32:05.950
<v Speaker 2>prince or something to that effect.</v>

3648
01:32:06.370 --> 01:32:07.750
<v Speaker 2>And they're banning.</v>

3649
01:32:07.751 --> 01:32:08.580
<v Speaker 2>People have,</v>

3650
01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:09.580
<v Speaker 2>have a certain,</v>

3651
01:32:09.630 --> 01:32:09.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3652
01:32:09.850 --> 01:32:11.350
<v Speaker 2>who oppose a certain ideological bent.</v>

3653
01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3654
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:13.600
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like a democratic crisis,</v>

3655
01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:14.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3656
01:32:14.490 --> 01:32:14.820
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

3657
01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:16.480
<v Speaker 2>if this is where the public sphere is,</v>

3658
01:32:16.481 --> 01:32:18.790
<v Speaker 2>if you know you said milo's no longer in the conversation,</v>

3659
01:32:19.230 --> 01:32:19.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3660
01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:21.340
<v Speaker 2>he's banned from twitter even though got millions of followers,</v>

3661
01:32:21.710 --> 01:32:22.600
<v Speaker 2>they don't talk about him anymore.</v>

3662
01:32:22.601 --> 01:32:23.350
<v Speaker 2>He's off twitter.</v>

3663
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Twitter really is important.</v>

3664
01:32:24.211 --> 01:32:25.044
<v Speaker 2>The president is there.</v>

3665
01:32:25.330 --> 01:32:26.860
<v Speaker 2>So if you start removing people,</v>

3666
01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:29.740
<v Speaker 2>you've got foreign interests who have a stake in what twitter is doing.</v>

3667
01:32:30.010 --> 01:32:30.281
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3668
01:32:30.281 --> 01:32:32.800
<v Speaker 2>they can seriously influence our elections and,</v>

3669
01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:33.010
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3670
01:32:33.010 --> 01:32:34.600
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

3671
01:32:34.630 --> 01:32:35.370
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

3672
01:32:35.370 --> 01:32:35.670
<v Speaker 2>But I'll,</v>

3673
01:32:35.670 --> 01:32:35.980
<v Speaker 2>but I'll,</v>

3674
01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:40.360
<v Speaker 2>but I'll move into a what most really crazy New York times reported.</v>

3675
01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:45.420
<v Speaker 2>There's a group that false flagged the republicans in Alabama with fake twitter</v>

3676
01:32:45.671 --> 01:32:48.460
<v Speaker 2>accounts they made to convince the media.</v>

3677
01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Russians were propping up the campaign of Roy Moore.</v>

3678
01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:57.060
<v Speaker 2>So basically this coordinator times is all fact this.</v>

3679
01:32:57.190 --> 01:32:58.090
<v Speaker 2>They've seen the documents,</v>

3680
01:32:58.091 --> 01:32:58.924
<v Speaker 2>they've reported it,</v>

3681
01:32:59.050 --> 01:33:02.080
<v Speaker 2>that democratic operatives smeared,</v>

3682
01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:02.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3683
01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:05.320
<v Speaker 2>engaging a false flag campaign to make it appear like the russians were popping</v>

3684
01:33:05.321 --> 01:33:05.411
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

3685
01:33:05.411 --> 01:33:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Republicans and the national media in the us ran with it.</v>

3686
01:33:08.170 --> 01:33:12.580
<v Speaker 2>How that's not a crime is beyond me that's interfering in elections and we know</v>

3687
01:33:12.581 --> 01:33:13.414
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3688
01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:15.040
<v Speaker 2>And this group is still being cited.</v>

3689
01:33:15.041 --> 01:33:16.180
<v Speaker 2>They're smearing tulsi gabbard,</v>

3690
01:33:16.181 --> 01:33:16.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3691
01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3692
01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:19.420
<v Speaker 2>An nbc news article came out saying that russians are,</v>

3693
01:33:19.450 --> 01:33:19.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3694
01:33:19.651 --> 01:33:20.620
<v Speaker 2>have taken notice of her campaign,</v>

3695
01:33:20.621 --> 01:33:21.160
<v Speaker 2>are promoting it.</v>

3696
01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:21.993
<v Speaker 2>Same group,</v>

3697
01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:24.060
<v Speaker 2>still running the story.</v>

3698
01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:29.020
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

3699
01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:32.070
<v Speaker 2>how that's not a crime is mind blowing to me.</v>

3700
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:33.870
<v Speaker 2>But the New York times reported it.</v>

3701
01:33:33.871 --> 01:33:35.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's at this point it's like,</v>

3702
01:33:35.730 --> 01:33:35.971
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3703
01:33:35.971 --> 01:33:36.130
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3704
01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:39.420
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to be aware that there's so much manipulation going on right now</v>

3705
01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.250
<v Speaker 2>from almost every angle.</v>

3706
01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:41.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3707
01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:42.630
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

3708
01:33:42.630 --> 01:33:47.190
<v Speaker 2>and what's hilarious is that people look at what's going on with russian troll</v>

3709
01:33:47.191 --> 01:33:49.020
<v Speaker 2>factories and you know,</v>

3710
01:33:49.021 --> 01:33:50.700
<v Speaker 2>the way they're trying to influence our elections,</v>

3711
01:33:50.701 --> 01:33:54.840
<v Speaker 2>that it's particularly egregious where we do that shit.</v>

3712
01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:56.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll totally plus.</v>

3713
01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:59.280
<v Speaker 2>And I'm pretty sure we learned about the us doing it well before we learned</v>

3714
01:33:59.281 --> 01:34:01.900
<v Speaker 2>Russia was doing it and I'd be willing to bet the us started it.</v>

3715
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:03.270
<v Speaker 2>It's just the whole thing is.</v>

3716
01:34:03.271 --> 01:34:06.600
<v Speaker 2>So you can't pay attention to all of it.</v>

3717
01:34:06.690 --> 01:34:07.740
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the problem.</v>

3718
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3719
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:08.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3720
01:34:08.071 --> 01:34:08.970
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can,</v>

3721
01:34:09.230 --> 01:34:11.340
<v Speaker 2>if this is what you're doing seven days a week and,</v>

3722
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:12.421
<v Speaker 2>and even,</v>

3723
01:34:12.421 --> 01:34:14.340
<v Speaker 2>you will probably struggle to keep up,</v>

3724
01:34:14.670 --> 01:34:15.510
<v Speaker 2>but like me,</v>

3725
01:34:15.511 --> 01:34:18.960
<v Speaker 2>I can't and it's one of the reasons why I brought you in here when you and I had</v>

3726
01:34:18.961 --> 01:34:19.860
<v Speaker 2>that conversation.</v>

3727
01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:22.590
<v Speaker 2>One of the first things I realized right away was,</v>

3728
01:34:22.591 --> 01:34:22.691
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3729
01:34:22.691 --> 01:34:23.524
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3730
01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:25.980
<v Speaker 2>I could have you coach me like we talked about this,</v>

3731
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:27.930
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to.</v>

3732
01:34:28.170 --> 01:34:28.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3733
01:34:28.590 --> 01:34:29.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get it all.</v>

3734
01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:33.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to like study it for a long time and I don't have the</v>

3735
01:34:33.331 --> 01:34:37.410
<v Speaker 2>resources to do that as part of the problem that I had with that one podcast</v>

3736
01:34:37.411 --> 01:34:37.771
<v Speaker 2>with jack.</v>

3737
01:34:37.771 --> 01:34:40.680
<v Speaker 2>I just don't have the resources and yes.</v>

3738
01:34:40.830 --> 01:34:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3739
01:34:41.190 --> 01:34:42.780
<v Speaker 2>so I think it'd be fair to point out,</v>

3740
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:43.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3741
01:34:43.081 --> 01:34:46.230
<v Speaker 2>like youtube criticism too because talking about censorship,</v>

3742
01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:49.680
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people immediately assumed I'd come out here and start waving</v>

3743
01:34:49.681 --> 01:34:50.610
<v Speaker 2>my arms in the air screaming.</v>

3744
01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:51.720
<v Speaker 2>They're biaSed against conservatives,</v>

3745
01:34:51.721 --> 01:34:52.830
<v Speaker 2>which I think twenty cent I kind of did.</v>

3746
01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:55.070
<v Speaker 2>but youtube is,</v>

3747
01:34:55.170 --> 01:34:56.730
<v Speaker 2>as is a bit different.</v>

3748
01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Youtube does,</v>

3749
01:34:58.310 --> 01:35:02.690
<v Speaker 3>it has demonetized lgbt content and youtube has said that these topics are not</v>

3750
01:35:02.691 --> 01:35:04.820
<v Speaker 3>suitable for all advertisers because it deals with sexuality.</v>

3751
01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:07.280
<v Speaker 3>They have target many left wing channels,</v>

3752
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:10.910
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of non mainstream left wing outlets.</v>

3753
01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:11.840
<v Speaker 3>And when you say target,</v>

3754
01:35:11.841 --> 01:35:15.380
<v Speaker 3>what you mean is demonetize do you monetize or sometimes outright ban?</v>

3755
01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:19.330
<v Speaker 3>And I think for demonetizing I think they've made a stick.</v>

3756
01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:20.121
<v Speaker 3>What was the,</v>

3757
01:35:20.121 --> 01:35:20.381
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3758
01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:23.150
<v Speaker 3>the policy that it's essentially things that are political.</v>

3759
01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.073
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

3760
01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:25.520
<v Speaker 4>If they made that statement,</v>

3761
01:35:25.521 --> 01:35:26.490
<v Speaker 4>I know that I've seen I was,</v>

3762
01:35:26.491 --> 01:35:26.840
<v Speaker 4>wasn't,</v>

3763
01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:29.870
<v Speaker 4>I was going to interject that they've also banned are not banned,</v>

3764
01:35:29.871 --> 01:35:30.591
<v Speaker 4>but do you monetize?</v>

3765
01:35:30.591 --> 01:35:33.870
<v Speaker 4>PeopLe are extensively people that smoke weed on their channel,</v>

3766
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:34.843
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>

3767
01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:39.130
<v Speaker 4>Certain video game channels that have for an unknown reasons just stopped having</v>

3768
01:35:39.131 --> 01:35:40.460
<v Speaker 4>a monetization on their channel too.</v>

3769
01:35:40.461 --> 01:35:40.700
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3770
01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:41.690
<v Speaker 3>And that is the problem.</v>

3771
01:35:41.710 --> 01:35:45.160
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately them having this incredible power where they,</v>

3772
01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:46.160
<v Speaker 3>they really,</v>

3773
01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:46.761
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

3774
01:35:46.761 --> 01:35:50.420
<v Speaker 3>there's not real open competition in terms of like another,</v>

3775
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:55.880
<v Speaker 3>like a parallel competitor and I don't think there will be mailing but.</v>

3776
01:35:55.881 --> 01:35:56.714
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing,</v>

3777
01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:57.643
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3778
01:35:58.140 --> 01:35:59.810
<v Speaker 3>I think you've touched on a bunch of really bad things.</v>

3779
01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:00.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to give a,</v>

3780
01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:03.020
<v Speaker 3>a very important shout out to monkey jones,</v>

3781
01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:07.220
<v Speaker 3>who was wrongly terminated from youtube for highly dubious reasons.</v>

3782
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:08.510
<v Speaker 3>He Is a dark,</v>

3783
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:09.201
<v Speaker 3>dark,</v>

3784
01:36:09.201 --> 01:36:09.530
<v Speaker 3>comedic,</v>

3785
01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:10.130
<v Speaker 3>dark comic.</v>

3786
01:36:10.130 --> 01:36:11.930
<v Speaker 3>He had hundreds of thousands of followers.</v>

3787
01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:15.410
<v Speaker 3>He made jokes about things like school shootings,</v>

3788
01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:16.333
<v Speaker 3>very dark stuff,</v>

3789
01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:17.990
<v Speaker 3>but it was clearly mocking.</v>

3790
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:19.760
<v Speaker 3>Some of these people was mocking elliot roger.</v>

3791
01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:23.840
<v Speaker 3>He was making jokes about it and in fact some of his videos were approved</v>

3792
01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:25.190
<v Speaker 3>manually for monetization,</v>

3793
01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:28.670
<v Speaker 3>but for some reason youtube just wiped them out one day gone.</v>

3794
01:36:29.210 --> 01:36:30.830
<v Speaker 3>So I set up a new channel and said,</v>

3795
01:36:30.831 --> 01:36:31.191
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3796
01:36:31.191 --> 01:36:31.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3797
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:32.360
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to do that anyway.</v>

3798
01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't matter.</v>

3799
01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:33.440
<v Speaker 3>They got rid of him.</v>

3800
01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:35.450
<v Speaker 3>He's effectively off of youtube.</v>

3801
01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:37.520
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

3802
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.770
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

3803
01:36:37.770 --> 01:36:38.810
<v Speaker 3>he's a well known funny guy.</v>

3804
01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:40.370
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't breaking the rules,</v>

3805
01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:40.821
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't,</v>

3806
01:36:40.821 --> 01:36:41.510
<v Speaker 3>but they still deleted,</v>

3807
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:42.380
<v Speaker 3>deleted his channel.</v>

3808
01:36:42.890 --> 01:36:46.640
<v Speaker 3>So I bring him up because I think it's worrisome that yes,</v>

3809
01:36:46.670 --> 01:36:47.690
<v Speaker 3>without an alternative,</v>

3810
01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:51.200
<v Speaker 3>you're career is wiped out in a second with no recourse and no reason why.</v>

3811
01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:55.310
<v Speaker 3>And the response they give you as it's our platform and you'll hear people say,</v>

3812
01:36:55.311 --> 01:36:55.401
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3813
01:36:55.401 --> 01:36:56.270
<v Speaker 3>but there are private business,</v>

3814
01:36:56.271 --> 01:36:57.380
<v Speaker 3>they can do what they want short,</v>

3815
01:36:57.381 --> 01:36:58.214
<v Speaker 3>but they're a monopoly.</v>

3816
01:36:58.460 --> 01:36:59.870
<v Speaker 3>We've got to have restrictions on that.</v>

3817
01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:00.863
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3818
01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:02.233
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3819
01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:02.611
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

3820
01:37:02.611 --> 01:37:05.310
<v Speaker 4>I have a question to ask here because I've had this conversation with some</v>

3821
01:37:05.311 --> 01:37:08.080
<v Speaker 4>friends of mine and this came up in like,</v>

3822
01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:08.401
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

3823
01:37:08.401 --> 01:37:11.100
<v Speaker 4>I guess the devil's advocate to this question because this happened with my</v>

3824
01:37:11.101 --> 01:37:11.490
<v Speaker 4>space.</v>

3825
01:37:11.490 --> 01:37:15.660
<v Speaker 4>My space still exists and there are people that had millions of followers on</v>

3826
01:37:15.661 --> 01:37:16.494
<v Speaker 4>that platform.</v>

3827
01:37:16.890 --> 01:37:21.030
<v Speaker 4>Are they owed something by my space because my space failed and their,</v>

3828
01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:24.270
<v Speaker 4>their accounts no longer have the clout that they once had.</v>

3829
01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:24.940
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3830
01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:25.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3831
01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:25.231
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

3832
01:37:25.231 --> 01:37:26.070
<v Speaker 4>So if for instance,</v>

3833
01:37:26.071 --> 01:37:27.030
<v Speaker 4>like if youtube failed,</v>

3834
01:37:27.031 --> 01:37:29.040
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow is pooty pie,</v>

3835
01:37:29.041 --> 01:37:32.110
<v Speaker 4>sue them because they've made bad business decisions and now for an issue.</v>

3836
01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:33.150
<v Speaker 4>Totally,</v>

3837
01:37:33.150 --> 01:37:33.820
<v Speaker 4>totally different.</v>

3838
01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:35.210
<v Speaker 4>I know that.</v>

3839
01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:37.560
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're sending the twitter account,</v>

3840
01:37:37.561 --> 01:37:41.880
<v Speaker 4>like they're not banning someone's ip address from using twitter.com and go into</v>

3841
01:37:41.881 --> 01:37:43.830
<v Speaker 4>c slash real Donald Trump and see what he's saying.</v>

3842
01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:44.730
<v Speaker 4>But listen,</v>

3843
01:37:44.730 --> 01:37:47.160
<v Speaker 4>your myspace failed because of alternatives.</v>

3844
01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.170
<v Speaker 4>Facebook became more prominent,</v>

3845
01:37:49.290 --> 01:37:50.160
<v Speaker 4>there was an option</v>

3846
01:37:50.690 --> 01:37:53.900
<v Speaker 3>and the other issue is monkey jones followed the rules.</v>

3847
01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:54.830
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

3848
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:55.670
<v Speaker 3>he told by youtube,</v>

3849
01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:56.670
<v Speaker 3>this is what you can and can't do anything.</v>

3850
01:37:56.690 --> 01:37:57.240
<v Speaker 3>You got it.</v>

3851
01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:58.560
<v Speaker 3>And then one day they just wiped him out.</v>

3852
01:37:58.710 --> 01:38:00.750
<v Speaker 3>and so then they'd never gave any explanation.</v>

3853
01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:02.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe so.</v>

3854
01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:04.920
<v Speaker 3>And it was reallY weird because,</v>

3855
01:38:05.010 --> 01:38:05.610
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

3856
01:38:05.610 --> 01:38:05.970
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3857
01:38:05.970 --> 01:38:06.781
<v Speaker 3>it's been a little while,</v>

3858
01:38:06.781 --> 01:38:07.531
<v Speaker 3>so I went over the story,</v>

3859
01:38:07.531 --> 01:38:10.620
<v Speaker 3>but there was a video he posted that was like a music video making fun of elliot</v>

3860
01:38:10.621 --> 01:38:11.040
<v Speaker 3>roger.</v>

3861
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:11.890
<v Speaker 3>He's that school that,</v>

3862
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:12.743
<v Speaker 3>that administrator guy,</v>

3863
01:38:13.190 --> 01:38:15.560
<v Speaker 3>it existed on different channels on other,</v>

3864
01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:18.870
<v Speaker 3>like another prominent channel it existed and they banned him and then he</v>

3865
01:38:18.871 --> 01:38:21.030
<v Speaker 3>brought up like why was it banned on mine?</v>

3866
01:38:21.031 --> 01:38:22.080
<v Speaker 3>But this one was approved.</v>

3867
01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:23.640
<v Speaker 3>and then a day later they band the other one.</v>

3868
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:25.120
<v Speaker 3>They copyright struck it.</v>

3869
01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:29.130
<v Speaker 3>The issue here is if there was an alternative to youtube you where you can</v>

3870
01:38:29.131 --> 01:38:29.670
<v Speaker 3>operate,</v>

3871
01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:30.240
<v Speaker 3>I'd be on it,</v>

3872
01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:30.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3873
01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:30.901
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3874
01:38:30.901 --> 01:38:31.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3875
01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:32.610
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I'll give a shout out,</v>

3876
01:38:32.670 --> 01:38:33.600
<v Speaker 3>I've been using minds,</v>

3877
01:38:33.630 --> 01:38:34.350
<v Speaker 3>am I mds?</v>

3878
01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:37.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually having build the guy that owns it.</v>

3879
01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:38.430
<v Speaker 3>How do you spell your last name?</v>

3880
01:38:38.431 --> 01:38:39.630
<v Speaker 3>Altman altman.</v>

3881
01:38:39.631 --> 01:38:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Bill altman's coming on soon.</v>

3882
01:38:41.190 --> 01:38:41.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

3883
01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:45.390
<v Speaker 3>I made a concerted effort after that podcast to reach out to a bunch of</v>

3884
01:38:45.391 --> 01:38:48.320
<v Speaker 3>different people and try to expand this conversation.</v>

3885
01:38:48.330 --> 01:38:51.670
<v Speaker 3>I want to have the guy from gab to gaps,</v>

3886
01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:52.890
<v Speaker 3>gaps in murky,</v>

3887
01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:53.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3888
01:38:53.310 --> 01:38:56.970
<v Speaker 3>a gab has been murky in terms of content but not really.</v>

3889
01:38:58.050 --> 01:38:58.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

3890
01:38:58.760 --> 01:38:59.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3891
01:38:59.130 --> 01:38:59.731
<v Speaker 3>so I did it.</v>

3892
01:38:59.731 --> 01:39:01.080
<v Speaker 3>I researched this a little bit.</v>

3893
01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:02.520
<v Speaker 3>If you look at their wikipedia page,</v>

3894
01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:03.960
<v Speaker 3>It's simple sourcing.</v>

3895
01:39:04.590 --> 01:39:05.570
<v Speaker 3>They um,</v>

3896
01:39:05.610 --> 01:39:06.960
<v Speaker 3>there was a study done on gab that found,</v>

3897
01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:10.320
<v Speaker 3>I think they only have like five percent of the posts are considered to be hate</v>

3898
01:39:10.321 --> 01:39:10.681
<v Speaker 3>speech,</v>

3899
01:39:10.681 --> 01:39:12.930
<v Speaker 3>whereas twitter is like two point three or something.</v>

3900
01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:16.200
<v Speaker 3>So gab is predominantly not hate speech,</v>

3901
01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.700
<v Speaker 3>not much more than twitter.</v>

3902
01:39:17.970 --> 01:39:20.220
<v Speaker 3>And when you consider that we're looking at percentages,</v>

3903
01:39:20.221 --> 01:39:23.730
<v Speaker 3>you can actually see that twitter is hate speech isn't the millions and gabs is</v>

3904
01:39:23.731 --> 01:39:24.870
<v Speaker 3>in the tens of thousands,</v>

3905
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:26.280
<v Speaker 3>but gab is run,</v>

3906
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:26.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3907
01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:27.210
<v Speaker 3>volume.</v>

3908
01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:28.290
<v Speaker 3>the media nonstop.</v>

3909
01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:28.890
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3910
01:39:28.890 --> 01:39:29.723
<v Speaker 3>Men,</v>

3911
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:32.040
<v Speaker 3>I think when it comes to youtube,</v>

3912
01:39:32.130 --> 01:39:32.730
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>

3913
01:39:32.730 --> 01:39:33.563
<v Speaker 3>I actually trust them.</v>

3914
01:39:33.630 --> 01:39:34.021
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>

3915
01:39:34.021 --> 01:39:34.854
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

3916
01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:38.730
<v Speaker 3>I think the reason they took on monkey is because the potential for a pr</v>

3917
01:39:38.731 --> 01:39:40.830
<v Speaker 3>backlash over his kind of content was so great.</v>

3918
01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:41.131
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

3919
01:39:41.131 --> 01:39:42.960
<v Speaker 3>we don't care and that's unfair and it's wrong.</v>

3920
01:39:42.961 --> 01:39:43.860
<v Speaker 3>I think they were wrong and do it,</v>

3921
01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:44.610
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3922
01:39:44.610 --> 01:39:45.900
<v Speaker 3>but you understand the motivation.</v>

3923
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:48.960
<v Speaker 3>I understand the motivation and I actually think youtube does more to protect</v>

3924
01:39:48.961 --> 01:39:51.120
<v Speaker 3>free speech on the internet than a lot of these other companies do.</v>

3925
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:52.290
<v Speaker 3>when a.</v>

3926
01:39:52.290 --> 01:39:52.950
<v Speaker 3>And I'll give you a few example.</v>

3927
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:53.180
<v Speaker 3>I'll get,</v>

3928
01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:55.770
<v Speaker 3>I'll get one good example is first of all,</v>

3929
01:39:55.771 --> 01:39:58.320
<v Speaker 3>when you're demonetized you still earn youtube red revenue,</v>

3930
01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.930
<v Speaker 3>so youtube still will,</v>

3931
01:40:01.050 --> 01:40:02.430
<v Speaker 3>like they're trying to pay you.</v>

3932
01:40:02.431 --> 01:40:03.264
<v Speaker 3>they want the money.</v>

3933
01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:04.613
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3934
01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:08.760
<v Speaker 3>with sargon avocado getting banned from patrion patrion banned him because they</v>

3935
01:40:08.761 --> 01:40:11.640
<v Speaker 3>said you used the naughty word on youtube eight months ago.</v>

3936
01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:13.040
<v Speaker 3>Youtube doesn't care.</v>

3937
01:40:13.041 --> 01:40:14.220
<v Speaker 3>He said the word right.</v>

3938
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:15.700
<v Speaker 3>Is that the pod where you called that?</v>

3939
01:40:15.890 --> 01:40:16.920
<v Speaker 3>The outright,</v>

3940
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:19.050
<v Speaker 3>the white end word you didn't care.</v>

3941
01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:20.031
<v Speaker 3>Youtube said it's,</v>

3942
01:40:20.031 --> 01:40:21.220
<v Speaker 3>it's fine on a platform that,</v>

3943
01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:21.720
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>

3944
01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:22.553
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>

3945
01:40:22.930 --> 01:40:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Pastry set the context and the context of which it was used to.</v>

3946
01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:28.710
<v Speaker 3>It just takes 30 seconds listening to it go,</v>

3947
01:40:28.711 --> 01:40:28.861
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3948
01:40:28.861 --> 01:40:29.610
<v Speaker 3>I see what he's doing.</v>

3949
01:40:29.610 --> 01:40:32.190
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's kind of a clunky use of the word.</v>

3950
01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:34.490
<v Speaker 3>He's not using it in a race racist,</v>

3951
01:40:34.650 --> 01:40:35.460
<v Speaker 3>racist way.</v>

3952
01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:36.420
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to,</v>

3953
01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:37.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3954
01:40:37.170 --> 01:40:37.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3955
01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:38.453
<v Speaker 3>actually this is,</v>

3956
01:40:38.670 --> 01:40:40.770
<v Speaker 3>he was trying to show how stupid they are,</v>

3957
01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:45.270
<v Speaker 3>but can we talk about the bias on twitter with sara jong who for three years</v>

3958
01:40:45.271 --> 01:40:48.780
<v Speaker 3>with posting anti white racist like mean spirited,</v>

3959
01:40:48.781 --> 01:40:49.411
<v Speaker 3>awful things.</v>

3960
01:40:49.411 --> 01:40:52.260
<v Speaker 3>And the excuse was she was using the language of our oppressors.</v>

3961
01:40:52.610 --> 01:40:53.050
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3962
01:40:53.050 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 3>Well we think sargon was doing.</v>

3963
01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:55.840
<v Speaker 2>He was using their language against them.</v>

3964
01:40:55.870 --> 01:40:56.411
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3965
01:40:56.411 --> 01:40:57.460
<v Speaker 2>They hire at the New York times.</v>

3966
01:40:57.490 --> 01:40:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3967
01:40:57.820 --> 01:40:58.120
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3968
01:40:58.120 --> 01:40:58.751
<v Speaker 2>that's terrifying.</v>

3969
01:40:58.751 --> 01:41:02.530
<v Speaker 2>And there was a huge backlash there and I don't want to take this opportunity</v>

3970
01:41:02.531 --> 01:41:02.631
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

3971
01:41:02.631 --> 01:41:03.850
<v Speaker 2>to point out media matters.</v>

3972
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:08.020
<v Speaker 2>There was when that thing went around the alternative influence network lying,</v>

3973
01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:11.830
<v Speaker 2>like there was a media matters wrote about it.</v>

3974
01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:15.130
<v Speaker 2>I politely reached out to the person who did and their response was,</v>

3975
01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:18.190
<v Speaker 2>I hope a bird poops on your head and it gets in your eyebrow and you smell like</v>

3976
01:41:18.191 --> 01:41:19.024
<v Speaker 2>farts.</v>

3977
01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:20.070
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

3978
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:21.670
<v Speaker 2>that's the response they gave me.</v>

3979
01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:22.540
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

3980
01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:23.373
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3981
01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:24.340
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3982
01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:25.360
<v Speaker 2>just want to give you a heads up.</v>

3983
01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:26.650
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot that's wrong in this report.</v>

3984
01:41:26.651 --> 01:41:27.280
<v Speaker 2>It's not true.</v>

3985
01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:28.690
<v Speaker 2>My dental hold these beliefs.</v>

3986
01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:30.010
<v Speaker 2>I've never had this individual.</v>

3987
01:41:30.011 --> 01:41:30.550
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>

3988
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:35.340
<v Speaker 2>that was the response to literal response was I hope a bird poops on your poops</v>

3989
01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:38.500
<v Speaker 2>on you and it falls into your eyebrow and you smell like a dirty farts or</v>

3990
01:41:38.501 --> 01:41:39.334
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3991
01:41:39.970 --> 01:41:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Then when I,</v>

3992
01:41:40.530 --> 01:41:40.980
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

3993
01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:41.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3994
01:41:41.230 --> 01:41:41.530
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3995
01:41:41.530 --> 01:41:42.363
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3996
01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:42.791
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

3997
01:41:42.791 --> 01:41:43.570
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

3998
01:41:43.570 --> 01:41:47.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean I got a hold of their fucking typewriter or keyboard rather than.</v>

3999
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.830
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

4000
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:52.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm the guy who started it was at a political and he and he set up on stage.</v>

4001
01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:56.620
<v Speaker 2>Fake news is predominantly it's.</v>

4002
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:57.623
<v Speaker 2>He said it's only,</v>

4003
01:41:57.910 --> 01:42:00.520
<v Speaker 2>it's only a phenomenon of the right to the left doesn't engage in conspiracies</v>

4004
01:42:00.521 --> 01:42:01.001
<v Speaker 2>and fake news,</v>

4005
01:42:01.001 --> 01:42:01.780
<v Speaker 2>which is nonsense.</v>

4006
01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:02.613
<v Speaker 2>Of course they do.</v>

4007
01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.240
<v Speaker 2>And I afterwards,</v>

4008
01:42:04.241 --> 01:42:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

4009
01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:08.170
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you then because one of your writers responded to me in this way and</v>

4010
01:42:08.171 --> 01:42:09.004
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

4011
01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:11.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about it and I can respond.</v>

4012
01:42:11.381 --> 01:42:12.940
<v Speaker 2>And then he walked off and I was like,</v>

4013
01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:14.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4014
01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I want to circle back to gab because I get what you were saying that the volume</v>

4015
01:42:17.411 --> 01:42:19.210
<v Speaker 2>is lower and that there's less</v>

4016
01:42:20.890 --> 01:42:21.690
<v Speaker 2>I read.</v>

4017
01:42:21.690 --> 01:42:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4018
01:42:22.050 --> 01:42:22.720
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

4019
01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.310
<v Speaker 2>what is your opinion of it though?</v>

4020
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:25.540
<v Speaker 2>You were kind of.</v>

4021
01:42:25.541 --> 01:42:26.740
<v Speaker 2>We kind of got sidetracked.</v>

4022
01:42:26.770 --> 01:42:26.921
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4023
01:42:26.921 --> 01:42:27.550
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

4024
01:42:27.550 --> 01:42:28.383
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

4025
01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:28.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4026
01:42:28.910 --> 01:42:29.351
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4027
01:42:29.351 --> 01:42:29.541
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4028
01:42:29.541 --> 01:42:31.810
<v Speaker 2>I can agree with the general notion,</v>

4029
01:42:32.050 --> 01:42:33.340
<v Speaker 2>the ideology of if it's legal,</v>

4030
01:42:33.341 --> 01:42:34.174
<v Speaker 2>it's allowed.</v>

4031
01:42:34.370 --> 01:42:34.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4032
01:42:34.710 --> 01:42:35.140
<v Speaker 2>and I would,</v>

4033
01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that,</v>

4034
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4035
01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:38.650
<v Speaker 2>what jack is trying to do with twitter or I would say him personally,</v>

4036
01:42:38.651 --> 01:42:41.050
<v Speaker 2>but what twitter is trying to do is what create like a comfy,</v>

4037
01:42:41.051 --> 01:42:43.080
<v Speaker 2>padded neon room for the kids to hang out at.</v>

4038
01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:43.240
<v Speaker 2>NoW.</v>

4039
01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:44.290
<v Speaker 2>The real world is harsh.</v>

4040
01:42:44.530 --> 01:42:46.390
<v Speaker 2>I think what they're trying to do,</v>

4041
01:42:46.450 --> 01:42:47.650
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to speak for him,</v>

4042
01:42:47.651 --> 01:42:50.710
<v Speaker 2>but I think they're trying to engineer the conversation to be more polite and</v>

4043
01:42:50.711 --> 01:42:52.660
<v Speaker 2>civil says who exactly,</v>

4044
01:42:52.710 --> 01:42:52.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4045
01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:53.181
<v Speaker 2>whose,</v>

4046
01:42:53.181 --> 01:42:53.891
<v Speaker 2>whose definition?</v>

4047
01:42:53.891 --> 01:42:54.724
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

4048
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:55.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

4049
01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:55.570
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

4050
01:42:55.570 --> 01:42:56.200
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

4051
01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:57.800
<v Speaker 2>I see so many of these people who just,</v>

4052
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:59.740
<v Speaker 2>they wield power and they're unaccountable.</v>

4053
01:43:00.230 --> 01:43:00.461
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4054
01:43:00.461 --> 01:43:03.550
<v Speaker 2>it's also you don't recognize the consequences of telling people what they can</v>

4055
01:43:03.551 --> 01:43:05.010
<v Speaker 2>and can't do and that it's.</v>

4056
01:43:05.070 --> 01:43:06.520
<v Speaker 2>This is a very slippery slope.</v>

4057
01:43:06.521 --> 01:43:07.720
<v Speaker 2>You running up a greased hill.</v>

4058
01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:08.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4059
01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:09.670
<v Speaker 2>and people don't like it.</v>

4060
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:11.900
<v Speaker 2>They don't like it and well the,</v>

4061
01:43:11.930 --> 01:43:13.060
<v Speaker 2>the thing is like</v>

4062
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:15.881
<v Speaker 2>when you see something,</v>

4063
01:43:15.881 --> 01:43:16.714
<v Speaker 2>like if,</v>

4064
01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:19.390
<v Speaker 2>if everything was just open,</v>

4065
01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:22.840
<v Speaker 2>what would the conversation be like if there was no banning,</v>

4066
01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:24.040
<v Speaker 2>if there was nothing,</v>

4067
01:43:24.370 --> 01:43:29.350
<v Speaker 2>it was just everything was real free speech you would have.</v>

4068
01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:30.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean if it was,</v>

4069
01:43:30.210 --> 01:43:31.660
<v Speaker 2>if it was impossible,</v>

4070
01:43:31.661 --> 01:43:32.494
<v Speaker 2>let's put it this way,</v>

4071
01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:36.880
<v Speaker 2>it was impossible to ban someone from any social media platform,</v>

4072
01:43:36.881 --> 01:43:39.160
<v Speaker 2>whether it's youtube or twitter or instagram.</v>

4073
01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:41.950
<v Speaker 2>What would the conversations look like?</v>

4074
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:46.780
<v Speaker 2>How much dIfferent would they be and would we maybe have a healthier way of</v>

4075
01:43:46.781 --> 01:43:47.614
<v Speaker 2>adjusting?</v>

4076
01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:49.090
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be worse,</v>

4077
01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:51.100
<v Speaker 2>worse because I could,</v>

4078
01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I could be temporary or in the long run,</v>

4079
01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:55.640
<v Speaker 2>maybe temporary,</v>

4080
01:43:55.670 --> 01:43:56.151
<v Speaker 2>but there,</v>

4081
01:43:56.151 --> 01:43:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's called the online inhibition effect.</v>

4082
01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Basically the opportunity to be anonymous online and the and the and the</v>

4083
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:04.160
<v Speaker 2>distance makes people.</v>

4084
01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:08.630
<v Speaker 2>They have no problem being their worst self and so I can understand what twitter</v>

4085
01:44:08.631 --> 01:44:09.350
<v Speaker 2>wants to do.</v>

4086
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.741
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

4087
01:44:09.741 --> 01:44:10.041
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4088
01:44:10.041 --> 01:44:12.950
<v Speaker 2>we need to figure out how we stop people from being mean all the time because</v>

4089
01:44:12.951 --> 01:44:13.600
<v Speaker 2>twitter is,</v>

4090
01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:16.430
<v Speaker 2>it's a hellscape of just mean people saying nothing but mean things,</v>

4091
01:44:16.670 --> 01:44:18.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's also again,</v>

4092
01:44:18.171 --> 01:44:20.360
<v Speaker 2>because they're anonymous and because it's possible.</v>

4093
01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:22.430
<v Speaker 2>But then look,</v>

4094
01:44:22.850 --> 01:44:23.830
<v Speaker 2>alex joneS can,</v>

4095
01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:25.520
<v Speaker 2>can say a bunch of really awful things.</v>

4096
01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:26.420
<v Speaker 2>It's his right to do so.</v>

4097
01:44:26.421 --> 01:44:26.901
<v Speaker 2>Should it be bent?</v>

4098
01:44:26.901 --> 01:44:27.734
<v Speaker 2>He shouldn't.</v>

4099
01:44:27.850 --> 01:44:28.091
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

4100
01:44:28.091 --> 01:44:30.440
<v Speaker 2>if so it does.</v>

4101
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Does Alex Jones?</v>

4102
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4103
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:33.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

4104
01:44:33.110 --> 01:44:34.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to directly accused him because I don't watch his show.</v>

4105
01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:38.310
<v Speaker 2>But if he goes on twitter and he says something that's deemed to be false shitty</v>

4106
01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:38.990
<v Speaker 2>band for that,</v>

4107
01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:39.890
<v Speaker 2>now if he,</v>

4108
01:44:39.891 --> 01:44:41.750
<v Speaker 2>if he challenges the journalists should be banned for that.</v>

4109
01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:42.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4110
01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:43.850
<v Speaker 2>because let me tell you,</v>

4111
01:44:43.970 --> 01:44:45.860
<v Speaker 2>because he says thIngs about me that aren't true.</v>

4112
01:44:46.670 --> 01:44:47.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it should be right.</v>

4113
01:44:48.110 --> 01:44:48.680
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

4114
01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:51.680
<v Speaker 2>and he's saying the things about me and I don't think he should be banned.</v>

4115
01:44:51.681 --> 01:44:53.540
<v Speaker 2>I think alex,</v>

4116
01:44:53.541 --> 01:44:54.380
<v Speaker 2>I think we should talk,</v>

4117
01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:55.940
<v Speaker 2>have a conversation.</v>

4118
01:44:56.210 --> 01:44:57.200
<v Speaker 2>I watched those videos.</v>

4119
01:44:58.580 --> 01:44:59.330
<v Speaker 2>He's upset,</v>

4120
01:44:59.330 --> 01:45:00.021
<v Speaker 2>he's upset,</v>

4121
01:45:00.021 --> 01:45:01.580
<v Speaker 2>and I get it in certain ways.</v>

4122
01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:05.510
<v Speaker 2>I get it and he thinks I took a shot at him and I get it and I probably did and</v>

4123
01:45:05.511 --> 01:45:06.344
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have.</v>

4124
01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:06.640
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

4125
01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:07.040
<v Speaker 2>So here's,</v>

4126
01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:07.520
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

4127
01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:07.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4128
01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:10.340
<v Speaker 2>my point is I don't think you should be banned.</v>

4129
01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4130
01:45:10.990 --> 01:45:11.823
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

4131
01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:13.190
<v Speaker 2>he's doing it at me.</v>

4132
01:45:13.370 --> 01:45:13.581
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4133
01:45:13.581 --> 01:45:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4134
01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:14.871
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4135
01:45:14.871 --> 01:45:17.330
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned those people from occupy who lie about me all the time.</v>

4136
01:45:17.331 --> 01:45:18.830
<v Speaker 2>They've posted the most ridiculous lies about me.</v>

4137
01:45:18.831 --> 01:45:19.780
<v Speaker 2>I still don't think it should be banned.</v>

4138
01:45:19.850 --> 01:45:20.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4139
01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Does.</v>

4140
01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:24.530
<v Speaker 2>The thing is if you ban them and then someone opposes them,</v>

4141
01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:28.730
<v Speaker 2>but then someone opposes the people who oppose them and they want them banned,</v>

4142
01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:31.310
<v Speaker 2>and then you have this fucking war back and forth,</v>

4143
01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:36.580
<v Speaker 2>and instead of fighting bad ideas or incorrect ideas with correct or good ideas,</v>

4144
01:45:37.730 --> 01:45:39.240
<v Speaker 2>now you just have people present.</v>

4145
01:45:39.250 --> 01:45:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Banhammer Is left and right and you're just trying to figure out who the</v>

4146
01:45:41.421 --> 01:45:43.340
<v Speaker 2>majority is so you can side with the biggest group,</v>

4147
01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:46.910
<v Speaker 2>but then you're trying to virtue signal and you're trying to get something that</v>

4148
01:45:46.911 --> 01:45:48.230
<v Speaker 2>supports your ideology,</v>

4149
01:45:48.231 --> 01:45:49.250
<v Speaker 2>whether it's right or left.</v>

4150
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.420
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

4151
01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:50.510
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing with jones though,</v>

4152
01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:55.100
<v Speaker 2>if the people on the left one to argue that he is making the platform worse and</v>

4153
01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:55.993
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>

4154
01:45:56.130 --> 01:45:58.040
<v Speaker 2>I understand that and I recognize,</v>

4155
01:45:58.041 --> 01:45:59.000
<v Speaker 2>well that's unfortunate,</v>

4156
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4157
01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:00.380
<v Speaker 2>This is the real world.</v>

4158
01:46:00.381 --> 01:46:01.820
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes people say things you don't like,</v>

4159
01:46:02.210 --> 01:46:03.043
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly,</v>

4160
01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:04.820
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people argued that when he,</v>

4161
01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:05.713
<v Speaker 2>when he said that,</v>

4162
01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:06.980
<v Speaker 2>he said something about sandy hook,</v>

4163
01:46:06.981 --> 01:46:07.461
<v Speaker 2>which again,</v>

4164
01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:08.510
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen the videos but they've,</v>

4165
01:46:08.770 --> 01:46:10.070
<v Speaker 2>they've been sued.</v>

4166
01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:10.641
<v Speaker 2>They said that.</v>

4167
01:46:10.641 --> 01:46:11.270
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

4168
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:12.103
<v Speaker 2>daniel never happened.</v>

4169
01:46:13.010 --> 01:46:13.550
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4170
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:15.500
<v Speaker 2>so what is fake news to be banned?</v>

4171
01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:16.790
<v Speaker 2>While many people were saying,</v>

4172
01:46:16.791 --> 01:46:17.091
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

4173
01:46:17.091 --> 01:46:18.320
<v Speaker 2>facebook needs to ban a fake news.</v>

4174
01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.280
<v Speaker 2>But think about what that means.</v>

4175
01:46:19.281 --> 01:46:20.390
<v Speaker 2>It means you're not allowed to be wrong.</v>

4176
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:21.171
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

4177
01:46:21.171 --> 01:46:23.240
<v Speaker 2>Because fake news doesn't mean you did it on purpose.</v>

4178
01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:24.313
<v Speaker 2>More importantly,</v>

4179
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:25.370
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to be stupid.</v>

4180
01:46:25.810 --> 01:46:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4181
01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:28.550
<v Speaker 2>here's another thing again in defense of alex,</v>

4182
01:46:28.670 --> 01:46:32.870
<v Speaker 2>one thing that alex did do is in the future after,</v>

4183
01:46:32.871 --> 01:46:35.840
<v Speaker 2>after he was done saying the things that he said about sandy hook,</v>

4184
01:46:35.841 --> 01:46:38.180
<v Speaker 2>he then said it definitely happened.</v>

4185
01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:41.090
<v Speaker 2>So he corrected his course and there's no.</v>

4186
01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Is there a path for redemption when you correct your course and if there's not,</v>

4187
01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:46.581
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing?</v>

4188
01:46:46.581 --> 01:46:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Because we're not treating people like human beings.</v>

4189
01:46:48.321 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Then whether it's my</v>

4190
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:51.990
<v Speaker 3>low or whether it's anybody.</v>

4191
01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:53.073
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4192
01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:58.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry to cut you off at the path to redemption is so fucking critical.</v>

4193
01:46:58.110 --> 01:46:58.860
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

4194
01:46:58.860 --> 01:46:59.693
<v Speaker 3>so let me tell you,</v>

4195
01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:00.753
<v Speaker 3>I went to Sweden.</v>

4196
01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:04.240
<v Speaker 3>People were claiming things were happening in Sweden a couple of years ago.</v>

4197
01:47:04.241 --> 01:47:05.250
<v Speaker 3>I decided to go check it out.</v>

4198
01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:08.220
<v Speaker 3>For some reason a bunch of people believe that I pushed them far right?</v>

4199
01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Far right wing conspiracy when I actually pushed him.</v>

4200
01:47:11.410 --> 01:47:11.940
<v Speaker 3>What was that?</v>

4201
01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:14.550
<v Speaker 3>You pushed a conspiracy theory or theory.</v>

4202
01:47:14.930 --> 01:47:15.120
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4203
01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:15.301
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

4204
01:47:15.301 --> 01:47:15.690
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

4205
01:47:15.690 --> 01:47:18.750
<v Speaker 3>So basically you had Donald Trump said last night in Sweden,</v>

4206
01:47:19.230 --> 01:47:20.070
<v Speaker 3>as soon as he says this,</v>

4207
01:47:20.071 --> 01:47:20.940
<v Speaker 3>the media goes wild.</v>

4208
01:47:21.690 --> 01:47:24.810
<v Speaker 3>My friend and I and my friend emily who works with me on an off set,</v>

4209
01:47:24.811 --> 01:47:25.290
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>

4210
01:47:25.290 --> 01:47:27.810
<v Speaker 3>we should just go to Sweden and just like walk around film stuff and make a</v>

4211
01:47:27.811 --> 01:47:32.490
<v Speaker 3>video about what we experienced was that to go almost immediately it's reported.</v>

4212
01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:33.413
<v Speaker 3>We found nothing.</v>

4213
01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:35.160
<v Speaker 3>We found the neighborhoods were actually very nice,</v>

4214
01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:36.870
<v Speaker 3>substantially nicer than chicago,</v>

4215
01:47:36.871 --> 01:47:40.050
<v Speaker 3>but we did find there was an increase in crime is very tepid for some reason now</v>

4216
01:47:40.051 --> 01:47:42.450
<v Speaker 3>people are claiming that like I'm pushing conspiracies or something.</v>

4217
01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:43.801
<v Speaker 3>I was going to go somewhere that,</v>

4218
01:47:43.801 --> 01:47:45.180
<v Speaker 3>but I kind of lost my train of thought.</v>

4219
01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:46.320
<v Speaker 3>Had a.</v>

4220
01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:47.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4221
01:47:47.010 --> 01:47:47.191
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4222
01:47:47.191 --> 01:47:48.024
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>

4223
01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:48.893
<v Speaker 3>When I was there,</v>

4224
01:47:48.930 --> 01:47:50.730
<v Speaker 3>joey salads is a big youtuber.</v>

4225
01:47:51.330 --> 01:47:52.980
<v Speaker 3>Reached out to me on twitter saying,</v>

4226
01:47:52.981 --> 01:47:53.131
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4227
01:47:53.131 --> 01:47:54.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm here to let's meet up.</v>

4228
01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:58.740
<v Speaker 3>I got really angry because joey salads made a video I think a couple years ago</v>

4229
01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:03.150
<v Speaker 3>where he staged a bunch of black guys destroying a car to make it seem like</v>

4230
01:48:03.330 --> 01:48:03.751
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

4231
01:48:03.751 --> 01:48:06.600
<v Speaker 3>these neighborhoods where black people were going to destroy trump car and it</v>

4232
01:48:06.601 --> 01:48:06.901
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

4233
01:48:06.901 --> 01:48:08.340
<v Speaker 3>it was very racist as awful.</v>

4234
01:48:08.341 --> 01:48:09.174
<v Speaker 3>Horrible.</v>

4235
01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:09.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4236
01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:13.530
<v Speaker 3>He's a big youtuber and so he reached out to me and I got really pissed.</v>

4237
01:48:13.530 --> 01:48:13.711
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4238
01:48:13.711 --> 01:48:13.950
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

4239
01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:15.090
<v Speaker 3>you're fake news.</v>

4240
01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:16.440
<v Speaker 3>You're a racist.</v>

4241
01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:17.251
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

4242
01:48:17.251 --> 01:48:17.670
<v Speaker 3>and I just,</v>

4243
01:48:17.670 --> 01:48:18.750
<v Speaker 3>I started cussing at him.</v>

4244
01:48:18.810 --> 01:48:20.820
<v Speaker 3>I was like this and that's not normal for me,</v>

4245
01:48:20.821 --> 01:48:21.110
<v Speaker 3>but that.</v>

4246
01:48:21.110 --> 01:48:22.980
<v Speaker 3>But afterwards I kind of realized something.</v>

4247
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:24.833
<v Speaker 3>Joey made a mistake,</v>

4248
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:26.670
<v Speaker 3>he reached out to me.</v>

4249
01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:27.510
<v Speaker 3>It was polite.</v>

4250
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:28.260
<v Speaker 3>He was honest.</v>

4251
01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:29.100
<v Speaker 3>I think he did something really,</v>

4252
01:48:29.101 --> 01:48:29.934
<v Speaker 3>really bad.</v>

4253
01:48:30.090 --> 01:48:30.960
<v Speaker 3>If I tell him,</v>

4254
01:48:31.230 --> 01:48:32.070
<v Speaker 3>if I've cussed them out,</v>

4255
01:48:32.071 --> 01:48:33.210
<v Speaker 3>if I just be mean to him,</v>

4256
01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:34.373
<v Speaker 3>what's he going to do?</v>

4257
01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:36.240
<v Speaker 3>The Only people who will accept him.</v>

4258
01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:39.240
<v Speaker 3>If the only people are going to be nice to him or the actual racists will,</v>

4259
01:48:39.241 --> 01:48:41.040
<v Speaker 3>then he's going to go to the racists.</v>

4260
01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:42.630
<v Speaker 3>He needs a path to redemption.</v>

4261
01:48:42.631 --> 01:48:42.900
<v Speaker 3>So I.</v>

4262
01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:44.970
<v Speaker 3>So I apologized and I said that was wrong.</v>

4263
01:48:44.971 --> 01:48:45.804
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't have done that.</v>

4264
01:48:46.110 --> 01:48:46.501
<v Speaker 3>I should.</v>

4265
01:48:46.501 --> 01:48:49.230
<v Speaker 3>I should be willing to hear you out and I should give you an opportunity to</v>

4266
01:48:49.231 --> 01:48:49.920
<v Speaker 3>better yourself.</v>

4267
01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:50.790
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you won't.</v>

4268
01:48:51.210 --> 01:48:52.680
<v Speaker 3>And then I Met up with them and talk to them and I.</v>

4269
01:48:52.970 --> 01:48:54.630
<v Speaker 3>And I think he made a huge mistake.</v>

4270
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:55.681
<v Speaker 3>I think what he did was wrong.</v>

4271
01:48:55.681 --> 01:48:56.790
<v Speaker 3>I think it was self motivated.</v>

4272
01:48:56.791 --> 01:48:57.960
<v Speaker 3>I think it was money motivated,</v>

4273
01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:00.300
<v Speaker 3>but I think none of that matters.</v>

4274
01:49:00.301 --> 01:49:02.790
<v Speaker 3>All that matters is you tell them you do this one more time.</v>

4275
01:49:02.930 --> 01:49:03.161
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>

4276
01:49:03.161 --> 01:49:03.510
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

4277
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:04.343
<v Speaker 3>you're out.</v>

4278
01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:05.280
<v Speaker 3>You're out with the wolves.</v>

4279
01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:06.091
<v Speaker 3>But if you,</v>

4280
01:49:06.091 --> 01:49:09.690
<v Speaker 3>if you agree to do the right thing and you're willing and you're sincere than.</v>

4281
01:49:09.691 --> 01:49:10.524
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

4282
01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:11.413
<v Speaker 3>good for you.</v>

4283
01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:13.830
<v Speaker 3>I think that's got to be a part of the conversation.</v>

4284
01:49:14.140 --> 01:49:14.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4285
01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:15.173
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>

4286
01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:18.600
<v Speaker 3>I think this idea of just banning people for life,</v>

4287
01:49:18.750 --> 01:49:23.340
<v Speaker 3>but letting people out of jail after they commit murder and they can reenter</v>

4288
01:49:23.341 --> 01:49:24.174
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

4289
01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:25.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's still as hard for them for a long time.</v>

4290
01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:26.670
<v Speaker 3>Like exxon show,</v>

4291
01:49:26.670 --> 01:49:27.391
<v Speaker 3>it's not easy,</v>

4292
01:49:27.391 --> 01:49:29.880
<v Speaker 3>but they're saying that there's a path to redemption.</v>

4293
01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:32.540
<v Speaker 3>But what ends up happening is they create parallel economies.</v>

4294
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:35.880
<v Speaker 3>They create parallel networks and that causes more division,</v>

4295
01:49:35.881 --> 01:49:36.714
<v Speaker 3>more anxiety.</v>

4296
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Like you see,</v>

4297
01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:40.810
<v Speaker 3>you see these alternative social networks emerge because People get banned.</v>

4298
01:49:40.811 --> 01:49:41.850
<v Speaker 3>So they all moved to one place.</v>

4299
01:49:41.851 --> 01:49:42.810
<v Speaker 3>This is back to gab.</v>

4300
01:49:43.130 --> 01:49:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4301
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:43.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4302
01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:44.640
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4303
01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:45.091
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

4304
01:49:45.091 --> 01:49:47.530
<v Speaker 3>I think gab is mostly gotta be honest.</v>

4305
01:49:47.531 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't surf</v>

4306
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.730
<v Speaker 2>gab.</v>

4307
01:49:48.730 --> 01:49:49.460
<v Speaker 2>I've read what they've,</v>

4308
01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:50.230
<v Speaker 2>people have said about it,</v>

4309
01:49:50.230 --> 01:49:52.960
<v Speaker 2>but at this point I don't trust a lot of the media.</v>

4310
01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

4311
01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:54.760
<v Speaker 2>And that's not unique for me.</v>

4312
01:49:54.761 --> 01:49:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Most americans have unfavorable gab or you mean everything,</v>

4313
01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:00.060
<v Speaker 2>what they've said about gab and everything,</v>

4314
01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:00.431
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4315
01:50:00.431 --> 01:50:00.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4316
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:02.240
<v Speaker 2>what's your opinion of gay?</v>

4317
01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:03.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4318
01:50:03.170 --> 01:50:04.870
<v Speaker 2>you don't have like a clear opinion of it.</v>

4319
01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:07.810
<v Speaker 2>My opinion of gab is that they do allow.</v>

4320
01:50:08.150 --> 01:50:11.610
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot more people with extreme views simply because it's illegal.</v>

4321
01:50:11.670 --> 01:50:11.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4322
01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:12.880
<v Speaker 2>So they go there naturally,</v>

4323
01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:17.140
<v Speaker 2>but based on what I've read about it from like actual reports,</v>

4324
01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:19.270
<v Speaker 2>it's not substantially worse than twitter,</v>

4325
01:50:19.570 --> 01:50:21.970
<v Speaker 2>but it does allow them as a big difference,</v>

4326
01:50:21.971 --> 01:50:22.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4327
01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:22.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4328
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:23.620
<v Speaker 2>You can go on twitter,</v>

4329
01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:24.620
<v Speaker 2>you can get away with it for awhile.</v>

4330
01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Gab,</v>

4331
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:28.480
<v Speaker 2>you just go on gab and save a bunch of crazy stuff and unless you break the law,</v>

4332
01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:31.690
<v Speaker 2>there have been accusations leveled against gap that they've actually dragged</v>

4333
01:50:31.691 --> 01:50:34.360
<v Speaker 2>their feet on getting rid of illegal things like calls for violence,</v>

4334
01:50:34.690 --> 01:50:35.523
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4335
01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:39.750
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part some things that you cAn get kicked off or like doxing</v>

4336
01:50:39.890 --> 01:50:40.590
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

4337
01:50:40.590 --> 01:50:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4338
01:50:40.850 --> 01:50:42.910
<v Speaker 2>so that it's not the wild west,</v>

4339
01:50:42.911 --> 01:50:44.320
<v Speaker 2>but it's wilder.</v>

4340
01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:44.801
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

4341
01:50:44.801 --> 01:50:45.350
<v Speaker 2>what the media,</v>

4342
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:46.041
<v Speaker 2>these people and,</v>

4343
01:50:46.041 --> 01:50:46.171
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4344
01:50:46.171 --> 01:50:47.080
<v Speaker 2>and I want to say the media,</v>

4345
01:50:47.081 --> 01:50:50.410
<v Speaker 2>I specifically mean these digital New York based outlets for the most part,</v>

4346
01:50:51.010 --> 01:50:52.480
<v Speaker 2>they like to say things like,</v>

4347
01:50:52.481 --> 01:50:52.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4348
01:50:52.631 --> 01:50:53.920
<v Speaker 2>that guy who shot up at synagogue,</v>

4349
01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.120

01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:57.490
<v Speaker 2>But they say gab user.</v>

4429
01:52:17.050 --> 01:52:18.250
<v Speaker 2>from antifa or something.</v>

4430
01:52:18.251 --> 01:52:19.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily.</v>

4431
01:52:19.780 --> 01:52:21.310
<v Speaker 2>So she's had her share,</v>

4432
01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:22.300
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

4433
01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:22.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4434
01:52:22.650 --> 01:52:24.370
<v Speaker 2>She's been busted doing that too.</v>

4435
01:52:24.670 --> 01:52:29.020
<v Speaker 2>She's got caught with the antifa</v>

4436
01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:32.740
<v Speaker 2>antifa post on a wall that was like,</v>

4437
01:52:32.890 --> 01:52:33.281
<v Speaker 2>oh really?</v>

4438
01:52:33.281 --> 01:52:34.114
<v Speaker 2>It was a troll,</v>

4439
01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:34.750
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>

4440
01:52:34.750 --> 01:52:35.590
<v Speaker 2>somebody told it,</v>

4441
01:52:35.710 --> 01:52:36.543
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

4442
01:52:36.690 --> 01:52:40.240
<v Speaker 2>that's what's so crazy is that things are so fucking blurry.</v>

4443
01:52:40.450 --> 01:52:42.370
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to see the troll sometimes.</v>

4444
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4445
01:52:43.330 --> 01:52:44.800
<v Speaker 2>And so there in lies the big problem.</v>

4446
01:52:44.801 --> 01:52:45.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4447
01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 2>my brother might be</v>

4448
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.770
<v Speaker 3>one of the most notorious,</v>

4449
01:52:49.010 --> 01:52:50.660
<v Speaker 3>not notorious the wrong word because he,</v>

4450
01:52:50.661 --> 01:52:52.040
<v Speaker 3>he like of hides in the shadows,</v>

4451
01:52:52.041 --> 01:52:53.210
<v Speaker 3>but he's done some.</v>

4452
01:52:53.250 --> 01:52:55.620
<v Speaker 3>My brother cloned a while,</v>

4453
01:52:55.670 --> 01:52:56.570
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember which website.</v>

4454
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:58.190
<v Speaker 3>He cloned a website,</v>

4455
01:52:58.760 --> 01:52:59.001
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4456
01:52:59.001 --> 01:53:00.410
<v Speaker 3>The actually the yes man recently did this.</v>

4457
01:53:00.411 --> 01:53:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Well we can post copied perfectly and he wrote an article about how a new strain</v>

4458
01:53:05.091 --> 01:53:06.230
<v Speaker 3>of marijuana was discovered.</v>

4459
01:53:06.231 --> 01:53:06.680
<v Speaker 3>Cannabis,</v>

4460
01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:07.513
<v Speaker 3>australia's.</v>

4461
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:11.720
<v Speaker 3>He said that he was the dean at the university of sydney or something like that.</v>

4462
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:13.640
<v Speaker 3>Who was dating popstar meghan trainor,</v>

4463
01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:16.760
<v Speaker 3>just the most ridiculous thing and that he said,</v>

4464
01:53:16.761 --> 01:53:18.560
<v Speaker 3>we need to find a female plant.</v>

4465
01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:19.640
<v Speaker 3>So far this what we have.</v>

4466
01:53:19.641 --> 01:53:20.540
<v Speaker 3>It's groundbreaking.</v>

4467
01:53:21.170 --> 01:53:22.240
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

4468
01:53:22.290 --> 01:53:23.123
<v Speaker 3>so he did this very,</v>

4469
01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:24.113
<v Speaker 3>very clever thing.</v>

4470
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:29.350
<v Speaker 3>He bought a domain name that was something like calm-guest.info.</v>

4471
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:30.763
<v Speaker 3>That's the url.</v>

4472
01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:32.540
<v Speaker 3>He then created a subdomain.</v>

4473
01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:33.591
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

4474
01:53:33.591 --> 01:53:33.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4475
01:53:33.861 --> 01:53:35.750
<v Speaker 3>just hypothetically cnn.com,</v>

4476
01:53:35.810 --> 01:53:36.643
<v Speaker 3>dasha gassed,</v>

4477
01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:38.420
<v Speaker 3>the average person just see cnn.com.</v>

4478
01:53:38.810 --> 01:53:39.740
<v Speaker 3>They assume It's real.</v>

4479
01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:41.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how he shared it,</v>

4480
01:53:41.301 --> 01:53:42.320
<v Speaker 3>but he makes this whole.</v>

4481
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:43.340
<v Speaker 3>It's so ridiculous,</v>

4482
01:53:43.341 --> 01:53:43.491
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4483
01:53:43.491 --> 01:53:44.930
<v Speaker 3>I got to say if you thought it was real.</v>

4484
01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:47.810
<v Speaker 3>I got a bridge cellular high times picked it up.</v>

4485
01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:50.300
<v Speaker 3>It got 50,000 shares,</v>

4486
01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:51.163
<v Speaker 3>breakthrough,</v>

4487
01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:52.290
<v Speaker 3>new strain of marijuana.</v>

4488
01:53:52.291 --> 01:53:52.640
<v Speaker 3>Discovered.</v>

4489
01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:53.960
<v Speaker 3>My brother was just laughing the whole time.</v>

4490
01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:54.980
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

4491
01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:56.053
<v Speaker 3>what did you do?</v>

4492
01:53:56.150 --> 01:53:57.210
<v Speaker 3>Like my brothers,</v>

4493
01:53:57.230 --> 01:53:58.063
<v Speaker 3>like my opposite,</v>

4494
01:53:58.190 --> 01:53:58.431
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4495
01:53:58.431 --> 01:53:58.590
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4496
01:53:58.590 --> 01:54:00.620
<v Speaker 3>I try to be honest to the best of my ability.</v>

4497
01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:01.090
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4498
01:54:01.090 --> 01:54:01.460
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

4499
01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:01.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4500
01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:02.340
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

4501
01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:02.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4502
01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:03.620
<v Speaker 3>people accused me of being a liar.</v>

4503
01:54:03.621 --> 01:54:04.161
<v Speaker 3>That's not fair.</v>

4504
01:54:04.161 --> 01:54:05.450
<v Speaker 3>I could be wrong for sure,</v>

4505
01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:07.220
<v Speaker 3>but I try my best to be rational.</v>

4506
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:10.760
<v Speaker 3>My brother on the other hand is like editing videos,</v>

4507
01:54:10.761 --> 01:54:11.990
<v Speaker 3>making them ridiculous as possible.</v>

4508
01:54:11.991 --> 01:54:13.340
<v Speaker 3>He made another video where,</v>

4509
01:54:14.210 --> 01:54:16.040
<v Speaker 3>and it's crazy because he tries to make sure people.</v>

4510
01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:17.270
<v Speaker 3>It's over the top.</v>

4511
01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:20.690
<v Speaker 3>He made a video where it's a van getting pulled over.</v>

4512
01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:25.010
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a police dash cam and then the cop walks up to the car,</v>

4513
01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:26.360
<v Speaker 3>checks the guys licensed,</v>

4514
01:54:26.361 --> 01:54:26.930
<v Speaker 3>walks back,</v>

4515
01:54:26.930 --> 01:54:30.090
<v Speaker 3>and the driver releases pot on a balloon and then an airport,</v>

4516
01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:31.070
<v Speaker 3>so it saying stash,</v>

4517
01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:33.100
<v Speaker 3>like he's disposing ms drugs with helium balloons,</v>

4518
01:54:33.101 --> 01:54:35.870
<v Speaker 3>so they fly away and then the cop runs up firing guns,</v>

4519
01:54:35.871 --> 01:54:36.770
<v Speaker 3>edit this thing,</v>

4520
01:54:36.771 --> 01:54:38.030
<v Speaker 3>got hundreds of millions of views.</v>

4521
01:54:38.210 --> 01:54:39.740
<v Speaker 3>It was on facebook every other day.</v>

4522
01:54:39.741 --> 01:54:40.550
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

4523
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:44.720
<v Speaker 3>It was like he made it four years ago or something and I saw it on instagram</v>

4524
01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:46.100
<v Speaker 3>like two weeks ago and I was like,</v>

4525
01:54:46.101 --> 01:54:46.341
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

4526
01:54:46.341 --> 01:54:47.174
<v Speaker 3>And I showed him.</v>

4527
01:54:47.210 --> 01:54:48.140
<v Speaker 3>People think it's real.</v>

4528
01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:49.161
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>

4529
01:54:49.161 --> 01:54:50.180
<v Speaker 3>it's the craziest,</v>

4530
01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:51.210
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

4531
01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:52.240
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

4532
01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4533
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:52.940
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

4534
01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:53.241
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4535
01:54:53.241 --> 01:54:55.700
<v Speaker 3>so much fucked up stuff that is real.</v>

4536
01:54:55.701 --> 01:54:57.830
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard to differentiate what I mean.</v>

4537
01:54:57.920 --> 01:54:58.570
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

4538
01:54:58.570 --> 01:54:58.941
<v Speaker 3>Like let's,</v>

4539
01:54:58.941 --> 01:55:00.290
<v Speaker 3>let's throw some shade at high times.</v>

4540
01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Like when they did this,</v>

4541
01:55:02.230 --> 01:55:03.380
<v Speaker 3>they said they,</v>

4542
01:55:03.410 --> 01:55:05.000
<v Speaker 3>when they corrected the article and saying it was a hoax,</v>

4543
01:55:05.001 --> 01:55:07.610
<v Speaker 3>they said we wanted to call for verification,</v>

4544
01:55:07.611 --> 01:55:09.530
<v Speaker 3>but we thought the story was too hot to pass up.</v>

4545
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.510
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good example,</v>

4546
01:55:11.690 --> 01:55:13.160
<v Speaker 3>but that's a really good example of covington.</v>

4547
01:55:13.161 --> 01:55:15.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a really good example of what these news organizations do.</v>

4548
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:17.060
<v Speaker 3>It's high times.</v>

4549
01:55:17.061 --> 01:55:18.340
<v Speaker 3>There were probably barbecue,</v>

4550
01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:20.240
<v Speaker 3>that mother fucking mind when they wrote that,</v>

4551
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:21.730
<v Speaker 3>and I say like,</v>

4552
01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:22.280
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>

4553
01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:22.911
<v Speaker 3>they're not the,</v>

4554
01:55:22.911 --> 01:55:23.101
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4555
01:55:23.101 --> 01:55:24.470
<v Speaker 3>the bastions of great journalism.</v>

4556
01:55:24.471 --> 01:55:26.900
<v Speaker 3>We don't hold high times on a pedestal next to the New York times.</v>

4557
01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:29.390
<v Speaker 3>Not to be disrespectful and I respect the publication,</v>

4558
01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:31.430
<v Speaker 3>but the New York times is the paper of record.</v>

4559
01:55:31.450 --> 01:55:31.910
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4560
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:32.630
<v Speaker 3>At the same time,</v>

4561
01:55:32.630 --> 01:55:35.330
<v Speaker 3>if it's your job and you're writing stories on a specialty,</v>

4562
01:55:35.331 --> 01:55:35.511
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4563
01:55:35.511 --> 01:55:36.280
<v Speaker 3>come on man,</v>

4564
01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:36.861
<v Speaker 3>but look,</v>

4565
01:55:36.861 --> 01:55:37.460
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

4566
01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:38.190
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

4567
01:55:38.190 --> 01:55:38.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4568
01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:39.140
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

4569
01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:41.810
<v Speaker 3>there's two big things that affect media that I think are worrisome.</v>

4570
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:45.240
<v Speaker 3>Covington exemplifies really well that people just wrote,</v>

4571
01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:47.810
<v Speaker 3>they didn't do any research at all and it was all,</v>

4572
01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:48.713
<v Speaker 3>it was all wrong.</v>

4573
01:55:48.810 --> 01:55:51.270
<v Speaker 3>Then even watch the videos because you can see in the first video,</v>

4574
01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:52.110
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>

4575
01:55:52.110 --> 01:55:56.160
<v Speaker 3>but what's even more egregious as they did this several days right afterwards</v>

4576
01:55:56.161 --> 01:55:57.780
<v Speaker 3>and they were still like the bill maher thing.</v>

4577
01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:58.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4578
01:55:58.510 --> 01:55:59.760
<v Speaker 3>It's very unfortunate.</v>

4579
01:56:00.030 --> 01:56:03.930
<v Speaker 3>But then it's all avoidable if you're going to discuss something and you're</v>

4580
01:56:03.931 --> 01:56:07.770
<v Speaker 3>going to do it in a public forum like that and you know about it in advance.</v>

4581
01:56:07.771 --> 01:56:10.570
<v Speaker 3>This is not like you're on a podcast ad libbing and you,</v>

4582
01:56:10.590 --> 01:56:11.890
<v Speaker 3>you say something and you mistake.</v>

4583
01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:13.530
<v Speaker 3>This is something that's planned.</v>

4584
01:56:13.770 --> 01:56:17.190
<v Speaker 3>The other thing that worries me greatly is what we see with,</v>

4585
01:56:17.850 --> 01:56:18.200
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

4586
01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:18.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4587
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:19.021
<v Speaker 3>learn to code,</v>

4588
01:56:19.021 --> 01:56:19.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4589
01:56:19.590 --> 01:56:22.170
<v Speaker 3>so this nbc reporter is,</v>

4590
01:56:22.171 --> 01:56:25.080
<v Speaker 3>he goes on this big twitter thread about how twitter needs to take action</v>

4591
01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:26.580
<v Speaker 3>against these harassment campaigns.</v>

4592
01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:27.450
<v Speaker 3>And they refuSed to do it.</v>

4593
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:31.890
<v Speaker 3>The next day he writes an article citing an activist about how,</v>

4594
01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:32.041
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4595
01:56:32.041 --> 01:56:35.000
<v Speaker 3>far right campaign and sending death threats to journalists and twitters and</v>

4596
01:56:35.001 --> 01:56:35.834
<v Speaker 3>doing anything about it.</v>

4597
01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:40.110
<v Speaker 3>And after that he starts posting about how he's getting death threats adapter</v>

4598
01:56:40.111 --> 01:56:42.030
<v Speaker 3>that twitter announces they'll take action.</v>

4599
01:56:42.450 --> 01:56:43.410
<v Speaker 3>So what do we see here?</v>

4600
01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.120
<v Speaker 3>This guy called fraction,</v>

4601
01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:46.013
<v Speaker 3>couldn't get it done,</v>

4602
01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:47.100
<v Speaker 3>wrote an article,</v>

4603
01:56:47.130 --> 01:56:49.980
<v Speaker 3>slanting it as a far right campaign against journalists.</v>

4604
01:56:50.190 --> 01:56:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Twitter decides to take action.</v>

4605
01:56:51.450 --> 01:56:52.830
<v Speaker 3>Now people are getting banned for tweeting.</v>

4606
01:56:52.831 --> 01:56:53.660
<v Speaker 3>Learn to code.</v>

4607
01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:56.400
<v Speaker 3>This is people do think or making these critical decisions.</v>

4608
01:56:56.880 --> 01:56:57.720
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a handful.</v>

4609
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.961
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4610
01:56:57.961 --> 01:56:59.850
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine twitter's got a massive staff,</v>

4611
01:57:00.210 --> 01:57:03.690
<v Speaker 3>but like when you think they have a huge staff,</v>

4612
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:03.960
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

4613
01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:04.793
<v Speaker 3>Couple hundred?</v>

4614
01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:10.530
<v Speaker 3>There's a hundred offices and roughly 3,500 employees at those.</v>

4615
01:57:10.830 --> 01:57:10.981
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4616
01:57:10.981 --> 01:57:11.251
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

4617
01:57:11.251 --> 01:57:12.180
<v Speaker 3>So way more than I thought that was.</v>

4618
01:57:12.330 --> 01:57:12.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4619
01:57:12.661 --> 01:57:14.100
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was 35 offices.</v>

4620
01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:17.100
<v Speaker 3>How many of those people are operating in the bubble during.</v>

4621
01:57:17.101 --> 01:57:18.540
<v Speaker 3>In an ideological bubble,</v>

4622
01:57:18.570 --> 01:57:19.403
<v Speaker 3>but it's not just that,</v>

4623
01:57:19.770 --> 01:57:20.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4624
01:57:20.250 --> 01:57:21.180
<v Speaker 3>you band kathy griffin,</v>

4625
01:57:21.181 --> 01:57:22.710
<v Speaker 3>she's a celebrity with millions of followers.</v>

4626
01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:24.480
<v Speaker 3>They don't care about Alex Jones.</v>

4627
01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:25.710
<v Speaker 3>Alex jones sell supplements.</v>

4628
01:57:25.890 --> 01:57:26.640
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4629
01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:27.271
<v Speaker 3>It's complicated.</v>

4630
01:57:27.271 --> 01:57:27.481
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4631
01:57:27.481 --> 01:57:29.310
<v Speaker 3>I can't really understand why he's.</v>

4632
01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:30.713
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4633
01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:32.700
<v Speaker 3>he's more polarizing,</v>

4634
01:57:32.701 --> 01:57:34.020
<v Speaker 3>but he's also very famous.</v>

4635
01:57:34.050 --> 01:57:34.231
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4636
01:57:34.231 --> 01:57:34.501
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

4637
01:57:34.501 --> 01:57:36.300
<v Speaker 3>kathy griffin showed a photo of Donald Trump with this,</v>

4638
01:57:36.330 --> 01:57:36.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4639
01:57:36.750 --> 01:57:37.650
<v Speaker 3>with his head cut off,</v>

4640
01:57:37.651 --> 01:57:38.090
<v Speaker 3>which is even,</v>

4641
01:57:38.090 --> 01:57:38.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4642
01:57:38.260 --> 01:57:39.630
<v Speaker 3>aren't so unless something really crazy.</v>

4643
01:57:40.110 --> 01:57:43.320
<v Speaker 3>The guy who wrote all the articles demanding,</v>

4644
01:57:43.370 --> 01:57:45.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't to say demand and that's maybe unfair.</v>

4645
01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Oliver darcy goes on cnn and says it was media pressure that got jones' band.</v>

4646
01:57:49.770 --> 01:57:51.120
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy who repeatedly wrote about it.</v>

4647
01:57:51.121 --> 01:57:51.541
<v Speaker 3>He was the guy.</v>

4648
01:57:51.541 --> 01:57:52.590
<v Speaker 3>Jones confronted about it.</v>

4649
01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:53.100
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4650
01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:57.330
<v Speaker 3>Oliver darcy interviewed me in 2016 about a video I made where I said it's.</v>

4651
01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:00.810
<v Speaker 3>It's worrisome that twitter is banning people for their political ideologies.</v>

4652
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:02.550
<v Speaker 3>Oliver darcy inter,</v>

4653
01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:02.800
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

4654
01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:03.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you interviewed me,</v>

4655
01:58:03.811 --> 01:58:07.950
<v Speaker 3>but he wrote an article about my video and this is a journalist at business</v>

4656
01:58:07.951 --> 01:58:08.910
<v Speaker 3>insider who says,</v>

4657
01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:09.031
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4658
01:58:09.031 --> 01:58:09.900
<v Speaker 3>that's a really interesting thing.</v>

4659
01:58:09.901 --> 01:58:10.040
<v Speaker 3>Tim,</v>

4660
01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:11.670
<v Speaker 3>let me write about your take on what's happening.</v>

4661
01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:13.620
<v Speaker 3>And then two years later is,</v>

4662
01:58:13.770 --> 01:58:16.230
<v Speaker 3>is talking about how his media pressure got jones' band.</v>

4663
01:58:16.231 --> 01:58:17.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like a weird one 80,</v>

4664
01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:18.390
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4665
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:19.110
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4666
01:58:19.110 --> 01:58:19.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4667
01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:22.020
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not trying to be disrespectful to him because I,</v>

4668
01:58:22.050 --> 01:58:22.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4669
01:58:22.330 --> 01:58:23.760
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm somewhat in passing,</v>

4670
01:58:23.761 --> 01:58:27.420
<v Speaker 3>but I will say there's a certain point where I think it's unfair to accuse a</v>

4671
01:58:27.421 --> 01:58:29.910
<v Speaker 3>journalist of advocating for something simply for covering it.</v>

4672
01:58:30.570 --> 01:58:34.620
<v Speaker 3>But then he went on cnn And said it was media pressure that got him banned and</v>

4673
01:58:34.621 --> 01:58:35.071
<v Speaker 3>I'm kinda like,</v>

4674
01:58:35.071 --> 01:58:35.281
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

4675
01:58:35.281 --> 01:58:37.890
<v Speaker 3>You have to realize at that point you were the one who led that charge.</v>

4676
01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:38.993
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4677
01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:40.370
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

4678
01:58:40.650 --> 01:58:40.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

4679
01:58:40.990 --> 01:58:42.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if you like them or not.</v>

4680
01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.980
<v Speaker 3>Banningham for for dubious reasons,</v>

4681
01:58:44.981 --> 01:58:46.330
<v Speaker 3>just creates huge problems.</v>

4682
01:58:46.331 --> 01:58:47.410
<v Speaker 3>It shows your bias,</v>

4683
01:58:47.890 --> 01:58:49.300
<v Speaker 3>but just saying it that way too.</v>

4684
01:58:49.301 --> 01:58:50.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like when hunter s thompson,</v>

4685
01:58:51.100 --> 01:58:56.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm spread the rumor about ed muskie being on ibogaine and then he went on the</v>

4686
01:58:56.501 --> 01:58:57.400
<v Speaker 3>dick cavett show.</v>

4687
01:58:57.401 --> 01:58:58.690
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious clip.</v>

4688
01:58:59.050 --> 01:59:00.310
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

4689
01:59:01.210 --> 01:59:02.410
<v Speaker 3>well actually there was a rumor,</v>

4690
01:59:02.530 --> 01:59:04.470
<v Speaker 3>there was a rumor about him being on.</v>

4691
01:59:04.490 --> 01:59:05.320
<v Speaker 3>I began to,</v>

4692
01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:09.030
<v Speaker 3>I know because I started the rumor and you know,</v>

4693
01:59:09.450 --> 01:59:09.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4694
01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:10.391
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly,</v>

4695
01:59:10.391 --> 01:59:11.740
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of the same thing.</v>

4696
01:59:12.190 --> 01:59:13.023
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4697
01:59:13.330 --> 01:59:13.601
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4698
01:59:13.601 --> 01:59:13.801
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

4699
01:59:13.801 --> 01:59:14.634
<v Speaker 3>you caused it.</v>

4700
01:59:15.010 --> 01:59:15.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4701
01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:15.520
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4702
01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:16.060
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4703
01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:17.330
<v Speaker 3>You spread the rumor but that.</v>

4704
01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:20.860
<v Speaker 3>But there's another thing too is I'm patrion band,</v>

4705
01:59:20.861 --> 01:59:21.694
<v Speaker 3>lauren southern,</v>

4706
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:22.900
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like a year and a half,</v>

4707
01:59:22.901 --> 01:59:23.734
<v Speaker 3>two years ago.</v>

4708
01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:26.270
<v Speaker 3>And when she got banned it,</v>

4709
01:59:26.350 --> 01:59:27.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know what happened,</v>

4710
01:59:27.281 --> 01:59:27.680
<v Speaker 3>but she,</v>

4711
01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:29.200
<v Speaker 3>she went in the boat in the mediterranean.</v>

4712
01:59:29.230 --> 01:59:30.160
<v Speaker 3>And what was that?</v>

4713
01:59:30.190 --> 01:59:31.840
<v Speaker 3>She did something with the migrants.</v>

4714
01:59:31.930 --> 01:59:32.260
<v Speaker 3>She did,</v>

4715
01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:33.760
<v Speaker 3>she did a protest action with,</v>

4716
01:59:33.761 --> 01:59:35.320
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was generation identity,</v>

4717
01:59:35.410 --> 01:59:36.131
<v Speaker 3>which are,</v>

4718
01:59:36.131 --> 01:59:36.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4719
01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:38.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to describe them because,</v>

4720
01:59:38.050 --> 01:59:38.291
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4721
01:59:38.291 --> 01:59:39.490
<v Speaker 3>people like to throw labels around,</v>

4722
01:59:39.491 --> 01:59:43.220
<v Speaker 3>but they're like a european nationalists and I,</v>

4723
01:59:43.250 --> 01:59:45.310
<v Speaker 3>I know people have called them white nationalists,</v>

4724
01:59:45.311 --> 01:59:45.581
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

4725
01:59:45.581 --> 01:59:46.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about their group,</v>

4726
01:59:46.711 --> 01:59:47.990
<v Speaker 3>so I think it's fair to say that that's,</v>

4727
01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:49.030
<v Speaker 3>that might be the case.</v>

4728
01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:50.800
<v Speaker 3>Forgive me for being ignorant for the most part,</v>

4729
01:59:50.801 --> 01:59:51.461
<v Speaker 3>but their ideology,</v>

4730
01:59:51.461 --> 01:59:52.600
<v Speaker 3>I know people are going to tear me apart.</v>

4731
01:59:53.170 --> 01:59:54.003
<v Speaker 3>She gets in a boat,</v>

4732
01:59:54.610 --> 01:59:55.760
<v Speaker 3>they go up to one of these.</v>

4733
01:59:55.761 --> 01:59:55.930
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

4734
01:59:55.930 --> 01:59:56.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4735
01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:58.330
<v Speaker 3>one of these migrant vessels that does,</v>

4736
01:59:58.331 --> 01:59:58.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4737
01:59:58.570 --> 01:59:58.770
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

4738
01:59:58.770 --> 01:59:59.010
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

4739
01:59:59.010 --> 02:00:00.580
<v Speaker 3>they say it's a search and rescue vehicle,</v>

4740
02:00:00.581 --> 02:00:00.920
<v Speaker 3>but this,</v>

4741
02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:05.110
<v Speaker 3>that's been a point of a debate and she like waves a flyer in the air and then</v>

4742
02:00:05.111 --> 02:00:05.350
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

4743
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:06.580
<v Speaker 3>she says on the stream,</v>

4744
02:00:06.590 --> 02:00:07.421
<v Speaker 3>like get in front of them,</v>

4745
02:00:07.421 --> 02:00:08.080
<v Speaker 3>get in front of him.</v>

4746
02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:11.620
<v Speaker 3>But I believe she never did jack connie banter and there are like,</v>

4747
02:00:11.621 --> 02:00:13.150
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing may have caused loss of life,</v>

4748
02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:13.993
<v Speaker 3>your band.</v>

4749
02:00:14.290 --> 02:00:17.770
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people then started to point out that there's a website called it's</v>

4750
02:00:17.771 --> 02:00:19.480
<v Speaker 3>going down and this is a,</v>

4751
02:00:19.481 --> 02:00:19.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4752
02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:20.770
<v Speaker 3>consider to be far left.</v>

4753
02:00:20.771 --> 02:00:21.604
<v Speaker 3>Extremists site.</v>

4754
02:00:21.610 --> 02:00:25.750
<v Speaker 3>One of the articles was teaching people or advocating for pouring concrete on</v>

4755
02:00:25.751 --> 02:00:28.330
<v Speaker 3>train tracks to disrupt,</v>

4756
02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:31.090
<v Speaker 3>derail the strains can cause loss of life.</v>

4757
02:00:31.630 --> 02:00:32.110
<v Speaker 3>So jack,</v>

4758
02:00:32.110 --> 02:00:34.630
<v Speaker 3>so I saw this and I thought this is really fascinating.</v>

4759
02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:37.840
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to know why patrion band southern and why they don't take action in</v>

4760
02:00:37.841 --> 02:00:38.674
<v Speaker 3>this regard.</v>

4761
02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:39.720
<v Speaker 3>I reached out to jack conti.</v>

4762
02:00:39.721 --> 02:00:40.201
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted at him,</v>

4763
02:00:40.201 --> 02:00:40.550
<v Speaker 3>he said he'd,</v>

4764
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.751
<v Speaker 3>he'd,</v>

4765
02:00:40.751 --> 02:00:42.520
<v Speaker 3>he'd call me on the phone and I said,</v>

4766
02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:42.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4767
02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:43.670
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to understand your,</v>

4768
02:00:43.671 --> 02:00:43.910
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

4769
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:44.180
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

4770
02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:45.011
<v Speaker 3>your decision making,</v>

4771
02:00:45.011 --> 02:00:45.844
<v Speaker 3>how this came to be,</v>

4772
02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:47.230
<v Speaker 3>what brought you to the attention of lauren,</v>

4773
02:00:47.231 --> 02:00:48.040
<v Speaker 3>what about this?</v>

4774
02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:48.761
<v Speaker 3>He ended up banning,</v>

4775
02:00:48.761 --> 02:00:53.761
<v Speaker 3>iT's going down and then they wrote an article titled tim pool and the alt right</v>

4776
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:54.510
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>

4777
02:00:54.510 --> 02:00:54.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4778
02:00:54.830 --> 02:00:56.560
<v Speaker 3>it's going down band from patron or something.</v>

4779
02:00:56.940 --> 02:00:57.810
<v Speaker 3>And that's been cited.</v>

4780
02:00:57.860 --> 02:01:00.580
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy dore had it on his show and a bunch of other like,</v>

4781
02:01:00.590 --> 02:01:00.980
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

4782
02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:01.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4783
02:01:01.290 --> 02:01:02.140
<v Speaker 3>temple's not outright.</v>

4784
02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:02.921
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

4785
02:01:02.921 --> 02:01:03.754
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>

4786
02:01:04.060 --> 02:01:05.590
<v Speaker 3>I didn't advocate for them to be banned.</v>

4787
02:01:06.190 --> 02:01:07.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't want anyone band,</v>

4788
02:01:07.870 --> 02:01:08.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4789
02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:11.380
<v Speaker 3>I just want to know what their decision making process was and this was the</v>

4790
02:01:11.410 --> 02:01:13.720
<v Speaker 3>thing that was going viral among people on twitter who are or,</v>

4791
02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:14.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4792
02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:14.860
<v Speaker 3>asking about this.</v>

4793
02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:19.580
<v Speaker 3>And so now I get accused of campaigning to get them back just like,</v>

4794
02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:19.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4795
02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:20.830
<v Speaker 3>I live for darcy was with,</v>

4796
02:01:20.831 --> 02:01:21.100
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

4797
02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:21.910
<v Speaker 3>with um,</v>

4798
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:22.743
<v Speaker 3>with jones,</v>

4799
02:01:23.290 --> 02:01:24.510
<v Speaker 3>but a well,</v>

4800
02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:27.850
<v Speaker 3>and then immediately they slapped that distinction on you as soon as.</v>

4801
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:29.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean just calling someone outright to.</v>

4802
02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:31.030
<v Speaker 3>It's so strange how,</v>

4803
02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:31.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4804
02:01:31.721 --> 02:01:32.501
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know,</v>

4805
02:01:32.501 --> 02:01:37.501
<v Speaker 3>but all in the world of standup comedy used to be progressive liberal,</v>

4806
02:01:37.700 --> 02:01:38.380
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4807
02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:40.790
<v Speaker 3>like weird coffee shop type rooms.</v>

4808
02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:42.260
<v Speaker 3>It was all comedy.</v>

4809
02:01:42.410 --> 02:01:45.590
<v Speaker 3>They don't even use that term anymore because it's so toxic.</v>

4810
02:01:45.650 --> 02:01:48.140
<v Speaker 3>And I try to avoid saying I'll use the alternative media all the time.</v>

4811
02:01:48.170 --> 02:01:51.230
<v Speaker 3>And this has happened over the course of just a couple of years.</v>

4812
02:01:51.231 --> 02:01:51.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4813
02:01:51.690 --> 02:01:56.420
<v Speaker 3>the thing is shifted and it's moving and evolving and morphing so quickly.</v>

4814
02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:01.070
<v Speaker 3>You want to know what's really crazy for years on my wikipedia page at claimed</v>

4815
02:02:01.071 --> 02:02:02.240
<v Speaker 3>that I invented a zipline.</v>

4816
02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Zipline like a blimp.</v>

4817
02:02:05.090 --> 02:02:05.923
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4818
02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4819
02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:07.611
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>

4820
02:02:07.611 --> 02:02:07.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4821
02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:08.061
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4822
02:02:08.061 --> 02:02:11.200
<v Speaker 3>wikipedia said I was Brian Collins brother for decades.</v>

4823
02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:11.690
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>

4824
02:02:11.690 --> 02:02:12.523
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>

4825
02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:13.730
<v Speaker 3>When I went to Sweden,</v>

4826
02:02:14.270 --> 02:02:15.470
<v Speaker 3>I specifically stated,</v>

4827
02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:16.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4828
02:02:16.510 --> 02:02:16.751
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>

4829
02:02:16.751 --> 02:02:16.890
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

4830
02:02:16.890 --> 02:02:16.981
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

4831
02:02:16.981 --> 02:02:17.110
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

4832
02:02:17.110 --> 02:02:17.201
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

4833
02:02:17.201 --> 02:02:17.691
<v Speaker 3>let me back up.</v>

4834
02:02:17.691 --> 02:02:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Paul Joseph Watson of info wars put out a call saying,</v>

4835
02:02:20.571 --> 02:02:23.960
<v Speaker 3>I challenge any journalists to spend a weekend in malmo and I'll cover your</v>

4836
02:02:23.961 --> 02:02:24.794
<v Speaker 3>costs.</v>

4837
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's bombarding him saying,</v>

4838
02:02:27.230 --> 02:02:27.471
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4839
02:02:27.471 --> 02:02:27.801
<v Speaker 3>pay me,</v>

4840
02:02:27.801 --> 02:02:28.610
<v Speaker 3>pay me.</v>

4841
02:02:28.610 --> 02:02:29.780
<v Speaker 3>And he's kind of just ignoring it.</v>

4842
02:02:30.050 --> 02:02:31.280
<v Speaker 3>People are threatening to sue him.</v>

4843
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:32.001
<v Speaker 3>You better pay.</v>

4844
02:02:32.001 --> 02:02:32.834
<v Speaker 3>You promised.</v>

4845
02:02:33.180 --> 02:02:36.200
<v Speaker 3>I had already set up a go fund me for the project before,</v>

4846
02:02:36.201 --> 02:02:38.480
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was before he announced I made a video about it saying,</v>

4847
02:02:38.481 --> 02:02:39.131
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump says x,</v>

4848
02:02:39.131 --> 02:02:39.200
<v Speaker 3>y,</v>

4849
02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:39.410
<v Speaker 3>and z.</v>

4850
02:02:39.410 --> 02:02:40.400
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go to the story.</v>

4851
02:02:40.940 --> 02:02:42.080
<v Speaker 3>When I saw he made this call,</v>

4852
02:02:42.081 --> 02:02:43.490
<v Speaker 3>I think it was actually emily who noticed it.</v>

4853
02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:44.930
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

4854
02:02:44.930 --> 02:02:45.141
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4855
02:02:45.141 --> 02:02:45.974
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it.</v>

4856
02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:47.450
<v Speaker 3>And he was like to be.</v>

4857
02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:48.460
<v Speaker 3>I think that's something like,</v>

4858
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:49.281
<v Speaker 3>I was just taking the piss,</v>

4859
02:02:49.281 --> 02:02:49.701
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

4860
02:02:49.701 --> 02:02:49.911
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

4861
02:02:49.911 --> 02:02:50.721
<v Speaker 3>I'll send you a donation,</v>

4862
02:02:50.721 --> 02:02:51.531
<v Speaker 3>and I laughed and I was like,</v>

4863
02:02:51.531 --> 02:02:51.831
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

4864
02:02:51.831 --> 02:02:52.190
<v Speaker 3>I'll take,</v>

4865
02:02:52.190 --> 02:02:52.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4866
02:02:52.311 --> 02:02:53.810
<v Speaker 3>if he wants to throw my at my go fund me.</v>

4867
02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:59.120
<v Speaker 3>Here's what ends up happening as people then claim I was uh,</v>

4868
02:02:59.121 --> 02:03:01.520
<v Speaker 3>I went there because Paul Joseph Watson challenged,</v>

4869
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:02.000
<v Speaker 3>challenged me.</v>

4870
02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:02.833
<v Speaker 3>Not true.</v>

4871
02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:07.400
<v Speaker 3>He donated about nine percent of our total fund that we raised and I was already</v>

4872
02:03:07.401 --> 02:03:08.234
<v Speaker 3>planning on going there.</v>

4873
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:09.343
<v Speaker 3>Wikipedia.</v>

4874
02:03:10.130 --> 02:03:10.430
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4875
02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:13.260
<v Speaker 3>there was a challenge on my wikipedia page where they,</v>

4876
02:03:13.420 --> 02:03:14.360
<v Speaker 3>someone said,</v>

4877
02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:16.730
<v Speaker 3>you wrote tim pool went there because it,</v>

4878
02:03:16.731 --> 02:03:17.780
<v Speaker 3>paul just wasn't challenged him to.</v>

4879
02:03:17.781 --> 02:03:18.614
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>

4880
02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:19.820
<v Speaker 3>What's your proof?</v>

4881
02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.640
<v Speaker 3>This youtube video from tim pool where he sAys,</v>

4882
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:24.080
<v Speaker 3>we've already arranged this.</v>

4883
02:03:24.081 --> 02:03:25.250
<v Speaker 3>We're not going here because of paul.</v>

4884
02:03:25.251 --> 02:03:26.084
<v Speaker 3>Joseph watson.</v>

4885
02:03:26.150 --> 02:03:28.820
<v Speaker 3>The response that's not a reliable source.</v>

4886
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:30.890
<v Speaker 3>Someone came back with a reliable source,</v>

4887
02:03:30.891 --> 02:03:31.121
<v Speaker 3>you know it,</v>

4888
02:03:31.121 --> 02:03:34.550
<v Speaker 3>it was a huffington post article that quoted my youtube video.</v>

4889
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:38.743
<v Speaker 3>How's that?</v>

4890
02:03:39.170 --> 02:03:40.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>

4891
02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Why couldn't you just take my word for it?</v>

4892
02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:44.630
<v Speaker 3>Why did you have to get huffington post to just quote me?</v>

4893
02:03:45.170 --> 02:03:47.050
<v Speaker 3>That was apparently so I,</v>

4894
02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:47.893
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4895
02:03:48.250 --> 02:03:49.041
<v Speaker 3>that's enough.</v>

4896
02:03:49.041 --> 02:03:49.810
<v Speaker 3>I guess so.</v>

4897
02:03:49.810 --> 02:03:53.120
<v Speaker 3>So the reason I bring this up is because what happens then if you're a</v>

4898
02:03:53.121 --> 02:03:57.470
<v Speaker 3>conservative and a bunch of friends who work for various news organizations all</v>

4899
02:03:57.471 --> 02:03:58.041
<v Speaker 3>at the same time,</v>

4900
02:03:58.041 --> 02:04:02.330
<v Speaker 3>write 10 articles saying joe rogan is all right now on wikipedia at 10 articles</v>

4901
02:04:02.331 --> 02:04:03.980
<v Speaker 3>pop up immediately saying this is a fact.</v>

4902
02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:08.090
<v Speaker 3>Ten different organizations have written it and there it is in your and your</v>

4903
02:04:08.091 --> 02:04:08.660
<v Speaker 3>page.</v>

4904
02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:11.180
<v Speaker 3>And the crazy thing is the uk does this all the time,</v>

4905
02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:11.661
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4906
02:04:11.661 --> 02:04:13.160
<v Speaker 3>they call various personalities,</v>

4907
02:04:13.161 --> 02:04:13.641
<v Speaker 3>alt right?</v>

4908
02:04:13.641 --> 02:04:14.330
<v Speaker 3>They call sargon.</v>

4909
02:04:14.330 --> 02:04:15.163
<v Speaker 3>They call it [inaudible].</v>

4910
02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Just go to wikipedia and look up the phrase it means white nationalists,</v>

4911
02:04:18.141 --> 02:04:18.974
<v Speaker 3>neo confederate.</v>

4912
02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:20.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like literally about a white ethno state.</v>

4913
02:04:21.110 --> 02:04:23.360
<v Speaker 3>These people have denounced this and that and you know,</v>

4914
02:04:23.370 --> 02:04:27.740
<v Speaker 3>it's like going to chicago was a really fascinating phenomenon on patrion where</v>

4915
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:33.310
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden these left wing outlets said sargon was banned for a going after</v>

4916
02:04:33.501 --> 02:04:34.334
<v Speaker 3>the alt right.</v>

4917
02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:34.851
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

4918
02:04:34.851 --> 02:04:35.684
<v Speaker 3>well hold on.</v>

4919
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:37.290
<v Speaker 3>You've wriTten in the past that he was.</v>

4920
02:04:37.291 --> 02:04:38.060
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

4921
02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:42.170
<v Speaker 2>Well when you say you like the media is not the organization,</v>

4922
02:04:42.370 --> 02:04:43.530
<v Speaker 2>same organizations,</v>

4923
02:04:43.531 --> 02:04:44.460
<v Speaker 2>but different authors.</v>

4924
02:04:44.490 --> 02:04:44.791
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4925
02:04:44.791 --> 02:04:45.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't wanna I don't want to,</v>

4926
02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:47.670
<v Speaker 2>but not the same journalists.</v>

4927
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4928
02:04:48.590 --> 02:04:48.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4929
02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I will lean towards,</v>

4930
02:04:50.011 --> 02:04:50.521
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

4931
02:04:50.521 --> 02:04:50.911
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4932
02:04:50.911 --> 02:04:51.431
<v Speaker 2>Because it's,</v>

4933
02:04:51.431 --> 02:04:51.750
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4934
02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:52.920
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>

4935
02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:53.970
<v Speaker 2>whenever it's convenient,</v>

4936
02:04:53.971 --> 02:04:54.480
<v Speaker 2>they just throw,</v>

4937
02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:55.170
<v Speaker 2>throw that.</v>

4938
02:04:55.170 --> 02:04:57.000
<v Speaker 2>There are some people who write.</v>

4939
02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:59.130
<v Speaker 2>The problem is if I may,</v>

4940
02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:00.210
<v Speaker 2>if I name these people,</v>

4941
02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:01.050
<v Speaker 2>they're going to,</v>

4942
02:05:01.050 --> 02:05:03.690
<v Speaker 2>they're going to point their pens in my direction and then all of these things</v>

4943
02:05:03.691 --> 02:05:04.471
<v Speaker 2>are going to swing at me.</v>

4944
02:05:04.471 --> 02:05:06.120
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing too is I don't want to do,</v>

4945
02:05:06.121 --> 02:05:06.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to forget them.</v>

4946
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:07.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not important anyway.</v>

4947
02:05:07.950 --> 02:05:11.790
<v Speaker 2>What's really important is the actual reality of how that's done there are,</v>

4948
02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:14.040
<v Speaker 2>I really want to name this organization.</v>

4949
02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:16.110
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the prominent well known,</v>

4950
02:05:16.111 --> 02:05:18.870
<v Speaker 2>but they repeatedly write stories that are just so over the top.</v>

4951
02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:20.250
<v Speaker 2>I roll my eyes and I'm like,</v>

4952
02:05:20.810 --> 02:05:21.600
<v Speaker 2>do you will.</v>

4953
02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:22.740
<v Speaker 2>I will say The huffington post,</v>

4954
02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:23.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4955
02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:24.930
<v Speaker 2>is another organization that wrote</v>

4956
02:05:26.590 --> 02:05:27.423
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4957
02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:28.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4958
02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:28.591
<v Speaker 2>oh god,</v>

4959
02:05:28.591 --> 02:05:29.090
<v Speaker 2>what was it?</v>

4960
02:05:29.090 --> 02:05:29.400
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>

4961
02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:29.720
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

4962
02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:34.720
<v Speaker 2>This guy wrote about nazis on steam steam that steam has a knotty problem and</v>

4963
02:05:35.881 --> 02:05:37.710
<v Speaker 2>very clearly like anybody was like,</v>

4964
02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:39.500
<v Speaker 2>it was a game</v>

4965
02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:44.550
<v Speaker 2>because apparently he was referencing a very small like,</v>

4966
02:05:44.670 --> 02:05:45.480
<v Speaker 2>here's what happens.</v>

4967
02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:45.781
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4968
02:05:45.781 --> 02:05:46.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know too much about this.</v>

4969
02:05:46.951 --> 02:05:49.290
<v Speaker 2>I know there was criticism in the journalism space around what he did,</v>

4970
02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:52.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's like you find three guys on twitter who are saying something.</v>

4971
02:05:52.951 --> 02:05:53.371
<v Speaker 2>They quote,</v>

4972
02:05:53.371 --> 02:05:54.300
<v Speaker 2>tweet them and say boom,</v>

4973
02:05:54.301 --> 02:05:56.400
<v Speaker 2>fact like you find one guy who says,</v>

4974
02:05:56.401 --> 02:05:56.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4975
02:05:56.641 --> 02:05:57.960
<v Speaker 2>I just plain don't like this group.</v>

4976
02:05:57.961 --> 02:05:58.490
<v Speaker 2>And they'll be like,</v>

4977
02:05:58.490 --> 02:05:58.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4978
02:05:58.710 --> 02:05:59.850
<v Speaker 2>nazis don't like this group.</v>

4979
02:05:59.851 --> 02:06:01.680
<v Speaker 2>And they'll write a big story about it because they found one tweet.</v>

4980
02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:02.720
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

4981
02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:03.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4982
02:06:03.300 --> 02:06:04.890
<v Speaker 2>So apparently,</v>

4983
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:06.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4984
02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:08.760
<v Speaker 2>this guy in the huffington post wrote a story about how people on gab,</v>

4985
02:06:08.770 --> 02:06:11.730
<v Speaker 2>we're presenting really discussing recipes for food and I'm just,</v>

4986
02:06:11.731 --> 02:06:16.731
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering what's newsworthy about a random gab users mascioli recipe.</v>

4987
02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:17.371
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4988
02:06:17.371 --> 02:06:18.060
<v Speaker 2>I saw that.</v>

4989
02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:18.811
<v Speaker 2>It was hilarious.</v>

4990
02:06:18.811 --> 02:06:19.051
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4991
02:06:19.051 --> 02:06:19.290
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

4992
02:06:19.290 --> 02:06:20.123
<v Speaker 2>but then again,</v>

4993
02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:21.360
<v Speaker 2>is that comedy article?</v>

4994
02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:22.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4995
02:06:22.051 --> 02:06:23.160
<v Speaker 2>it's an opinion piece.</v>

4996
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:24.780
<v Speaker 2>It's just calling people assholes.</v>

4997
02:06:24.810 --> 02:06:26.880
<v Speaker 2>But then there's senior editor,</v>

4998
02:06:26.881 --> 02:06:29.100
<v Speaker 2>a senior writer who travels and covers news on the ground.</v>

4999
02:06:29.101 --> 02:06:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Why but put.</v>

5000
02:06:30.070 --> 02:06:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

5001
02:06:30.510 --> 02:06:32.820
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that funny or isn't it interesting?</v>

5002
02:06:32.821 --> 02:06:35.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just some shitty recipes.</v>

5003
02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:40.560
<v Speaker 2>like the only thing that's odd about it is that it's a gab shitty recipe because</v>

5004
02:06:40.561 --> 02:06:42.240
<v Speaker 2>it was just a shitty recipe online.</v>

5005
02:06:42.241 --> 02:06:43.074
<v Speaker 2>But that's my question.</v>

5006
02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:44.400
<v Speaker 2>Say it was on medium,</v>

5007
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.841
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>

5008
02:06:45.841 --> 02:06:47.730
<v Speaker 2>we can't leave without talking about Jeff Bezos.</v>

5009
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

5010
02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:49.780
<v Speaker 2>well we can get into that.</v>

5011
02:06:49.790 --> 02:06:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

5012
02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:50.700
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about it.</v>

5013
02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:52.500
<v Speaker 2>But if it was on medium,</v>

5014
02:06:52.501 --> 02:06:53.280
<v Speaker 2>if someone said like,</v>

5015
02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:56.700
<v Speaker 2>look at these dummies with their terrible fucking recipes,</v>

5016
02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:58.440
<v Speaker 2>it would still be almost as interesting,</v>

5017
02:06:58.441 --> 02:07:00.290
<v Speaker 2>but it's flavored by.</v>

5018
02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:02.710
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to mock them because it's your job.</v>

5019
02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:03.170
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

5020
02:07:03.170 --> 02:07:03.481
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

5021
02:07:03.481 --> 02:07:05.250
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like they're uneducated.</v>

5022
02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:05.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5023
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:10.910
<v Speaker 2>vox ran an article claiming that people who hold alt right views are like 11</v>

5024
02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:14.340
<v Speaker 2>million or some huge number and that's just like,</v>

5025
02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:15.293
<v Speaker 2>it's absurd.</v>

5026
02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:17.700
<v Speaker 2>That's not 11 million american.</v>

5027
02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:20.880
<v Speaker 2>What you defined outright as being some sort of a white supremacist.</v>

5028
02:07:20.881 --> 02:07:21.780
<v Speaker 2>I will quote the associated.</v>

5029
02:07:21.781 --> 02:07:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5030
02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:22.793
<v Speaker 2>Associated press.</v>

5031
02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:27.630
<v Speaker 2>The aap guidelines are that alt right means white nationalist,</v>

5032
02:07:27.690 --> 02:07:28.290
<v Speaker 2>a designer.</v>

5033
02:07:28.290 --> 02:07:28.801
<v Speaker 2>Can I ask you this?</v>

5034
02:07:28.801 --> 02:07:29.634
<v Speaker 2>Who defined that?</v>

5035
02:07:30.150 --> 02:07:30.840
<v Speaker 2>How does it,</v>

5036
02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:31.560
<v Speaker 2>why are they.</v>

5037
02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:35.320
<v Speaker 2>Because Richard Spencer is the man who popularized the term.</v>

5038
02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:36.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5039
02:07:36.300 --> 02:07:37.810
<v Speaker 3>So he's not the one who coined it,</v>

5040
02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:40.990
<v Speaker 3>but he popularized it and he is a white nationalist.</v>

5041
02:07:41.090 --> 02:07:41.310
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5042
02:07:41.310 --> 02:07:41.620
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

5043
02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:42.130
<v Speaker 3>I Mean,</v>

5044
02:07:42.130 --> 02:07:42.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5045
02:07:42.370 --> 02:07:43.720
<v Speaker 3>if you want to be a part of his movement,</v>

5046
02:07:43.721 --> 02:07:46.000
<v Speaker 3>there are certain things that are attached to it and uh,</v>

5047
02:07:46.050 --> 02:07:46.421
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

5048
02:07:46.421 --> 02:07:49.150
<v Speaker 3>other people have written huge things about what it is.</v>

5049
02:07:49.690 --> 02:07:51.280
<v Speaker 3>So the ap said,</v>

5050
02:07:51.310 --> 02:07:52.770
<v Speaker 3>these are our guidelines and I'll,</v>

5051
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:53.950
<v Speaker 3>I'll defer to the associated press.</v>

5052
02:07:53.951 --> 02:07:54.910
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of respect for them.</v>

5053
02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:56.350
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

5054
02:07:56.350 --> 02:07:56.591
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5055
02:07:56.591 --> 02:07:57.180
<v Speaker 3>so if,</v>

5056
02:07:57.180 --> 02:07:58.600
<v Speaker 3>if there's a news organizations,</v>

5057
02:07:59.290 --> 02:08:00.850
<v Speaker 3>there was a willamette weekly,</v>

5058
02:08:01.050 --> 02:08:02.770
<v Speaker 3>this is god man.</v>

5059
02:08:02.771 --> 02:08:03.604
<v Speaker 3>I just really,</v>

5060
02:08:03.610 --> 02:08:03.881
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

5061
02:08:03.881 --> 02:08:04.610
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

5062
02:08:04.610 --> 02:08:05.590
<v Speaker 3>I worked for vice,</v>

5063
02:08:05.710 --> 02:08:07.510
<v Speaker 3>I was actually a one.</v>

5064
02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:11.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the key reasons vice news exists and I look back on it now.</v>

5065
02:08:11.710 --> 02:08:13.780
<v Speaker 3>It makes me kind of sad how they've written some of these,</v>

5066
02:08:13.781 --> 02:08:15.130
<v Speaker 3>most of these ridiculous articles.</v>

5067
02:08:15.131 --> 02:08:16.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm really proud of a lot of stuff they've done,</v>

5068
02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:17.041
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

5069
02:08:17.041 --> 02:08:17.860
<v Speaker 3>I quit.</v>

5070
02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:22.630
<v Speaker 3>I quiT when I got an offer from fusion and fusion is an abc,</v>

5071
02:08:22.631 --> 02:08:23.770
<v Speaker 3>univision joint venture.</v>

5072
02:08:24.850 --> 02:08:25.180
<v Speaker 3>When I,</v>

5073
02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:25.991
<v Speaker 3>when I started there,</v>

5074
02:08:25.991 --> 02:08:28.420
<v Speaker 3>they said we won't be partisan for some reason.</v>

5075
02:08:28.421 --> 02:08:31.390
<v Speaker 3>They decided to go far left and start pushing a lot of things that I thought</v>

5076
02:08:31.391 --> 02:08:32.224
<v Speaker 3>were wrong.</v>

5077
02:08:32.290 --> 02:08:32.771
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

5078
02:08:32.771 --> 02:08:33.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5079
02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:36.490
<v Speaker 3>told me to in effect lie right.</v>

5080
02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:37.860
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

5081
02:08:37.861 --> 02:08:41.500
<v Speaker 3>the thing I'll bring up is I just have such disdain for these,</v>

5082
02:08:41.501 --> 02:08:46.501
<v Speaker 3>these news organizations and how they use definitions that suit their needs to</v>

5083
02:08:47.111 --> 02:08:49.000
<v Speaker 3>get the clicks they want your ultra right today.</v>

5084
02:08:49.001 --> 02:08:49.520
<v Speaker 3>You're not outright.</v>

5085
02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:50.680
<v Speaker 3>Tomorrow's fine,</v>

5086
02:08:51.090 --> 02:08:51.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5087
02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:52.060
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

5088
02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:52.241
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5089
02:08:52.241 --> 02:08:54.240
<v Speaker 1>the click thing isn't an issue,</v>

5090
02:08:54.300 --> 02:08:54.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5091
02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5092
02:08:55.380 --> 02:08:58.650
<v Speaker 1>how much of an issue is that journalists are essentially fighting for their</v>

5093
02:08:58.651 --> 02:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>lives because newspaper is almost dead.</v>

5094
02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:03.451
<v Speaker 1>It's online.</v>

5095
02:09:03.451 --> 02:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Publications are trying.</v>

5096
02:09:04.980 --> 02:09:06.420
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to get subscriptions.</v>

5097
02:09:06.421 --> 02:09:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Like I subscribe to several different news online publication that used to be</v>

5098
02:09:10.441 --> 02:09:11.071
<v Speaker 1>newspapers,</v>

5099
02:09:11.071 --> 02:09:14.070
<v Speaker 1>but the last time I picked up an actual newspaper,</v>

5100
02:09:14.730 --> 02:09:19.730
<v Speaker 1>it's so much so that I felt like I had a joke about reading something in the</v>

5101
02:09:20.191 --> 02:09:21.750
<v Speaker 1>paper and uh,</v>

5102
02:09:21.810 --> 02:09:22.890
<v Speaker 1>like turning the pages.</v>

5103
02:09:22.891 --> 02:09:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I almost felt like I'm a liar for doing a joke about turning the page of a</v>

5104
02:09:27.211 --> 02:09:27.631
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>

5105
02:09:27.631 --> 02:09:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5106
02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:29.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the last time I fucking did that.</v>

5107
02:09:29.970 --> 02:09:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Everything I've read is either on a tablet or on a laptop or</v>

5108
02:09:34.330 --> 02:09:34.600
<v Speaker 3>do you know,</v>

5109
02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:36.760
<v Speaker 3>do you know what the galman amnesia effect is?</v>

5110
02:09:36.820 --> 02:09:37.653
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

5111
02:09:38.590 --> 02:09:40.210
<v Speaker 3>When you're an expert in mma,</v>

5112
02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:41.890
<v Speaker 3>you're like one of the foremoSt experts.</v>

5113
02:09:42.310 --> 02:09:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever read a news article about mma that was so wrong?</v>

5114
02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:46.121
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

5115
02:09:46.121 --> 02:09:47.620
<v Speaker 3>so that same newspaper,</v>

5116
02:09:47.621 --> 02:09:48.454
<v Speaker 3>you're reading it,</v>

5117
02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:50.860
<v Speaker 3>you see that store and you laugh how ron it could be you turn the page and</v>

5118
02:09:50.861 --> 02:09:51.870
<v Speaker 3>there's a story about Syria and you go,</v>

5119
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:52.743
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>

5120
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:55.900
<v Speaker 3>Why would you forget how wrong they were?</v>

5121
02:09:55.901 --> 02:09:59.260
<v Speaker 3>But the reason I bring this up is the analogy is that you turn the page.</v>

5122
02:09:59.520 --> 02:09:59.930
<v Speaker 3>Nobody does.</v>

5123
02:09:59.930 --> 02:10:00.730
<v Speaker 3>You click the link.</v>

5124
02:10:00.730 --> 02:10:00.980
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

5125
02:10:00.980 --> 02:10:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5126
02:10:01.220 --> 02:10:01.481
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

5127
02:10:01.481 --> 02:10:01.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5128
02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:02.740
<v Speaker 3>but let's talk about clicks.</v>

5129
02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:05.290
<v Speaker 3>One of the things we talked about the other day is traffic assignment.</v>

5130
02:10:05.830 --> 02:10:07.510
<v Speaker 3>So I know you asked me this.</v>

5131
02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:08.290
<v Speaker 3>They're fighting for their lives.</v>

5132
02:10:08.290 --> 02:10:09.041
<v Speaker 3>It's a serious issue,</v>

5133
02:10:09.041 --> 02:10:12.670
<v Speaker 3>but I just like to point out their lives never existed in the media space.</v>

5134
02:10:12.671 --> 02:10:12.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5135
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:17.450
<v Speaker 1>please explain that because that was one of the most illuminating aspects of our</v>

5136
02:10:17.451 --> 02:10:18.440
<v Speaker 1>conversation on the phone.</v>

5137
02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:19.091
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5138
02:10:19.091 --> 02:10:19.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5139
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:20.020
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

5140
02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:22.720
<v Speaker 3>it's publicly known but not talked about a whole lot that these media</v>

5141
02:10:22.721 --> 02:10:23.381
<v Speaker 3>organizations,</v>

5142
02:10:23.381 --> 02:10:27.430
<v Speaker 3>mostly these digital new startups don't actually get a lot of views.</v>

5143
02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:30.370
<v Speaker 3>So what they do is it's called a traffic assignment.</v>

5144
02:10:30.930 --> 02:10:34.850
<v Speaker 3>There's a company called comscore that tracks the viewership.</v>

5145
02:10:34.851 --> 02:10:36.050
<v Speaker 3>The unique views these sites have.</v>

5146
02:10:36.530 --> 02:10:40.160
<v Speaker 3>If you're trying to attract investment and you say we get 20 million views per</v>

5147
02:10:40.161 --> 02:10:40.550
<v Speaker 3>month,</v>

5148
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:41.383
<v Speaker 3>they're going to say,</v>

5149
02:10:41.450 --> 02:10:42.171
<v Speaker 3>that's cool,</v>

5150
02:10:42.171 --> 02:10:43.340
<v Speaker 3>but this site get 60.</v>

5151
02:10:43.550 --> 02:10:44.383
<v Speaker 3>What do they do?</v>

5152
02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:44.751
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5153
02:10:44.751 --> 02:10:45.710
<v Speaker 3>there are some sites.</v>

5154
02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:47.000
<v Speaker 3>This is according to variety.</v>

5155
02:10:47.150 --> 02:10:48.620
<v Speaker 3>Modern farmer.com.</v>

5156
02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:49.930
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

5157
02:10:49.930 --> 02:10:50.200
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

5158
02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:50.751
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

5159
02:10:50.751 --> 02:10:51.584
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard of it,</v>

5160
02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:55.250
<v Speaker 3>but there are many sites which you've probably seen where it's like the top 25</v>

5161
02:10:55.251 --> 02:10:56.680
<v Speaker 3>celebrities who you know,</v>

5162
02:10:56.810 --> 02:10:57.620
<v Speaker 3>mess up their makeup.</v>

5163
02:10:57.620 --> 02:10:58.190
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5164
02:10:58.190 --> 02:11:01.220
<v Speaker 3>You click the page and I'll show you a photo in order to see the next photo.</v>

5165
02:11:01.250 --> 02:11:02.810
<v Speaker 3>You got to click the next page.</v>

5166
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:03.830
<v Speaker 3>That's that way.</v>

5167
02:11:03.831 --> 02:11:08.420
<v Speaker 3>They turn you one person to 25 unique views are 25 years.</v>

5168
02:11:08.421 --> 02:11:09.254
<v Speaker 3>I don't wanna say unique.</v>

5169
02:11:09.710 --> 02:11:12.590
<v Speaker 3>Then accompany like vice for instance,</v>

5170
02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:17.030
<v Speaker 3>we'll buy the assignment of your traffic and attribute it to themselves.</v>

5171
02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:21.260
<v Speaker 3>So when the comscore numbers come out it will say all of those views from those</v>

5172
02:11:21.261 --> 02:11:22.670
<v Speaker 3>clickbaits sites are actually vice.</v>

5173
02:11:23.090 --> 02:11:23.450
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5174
02:11:23.450 --> 02:11:24.500
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking crazy.</v>

5175
02:11:24.530 --> 02:11:26.540
<v Speaker 3>And so there was a controversy a bit.</v>

5176
02:11:27.620 --> 02:11:28.101
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

5177
02:11:28.101 --> 02:11:29.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm quoting variety here.</v>

5178
02:11:29.271 --> 02:11:29.961
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get sued,</v>

5179
02:11:29.961 --> 02:11:34.961
<v Speaker 3>but variety said that their traffic went down 17 percent because someone they</v>

5180
02:11:35.031 --> 02:11:38.970
<v Speaker 3>were buying traffic assignment from was like going through turmoil and shake and</v>

5181
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.411
<v Speaker 3>being shaken,</v>

5182
02:11:39.411 --> 02:11:43.820
<v Speaker 3>shaken up and another one of their traffic assignment partners switched to I</v>

5183
02:11:43.821 --> 02:11:44.200
<v Speaker 3>think like,</v>

5184
02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:44.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5185
02:11:44.570 --> 02:11:45.860
<v Speaker 3>got sold to nbc or something.</v>

5186
02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:46.761
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

5187
02:11:46.761 --> 02:11:47.600
<v Speaker 3>So what ends up happening?</v>

5188
02:11:47.930 --> 02:11:48.201
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5189
02:11:48.201 --> 02:11:50.150
<v Speaker 3>I can say I'm a little bit.</v>

5190
02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:54.170
<v Speaker 3>There was a company that was a prominent digital news outlet.</v>

5191
02:11:54.530 --> 02:11:59.530
<v Speaker 3>I knew someone there who was a decently high up who told me our company is</v>

5192
02:12:00.081 --> 02:12:03.350
<v Speaker 3>contemplating whether or not we should engage in traffic assignments to inflate</v>

5193
02:12:03.351 --> 02:12:04.184
<v Speaker 3>our numbers.</v>

5194
02:12:04.490 --> 02:12:05.001
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

5195
02:12:05.001 --> 02:12:05.960
<v Speaker 3>don't do it like,</v>

5196
02:12:05.961 --> 02:12:06.794
<v Speaker 3>that's wrong.</v>

5197
02:12:06.810 --> 02:12:07.311
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

5198
02:12:07.311 --> 02:12:08.240
<v Speaker 3>but we need investment.</v>

5199
02:12:09.860 --> 02:12:12.170
<v Speaker 3>So I wonder if is that fraud?</v>

5200
02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:13.190
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

5201
02:12:13.190 --> 02:12:16.500
<v Speaker 3>But if comscore is,</v>

5202
02:12:16.570 --> 02:12:19.850
<v Speaker 3>is just lumping the numbers together and I go to you and say,</v>

5203
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:21.230
<v Speaker 3>according to comscore,</v>

5204
02:12:21.290 --> 02:12:23.600
<v Speaker 3>our network brings in 60 million.</v>

5205
02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:24.553
<v Speaker 3>I didn't lie.</v>

5206
02:12:24.650 --> 02:12:25.483
<v Speaker 3>That's all true.</v>

5207
02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:26.630
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

5208
02:12:26.630 --> 02:12:27.410
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

5209
02:12:27.410 --> 02:12:28.250
<v Speaker 3>So here's what happens.</v>

5210
02:12:28.490 --> 02:12:30.020
<v Speaker 3>These companies get massive investment.</v>

5211
02:12:30.530 --> 02:12:32.750
<v Speaker 3>They don't actually generate enough clicks or enough money.</v>

5212
02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:35.360
<v Speaker 3>Then once the investment runs out,</v>

5213
02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:37.220
<v Speaker 3>those jobs never existed.</v>

5214
02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:37.911
<v Speaker 3>Those were,</v>

5215
02:12:37.911 --> 02:12:39.620
<v Speaker 3>those were padded by investors.</v>

5216
02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:41.390
<v Speaker 3>So god,</v>

5217
02:12:41.391 --> 02:12:42.224
<v Speaker 3>that's squirrely.</v>

5218
02:12:42.590 --> 02:12:43.311
<v Speaker 3>Everything collapses.</v>

5219
02:12:43.311 --> 02:12:44.270
<v Speaker 3>It seems like fraud.</v>

5220
02:12:44.540 --> 02:12:44.751
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5221
02:12:44.751 --> 02:12:45.200
<v Speaker 3>it does to me.</v>

5222
02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:45.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5223
02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:47.540
<v Speaker 3>That seems like if that was,</v>

5224
02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:48.910
<v Speaker 3>if you were doing that with,</v>

5225
02:12:48.911 --> 02:12:49.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5226
02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:51.260
<v Speaker 3>some tech stock.</v>

5227
02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:52.900
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

5228
02:12:52.900 --> 02:12:53.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5229
02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:53.890
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

5230
02:12:53.890 --> 02:12:54.723
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

5231
02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Musically or something like that,</v>

5232
02:12:57.230 --> 02:12:57.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5233
02:12:57.840 --> 02:12:58.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5234
02:12:58.030 --> 02:13:01.850
<v Speaker 3>I was told by another individual who was at one of these digital companies that</v>

5235
02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:06.680
<v Speaker 3>he felt like what we were seeing was akin to the securities a problem,</v>

5236
02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.590
<v Speaker 3>the mortgage back securities from designate that,</v>

5237
02:13:10.690 --> 02:13:11.810
<v Speaker 3>if that's a better analogy.</v>

5238
02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:12.170
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

5239
02:13:12.170 --> 02:13:12.651
<v Speaker 3>That's what he said.</v>

5240
02:13:12.651 --> 02:13:13.270
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

5241
02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:14.103
<v Speaker 3>think about this.</v>

5242
02:13:14.210 --> 02:13:15.510
<v Speaker 3>You've had all of these big companies,</v>

5243
02:13:15.511 --> 02:13:16.101
<v Speaker 3>these big investment,</v>

5244
02:13:16.101 --> 02:13:17.090
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of millions of dollars,</v>

5245
02:13:17.091 --> 02:13:20.150
<v Speaker 3>$200,000,000 invested into these digital media outlets because they're seeing</v>

5246
02:13:20.151 --> 02:13:20.984
<v Speaker 3>these numbers,</v>

5247
02:13:21.230 --> 02:13:24.200
<v Speaker 3>but underneath there's nothing there and it's crazy.</v>

5248
02:13:24.201 --> 02:13:25.430
<v Speaker 3>So if you're investing money,</v>

5249
02:13:25.431 --> 02:13:26.270
<v Speaker 3>so if you've got some,</v>

5250
02:13:26.300 --> 02:13:27.133
<v Speaker 3>some cash,</v>

5251
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:30.740
<v Speaker 3>you've worked your ass off and you've generated a lot of money and you're like,</v>

5252
02:13:30.741 --> 02:13:30.921
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

5253
02:13:30.921 --> 02:13:32.340
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get into the digital space.</v>

5254
02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:36.210
<v Speaker 3>We have a website that has 90 million clicks and we're going to take that,</v>

5255
02:13:36.211 --> 02:13:38.910
<v Speaker 3>and then you find out you just got fucking host.</v>

5256
02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:40.020
<v Speaker 3>How has that not fraud?</v>

5257
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:42.570
<v Speaker 3>Because buyer beware.</v>

5258
02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:43.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5259
02:13:43.410 --> 02:13:46.080
<v Speaker 3>because there's laws that legalized fraud.</v>

5260
02:13:46.290 --> 02:13:46.740
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

5261
02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:47.460
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>

5262
02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:47.681
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5263
02:13:47.681 --> 02:13:48.480
<v Speaker 3>I use a lot.</v>

5264
02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:49.313
<v Speaker 3>Is it a law?</v>

5265
02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:50.680
<v Speaker 3>But it's.</v>

5266
02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:51.090
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

5267
02:13:51.090 --> 02:13:51.390
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

5268
02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:52.141
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting loophole.</v>

5269
02:13:52.141 --> 02:13:54.390
<v Speaker 3>It's not fraud because they didn't lie to you,</v>

5270
02:13:54.570 --> 02:13:55.403
<v Speaker 3>they didn't deceive you.</v>

5271
02:13:55.650 --> 02:13:58.020
<v Speaker 3>You had every opportunity to look at those numbers and see where they came from,</v>

5272
02:13:58.021 --> 02:13:59.220
<v Speaker 3>to understand what their network was.</v>

5273
02:13:59.250 --> 02:13:59.521
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

5274
02:13:59.521 --> 02:14:01.380
<v Speaker 3>well that may be the case,</v>

5275
02:14:01.381 --> 02:14:03.000
<v Speaker 3>but the act of doing it,</v>

5276
02:14:03.090 --> 02:14:05.100
<v Speaker 3>the act of the fact that you can do it and it really,</v>

5277
02:14:05.101 --> 02:14:05.934
<v Speaker 3>you're getting monitoring.</v>

5278
02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:08.430
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy shady,</v>

5279
02:14:08.610 --> 02:14:09.031
<v Speaker 3>but I'll tell you,</v>

5280
02:14:09.031 --> 02:14:09.570
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what,</v>

5281
02:14:09.570 --> 02:14:10.231
<v Speaker 3>I'll something else too,</v>

5282
02:14:10.231 --> 02:14:10.421
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

5283
02:14:10.421 --> 02:14:12.250
<v Speaker 3>and I say this with the utmost respect for,</v>

5284
02:14:12.251 --> 02:14:13.590
<v Speaker 3>for shane smith who,</v>

5285
02:14:13.591 --> 02:14:14.424
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5286
02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:15.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5287
02:14:15.001 --> 02:14:15.834
<v Speaker 3>I worked at vice,</v>

5288
02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:16.650
<v Speaker 3>we've gone out for drinks.</v>

5289
02:14:16.650 --> 02:14:17.400
<v Speaker 3>They flew me.</v>

5290
02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:18.090
<v Speaker 3>I love shane.</v>

5291
02:14:18.090 --> 02:14:18.923
<v Speaker 3>He's cool dude,</v>

5292
02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:19.913
<v Speaker 3>but he's brilliant.</v>

5293
02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:20.671
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely brilliant.</v>

5294
02:14:20.671 --> 02:14:20.910
<v Speaker 3>He is,</v>

5295
02:14:20.910 --> 02:14:22.750
<v Speaker 3>he is a master of a,</v>

5296
02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:25.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you would call it,</v>

5297
02:14:25.291 --> 02:14:26.124
<v Speaker 3>but it's a form,</v>

5298
02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:26.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5299
02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:26.781
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

5300
02:14:26.781 --> 02:14:29.430
<v Speaker 3>I grew up with a bunch of hacker buddies and in a small little hacker community</v>

5301
02:14:29.431 --> 02:14:33.800
<v Speaker 3>and social engineering is something that I've been relatively well versed in and</v>

5302
02:14:33.810 --> 02:14:34.643
<v Speaker 3>shane,</v>

5303
02:14:34.650 --> 02:14:37.920
<v Speaker 3>whether he knows it or not really really understands how people think and how to</v>

5304
02:14:37.921 --> 02:14:39.060
<v Speaker 3>get them to do things.</v>

5305
02:14:39.570 --> 02:14:40.420
<v Speaker 3>So I'll give you a,</v>

5306
02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:42.210
<v Speaker 3>a fascinating example.</v>

5307
02:14:42.630 --> 02:14:45.450
<v Speaker 3>I left a vice in 2014 and after I left,</v>

5308
02:14:45.451 --> 02:14:48.420
<v Speaker 3>some of the people I had had brought on through recommendation were still there.</v>

5309
02:14:48.810 --> 02:14:49.950
<v Speaker 3>This buddy of mine says,</v>

5310
02:14:50.910 --> 02:14:51.450
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

5311
02:14:51.450 --> 02:14:52.140
<v Speaker 3>good news.</v>

5312
02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:53.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be running the,</v>

5313
02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:57.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be helping produce the news program for the cable channel.</v>

5314
02:14:58.110 --> 02:14:58.501
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

5315
02:14:58.501 --> 02:14:58.621
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

5316
02:14:58.621 --> 02:14:59.281
<v Speaker 3>congratulations.</v>

5317
02:14:59.281 --> 02:15:00.690
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean you're moving to toronto?</v>

5318
02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:01.651
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

5319
02:15:01.651 --> 02:15:05.070
<v Speaker 3>why would I move to toronto and I was like to work on the cable channel.</v>

5320
02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:06.330
<v Speaker 3>This is back in 2014.</v>

5321
02:15:06.331 --> 02:15:07.164
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

5322
02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:09.240
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about we're getting a cable channel.</v>

5323
02:15:09.241 --> 02:15:10.051
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to work on the new show,</v>

5324
02:15:10.051 --> 02:15:10.411
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

5325
02:15:10.411 --> 02:15:10.890
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

5326
02:15:10.890 --> 02:15:12.090
<v Speaker 3>it was a rogers deal.</v>

5327
02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:13.770
<v Speaker 3>The cable channels in Canada.</v>

5328
02:15:14.250 --> 02:15:15.160
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a couple years later,</v>

5329
02:15:15.161 --> 02:15:16.320
<v Speaker 3>so they got the us based channel,</v>

5330
02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:21.030
<v Speaker 3>but what happened was a bunch of my friends who worked at vice didn't know the</v>

5331
02:15:21.031 --> 02:15:22.650
<v Speaker 3>cable channel they got was based in Canada,</v>

5332
02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:27.060
<v Speaker 3>but they believed they were going to be working on a cable channel in the us.</v>

5333
02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:30.960
<v Speaker 3>that's important because you need people to really want to work there and be</v>

5334
02:15:30.961 --> 02:15:34.860
<v Speaker 3>passionate and shane was a master of giving you just enough information so that</v>

5335
02:15:34.861 --> 02:15:38.370
<v Speaker 3>you believed in what you were doing without realizing it's actually not that</v>

5336
02:15:38.371 --> 02:15:39.340
<v Speaker 3>great and I've got.</v>

5337
02:15:39.341 --> 02:15:40.021
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to be dick.</v>

5338
02:15:40.021 --> 02:15:40.950
<v Speaker 3>I think shane's fantastic.</v>

5339
02:15:40.951 --> 02:15:41.761
<v Speaker 3>I don't blame him for this,</v>

5340
02:15:41.761 --> 02:15:42.594
<v Speaker 3>but it's clever.</v>

5341
02:15:42.930 --> 02:15:45.750
<v Speaker 3>You get a bunch of employees who believe they are going to be on this big new</v>

5342
02:15:45.751 --> 02:15:46.770
<v Speaker 3>american cable channel.</v>

5343
02:15:47.070 --> 02:15:47.191
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5344
02:15:47.191 --> 02:15:48.270
<v Speaker 3>shane never said american.</v>

5345
02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:49.170
<v Speaker 3>He just said cable channel.</v>

5346
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:51.900
<v Speaker 3>It's your fault for assuming it was going to be in America,</v>

5347
02:15:52.380 --> 02:15:53.940
<v Speaker 3>but that meant a lot to those employees.</v>

5348
02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.410
<v Speaker 3>So you're able to boost the morale,</v>

5349
02:15:55.411 --> 02:15:58.680
<v Speaker 3>get everybody really excited until they find out it was in Canada.</v>

5350
02:15:59.010 --> 02:15:59.843
<v Speaker 3>And then they were like,</v>

5351
02:15:59.850 --> 02:16:00.151
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

5352
02:16:00.151 --> 02:16:00.810
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

5353
02:16:00.810 --> 02:16:00.961
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

5354
02:16:00.961 --> 02:16:02.670
<v Speaker 3>Eventually they did get their us channel,</v>

5355
02:16:02.671 --> 02:16:03.720
<v Speaker 3>but that's shane's.</v>

5356
02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:04.430
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5357
02:16:04.430 --> 02:16:05.131
<v Speaker 3>he's brilliant.</v>

5358
02:16:05.131 --> 02:16:05.461
<v Speaker 3>He really is.</v>

5359
02:16:05.461 --> 02:16:05.670
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>

5360
02:16:05.670 --> 02:16:06.503
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

5361
02:16:06.510 --> 02:16:07.470
<v Speaker 3>you ever play civilization?</v>

5362
02:16:07.471 --> 02:16:08.220
<v Speaker 3>The video game?</v>

5363
02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:08.850
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5364
02:16:08.850 --> 02:16:09.391
<v Speaker 3>it's fantastic.</v>

5365
02:16:09.391 --> 02:16:10.020
<v Speaker 3>I love this game.</v>

5366
02:16:10.020 --> 02:16:13.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm playing civ six right now and you can get.</v>

5367
02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:14.550
<v Speaker 3>They're called great people.</v>

5368
02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:15.713
<v Speaker 3>They're called great people,</v>

5369
02:16:16.210 --> 02:16:16.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5370
02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:17.580
<v Speaker 3>that if you earn enough points,</v>

5371
02:16:17.581 --> 02:16:18.090
<v Speaker 3>you'll get,</v>

5372
02:16:18.090 --> 02:16:19.260
<v Speaker 3>you'll get like galileo,</v>

5373
02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:20.700
<v Speaker 3>he'll appear in your civilization museum.</v>

5374
02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:23.310
<v Speaker 3>I firmly believe that in 100 years,</v>

5375
02:16:23.311 --> 02:16:24.660
<v Speaker 3>the next civilization 50,</v>

5376
02:16:24.690 --> 02:16:26.760
<v Speaker 3>you'll be able to earn a great merchant,</v>

5377
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:28.870
<v Speaker 3>shane smith because of how I.</v>

5378
02:16:28.970 --> 02:16:31.330
<v Speaker 3>I know he was able to build this empire.</v>

5379
02:16:31.331 --> 02:16:34.600
<v Speaker 3>He did it through very clever ways of getting investment.</v>

5380
02:16:34.601 --> 02:16:37.420
<v Speaker 3>And admittedly I really liked the stuff they used to do back in the day.</v>

5381
02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:38.673
<v Speaker 3>I think the guys,</v>

5382
02:16:38.770 --> 02:16:39.290
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

5383
02:16:39.290 --> 02:16:39.471
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

5384
02:16:39.471 --> 02:16:43.090
<v Speaker 3>he knows how to do it and the reason I bring him up is because the big story</v>

5385
02:16:43.091 --> 02:16:47.230
<v Speaker 3>about traffic assignment was vice losing like 17 percent because of that</v>

5386
02:16:47.231 --> 02:16:48.100
<v Speaker 3>practice they were doing.</v>

5387
02:16:48.130 --> 02:16:51.160
<v Speaker 3>So he really knew how to do the smoke and mirrors.</v>

5388
02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:52.530
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

5389
02:16:52.660 --> 02:16:53.560
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the other,</v>

5390
02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:54.880
<v Speaker 3>when you look at how it pays out,</v>

5391
02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:56.800
<v Speaker 3>pans out to all the other news outlets,</v>

5392
02:16:57.460 --> 02:16:58.600
<v Speaker 3>then having gets laid off,</v>

5393
02:16:58.930 --> 02:16:59.763
<v Speaker 3>you have to one,</v>

5394
02:16:59.830 --> 02:17:03.430
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to wonder why a thousand jobs just got lost in the past week.</v>

5395
02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:05.350
<v Speaker 3>It was just investment money.</v>

5396
02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:07.090
<v Speaker 3>And once they reached their threshold,</v>

5397
02:17:07.510 --> 02:17:08.890
<v Speaker 3>it all came crashing down.</v>

5398
02:17:09.090 --> 02:17:09.560
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

5399
02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:09.810
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

5400
02:17:09.810 --> 02:17:12.160
<v Speaker 3>the modern farmer example,</v>

5401
02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:13.720
<v Speaker 3>like modern farmer,</v>

5402
02:17:13.721 --> 02:17:14.500
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

5403
02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:15.850
<v Speaker 3>I think with just the clicks,</v>

5404
02:17:15.851 --> 02:17:16.560
<v Speaker 3>just the,</v>

5405
02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:16.750
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

5406
02:17:16.750 --> 02:17:21.750
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you can actually buy those clicks anD attribute them to something</v>

5407
02:17:22.091 --> 02:17:22.924
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

5408
02:17:23.350 --> 02:17:25.220
<v Speaker 3>And then you can tell people in the oil will come in.</v>

5409
02:17:25.230 --> 02:17:25.990
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

5410
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:26.820
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5411
02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:27.820
<v Speaker 3>I'll do that.</v>

5412
02:17:27.821 --> 02:17:30.130
<v Speaker 3>And send them over to joe rogan.com.</v>

5413
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.271
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>

5414
02:17:30.271 --> 02:17:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

5415
02:17:30.610 --> 02:17:33.010
<v Speaker 3>and as those other really clever things to like,</v>

5416
02:17:33.011 --> 02:17:33.844
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5417
02:17:33.850 --> 02:17:35.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't think this one is on par,</v>

5418
02:17:35.591 --> 02:17:38.710
<v Speaker 3>but make you have one youtube channel with a thousand subs,</v>

5419
02:17:38.830 --> 02:17:39.551
<v Speaker 3>make 10 more,</v>

5420
02:17:39.551 --> 02:17:40.660
<v Speaker 3>ask all your subs and subscribe.</v>

5421
02:17:40.690 --> 02:17:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Now you've got 10,000 subs,</v>

5422
02:17:42.730 --> 02:17:43.563
<v Speaker 3>get it wrong.</v>

5423
02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:46.540
<v Speaker 3>Same thousand people 10 times and you've got,</v>

5424
02:17:46.780 --> 02:17:49.510
<v Speaker 3>you go around telling people I've got 10,000 subscribers when in reality it's</v>

5425
02:17:49.511 --> 02:17:50.980
<v Speaker 3>just a thousand people on 10 channels.</v>

5426
02:17:52.470 --> 02:17:55.120
<v Speaker 3>So it was really clever ways to inflate your numbers and this attraCts</v>

5427
02:17:55.121 --> 02:17:55.954
<v Speaker 3>investment.</v>

5428
02:17:56.190 --> 02:17:56.440
<v Speaker 3>It'll,</v>

5429
02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:56.891
<v Speaker 3>it also,</v>

5430
02:17:56.891 --> 02:17:57.581
<v Speaker 3>but more importantly,</v>

5431
02:17:57.581 --> 02:18:00.760
<v Speaker 3>it allows leverage in dealing with ads with ad buyers and ad networks.</v>

5432
02:18:00.820 --> 02:18:04.300
<v Speaker 3>What are people doing when they're boosting up their instagram numbers?</v>

5433
02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:05.021
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5434
02:18:05.021 --> 02:18:06.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know a lot about instagram.</v>

5435
02:18:06.650 --> 02:18:07.151
<v Speaker 3>Kind of pull it up.</v>

5436
02:18:07.151 --> 02:18:09.780
<v Speaker 3>I can't show you her and I just went to a website by youtube.</v>

5437
02:18:09.781 --> 02:18:12.190
<v Speaker 3>Use.com for $2,800.</v>

5438
02:18:12.191 --> 02:18:14.820
<v Speaker 3>You can have a million views and that's,</v>

5439
02:18:14.900 --> 02:18:15.420
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>

5440
02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:15.720
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

5441
02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:16.030
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

5442
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:16.331
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

5443
02:18:16.331 --> 02:18:17.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5444
02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:17.740
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

5445
02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:19.030
<v Speaker 3>there's good reasons to do it.</v>

5446
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:20.470
<v Speaker 3>Not if you want to be a youtuber,</v>

5447
02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:22.180
<v Speaker 3>if you want to be successful on youtube,</v>

5448
02:18:22.181 --> 02:18:23.860
<v Speaker 3>buying views ensures you will never make it,</v>

5449
02:18:24.580 --> 02:18:25.900
<v Speaker 3>but look at it this way.</v>

5450
02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:28.480
<v Speaker 3>No one do this.</v>

5451
02:18:29.110 --> 02:18:29.590
<v Speaker 3>No one.</v>

5452
02:18:29.590 --> 02:18:33.220
<v Speaker 3>I am not advocating for one about to explain film.</v>

5453
02:18:33.221 --> 02:18:34.300
<v Speaker 3>10 videos,</v>

5454
02:18:34.390 --> 02:18:39.390
<v Speaker 3>a full season of the joe rogan travel adventure by a million views on each to be</v>

5455
02:18:40.451 --> 02:18:41.500
<v Speaker 3>pat it out over a month.</v>

5456
02:18:42.130 --> 02:18:44.050
<v Speaker 3>Go to a and e.</v>

5457
02:18:44.050 --> 02:18:44.411
<v Speaker 3>Look at this show.</v>

5458
02:18:44.411 --> 02:18:46.360
<v Speaker 3>We launched million views per episode.</v>

5459
02:18:46.420 --> 02:18:47.253
<v Speaker 3>You want to buy it?</v>

5460
02:18:47.950 --> 02:18:48.670
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

02:18:48.670 --> 02:18:49.421
<v Speaker 3>Got a bunch of fans,</v>

5462
02:18:49.421 --> 02:18:50.980
<v Speaker 3>a million people watch youtube episodes.</v>

5463
02:18:51.310 --> 02:18:52.143
<v Speaker 3>Fantastic.</v>

5464
02:18:52.330 --> 02:18:52.720
<v Speaker 3>You've seen it.</v>

5465
02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:53.280
<v Speaker 3>You see what I mean?</v>

5466
02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:53.830
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5467
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:55.030
<v Speaker 3>Well if you're full of shit,</v>

5468
02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:56.231
<v Speaker 3>but hey man,</v>

5469
02:18:56.231 --> 02:18:58.720
<v Speaker 3>there are people who it's snake oil is people who do this,</v>

5470
02:18:59.020 --> 02:18:59.853
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing.</v>

5471
02:18:59.980 --> 02:19:01.990
<v Speaker 3>You get access to a network with real views.</v>

5472
02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:02.873
<v Speaker 3>You'll get traffic.</v>

5473
02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:03.700
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5474
02:19:03.700 --> 02:19:05.470
<v Speaker 3>if you can trick your way into getting on tv,</v>

5475
02:19:05.471 --> 02:19:06.304
<v Speaker 3>fake it till you make it.</v>

5476
02:19:06.820 --> 02:19:07.390
<v Speaker 3>It's dirty.</v>

5477
02:19:07.390 --> 02:19:08.280
<v Speaker 3>It's illegal,</v>

5478
02:19:08.350 --> 02:19:08.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5479
02:19:08.670 --> 02:19:09.503
<v Speaker 3>I was illegal.</v>

5480
02:19:09.700 --> 02:19:10.533
<v Speaker 3>that's fraud.</v>

5481
02:19:10.540 --> 02:19:12.470
<v Speaker 3>Well actually I don't know if that.</v>

5482
02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:13.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it is fraud if.</v>

5483
02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:13.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5484
02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:16.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm the clicks like that.</v>

5485
02:19:16.750 --> 02:19:17.110
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

5486
02:19:17.110 --> 02:19:18.100
<v Speaker 3>I think New York,</v>

5487
02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:21.700
<v Speaker 3>there was someone sent me an article that the attorney general of one state may</v>

5488
02:19:21.701 --> 02:19:22.600
<v Speaker 3>have been New York said,</v>

5489
02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:25.810
<v Speaker 3>misrepresenting yourself online through fake views,</v>

5490
02:19:25.811 --> 02:19:26.950
<v Speaker 3>clicks and likes is illegal.</v>

5491
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:31.730
<v Speaker 3>I think what they were saying is that using Other people's images to create fake</v>

5492
02:19:31.731 --> 02:19:34.010
<v Speaker 3>accounts is like invasion of privacy or something,</v>

5493
02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:35.210
<v Speaker 3>but we're getting to that point.</v>

5494
02:19:35.930 --> 02:19:36.860
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

5495
02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:39.110
<v Speaker 3>there's people who play that game.</v>

5496
02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:41.360
<v Speaker 3>I guess you can really.</v>

5497
02:19:41.390 --> 02:19:42.081
<v Speaker 3>You can really pull it off.</v>

5498
02:19:42.081 --> 02:19:43.340
<v Speaker 3>I've met a lot of people who.</v>

5499
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.931
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of tricks,</v>

5500
02:19:44.931 --> 02:19:45.530
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5501
02:19:45.530 --> 02:19:45.801
<v Speaker 3>You ever.</v>

5502
02:19:45.801 --> 02:19:46.041
<v Speaker 3>You ever.</v>

5503
02:19:46.041 --> 02:19:48.170
<v Speaker 3>You know what team follow back is from twitter.</v>

5504
02:19:48.860 --> 02:19:50.990
<v Speaker 3>you could have seen the hashtag.</v>

5505
02:19:51.140 --> 02:19:51.973
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

5506
02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:53.121
<v Speaker 3>It may have changed,</v>

5507
02:19:53.121 --> 02:19:55.910
<v Speaker 3>but essentially I follow you follow me that way.</v>

5508
02:19:55.911 --> 02:19:56.980
<v Speaker 3>You'll see some people have,</v>

5509
02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:59.830
<v Speaker 3>they'll be following 100,000 people and there'll be followed by a hunt,</v>

5510
02:19:59.860 --> 02:20:00.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5511
02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:03.800
<v Speaker 3>90,000 people and then they walk around bragging about how he got 90,000</v>

5512
02:20:03.801 --> 02:20:04.551
<v Speaker 3>followers and it's like,</v>

5513
02:20:04.551 --> 02:20:05.384
<v Speaker 3>well hold on.</v>

5514
02:20:05.860 --> 02:20:07.940
<v Speaker 3>Like you just have an agreement with them.</v>

5515
02:20:07.941 --> 02:20:08.774
<v Speaker 3>You're not influential.</v>

5516
02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:11.330
<v Speaker 3>It was a trick that people would do to inflate their numbers,</v>

5517
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:12.920
<v Speaker 3>but those numbers are legitimate.</v>

5518
02:20:12.921 --> 02:20:14.350
<v Speaker 3>If you do post something on twitter,</v>

5519
02:20:14.420 --> 02:20:15.830
<v Speaker 3>it will reach 90,000.</v>

5520
02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:16.281
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

5521
02:20:16.281 --> 02:20:17.330
<v Speaker 3>So there's definitely merit in.</v>

5522
02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:17.991
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

5523
02:20:17.991 --> 02:20:18.111
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5524
02:20:18.111 --> 02:20:18.330
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5525
02:20:18.330 --> 02:20:18.440
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

5526
02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:18.571
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

5527
02:20:18.571 --> 02:20:18.860
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

5528
02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:19.050
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

5529
02:20:19.050 --> 02:20:19.701
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it work.</v>

5530
02:20:19.701 --> 02:20:20.540
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it translate,</v>

5531
02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:21.770
<v Speaker 3>but it's just a,</v>

5532
02:20:21.770 --> 02:20:22.040
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

5533
02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:22.641
<v Speaker 3>it's a trick.</v>

5534
02:20:22.641 --> 02:20:24.140
<v Speaker 3>It's a trick of getting the system.</v>

5535
02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:24.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5536
02:20:24.740 --> 02:20:26.450
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of sneakiness going on,</v>

5537
02:20:26.480 --> 02:20:26.661
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

5538
02:20:26.661 --> 02:20:26.901
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5539
02:20:26.901 --> 02:20:28.640
<v Speaker 3>I have fake twitter followers.</v>

5540
02:20:29.460 --> 02:20:30.291
<v Speaker 3>I didn't pay for them,</v>

5541
02:20:30.291 --> 02:20:32.210
<v Speaker 3>but I've found them through one of those.</v>

5542
02:20:32.211 --> 02:20:34.220
<v Speaker 3>How many of your twitter followers are fake?</v>

5543
02:20:34.550 --> 02:20:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

5544
02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:35.810
<v Speaker 3>those aren't so good.</v>

5545
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.261
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5546
02:20:36.261 --> 02:20:36.441
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

5547
02:20:36.441 --> 02:20:37.161
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>

5548
02:20:37.161 --> 02:20:37.994
<v Speaker 3>Is it like.</v>

5549
02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.670
<v Speaker 3>So many of the people don't engage?</v>

5550
02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:41.990
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what it's based on.</v>

5551
02:20:41.991 --> 02:20:42.231
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

5552
02:20:42.231 --> 02:20:43.400
<v Speaker 3>And that doesn't make sense.</v>

5553
02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:43.661
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5554
02:20:43.661 --> 02:20:47.060
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make sense also because what if they just are logged in?</v>

5555
02:20:47.061 --> 02:20:47.810
<v Speaker 3>They just read.</v>

5556
02:20:47.810 --> 02:20:48.410
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

5557
02:20:48.410 --> 02:20:49.640
<v Speaker 3>And that's most twitter users,</v>

5558
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.851
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5559
02:20:49.851 --> 02:20:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Which is still engaging.</v>

5560
02:20:52.580 --> 02:20:54.710
<v Speaker 3>You're just not going two ways.</v>

5561
02:20:54.740 --> 02:20:57.770
<v Speaker 3>So that's one of the big problems with tracking fake accounts is that it's just</v>

5562
02:20:57.890 --> 02:20:58.760
<v Speaker 3>someone's opinion.</v>

5563
02:20:59.330 --> 02:21:00.470
<v Speaker 3>They're most hot.</v>

5564
02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:01.461
<v Speaker 3>So there's two things.</v>

5565
02:21:01.461 --> 02:21:05.240
<v Speaker 3>Most high profile accounts will read is having a ton of fake followers because</v>

5566
02:21:05.241 --> 02:21:07.790
<v Speaker 3>people will sign up just to follow you and read what you have to say because</v>

5567
02:21:07.791 --> 02:21:08.660
<v Speaker 3>they want your feet.</v>

5568
02:21:08.730 --> 02:21:10.010
<v Speaker 3>They want do they want joe,</v>

5569
02:21:10.011 --> 02:21:10.431
<v Speaker 3>they want,</v>

5570
02:21:10.431 --> 02:21:10.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5571
02:21:10.850 --> 02:21:12.950
<v Speaker 3>bill clinton or whoever and they wouldn't have that feed of people.</v>

5572
02:21:12.951 --> 02:21:13.220
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

5573
02:21:13.220 --> 02:21:15.980
<v Speaker 3>they don't interact and so then they're labeled fake.</v>

5574
02:21:16.340 --> 02:21:19.580
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is when people make fake bot farms,</v>

5575
02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:22.910
<v Speaker 3>they purposefully will follow people like you so they look real.</v>

5576
02:21:23.360 --> 02:21:24.680
<v Speaker 3>So you do get fake ones.</v>

5577
02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:25.340
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

5578
02:21:25.340 --> 02:21:25.911
<v Speaker 3>And it's hard to know,</v>

5579
02:21:25.911 --> 02:21:26.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5580
02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:28.430
<v Speaker 3>people point to politicians and always like to claim their fake followers,</v>

5581
02:21:28.431 --> 02:21:29.264
<v Speaker 3>but I'll tell you what,</v>

5582
02:21:29.660 --> 02:21:30.050
<v Speaker 3>you could.</v>

5583
02:21:30.050 --> 02:21:32.390
<v Speaker 3>You could easily go online and buy followers for someone else.</v>

5584
02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:33.310
<v Speaker 3>It happened.</v>

5585
02:21:33.310 --> 02:21:34.590
<v Speaker 3>I believe this happened to the daily dot.</v>

5586
02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:35.610
<v Speaker 3>I say I believe alex,</v>

5587
02:21:35.610 --> 02:21:36.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't wanna get sued just so you know,</v>

5588
02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:41.000
<v Speaker 3>the daily.one day jump like 30,000 twitter followers and had to put out a</v>

5589
02:21:41.001 --> 02:21:42.890
<v Speaker 3>message saying someone bought followers for us.</v>

5590
02:21:42.890 --> 02:21:43.671
<v Speaker 3>We didn't do thiS.</v>

5591
02:21:43.671 --> 02:21:45.260
<v Speaker 3>We are actively trying to remove them right now.</v>

5592
02:21:45.261 --> 02:21:47.750
<v Speaker 3>It's difficult because you don't know who's real and who's fake after it</v>

5593
02:21:47.751 --> 02:21:48.584
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>

5594
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:49.251
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

5595
02:21:49.251 --> 02:21:49.461
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

5596
02:21:49.461 --> 02:21:49.960
<v Speaker 3>there's tears.</v>

5597
02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:51.120
<v Speaker 3>You possIbly remove them though.</v>

5598
02:21:51.121 --> 02:21:55.010
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to find out what the timeline was and how quickly they came in and go</v>

5599
02:21:55.011 --> 02:21:56.220
<v Speaker 3>to each individual account.</v>

5600
02:21:56.221 --> 02:21:56.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5601
02:21:56.840 --> 02:21:57.590
<v Speaker 3>Well there's,</v>

5602
02:21:57.590 --> 02:22:00.320
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing that I think there's an app that allows you to purge what they</v>

5603
02:22:00.321 --> 02:22:01.154
<v Speaker 3>view as fake.</v>

5604
02:22:01.310 --> 02:22:03.680
<v Speaker 3>You can block and unblock them and they're not following it anymore.</v>

5605
02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:05.270
<v Speaker 3>But it's tough,</v>

5606
02:22:05.271 --> 02:22:05.511
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5607
02:22:05.511 --> 02:22:05.761
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

5608
02:22:05.761 --> 02:22:06.060
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

5609
02:22:06.060 --> 02:22:07.460
<v Speaker 3>they're terrifying ways to,</v>

5610
02:22:07.461 --> 02:22:08.294
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5611
02:22:08.450 --> 02:22:08.691
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5612
02:22:08.691 --> 02:22:10.820
<v Speaker 3>I mentioned buying views will destroy your youtube channel</v>

5613
02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:13.580
<v Speaker 3>because youtube knows their fake,</v>

5614
02:22:13.850 --> 02:22:14.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5615
02:22:14.180 --> 02:22:14.391
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5616
02:22:14.391 --> 02:22:17.750
<v Speaker 3>So think about what you can do to other people if you have three grand,</v>

5617
02:22:17.751 --> 02:22:21.420
<v Speaker 3>do you want to damage by their youtube vibe,</v>

5618
02:22:21.430 --> 02:22:24.290
<v Speaker 3>by views for them attributed to them and get them in trouble.</v>

5619
02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:28.560
<v Speaker 3>But I will say for people like you and um,</v>

5620
02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:29.431
<v Speaker 3>to an extent,</v>

5621
02:22:29.431 --> 02:22:32.430
<v Speaker 3>people like me because I have contacts at google that wouldn't work on us.</v>

5622
02:22:32.860 --> 02:22:33.900
<v Speaker 3>I just make a phone call and say,</v>

5623
02:22:33.901 --> 02:22:34.830
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted you to know and they go up,</v>

5624
02:22:34.831 --> 02:22:35.664
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>

5625
02:22:35.850 --> 02:22:38.040
<v Speaker 3>But let's say you're somebody with 100,000 subscribers,</v>

5626
02:22:38.430 --> 02:22:38.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5627
02:22:38.701 --> 02:22:39.481
<v Speaker 3>you're making a living,</v>

5628
02:22:39.481 --> 02:22:40.440
<v Speaker 3>you've got a career on youtube,</v>

5629
02:22:40.650 --> 02:22:42.720
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have a manager with youtube,</v>

5630
02:22:42.721 --> 02:22:44.040
<v Speaker 3>you don't have contacts with google.</v>

5631
02:22:44.490 --> 02:22:45.660
<v Speaker 3>If someone attacks your account,</v>

5632
02:22:46.170 --> 02:22:47.003
<v Speaker 3>you're out,</v>

5633
02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:47.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5634
02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:47.650
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

5635
02:22:47.650 --> 02:22:48.483
<v Speaker 3>they can just do that.</v>

5636
02:22:48.970 --> 02:22:49.650
<v Speaker 3>Scary.</v>

5637
02:22:49.650 --> 02:22:50.483
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5638
02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:50.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5639
02:22:50.851 --> 02:22:51.684
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5640
02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:53.280
<v Speaker 3>Jeff bezos.</v>

5641
02:22:53.580 --> 02:22:54.181
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

5642
02:22:54.181 --> 02:22:55.014
<v Speaker 3>Jeff bezos,</v>

5643
02:22:55.100 --> 02:22:55.421
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5644
02:22:55.421 --> 02:22:57.360
<v Speaker 3>Crazy is the national inquirer.</v>

5645
02:22:57.840 --> 02:22:59.040
<v Speaker 3>Allegedly we should say,</v>

5646
02:22:59.070 --> 02:22:59.903
<v Speaker 3>allegedly,</v>

5647
02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:01.500
<v Speaker 3>I believe allegedly,</v>

5648
02:23:01.530 --> 02:23:02.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get sued.</v>

5649
02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:03.960
<v Speaker 3>Tried to extort him.</v>

5650
02:23:04.530 --> 02:23:08.610
<v Speaker 3>And it's about the jamal [inaudible] shogi investigation from the Washington</v>

5651
02:23:08.611 --> 02:23:08.971
<v Speaker 3>post.</v>

5652
02:23:08.971 --> 02:23:10.170
<v Speaker 3>it's all connected to that.</v>

5653
02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:10.750
<v Speaker 3>I read,</v>

5654
02:23:10.750 --> 02:23:12.000
<v Speaker 3>I read a bit about it.</v>

5655
02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:12.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5656
02:23:12.480 --> 02:23:15.750
<v Speaker 3>I started reading more when ronan farrow came out and claimed that they went to</v>

5657
02:23:15.751 --> 02:23:16.584
<v Speaker 3>him too.</v>

5658
02:23:16.860 --> 02:23:19.770
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not as versed like I haven't read.</v>

5659
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:21.300
<v Speaker 3>I read through the day they,</v>

5660
02:23:21.370 --> 02:23:21.991
<v Speaker 3>meaning the inquiry.</v>

5661
02:23:21.991 --> 02:23:22.491
<v Speaker 3>The inquiry.</v>

5662
02:23:22.491 --> 02:23:22.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5663
02:23:22.561 --> 02:23:23.250
<v Speaker 3>Ronan farrow.</v>

5664
02:23:23.250 --> 02:23:23.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5665
02:23:23.700 --> 02:23:24.181
<v Speaker 3>it was a store,</v>

5666
02:23:24.181 --> 02:23:26.250
<v Speaker 3>I think it was from the week where I run in.</v>

5667
02:23:26.251 --> 02:23:28.080
<v Speaker 3>Pharaoh says that they approached him and,</v>

5668
02:23:28.081 --> 02:23:28.914
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

5669
02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:30.030
<v Speaker 3>put pressure on him as well.</v>

5670
02:23:30.620 --> 02:23:30.810
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

5671
02:23:30.810 --> 02:23:31.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5672
02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:33.360
<v Speaker 3>the interesting thing is when I read that story,</v>

5673
02:23:33.361 --> 02:23:34.480
<v Speaker 3>I kind of laughed because I was like,</v>

5674
02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:36.540
<v Speaker 3>remember gawker member when they public,</v>

5675
02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:37.500
<v Speaker 3>when they outdid peter teal,</v>

5676
02:23:37.501 --> 02:23:38.460
<v Speaker 3>and then yes,</v>

5677
02:23:38.570 --> 02:23:39.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5678
02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:40.470
<v Speaker 3>a hulk hogan,</v>

5679
02:23:41.250 --> 02:23:41.630
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

5680
02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:42.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5681
02:23:42.001 --> 02:23:44.790
<v Speaker 3>these people are really brave to go up against billionaires like this and try</v>

5682
02:23:44.791 --> 02:23:45.810
<v Speaker 3>and drag them.</v>

5683
02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:46.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5684
02:23:46.620 --> 02:23:47.970
<v Speaker 3>I'll also point out it's kind of scary.</v>

5685
02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.730
<v Speaker 3>You live in a world where a billionaire can destroy your company because they're</v>

5686
02:23:50.731 --> 02:23:51.564
<v Speaker 3>angry at you.</v>

5687
02:23:52.020 --> 02:23:52.730
<v Speaker 3>But my,</v>

5688
02:23:52.730 --> 02:23:57.450
<v Speaker 3>it's also kind of scary that they can use this to extort him so that he doesn't,</v>

5689
02:23:57.630 --> 02:24:02.070
<v Speaker 3>he takes the Washington post or attempting to get them to take the Washington</v>

5690
02:24:02.071 --> 02:24:05.970
<v Speaker 3>post and remove a legitimate news story about an actual murder.</v>

5691
02:24:06.180 --> 02:24:07.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust the Washington post,</v>

5692
02:24:07.411 --> 02:24:08.130
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

5693
02:24:08.130 --> 02:24:08.963
<v Speaker 3>that's an aside.</v>

5694
02:24:09.300 --> 02:24:10.770
<v Speaker 3>That Is like,</v>

5695
02:24:11.090 --> 02:24:11.923
<v Speaker 3>if you get it,</v>

5696
02:24:12.810 --> 02:24:13.643
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5697
02:24:14.490 --> 02:24:15.960
<v Speaker 3>when I look at what the national enquirer did,</v>

5698
02:24:16.590 --> 02:24:18.360
<v Speaker 3>it just reminds me of what the media does.</v>

5699
02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:20.760
<v Speaker 3>They know what they can do and they know how to do it.</v>

5700
02:24:20.820 --> 02:24:22.500
<v Speaker 3>The media is influenced its power.</v>

5701
02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:23.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5702
02:24:23.310 --> 02:24:23.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5703
02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:24.480
<v Speaker 3>brands,</v>

5704
02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:25.313
<v Speaker 3>they're scared,</v>

5705
02:24:25.410 --> 02:24:26.243
<v Speaker 3>they're scared.</v>

5706
02:24:26.370 --> 02:24:28.860
<v Speaker 3>So you look at what happens with some of these twitter accounts that will lead</v>

5707
02:24:28.861 --> 02:24:31.890
<v Speaker 3>campaigns where they encourage all their followers to send emails.</v>

5708
02:24:32.510 --> 02:24:32.960
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

5709
02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:33.400
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

5710
02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:35.340
<v Speaker 3>it's not the same as black male by no means,</v>

5711
02:24:35.730 --> 02:24:37.560
<v Speaker 3>but when you know there's an attack factor,</v>

5712
02:24:37.740 --> 02:24:38.100
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

5713
02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:38.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5714
02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:40.440
<v Speaker 3>what does that wild sardines company,</v>

5715
02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:42.990
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to deal with a brigade from activists.</v>

5716
02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:46.800
<v Speaker 3>You tweeted them your fence with them and they immediately cancel on your show</v>

5717
02:24:46.801 --> 02:24:48.960
<v Speaker 3>and they disvalue unless you do something,</v>

5718
02:24:48.961 --> 02:24:50.010
<v Speaker 3>unless you say something,</v>

5719
02:24:50.011 --> 02:24:51.090
<v Speaker 3>unless you disavow something,</v>

5720
02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:52.051
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

5721
02:24:52.051 --> 02:24:53.190
<v Speaker 3>So granted,</v>

5722
02:24:53.191 --> 02:24:54.390
<v Speaker 3>It's leaps and bounds worse when,</v>

5723
02:24:54.420 --> 02:24:54.750
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

5724
02:24:54.750 --> 02:24:56.490
<v Speaker 3>when the national inquirer allegedly,</v>

5725
02:24:57.120 --> 02:24:57.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5726
02:24:57.450 --> 02:24:59.370
<v Speaker 3>tries to extort Jeff Bezos.</v>

5727
02:24:59.530 --> 02:25:01.230
<v Speaker 3>The craziest thing about it is allegedly,</v>

5728
02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:01.891
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

5729
02:25:01.891 --> 02:25:04.680
<v Speaker 3>allegedly that the investigator,</v>

5730
02:25:04.681 --> 02:25:05.520
<v Speaker 3>I think his name is becker,</v>

5731
02:25:06.420 --> 02:25:10.770
<v Speaker 3>was entertaining the possibility that a government entity intercepted the texts,</v>

5732
02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:12.780
<v Speaker 3>the nude selfies from those.</v>

5733
02:25:13.170 --> 02:25:15.990
<v Speaker 3>But I did see another journalist tweet that they're not entertaining,</v>

5734
02:25:15.991 --> 02:25:16.890
<v Speaker 3>that they're not pursuing it.</v>

5735
02:25:16.910 --> 02:25:17.611
<v Speaker 3>It was just a thought.</v>

5736
02:25:17.611 --> 02:25:18.660
<v Speaker 3>So maybe it's not real.</v>

5737
02:25:18.750 --> 02:25:18.871
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5738
02:25:18.871 --> 02:25:21.510
<v Speaker 3>part of the thought was that his girlfriend's brother,</v>

5739
02:25:21.511 --> 02:25:24.100
<v Speaker 3>who a trump supporter might might've somehow or another got</v>

5740
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:26.170
<v Speaker 2>screen grabs of her phone.</v>

5741
02:25:26.890 --> 02:25:28.300
<v Speaker 2>It was really interesting when bezos said,</v>

5742
02:25:28.330 --> 02:25:32.570
<v Speaker 2>because he owns the post people per people presume he's their enemy and that's</v>

5743
02:25:32.610 --> 02:25:32.810
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

5744
02:25:32.810 --> 02:25:35.650
<v Speaker 2>That's another point I would bring up to when it comes to like banning Alex</v>

5745
02:25:35.650 --> 02:25:35.980
<v Speaker 2>Jones,</v>

5746
02:25:35.980 --> 02:25:38.590
<v Speaker 2>just because someone's reporting something doesn't mean they're advocating for</v>

5747
02:25:38.591 --> 02:25:39.424
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

5748
02:25:39.490 --> 02:25:40.540
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes they are.</v>

5749
02:25:40.541 --> 02:25:42.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like you've got to understand the nuance in that.</v>

5750
02:25:42.810 --> 02:25:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5751
02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:44.050
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

5752
02:25:44.051 --> 02:25:47.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean bezos is probably not the person you'd want to target.</v>

5753
02:25:47.021 --> 02:25:49.930
<v Speaker 2>I could you imagine what would happen if bayzos showed up at the Washington post</v>

5754
02:25:49.931 --> 02:25:50.231
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>

5755
02:25:50.231 --> 02:25:51.064
<v Speaker 2>guys killed the story.</v>

5756
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:53.400
<v Speaker 2>Every journalist would tweet it based.</v>

5757
02:25:53.410 --> 02:25:54.610
<v Speaker 2>I'll shut up and just killed our story.</v>

5758
02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5759
02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:56.340
<v Speaker 2>It's almost impossible.</v>

5760
02:25:56.370 --> 02:25:56.560
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

5761
02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:57.550
<v Speaker 2>so unrealistic,</v>

5762
02:25:57.551 --> 02:25:58.720
<v Speaker 2>but maybe there's more to it.</v>

5763
02:25:59.110 --> 02:25:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5764
02:25:59.650 --> 02:26:00.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5765
02:26:00.050 --> 02:26:00.211
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5766
02:26:00.211 --> 02:26:01.120
<v Speaker 2>the real,</v>

5767
02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:02.330
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5768
02:26:02.330 --> 02:26:05.140
<v Speaker 2>and this is the big conspiracy theory was that,</v>

5769
02:26:05.141 --> 02:26:05.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5770
02:26:05.710 --> 02:26:07.330
<v Speaker 2>trump always calls him jeff bozo.</v>

5771
02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:08.061
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

5772
02:26:08.061 --> 02:26:08.280
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

5773
02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:08.441
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5774
02:26:08.441 --> 02:26:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Someone from that side is involved in this.</v>

5775
02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5776
02:26:12.570 --> 02:26:13.060
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

5777
02:26:13.060 --> 02:26:15.170
<v Speaker 2>because trump's always had this relationship with the inquirer.</v>

5778
02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Big concern.</v>

5779
02:26:16.430 --> 02:26:16.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5780
02:26:16.521 --> 02:26:16.651
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

5781
02:26:16.651 --> 02:26:17.230
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5782
02:26:17.230 --> 02:26:17.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5783
02:26:17.471 --> 02:26:18.760
<v Speaker 2>so I don't,</v>

5784
02:26:18.761 --> 02:26:19.121
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5785
02:26:19.121 --> 02:26:19.570
<v Speaker 2>I guess I,</v>

5786
02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:20.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5787
02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:23.680
<v Speaker 2>this is relatively new story and I've been here so I don't know as much about it</v>

5788
02:26:23.681 --> 02:26:24.410
<v Speaker 2>as I probably should,</v>

5789
02:26:24.410 --> 02:26:28.810
<v Speaker 2>which just shows you how crazy digital media is it digital things like sending</v>

5790
02:26:28.811 --> 02:26:30.910
<v Speaker 2>things through the air and it's just</v>

5791
02:26:32.470 --> 02:26:34.300
<v Speaker 2>that people can get intercepted.</v>

5792
02:26:34.570 --> 02:26:35.403
<v Speaker 2>That's whY,</v>

5793
02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:35.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5794
02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:36.070
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

5795
02:26:36.070 --> 02:26:38.050
<v Speaker 2>when I mentioned earlier the potential for civil war,</v>

5796
02:26:38.051 --> 02:26:39.010
<v Speaker 2>like we don't know what it could look like.</v>

5797
02:26:39.011 --> 02:26:39.790
<v Speaker 2>This could be it,</v>

5798
02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:41.890
<v Speaker 2>it could be special interests using information.</v>

5799
02:26:41.891 --> 02:26:43.020
<v Speaker 2>It's the infOrmation war,</v>

5800
02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:43.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5801
02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:44.200
<v Speaker 2>things that people have talked about.</v>

5802
02:26:44.770 --> 02:26:46.060
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about this a while ago.</v>

5803
02:26:46.061 --> 02:26:46.301
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

5804
02:26:46.301 --> 02:26:46.541
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5805
02:26:46.541 --> 02:26:46.871
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

5806
02:26:46.871 --> 02:26:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Why did people shoot each other 100 years ago?</v>

5807
02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:49.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean still do,</v>

5808
02:26:49.630 --> 02:26:50.380
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

5809
02:26:50.380 --> 02:26:50.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5810
02:26:50.591 --> 02:26:51.040
<v Speaker 2>world war ii,</v>

5811
02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:51.670
<v Speaker 2>why are they running it?</v>

5812
02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Because they wanted to gain control.</v>

5813
02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:54.220
<v Speaker 2>They wanted,</v>

5814
02:26:54.220 --> 02:26:58.330
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to centralize power or they wanted to push an ideology or a</v>

5815
02:26:58.331 --> 02:26:59.650
<v Speaker 2>government or expand their power.</v>

5816
02:27:00.340 --> 02:27:01.450
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to shoot somebody to do that.</v>

5817
02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:05.230
<v Speaker 2>You just need to convince them you're right or you need to get them to fight</v>

5818
02:27:05.231 --> 02:27:06.064
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

5819
02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:07.480
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's fair to say,</v>

5820
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:07.781
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5821
02:27:07.781 --> 02:27:09.250
<v Speaker 2>the russians are absolutely screwing with us,</v>

5822
02:27:09.580 --> 02:27:12.580
<v Speaker 2>but we've learned through if you trust the reporting and it's hard to know</v>

5823
02:27:12.581 --> 02:27:14.650
<v Speaker 2>what's real or not that the russian campaigns,</v>

5824
02:27:14.651 --> 02:27:16.510
<v Speaker 2>we're not only promoting trump supporters,</v>

5825
02:27:16.570 --> 02:27:17.920
<v Speaker 2>but they were promoting black lives matter.</v>

5826
02:27:18.370 --> 02:27:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Why gIve him to fight?</v>

5827
02:27:20.290 --> 02:27:20.441
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5828
02:27:20.441 --> 02:27:21.490
<v Speaker 2>they weren't just doing that.</v>

5829
02:27:21.491 --> 02:27:26.200
<v Speaker 2>There's a fantastic podcast that sam harris released recently with a woman.</v>

5830
02:27:26.201 --> 02:27:26.441
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>

5831
02:27:26.441 --> 02:27:29.920
<v Speaker 2>let me get her name so I can see if you can find a jamie.</v>

5832
02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:32.080
<v Speaker 2>It's called the information war.</v>

5833
02:27:32.110 --> 02:27:33.730
<v Speaker 2>That's the name of the podcast.</v>

5834
02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:34.900
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

5835
02:27:34.900 --> 02:27:35.680
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

5836
02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:40.000
<v Speaker 2>they were doIng all sorts of different things,</v>

5837
02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:43.030
<v Speaker 2>like not just trying to.</v>

5838
02:27:43.370 --> 02:27:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Rene de arrest,</v>

5839
02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:49.270
<v Speaker 2>teresita and I'm working on getting her down here soon that they were.</v>

5840
02:27:49.271 --> 02:27:52.420
<v Speaker 2>They also had like a Texas culture.</v>

5841
02:27:52.650 --> 02:27:54.700
<v Speaker 2>They had trans rights.</v>

5842
02:27:54.701 --> 02:27:55.230
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

5843
02:27:55.230 --> 02:27:55.600
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

5844
02:27:55.600 --> 02:28:00.130
<v Speaker 2>they even organize facebook campaigns where they had a pro Texas group and a pro</v>

5845
02:28:00.131 --> 02:28:02.300
<v Speaker 2>muslim group meet across the street from each other.</v>

5846
02:28:02.301 --> 02:28:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5847
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:03.671
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're,</v>

5848
02:28:03.671 --> 02:28:06.130
<v Speaker 2>they're sowing seeds of descent,</v>

5849
02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:08.800
<v Speaker 2>like organizing it and I think I,</v>

5850
02:28:08.801 --> 02:28:11.500
<v Speaker 2>I'd be willing to entertain the possibility that what we call the culture war</v>

5851
02:28:11.501 --> 02:28:13.990
<v Speaker 2>today was seated specifically by special interests,</v>

5852
02:28:14.020 --> 02:28:14.853
<v Speaker 2>potentially Russia.</v>

5853
02:28:15.610 --> 02:28:16.443
<v Speaker 2>Nothing we can do about it.</v>

5854
02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:17.410
<v Speaker 2>It's done.</v>

5855
02:28:17.410 --> 02:28:17.661
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5856
02:28:17.661 --> 02:28:17.801
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

5857
02:28:17.801 --> 02:28:18.040
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

5858
02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:19.660
<v Speaker 2>when people adopt an ideology,</v>

5859
02:28:20.230 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 2>you can easily that and some people</v>

5860
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:23.390
<v Speaker 1>refuse to cross that divide,</v>

5861
02:28:23.780 --> 02:28:24.080
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

5862
02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:24.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5863
02:28:24.261 --> 02:28:27.530
<v Speaker 1>But it's just so funny how many different ways they were attacking this.</v>

5864
02:28:27.531 --> 02:28:29.560
<v Speaker 1>They had a blue lives matter groups,</v>

5865
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:31.130
<v Speaker 1>black lives matter groups,</v>

5866
02:28:31.131 --> 02:28:34.160
<v Speaker 1>and they put people at odds with each other and one of the big ones that they</v>

5867
02:28:34.161 --> 02:28:35.570
<v Speaker 1>did was they,</v>

5868
02:28:35.690 --> 02:28:40.670
<v Speaker 1>they targeted african americans and we're trying to get them to vote for anyone</v>

5869
02:28:40.671 --> 02:28:41.504
<v Speaker 1>other than hillary.</v>

5870
02:28:41.660 --> 02:28:45.360
<v Speaker 1>And this is like an engineered campaign that jill stein's our vote and we like,</v>

5871
02:28:45.361 --> 02:28:46.880
<v Speaker 1>we can't vote for hillary.</v>

5872
02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Like hillary does not support us.</v>

5873
02:28:48.711 --> 02:28:49.820
<v Speaker 1>We can't vote for hillary.</v>

5874
02:28:49.821 --> 02:28:51.260
<v Speaker 1>And so it made it very tribal.</v>

5875
02:28:51.370 --> 02:28:52.120
<v Speaker 3>The first thing we have,</v>

5876
02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:57.120
<v Speaker 3>we have to assume is that it was effective and what we view in the culture war</v>

5877
02:28:57.281 --> 02:29:00.430
<v Speaker 3>was exacerbated by these campaigns.</v>

5878
02:29:00.850 --> 02:29:01.271
<v Speaker 3>We don't know,</v>

5879
02:29:01.271 --> 02:29:04.180
<v Speaker 3>we don't know to what extent they had an influence over the us,</v>

5880
02:29:04.510 --> 02:29:08.230
<v Speaker 3>but I will say I think it's fair to point out they play a role and then we can</v>

5881
02:29:08.231 --> 02:29:08.950
<v Speaker 3>see what happens.</v>

5882
02:29:08.950 --> 02:29:09.783
<v Speaker 3>Charlottesville,</v>

5883
02:29:10.010 --> 02:29:10.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5884
02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:14.950
<v Speaker 3>where we can see the dramatic escalation where you end up with some crazy guy</v>

5885
02:29:15.190 --> 02:29:19.030
<v Speaker 3>associated with white nationalism ramming a car into a bunch of protesters.</v>

5886
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.790
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

5887
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:19.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5888
02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:23.620
<v Speaker 3>people get riled up to a point as a really great video called this video will</v>

5889
02:29:23.621 --> 02:29:25.060
<v Speaker 3>make you angry by,</v>

5890
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5891
02:29:25.660 --> 02:29:29.950
<v Speaker 3>cgp grey where he talks about how these groups,</v>

5892
02:29:30.250 --> 02:29:32.110
<v Speaker 3>they argue amongst each other,</v>

5893
02:29:32.380 --> 02:29:33.460
<v Speaker 3>not against each other.</v>

5894
02:29:34.030 --> 02:29:36.610
<v Speaker 3>They make each other angry By posting images of the other,</v>

5895
02:29:36.840 --> 02:29:37.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5896
02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:38.110
<v Speaker 3>there's certain subreddits.</v>

5897
02:29:38.111 --> 02:29:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Why I don't want to start a brigade,</v>

5898
02:29:39.911 --> 02:29:43.300
<v Speaker 3>but they'll post memes nonstop attacking a particular politician.</v>

5899
02:29:43.720 --> 02:29:45.880
<v Speaker 3>They're not arguing with the left or the right.</v>

5900
02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:49.180
<v Speaker 3>They're arguing to themselves about what's wrong with the other.</v>

5901
02:29:49.590 --> 02:29:51.760
<v Speaker 3>And so these groups grow and get angrier and angrier.</v>

5902
02:29:51.880 --> 02:29:53.380
<v Speaker 3>And then when they finally meet in the real world,</v>

5903
02:29:53.381 --> 02:29:54.520
<v Speaker 3>you get extreme violence.</v>

5904
02:29:55.210 --> 02:29:56.860
<v Speaker 3>So it's very,</v>

5905
02:29:56.950 --> 02:30:00.100
<v Speaker 3>it's very possible to seed those communities and rile people up,</v>

5906
02:30:00.470 --> 02:30:01.360
<v Speaker 3>push these things.</v>

5907
02:30:01.530 --> 02:30:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5908
02:30:02.250 --> 02:30:03.210
<v Speaker 1>well it's also,</v>

5909
02:30:03.700 --> 02:30:07.110
<v Speaker 1>it seems pretty straightforward how to manipulate them and how to appeal to</v>

5910
02:30:07.111 --> 02:30:10.890
<v Speaker 1>their tribal nature and it's terrifying how easy it is.</v>

5911
02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

5912
02:30:11.900 --> 02:30:12.151
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

5913
02:30:12.151 --> 02:30:14.790
<v Speaker 1>the store is so terrifying how few people are aware that,</v>

5914
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of these really toxic pages that you'll find that they're</v>

5915
02:30:19.531 --> 02:30:20.970
<v Speaker 1>commenting on things that are,</v>

5916
02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:24.270
<v Speaker 1>whether it's instagram or twitter or whatever they're not,</v>

5917
02:30:24.570 --> 02:30:26.460
<v Speaker 1>they're not really who you think they are</v>

5918
02:30:26.730 --> 02:30:27.690
<v Speaker 3>and what ends up happening.</v>

5919
02:30:28.260 --> 02:30:29.940
<v Speaker 3>The average person say on twitter,</v>

5920
02:30:30.240 --> 02:30:33.000
<v Speaker 3>we'll look at their mentions and see 10 tweets where they say,</v>

5921
02:30:33.150 --> 02:30:34.650
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't talk about this anymore.</v>

5922
02:30:34.651 --> 02:30:35.400
<v Speaker 3>How dare you.</v>

5923
02:30:35.400 --> 02:30:38.610
<v Speaker 3>And they'll assume everyone when in reality could be one person,</v>

5924
02:30:39.090 --> 02:30:39.930
<v Speaker 3>but it works well.</v>

5925
02:30:39.931 --> 02:30:40.360
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>

5926
02:30:40.360 --> 02:30:44.070
<v Speaker 3>this is what gets companies to run away from sponsoring shows and stuff.</v>

5927
02:30:44.100 --> 02:30:45.570
<v Speaker 3>They think everyone's attacking them.</v>

5928
02:30:46.290 --> 02:30:46.951
<v Speaker 1>It could be one person.</v>

5929
02:30:46.951 --> 02:30:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think this goes?</v>

5930
02:30:48.210 --> 02:30:48.571
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>

5931
02:30:48.571 --> 02:30:50.940
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking aT this like this is fairly new,</v>

5932
02:30:50.941 --> 02:30:51.211
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5933
02:30:51.211 --> 02:30:54.330
<v Speaker 1>all of this stuff is fairly new and and really kind of a,</v>

5934
02:30:54.390 --> 02:30:58.190
<v Speaker 1>this is uncharted territory in terms of how to navigate this stuff and they're</v>

5935
02:30:58.410 --> 02:31:01.920
<v Speaker 1>sort of figuring out what the influences are as we go along.</v>

5936
02:31:01.950 --> 02:31:02.783
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

5937
02:31:02.790 --> 02:31:04.140
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago this didn't even exist.</v>

5938
02:31:04.141 --> 02:31:05.760
<v Speaker 1>So this is all all new.</v>

5939
02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think it's going?</v>

5940
02:31:06.770 --> 02:31:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Usd.</v>

5941
02:31:07.300 --> 02:31:08.133
<v Speaker 3>Stabilization,</v>

5942
02:31:08.220 --> 02:31:08.861
<v Speaker 3>real and edit.</v>

5943
02:31:08.861 --> 02:31:09.650
<v Speaker 3>Dangerous.</v>

5944
02:31:09.650 --> 02:31:10.483
<v Speaker 3>Dangerous level.</v>

5945
02:31:11.990 --> 02:31:13.850
<v Speaker 3>So patrion,</v>

5946
02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:14.600
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5947
02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:15.111
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>

5948
02:31:15.111 --> 02:31:16.940
<v Speaker 3>it's the independent economy.</v>

5949
02:31:16.941 --> 02:31:17.751
<v Speaker 3>If you're a youtuber,</v>

5950
02:31:17.751 --> 02:31:18.680
<v Speaker 3>if you're a podcaster,</v>

5951
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:19.530
<v Speaker 3>if you're an,</v>

5952
02:31:19.530 --> 02:31:20.790
<v Speaker 3>if you're a cost play or whatever.</v>

5953
02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:25.260
<v Speaker 3>Well they decided to band Some people for reasons that don't make sense.</v>

5954
02:31:25.261 --> 02:31:27.180
<v Speaker 3>Like sargon didn't violate the tos,</v>

5955
02:31:27.181 --> 02:31:27.870
<v Speaker 3>but they banned in many ways.</v>

5956
02:31:27.870 --> 02:31:29.140
<v Speaker 3>So sargon goes to subscribe.</v>

5957
02:31:29.141 --> 02:31:33.150
<v Speaker 3>Star activists then decide sargon and shouldn't be allowed to make money,</v>

5958
02:31:33.151 --> 02:31:33.984
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>

5959
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.830
<v Speaker 3>So they start,</v>

5960
02:31:35.010 --> 02:31:35.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5961
02:31:35.430 --> 02:31:36.280
<v Speaker 3>campaigning unsubscribed,</v>

5962
02:31:36.330 --> 02:31:36.571
<v Speaker 3>star,</v>

5963
02:31:36.571 --> 02:31:37.590
<v Speaker 3>subscribes to our loses,</v>

5964
02:31:37.591 --> 02:31:41.460
<v Speaker 3>access to paypal and stripe so it can no longer process payments.</v>

5965
02:31:41.461 --> 02:31:43.470
<v Speaker 3>Who made that decision to remove it?</v>

5966
02:31:43.830 --> 02:31:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Most likely pay pal,</v>

5967
02:31:44.941 --> 02:31:45.271
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>

5968
02:31:45.271 --> 02:31:46.410
<v Speaker 3>I believe they sent on the website.</v>

5969
02:31:46.440 --> 02:31:47.060
<v Speaker 3>Paypal,</v>

5970
02:31:47.060 --> 02:31:47.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5971
02:31:47.340 --> 02:31:48.690
<v Speaker 3>because what happens is people get scared,</v>

5972
02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:48.880
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5973
02:31:48.880 --> 02:31:50.130
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to be involved in this.</v>

5974
02:31:50.580 --> 02:31:51.540
<v Speaker 3>While something else happened,</v>

5975
02:31:51.660 --> 02:31:53.820
<v Speaker 3>subscribes are reactivated there.</v>

5976
02:31:53.821 --> 02:31:54.990
<v Speaker 3>They've got new payment processor,</v>

5977
02:31:55.200 --> 02:31:57.860
<v Speaker 3>which means we've seen the budding off of an,</v>

5978
02:31:57.940 --> 02:31:58.280
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

5979
02:31:58.280 --> 02:31:59.430
<v Speaker 3>of a mirror economy,</v>

5980
02:31:59.760 --> 02:32:00.690
<v Speaker 3>which is dangerous.</v>

5981
02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:05.850
<v Speaker 3>The fact that americanS in general can't share the same platform and had to</v>

5982
02:32:05.851 --> 02:32:06.810
<v Speaker 3>create an alternate,</v>

5983
02:32:06.990 --> 02:32:10.110
<v Speaker 3>an alternate that had to be supported by separate means.</v>

5984
02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:12.600
<v Speaker 3>If this continues in that direction,</v>

5985
02:32:12.660 --> 02:32:15.660
<v Speaker 3>we're going to end up with tons of systems that operate for only certain</v>

5986
02:32:15.661 --> 02:32:16.650
<v Speaker 3>political factions.</v>

02:32:25.290 --> 02:32:27.700
<v Speaker 3>What does what I say in the world had to do with what you,</v>

5994
02:32:27.750 --> 02:32:28.740
<v Speaker 3>what service you provide.</v>

5995
02:32:29.340 --> 02:32:29.581
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

5996
02:32:29.581 --> 02:32:30.330
<v Speaker 3>by all means,</v>

5997
02:32:30.330 --> 02:32:30.991
<v Speaker 3>if you want to bend them,</v>

5998
02:32:30.991 --> 02:32:31.824
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

5999
02:32:31.890 --> 02:32:34.110
<v Speaker 3>but you can then see the adopting of ideology.</v>

6000
02:32:34.530 --> 02:32:38.280
<v Speaker 3>Someone posted a funny comment accompany that refuses to sell water to a</v>

6001
02:32:38.281 --> 02:32:40.830
<v Speaker 3>dehydrated man in the desert because they think the wrong thing.</v>

6002
02:32:41.340 --> 02:32:42.240
<v Speaker 3>But then what happens?</v>

6003
02:32:42.390 --> 02:32:46.920
<v Speaker 3>Different companies emerge and you'd get tribes that are divided not only by</v>

6004
02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:47.731
<v Speaker 3>their ideology,</v>

6005
02:32:47.731 --> 02:32:50.130
<v Speaker 3>but literally they're unable to communicate with each other.</v>

6006
02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:52.410
<v Speaker 3>That can only lead to one thing.</v>

6007
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:54.180
<v Speaker 3>The tribes getting physical,</v>

6008
02:32:54.690 --> 02:32:55.351
<v Speaker 3>charlottesville,</v>

6009
02:32:55.351 --> 02:32:56.990
<v Speaker 3>portland ball to a.</v>

6010
02:32:56.991 --> 02:32:59.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm a boston berkeley,</v>

6011
02:32:59.970 --> 02:33:00.960
<v Speaker 3>san bernardino.</v>

6012
02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:02.640
<v Speaker 3>These various instances where the.</v>

6013
02:33:02.820 --> 02:33:04.290
<v Speaker 3>They've claShed and bashed each other.</v>

6014
02:33:04.291 --> 02:33:05.190
<v Speaker 3>People have been killed.</v>

6015
02:33:05.520 --> 02:33:06.990
<v Speaker 3>Some people show up with guns.</v>

6016
02:33:08.190 --> 02:33:09.023
<v Speaker 3>I think that's.</v>

6017
02:33:09.540 --> 02:33:10.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't I,</v>

6018
02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:10.950
<v Speaker 3>I've got to be honest.</v>

6019
02:33:12.210 --> 02:33:13.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's a way to fix it.</v>

6020
02:33:13.440 --> 02:33:14.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't really.</v>

6021
02:33:14.600 --> 02:33:15.301
<v Speaker 3>There is a,</v>

6022
02:33:15.301 --> 02:33:16.470
<v Speaker 3>a hilarious comment.</v>

6023
02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:17.131
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

6024
02:33:17.131 --> 02:33:21.750
<v Speaker 3>Comic programmer humor on reddit and they said when you talk to an airplane</v>

6025
02:33:21.751 --> 02:33:23.550
<v Speaker 3>engineer or mechanic,</v>

6026
02:33:23.551 --> 02:33:23.880
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

6027
02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:24.181
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

6028
02:33:24.181 --> 02:33:25.950
<v Speaker 3>these things are engineered safety.</v>

6029
02:33:25.951 --> 02:33:26.141
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

6030
02:33:26.141 --> 02:33:28.140
<v Speaker 3>you're more likely to get new car accident and died in an airplane.</v>

6031
02:33:28.590 --> 02:33:28.831
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6032
02:33:28.831 --> 02:33:30.300
<v Speaker 3>when you talk to electrical engineers,</v>

6033
02:33:30.330 --> 02:33:30.691
<v Speaker 3>oh god,</v>

6034
02:33:30.691 --> 02:33:33.000
<v Speaker 3>we've got so many redundancies that the system will fail.</v>

6035
02:33:33.001 --> 02:33:33.834
<v Speaker 3>If you know,</v>

6036
02:33:33.930 --> 02:33:34.980
<v Speaker 3>when you talk to a programmer,</v>

6037
02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:35.640
<v Speaker 3>everything's,</v>

6038
02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:36.450
<v Speaker 3>everything's bad.</v>

6039
02:33:36.450 --> 02:33:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Voting machines or corrupt,</v>

6040
02:33:37.530 --> 02:33:38.370
<v Speaker 3>the system is failing.</v>

6041
02:33:38.370 --> 02:33:39.203
<v Speaker 3>We can't secure it.</v>

6042
02:33:40.140 --> 02:33:42.600
<v Speaker 3>like there was a kid at defcon hacker convention who.</v>

6043
02:33:42.601 --> 02:33:43.620
<v Speaker 3>Active voting machine like that,</v>

6044
02:33:44.030 --> 02:33:44.910
<v Speaker 3>like the whole system is.</v>

6045
02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:46.080
<v Speaker 3>I got to say,</v>

6046
02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:47.550
<v Speaker 3>you know that story I told you about high times,</v>

6047
02:33:48.030 --> 02:33:49.200
<v Speaker 3>imagine if someone did that,</v>

6048
02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:53.250
<v Speaker 3>but it was a political story in how easy would it be to rile people up and</v>

6049
02:33:53.251 --> 02:33:53.770
<v Speaker 3>getting violent.</v>

6050
02:33:53.770 --> 02:33:53.961
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

6051
02:33:53.961 --> 02:33:54.340
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

6052
02:33:54.340 --> 02:33:54.620
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

6053
02:33:54.620 --> 02:33:54.861
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

6054
02:33:54.861 --> 02:33:55.890
<v Speaker 3>it's dangerously easy.</v>

6055
02:33:55.891 --> 02:33:56.724
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying.</v>

6056
02:33:56.860 --> 02:34:00.390
<v Speaker 3>It's very easy to get people riled up with fig stories and,</v>

6057
02:34:00.450 --> 02:34:01.201
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

6058
02:34:01.201 --> 02:34:02.340
<v Speaker 3>and once they go viral</v>

6059
02:34:03.930 --> 02:34:04.763
<v Speaker 3>there's no stopping it.</v>

6060
02:34:04.820 --> 02:34:09.330
<v Speaker 3>And I think we're seeing a really even more terrifying phenomenon in that even</v>

6061
02:34:09.331 --> 02:34:11.160
<v Speaker 3>when we have evidence in front of our eyes,</v>

6062
02:34:11.220 --> 02:34:12.053
<v Speaker 3>covington,</v>

6063
02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:13.073
<v Speaker 3>people refuse.</v>

6064
02:34:13.370 --> 02:34:14.610
<v Speaker 3>Reza aslan for instance,</v>

6065
02:34:14.850 --> 02:34:15.683
<v Speaker 3>he won't back down.</v>

6066
02:34:16.020 --> 02:34:16.860
<v Speaker 3>It's like the,</v>

6067
02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:17.330
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

6068
02:34:17.330 --> 02:34:17.920
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

6069
02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:22.920
<v Speaker 3>it was the first video that just shows the one kid standing next to philips that</v>

6070
02:34:23.081 --> 02:34:23.500
<v Speaker 3>goes viral.</v>

6071
02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:25.060
<v Speaker 3>I can understand why people saw that and were like,</v>

6072
02:34:25.061 --> 02:34:25.894
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

6073
02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:27.490
<v Speaker 3>But the second video that went viral,</v>

6074
02:34:27.491 --> 02:34:31.210
<v Speaker 3>almost the exact same time showed phillips walk up to the kid immediately</v>

6075
02:34:31.211 --> 02:34:33.520
<v Speaker 3>disproving the original narrative of the kid approached him.</v>

6076
02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:35.290
<v Speaker 3>but even bill maher still got it wrong.</v>

6077
02:34:35.890 --> 02:34:36.250
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

6078
02:34:36.250 --> 02:34:38.650
<v Speaker 3>So even when people can see exactly what happened,</v>

6079
02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:39.850
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't fit their narrative,</v>

6080
02:34:39.851 --> 02:34:40.560
<v Speaker 3>don't believe it.</v>

6081
02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:40.900
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

6082
02:34:40.900 --> 02:34:43.900
<v Speaker 3>and there was an article that I think it may have been in gizmodo or deadspin or</v>

6083
02:34:43.901 --> 02:34:44.734
<v Speaker 3>something that said,</v>

6084
02:34:45.570 --> 02:34:46.600
<v Speaker 3>don't listen to them.</v>

6085
02:34:46.660 --> 02:34:48.820
<v Speaker 3>We all know what we saw and it's like,</v>

6086
02:34:48.821 --> 02:34:49.410
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

6087
02:34:49.410 --> 02:34:52.930
<v Speaker 3>that's if we're getting to the point where kids at a blackout basketball game we</v>

6088
02:34:52.931 --> 02:34:54.970
<v Speaker 3>have aren't black body paint and throwing up three pointers.</v>

6089
02:34:54.971 --> 02:34:56.020
<v Speaker 3>Signs is nazis.</v>

6090
02:34:56.530 --> 02:34:56.921
<v Speaker 3>How do you,</v>

6091
02:34:56.921 --> 02:34:58.270
<v Speaker 3>how do you bring those people back from that,</v>

6092
02:34:58.271 --> 02:34:58.930
<v Speaker 3>from the brink?</v>

6093
02:34:58.930 --> 02:34:59.200
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

6094
02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:00.011
<v Speaker 3>and I'll say this too,</v>

6095
02:35:00.011 --> 02:35:01.450
<v Speaker 3>like I obviously have been,</v>

6096
02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:01.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6097
02:35:01.741 --> 02:35:01.960
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

6098
02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:02.670
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

6099
02:35:02.670 --> 02:35:03.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6100
02:35:03.250 --> 02:35:05.170
<v Speaker 3>didn't mention alt right violence all that often.</v>

6101
02:35:05.530 --> 02:35:07.330
<v Speaker 3>But then you have to realize the alt right is tiny,</v>

6102
02:35:07.390 --> 02:35:07.661
<v Speaker 3>tiny,</v>

6103
02:35:07.661 --> 02:35:07.841
<v Speaker 3>tiny,</v>

6104
02:35:07.841 --> 02:35:08.320
<v Speaker 3>tiny.</v>

6105
02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:08.621
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

6106
02:35:08.621 --> 02:35:09.454
<v Speaker 3>they're rare.</v>

6107
02:35:09.460 --> 02:35:10.420
<v Speaker 3>They've admitted defeat.</v>

6108
02:35:10.450 --> 02:35:10.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6109
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:11.650
<v Speaker 3>Richard Spencer said,</v>

6110
02:35:11.710 --> 02:35:13.900
<v Speaker 3>I think he said this at antifa one or something.</v>

6111
02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:14.950
<v Speaker 3>No one showed up.</v>

6112
02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:15.910
<v Speaker 3>He had an event in Florida.</v>

6113
02:35:15.911 --> 02:35:16.780
<v Speaker 3>11 people shut up.</v>

6114
02:35:16.781 --> 02:35:17.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm not worried about that guY.</v>

6115
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:20.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried about these fringe ideologies that are racist,</v>

6116
02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:22.360
<v Speaker 3>intolerant and violent.</v>

6117
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:24.400
<v Speaker 3>Slowly seeping into our culture.</v>

6118
02:35:24.790 --> 02:35:29.790
<v Speaker 3>Like when you see a politician's openly embrace like race based government</v>

6119
02:35:31.991 --> 02:35:32.824
<v Speaker 3>policy,</v>

6120
02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:34.830
<v Speaker 3>it's really does worry me,</v>

6121
02:35:35.020 --> 02:35:35.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6122
02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:36.430
<v Speaker 3>my I,</v>

6123
02:35:36.430 --> 02:35:40.960
<v Speaker 3>I think I have this perspective growing up in a mixed race family where I've</v>

6124
02:35:40.961 --> 02:35:44.410
<v Speaker 3>been insulted by the left for being white and I've been insulted by far right</v>

6125
02:35:44.411 --> 02:35:47.950
<v Speaker 3>racists for being and so I don't like either of it.</v>

6126
02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:48.873
<v Speaker 3>I reallY don't,</v>

6127
02:35:49.300 --> 02:35:53.170
<v Speaker 3>but the white supremacists types are falling apart and they don't threaten me</v>

6128
02:35:53.171 --> 02:35:53.720
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

6129
02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:53.890
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

6130
02:35:53.890 --> 02:35:54.250
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

6131
02:35:54.250 --> 02:35:55.083
<v Speaker 3>they just don't,</v>

6132
02:35:55.300 --> 02:35:59.620
<v Speaker 3>but the left wing racism and the and these ideas of racial equity and</v>

6133
02:35:59.621 --> 02:36:02.290
<v Speaker 3>determining what your worth based on the color of your skin are becoming more</v>

6134
02:36:02.291 --> 02:36:03.130
<v Speaker 3>and more pervasive.</v>

6135
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:05.340
<v Speaker 3>the lawsuit with harvard that,</v>

6136
02:36:05.420 --> 02:36:07.330
<v Speaker 3>that asians have a harder standard,</v>

6137
02:36:07.690 --> 02:36:10.690
<v Speaker 3>a tougher standard for getting in even though agents or a smaller minority than</v>

6138
02:36:10.691 --> 02:36:11.524
<v Speaker 3>white people.</v>

6139
02:36:11.530 --> 02:36:12.490
<v Speaker 3>Why does that make sense?</v>

6140
02:36:12.850 --> 02:36:16.360
<v Speaker 3>why should I have to approach someone and justIfy my race to them?</v>

6141
02:36:16.361 --> 02:36:17.081
<v Speaker 3>That terrifies me.</v>

6142
02:36:17.081 --> 02:36:17.914
<v Speaker 3>It really does,</v>

6143
02:36:17.950 --> 02:36:18.411
<v Speaker 3>and we will.</v>

6144
02:36:18.411 --> 02:36:20.830
<v Speaker 3>We see kirsten gillibrand tweet the future as intersectional.</v>

6145
02:36:21.550 --> 02:36:25.450
<v Speaker 3>Intersectionality is that ideology of race based polIcy.</v>

6146
02:36:25.870 --> 02:36:27.340
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] has put forth,</v>

6147
02:36:27.460 --> 02:36:27.760
<v Speaker 3>puts,</v>

6148
02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:29.860
<v Speaker 3>puts forth the green new deal that says racial equity.</v>

6149
02:36:31.290 --> 02:36:31.870
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6150
02:36:31.870 --> 02:36:33.970
<v Speaker 3>I prefer to judge someone on the content of their character,</v>

6151
02:36:33.971 --> 02:36:34.870
<v Speaker 3>not the color of their skin.</v>

6152
02:36:35.210 --> 02:36:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6153
02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:35.891
<v Speaker 3>it's also,</v>

6154
02:36:35.891 --> 02:36:37.900
<v Speaker 3>that's the kind of talk that gets trump reluctant.</v>

6155
02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:39.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh god.</v>

6156
02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:40.060
<v Speaker 3>And that's that one.</v>

6157
02:36:40.110 --> 02:36:41.920
<v Speaker 3>That's one of my biggest pet peeves because,</v>

6158
02:36:42.090 --> 02:36:42.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6159
02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:43.750
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about progressive tax.</v>

6160
02:36:43.810 --> 02:36:47.860
<v Speaker 3>I think we can do a lot for a public option for expanding medicaid.</v>

6161
02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:48.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6162
02:36:48.460 --> 02:36:48.730
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

6163
02:36:48.730 --> 02:36:51.430
<v Speaker 3>the idea of a green new deal at its core to me is fascinating.</v>

6164
02:36:51.730 --> 02:36:51.970
<v Speaker 3>Can,</v>

6165
02:36:51.970 --> 02:36:52.803
<v Speaker 3>can the government,</v>

6166
02:36:52.810 --> 02:36:53.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6167
02:36:53.081 --> 02:36:56.020
<v Speaker 3>can we allocate tax money to invest in new technologies,</v>

6168
02:36:56.021 --> 02:36:59.830
<v Speaker 3>fusion nuclear and reduce carbon emissions and do great things.</v>

6169
02:37:00.010 --> 02:37:01.240
<v Speaker 3>Can we make high speed rails?</v>

6170
02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:02.770
<v Speaker 3>But then when you come out and say,</v>

6171
02:37:02.780 --> 02:37:06.220
<v Speaker 3>pay the unwilling and these other equity things in intersectionality,</v>

6172
02:37:06.221 --> 02:37:06.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

6173
02:37:06.690 --> 02:37:07.120
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>

6174
02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:08.050
<v Speaker 3>that's not what I'm talking about.</v>

6175
02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:09.280
<v Speaker 3>I can't support that.</v>

6176
02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:11.680
<v Speaker 3>The unwilling is the most preposterous one.</v>

6177
02:37:11.890 --> 02:37:14.770
<v Speaker 3>The idea that someone's unwilling to work and we need to provide them with a</v>

6178
02:37:14.771 --> 02:37:15.604
<v Speaker 3>living.</v>

6179
02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:16.520
<v Speaker 3>That's insanity.</v>

6180
02:37:16.521 --> 02:37:16.701
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6181
02:37:16.701 --> 02:37:18.470
<v Speaker 3>that's the ultimate progressive bend,</v>

6182
02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:20.300
<v Speaker 3>but in that's where it keeps going,</v>

6183
02:37:20.301 --> 02:37:22.670
<v Speaker 3>but where they're trying to out progressive the next concept,</v>

6184
02:37:22.671 --> 02:37:22.860
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

6185
02:37:22.860 --> 02:37:25.880
<v Speaker 3>but hold on in a socialist or communist society stuff to work.</v>

6186
02:37:25.990 --> 02:37:26.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6187
02:37:26.420 --> 02:37:30.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what society exists where you expect people to undertake the</v>

6188
02:37:30.651 --> 02:37:33.230
<v Speaker 3>greatest construction project in the history of humanity,</v>

6189
02:37:33.530 --> 02:37:36.320
<v Speaker 3>a massive train network that makes all planes obsolete,</v>

6190
02:37:36.321 --> 02:37:38.390
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time tell people they don't have to work if they want money.</v>

6191
02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:39.171
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6192
02:37:39.171 --> 02:37:40.610
<v Speaker 3>this is what we're saying is like,</v>

6193
02:37:41.090 --> 02:37:45.710
<v Speaker 3>as these ideologies get more and more ridiculous,</v>

6194
02:37:45.950 --> 02:37:48.500
<v Speaker 3>they try to out progressive the next step,</v>

6195
02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:51.320
<v Speaker 3>like it's a fundamental right for you to earn a living.</v>

6196
02:37:51.460 --> 02:37:51.700
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

6197
02:37:51.700 --> 02:37:54.530
<v Speaker 3>and pew pew research recently put out a poll last week,</v>

6198
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:55.383
<v Speaker 3>couple weeks ago,</v>

6199
02:37:55.430 --> 02:37:55.911
<v Speaker 3>democrat,</v>

6200
02:37:55.911 --> 02:37:56.691
<v Speaker 3>the democratic party,</v>

6201
02:37:56.691 --> 02:37:58.730
<v Speaker 3>54 percent want more moderate policies.</v>

6202
02:37:59.300 --> 02:37:59.821
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>

6203
02:37:59.821 --> 02:38:00.654
<v Speaker 3>I fall in that bracket,</v>

6204
02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:01.371
<v Speaker 3>but still,</v>

6205
02:38:01.371 --> 02:38:04.520
<v Speaker 3>you still have about 43 or so that want more left leaning policies.</v>

6206
02:38:04.540 --> 02:38:05.870
<v Speaker 3>But what that means is the party split.</v>

6207
02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:06.670
<v Speaker 3>And so here,</v>

6208
02:38:06.670 --> 02:38:07.221
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem.</v>

6209
02:38:07.221 --> 02:38:08.054
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

6210
02:38:08.330 --> 02:38:09.410
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to put me up,</v>

6211
02:38:09.610 --> 02:38:09.930
<v Speaker 3>if you're gonna,</v>

6212
02:38:09.930 --> 02:38:10.041
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

6213
02:38:10.041 --> 02:38:10.191
<v Speaker 3>tim,</v>

6214
02:38:10.191 --> 02:38:10.940
<v Speaker 3>you got to vote,</v>

6215
02:38:10.940 --> 02:38:11.600
<v Speaker 3>you have to vote,</v>

6216
02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:12.470
<v Speaker 3>you have to make a choice.</v>

6217
02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:15.650
<v Speaker 3>You've got a moderate conservative who believes things I really don't agree</v>

6218
02:38:15.651 --> 02:38:16.100
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

6219
02:38:16.100 --> 02:38:18.890
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't want to give money to people that don't work and he doesn't</v>

6220
02:38:18.891 --> 02:38:21.680
<v Speaker 3>believe in identitarian politics and race equity or whatever.</v>

6221
02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:24.290
<v Speaker 3>And then you've got the democrats who are so far left to me,</v>

6222
02:38:24.291 --> 02:38:25.430
<v Speaker 3>I can't even see them anymore.</v>

6223
02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:26.553
<v Speaker 3>Who do you think,</v>

6224
02:38:26.570 --> 02:38:27.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6225
02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:32.000
<v Speaker 3>a social liberals and liberals are gonna vote for the closest person to them</v>

6226
02:38:32.001 --> 02:38:33.410
<v Speaker 3>politically will be a conservative.</v>

6227
02:38:33.610 --> 02:38:34.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6228
02:38:34.430 --> 02:38:35.300
<v Speaker 3>that's what scares me.</v>

6229
02:38:35.810 --> 02:38:36.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6230
02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:39.680
<v Speaker 3>we had this great future with a potential for a public option for expanding</v>

6231
02:38:39.681 --> 02:38:41.030
<v Speaker 3>medicaid for.</v>

6232
02:38:41.090 --> 02:38:41.451
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6233
02:38:41.451 --> 02:38:41.691
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

6234
02:38:41.691 --> 02:38:41.901
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6235
02:38:41.901 --> 02:38:44.060
<v Speaker 3>I really do believe social programs are important.</v>

6236
02:38:44.061 --> 02:38:44.894
<v Speaker 3>We can do more.</v>

6237
02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:46.610
<v Speaker 3>I like a lot of what bernie has to say.</v>

6238
02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:48.110
<v Speaker 3>I think we need to reform education,</v>

6239
02:38:48.111 --> 02:38:50.270
<v Speaker 3>but I think education could be expanded.</v>

6240
02:38:50.450 --> 02:38:50.811
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

6241
02:38:50.811 --> 02:38:51.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested in the ideas.</v>

6242
02:38:51.770 --> 02:38:52.850
<v Speaker 3>I want to advocate for them,</v>

6243
02:38:52.851 --> 02:38:53.870
<v Speaker 3>but we need to figure out how to do it.</v>

6244
02:38:54.380 --> 02:38:54.990
<v Speaker 3>But my po,</v>

6245
02:38:54.990 --> 02:38:56.750
<v Speaker 3>like where I fit politically,</v>

6246
02:38:56.751 --> 02:38:57.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm politically homeless.</v>

6247
02:38:58.220 --> 02:39:00.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with someone judging me based on my race.</v>

6248
02:39:00.590 --> 02:39:01.423
<v Speaker 3>I've been through that.</v>

6249
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:02.210
<v Speaker 3>Hell no.</v>

6250
02:39:02.210 --> 02:39:03.043
<v Speaker 3>Never again.</v>

6251
02:39:03.140 --> 02:39:05.840
<v Speaker 3>People vandalizing my home because they didn't like that at a brown mom and a</v>

6252
02:39:05.841 --> 02:39:06.440
<v Speaker 3>white dad.</v>

6253
02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:07.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to live in that world.</v>

6254
02:39:07.610 --> 02:39:09.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you to look me in the eyes and say,</v>

6255
02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:10.131
<v Speaker 3>I tell people,</v>

6256
02:39:10.131 --> 02:39:10.641
<v Speaker 3>look at this way.</v>

6257
02:39:10.641 --> 02:39:11.474
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to harvard,</v>

6258
02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:14.690
<v Speaker 3>I want you to look into the eyes of that little asian boy and say,</v>

6259
02:39:15.140 --> 02:39:15.830
<v Speaker 3>honey,</v>

6260
02:39:15.830 --> 02:39:16.910
<v Speaker 3>you can't go to harvard.</v>

6261
02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:17.953
<v Speaker 3>You're asian.</v>

6262
02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:19.700
<v Speaker 3>You look too much like those people.</v>

6263
02:39:19.940 --> 02:39:20.780
<v Speaker 3>How does that make sense?</v>

6264
02:39:21.020 --> 02:39:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Why is it that just because this kid looks similar to this kid,</v>

6265
02:39:24.740 --> 02:39:26.870
<v Speaker 3>you're going to tell him he has a harder standard for pat,</v>

6266
02:39:26.900 --> 02:39:28.250
<v Speaker 3>for the sats to get into the school.</v>

6267
02:39:28.850 --> 02:39:29.211
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

6268
02:39:29.211 --> 02:39:29.281
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6269
02:39:29.281 --> 02:39:29.990
<v Speaker 3>I refuse.</v>

6270
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.710
<v Speaker 3>I absolutely do.</v>

6271
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:31.431
<v Speaker 3>It's disgusting.</v>

6272
02:39:31.431 --> 02:39:34.780
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that it's coming from harvard is so confusing that the high.</v>

6273
02:39:34.781 --> 02:39:37.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is the school,</v>

6274
02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:37.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6275
02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:37.880
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>

6276
02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:39.560
<v Speaker 3>when you think about higher learning,</v>

6277
02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:40.350
<v Speaker 3>where'd you grow up?</v>

6278
02:39:40.350 --> 02:39:41.660
<v Speaker 3>Where my dad graduated from harvard.</v>

6279
02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6280
02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:43.160
<v Speaker 3>harvard,</v>

6281
02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:43.700
<v Speaker 3>harvard.</v>

6282
02:39:43.700 --> 02:39:46.850
<v Speaker 3>That's the school and the fact that they're practicing this way,</v>

6283
02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:49.640
<v Speaker 3>they say it's because if they didn't do that,</v>

6284
02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:51.770
<v Speaker 3>the student body would be overwhelmingly asian,</v>

6285
02:39:51.860 --> 02:39:53.960
<v Speaker 3>disproportionate to the ketchup white people.</v>

6286
02:39:54.110 --> 02:39:54.943
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

6287
02:39:55.130 --> 02:39:55.350
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6288
02:39:55.350 --> 02:39:56.183
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6289
02:39:56.760 --> 02:39:59.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you get to look at someone and say you look too much.</v>

6290
02:39:59.301 --> 02:40:00.200
<v Speaker 3>Like they do know.</v>

6291
02:40:00.201 --> 02:40:00.830
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

6292
02:40:00.830 --> 02:40:01.420
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

6293
02:40:01.420 --> 02:40:02.930
<v Speaker 3>it's not a meritocracy.</v>

6294
02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:03.940
<v Speaker 3>If you do that,</v>

6295
02:40:03.940 --> 02:40:04.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6296
02:40:04.700 --> 02:40:06.470
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk to you about the universal basic income.</v>

6297
02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:07.333
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about,</v>

6298
02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:11.300
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence and</v>

6299
02:40:11.301 --> 02:40:14.790
<v Speaker 3>automation and the removal of all these jobs is a real concern that a lot of</v>

6300
02:40:14.791 --> 02:40:15.624
<v Speaker 3>people have.</v>

6301
02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:20.780
<v Speaker 3>And then the way to mitigate it that's being bandied about is universal basic</v>

6302
02:40:21.331 --> 02:40:25.690
<v Speaker 3>income that they would give you a certain amount of money and I think the idea</v>

6303
02:40:25.691 --> 02:40:26.910
<v Speaker 3>is that everyone would get it.</v>

6304
02:40:27.180 --> 02:40:28.560
<v Speaker 3>Even wealthy people would get it.</v>

6305
02:40:28.660 --> 02:40:29.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6306
02:40:29.010 --> 02:40:31.140
<v Speaker 3>And that would be the only way to make it fair,</v>

6307
02:40:31.141 --> 02:40:33.030
<v Speaker 3>but where the fuck is that money coming from?</v>

6308
02:40:33.060 --> 02:40:34.680
<v Speaker 3>And then what do you think about it?</v>

6309
02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:35.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

6310
02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:36.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm not an economiSt man,</v>

6311
02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:37.671
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>

6312
02:40:37.671 --> 02:40:38.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's feasible,</v>

6313
02:40:38.611 --> 02:40:39.450
<v Speaker 3>at least right now,</v>

6314
02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:44.010
<v Speaker 3>I do believe that on a technological level we will eventually reach like a star</v>

6315
02:40:44.011 --> 02:40:48.120
<v Speaker 3>trek kind of future where it's not about communism,</v>

6316
02:40:48.121 --> 02:40:50.940
<v Speaker 3>it's just literally like we have no scarcity is gone.</v>

6317
02:40:51.420 --> 02:40:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Like they have replicators,</v>

6318
02:40:52.710 --> 02:40:54.090
<v Speaker 3>but when it comes to universal basic income,</v>

6319
02:40:54.091 --> 02:40:56.190
<v Speaker 3>people need to understand some basic economic principles.</v>

6320
02:40:56.970 --> 02:40:58.740
<v Speaker 3>If everybody gets a thousand dollars,</v>

6321
02:40:58.890 --> 02:40:59.723
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

6322
02:40:59.790 --> 02:41:00.890
<v Speaker 3>that's $300,</v>

6323
02:41:00.891 --> 02:41:02.100
<v Speaker 3>million thousand dollars.</v>

6324
02:41:02.150 --> 02:41:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

6325
02:41:02.460 --> 02:41:02.790
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6326
02:41:02.790 --> 02:41:03.601
<v Speaker 3>But it's not everybody.</v>

6327
02:41:03.601 --> 02:41:04.980
<v Speaker 3>It's everybody of working age,</v>

6328
02:41:04.981 --> 02:41:05.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6329
02:41:05.460 --> 02:41:06.060
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

6330
02:41:06.060 --> 02:41:06.391
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

6331
02:41:06.391 --> 02:41:06.960
<v Speaker 3>so let's,</v>

6332
02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:07.530
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

6333
02:41:07.530 --> 02:41:08.260
<v Speaker 3>let's do this.</v>

6334
02:41:08.260 --> 02:41:09.570
<v Speaker 3>I own a,</v>

6335
02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:10.433
<v Speaker 3>I own a burger shop.</v>

6336
02:41:10.980 --> 02:41:12.630
<v Speaker 3>I need to hire someone to flip burgers.</v>

6337
02:41:13.050 --> 02:41:14.730
<v Speaker 3>So I say we pay 10 bucks an hour.</v>

6338
02:41:14.850 --> 02:41:15.301
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

6339
02:41:15.301 --> 02:41:15.600
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

6340
02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:16.021
<v Speaker 3>it's not a lot,</v>

6341
02:41:16.021 --> 02:41:16.801
<v Speaker 3>but we're a small business.</v>

6342
02:41:16.801 --> 02:41:17.790
<v Speaker 3>We can't really afford to pay more.</v>

6343
02:41:17.791 --> 02:41:18.331
<v Speaker 3>Is that acceptable?</v>

6344
02:41:18.331 --> 02:41:20.580
<v Speaker 3>They say I get a thousand bucks a month.</v>

6345
02:41:20.581 --> 02:41:20.911
<v Speaker 3>Why would I,</v>

6346
02:41:20.911 --> 02:41:21.540
<v Speaker 3>why would I spend,</v>

6347
02:41:21.540 --> 02:41:22.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6348
02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:22.500
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

6349
02:41:22.500 --> 02:41:26.310
<v Speaker 3>if you know that not really well the is that the thousand bucks a month that you</v>

6350
02:41:26.311 --> 02:41:26.790
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>

6351
02:41:26.790 --> 02:41:29.670
<v Speaker 3>you get to keep and then the time is worth more than 10 bucks an hour.</v>

6352
02:41:30.510 --> 02:41:31.343
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what,</v>

6353
02:41:31.490 --> 02:41:31.980
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>

6354
02:41:31.980 --> 02:41:32.761
<v Speaker 3>when I was 17,</v>

6355
02:41:32.761 --> 02:41:33.540
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>

6356
02:41:33.540 --> 02:41:35.490
<v Speaker 3>I worked for american eagle airlines.</v>

6357
02:41:35.790 --> 02:41:39.030
<v Speaker 3>I was lifting like 50,000 pounds per day and I was getting 10 bucks an hour and</v>

6358
02:41:39.110 --> 02:41:39.943
<v Speaker 3>in jacked.</v>

6359
02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:40.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6360
02:41:40.860 --> 02:41:41.300
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

6361
02:41:41.300 --> 02:41:42.510
<v Speaker 3>I've been skateboarding my whole life,</v>

6362
02:41:42.511 --> 02:41:43.680
<v Speaker 3>so I was certainly,</v>

6363
02:41:43.710 --> 02:41:43.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6364
02:41:43.921 --> 02:41:44.670
<v Speaker 3>in shape.</v>

6365
02:41:44.670 --> 02:41:45.210
<v Speaker 3>But if you gave,</v>

6366
02:41:45.210 --> 02:41:45.990
<v Speaker 3>if you told me,</v>

6367
02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:46.320
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

6368
02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:48.790
<v Speaker 3>you know how you're making less than a thousand bucks a month working fulltime</v>

6369
02:41:48.840 --> 02:41:49.590
<v Speaker 3>after taxes,</v>

6370
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:50.730
<v Speaker 3>how about we just give you a thousand bucks?</v>

6371
02:41:50.731 --> 02:41:52.590
<v Speaker 3>I bet I'll be the skatepark yeah,</v>

6372
02:41:52.750 --> 02:41:52.990
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

6373
02:41:52.990 --> 02:41:53.370
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

6374
02:41:53.370 --> 02:41:53.551
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

6375
02:41:53.551 --> 02:41:56.010
<v Speaker 3>So there's some positives that people will pursue their passions,</v>

6376
02:41:56.011 --> 02:41:56.844
<v Speaker 3>but hold on.</v>

6377
02:41:57.030 --> 02:41:58.830
<v Speaker 3>How many people do you know want to be comedians?</v>

6378
02:41:58.831 --> 02:41:59.664
<v Speaker 3>And they're not funny.</v>

6379
02:42:00.110 --> 02:42:00.840
<v Speaker 3>A few.</v>

6380
02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:01.261
<v Speaker 3>Quite a few.</v>

6381
02:42:01.261 --> 02:42:03.990
<v Speaker 3>And imagine if you said we're going to subsidize your endeavor into a thing.</v>

6382
02:42:03.991 --> 02:42:07.320
<v Speaker 3>You're not good at how many People are really good at being carpenters,</v>

6383
02:42:07.321 --> 02:42:08.760
<v Speaker 3>but they wished they'd be pro football players.</v>

6384
02:42:09.060 --> 02:42:12.030
<v Speaker 3>How many people are really good at being teachers but want to be a famous actor?</v>

6385
02:42:12.420 --> 02:42:16.740
<v Speaker 3>So what do you think would be some sort of an appropriate response to automation</v>

6386
02:42:16.741 --> 02:42:18.750
<v Speaker 3>and artificial intelligence?</v>

6387
02:42:18.780 --> 02:42:18.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6388
02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:21.980
<v Speaker 3>you can't just have millions and millions of people just have nowhere to,</v>

6389
02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:22.590
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

6390
02:42:22.590 --> 02:42:23.220
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

6391
02:42:23.220 --> 02:42:24.053
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

6392
02:42:24.110 --> 02:42:24.640
<v Speaker 3>a technical,</v>

6393
02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:25.473
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

6394
02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:27.640
<v Speaker 3>This is why I uh,</v>

6395
02:42:27.750 --> 02:42:27.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6396
02:42:27.950 --> 02:42:28.261
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

6397
02:42:28.261 --> 02:42:29.820
<v Speaker 3>I've never been a pot sMoker.</v>

6398
02:42:30.210 --> 02:42:30.660
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6399
02:42:30.660 --> 02:42:31.800
<v Speaker 3>I smoked like once in my life.</v>

6400
02:42:31.820 --> 02:42:32.220
<v Speaker 3>I want to try.</v>

6401
02:42:32.220 --> 02:42:32.640
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6402
02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:33.473
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6403
02:42:33.690 --> 02:42:34.523
<v Speaker 3>it's just not my thing,</v>

6404
02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:37.590
<v Speaker 3>but everyone always would think I was stoned because I would talk about this</v>

6405
02:42:37.591 --> 02:42:39.300
<v Speaker 3>kind of stuff with my friends while they were stoned.</v>

6406
02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:42.000
<v Speaker 3>The philosophical consequences of technological innovation.</v>

6407
02:42:42.780 --> 02:42:46.830
<v Speaker 3>It is not the postMaster's fault that he spent 30 years becoming the best of the</v>

6408
02:42:46.831 --> 02:42:48.390
<v Speaker 3>best in working at the post office.</v>

6409
02:42:48.750 --> 02:42:52.290
<v Speaker 3>That technology emerged that is going to displace him and make him put them in</v>

6410
02:42:52.291 --> 02:42:52.860
<v Speaker 3>the poor house.</v>

6411
02:42:52.860 --> 02:42:53.340
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6412
02:42:53.340 --> 02:42:54.780
<v Speaker 3>When I was about 19 years old,</v>

6413
02:42:54.781 --> 02:42:58.710
<v Speaker 3>I was skateboarding in downtown chicago and I saw an old black homeless man and</v>

6414
02:42:58.711 --> 02:43:00.270
<v Speaker 3>I had some leftover food and I was like,</v>

6415
02:43:00.271 --> 02:43:00.421
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

6416
02:43:00.421 --> 02:43:01.254
<v Speaker 3>what's up dude?</v>

6417
02:43:01.260 --> 02:43:01.831
<v Speaker 3>You want some food?</v>

6418
02:43:01.831 --> 02:43:02.140
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

6419
02:43:02.140 --> 02:43:03.120
<v Speaker 3>oh thanks man.</v>

6420
02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:04.500
<v Speaker 3>And I was just like,</v>

6421
02:43:04.740 --> 02:43:05.371
<v Speaker 3>I got to know,</v>

6422
02:43:05.371 --> 02:43:06.300

<v Speaker 3>how did you become homeless?</v>

6424
02:43:08.250 --> 02:43:09.083
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

6425
02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:09.840

02:43:11.020 --> 02:43:12.220
<v Speaker 3>I think he was like 60 something.</v>

6430
02:43:12.250 --> 02:43:13.540
<v Speaker 3>He said I used to have a job.</v>

6431
02:43:13.810 --> 02:43:14.170
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6432
02:43:14.170 --> 02:43:15.080
<v Speaker 3>I worked all day day.</v>

6433
02:43:15.081 --> 02:43:15.914
<v Speaker 3>I had a family.</v>

6434
02:43:16.410 --> 02:43:16.751
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6435
02:43:16.751 --> 02:43:17.531
<v Speaker 3>eventually,</v>

6436
02:43:17.531 --> 02:43:17.941
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6437
02:43:17.941 --> 02:43:18.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6438
02:43:18.430 --> 02:43:18.700
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

6439
02:43:18.700 --> 02:43:19.031
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

6440
02:43:19.031 --> 02:43:19.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6441
02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:20.410
<v Speaker 3>didn't have kids.</v>

6442
02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:22.630
<v Speaker 3>My friends started getting old and move on.</v>

6443
02:43:22.631 --> 02:43:23.411
<v Speaker 3>I lost touch with a lot of them.</v>

6444
02:43:23.411 --> 02:43:28.411
<v Speaker 3>Some of them died and one day I got told that my job wasn't needed anymore and</v>

6445
02:43:28.571 --> 02:43:29.830
<v Speaker 3>so I could know anything.</v>

6446
02:43:29.950 --> 02:43:31.210
<v Speaker 3>Went on unemployment for a little bit.</v>

6447
02:43:31.390 --> 02:43:32.230
<v Speaker 3>But my,</v>

6448
02:43:32.260 --> 02:43:32.531
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6449
02:43:32.531 --> 02:43:33.550
<v Speaker 3>the job I was good at,</v>

6450
02:43:33.610 --> 02:43:34.480
<v Speaker 3>it didn't exist.</v>

6451
02:43:34.540 --> 02:43:34.841
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6452
02:43:34.841 --> 02:43:35.710
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember exactly what he said.</v>

6453
02:43:35.711 --> 02:43:36.910
<v Speaker 3>There's this 14 years ago,</v>

6454
02:43:37.330 --> 02:43:38.021
<v Speaker 3>but he was like,</v>

6455
02:43:38.021 --> 02:43:39.070
<v Speaker 3>so everywhere I went,</v>

6456
02:43:39.071 --> 02:43:39.600
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

6457
02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:40.390
<v Speaker 3>I'll do anything,</v>

6458
02:43:40.390 --> 02:43:41.223
<v Speaker 3>I'll do anything.</v>

6459
02:43:41.410 --> 02:43:44.590
<v Speaker 3>But even the small jobs that paid a little bit to flip burgers weren't enough to</v>

6460
02:43:44.591 --> 02:43:45.424
<v Speaker 3>cover mY rent.</v>

6461
02:43:45.790 --> 02:43:49.870
<v Speaker 3>After a few months I got evicted then because I didn't have a place to live,</v>

6462
02:43:49.871 --> 02:43:50.561
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't go to the job.</v>

6463
02:43:50.561 --> 02:43:52.180
<v Speaker 3>I did have started sleeping outside.</v>

6464
02:43:52.181 --> 02:43:53.020
<v Speaker 3>And I've been here ever since.</v>

6465
02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:54.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

6466
02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:54.933
<v Speaker 3>that said,</v>

6467
02:43:55.180 --> 02:43:55.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6468
02:43:55.660 --> 02:43:56.051
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

6469
02:43:56.051 --> 02:43:56.350
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

6470
02:43:56.350 --> 02:43:57.250
<v Speaker 3>that's a sad reality.</v>

6471
02:43:57.251 --> 02:43:58.084
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>

6472
02:43:58.120 --> 02:43:59.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't know doc,</v>

6473
02:43:59.770 --> 02:44:00.670
<v Speaker 3>but your hooks you up.</v>

6474
02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:01.420
<v Speaker 3>But that's the thing.</v>

6475
02:44:01.420 --> 02:44:02.051
<v Speaker 3>She goes too far.</v>

6476
02:44:02.051 --> 02:44:05.980
<v Speaker 3>But this is why I believe in some kind of social policy and safety net,</v>

6477
02:44:05.981 --> 02:44:06.701
<v Speaker 3>social security,</v>

6478
02:44:06.701 --> 02:44:07.810
<v Speaker 3>something to help these people.</v>

6479
02:44:08.020 --> 02:44:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Well for sure.</v>

6480
02:44:09.340 --> 02:44:09.701
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6481
02:44:09.701 --> 02:44:11.410
<v Speaker 3>if we have a real community,</v>

6482
02:44:11.500 --> 02:44:14.130
<v Speaker 3>you would help out the people that are in your community too big.</v>

6483
02:44:14.470 --> 02:44:14.860
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

6484
02:44:14.860 --> 02:44:15.180
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

6485
02:44:15.180 --> 02:44:15.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6486
02:44:15.550 --> 02:44:15.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6487
02:44:15.760 --> 02:44:16.750
<v Speaker 3>communism works really,</v>

6488
02:44:16.751 --> 02:44:18.160
<v Speaker 3>really well when you have like five people.</v>

6489
02:44:18.650 --> 02:44:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6490
02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:21.580
<v Speaker 3>I try explaining to people they always make this political,</v>

6491
02:44:21.870 --> 02:44:22.750
<v Speaker 3>the political compass.</v>

6492
02:44:22.810 --> 02:44:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Authoritarian lIbertarian left,</v>

6493
02:44:23.891 --> 02:44:24.724
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6494
02:44:24.790 --> 02:44:25.270
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

6495
02:44:25.270 --> 02:44:25.600
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

6496
02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:28.720
<v Speaker 3>People like to claim that anarchists like the violent smashy ones,</v>

6497
02:44:28.721 --> 02:44:30.610
<v Speaker 3>an antifa are libertarian left.</v>

6498
02:44:30.611 --> 02:44:30.920
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

6499
02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:31.041
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6500
02:44:31.041 --> 02:44:31.101
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6501
02:44:31.101 --> 02:44:31.181
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6502
02:44:31.181 --> 02:44:31.990
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

6503
02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:35.170
<v Speaker 3>Like the libertarian left quadrant are pot smoking,</v>

6504
02:44:35.171 --> 02:44:38.770
<v Speaker 3>hippies live on farms and arco communism makes a ton of sense.</v>

6505
02:44:38.771 --> 02:44:41.560
<v Speaker 3>when it's you and your buddies working together on a farm sharing</v>

6506
02:44:41.561 --> 02:44:42.430
<v Speaker 3>responsibilities.</v>

6507
02:44:42.670 --> 02:44:46.690
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make sense for a community of 300 million people and you have to</v>

6508
02:44:46.691 --> 02:44:50.770
<v Speaker 3>trade extremely specific resources to make a computer happen.</v>

6509
02:44:51.130 --> 02:44:51.490
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

6510
02:44:51.490 --> 02:44:52.001
<v Speaker 3>At that point,</v>

6511
02:44:52.001 --> 02:44:54.700
<v Speaker 3>do you need to be able to quantify the value of Specific objects?</v>

6512
02:44:54.701 --> 02:44:56.840
<v Speaker 3>And that's why communism doesn't work for massive,</v>

6513
02:44:57.080 --> 02:44:57.913
<v Speaker 3>massive scale,</v>

6514
02:44:58.360 --> 02:44:59.193
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

6515
02:45:00.310 --> 02:45:03.020
<v Speaker 3>I will say when a artificial intelligence,</v>

6516
02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:03.910
<v Speaker 3>a different conversation,</v>

6517
02:45:03.970 --> 02:45:04.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6518
02:45:04.211 --> 02:45:05.060
<v Speaker 3>technological advancements,</v>

6519
02:45:05.140 --> 02:45:07.660
<v Speaker 3>advancement is going to result in like luddite riots.</v>

6520
02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:08.231
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6521
02:45:08.231 --> 02:45:08.510
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

6522
02:45:08.510 --> 02:45:08.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6523
02:45:08.770 --> 02:45:09.820
<v Speaker 3>the opioid crisis.</v>

6524
02:45:10.230 --> 02:45:10.450
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6525
02:45:10.450 --> 02:45:11.231
<v Speaker 3>I could be wrong.</v>

6526
02:45:11.231 --> 02:45:14.920
<v Speaker 3>I read that there was a connection between unemployment from these factories</v>

6527
02:45:14.921 --> 02:45:17.800
<v Speaker 3>getting shut down and depressed dudes popping pills.</v>

6528
02:45:18.370 --> 02:45:19.030
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

6529
02:45:19.030 --> 02:45:23.410
<v Speaker 3>a masculinity report was published by harry's shaving company and they said the</v>

6530
02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:27.490
<v Speaker 3>over the overwhelming majority of what contributes to a man's happiness as</v>

6531
02:45:27.491 --> 02:45:28.360
<v Speaker 3>gainful employment,</v>

6532
02:45:28.540 --> 02:45:28.890
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

6533
02:45:28.890 --> 02:45:29.830
<v Speaker 3>like 80 percent.</v>

6534
02:45:30.610 --> 02:45:32.260
<v Speaker 3>So what happens when a factory shuts down?</v>

6535
02:45:32.500 --> 02:45:34.810
<v Speaker 3>You got a bunch of young dudes who wanted to do something.</v>

6536
02:45:34.811 --> 02:45:35.644
<v Speaker 3>they want to matter,</v>

6537
02:45:36.100 --> 02:45:36.581
<v Speaker 3>but they can't.</v>

6538
02:45:36.581 --> 02:45:37.150
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

6539
02:45:37.150 --> 02:45:37.990
<v Speaker 3>there's no where to go anymore,</v>

6540
02:45:37.991 --> 02:45:39.190
<v Speaker 3>especially in a small town.</v>

6541
02:45:39.220 --> 02:45:39.851
<v Speaker 3>But I'll tell you what,</v>

6542
02:45:39.851 --> 02:45:41.770
<v Speaker 3>men percosets feel real good.</v>

6543
02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:42.551
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6544
02:45:42.551 --> 02:45:43.031
<v Speaker 3>those drugs,</v>

6545
02:45:43.031 --> 02:45:43.870
<v Speaker 3>they feel fantastic,</v>

6546
02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:44.793
<v Speaker 3>but they'll kill you.</v>

6547
02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:46.480
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

6548
02:45:46.481 --> 02:45:46.661
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6549
02:45:46.661 --> 02:45:49.420
<v Speaker 3>I think this contributes to the popularity of bernie sanders and trump.</v>

6550
02:45:49.870 --> 02:45:51.070
<v Speaker 3>They talked about the working class.</v>

6551
02:45:51.071 --> 02:45:52.180
<v Speaker 3>I talked about these free trade agreements,</v>

6552
02:45:52.181 --> 02:45:52.721
<v Speaker 3>hurting people.</v>

6553
02:45:52.721 --> 02:45:55.690
<v Speaker 3>they talked about gettIng the factories back together and that means a lot to</v>

6554
02:45:55.691 --> 02:45:58.660
<v Speaker 3>people who have been popping pills who are depressed,</v>

6555
02:45:58.661 --> 02:46:01.330
<v Speaker 3>who are sad and scared and so a lot of people in this country.</v>

6556
02:46:01.780 --> 02:46:02.770
<v Speaker 3>So to wrap this up,</v>

6557
02:46:03.010 --> 02:46:04.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm the only.</v>

6558
02:46:05.290 --> 02:46:06.670
<v Speaker 3>The only other thing that I think</v>

6559
02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:11.120
<v Speaker 3>I would like to at least make</v>

6560
02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:16.120
<v Speaker 2>an attempt at is what would be the path for a person who's been banned from</v>

6561
02:46:17.211 --> 02:46:18.440
<v Speaker 2>these social media sites?</v>

6562
02:46:18.460 --> 02:46:18.770
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

6563
02:46:18.770 --> 02:46:23.510
<v Speaker 2>what do you think would be a reasonable way to bring people back into the</v>

6564
02:46:23.511 --> 02:46:24.344
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

6565
02:46:26.210 --> 02:46:28.010
<v Speaker 2>whether it's youtube or whatever.</v>

6566
02:46:28.370 --> 02:46:31.280
<v Speaker 2>What would be a reasonable way mean?</v>

6567
02:46:31.281 --> 02:46:32.114
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think?</v>

6568
02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:33.190
<v Speaker 2>Just shouldn't be in a bag.</v>

6569
02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Honest,</v>

6570
02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:34.383
<v Speaker 2>reinstate it.</v>

6571
02:46:34.410 --> 02:46:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Just anybody,</v>

6572
02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:35.961
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>

6573
02:46:35.961 --> 02:46:36.980
<v Speaker 2>No matter what they've done.</v>

6574
02:46:37.280 --> 02:46:38.030
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6575
02:46:38.030 --> 02:46:38.990
<v Speaker 2>if you commit a crime,</v>

6576
02:46:39.070 --> 02:46:39.903
<v Speaker 2>you got to,</v>

6577
02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:40.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6578
02:46:40.281 --> 02:46:40.701
<v Speaker 2>you get caught,</v>

6579
02:46:40.701 --> 02:46:41.360
<v Speaker 2>you go to jail,</v>

6580
02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:41.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6581
02:46:41.870 --> 02:46:42.621
<v Speaker 2>Then when you get out,</v>

6582
02:46:42.621 --> 02:46:44.060
<v Speaker 2>you're free to engage in normal,</v>

6583
02:46:44.170 --> 02:46:44.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6584
02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:45.740
<v Speaker 2>civic behavior.</v>

6585
02:46:45.860 --> 02:46:50.860
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that the concept of a permanent ban is in some way almost an</v>

6586
02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:53.780
<v Speaker 2>american concept?</v>

6587
02:46:54.580 --> 02:46:55.131
<v Speaker 2>Oh man.</v>

6588
02:46:55.131 --> 02:46:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6589
02:46:55.640 --> 02:46:56.690
<v Speaker 2>To get that specific,</v>

6590
02:46:56.750 --> 02:46:58.250
<v Speaker 2>like while we're into freedom of speech,</v>

6591
02:46:58.270 --> 02:46:59.103
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

6592
02:46:59.390 --> 02:47:04.390
<v Speaker 2>I believe that as long as these companies are monopolies and they are the public</v>

6593
02:47:04.611 --> 02:47:05.444
<v Speaker 2>sphere,</v>

6594
02:47:05.630 --> 02:47:09.620
<v Speaker 2>it is wrong to permanently exile someone for saying a bad word for holding the</v>

6595
02:47:09.621 --> 02:47:14.390
<v Speaker 2>wrong opinion will mean a lot of these like learn to code or they're fucking</v>

6596
02:47:14.391 --> 02:47:15.230
<v Speaker 2>preposterous.</v>

6597
02:47:15.230 --> 02:47:18.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean to ban someone permanently for something that well for saying a man is</v>

6598
02:47:18.711 --> 02:47:19.580
<v Speaker 2>never a woman.</v>

6599
02:47:19.650 --> 02:47:19.941
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6600
02:47:19.941 --> 02:47:20.840
<v Speaker 2>That was a permanent ban.</v>

6601
02:47:21.650 --> 02:47:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Men aren't women though.</v>

6602
02:47:23.010 --> 02:47:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6603
02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:23.690
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

6604
02:47:23.690 --> 02:47:25.340
<v Speaker 2>That's absurd and terrifying.</v>

6605
02:47:25.450 --> 02:47:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6606
02:47:25.970 --> 02:47:26.650
<v Speaker 2>but even.</v>

6607
02:47:26.650 --> 02:47:29.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm like milo being banned.</v>

6608
02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:29.661
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

6609
02:47:29.661 --> 02:47:29.901
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

6610
02:47:29.901 --> 02:47:31.370
<v Speaker 2>Because he was tweeting at a celebrity.</v>

6611
02:47:31.700 --> 02:47:32.540
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to tweet it.</v>

6612
02:47:32.550 --> 02:47:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Celebrities only that it was a.</v>

6613
02:47:34.220 --> 02:47:34.521
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6614
02:47:34.521 --> 02:47:39.380
<v Speaker 2>the criticism of that movie was no different than the criticism of any movie</v>

6615
02:47:39.381 --> 02:47:40.440
<v Speaker 2>that they thought sucked.</v>

6616
02:47:40.610 --> 02:47:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6617
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:43.910
<v Speaker 2>But it happened to be about a feminist idea or a woman's.</v>

6618
02:47:43.940 --> 02:47:44.780
<v Speaker 2>And what was,</v>

6619
02:47:44.781 --> 02:47:45.830
<v Speaker 2>what was interesting is that,</v>

6620
02:47:45.870 --> 02:47:46.131
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6621
02:47:46.131 --> 02:47:46.761
<v Speaker 2>it's been so long,</v>

6622
02:47:46.761 --> 02:47:47.900
<v Speaker 2>so forgive me if I get this wrong,</v>

6623
02:47:47.901 --> 02:47:51.740
<v Speaker 2>but I believe leslie jones was tweeting her followers to go to my low as well or</v>

6624
02:47:51.741 --> 02:47:52.820
<v Speaker 2>something that I believe so.</v>

6625
02:47:53.140 --> 02:47:53.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6626
02:47:53.680 --> 02:47:54.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6627
02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:54.501
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

6628
02:47:54.501 --> 02:47:55.220
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

6629
02:47:55.220 --> 02:47:56.210
<v Speaker 2>she's done some,</v>

6630
02:47:56.900 --> 02:47:58.760
<v Speaker 2>some questionable tweets herself.</v>

6631
02:47:58.790 --> 02:47:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Hey look,</v>

6632
02:47:59.270 --> 02:48:00.530
<v Speaker 2>people block me for no reason.</v>

6633
02:48:00.860 --> 02:48:01.101
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6634
02:48:01.101 --> 02:48:02.810
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea why some people have locked me.</v>

6635
02:48:02.870 --> 02:48:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6636
02:48:03.130 --> 02:48:06.380
<v Speaker 2>I've gone to people's pages and found that unblocked block lists.</v>

6637
02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6638
02:48:06.980 --> 02:48:07.131
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6639
02:48:07.131 --> 02:48:08.630
<v Speaker 2>there's a solution if you don't,</v>

6640
02:48:08.631 --> 02:48:09.320
<v Speaker 2>if you don't.</v>

6641
02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:10.070
<v Speaker 2>So what they say,</v>

6642
02:48:10.070 --> 02:48:10.880
<v Speaker 2>what they say is,</v>

6643
02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:11.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6644
02:48:11.690 --> 02:48:13.220
<v Speaker 2>it's actually really interesting precedent.</v>

6645
02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:16.080
<v Speaker 2>The daily stormer encouraged.</v>

6646
02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:18.200
<v Speaker 2>This is I'm going off of some news reports that could be wrong,</v>

6647
02:48:18.201 --> 02:48:19.940
<v Speaker 2>encouraged people to send,</v>

6648
02:48:19.970 --> 02:48:20.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6649
02:48:20.180 --> 02:48:24.500
<v Speaker 2>racist images and start sending mean thanks to this woman who I think,</v>

6650
02:48:24.570 --> 02:48:28.010
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was an asian or black and a court ruled that the first amendment</v>

6651
02:48:28.011 --> 02:48:31.370
<v Speaker 2>will not protect you if you encourage others to engage in harassment.</v>

6652
02:48:32.270 --> 02:48:33.051
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>

6653
02:48:33.051 --> 02:48:36.110
<v Speaker 2>Then when we cOnsider what's going to happen with the lawsuits towards all of</v>

6654
02:48:36.111 --> 02:48:39.620
<v Speaker 2>the people who smeared and defamed and called for action against the covington</v>

6655
02:48:39.621 --> 02:48:40.454
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

6656
02:48:40.460 --> 02:48:43.160
<v Speaker 2>that precedent that was used against daily stormer is not going to be used</v>

6657
02:48:43.161 --> 02:48:46.280
<v Speaker 2>against these high profile celebrities and personalities and are there lawsuits</v>

6658
02:48:46.281 --> 02:48:47.750
<v Speaker 2>that are being formed right now for that?</v>

6659
02:48:47.870 --> 02:48:48.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6660
02:48:48.081 --> 02:48:49.190
<v Speaker 2>The big news,</v>

6661
02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:51.230
<v Speaker 2>the five Lawyers,</v>

6662
02:48:51.231 --> 02:48:52.460
<v Speaker 2>I think I remember the guys name,</v>

6663
02:48:52.940 --> 02:48:54.280
<v Speaker 2>huge list to ethnography.</v>

6664
02:48:54.310 --> 02:48:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Use your list a lot of like,</v>

6665
02:48:57.130 --> 02:48:57.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6666
02:48:58.010 --> 02:49:00.020
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people did like their tweets,</v>

6667
02:49:00.590 --> 02:49:03.710
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people didn't retract like bill maher four days later.</v>

6668
02:49:03.711 --> 02:49:07.920
<v Speaker 2>It'S like after people are already offering to represent these and threatened</v>

6669
02:49:07.921 --> 02:49:08.250
<v Speaker 2>lawsuits,</v>

6670
02:49:08.250 --> 02:49:09.960
<v Speaker 3>bill maher then comes out with his bad information,</v>

6671
02:49:10.350 --> 02:49:10.771
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

6672
02:49:10.771 --> 02:49:12.660
<v Speaker 3>ultimately to the point of redemption,</v>

6673
02:49:13.350 --> 02:49:16.380
<v Speaker 3>we shouldn't permanently exile people for saying things that we think are wrong.</v>

6674
02:49:16.780 --> 02:49:18.840
<v Speaker 3>What really scares me about the Alex Jones thing.</v>

6675
02:49:19.290 --> 02:49:19.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

6676
02:49:19.770 --> 02:49:20.960
<v Speaker 3>What I'm about to say is not declined.</v>

6677
02:49:20.970 --> 02:49:23.040
<v Speaker 3>the Alex Jones is mentally deficient or anything like that.</v>

6678
02:49:23.041 --> 02:49:23.610
<v Speaker 3>That's not my.</v>

6679
02:49:23.610 --> 02:49:24.840
<v Speaker 3>That's not whatever you want.</v>

6680
02:49:24.841 --> 02:49:25.674
<v Speaker 3>The point is,</v>

6681
02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:29.040
<v Speaker 3>if your justification for banning him is that he said san diego wasn't real,</v>

6682
02:49:29.370 --> 02:49:33.990
<v Speaker 3>does that mean people who are who don't have a grasp on reality aren't allowed</v>

6683
02:49:33.991 --> 02:49:34.824
<v Speaker 3>to use social media?</v>

6684
02:49:34.980 --> 02:49:35.221
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

6685
02:49:35.221 --> 02:49:38.400
<v Speaker 3>does that mean that people who are stupid ontologic social media,</v>

6686
02:49:38.700 --> 02:49:42.270
<v Speaker 3>people who are mentally ill have to have an intelligence test to use social</v>

6687
02:49:42.271 --> 02:49:42.660
<v Speaker 3>media?</v>

6688
02:49:42.660 --> 02:49:43.493
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

6689
02:49:44.060 --> 02:49:47.970
<v Speaker 3>People are allowed to say what they want to say and I think so long as twitter</v>

6690
02:49:47.971 --> 02:49:48.804
<v Speaker 3>is a monopoly,</v>

6691
02:49:49.320 --> 02:49:50.340
<v Speaker 3>they should probably.</v>

6692
02:49:50.370 --> 02:49:54.030
<v Speaker 3>We should probably have some protections on the ability to engage in public</v>

6693
02:49:54.031 --> 02:49:54.720
<v Speaker 3>discourse.</v>

6694
02:49:54.720 --> 02:49:56.400
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a really imporTant point.</v>

6695
02:49:57.060 --> 02:50:00.900
<v Speaker 3>Occupy wall street took place in zucotti park in New York on what's called a</v>

6696
02:50:00.901 --> 02:50:03.050
<v Speaker 3>privately owned public space pops.</v>

6697
02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:05.580
<v Speaker 3>This space is owned by a private entity.</v>

6698
02:50:05.910 --> 02:50:06.600
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

6699
02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:09.960
<v Speaker 3>they had no legal grounds for evicting the protesters from the park because it</v>

6700
02:50:09.961 --> 02:50:10.794
<v Speaker 3>was encouraged.</v>

6701
02:50:10.980 --> 02:50:12.270
<v Speaker 3>The public was encouraged to come,</v>

6702
02:50:12.810 --> 02:50:16.230
<v Speaker 3>so I would argue if twitter has actively encouraging public participation,</v>

6703
02:50:16.260 --> 02:50:18.390
<v Speaker 3>they lose the protections to band whoever they want.</v>

6704
02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:22.980
<v Speaker 3>I think it's rather terrifying that you would seed political power in this</v>

6705
02:50:22.981 --> 02:50:24.780
<v Speaker 3>capacity to foreign interests.</v>

6706
02:50:24.781 --> 02:50:27.430
<v Speaker 3>Stockholders and private individuals at a massive corporation,</v>

6707
02:50:27.470 --> 02:50:27.710
<v Speaker 3>mr.</v>

6708
02:50:27.710 --> 02:50:28.543
<v Speaker 3>Monopoly,</v>

6709
02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:29.900
<v Speaker 3>that's not even beholden to the u.</v>

6710
02:50:29.901 --> 02:50:31.020
<v Speaker 3>S to a certain degree,</v>

6711
02:50:31.620 --> 02:50:32.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6712
02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:36.720
<v Speaker 3>I forgive me for being a little bit of a liberal who wants regulation on massive</v>

6713
02:50:36.721 --> 02:50:37.530
<v Speaker 3>corporations,</v>

6714
02:50:37.530 --> 02:50:38.700
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just,</v>

6715
02:50:38.701 --> 02:50:38.860
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6716
02:50:38.860 --> 02:50:41.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm surprised I don't see it from other people on the left.</v>

6717
02:50:41.980 --> 02:50:45.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a very compelling argument and I think the more it's fleshed out,</v>

6718
02:50:45.431 --> 02:50:46.510
<v Speaker 1>the more it seems to.</v>

6719
02:50:46.840 --> 02:50:48.160
<v Speaker 1>we definitely have an issue.</v>

6720
02:50:48.310 --> 02:50:50.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a giant issue and it doesn't go</v>

6721
02:50:50.740 --> 02:50:50.940
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

6722
02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:51.940
<v Speaker 3>You just banned people.</v>

6723
02:50:52.150 --> 02:50:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh no.</v>

6724
02:50:52.570 --> 02:50:53.830
<v Speaker 3>You create parallel economies,</v>

6725
02:50:53.831 --> 02:50:57.550
<v Speaker 3>worlds and you end up with a backlash.</v>

6726
02:50:58.270 --> 02:50:59.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6727
02:50:59.230 --> 02:51:00.063
<v Speaker 3>Well listen man.</v>

6728
02:51:00.100 --> 02:51:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6729
02:51:00.650 --> 02:51:01.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm really happy you came.</v>

6730
02:51:01.820 --> 02:51:04.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm really happy we did this and just thank you.</v>

6731
02:51:04.550 --> 02:51:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for educating me on this and giving you a perspective and it's a very,</v>

6732
02:51:09.690 --> 02:51:13.340
<v Speaker 1>very articulate and very intelligent perspective and I really appreciate it.</v>

6733
02:51:13.341 --> 02:51:18.110
<v Speaker 1>And I think for everyone this helps us to sort of get an understanding of,</v>

6734
02:51:18.770 --> 02:51:19.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6735
02:51:19.090 --> 02:51:19.740
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

6736
02:51:19.740 --> 02:51:20.170
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

6737
02:51:20.170 --> 02:51:22.790
<v Speaker 1>the whole spectrum of what's going on with all this stuff.</v>

6738
02:51:23.140 --> 02:51:23.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6739
02:51:23.560 --> 02:51:24.730
<v Speaker 3>And alice add by saying,</v>

6740
02:51:24.731 --> 02:51:25.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'm the smaRtest person in the world.</v>

6741
02:51:26.140 --> 02:51:26.820
<v Speaker 3>I probably got a lot.</v>

6742
02:51:26.820 --> 02:51:27.910
<v Speaker 3>I probably get a lot wrong.</v>

6743
02:51:28.250 --> 02:51:31.390
<v Speaker 3>I do my best to try and have my facts straight.</v>

6744
02:51:31.391 --> 02:51:32.470
<v Speaker 3>If I don't forgive me,</v>

6749
02:51:35.770 --> 02:51:38.050
<v Speaker 3>but I appreciate your perspective.</v>

6750

<v Speaker 3>Thank you brother.</v>

6751
