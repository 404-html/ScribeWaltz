00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also don't know if life can actually</v>

2
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:10.341
<v Speaker 1>evolve and progress just through pure</v>
<v Speaker 1>logic or pure rationality.</v>

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.520
<v Speaker 1>I think chance is very important in life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I also think being creative and</v>

4
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>creative must to some extent involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That ridiculousness at least must</v>

5
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:22.620
<v Speaker 1>involve the question of asking why now</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might get more logical and rational</v>

6
00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>as we go forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not sure we're ever going to</v>

7
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:29.511
<v Speaker 1>completely be the perfect mathematical</v>
<v Speaker 1>model that we would want to be A.</v>

8
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even sure that if we had perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>if let's just say hypothetically we</v>
<v Speaker 1>became that perfect intelligence.</v>

10
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 1>We might purposely sabotage ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so that we always have that element</v>

11
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>of irrationality in our lives to keep us</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the go,</v>

12
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 1>to keep us moving forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep us evolving.</v>

13
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>So I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first part of that.</v>

14
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I think the second part of what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking about,</v>

15
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>the the interesting thing that I always</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell people,</v>

16
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:59.061
<v Speaker 1>because I get asked this question a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that right now our current perception</v>

17
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>of the universe is pretty limited.</v>

18
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our ISI can only see about one percent</v>

19
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>of the light spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our ears can hear far less than one</v>

20
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:09.400
<v Speaker 1>percent of the of the sound waves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's possible in the universe,</v>

21
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.660
<v Speaker 1>so our actual ability to determine what</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in the universe is completely</v>

22
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>limited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

23
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>so limited that were were just basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting tiny bits of it.</v>

24
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.850
<v Speaker 1>As we get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we progress forward,</v>

25
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to have apps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more applications towards getting a</v>

26
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>better perception and our senses of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe really entails.</v>

27
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>We'll all have night vision will have be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to see different types of gases in</v>

28
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:38.410
<v Speaker 1>the air and we'll we'll have different</v>
<v Speaker 1>types of feelings that are based in with</v>

29
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.390
<v Speaker 1>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kind of a hypersensitive and that</v>

30
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>in itself will give us so many new</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences and I try to tell this to</v>

31
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>people a lot that we're actually going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to become much more complex.</v>

32
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>We think this is our world around us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually if you and I had bionic</v>

33
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:57.240
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd see that there are maybe a billion</v>

34
00:01:57.241 --> 00:02:00.630
<v Speaker 1>different organisms in this room that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are also interacting with us.</v>

35
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's gonna maybe take us</v>

36
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>down a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either a smart or a bad path,</v>

37
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's something that could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

38
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:12.060
<v Speaker 1>that could take us to other ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>other ways of experiencing the world</v>

39
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.030
<v Speaker 1>that makes it so it's not either boring</v>
<v Speaker 1>or makes it so it's not.</v>

40
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:15.864
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.010
<v Speaker 1>so kinda crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

42
00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:18.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

43
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that humans are ever gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>end transhumans at least to start with</v>

44
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>are going to give up some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous aspects of their life because</v>

45
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that motivates us is</v>

46
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:34.410
<v Speaker 1>fun and one of the things in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in human experience that is fun is being</v>

47
00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:35.244
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

48
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>So I think you need that creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need that creative element in the</v>

49
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that most I've ever done was I</v>

50
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>think $10,000 to some corporate event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>

51
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>People showed up to see me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a Sammy Hagar was on and Steve</v>

52
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Miller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on.</v>

53
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You worked a Sammy Hagar and Steve.</v>

54
00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 1>But what does Steve Miller looked like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you even recognize them?</v>

55
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.150
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

56
00:02:58.151 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>because the album was the white horse</v>
<v Speaker 1>lake,</v>

57
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:03.950
<v Speaker 1>so my whole teenage years of listened</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

58
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I've never saw what he looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked like a dad with a blazer and</v>

59
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>jeans and just went out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about Steve Miller.</v>

60
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>He is the least recognizable major.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He walk around Rockstar.</v>

61
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>He could walk around anywhere and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed like he never tried to become</v>

62
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 1>famous or you're going to out him on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast that Steve Miller.</v>

63
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like now.</v>

64
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had some fucking jams.</v>

65
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Jungalow love that was high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole album reminds me of high</v>

66
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:33.530
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the money alone.</v>

67
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>This is a story about Billy Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We thought we thought we were cool too</v>

68
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:43.340
<v Speaker 1>because we're listening to classic rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was technically they were into this</v>

69
00:03:43.341 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not this new edition.</v>

70
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fucking weird,</v>

71
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to high school in 1981 and in</v>

72
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>1981 I started hanging out with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

73
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 1>I just moved into town into a Newton</v>
<v Speaker 1>upper falls and I started hanging out</v>

74
00:03:56.651 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 1>with my friend Jimmy and Jimmy and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his friends were all,</v>

75
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the other side of town there.</v>

76
00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 1>They're all like the north part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newton and they were all like,</v>

77
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>everyone had doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tee shirts and they were all smoking</v>

78
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>weed and it was like they introduced me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to all this music that I didn't even</v>

79
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:14.134
<v Speaker 1>know existed.</v>

80
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 1>But when I think about it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shit was only 10 years old.</v>

81
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the allman brothers,</v>

82
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were playing like some allman</v>

83
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>brothers are some doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit is from like 1969,</v>

84
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 1>1970.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the time we're talking wwe,</v>

85
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I went to high school in [inaudible] 81.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my freshman year.</v>

86
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.521
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>

87
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 years old as fuck.</v>

88
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like some music from 2001 that's</v>

89
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 1>contemporary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:43.111
<v Speaker 1>like a song from 2002.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could still hear like on a regular</v>

91
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>basis that would be on a radio station</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was eighties,</v>

92
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:50.370
<v Speaker 1>nineties and hits sex and can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

93
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 1>you can hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could easily hear that someone could</v>

94
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 1>play that non.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ironically on a regular radio station,</v>

95
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

96
00:04:57.281 --> 00:04:59.920
<v Speaker 1>you remember this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a song that would play,</v>

97
00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:01.850
<v Speaker 1>but that sex and candy song came out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

98
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.910
<v Speaker 1>like 99 or some shit.</v>

99
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about that.</v>

100
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't say,</v>

101
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the classic.</v>

102
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Something fucking happened to time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

103
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Time is not what it used to be 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago doesn't mean shit anymore,</v>

104
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>but 10 years ago back then meant a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was in high school and then in</v>

105
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:27.091
<v Speaker 1>1981 and 1970 car was a mother fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had a 1970 Chevelle or a 1970</v>

108
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.600
<v Speaker 1>It's only 10 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck happened?</v>

109
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:43.660
<v Speaker 1>And he does that when it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The acceleration,</v>

110

<v Speaker 1>and I have a pretty big bed,</v>

116
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:58.090
<v Speaker 1>but underneath the bed it's</v>

117
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 2>like in the middle you'll never get</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything on,</v>

118
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if something falls under the bed.</v>

119
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 2>So I was trying to get everything and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled out a single cheeseburger from</v>

120
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's that I guess I was eating and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like threw,</v>

121
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.550
<v Speaker 2>threw it on the ground or something and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just went in there and get it to you.</v>

122
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.870
<v Speaker 2>I know you live like I haven't had</v>
<v Speaker 2>mcdonalds in my bed for at least six</v>

123
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 2>months and so that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I opened it,</v>

124
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 2>it looked brand new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looked just exactly the same.</v>

125
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:30.250
<v Speaker 2>You would buy it at perfect apartments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the raft of a survivor's stranded</v>

126
00:06:30.251 --> 00:06:33.550
<v Speaker 2>at sea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just scattered disarray with</v>

127
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.560
<v Speaker 2>bobbers and nets and one shoe</v>
<v Speaker 2>pirate in the corner for some reason.</v>

128
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That big area in the middle where you</v>

129
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:45.100
<v Speaker 2>can reach under your bed area is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

130
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 2>It's disgusting because if you ever do</v>
<v Speaker 2>move your bed,</v>

131
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 2>your bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like looking at it going,</v>

132
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.120
<v Speaker 2>that's so gross.</v>

133
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.830
<v Speaker 2>How much would I have to pay you to lick</v>
<v Speaker 2>that center area where you can't reach?</v>

134
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.700
<v Speaker 2>Just do the whole line on the line from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the head to the.</v>

135
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.530
<v Speaker 2>Keep your tongue down on the ground from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the foot of the bed to the head of the</v>

136
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:04.550
<v Speaker 2>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like an Imac</v>

137
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.600
<v Speaker 2>could only take an imac to get you to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

138
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

139
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about Ipad mini?</v>

140
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.890
<v Speaker 2>I licked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I licked the bowl.</v>

141
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 2>I licked the stripper pole at a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl is a couple of months ago on stage</v>

142
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.680
<v Speaker 2>because we were doing comedy there and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just said some hot girl just got off and</v>

143
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:25.761
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

144
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:28.220
<v Speaker 2>that girl is hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just like licked it as a joke.</v>

145
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

146
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 2>but then I thought about it and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had like a canker on my time for like</v>

147
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:37.490
<v Speaker 2>three days.</v>

148
00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:41.420

<v Speaker 2>I was freaked out for a couple of days,</v>

149
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:44.690
<v Speaker 2>but it was so hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is so hilarious.</v>

150
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.630
<v Speaker 2>David Arquette owns that place now and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>told him like he would.</v>

151
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.860
<v Speaker 2>He did kill Tony and I told him about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

152
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.020
<v Speaker 2>You just give me a high five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

153
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:52.640
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

154
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 2>He owns a strip club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a good move for a fucking celebrity</v>

155
00:07:57.081 --> 00:07:58.190
<v Speaker 2>that's just getting divorced.</v>

156
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.800
<v Speaker 2>What an excellent move and that places</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.460

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

158
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.250

<v Speaker 2>Shows are like music sometimes and that</v>

159
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 2>it's totally not set up for comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>though because they have like a strobe</v>

160
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:15.230
<v Speaker 2>light facing the comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're onstage and you're just having</v>

161
00:08:15.231 --> 00:08:17.450
<v Speaker 2>elliptic caesars and you can't see</v>
