<v Speaker 1>How does one,</v>

10
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm just in the middle of doing all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you do,</v>

11
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.010
<v Speaker 1>create cars or rockets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff you're doing constantly </v>

12
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>innovating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to just make a flame thrower.</v>

13
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.240
<v Speaker 2>Where do you have time for that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

14
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 2>the famous Edwin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't put a lot of time into the </v>

15
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 2>flame thrower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

16
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.030
<v Speaker 2>this was an off the cuff thing and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so have sort of like sort of a sort of a</v>

17
00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:47.341
<v Speaker 2>hobby company called the boring company </v>
<v Speaker 2>which started out as a joke and we </v>

18
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 2>decided to make a real um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

19
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.110
<v Speaker 2>and dig a tunnel under la and then dig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then people,</v>

20
00:00:56.111 --> 00:01:01.111
<v Speaker 2>other people asked us to dig tunnels and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we said yes in a few cases and then </v>

21
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.930
<v Speaker 2>we have a merchandise section that only </v>
<v Speaker 2>has one piece of merchandise at a time.</v>

22
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 2>And we started off with a cap and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was only one thing on,</v>

23
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.270
<v Speaker 2>it was just boring company.com/cap</v>
<v Speaker 2>or hat.</v>

24
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.810
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we sold the hats,</v>

25
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.690
<v Speaker 2>limited limited edition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just said the boring company.</v>

26
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm big kind of space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both the movie and in spaceballs yogurt </v>

27
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.230
<v Speaker 2>goes through the merchandising section </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have a flame thrower in the </v>

28
00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:42.481
<v Speaker 2>merchandising section of spaceballs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like the kids love that one.</v>

29
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 2>That's the line of when he pulls up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>claim for.</v>

30
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like we should do a flame thrower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we.</v>

31
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.730
<v Speaker 1>does anybody go elan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but selling a flame thrower,</v>

34
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.080
<v Speaker 1>the liabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the people you're selling this </v>

35
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.841
<v Speaker 1>device to what kind of unhinged people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be buying a flame thrower </v>

36
00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:10.130
<v Speaker 1>in the first place to really want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>connect ourselves to all these potential</v>

37
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:12.860
<v Speaker 1>arsonists yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible idea.</v>

38
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Terrible by one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

39
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:20.210
<v Speaker 1>don't buy this flame thrower to buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't buy it.</v>

40
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:22.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still people bought it.</v>

41
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing I can do to stop them.</v>

42
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.170
<v Speaker 1>You build them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

43
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.030
<v Speaker 1>don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad idea.</v>

44
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.610
<v Speaker 1>How many did you make your w?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous.</v>

45
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.560
<v Speaker 1>It's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong.</v>

46
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People bought it.</v>

47
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't stop them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many did you make?</v>

48
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.190
<v Speaker 1>$20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're all gone in three,</v>

49
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.230
<v Speaker 1>I think four days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sold out in four days.</v>

50
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to do another run?</v>

51
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now let's it.</v>

52
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

53
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.200
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well do 20 that we did $50,000.</v>

54
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 2>40,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>hats.</v>

55
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

56
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.740
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a million dollars and he's </v>

57
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.740
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

58
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.941
<v Speaker 3>well we'll sell something for 10 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was 20,000</v>

59
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:17.251
<v Speaker 3>flame throwers at $500 each.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went fast.</v>

60
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you have the time to do that </v>

61
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.940
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

62
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.181
<v Speaker 3>I understand that it's not a big deal in</v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of all the other things that you </v>

63
00:03:27.181 --> 00:03:27.181
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how do you have time to do anything?</v>

64
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.190
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand your time management </v>

65
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.190
<v Speaker 3>skills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

66
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 3>I didn't spend much time on this flame </v>
<v Speaker 3>thrower.</v>

67
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be totally frank,</v>

68
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 3>it's actually just a roofing torch with </v>
<v Speaker 3>an air rifle cover.</v>

69
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.020
<v Speaker 3>It's not a real flame thrower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why it says not a flame </v>

70
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 3>thrower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we were very clear.</v>

71
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.750
<v Speaker 3>This is not actually a flame thrower </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

72
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.850
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it also were told that various </v>

73
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.720
<v Speaker 3>countries were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were banned shipping of it would,</v>

74
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 3>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would band flame throwers.</v>

75
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 3>So we've got to solve this problem for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the customs agencies.</v>

76
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:04.260
<v Speaker 3>We labeled it not a flame thrower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That work.</v>

77
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 3>Is it effective?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

78
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:07.340
<v Speaker 3>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

79
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 3>So far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

80
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.530
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you just said you cannot serve a </v>

81
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.601
<v Speaker 3>flame thrower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you do so many different things and </v>

82
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 3>forget about the flame thrower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you do all that other shit?</v>

83
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>

84
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does one decide to fix la traffic by</v>

85
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 3>drilling holes in the ground and who do </v>
<v Speaker 3>you even approach with that?</v>

86
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Like when you have this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who do you talk to about that?</v>

87
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's going to be </v>

88
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.370
<v Speaker 3>successful or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

89
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 3>I know it's just like asserting that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be successful,</v>

90
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.800
<v Speaker 3>but so far I've lived in La for 16 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the traffic has always been terrible</v>

91
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 3>and so I don't see any other ideas for </v>
<v Speaker 3>improving the traffic.</v>

92
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in desperation where you're going to </v>

93
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.280
<v Speaker 3>dig a tunnel and maybe that tunnel will </v>
<v Speaker 3>be successful and maybe it won't.</v>

94
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm listening.</v>

95
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to convince you it's </v>

96
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.260
<v Speaker 3>going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And are the people that you or anyone.</v>

97
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.300
<v Speaker 3>But you were starting this though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is actually a project you're </v>

98
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.300
<v Speaker 3>starting to implement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

99
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

100
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 3>we've dug about a mile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's quite long.</v>

101
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 3>Take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Takes a long time to Wolcott yeah.</v>

102
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.320
<v Speaker 3>Now when you do in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

103
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.360
<v Speaker 3>what is the ultimate plan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ultimate plan is to have these in </v>

104
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.330
<v Speaker 3>major cities in anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's mass congestion and just try it </v>

105
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.330
<v Speaker 3>out in la first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

106
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in La because I mostly live in la.</v>

107
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 3>That's the reason as a terrible place to</v>
<v Speaker 3>dig tunnels.</v>

108
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the worst places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dig Tunnels,</v>

109
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:40.360
<v Speaker 3>because the does mostly because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>paperwork you will think.</v>

110
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:45.361
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about seismic is actually both </v>

111
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 3>tunnels are very safe in earthquakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why's that?</v>

112
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.330
<v Speaker 3>Earthquakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Earthquakes are essentially of surface </v>

113
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like waves on the ocean.</v>

114
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.660
<v Speaker 3>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

115
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's a storm,</v>

116
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 3>you want to be on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on in a submarine.</v>

117
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 2>So being in a tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like being in a submarine.</v>

118
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Now the way the towels construct is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's constructed out of these </v>

119
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.790
<v Speaker 2>interlocking segments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like a snake.</v>

120
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like a snake exoskeleton </v>

121
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.650
<v Speaker 2>with a double seals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so even when the ground moves,</v>

122
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.380
<v Speaker 2>the it's able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tunnel actually is able to shift </v>

123
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.740
<v Speaker 2>along with the ground like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>underground snake and it doesn't crack </v>

124
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.750
<v Speaker 2>or break or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

125
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.300
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

126
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.630
<v Speaker 2>and it's extremely unlikely that both </v>
<v Speaker 2>seals would be broken and it's,</v>

127
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a capable of taking five </v>

128
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 2>atmospheres of pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's waterproof.</v>

129
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Methane proof will gas proof of any kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

130
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meets old California seismic </v>

131
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.380
<v Speaker 2>requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you have this idea,</v>

132
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 2>who do you bring this to?</v>

133
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure what you mean by that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well when you,</v>

134
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're implementing it,</v>

135
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:58.721
<v Speaker 4>so you're digging holes in the ground </v>
<v Speaker 4>like you have to bring it to someone </v>

136
00:06:58.721 --> 00:06:58.721
<v Speaker 4>that lets you do it.</v>

137
00:06:58.721 --> 00:06:58.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

138
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>

139
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.300
<v Speaker 2>there were some engineers from space x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

140
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:10.590
<v Speaker 2>who were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who thought it would be cool to do this </v>

141
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.610
<v Speaker 2>and the guy runs it like day to day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Davis,</v>

142
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.850
<v Speaker 2>he's long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>longtime space x engineer.</v>

143
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 2>He's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

144
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.440
<v Speaker 2>so steve was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to help make this happen.</v>

145
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:24.100
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

146
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.930
<v Speaker 2>And so we started off with digging a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hole in the ground.</v>

147
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.380
<v Speaker 2>It's got like a permit for a pit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pit,</v>

148
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.360
<v Speaker 2>and just dug a big pit.</v>

149
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 4>Do you have to tell them what the pits </v>
<v Speaker 4>for or you just say,</v>

150
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just want to dig a hole.</v>

151
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fill out this form.</v>

152
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.480
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

153
00:07:43.481 --> 00:07:44.740
<v Speaker 2>it was a in our parking lot.</v>

154
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:50.190
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but do you have to give them some sort </v>

155
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:50.470
<v Speaker 4>of a blueprint for your ultimate idea?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And do they have to approve it?</v>

156
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.340
<v Speaker 4>Like how does that work</v>

157
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.620
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just started off with a pit big pit </v>

158
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

159
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.970
<v Speaker 2>there's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

160
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.090
<v Speaker 2>they don't really care about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>existential nature of a pit.</v>

161
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.340
<v Speaker 2>You just say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want a pit,</v>

162
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

163
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.640
<v Speaker 2>And a hole in the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then we got the permit for the pit </v>

164
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.280
<v Speaker 2>and we dug the pit and we dug it in like</v>
<v Speaker 2>three days,</v>

165
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.290
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three days actually to 48 hours,</v>

166
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.930
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

167
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.330
<v Speaker 2>cause uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric are steady,</v>

168
00:08:22.331 --> 00:08:27.331
<v Speaker 2>was coming by for the hype to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to attend the hyperloop </v>

169
00:08:27.331 --> 00:08:27.500
<v Speaker 2>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which like a student competition we have</v>

170
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:31.040
<v Speaker 2>for a who can make the fastest pod in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hyperloop.</v>

171
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.320
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was coming.</v>

172
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 2>This was get the files are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Sunday afternoon.</v>

173
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:37.560
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

174
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 2>Eric was coming by on Sunday afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

175
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:40.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should take this pit.</v>

176
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.560
<v Speaker 2>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

177
00:08:41.561 --> 00:08:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Eric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

178
00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:47.060
<v Speaker 2>so we was like Friday morning and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

179
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 2>So it was about a little over 40 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty hours later we dug the pit.</v>

180
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.380
<v Speaker 2>There's like when 24 slash seven or 24 </v>
<v Speaker 2>or 48 straight hours,</v>

181
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:59.590
<v Speaker 2>something like and dug this big pit and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

182
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 2>and we're like showed eric the pit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like obviously it's just a pit,</v>

183
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's holding the ground is better than </v>

184
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.351
<v Speaker 1>no hole in the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do you tell them about this </v>

185
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:13.351
<v Speaker 1>pit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just said this is the starting of</v>

186
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:13.690
<v Speaker 1>this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

187
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.740
<v Speaker 1>we're going to build tunnels under la to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help funnel traffic better and their </v>

188
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:18.940
<v Speaker 1>girls and they just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

189
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.810
<v Speaker 1>That we've joked around about this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast before too,</v>

190
00:09:22.811 --> 00:09:26.020
<v Speaker 1>like what are the person can go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that run the city and go,</v>

191
00:09:26.021 --> 00:09:31.021
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to dig some holes on the </v>

192
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:31.021
<v Speaker 1>ground and puts him tunnels in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>

193
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:31.021
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

194
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Now I know where the hole in the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's people dig holes in the ground </v>

195
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:36.260
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

196
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:36.530
<v Speaker 1>But my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my question is like,</v>

197
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:40.240
<v Speaker 1>I know how much time you must be </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending on your Tesla factory.</v>

198
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I know how much time you must be </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending on space x and yet you still </v>

199
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.141
<v Speaker 1>have time to dig holes under the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>in La and come up with these ideas and </v>

200
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:49.210
<v Speaker 1>then implement them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

201
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I've got a million ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you just.</v>

202
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:51.870
<v Speaker 1>No shortage.</v>

203
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:53.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

204
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.510
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know how you manage your </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

205
00:09:55.511 --> 00:09:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem.</v>

206
00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.200
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even seem humanly possible.</v>

207
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:01.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

208
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.140
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

209
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.410
<v Speaker 2>I think people like don't totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what I do with my time.</v>

210
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.250
<v Speaker 2>They think like I'm a business guy or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

211
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wikipedia page says,</v>

212
00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:14.990
<v Speaker 2>business magnate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you call yourself?</v>

213
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:16.880
<v Speaker 2>A business magnet.</v>

214
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Please change my wikipedia page to </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnet.</v>

215
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.070
<v Speaker 1>They'll change right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably already changed.</v>

216
00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:28.071
<v Speaker 1>It's locked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So somebody has to be able to unlock it </v>

217
00:10:28.071 --> 00:10:28.071
<v Speaker 1>and change it to magnus.</v>

218
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

219
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:35.060
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do engineering and manufacturing and </v>

220
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.341
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like 80 percent or more of my </v>

221
00:10:39.341 --> 00:10:39.341
<v Speaker 2>time</v>

222
00:10:39.341 --> 00:10:42.570
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the implementation of those </v>

223
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:42.570
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

224
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like hardcore engineering,</v>

225
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.090
<v Speaker 2>like designing things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

226
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Structural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanical,</v>

227
00:10:48.971 --> 00:10:50.590
<v Speaker 2>electrical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>software,</v>

228
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.820
<v Speaker 2>a user interface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering,</v>

229
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:55.810
<v Speaker 2>aerospace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering.</v>

230
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.170
<v Speaker 1>But you must understand there's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole lot of human beings like you.</v>

231
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.140
<v Speaker 1>You know that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To your an audit teams?</v>

232
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To chimps.</v>

233
00:11:03.731 --> 00:11:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all chimps.</v>

234
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are.</v>

235
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.230
<v Speaker 1>We're wanting to watch one notch above a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimp.</v>

236
00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Some of us are a little more confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I watched you doing all these </v>

237
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.141
<v Speaker 1>things and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is this motherfucker have all this </v>

238
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:17.440
<v Speaker 1>time and all this energy and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

239
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.090
<v Speaker 1>and then people just let them do these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things</v>

240
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.380
<v Speaker 2>because I'm an alien.</v>

241
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.560
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've speculated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

242
00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm on record saying this in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

243
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.980
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if there was one,</v>

244
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.040
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was like maybe an intelligent </v>

245
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.260
<v Speaker 1>being that we created some ai creature </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a superior to people,</v>

246
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.500
<v Speaker 1>maybe they just hang around with us for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little while like you've been doing </v>

247
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.750
<v Speaker 1>and then fix a bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the way my tufts on </v>

248
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.320
<v Speaker 1>retainer or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might.</v>

249
00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

250
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you wonder like you around normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

251
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.370
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

252
00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.960
<v Speaker 2>Think what's up with these boring dumb </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother fuckers ever?</v>

253
00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Not Bad for a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it will not be able to hold </v>

254
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:04.390
<v Speaker 2>a candle to ai.</v>

255
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:09.790
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You scare the shit out of me when you </v>

256
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.790
<v Speaker 4>talk about Ai between you and Sam </v>
<v Speaker 4>Harris.</v>

257
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:14.300
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Consider it until at a podcast with Sam </v>

258
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:14.300
<v Speaker 4>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

259
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.490
<v Speaker 4>He made me Shit my pants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talking about Ai,</v>

260
00:12:16.491 --> 00:12:21.491
<v Speaker 4>I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well this is a genie that wants out </v>

261
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:21.491
<v Speaker 4>of the bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never get it back in.</v>

262
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.030
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a video that you tweeted about</v>

263
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.480
<v Speaker 4>one of those Boston dynamic robots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in the future it will be moving so </v>

264
00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.670
<v Speaker 4>fast you can't see it without a strobe </v>
<v Speaker 4>light.</v>

265
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:41.130
<v Speaker 4>You could probably do that right now and</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one's really paying attention too </v>

266
00:12:41.271 --> 00:12:46.271
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other than people like you or people </v>

267
00:12:46.271 --> 00:12:46.271
<v Speaker 4>that are really obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>

268
00:12:46.271 --> 00:12:48.550
<v Speaker 4>All these things are happening and these</v>
<v Speaker 4>robots or did you see the one where it.</v>

269
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.920
<v Speaker 4>Peta put out a statement that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't kick robots.</v>

270
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:57.680
<v Speaker 4>It's probably not wise for retribution </v>
<v Speaker 4>that their memory is pretty good.</v>

271
00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.270
<v Speaker 4>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really good.</v>

272
00:12:59.271 --> 00:13:00.680
<v Speaker 4>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet it is.</v>

273
00:13:00.681 --> 00:13:02.150
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and getting better every day.</v>

274
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.370
<v Speaker 4>It's really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you honestly,</v>

275
00:13:04.371 --> 00:13:07.760
<v Speaker 4>legitimately concerned about this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you the AI,</v>

276
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:12.050
<v Speaker 4>one of your main worries in regards to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the future?</v>

277
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

278
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:22.890
<v Speaker 2>it's less of a worry than it used to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>a mostly due to taking more of a </v>

279
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:25.120
<v Speaker 2>fatalistic attitude.</v>

280
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:30.490
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you used to have more hope and you </v>

281
00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:35.621
<v Speaker 4>gave up some of it and now you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>worry as much about ai you like this is </v>

282
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:35.870
<v Speaker 4>just what it is.</v>

283
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

284
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:40.930
<v Speaker 2>pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

285
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.450
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily bad.</v>

286
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:52.130
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely going to be outside of </v>

287
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:52.500
<v Speaker 2>human control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily bad,</v>

288
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

289
00:13:53.181 --> 00:13:54.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily bad,</v>

290
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.660
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just outside of human control.</v>

291
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing that's going to be tricky </v>
<v Speaker 2>here is that it's going to be very </v>

292
00:14:03.511 --> 00:14:07.710
<v Speaker 2>tempting to use ai as a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be very tempting in fact</v>

293
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.430
<v Speaker 2>will be used as a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

294
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:13.910
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

295
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.040
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the onramp to serious ai,</v>

296
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:23.520
<v Speaker 2>the danger is going to be more humans </v>
<v Speaker 2>using it against each other.</v>

297
00:14:23.521 --> 00:14:27.300
<v Speaker 2>I think most likely that'll be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>danger.</v>

298
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

299
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:33.580
<v Speaker 4>How far do you think we are from </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that can make its own mind up,</v>

300
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:38.610
<v Speaker 4>whether or not something's ethically or </v>
<v Speaker 4>morally correct or they're not at wants </v>

301
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:39.370
<v Speaker 4>to do something or whether or not he </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to improve itself,</v>

302
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:43.690
<v Speaker 4>whether or not it wants to protect </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself from people or from other Ai.</v>

303
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.690
<v Speaker 4>How far away we suffer from something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really truly sent you in?</v>

304
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.180
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you could argue that any group of</v>

305
00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:01.210
<v Speaker 5>people like like a company is </v>
<v Speaker 5>essentially a cybernetic collective of </v>

306
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:06.470
<v Speaker 5>people and machines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what a company is</v>

307
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:14.350
<v Speaker 2>and then there are different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's different levels of complexity </v>

308
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.880
<v Speaker 2>in the way these companies are formed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there are sort of.</v>

309
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:25.910
<v Speaker 2>There's this like a collective ai in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the google sort of search,</v>

310
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Google search,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the where we're all sort of </v>

311
00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.200
<v Speaker 2>plugged in as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nodes on the network,</v>

312
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:39.040
<v Speaker 2>like leaves on a big tree or in rural </v>
<v Speaker 2>rural feeding this network with our </v>

313
00:15:40.911 --> 00:15:45.911
<v Speaker 2>questions and answers all collectively </v>
<v Speaker 2>programming the ai and the the and </v>

314
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.920
<v Speaker 2>Google plus the older humans that </v>
<v Speaker 2>connect to it are one giant cybernetic </v>

315
00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:59.351
<v Speaker 2>collective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is also true of facebook and </v>

316
00:15:59.351 --> 00:16:00.980
<v Speaker 2>twitter and instagram and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of networks.</v>

317
00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:04.220
<v Speaker 2>The dryness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had a collectives.</v>

318
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.190
<v Speaker 4>Humans and electronics all interfacing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and constantly.</v>

319
00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.360
<v Speaker 4>Constantly connected.</v>

320
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>

321
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:20.290
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that I have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about a lot over the last few </v>

322
00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.650
<v Speaker 4>years is that one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>drives a lot of people crazy is how how </v>

323
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:28.661
<v Speaker 4>many people are obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 4>materialism and getting the latest </v>

324
00:16:28.661 --> 00:16:29.750
<v Speaker 4>greatest thing and I wonder how much of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is.</v>

325
00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.780
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it is most certainly fueling </v>

326
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.601
<v Speaker 4>technology and innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It almost seems like it's built into us </v>

327
00:16:37.601 --> 00:16:41.790
<v Speaker 4>to like what we like and what we want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're fueling this thing that's </v>

328
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.701
<v Speaker 4>constantly around us all the time and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't seem possible that people are </v>

329
00:16:45.701 --> 00:16:48.911
<v Speaker 4>going to pump the brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem possible at this stage </v>

330
00:16:48.911 --> 00:16:49.700
<v Speaker 4>where we're constantly adding new cell </v>
<v Speaker 4>phone,</v>

331
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.530
<v Speaker 4>the latest Tesla update the newest </v>
<v Speaker 4>macbook pro,</v>

332
00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:57.540
<v Speaker 4>but everything has to be newer and </v>
<v Speaker 4>better and that's going to lead to some </v>

333
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.070
<v Speaker 4>incredible point and it seems like it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>built into us.</v>

334
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:08.240
<v Speaker 4>It almost seems like it's an instinct </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we were working towards this,</v>

335
00:17:08.241 --> 00:17:12.560
<v Speaker 4>that we'd like it our job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like the ants build the ant hill.</v>

336
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.750
<v Speaker 4>Our job is to somehow or another fuel </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

337
00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:23.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made those comments some some years </v>

338
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:27.690
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it feels like we are the biological </v>

339
00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.631
<v Speaker 2>bootloader for ai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Effectively we are building it and then </v>

340
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.080
<v Speaker 2>we're building progressively greater </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and the percentage of </v>

341
00:17:38.831 --> 00:17:43.831
<v Speaker 2>intelligence that is not human is </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasing and eventually we will </v>

342
00:17:44.621 --> 00:17:47.170
<v Speaker 2>represent a very small percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>

343
00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.440
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the AI isn't formed strangely by the </v>

344
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.731
<v Speaker 2>human limbic system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is in large part our ed writ large.</v>

345
00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.270
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

346
00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.290
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of primal drives.</v>

347
00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:14.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all old things that we like and </v>

348
00:18:16.091 --> 00:18:21.091
<v Speaker 2>hate and fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all there on the internet,</v>

349
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.460
<v Speaker 2>their projection of our limbic system.</v>

350
00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.250
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

351
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.270
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense.</v>

352
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:38.880
<v Speaker 4>Then the thinking of it as a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me think of thinking of corporations</v>

353
00:18:38.881 --> 00:18:43.881
<v Speaker 4>and just thinking of just human beings </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicating online through these </v>

354
00:18:43.881 --> 00:18:43.881
<v Speaker 4>social media networks as some sort of an</v>
<v Speaker 4>organism.</v>

355
00:18:43.881 --> 00:18:45.910
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a Cyborg.</v>

356
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:51.710
<v Speaker 4>It's a combination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a combination of electronics and </v>

357
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.710
<v Speaker 4>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

358
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.820
<v Speaker 2>This is in some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some measure,</v>

359
00:18:55.090 --> 00:19:00.090
<v Speaker 2>the success of these online systems is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is sort of a function of,</v>

360
00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:08.160
<v Speaker 2>of how much limbic resonance they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to achieve with people.</v>

361
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.400
<v Speaker 2>The more limbic resonance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more engagement.</v>

362
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:13.940
<v Speaker 5>MMM.</v>

363
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:20.160
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably instagram is more enticing than</v>

364
00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:22.350
<v Speaker 4>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Limbic resonance.</v>

365
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get more images,</v>

366
00:19:24.811 --> 00:19:26.090
<v Speaker 4>more video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

367
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.230
<v Speaker 4>Tweaking your system more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

368
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.680
<v Speaker 4>Do you worry about or wonder in fact of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what the next step is?</v>

369
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:37.750
<v Speaker 4>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people didn't see twitter </v>

370
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.750
<v Speaker 4>coming that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

371
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.250
<v Speaker 4>communicating with 140 characters or 280</v>
<v Speaker 4>now would be a thing that people would </v>

372
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:44.460
<v Speaker 4>be interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's going to excel.</v>

373
00:19:44.461 --> 00:19:46.500
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna become more connected to us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

374
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things are getting more and more </v>

375
00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:54.260
<v Speaker 2>connected there at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constrained by bandwidth.</v>

376
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:59.160
<v Speaker 2>Our input output is low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly output after got worse with</v>

377
00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.860
<v Speaker 2>thumbs and where you sort of input with </v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

378
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:06.950
<v Speaker 2>10 fingers now if thumbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but images are just are also other way </v>

379
00:20:08.161 --> 00:20:13.161
<v Speaker 2>of communicating at high bandwidth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take pictures and you send pictures </v>

380
00:20:13.161 --> 00:20:15.060
<v Speaker 2>people sends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

381
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.290
<v Speaker 2>that communicates far more information </v>
<v Speaker 2>than you can communicate with them.</v>

382
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.500
<v Speaker 4>So what happened with you where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>decided or you took on a more fatalistic</v>

383
00:20:23.501 --> 00:20:24.730
<v Speaker 4>attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what?</v>

384
00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.150
<v Speaker 4>Was there any specific thing or was it </v>
<v Speaker 4>just the inevitability of our future?</v>

385
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.720
<v Speaker 2>I tried to convince people to slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow down ai to regulate ai.</v>

386
00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:49.900
<v Speaker 2>This was few I tried for years.</v>

387
00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.720
<v Speaker 4>See Nobody listened to in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Robots.</v>

388
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.140
<v Speaker 4>Good fucking take over and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>freaking me out.</v>

389
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.000
<v Speaker 4>Nobody listened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody listens.</v>

390
00:20:58.001 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 4>No one are people more inclined to </v>
<v Speaker 4>listen today.</v>

391
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:05.940
<v Speaker 4>It seems like an issue that's brought up</v>
<v Speaker 4>more often over the last few years than </v>

392
00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:06.880
<v Speaker 4>it was maybe five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 years ago.</v>

393
00:21:06.881 --> 00:21:08.290
<v Speaker 4>It seemed like science fiction,</v>

394
00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.430
<v Speaker 2>maybe they will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So far they haven't.</v>

395
00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.200
<v Speaker 2>I think people don't like the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Normally.</v>

396
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.110
<v Speaker 2>The way the regulations work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very slow,</v>

397
00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.920
<v Speaker 2>very slow indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So usually it'll be something.</v>

398
00:21:28.551 --> 00:21:33.470
<v Speaker 2>Some of your technology will cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage or death.</v>

399
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.930
<v Speaker 2>There will be an outcry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will be an investigation.</v>

400
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:44.100
<v Speaker 2>You guys will pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There will be some sort of insights </v>

401
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:48.490
<v Speaker 2>committee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will be rulemaking than there will </v>

402
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:48.920
<v Speaker 2>be oversight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually regulations.</v>

403
00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.450
<v Speaker 2>This all takes many years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the normal course of things.</v>

404
00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.540
<v Speaker 2>If you look at say what a motive </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulations,</v>

405
00:21:56.541 --> 00:22:01.541
<v Speaker 2>how long did it take for seat belts to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be implemented to be required?</v>

406
00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Know the auto industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought seat belts,</v>

407
00:22:04.431 --> 00:22:09.431
<v Speaker 2>I think for more than a decade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>successfully fought any regulations on </v>

408
00:22:10.251 --> 00:22:15.251
<v Speaker 2>seat belts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the numbers were extremely </v>

409
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:17.060
<v Speaker 2>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had a seatbelt on,</v>

410
00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:22.770
<v Speaker 2>you will be far less likely to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be certainly entered was </v>

411
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.650
<v Speaker 2>unequivocal and the industry fought this</v>
<v Speaker 2>for years successfully.</v>

412
00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Eventually after many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people died.</v>

413
00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:40.180
<v Speaker 2>Regulators insisted on seatbelts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a.</v>

414
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.940
<v Speaker 2>This timeframe is not relevant to ai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't take 10 years from the point </v>

415
00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:47.970
<v Speaker 2>at which is dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so late</v>

416
00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:56.550
<v Speaker 4>and you feel like this is decades away </v>
<v Speaker 4>or years away from being too late.</v>

417
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.730
<v Speaker 4>If you have this fatalistic attitude and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you feel like it's going,</v>

418
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.900
<v Speaker 4>we're in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost like a doomsday countdown.</v>

419
00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.420
<v Speaker 4>It's not necessarily a doomsday </v>
<v Speaker 4>countdown.</v>

420
00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:11.700
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a out of control.</v>

421
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:12.220
<v Speaker 4>Countdown</v>

422
00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:13.220
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

423
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:17.660
<v Speaker 2>People call it the singularity and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

424
00:23:17.661 --> 00:23:18.680
<v Speaker 2>that's probably a good way to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

425
00:23:18.681 --> 00:23:19.470
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a singular.</v>

426
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:23.660
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to predict like a black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens past the event horizon?</v>

427
00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.780
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sort of once it's implemented,</v>

428
00:23:25.781 --> 00:23:28.210
<v Speaker 4>it's very different because it wants to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get out of the bottle,</v>

429
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:31.720
<v Speaker 4>what's going to happen and it will be </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to improve itself.</v>

430
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.470
<v Speaker 4>Pro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

431
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:35.480
<v Speaker 4>That's where it gets spooky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

432
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.870
<v Speaker 4>The idea that it can do thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 4>years of innovation.</v>

433
00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.370
<v Speaker 4>We're very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very quickly.</v>

434
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we'll be just ridiculous.</v>

435
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:49.430
<v Speaker 4>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We will be like this ridiculous </v>

436
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.770
<v Speaker 4>biological shitting pissing thing trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to stop the gods now stop.</v>

437
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:56.771
<v Speaker 4>We like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we like living with a finite lifespan </v>

438
00:23:56.771 --> 00:23:56.771
<v Speaker 4>and watching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

439
00:23:56.771 --> 00:23:56.990
<v Speaker 4>Norman Rockwell paintings.</v>

440
00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.710
<v Speaker 2>It could be terrible and it could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

441
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

442
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.320
<v Speaker 2>But one thing is for sure we will not </v>
<v Speaker 2>control it.</v>

443
00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:12.940
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that it's likely that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>will merge somehow or another with this </v>

444
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:18.580
<v Speaker 4>sort of technology and it will augment </v>
<v Speaker 4>what we are now or do you think it will </v>

445
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.070
<v Speaker 4>replace us?</v>

446
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the scenario that the merge </v>

447
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.361
<v Speaker 2>scenario with ai is the one that seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>like probably the best.</v>

448
00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Like us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

449
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can't beat it,</v>

450
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.680
<v Speaker 2>join it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

451
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

452
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:47.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so from a longterm existential </v>

453
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.720
<v Speaker 2>standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like the purpose of neuro link is</v>

454
00:24:53.721 --> 00:24:58.721
<v Speaker 2>to create a high bandwidth interface to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain such that we can be somebody </v>

455
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:06.110
<v Speaker 2>with ai because we have a bandwidth </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem that you just can't communicate </v>

456
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:10.781
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your fingers is too slow and whereas </v>

457
00:25:10.781 --> 00:25:11.000
<v Speaker 2>neural link at right now,</v>

458
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:18.310
<v Speaker 2>I think we'll have something interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>to announce in a few months that's at </v>

459
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.430
<v Speaker 2>least an order of magnitude better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything else.</v>

460
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.060
<v Speaker 2>Probably I think better than anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks is possible.</v>

461
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:24.830
<v Speaker 2>How much can you talk about that right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

462
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to jump the gun on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

463
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.920
<v Speaker 2>but what's like the ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

464
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:36.100
<v Speaker 2>what's the idea behind it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you trying to accomplish </v>

465
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.591
<v Speaker 2>with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what would you like best case </v>

466
00:25:38.591 --> 00:25:40.631
<v Speaker 2>scenario?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think best case scenario we </v>

467
00:25:40.631 --> 00:25:45.400
<v Speaker 2>effectively merge with ai where we ais </v>
<v Speaker 2>serves as a tertiary cognition layer </v>

468
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:53.120
<v Speaker 2>where we've got the limbic system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of the primitive brain.</v>

469
00:25:53.121 --> 00:25:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got the Cortex,</v>

470
00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:00.140
<v Speaker 2>so you're currently in a symbiotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with your cortex and limbic</v>

471
00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:05.141
<v Speaker 2>system are in a symbiotic relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>and generally people like their cortex </v>

472
00:26:05.141 --> 00:26:07.550
<v Speaker 2>and they liked the limbic system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't met anyone who wants to delete</v>

473
00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.320
<v Speaker 2>their limbic system or delete their </v>
<v Speaker 2>cortex.</v>

474
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Everybody seems to have like both and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cortex is mostly in service to the </v>

475
00:26:15.621 --> 00:26:19.090
<v Speaker 2>limbic system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People may think that that,</v>

476
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.040
<v Speaker 2>that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're thinking part of themselves</v>

477
00:26:22.041 --> 00:26:27.041
<v Speaker 2>isn't charged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's mostly their limbic system </v>

478
00:26:27.041 --> 00:26:28.310
<v Speaker 2>that's in charge and the cortex is </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to make the limbic system happy.</v>

479
00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.610
<v Speaker 2>That's what most of that computing power</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

480
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.810
<v Speaker 2>aren't towards how can I make the limbic</v>
<v Speaker 2>system happy?</v>

481
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.050
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

482
00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:43.770
<v Speaker 2>If we do have a third layer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the ai extension yourself,</v>

483
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.010
<v Speaker 2>that is also some biotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

484
00:26:47.011 --> 00:26:52.011
<v Speaker 2>and there's enough bandwidth between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cortex and the ai extension of yourself </v>

485
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:56.880
<v Speaker 2>such that the ai doesn't defacto </v>
<v Speaker 2>separate,</v>

486
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:03.110
<v Speaker 2>then that could be a good outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be quite a positive outcome </v>

487
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.100
<v Speaker 2>for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead of replacing us,</v>

488
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.680
<v Speaker 2>it will radically change our </v>
<v Speaker 2>capabilities.</v>

489
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will.</v>

490
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:14.630
<v Speaker 2>It will enable anyone who wants to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>super human cognition.</v>

491
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who wants this is not a matter of</v>
<v Speaker 2>earning power because you're earning </v>

492
00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:25.580
<v Speaker 2>power would be vastly greater after you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

493
00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:30.670
<v Speaker 2>So it's just like anyone who wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>can just do it in theory.</v>

494
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

495
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:39.630
<v Speaker 2>and if that's the case then and let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>say billions of people do it,</v>

496
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
<v Speaker 2>then the outcome for humanity will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sum of,</v>

497
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:53.590
<v Speaker 2>of human will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of billions of people's desire for </v>

498
00:27:54.051 --> 00:27:59.051
<v Speaker 2>the future and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Koreans have people with enhanced </v>

499
00:27:59.051 --> 00:28:00.790
<v Speaker 2>cognitive ability radically enhance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

500
00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:05.540
<v Speaker 2>And which would be at how much different</v>
<v Speaker 2>than people today.</v>

501
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had to explain it to a person who</v>

502
00:28:10.881 --> 00:28:12.300
<v Speaker 2>didn't really know or understand what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were saying,</v>

503
00:28:12.301 --> 00:28:16.070
<v Speaker 2>like how much different are you talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about when you say radically improved?</v>

504
00:28:16.071 --> 00:28:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you mean?</v>

505
00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:23.910
<v Speaker 2>You mean mine read or difficult?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be difficult to really </v>

506
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:24.350
<v Speaker 2>appreciate the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

507
00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.360
<v Speaker 2>it was kind like how much smarter are </v>
<v Speaker 2>you with a phone or computer than </v>

508
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:31.360
<v Speaker 2>without?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

509
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.950
<v Speaker 2>you're vastly smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

510
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:36.040
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can answer any question.</v>

511
00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.060
<v Speaker 2>If you're connected to the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can ask her any question pretty much</v>

512
00:28:40.061 --> 00:28:41.950
<v Speaker 2>instantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any calculation,</v>

513
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:42.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

514
00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:45.370
<v Speaker 2>that your phone's memory is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

515
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can remember flawlessly or put your </v>

516
00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:50.810
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can remember videos,</v>

517
00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:55.150
<v Speaker 2>pictures and everything perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

518
00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:58.150
<v Speaker 2>that your phone is already an extension </v>
<v Speaker 2>of you.</v>

519
00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:03.600
<v Speaker 2>You're already a Cyborg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even what most people don't </v>

520
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.451
<v Speaker 2>realize they are already a Cyborg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that phone is an extension of </v>

521
00:29:06.461 --> 00:29:10.670
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that the data rate,</v>

522
00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:16.170
<v Speaker 2>the rate at which was communication rate</v>
<v Speaker 2>between you and the cybernetic extension</v>

523
00:29:16.271 --> 00:29:19.780
<v Speaker 2>of yourself that is your phone and </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer is slow.</v>

524
00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:24.810
<v Speaker 2>It's very slow and that that has like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny straw of,</v>

525
00:29:27.501 --> 00:29:32.501
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of information flow between your </v>

526
00:29:32.501 --> 00:29:35.431
<v Speaker 2>biological self and your digital self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we need to make that tiny stroll </v>

527
00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:41.860
<v Speaker 2>like a giant river,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge high bandwidth interface,</v>

528
00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:43.810
<v Speaker 2>interface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

529
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.250
<v Speaker 2>data rate problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>solve the data rate problem.</v>

530
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:54.500
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we can hang onto human machine </v>

531
00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:59.401
<v Speaker 2>symbiosis through the longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people may decide that they </v>

532
00:30:00.851 --> 00:30:02.770
<v Speaker 2>want to retain their biological self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not,</v>

533
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.090
<v Speaker 2>I think they'll probably choose to </v>
<v Speaker 2>retain their biological self</v>

534
00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:12.860
<v Speaker 4>versus some sort of Ray Kurzweil </v>
<v Speaker 4>scenario where they download themselves </v>

535
00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:12.860
<v Speaker 4>into a computer.</v>

536
00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.140
<v Speaker 2>You will be essentially snapshot it into</v>
<v Speaker 2>a computer at any time.</v>

537
00:30:15.141 --> 00:30:18.560
<v Speaker 2>If your biological self dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just probably just upload into</v>

538
00:30:18.561 --> 00:30:21.440
<v Speaker 2>a new unit that's really</v>

539
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:25.050
<v Speaker 4>pass that whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're getting crazy over here.</v>

540
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.440
<v Speaker 4>Kind of ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Down the rabbit hole.</v>

541
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.370
<v Speaker 4>Grab that software.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you tell me that this is too freaky?</v>

542
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.340
<v Speaker 4>See if I've been thinking about this for</v>
<v Speaker 4>a long time.</v>

543
00:30:35.341 --> 00:30:40.341
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe if I was talking to one more </v>

544
00:30:40.341 --> 00:30:40.341
<v Speaker 4>cheers by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cherished.</v>

545
00:30:40.341 --> 00:30:40.341
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a great whiskey.</v>

546
00:30:40.341 --> 00:30:43.710
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know where this came from.</v>

547
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.690
<v Speaker 4>Who brought this to us?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trying to remember it.</v>

548
00:30:45.691 --> 00:30:47.820
<v Speaker 4>Somebody gave it to us old camp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoever it was.</v>

549
00:30:47.821 --> 00:30:48.720
<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

550
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:49.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is good.</v>

551
00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.860
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just inevitable.</v>

552
00:30:52.861 --> 00:30:54.120
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going back to your,</v>

553
00:30:54.121 --> 00:30:56.870
<v Speaker 4>when you decided to have this fatalistic</v>
<v Speaker 4>view points,</v>

554
00:30:56.871 --> 00:30:58.710
<v Speaker 4>so you weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you tried to warn people.</v>

555
00:30:58.711 --> 00:31:00.810
<v Speaker 4>You talked about this pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>extensively.</v>

556
00:31:00.811 --> 00:31:03.660
<v Speaker 4>I've read several interviews where he </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked about this and then you just sort</v>

557
00:31:03.661 --> 00:31:04.290
<v Speaker 4>of just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

558
00:31:04.291 --> 00:31:07.440
<v Speaker 4>just is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just end you in a way.</v>

559
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:12.500
<v Speaker 4>You're by communicating the potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean for sure you're getting the </v>

560
00:31:13.261 --> 00:31:14.610
<v Speaker 4>warning out to some people.</v>

561
00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

562
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:22.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was really going on the warning</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite,</v>

563
00:31:22.901 --> 00:31:27.901
<v Speaker 2>quite a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering everyone I could you </v>

564
00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.620
<v Speaker 2>ever met with Obama and just put one </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason look at?</v>

565
00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what did he say?</v>

566
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.290
<v Speaker 2>So what about Hillary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worry about her first.</v>

567
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.340
<v Speaker 2>She didn't know he listened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He certainly listened.</v>

568
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met with Congress.</v>

569
00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:50.940
<v Speaker 2>I met with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at a meeting of old 50 governors </v>

570
00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:57.030
<v Speaker 2>and talked about just a ai danger and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to everyone I could.</v>

571
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.970
<v Speaker 2>No one seemed to realize where this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

572
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:10.380
<v Speaker 4>Is it that or do they just assume that </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone smarter than them is already </v>

573
00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:10.950
<v Speaker 4>taken care of it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because when,</v>

574
00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.460
<v Speaker 4>when people hear about something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ai,</v>

575
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:15.130
<v Speaker 4>it's almost abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost,</v>

576
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:20.430
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to wrap your head around </v>

577
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:20.430
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the time it already happens,</v>

578
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:20.500
<v Speaker 4>it will be too late.</v>

579
00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they didn't quite understand it </v>

580
00:32:27.331 --> 00:32:32.331
<v Speaker 2>or didn't think it was near term or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure what to do about it.</v>

581
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.340
<v Speaker 2>I said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

582
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:39.350
<v Speaker 2>an obvious thing to do is to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>establish a committee governance</v>

583
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.650
<v Speaker 1>committee to gain insight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

584
00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.050
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you oversight,</v>

585
00:32:45.051 --> 00:32:50.051
<v Speaker 1>before you do make regulations they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should like try to understand what's </v>

586
00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:52.700
<v Speaker 1>going on and then if you have an insight</v>
<v Speaker 1>committee</v>

587
00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:54.370
<v Speaker 6>then the,</v>

588
00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:57.210
<v Speaker 1>once they learn what's going on and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to speed,</v>

589
00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:02.670
<v Speaker 1>then they can make maybe some roles for </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposed some rules and,</v>

590
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:07.500
<v Speaker 1>and that would be probably a safer way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go about things it seems.</v>

591
00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:12.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know that it's probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that the government supposed </v>

592
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.090
<v Speaker 1>to handle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like I wouldn't want the.</v>

593
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't want the government to handle </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

594
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you want to have one you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>handle?</v>

595
00:33:17.011 --> 00:33:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

596
00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.300
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you're the one who could </v>
<v Speaker 1>ring the bell better because if,</v>

597
00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.460
<v Speaker 1>if Mike pence starts talking about Ai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

598
00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:25.740
<v Speaker 1>shut up bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know anything about Ai.</v>

599
00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

600
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:28.700
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's talking about anything,</v>

601
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.110
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have the power to regulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>other companies.</v>

602
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.230
<v Speaker 1>What am I supposed to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe companies could agree.</v>

603
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Maybe good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There could be some sort of a way.</v>

604
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:41.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have agreements where you're not </v>

605
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.230
<v Speaker 1>supposed to dump toxic waste into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>

606
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:42.900
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to do certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

607
00:33:42.901 --> 00:33:46.920
<v Speaker 1>It could be terribly damaging even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though there'll be profitable.</v>

608
00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should realize that you can't </v>

609
00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.011
<v Speaker 1>hit the switch on something that's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to think for itself and make </v>

610
00:33:55.011 --> 00:33:58.011
<v Speaker 1>up its own mind as to whether or not it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to survive or not and whether or </v>

611
00:33:58.011 --> 00:33:58.011
<v Speaker 1>not it thinks you were a threat</v>

612
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:00.260
<v Speaker 1>and whether or not it thinks you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>useless.</v>

613
00:34:00.261 --> 00:34:05.261
<v Speaker 1>Like why do I keep this dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finite life form alive?</v>

614
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why keep this thing around?</v>

615
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:09.910
<v Speaker 1>It's just stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just keeps polluting everything she</v>

616
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.850
<v Speaker 1>ever wear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Co's,</v>

617
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.340
<v Speaker 1>lighting everything on fire and shooting</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

618
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Why would I keep this stupid thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive?</v>

619
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Because sometimes it makes good music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

620
00:34:17.511 --> 00:34:22.511
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it makes great movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it makes beautiful art and </v>

621
00:34:22.511 --> 00:34:25.541
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's cool to hang out with my </v>

622
00:34:25.541 --> 00:34:26.210
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For us,</v>

623
00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.760
<v Speaker 1>those are great reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for anything objective,</v>

624
00:34:28.761 --> 00:34:29.720
<v Speaker 1>standing outside like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

625
00:34:29.721 --> 00:34:34.721
<v Speaker 1>this is definitely a flawed system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like if you went to the jungle </v>

626
00:34:34.721 --> 00:34:36.050
<v Speaker 1>and you watch these chimps engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>warfare and beat each other with sticks,</v>

627
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:38.350
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking really fucking mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real.</v>

628
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.590
<v Speaker 1>So that movie chimpanzee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

629
00:34:39.591 --> 00:34:40.640
<v Speaker 1>that was gonna be like some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's anything.</v>

630
00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy cow,</v>

631
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.680
<v Speaker 1>what movie was that?</v>

632
00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.120
<v Speaker 1>It looks really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chimpanzee,</v>

633
00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.470
<v Speaker 1>who is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A documentary?</v>

634
00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

635
00:34:46.431 --> 00:34:48.050
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like a documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

636
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.690
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these chimps are mean.</v>

637
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.020
<v Speaker 1>They're mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're cruel.</v>

638
00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:55.730
<v Speaker 1>They're calculated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

639
00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sneak up on each other and like,</v>

640
00:34:58.281 --> 00:35:01.070
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize chimps did calculator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cruelty.</v>

641
00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty left that meeting.</v>

642
00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Kind of like game over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is dark,</v>

643
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

644
00:35:07.671 --> 00:35:11.330
<v Speaker 1>we know better because we've advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we hadn't,</v>

645
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:12.500
<v Speaker 1>we'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

646
00:35:12.501 --> 00:35:15.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fucking live in a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the champ ways,</v>

647
00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.910
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chimp ways to go.</v>

648
00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.170
<v Speaker 1>This is it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chimp life right now,</v>

649
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:25.850
<v Speaker 1>but we in a way to the AI might be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>those chimps,</v>

650
00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:31.120
<v Speaker 1>like these stupid Fox launching missiles</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of drones and shooting each other </v>

651
00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.570
<v Speaker 1>underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're crazy.</v>

652
00:35:32.571 --> 00:35:37.571
<v Speaker 1>We got torpedoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>submarines and fucking airplanes that </v>

653
00:35:37.571 --> 00:35:42.141
<v Speaker 1>drop nuclear bombs indiscriminately on </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities were assholes too.</v>

654
00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might go,</v>

655
00:35:44.581 --> 00:35:46.740
<v Speaker 1>why are they doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might like,</v>

656
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:51.770
<v Speaker 1>look at our politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at what we do in terms of our food </v>

657
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:56.451
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of food we forced down each </v>

658
00:35:56.451 --> 00:35:56.760
<v Speaker 1>other's throats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they might go this.</v>

659
00:35:56.761 --> 00:35:58.830
<v Speaker 1>These people are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't even look out for themselves.</v>

660
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much do we think about chimps?</v>

661
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Not much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very little.</v>

662
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:08.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like these chimps are at war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look like groups of chimps just </v>

663
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:14.340
<v Speaker 1>attack each other and they kill each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and they torture each other.</v>

664
00:36:14.341 --> 00:36:16.350
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

665
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:21.410
<v Speaker 1>they hunt monkeys there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

666
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.070
<v Speaker 1>this is probably the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

667
00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when's the last time we talked about </v>

668
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.280
<v Speaker 1>chimps but me all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do talk to the podcast episode,</v>

669
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.020
<v Speaker 1>people are laughing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

670
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:38.400
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm obsessed.</v>

671
00:36:38.401 --> 00:36:43.401
<v Speaker 1>I saw that David attenborough </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary on Champs when they were </v>

672
00:36:43.401 --> 00:36:44.550
<v Speaker 1>eating those calibus monkeys and ripping</v>
<v Speaker 1>them apart that many,</v>

673
00:36:44.551 --> 00:36:46.860
<v Speaker 1>many years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just changed how I go,</v>

674
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why people are so crazy.</v>

675
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:51.090
<v Speaker 1>We came from that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

676
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.030
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

677
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a better philosophy.</v>

678
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like swingers.</v>

679
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really are.</v>

680
00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:02.730
<v Speaker 1>They're they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem to be way more even than us.</v>

681
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Way More civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just seemed to resolve everything </v>

682
00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:12.621
<v Speaker 1>with sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only rules they have as the mom </v>

683
00:37:12.621 --> 00:37:12.621
<v Speaker 1>won't bang the Sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

684
00:37:12.621 --> 00:37:12.621
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

685
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll bring your sons.</v>

686
00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.760
<v Speaker 1>They're good women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good women in the community.</v>

687
00:37:17.761 --> 00:37:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else is banging it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

688
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:22.140
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen the Lenovo movie.</v>

689
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're disturbing just at a zoo.</v>

690
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Benobos at the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just constantly going constantly.</v>

691
00:37:28.681 --> 00:37:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Fucking boring stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

692
00:37:32.121 --> 00:37:33.060
<v Speaker 1>and they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gay,</v>

693
00:37:33.061 --> 00:37:33.900
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

694
00:37:33.901 --> 00:37:38.901
<v Speaker 1>Let's just fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen was at a zoo s probably </v>

695
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:42.440
<v Speaker 1>like the PGA section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

696
00:37:42.441 --> 00:37:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they have them at many </v>
<v Speaker 1>zoos.</v>

697
00:37:43.981 --> 00:37:46.850
<v Speaker 1>We've looked at it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was probably pretty awkward.</v>

698
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:51.950
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the thing that they like </v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep regular chimps at zoos because </v>

699
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Benomo was just always jacking off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that they have in San Diego has </v>

700
00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.700
<v Speaker 1>got some really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably separate them.</v>

701
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.550
<v Speaker 1>How many other in a cage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be pretty intense.</v>

702
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.530
<v Speaker 1>We'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

703
00:38:04.531 --> 00:38:06.120
<v Speaker 1>we're were a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

704
00:38:06.121 --> 00:38:08.520
<v Speaker 1>and I've often wondered if whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not we're,</v>

705
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:13.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our ultimate goal is to give birth to </v>

706
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:15.450
<v Speaker 1>some new thing and that that's why we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obsessed with technology because it's</v>

707
00:38:15.451 --> 00:38:20.451
<v Speaker 1>not like this technology is really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's certainly enhancing our </v>

708
00:38:20.451 --> 00:38:23.601
<v Speaker 1>lives to in a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean ultimately is it making </v>

709
00:38:23.971 --> 00:38:27.780
<v Speaker 1>people happier right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most technology I would say no.</v>

710
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:32.990
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I were talking about social </v>

711
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:34.851
<v Speaker 1>media before this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about just not having instagram on your </v>

712
00:38:34.851 --> 00:38:35.130
<v Speaker 1>phone and not dealing with you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

713
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

714
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:41.100
<v Speaker 2>I think that one of the issues with </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media that's been pointed out by </v>

715
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.790
<v Speaker 2>many people is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

716
00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:47.460
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe particularly instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

717
00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:52.600
<v Speaker 2>people look like they have a much better</v>
<v Speaker 2>life than they really do.</v>

718
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by design.</v>

719
00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are posting pictures of when they</v>

720
00:38:57.331 --> 00:39:02.331
<v Speaker 2>were really happy there are modifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>those pictures to be better looking if </v>

721
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:04.000
<v Speaker 2>they're not modifying the pictures </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

722
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:06.340
<v Speaker 2>at least selecting the pictures for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best lighting,</v>

723
00:39:06.341 --> 00:39:11.341
<v Speaker 2>the best angle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people basically seem I'll,</v>

724
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.740
<v Speaker 2>they're way better looking than they </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically really are.</v>

725
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:20.560
<v Speaker 2>And they're way happier seeming than </v>
<v Speaker 2>they really are.</v>

726
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.500
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at everyone on Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>

727
00:39:23.501 --> 00:39:25.450
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're always happy,</v>

728
00:39:25.451 --> 00:39:30.130
<v Speaker 2>beautiful people and I'm not that good </v>
<v Speaker 2>login and I am not happy,</v>

729
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.260
<v Speaker 2>so I must suck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

730
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:37.470
<v Speaker 2>And that's gonna make people sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when in fact those people you think </v>

731
00:39:39.071 --> 00:39:41.620
<v Speaker 2>are super happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually not that happy.</v>

732
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.350
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are really depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very sad.</v>

733
00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:50.170
<v Speaker 2>So my happiest people actually some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the saddest people in reality.</v>

734
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

735
00:39:53.311 --> 00:39:55.100
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nobody looks good all the time.</v>

736
00:39:55.101 --> 00:39:56.590
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

737
00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:02.610
<v Speaker 2>it's not even something you should want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you want to look great all the </v>

738
00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:02.610
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

739
00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:03.580
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

740
00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think,</v>

741
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.740
<v Speaker 2>I think things like that can make people</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite sad when you just,</v>

742
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:10.300
<v Speaker 2>just by comparison because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just sort of,</v>

743
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:15.310
<v Speaker 2>you people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people generally think of themselves </v>

744
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:15.910
<v Speaker 2>relative to others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

745
00:40:15.911 --> 00:40:16.240
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

746
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.980
<v Speaker 2>we're constantly re,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we baselining our expectations.</v>

747
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can see the,</v>

748
00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:29.640
<v Speaker 2>if you watch some show like naked and </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid or if you're just going to try </v>

749
00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.360
<v Speaker 2>living in the woods by yourself for </v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile in,</v>

750
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:36.470
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the learn that civilization was </v>

751
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:38.620
<v Speaker 2>quite great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a lot of people want to come back</v>

752
00:40:38.621 --> 00:40:40.750
<v Speaker 2>to civilization pretty fast on naked and</v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid.</v>

753
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:45.870
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't that a thoreau quote?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The comparison is the thief of joy of </v>

754
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.070
<v Speaker 2>happiness is reality minus expectations.</v>

755
00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:56.080
<v Speaker 1>That's great too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the comparison is the thief of joy </v>

756
00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:56.080
<v Speaker 1>really holds true to peep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it they don't.</v>

757
00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt Roosevelt Fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

758
00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.340
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think about instagram,</v>

759
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:06.370
<v Speaker 1>because would essentially instagram is </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of people is you're giving </v>

760
00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:09.131
<v Speaker 1>them the opportunity to be their own pr </v>
<v Speaker 1>agent and they always go towards the </v>

761
00:41:09.171 --> 00:41:10.760
<v Speaker 1>glamorous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

762
00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:14.060
<v Speaker 1>and whenever anybody does show Hashtag </v>
<v Speaker 1>no filter,</v>

763
00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:16.160
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really do do that.</v>

764
00:41:16.161 --> 00:41:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

765
00:41:16.431 --> 00:41:17.360
<v Speaker 1>you're so brave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

766
00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:21.560
<v Speaker 1>you don't make up now they look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

767
00:41:21.561 --> 00:41:22.700
<v Speaker 1>You look great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

768
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have makeup on and still a hot</v>

769
00:41:24.611 --> 00:41:25.670
<v Speaker 1>as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're doing.</v>

770
00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're doing to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

771
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.490
<v Speaker 1>They're letting you know and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feed off that comment section.</v>

772
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a little bit sitting there like,</v>

773
00:41:34.641 --> 00:41:36.740
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fresh stream of love,</v>

774
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:41.800
<v Speaker 1>like you getting right up to the sources</v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes out of the earth and just </v>

775
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:41.800
<v Speaker 1>suck in that water.</v>

776
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Emojis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emojis.</v>

777
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of allergies.</v>

778
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.530
<v Speaker 1>My what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My concern is not so much what instagram</v>

779
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.560
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I didn't think that people had </v>

780
00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.640
<v Speaker 1>the need for this or the expectation for</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of technology that allows them</v>

781
00:41:55.641 --> 00:42:00.641
<v Speaker 1>to constantly get love and adulation </v>
<v Speaker 1>from strangers and comments and this </v>

782
00:42:00.641 --> 00:42:03.650
<v Speaker 1>ability to project this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>distorted version of who you really are,</v>

783
00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:07.100
<v Speaker 1>but I worry about where it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the next one?</v>

784
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:08.730
<v Speaker 1>What's the next one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

785
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.940
<v Speaker 1>where is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to be augmented in some sort</v>

786
00:42:10.941 --> 00:42:15.941
<v Speaker 1>of a weird augmented or virtual sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram type situation where you're </v>

787
00:42:15.941 --> 00:42:17.900
<v Speaker 1>not going to want to live in this real </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

788
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:23.050
<v Speaker 1>you're going to want to interface with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of world that you've created </v>

789
00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:25.010
<v Speaker 1>through your social media page and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>next level thing.</v>

790
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Go live in the simulation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

791
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:32.000
<v Speaker 1>maybe in the simulation ready player one</v>
<v Speaker 1>type shit that's real.</v>

792
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.990
<v Speaker 1>That seems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have that htc vive here and I've only</v>

793
00:42:35.991 --> 00:42:38.420
<v Speaker 1>done it a couple times quite honestly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it kind of freaks me out.</v>

794
00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:40.550
<v Speaker 1>My kids fucking love it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

795
00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:44.520
<v Speaker 1>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love playing these Weirdo Games and</v>

796
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.680
<v Speaker 1>walking around with that headset on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But part of me watching them do it goes,</v>

797
00:42:48.681 --> 00:42:51.530
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if this is like the precursor,</v>

798
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:53.900
<v Speaker 1>just sort of like if you look at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

799
00:42:53.901 --> 00:42:58.901
<v Speaker 1>that Gordon Gekko hat on the beach and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compare that to like a galaxy note nine.</v>

800
00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Like how the fuck did that become that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

801
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.260
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder when I see this htc vive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my,</v>

802
00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:09.580
<v Speaker 1>what is that thing gonna be 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>from now when we're making fun of what </v>

803
00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:09.950
<v Speaker 1>it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

804
00:43:09.951 --> 00:43:10.520
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

805
00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:13.580
<v Speaker 1>how ingrained and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

806
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:18.230
<v Speaker 1>how connected and interconnected is this</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology going to be in our life?</v>

807
00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:26.360
<v Speaker 2>It will be at some point </v>
<v Speaker 2>indistinguishable from reality</v>

808
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.590
<v Speaker 1>where we'll lose this or lose this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you and I just looked at each other</v>

809
00:43:30.591 --> 00:43:32.330
<v Speaker 1>through our eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see you where you see me,</v>

810
00:43:32.331 --> 00:43:33.740
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you think so.</v>

811
00:43:33.741 --> 00:43:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I think you probably have read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regularize.</v>

812
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.540
<v Speaker 1>This could be some simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could.</v>

813
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you entertain that?</v>

814
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:48.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument for the simulation I think </v>

815
00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.271
<v Speaker 2>is quite strong because if you assume </v>
<v Speaker 2>any improvements at all over time,</v>

816
00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.690
<v Speaker 2>any improvement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one percent point one percent.</v>

817
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:58.180
<v Speaker 2>Just extend the timeframe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make it a thousand years,</v>

818
00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:01.000
<v Speaker 2>a million years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Universe is 13 point 8 billion years</v>

819
00:44:01.001 --> 00:44:04.820
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What civilization,</v>

820
00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:07.250
<v Speaker 2>if you counted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're very generous,</v>

821
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:11.060
<v Speaker 2>civilization is maybe seven or 8,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

822
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:14.300
<v Speaker 2>If you counted from the first writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is nothing.</v>

823
00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:19.730
<v Speaker 2>This is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you assume any rate of improvement</v>

824
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:26.530
<v Speaker 2>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then games will be indistinguishable </v>

825
00:44:27.021 --> 00:44:32.021
<v Speaker 2>from reality or civilization</v>

826
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.050
<v Speaker 3>will end one of those two things will </v>
<v Speaker 3>occur.</v>

827
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:39.560
<v Speaker 3>We are most likely in a simulation</v>

828
00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:42.800
<v Speaker 1>or we're on our way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

829
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could most certainly be on the road.</v>

830
00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:48.050
<v Speaker 1>We could be on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did that,</v>

831
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:53.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that it has to face </v>

832
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.470
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be in base reality.</v>

833
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:57.550
<v Speaker 1>We could be here now on our way to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road or on her way to the destination </v>

834
00:44:59.031 --> 00:45:04.031
<v Speaker 1>where this can never happen again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we are completely ingrained in </v>

835
00:45:04.031 --> 00:45:08.891
<v Speaker 1>some sort of an artificial technology or</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a symbiotic relationship </v>

836
00:45:08.891 --> 00:45:11.390
<v Speaker 1>with the internet or the next level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharing information.</v>

837
00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:13.820
<v Speaker 1>But right now we're not there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's possible too,</v>

838
00:45:13.821 --> 00:45:18.821
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that a simulation is one </v>

839
00:45:18.821 --> 00:45:21.911
<v Speaker 1>day going to be inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to have something </v>

840
00:45:21.911 --> 00:45:21.911
<v Speaker 1>that's indistinguishable from regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

841
00:45:21.911 --> 00:45:23.060
<v Speaker 1>but maybe we're not there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also possible.</v>

842
00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:26.770
<v Speaker 1>We're not quite there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That this is real.</v>

843
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:32.520
<v Speaker 1>When I touched that feels very real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why everybody's like </v>

844
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.181
<v Speaker 1>getting to like mason jars and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mason's suede shoes people wear to like </v>

845
00:45:35.181 --> 00:45:37.260
<v Speaker 1>craft restaurants and they wouldn't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>raw wood.</v>

846
00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Everyone says everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See Metal people.</v>

847
00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:44.350
<v Speaker 1>It seems like people are like longing </v>
<v Speaker 1>toward some weird log cabin type.</v>

848
00:45:44.351 --> 00:45:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Nostalgia reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

849
00:45:45.851 --> 00:45:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Like holding on like clinging to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragging their nails through the mud.</v>

850
00:45:49.961 --> 00:45:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Like don't take me a yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then.</v>

851
00:45:53.381 --> 00:45:56.440
<v Speaker 1>But then people will go get a mason jar </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Weinstein or handle</v>

852
00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.270
<v Speaker 3>that's dark.</v>

853
00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Makes me lose faith in humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wind Stamina,</v>

854
00:46:02.301 --> 00:46:03.350
<v Speaker 1>handle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have those.</v>

855
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are just assholes.</v>

856
00:46:06.471 --> 00:46:08.290
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people make pet rocks rough.</v>

857
00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some people are just assholes.</v>

858
00:46:10.101 --> 00:46:11.230
<v Speaker 1>They take advantage of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

859
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.620
<v Speaker 1>our generous nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was made with the Weinstein made with</v>

860
00:46:15.621 --> 00:46:17.960
<v Speaker 1>handle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made it that way.</v>

861
00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:21.780
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto the mace.</v>

862
00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you thought that would be fine if there </v>

863
00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.130
<v Speaker 1>was like glued it on or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was made that way.</v>

864
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:29.300
<v Speaker 1>White trash chic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

865
00:46:29.301 --> 00:46:30.670
<v Speaker 1>this is disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

866
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Here it is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

867
00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.110
<v Speaker 1>This is terrible.</v>

868
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:40.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like fake breasts that are </v>

869
00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.040
<v Speaker 3>designed to be hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like fake breasts from the sixties.</v>

870
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you really long for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones with ripples,</v>

871
00:46:47.581 --> 00:46:48.330
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

872
00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's almost what that is.</v>

873
00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do,</v>

874
00:46:53.031 --> 00:46:54.270
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not nothing.</v>

875
00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:58.220
<v Speaker 3>It's not need to stop certain terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas from propagating.</v>

876
00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

877
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:03.590
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

878
00:47:03.591 --> 00:47:06.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to sound like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like thanks for too dark because I think</v>

879
00:47:06.121 --> 00:47:07.520
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of have to</v>

880
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:13.670
<v Speaker 3>be optimistic about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no point in being pessimistic.</v>

881
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:16.480
<v Speaker 3>It's just too negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does this,</v>

882
00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.230
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

883
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:20.810
<v Speaker 3>I think you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

884
00:47:20.811 --> 00:47:23.840
<v Speaker 3>my theory is like you'd rather be </v>
<v Speaker 3>optimistic.</v>

885
00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.380
<v Speaker 3>I think I'd rather be optimistic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong than pessimistic and.</v>

886
00:47:27.381 --> 00:47:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

887
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:31.000
<v Speaker 3>Police around that side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

888
00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:32.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if,</v>

889
00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:34.390
<v Speaker 3>if you're pessimistic is going to be as </v>
<v Speaker 3>miserable.</v>

890
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

891
00:47:36.921 --> 00:47:38.440
<v Speaker 3>And nobody wants to be around you </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>

892
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:39.520
<v Speaker 3>If it's the end of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

893
00:47:39.521 --> 00:47:40.690
<v Speaker 3>like I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

894
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world's ending.</v>

895
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is what it is.</v>

896
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.460
<v Speaker 3>Enjoy the journey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

897
00:47:48.461 --> 00:47:50.860
<v Speaker 3>If you really want to get morose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

898
00:47:50.861 --> 00:47:55.390
<v Speaker 3>it is what it is for all of us anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were all going to go unless something</v>

899
00:47:55.391 --> 00:47:56.350
<v Speaker 3>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

900
00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

901
00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:01.540
<v Speaker 3>even if we just sort of existed as </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans forever,</v>

902
00:48:01.541 --> 00:48:06.541
<v Speaker 3>we'd be with still eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be like the heat death of the </v>

903
00:48:06.541 --> 00:48:06.541
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

904
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:09.700
<v Speaker 3>Israelian years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now if we get it past the sun,</v>

905
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.180
<v Speaker 3>if we figured out a way past the son </v>
<v Speaker 3>running out of juice,</v>

906
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:16.270
<v Speaker 3>eventually it's going to end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a question of when.</v>

907
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:20.620
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it really is all about the journey or</v>

908
00:48:20.621 --> 00:48:25.621
<v Speaker 3>transcendence from whatever we are now </v>
<v Speaker 3>into something that doesn't worry about </v>

909
00:48:25.621 --> 00:48:25.621
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>

910
00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:32.210
<v Speaker 3>The universe as we know it will </v>
<v Speaker 3>dissipate into a fine mist of cold.</v>

911
00:48:35.011 --> 00:48:40.011
<v Speaker 3>Nothing this eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then someone's going to bottle it </v>

912
00:48:40.011 --> 00:48:42.501
<v Speaker 3>and put a fragrance to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sell it to French people in another </v>

913
00:48:42.501 --> 00:48:43.590
<v Speaker 3>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a very long time.</v>

914
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:48.000
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's really just about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>can we make it last longer.</v>

915
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:51.870
<v Speaker 3>Are you a proponent of the multiuniverse</v>
<v Speaker 3>theory?</v>

916
00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:55.470
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe that there are many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many universes and that even if this one</v>

917
00:48:55.471 --> 00:49:00.471
<v Speaker 3>fades out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's other ones that are </v>

918
00:49:00.471 --> 00:49:00.471
<v Speaker 3>starting fresh right now and there's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite number of them,</v>

919
00:49:00.471 --> 00:49:03.810
<v Speaker 3>they're just constantly in this never </v>
<v Speaker 3>ending cycle of birth and death.</v>

920
00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.880
<v Speaker 3>I think most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just about probability.</v>

921
00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:14.480
<v Speaker 3>There are many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many simulations,</v>

922
00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:19.390
<v Speaker 3>these simulations or we might as well </v>
<v Speaker 3>call them reality or you could call them</v>

923
00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:24.400
<v Speaker 3>the multiverse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These simulations you believe are </v>

924
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.010
<v Speaker 3>created like someone has managed running</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a substrate,</v>

925
00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:29.690
<v Speaker 3>so that substrate is probably boring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boring.</v>

926
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:32.900
<v Speaker 3>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

927
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:36.710
<v Speaker 3>when we create a simulation like a game </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a movie,</v>

928
00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.440
<v Speaker 3>it's a distillation of what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting about life.</v>

929
00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:41.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it,</v>

930
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:46.630
<v Speaker 3>it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can take a year to shoot an action </v>

931
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:48.800
<v Speaker 3>movie and then that's all distilled down</v>
<v Speaker 3>into two or three hours.</v>

932
00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:52.850
<v Speaker 3>So let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you see an action movie being filmed,</v>

933
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.140
<v Speaker 3>frigging boring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super boring takes.</v>

934
00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:00.620
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of takes those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's in a green screen,</v>

935
00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.530
<v Speaker 3>looks pretty goofy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't look cool,</v>

936
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:07.700
<v Speaker 3>but once you add the CGI and have great </v>
<v Speaker 3>editing,</v>

937
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:13.390
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think most likely if we're a </v>

938
00:50:15.861 --> 00:50:20.861
<v Speaker 3>simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really boring outside the </v>

939
00:50:20.861 --> 00:50:23.711
<v Speaker 3>simulation because why would you make </v>
<v Speaker 3>simulation that's boring because it </v>

940
00:50:23.791 --> 00:50:28.030
<v Speaker 3>makes simulation way more interesting in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the base reality that is if this right</v>

941
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:33.030
<v Speaker 1>now is a simulation and ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitably we're,</v>

942
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.480
<v Speaker 1>if as long as we don't die or get hit by</v>
<v Speaker 1>a meteor,</v>

943
00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:40.720
<v Speaker 1>we're going to create some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>simulation if we continue on the same </v>

944
00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.210
<v Speaker 1>technological path we're on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're on right now,</v>

945
00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.380
<v Speaker 1>but we might not be there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it might not be a simulation here,</v>

946
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.850
<v Speaker 1>but it most likely is you feel other </v>
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>

947
00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:56.460
<v Speaker 1>this notion of place or where is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>flawed,</v>

948
00:50:57.490 --> 00:51:00.300
<v Speaker 1>flawed perception like that if you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of,</v>

949
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:06.950
<v Speaker 1>but a vive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which that's made by valve and steam and</v>

950
00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:11.910
<v Speaker 1>it's really valve that made it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>HDC did the hardware,</v>

951
00:51:11.911 --> 00:51:14.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's really evolved thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

952
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:19.230
<v Speaker 1>makers of Halflife yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great company.</v>

953
00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Great Company.</v>

954
00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.320
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

955
00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:27.060
<v Speaker 1>when you're in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that,</v>

956
00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:32.370
<v Speaker 1>in that virtual reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is only going to get better,</v>

957
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:36.810
<v Speaker 1>where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you really?</v>

958
00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You aren't anywhere.</v>

959
00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas in the computer,</v>

960
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:45.390
<v Speaker 1>what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what defines where you are exactly </v>

961
00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:45.600
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your perception is your perceptions</v>

962
00:51:45.601 --> 00:51:47.850
<v Speaker 1>or is it a scale that we have under your</v>
<v Speaker 1>butt.</v>

963
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.440
<v Speaker 1>You right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've measured you.</v>

964
00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.120
<v Speaker 1>You're the same weight as you were when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you left.</v>

965
00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile you're experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you're where you are right </v>

966
00:51:57.830 --> 00:51:57.830
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not be.</v>

967
00:51:57.830 --> 00:52:01.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll spark up a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you keep talking to your manager's </v>

968
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.910
<v Speaker 1>gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come in here.</v>

969
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:02.370
<v Speaker 1>We might have to lock the door right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

970
00:52:02.371 --> 00:52:04.470
<v Speaker 1>You think you're in a studio in la?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard.</v>

971
00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:06.030
<v Speaker 1>You might be in a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

972
00:52:06.031 --> 00:52:06.530
<v Speaker 1>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

973
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:09.960
<v Speaker 1>I think about this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

974
00:52:09.961 --> 00:52:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's unquestionable that one day </v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll be the case.</v>

975
00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.520
<v Speaker 1>As long as we keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as nothing interrupts us,</v>

976
00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:22.550
<v Speaker 1>and if we start from scratch and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know we're single celled organisms all </v>

977
00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:26.160
<v Speaker 1>over again and then millions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of years later would become the</v>

978
00:52:26.161 --> 00:52:31.161
<v Speaker 1>next thing that is us with creativity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ability to change the </v>

979
00:52:31.161 --> 00:52:32.070
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to keep monkeying with things</v>

980
00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:36.030
<v Speaker 1>until it figures out a way to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality to change,</v>

981
00:52:36.031 --> 00:52:41.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean almost like punch a hole through </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this thing into what,</v>

982
00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:46.940
<v Speaker 1>what it wants it to be and create new </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and then those new things will </v>

983
00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:51.171
<v Speaker 1>intersect with other people's new things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it will be this ultimate </v>

984
00:52:51.171 --> 00:52:54.081
<v Speaker 1>pathway of infinite ideas and expression</v>
<v Speaker 1>all through technology.</v>

985
00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:56.380
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

986
00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:02.230
<v Speaker 1>And then we're wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to wonder like why are we </v>

987
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.230
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing?</v>

988
00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

989
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:12.520
<v Speaker 1>I think we should take the actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the set of actions that are most likely </v>

990
00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.630
<v Speaker 1>to make the future better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

991
00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

992
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

993
00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:20.040
<v Speaker 1>And then reevaluate those actions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that they're there.</v>

994
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.690
<v Speaker 1>That it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

995
00:53:21.691 --> 00:53:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a movement to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

996
00:53:23.571 --> 00:53:28.571
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like a social movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some of it's misguided and some </v>

997
00:53:28.571 --> 00:53:32.001
<v Speaker 1>of it's exaggerated and there's a Lotta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people that are fighting for </v>

998
00:53:32.001 --> 00:53:36.021
<v Speaker 1>their side out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like the general trend of </v>

999
00:53:36.021 --> 00:53:40.541
<v Speaker 1>like a social awareness seems to be much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more heightened now than it's ever been </v>

1000
00:53:41.221 --> 00:53:46.221
<v Speaker 1>in any other time in history because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our ability to express ourselves </v>

1001
00:53:46.221 --> 00:53:49.980
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously to each other through </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook or twitter or what have you,</v>

1002
00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:55.580
<v Speaker 1>and that the trend is to abandon </v>
<v Speaker 1>preconceived notions,</v>

1003
00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:59.670
<v Speaker 1>abandoned prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoned discrimination,</v>

1004
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:03.870
<v Speaker 1>and promote kindness and happiness as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much as possible.</v>

1005
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Looking at this knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody gave it to me.</v>

1006
00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck did you do?</v>

1007
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:13.070
<v Speaker 1>My friend Dani.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought this with him and it just </v>

1008
00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:13.070
<v Speaker 1>stayed here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a real Samurai sword.</v>

1009
00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Fun To play with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're into weapons.</v>

1010
00:54:13.831 --> 00:54:16.950
<v Speaker 1>That's from the 15 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Samurais or at the end of the table.</v>

1011
00:54:16.951 --> 00:54:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1012
00:54:17.581 --> 00:54:17.970
<v Speaker 1>I'll grab it.</v>

1013
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.830
<v Speaker 5>Hold on.</v>

1014
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a Legit Samurai sword from an </v>

1015
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.960
<v Speaker 1>actual Samurai from the 15 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you pull out that blade,</v>

1016
00:54:34.961 --> 00:54:39.961
<v Speaker 1>that bleed was made the old way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where a master craftsman folded that </v>

1017
00:54:40.691 --> 00:54:45.691
<v Speaker 1>metal and hammered it down over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>again over a long period of time and </v>

1018
00:54:45.691 --> 00:54:50.341
<v Speaker 1>honed that blade into what it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's crazy is that more than 500 years</v>

1019
00:54:50.711 --> 00:54:52.810
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing is still pristine.</v>

1020
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:59.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever took care of that and pass it </v>

1021
00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:00.170
<v Speaker 1>down to the next person who took care of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and you know,</v>

1022
00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.150
<v Speaker 1>til it got to the podcast room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty fucking crazy.</v>

1023
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One day someone's going to be looking at</v>

1024
00:55:05.731 --> 00:55:10.410
<v Speaker 1>a tesla like that [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking back doors.</v>

1025
00:55:10.411 --> 00:55:15.411
<v Speaker 1>They pop up sideways like a Lamborghini.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should see what tesla can do.</v>

1026
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't.</v>

1027
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.980
<v Speaker 1>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you after driven one.</v>

1028
00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:24.120
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1029
00:55:24.121 --> 00:55:29.121
<v Speaker 1>But most people don't know what it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do in terms of like ludicrous mode in </v>

1030
00:55:29.121 --> 00:55:33.501
<v Speaker 1>terms of like driving super fast and </v>
<v Speaker 1>irresponsibly on public roads is that </v>

1031
00:55:33.501 --> 00:55:33.930
<v Speaker 1>were saying why do you call it can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1032
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can it do that,</v>

1033
00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:42.100
<v Speaker 1>that I need to know about having the </v>
<v Speaker 1>model x can do this like ballet thing to</v>

1034
00:55:42.101 --> 00:55:44.320
<v Speaker 1>the Trans Siberian orchestra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty cool.</v>

1035
00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:49.350
<v Speaker 1>We're at dances if legitimately like </v>
<v Speaker 1>moves you out to that.</v>

1036
00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Why would you program that seemed like </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

1037
00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:58.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what I get about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's weird.</v>

1038
00:55:59.050 --> 00:56:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Like when you showed up here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were all smiles and you pull out a </v>

1039
00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:06.871
<v Speaker 1>fucking blow torch and not a blow torch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like looking at the flame </v>

1040
00:56:06.871 --> 00:56:06.871
<v Speaker 1>thrower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a flame thrower,</v>

1041
00:56:06.871 --> 00:56:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not like you're having </v>

1042
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:14.371
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a like this thing when you </v>

1043
00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:16.210
<v Speaker 1>know your program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a car to do a ballet,</v>

1044
00:56:16.211 --> 00:56:17.740
<v Speaker 1>dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

1045
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:23.290
<v Speaker 1>How do you have the time to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why you're digging </v>

1046
00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:24.170
<v Speaker 1>holes under the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incentive rockets into space and and</v>

1047
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:29.370
<v Speaker 3>power in people in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how the fuck do you have time to </v>

1048
00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:32.200
<v Speaker 3>make the car dance ballet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1049
00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:37.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that case there were some engineers </v>

1050
00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:38.410
<v Speaker 3>at Tesla that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1051
00:56:38.411 --> 00:56:41.470
<v Speaker 3>If we make this car dance and play </v>
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>

1052
00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:43.780
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sounds great.</v>

1053
00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:48.640
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's try to get it done in time.</v>

1054
00:56:48.641 --> 00:56:49.730
<v Speaker 3>For Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did.</v>

1055
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:55.350
<v Speaker 3>Is there a concern about someone just </v>
<v Speaker 3>losing their mind and making do that in </v>

1056
00:56:55.350 --> 00:56:55.900
<v Speaker 3>the highway?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it wouldn't do that.</v>

1057
00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.730
<v Speaker 3>What if it's in bumper to bumper </v>
<v Speaker 3>traffic?</v>

1058
00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:58.870
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1059
00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.400
<v Speaker 3>won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

1060
00:57:00.401 --> 00:57:02.800
<v Speaker 3>It's actually you have to just an Easter</v>
<v Speaker 3>egg.</v>

1061
00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:04.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an Easter egg.</v>

1062
00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:07.080
<v Speaker 3>That's why people don't know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put it here.</v>

1063
00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.430
<v Speaker 3>We'll have the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can do lots of things.</v>

1064
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:11.710
<v Speaker 3>Lots of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once reddit gets a hold of it,</v>

1065
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:13.180
<v Speaker 3>everyone's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1066
00:57:13.181 --> 00:57:16.750
<v Speaker 3>you just have to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you search for it on the Internet,</v>

1067
00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:21.780
<v Speaker 3>you will find out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But people don't know that they should </v>

1068
00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:21.780
<v Speaker 3>even search for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1069
00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:23.050
<v Speaker 3>well they do now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1070
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:26.170
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many things about the model x</v>

1071
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:30.460
<v Speaker 3>and the model s and the model three that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't know about.</v>

1072
00:57:30.461 --> 00:57:35.461
<v Speaker 3>We should probably do a video or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something it and explain it because I </v>

1073
00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:38.410
<v Speaker 3>have close friends of mine and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know the call can do this?</v>

1074
00:57:38.411 --> 00:57:39.370
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>

1075
00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to do a video though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you like the fact that some people </v>

1076
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.750
<v Speaker 3>don't know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1077
00:57:46.751 --> 00:57:49.000
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should tell people.</v>

1078
00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:50.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>

1079
00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:51.370
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would help your product.</v>

1080
00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:57.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like you don't sell enough of </v>

1081
00:57:57.050 --> 00:57:57.050
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sell almost too many of them.</v>

1082
00:57:57.050 --> 00:57:58.630
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

1083
00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:05.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think at Tesla is the most fun </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing you could possibly buy ever.</v>

1084
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:11.180
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's meant to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1085
00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:13.340
<v Speaker 3>our goal is to make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1086
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:19.870
<v Speaker 3>it's not exactly a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually a thing to maximize </v>

1087
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:22.790
<v Speaker 3>enjoyment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make maximum fun.</v>

1088
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:27.950
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Electronic like big screen,</v>

1089
00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:31.220
<v Speaker 3>laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous speed handling,</v>

1090
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:33.620
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1091
00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:38.860
<v Speaker 3>Do you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're going to put video games in </v>

1092
00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:38.860
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are?</v>

1093
00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:38.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this wise?</v>

1094
00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you won't be able to drive while </v>

1095
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:44.320
<v Speaker 3>you're playing the video game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're like,</v>

1096
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.080
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just,</v>

1097
00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:50.380
<v Speaker 3>we're just putting the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Atari emulator rom memory later in </v>

1098
00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:53.261
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'll play missile command and Lunar </v>

1099
00:58:53.261 --> 00:58:53.420
<v Speaker 3>Lander and a bunch of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1100
00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.890
<v Speaker 3>that sounds cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty fun.</v>

1101
00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:56.270
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1102
00:58:56.300 --> 00:59:01.300
<v Speaker 3>And we improved the interface of missile</v>
<v Speaker 3>command because it's too hard with the </v>

1103
00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:03.551
<v Speaker 3>old track bull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the touchscreen version of </v>

1104
00:59:03.551 --> 00:59:04.700
<v Speaker 3>missile command.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have a chance.</v>

1105
00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.440
<v Speaker 3>Do you have an old car?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you?</v>

1106
00:59:09.441 --> 00:59:11.960
<v Speaker 3>Don't you have like an old Jaguar?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1107
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:12.780
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

1108
00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:16.850
<v Speaker 3>That's a 61 series.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Warranty type Jagger.</v>

1109
00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:18.650
<v Speaker 3>I love cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

1110
00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:19.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love old cars.</v>

1111
00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only two,</v>

1112
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:25.580
<v Speaker 3>only two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your gasoline cars I have about that.</v>

1113
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:26.390
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1114
00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:27.680
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

1115
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:33.230
<v Speaker 3>old Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a Ford model t that a friend of </v>

1116
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:35.070
<v Speaker 3>mine gave me my only to gasoline cars is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ford model t all stock.</v>

1117
00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:37.610
<v Speaker 3>Well there's your car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

1118
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.750
<v Speaker 3>look ahead with the convertible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a gorgeous.</v>

1119
00:59:40.751 --> 00:59:43.530
<v Speaker 3>Our God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good looking car.</v>

1120
00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that yours?</v>

1121
00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:48.240
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not mine.</v>

1122
00:59:48.241 --> 00:59:53.241
<v Speaker 3>It's extremely close to mine that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have a front license plate or </v>

1123
00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:53.241
<v Speaker 3>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1124
00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:54.750
<v Speaker 3>that's a beautiful car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They knew that.</v>

1125
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:56.040
<v Speaker 3>That's mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looks like that.</v>

1126
00:59:56.310 --> 00:59:57.390
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They nailed that.</v>

1127
00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:00.090
<v Speaker 3>That's what mine looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very good.</v>

1128
01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:02.020
<v Speaker 3>Is Money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's certain iconic shapes.</v>

1129
01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:03.130
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1130
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:06.380
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about those cars too.</v>

1131
01:00:06.381 --> 01:00:09.920
<v Speaker 1>They're not as capable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not nearly as capable as like a tesla,</v>

1132
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:15.250
<v Speaker 1>but there's something really satisfying </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the mechanical aspect of feeling </v>

1133
01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:18.770
<v Speaker 1>the steering and the grinding of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gears and the shifting.</v>

1134
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:23.320
<v Speaker 1>There's something about those that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely satisfying even though they're</v>

1135
01:00:23.321 --> 01:00:26.380
<v Speaker 1>not that competent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a 19,</v>

1136
01:00:26.381 --> 01:00:31.381
<v Speaker 1>93 porsche nine slash six four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a lightweight.</v>

1137
01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:34.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not as rs America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not very fast.</v>

1138
01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not like in comparison to a tesla </v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that,</v>

1139
01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:40.870
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about it is like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanical feel of everything.</v>

1140
01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:46.300
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives you this weird thrill,</v>

1141
01:00:46.301 --> 01:00:50.560
<v Speaker 3>like you're on this clinky ride and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this feedback.</v>

1142
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:53.060
<v Speaker 3>There's something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1143
01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:53.920
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1144
01:00:55.030 --> 01:01:00.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one type is like basically no </v>

1145
01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:01.270
<v Speaker 3>electronics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just you like that,</v>

1146
01:01:01.271 --> 01:01:04.020
<v Speaker 3>but you also like electronics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1147
01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:09.220
<v Speaker 3>Like your teslas soup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the far end of electronics.</v>

1148
01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:11.170
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drives itself.</v>

1149
01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.740
<v Speaker 3>It's driving itself better every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1150
01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:20.300
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're about to release the </v>
<v Speaker 3>software that will enable you to just </v>

1151
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:22.120
<v Speaker 3>turn it on and it'll drive from highway </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1152
01:01:22.121 --> 01:01:27.121
<v Speaker 3>ramp to a highway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exit through lane changes to overtake </v>

1153
01:01:27.121 --> 01:01:27.670
<v Speaker 3>other cars to go from one interchange </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next.</v>

1154
01:01:27.671 --> 01:01:30.160
<v Speaker 3>If you get on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say the four or five,</v>

1155
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:35.670
<v Speaker 3>get off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get off 300 miles later and go through </v>

1156
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:38.881
<v Speaker 3>several highway interchanges and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>overtake other cars and hook into the </v>

1157
01:01:38.881 --> 01:01:40.860
<v Speaker 3>NAV system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then um,</v>

1158
01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.240
<v Speaker 3>and you just meditating.</v>

1159
01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

1160
01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:49.310
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because just traveling very kind of </v>

1161
01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:51.790
<v Speaker 3>eerie kind of eerie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you think when you saw that </v>

1162
01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:51.870
<v Speaker 3>video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That dude fallen asleep behind the wheel</v>

1163
01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:55.140
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure you've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one in San Francisco is like,</v>

1164
01:01:55.141 --> 01:02:00.141
<v Speaker 3>right outside of San Jose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out cold like this and the car </v>

1165
01:02:00.141 --> 01:02:02.400
<v Speaker 3>interpreter bumper traffic moving along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or have you seen it right?</v>

1166
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1167
01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:08.511
<v Speaker 3>we changed the software.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's I think an old video which has </v>

1168
01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:10.830
<v Speaker 3>software where if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't touch the wheel,</v>

1169
01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:15.570
<v Speaker 3>it will gradually slow down and put the </v>
<v Speaker 3>emergency lights on and wake you up.</v>

1170
01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.860
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's hilarious.</v>

1171
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:20.460
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you choose what voice wakes you up?</v>

1172
01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sort of more of a.</v>

1173
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:26.910
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of honks honking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This should be like wake up fuck face.</v>

1174
01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing your fellow humans.</v>

1175
01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:34.110
<v Speaker 3>We could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could gently wake you up with a </v>

1176
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:34.110
<v Speaker 3>sultry voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1177
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:34.110
<v Speaker 3>that would be good.</v>

1178
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something with a southern accent.</v>

1179
01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.430
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why can't wake up sunshine?</v>

1180
01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.730
<v Speaker 3>Hey Sweetie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1181
01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:40.580
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you wake like,</v>

1182
01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.620
<v Speaker 3>pick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could pick your right like you want.</v>

1183
01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I choose the Australian girl for Siri.</v>

1184
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:46.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take her voice.</v>

1185
01:02:46.921 --> 01:02:49.820
<v Speaker 3>Do you want it to seductive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Favorite Australian?</v>

1186
01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:54.930
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flavor of do what you want it to be </v>

1187
01:02:54.930 --> 01:02:54.930
<v Speaker 3>angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be anything.</v>

1188
01:02:54.930 --> 01:02:54.930
<v Speaker 3>You want those Australian prison lady </v>
<v Speaker 3>genes.</v>

1189
01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.340
<v Speaker 3>Now when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1190
01:02:56.370 --> 01:03:01.370
<v Speaker 3>when you program something like that in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this in response to a concern or is </v>

1191
01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:03.060
<v Speaker 3>it your own?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at it and go,</v>

1192
01:03:03.061 --> 01:03:04.280
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

1193
01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.850
<v Speaker 3>They shouldn't just be able to fall </v>
<v Speaker 3>asleep.</v>

1194
01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:07.320
<v Speaker 3>Wake him up.</v>

1195
01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:09.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1196
01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.710
<v Speaker 3>We like know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>

1197
01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:12.510
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1198
01:03:12.511 --> 01:03:17.511
<v Speaker 3>people falling asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were about to do something about </v>

1199
01:03:17.511 --> 01:03:17.511
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1200
01:03:17.511 --> 01:03:19.020
<v Speaker 3>But when you first released it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't consider it,</v>

1201
01:03:19.021 --> 01:03:19.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just like,</v>

1202
01:03:19.891 --> 01:03:24.540
<v Speaker 3>well no one's going to just sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People fall asleep in cars all the time.</v>

1203
01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.100
<v Speaker 3>Let's crash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1204
01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:27.960
<v Speaker 3>At least our car doesn't crash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's better.</v>

1205
01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:31.650
<v Speaker 3>It's better not to crash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if that God falling asleep in a,</v>

1206
01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:34.560
<v Speaker 3>in a gasoline car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do all the time for sure.</v>

1207
01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:36.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it crashed and somebody.</v>

1208
01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>

1209
01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:42.570
<v Speaker 3>the thing that really got me to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1210
01:03:42.571 --> 01:03:47.571
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we better get on autopilot going get it </v>

1211
01:03:47.571 --> 01:03:49.521
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy who was in an early </v>

1212
01:03:49.521 --> 01:03:52.731
<v Speaker 3>Tesla driving down the highway and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>fell asleep and he ran over a cyclist </v>

1213
01:03:52.731 --> 01:03:55.830
<v Speaker 3>and killed them and cycles like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1214
01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:59.140
<v Speaker 3>if we had the autopilot wouldn't run out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the one.</v>

1215
01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:04.210
<v Speaker 3>He might have fallen asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at least he wouldn't run over that </v>

1216
01:04:04.210 --> 01:04:04.210
<v Speaker 3>cyclist.</v>

1217
01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:09.550
<v Speaker 3>So how did you implement it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like did you just use cameras in </v>

1218
01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:10.790
<v Speaker 3>programmed with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1219
01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:15.110
<v Speaker 3>the system so that if it sees images it </v>
<v Speaker 3>slows down.</v>

1220
01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:20.690
<v Speaker 3>And how much time do you give as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>person who's in control of it allowed to</v>

1221
01:04:20.691 --> 01:04:22.940
<v Speaker 3>program how fast it goes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1222
01:04:23.830 --> 01:04:28.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can program it to be more or less </v>

1223
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:29.420
<v Speaker 3>like more conservative or more </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive driver.</v>

1224
01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:31.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1225
01:04:31.911 --> 01:04:34.360
<v Speaker 3>you can say what speed you want it to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1226
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:35.600
<v Speaker 3>what speed is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1227
01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:37.730
<v Speaker 3>I know you have ludicrous mode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have douchebag mode?</v>

1228
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just cuts people off well for </v>

1229
01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:49.350
<v Speaker 3>four lane changes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's tricky because if you're in like </v>

1230
01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:49.780
<v Speaker 3>La,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in last year,</v>

1231
01:04:49.781 --> 01:04:50.870
<v Speaker 3>pretty aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1232
01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:52.580
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to change lanes sometimes.</v>

1233
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:56.900
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to be sot nom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to be numb day on here in La.</v>

1234
01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:02.180
<v Speaker 3>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to hit that Santa Monica </v>

1235
01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:02.360
<v Speaker 3>Boulevard off ramp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you got to be a little pushy.</v>

1236
01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:03.680
<v Speaker 3>You got to be a little pushy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1237
01:05:03.681 --> 01:05:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're angry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little angry.</v>

1238
01:05:05.991 --> 01:05:08.420
<v Speaker 3>They don't want you in this speed up </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>

1239
01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:13.760
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people like overall a pretty </v>

1240
01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:14.240
<v Speaker 3>nice when the highway even in la,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes they're not.</v>

1241
01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:18.050
<v Speaker 3>Do you think the neurological health </v>
<v Speaker 3>that probably everybody would</v>

1242
01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:21.640
<v Speaker 1>be locked in together as hive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mind tunnels will help it.</v>

1243
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have traffic that'll help</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

1244
01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of those can you put in there?</v>

1245
01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:29.960
<v Speaker 1>That's a nice thing about tunnels as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can go through Edi.</v>

1246
01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>So many levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1247
01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.230
<v Speaker 1>So until you hit hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1248
01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:37.750
<v Speaker 1>but you could go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have 100 levels of tunnel.</v>

1249
01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Their bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1250
01:05:39.671 --> 01:05:42.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be a 99 man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be the 99th,</v>

1251
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:45.430
<v Speaker 1>negative 99 floors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1252
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:49.860
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the fundamental things </v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't appreciate about tunnels is</v>

1253
01:05:49.861 --> 01:05:52.440
<v Speaker 2>that there's not like roads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fundamental issue with roads is that</v>

1254
01:05:52.441 --> 01:05:57.441
<v Speaker 2>you have a tutee transport system and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>three d living in workspace environment.</v>

1255
01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:01.160
<v Speaker 2>So you've got all these tall buildings </v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1256
01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:06.380
<v Speaker 2>or concentrated work environments and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then then you want to go into this </v>

1257
01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:12.080
<v Speaker 2>like tootie transport system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which usually in a pretty low density </v>

1258
01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.660
<v Speaker 2>because cars are spaced out pretty far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1259
01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:19.820
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that obviously is not going to </v>

1260
01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:19.820
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have traffic guaranteed.</v>

1261
01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.990
<v Speaker 2>But if you can go three D on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>transport system,</v>

1262
01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:27.770
<v Speaker 2>then you can solve all traffic and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can either go 3d up with a flying car or</v>

1263
01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:33.610
<v Speaker 2>can go through ed down with tunnels and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have as many tunnel levels as </v>

1264
01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:36.900
<v Speaker 2>you want and you can arbitrarily relieve</v>
<v Speaker 2>any amount of traffic.</v>

1265
01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.770
<v Speaker 2>You can go further down with tunnels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you can go up with buildings.</v>

1266
01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:42.990
<v Speaker 2>You're 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet down if you want.</v>

1267
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't recommend it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what was that movie with?</v>

1268
01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.370
<v Speaker 1>What's his face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Bradley Cooper.</v>

1269
01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Not Bradley Cooper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Christian.</v>

1270
01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Now what the fuck is his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Was Batman?</v>

1271
01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Christian Bale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where he.</v>

1272
01:06:57.930 --> 01:07:02.930
<v Speaker 1>They fought dragons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him and Matthew Mcconaughey went down </v>

1273
01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:03.570
<v Speaker 1>deep into the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How high?</v>

1274
01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.730
<v Speaker 1>How deep can you go up man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1275
01:07:05.731 --> 01:07:07.770
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was meant for dragons.</v>

1276
01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Christian Bale Reign.</v>

1277
01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:11.910
<v Speaker 1>A fire ring of fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never saw that.</v>

1278
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:15.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but good.</v>

1279
01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't recommend saying super far </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1280
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Molten.</v>

1281
01:07:21.450 --> 01:07:22.230
<v Speaker 1>We're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1282
01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Earth is a giant bowl of lava</v>

1283
01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:30.100
<v Speaker 2>with a thin crust on the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we think of as like the surface,</v>

1284
01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:34.570
<v Speaker 2>this thin crust and it's mostly just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big ball of lava</v>

1285
01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:39.410
<v Speaker 1>that's earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 10,000</v>

1286
01:07:39.411 --> 01:07:40.190
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a big deal.</v>

1287
01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Have you given any consideration </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever to the flat Earth Movement </v>

1288
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:48.860
<v Speaker 1>thought?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a troll situation.</v>

1289
01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1290
01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:51.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1291
01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>You would like to think because you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>super genius,</v>

1292
01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:58.580
<v Speaker 1>but I as a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal person,</v>

1293
01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:02.270
<v Speaker 1>I know there's people way dumber than me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they really,</v>

1294
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:07.390
<v Speaker 1>really believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They watch youtube videos which go on </v>

1295
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:11.051
<v Speaker 1>uninterrupted and spew out a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking fake vacs very eloquently and </v>

1296
01:08:11.051 --> 01:08:14.680
<v Speaker 1>articulately and they really believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people.</v>

1297
01:08:14.681 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1298
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:16.820
<v Speaker 3>if it works for them,</v>

1299
01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:17.990
<v Speaker 7>sure,</v>

1300
01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:21.730
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

1301
01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Weird that right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That in this age where you know it was </v>

1302
01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.660
<v Speaker 3>ludicrous mode and your car goes one </v>
<v Speaker 3>point nine seconds.</v>

1303
01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:32.230
<v Speaker 3>Zero to 62 point two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two point two.</v>

1304
01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Which one's one point nine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The poster.</v>

1305
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:36.910
<v Speaker 3>The next generation roadster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certain standard edition.</v>

1306
01:08:36.911 --> 01:08:38.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on top of this shit.</v>

1307
01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:42.820
<v Speaker 3>That's the standard edition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So throughout the performance package,</v>

1308
01:08:42.970 --> 01:08:47.970
<v Speaker 3>what performance package?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck do you need me to put </v>

1309
01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:50.230
<v Speaker 3>rocket thrusters on it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For Real?</v>

1310
01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:54.310
<v Speaker 3>What are they going to burn?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think high ultra high pressure.</v>

1311
01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:56.470
<v Speaker 3>Compressed air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1312
01:08:56.650 --> 01:09:00.340
<v Speaker 3>just cold gas thrusters new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to have air tanks?</v>

1313
01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.000
<v Speaker 3>Are they sucking the air out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1314
01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:03.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just electric pump.</v>

1315
01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.530
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pump it up like 10,000</v>

1316
01:09:05.531 --> 01:09:07.180
<v Speaker 3>PSI.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how fast are we talking?</v>

1317
01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:10.590
<v Speaker 3>Zero to 60.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How fast you want to go to go?</v>

1318
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:15.610
<v Speaker 3>Could make it fly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to go back in time to make it </v>

1319
01:09:15.610 --> 01:09:15.610
<v Speaker 3>fly.</v>

1320
01:09:15.610 --> 01:09:15.610
<v Speaker 3>You make it fly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1321
01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Do you anticipate that as being me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about the tunnels and </v>

1322
01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:23.521
<v Speaker 3>then flying cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you really think that's going to be </v>

1323
01:09:23.521 --> 01:09:25.231
<v Speaker 3>real too noisy and this too much air </v>
<v Speaker 3>flow so that the fundamental issue with </v>

1324
01:09:25.231 --> 01:09:29.821
<v Speaker 3>flying cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I forget what one of those like </v>

1325
01:09:29.821 --> 01:09:30.580
<v Speaker 3>toy drones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think of how much,</v>

1326
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.960
<v Speaker 3>how loud those are and how much air </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1327
01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:39.270
<v Speaker 3>How much air they blow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now imagine if that's like a thousand </v>

1328
01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:42.091
<v Speaker 3>times heavier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not going to be make your </v>

1329
01:09:42.091 --> 01:09:45.391
<v Speaker 3>neighbors happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your neighbors are not going to be </v>

1330
01:09:45.391 --> 01:09:48.241
<v Speaker 3>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you land a flying car in your </v>

1331
01:09:48.241 --> 01:09:49.900
<v Speaker 3>backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be very helicopter or on your </v>

1332
01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:50.110
<v Speaker 3>roof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just really going to be like,</v>

1333
01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:54.310
<v Speaker 3>what the hell that it was annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't even look.</v>

1334
01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.970
<v Speaker 3>If you want a flying car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just put some wheels on a helicopter.</v>

1335
01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:03.540
<v Speaker 3>Is there a way around that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what if they figure out some sort </v>

1336
01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:06.331
<v Speaker 3>of magnetic technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all those Bob Lazard type </v>

1337
01:10:06.331 --> 01:10:09.960
<v Speaker 3>characters were thinking that was a part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the UFO technology they were doing at</v>

1338
01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:11.430
<v Speaker 3>area 51.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>

1339
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:14.500
<v Speaker 3>didn't they have some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some thoughts about magnetics?</v>

1340
01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:16.150
<v Speaker 3>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no bullshit.</v>

1341
01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.370
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1342
01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:22.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a fundamental momentum exchange </v>

1343
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:22.460
<v Speaker 3>with the air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you must.</v>

1344
01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:26.720
<v Speaker 3>You must accelerate your business like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1345
01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.320
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a mess and you have gravity,</v>

1346
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:34.350
<v Speaker 3>gravitational acceleration and mass mass</v>
<v Speaker 3>times your mass times gravity must equal</v>

1347
01:10:37.511 --> 01:10:42.511
<v Speaker 3>the massive air flow times the </v>
<v Speaker 3>acceleration of that f flow to have a </v>

1348
01:10:42.511 --> 01:10:44.140
<v Speaker 3>neutral force,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's impossible to go around and then</v>

1349
01:10:44.141 --> 01:10:49.141
<v Speaker 3>you won't move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If FMG is greater than you will go down </v>

1350
01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:51.400
<v Speaker 3>and if mas greater than mg you will go </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1351
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:54.580
<v Speaker 3>That's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just no way around that.</v>

1352
01:10:54.670 --> 01:10:59.670
<v Speaker 3>There is definitely no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way to create some sort of a </v>

1353
01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:02.881
<v Speaker 3>magnetic something or another that </v>
<v Speaker 3>allows you to technically yes,</v>

1354
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:08.590
<v Speaker 3>you you could have a strong enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>magnet,</v>

1355
01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:16.540
<v Speaker 3>but that magnet would be strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you would create a lot of trouble.</v>

1356
01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.910
<v Speaker 3>We just suck cars up in your car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just pickup.</v>

1357
01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:26.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to repel off of either a </v>

1358
01:11:26.530 --> 01:11:31.250
<v Speaker 3>material on the ground or in a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>nasty situation off of Earth's </v>

1359
01:11:33.781 --> 01:11:37.680
<v Speaker 3>gravitational field and somehow make </v>
<v Speaker 3>that incredibly light,</v>

1360
01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.890
<v Speaker 3>but that magnet would cause so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>destruction.</v>

1361
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:46.010
<v Speaker 3>You'd be better off with a helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if there was some sort of magnet </v>

1362
01:11:46.771 --> 01:11:49.980
<v Speaker 3>road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you have two magnets and they repel</v>

1363
01:11:49.981 --> 01:11:54.981
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had some sort of a magnet road </v>

1364
01:11:54.981 --> 01:11:55.350
<v Speaker 3>that was below you and you could travel </v>
<v Speaker 3>on that magnet road,</v>

1365
01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:56.730
<v Speaker 3>that would work.</v>

1366
01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:02.040
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1367
01:12:02.041 --> 01:12:04.520
<v Speaker 3>You could have a magnet road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a magnet road because that too.</v>

1368
01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1369
01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:07.830
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1370
01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:12.890
<v Speaker 3>I would not recommend it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things I don't </v>

1371
01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:14.130
<v Speaker 3>recommend or not recommend that not </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1372
01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:16.430
<v Speaker 3>Not Wise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think no roads.</v>

1373
01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.420
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no that.</v>

1374
01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:20.940
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely not.</v>

1375
01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.430
<v Speaker 3>Definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was good.</v>

1376
01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:27.440
<v Speaker 3>I would cause a lot of trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've put some time and </v>

1377
01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:27.440
<v Speaker 3>consideration into this other than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1378
01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:31.440
<v Speaker 3>instead of like my foolishly rendered </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts.</v>

1379
01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:33.420
<v Speaker 3>So you think that tunnels of the way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it?</v>

1380
01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll work for sure.</v>

1381
01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:36.030
<v Speaker 3>That'll work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1382
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:39.610
<v Speaker 3>And your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1383
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:41.550
<v Speaker 3>these tunnels that you're building right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1384
01:12:41.551 --> 01:12:46.551
<v Speaker 3>these are basically just like test </v>
<v Speaker 3>versions of this ultimate idea that you </v>

1385
01:12:46.551 --> 01:12:47.370
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1386
01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:49.270
<v Speaker 3>it's just a hole in the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1387
01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:54.240
<v Speaker 3>We played videos of it where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to drop that hole in the ground,</v>

1388
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:56.880
<v Speaker 3>there's a sled on it and the sled goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>very fast.</v>

1389
01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.620
<v Speaker 3>Like 100 miles an hour plus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1390
01:12:58.621 --> 01:13:00.360
<v Speaker 3>you can go real fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fast as you want.</v>

1391
01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:06.710
<v Speaker 3>And then if you want to go long </v>
<v Speaker 3>distances you can just grow the air out </v>

1392
01:13:06.710 --> 01:13:06.720
<v Speaker 3>of the tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure it's real straight.</v>

1393
01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:09.790
<v Speaker 3>Draw the air of the tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1394
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:11.850
<v Speaker 3>So vacuum tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1395
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:15.280
<v Speaker 3>because the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then depending on how fast you wanna</v>

1396
01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:20.290
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can either use wheels or you could </v>

1397
01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:21.720
<v Speaker 3>use air bearings depending upon the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ambient pressure in the tunnel.</v>

1398
01:13:21.721 --> 01:13:25.560
<v Speaker 3>Or You could a maglev it if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go super fast.</v>

1399
01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.610
<v Speaker 3>So magnet road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1400
01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:32.260
<v Speaker 3>but underground magnet roads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>underground magnet,</v>

1401
01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:37.300
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you're going to really create </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of trouble with because those </v>

1402
01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:37.980
<v Speaker 3>metal things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So magnet rose the way to go.</v>

1403
01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:41.130
<v Speaker 3>Just underground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to go really fast?</v>

1404
01:13:41.770 --> 01:13:43.800
<v Speaker 3>Underground?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would be in a,</v>

1405
01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:47.910
<v Speaker 3>you would be maglev in a vacuum tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mag in a vacuum tunnel,</v>

1406
01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:50.040
<v Speaker 3>magnetic levitation in a backroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tunnel entrance.</v>

1407
01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Fun with rocket launchers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I would not recommend putting any </v>

1408
01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.570
<v Speaker 3>exhaust gas in the tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1409
01:13:57.750 --> 01:14:02.750
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying because then </v>

1410
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.750
<v Speaker 3>you have to pump it on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1411
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:05.691
<v Speaker 3>You have to pump it out and you probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a limited amount of air in the </v>

1412
01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:05.691
<v Speaker 3>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how much can you breathe?</v>

1413
01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to pump oxygen into these </v>
<v Speaker 3>cubicles of the pressurized pod and be </v>

1414
01:14:09.970 --> 01:14:11.040
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a little tiny underground.</v>

1415
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 3>Basically</v>

1416
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.330
<v Speaker 2>like an airplane because you have a or </v>
<v Speaker 2>an airplane.</v>

1417
01:14:15.331 --> 01:14:17.170
<v Speaker 2>It's not getting new Aaron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1418
01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:18.190
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1419
01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.100
<v Speaker 2>We have like a little hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1420
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:21.220
<v Speaker 2>they have a pump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1421
01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:22.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets it from the outside.</v>

1422
01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1423
01:14:23.411 --> 01:14:26.690
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the airplanes have it.</v>

1424
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:29.470
<v Speaker 2>Have it easy because essentially you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

1425
01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.620
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty leaky but Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1426
01:14:32.621 --> 01:14:37.621
<v Speaker 2>but so long as they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as the air pump is working at a </v>

1427
01:14:38.081 --> 01:14:39.550
<v Speaker 2>decent speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have backup pumps.</v>

1428
01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Still have like three pumps to four </v>
<v Speaker 2>pumps or something and uh,</v>

1429
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:45.340
<v Speaker 2>and then that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's like,</v>

1430
01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:50.380
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it exhausts through the outflow valve </v>

1431
01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:55.800
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and through whatever seals are not </v>

1432
01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.741
<v Speaker 2>feeling quite right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually the door doesn't feel quite </v>

1433
01:14:58.741 --> 01:15:01.291
<v Speaker 2>right on a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a bit of leakage around the </v>

1434
01:15:01.291 --> 01:15:01.840
<v Speaker 2>door and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1435
01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:06.460
<v Speaker 2>the pumps a exceed the flow rate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then that sets the pressure in the,</v>

1436
01:15:06.461 --> 01:15:07.180
<v Speaker 2>in the cabin.</v>

1437
01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever looked at and gone,</v>

1438
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:15.750
<v Speaker 2>I can fix this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't have time as you make </v>

1439
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:18.490
<v Speaker 2>them a design for a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do a better design.</v>

1440
01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean probably I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1441
01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:27.400
<v Speaker 2>have you talked to about this and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to friends,</v>

1442
01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:29.750
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends and family,</v>

1443
01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:30.760
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriends,</v>

1444
01:15:30.761 --> 01:15:35.590
<v Speaker 2>and you can tell me what do you got?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

1445
01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the exciting thing to do would be</v>

1446
01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:42.220
<v Speaker 2>some sort of electric vertical takeoff </v>
<v Speaker 2>and landing supersonic,</v>

1447
01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:47.820
<v Speaker 2>jet up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of vertical takeoff and </v>

1448
01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:49.351
<v Speaker 2>landing mean no need for runway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just shoot up straight in the air and </v>

1449
01:15:49.351 --> 01:15:49.351
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

1450
01:15:49.351 --> 01:15:49.600
<v Speaker 8>Ooh,</v>

1451
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:55.590
<v Speaker 2>how'd you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they do that and some military </v>

1452
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:56.110
<v Speaker 2>aircrafts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>

1453
01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trick is that you have,</v>

1454
01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:02.690
<v Speaker 2>you have to transition to level flight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you the the,</v>

1455
01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:08.020
<v Speaker 2>the thing that you'd use for vertical </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tafe will take over and landing is not </v>

1456
01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:10.810
<v Speaker 2>suitable for high speed flight,</v>

1457
01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:17.460
<v Speaker 2>so you have two different systems where </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought about this quite a lot.</v>

1458
01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:24.460
<v Speaker 2>The interesting thing about an electric </v>
<v Speaker 2>plane is that you want to go as high as </v>

1459
01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:25.810
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you need a certain energy density in</v>

1460
01:16:25.811 --> 01:16:30.220
<v Speaker 2>the battery pack because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>overcome gravitational potential energy.</v>

1461
01:16:30.221 --> 01:16:35.221
<v Speaker 2>Once you've overcome gravitational </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential energy and you're at at at at </v>

1462
01:16:35.221 --> 01:16:38.431
<v Speaker 2>a high altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the energy use in cruise is very low and</v>

1463
01:16:38.651 --> 01:16:41.050
<v Speaker 2>then you could recapture a large part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1464
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:43.330
<v Speaker 2>the gravitational potential energy on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way down.</v>

1465
01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:47.320
<v Speaker 2>So you really don't need any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reserve fuel,</v>

1466
01:16:47.321 --> 01:16:49.120
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have the,</v>

1467
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:52.060
<v Speaker 2>the energy of height,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gravitational potential energy.</v>

1468
01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:55.000
<v Speaker 2>This is a lot of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1469
01:16:56.150 --> 01:17:01.050
<v Speaker 2>So once you can get high the high you </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the way to think about a plane,</v>

1470
01:17:01.051 --> 01:17:06.051
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a force balance to the force </v>

1471
01:17:06.051 --> 01:17:08.410
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a plane that is not accelerating,</v>

1472
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1473
01:17:09.610 --> 01:17:13.460
<v Speaker 2>is a neutral force balance at the force </v>
<v Speaker 2>of gravity.</v>

1474
01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:18.730
<v Speaker 2>If the lift force with the wings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you've got the force of the one of </v>

1475
01:17:19.071 --> 01:17:24.071
<v Speaker 2>the thrusting device,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the propeller or turbine or whatever </v>

1476
01:17:24.071 --> 01:17:28.721
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've got the resistance force of </v>

1477
01:17:28.721 --> 01:17:29.060
<v Speaker 2>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the higher you go,</v>

1478
01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:31.310
<v Speaker 2>the lower the error assistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1479
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:37.030
<v Speaker 2>air density drops exponentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but drag increases with the square and </v>

1480
01:17:37.221 --> 01:17:39.860
<v Speaker 2>exponential beats of square.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The higher you go,</v>

1481
01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.990
<v Speaker 2>the faster you will go for the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of energy</v>

1482
01:17:43.810 --> 01:17:48.810
<v Speaker 2>and at a certain altitude you can go </v>
<v Speaker 2>supersonic with less energy per mile,</v>

1483
01:17:49.511 --> 01:17:54.190
<v Speaker 2>quite a lot less energy per mile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then an aircraft at 35,000</v>

1484
01:17:54.191 --> 01:17:59.191
<v Speaker 2>feet because it's just a force balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just doing it for this conversation.</v>

1485
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.990
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>

1486
01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:06.470
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it does.</v>

1487
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:11.390
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you think about this new idea of,</v>

1488
01:18:11.391 --> 01:18:12.580
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of designing it,</v>

1489
01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:13.320
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1490
01:18:13.450 --> 01:18:16.040
<v Speaker 4>when you have this idea about improving </v>
<v Speaker 4>planes,</v>

1491
01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:22.020
<v Speaker 4>are you going to bring this to somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>or you just chuck a lot on my plate,</v>

1492
01:18:22.290 --> 01:18:23.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This what I'm saying?</v>

1493
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:27.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how you do what you do now,</v>

1494
01:18:27.211 --> 01:18:31.170
<v Speaker 4>but if you keep coming up with these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's got to be hard to pawn this off</v>

1495
01:18:31.171 --> 01:18:32.110
<v Speaker 4>on someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>either a,</v>

1496
01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.540
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go do a job.</v>

1497
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:38.590
<v Speaker 4>A good job with this vertical takeoff </v>
<v Speaker 4>and landing system that I want to </v>

1498
01:18:38.611 --> 01:18:40.170
<v Speaker 4>implement into regular planes.</v>

1499
01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:44.570
<v Speaker 2>They're playing electric airplane isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily right now.</v>

1500
01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Electric cars are important and we need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to source energy is important.</v>

1501
01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:51.350
<v Speaker 2>Stationary storage of energy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

1502
01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:53.960
<v Speaker 2>These things are much more important </v>
<v Speaker 2>than creating electric supersonic,</v>

1503
01:18:53.961 --> 01:18:56.420
<v Speaker 2>fetal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1504
01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:02.150
<v Speaker 2>the planes naturally you really want </v>
<v Speaker 2>that gravitational energy density for an</v>

1505
01:19:02.151 --> 01:19:03.080
<v Speaker 2>aircraft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1506
01:19:03.081 --> 01:19:08.081
<v Speaker 2>and this is improving over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's important that we accelerate the</v>

1507
01:19:08.461 --> 01:19:12.980
<v Speaker 2>transition to sustainable energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why electric cars and matters,</v>

1508
01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:14.720
<v Speaker 2>whether electric cars happen sooner or </v>
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>

1509
01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:16.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1510
01:19:16.401 --> 01:19:21.401
<v Speaker 2>we're really playing the crazy game here</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the atmosphere or the oceans were </v>

1511
01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:28.310
<v Speaker 2>taking vast amounts of carbon from deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and putting this,</v>

1512
01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.270
<v Speaker 2>putting this neat and the atmosphere was</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

1513
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:37.360
<v Speaker 2>We should not do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very dangerous.</v>

1514
01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.090
<v Speaker 2>So we should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should,</v>

1515
01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.610
<v Speaker 2>we should accelerate the transition to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable energy.</v>

1516
01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:52.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bizarre thing is that obviously </v>

1517
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:53.170
<v Speaker 2>we're going to run out of oil in long </v>
<v Speaker 2>term.</v>

1518
01:19:53.970 --> 01:19:54.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to.</v>

1519
01:19:54.450 --> 01:19:57.090
<v Speaker 2>There's only so much oil we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can mine it burn.</v>

1520
01:19:58.730 --> 01:20:01.500
<v Speaker 2>It's total logical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We must have to sustainable energy,</v>

1521
01:20:01.501 --> 01:20:06.501
<v Speaker 2>transport and energy infrastructure in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the longterm so we know that's the end </v>

1522
01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:06.501
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that.</v>

1523
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:12.080
<v Speaker 2>So why I run this crazy experiment where</v>
<v Speaker 2>we take trillions of tons of carbon from</v>

1524
01:20:12.121 --> 01:20:15.000
<v Speaker 2>underground and put it in the atmosphere</v>
<v Speaker 2>and oceans.</v>

1525
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:20.030
<v Speaker 2>This isn't insane experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the dumbest experiment in human </v>

1526
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:22.270
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are we doing this?</v>

1527
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:23.140
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1528
01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:30.560
<v Speaker 4>Do you think this is a product of </v>
<v Speaker 4>momentum that we started off doing this </v>

1529
01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:33.981
<v Speaker 4>when it was just a few engines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a few hundred million gallons of fuel </v>

1530
01:20:33.991 --> 01:20:38.991
<v Speaker 4>over the whole world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not that big of a deal and then slowly </v>

1531
01:20:38.991 --> 01:20:41.940
<v Speaker 4>but surely over a century it got out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>control and now it it.</v>

1532
01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:47.120
<v Speaker 4>It's not just our fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also the fossil fuels are </v>

1533
01:20:48.871 --> 01:20:51.180
<v Speaker 4>involved in so many different </v>
<v Speaker 4>electronics,</v>

1534
01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:56.480
<v Speaker 4>so many different items that people buy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just this constant desire for </v>

1535
01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.560
<v Speaker 4>fossil fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>constant need for oil,</v>

1536
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:04.190
<v Speaker 2>without consideration of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainability thing is like oil,</v>

1537
01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:05.300
<v Speaker 2>oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coal,</v>

1538
01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:08.180
<v Speaker 2>gas will the easy money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easy money.</v>

1539
01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:12.750
<v Speaker 2>So have you heard about clean coal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The president's been tweeting about.</v>

1540
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:15.050
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be real clean coal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All caps.</v>

1541
01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.680
<v Speaker 2>Did you see he used all caps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean coal.</v>

1542
01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:20.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1543
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:28.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to put that CEO to </v>

1544
01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:28.700
<v Speaker 2>back in the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't like being in solid form.</v>

1545
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:31.580
<v Speaker 2>Have you thought about energy like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some sort of a filter,</v>

1546
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:35.390
<v Speaker 2>giant building sized filter socks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbon out of the atmosphere.</v>

1547
01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1548
01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:39.110
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't talk possible.</v>

1549
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.980
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

1550
01:21:39.981 --> 01:21:40.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nope.</v>

1551
01:21:40.611 --> 01:21:42.790
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1552
01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.570
<v Speaker 2>we're not fucked.</v>

1553
01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:50.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a quite a complex question,</v>

1554
01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:53.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1555
01:21:53.331 --> 01:21:58.331
<v Speaker 2>we're really just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the more carbon we take out of the </v>

1556
01:21:58.331 --> 01:22:02.411
<v Speaker 2>ground and add to the atmosphere and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of it gets permeated into the </v>

1557
01:22:02.411 --> 01:22:04.280
<v Speaker 2>oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more dangerous it is.</v>

1558
01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't think right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're okay right now.</v>

1559
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:13.990
<v Speaker 2>We can probably even add some more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the momentum towards sustainable </v>

1560
01:22:14.301 --> 01:22:19.301
<v Speaker 2>energy is too slow like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a vast base of industry,</v>

1561
01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:26.620
<v Speaker 2>vast transportation system like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this two and a half billion cars and </v>

1562
01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:28.640
<v Speaker 2>trucks in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and,</v>

1563
01:22:28.650 --> 01:22:29.300
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

1564
01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:32.930
<v Speaker 2>the new car and truck production.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was 100 percent electric,</v>

1565
01:22:33.530 --> 01:22:38.210
<v Speaker 2>that's only about $100 million per year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it would take,</v>

1566
01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:43.300
<v Speaker 2>if you could snap your fingers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>instantly turn all old cars and trucks,</v>

1567
01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:50.200
<v Speaker 2>electric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would still take 25 years to change </v>

1568
01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:50.200
<v Speaker 2>the transport based to electric.</v>

1569
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Makes sense because how long does it </v>
<v Speaker 2>truck car truck last before it goes into</v>

1570
01:22:56.121 --> 01:22:59.060
<v Speaker 2>the junkyard and gets crushed about 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>to 25 years.</v>

1571
01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Is there a way to accelerate that </v>
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>

1572
01:23:01.911 --> 01:23:06.911
<v Speaker 2>like some sort of subsidies or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>encouragement from the government </v>

1573
01:23:06.911 --> 01:23:09.100
<v Speaker 2>financially?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1574
01:23:09.230 --> 01:23:14.230
<v Speaker 2>the thing that is going on right now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is an inherit subsidy in any </v>

1575
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:16.600
<v Speaker 2>oil burning device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any,</v>

1576
01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:21.630
<v Speaker 2>any power plant or car is fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>a consuming the carbon capacity of the </v>

1577
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:28.600
<v Speaker 2>oceans and atmosphere or just say </v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere for short.</v>

1578
01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like you can say like,</v>

1579
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:35.550
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain probability of </v>

1580
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:39.121
<v Speaker 2>something bad happening past a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbon concentration in the atmosphere,</v>

1581
01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:46.080
<v Speaker 2>and so there's some uncertain number </v>
<v Speaker 2>where if we put too much carbon in the </v>

1582
01:23:46.631 --> 01:23:48.490
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things overheat,</v>

1583
01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:53.410
<v Speaker 2>a oceans warm up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ice caps melt,</v>

1584
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:59.130
<v Speaker 2>ocean real estate becomes a lot less </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable underwater.</v>

1585
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:03.220
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not clear what that number is,</v>

1586
01:24:03.221 --> 01:24:05.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's definitely a scientists with </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

1587
01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:10.310
<v Speaker 2>It's really quite the scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The scientific consensus is </v>

1588
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:13.900
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm overwhelming.</v>

1589
01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:17.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know any serious scientists,</v>

1590
01:24:17.021 --> 01:24:20.840
<v Speaker 2>actually zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally zero who don't think that,</v>

1591
01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:22.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1592
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:27.670
<v Speaker 2>But we have quite a serious climate risk</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're facing.</v>

1593
01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:33.300
<v Speaker 2>And so that's fundamentally a subsidy </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurring with every fossil fuel burning</v>

1594
01:24:37.061 --> 01:24:42.061
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>power plants per aircraft car.</v>

1595
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:44.710
<v Speaker 2>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even rockets rockets use,</v>

1596
01:24:44.711 --> 01:24:45.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1597
01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:46.990
<v Speaker 2>they burn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they burn fuel,</v>

1598
01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:48.940
<v Speaker 2>but there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1599
01:24:48.941 --> 01:24:53.941
<v Speaker 2>with rockets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just no other way to get to </v>

1600
01:24:53.941 --> 01:24:54.610
<v Speaker 2>orbit unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the only way.</v>

1601
01:24:55.300 --> 01:25:00.300
<v Speaker 2>But with cars there's definitely a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better way with electric cars and to </v>

1602
01:25:00.670 --> 01:25:05.670
<v Speaker 2>generate the energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do so with multiple tax because we've </v>

1603
01:25:05.670 --> 01:25:08.881
<v Speaker 2>got a giant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when you clear reactor in the sky </v>

1604
01:25:08.881 --> 01:25:11.221
<v Speaker 2>called the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great sort of shows I've everyday </v>

1605
01:25:11.221 --> 01:25:14.650
<v Speaker 2>very reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you can generate energy from solar</v>

1606
01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:18.010
<v Speaker 2>panels stored with batteries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have energy 24 hours a day,</v>

1607
01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:22.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can,</v>

1608
01:25:23.170 --> 01:25:28.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consented to the polls ordinate near to </v>

1609
01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:28.170
<v Speaker 2>the north,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1610
01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:30.930
<v Speaker 2>with know high voltage lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1611
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:31.570
<v Speaker 2>the north,</v>
<v Speaker 2>northern,</v>

1612
01:25:31.571 --> 01:25:36.040
<v Speaker 2>northern parts of the world tend to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of hydropower as well.</v>

1613
01:25:37.230 --> 01:25:38.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

1614
01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:43.350
<v Speaker 2>that all fossil fuel power things have </v>
<v Speaker 2>an inherent subsidy which is their </v>

1615
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:46.690
<v Speaker 2>consumption of the carbon capacity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the atmosphere and oceans.</v>

1616
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:51.460
<v Speaker 2>So people tend to think of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1617
01:25:51.610 --> 01:25:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Why should electric vehicles have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidy?</v>

1618
01:25:54.101 --> 01:25:59.101
<v Speaker 2>But they're not taking into account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all fossil fuel book burning </v>

1619
01:25:59.530 --> 01:26:03.650
<v Speaker 2>vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by</v>
<v Speaker 2>cost,</v>

1620
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:09.010
<v Speaker 3>the environmental cost to earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nobody's paying for it.</v>

1621
01:26:09.630 --> 01:26:14.630
<v Speaker 3>We are going to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously in the future we will pay for </v>

1622
01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:15.740
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not paid for now.</v>

1623
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:21.850
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the bottleneck in regards to </v>

1624
01:26:21.850 --> 01:26:22.310
<v Speaker 3>electric cars and trucks and things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

1625
01:26:22.311 --> 01:26:23.660
<v Speaker 3>Is it battery capacity?</v>

1626
01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a scale up production.</v>

1627
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:32.950
<v Speaker 3>Got To make the car compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it better than gasoline or diesel </v>

1628
01:26:33.771 --> 01:26:38.771
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make it more efficient in terms of like </v>

1629
01:26:38.771 --> 01:26:38.771
<v Speaker 3>the distance it can travel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1630
01:26:38.771 --> 01:26:39.230
<v Speaker 3>You got to be able to go far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>far enough,</v>

1631
01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:41.240
<v Speaker 3>recharge fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're roadster,</v>

1632
01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:43.880
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're anticipating 600 miles.</v>

1633
01:26:43.881 --> 01:26:46.330
<v Speaker 3>Is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1634
01:26:46.830 --> 01:26:47.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1635
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:49.910
<v Speaker 3>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>600 mile right now,</v>

1636
01:26:49.911 --> 01:26:52.810
<v Speaker 3>like if you driven one 600 miles now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1637
01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:54.830
<v Speaker 3>we can totally make one right now that </v>
<v Speaker 3>will do 600 miles.</v>

1638
01:26:54.831 --> 01:26:59.360
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is too expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like the cars but it's more so.</v>

1639
01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:05.270
<v Speaker 3>Well just have a 200 kilowatt hour </v>
<v Speaker 3>battery pack and you can go 600 miles.</v>

1640
01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:11.140
<v Speaker 3>What do you have now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three hundred and 30 mile range,</v>

1641
01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:14.120
<v Speaker 3>but that's what does that in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>kilowatts?</v>

1642
01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:20.270
<v Speaker 3>Well that would be for a model s a 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>kilowatt hour pack.</v>

1643
01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:23.270
<v Speaker 3>We'll do about 330 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 3:35,</v>

1644
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:26.590
<v Speaker 3>but some people have hyper mild at to </v>
<v Speaker 3>500 miles.</v>

1645
01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:31.620
<v Speaker 3>Hyper mild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would go on 45 miles an hour or </v>

1646
01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:31.620
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1647
01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:36.131
<v Speaker 3>like 30 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like on level ground with a </v>

1648
01:27:36.131 --> 01:27:39.680
<v Speaker 3>pump the tires up really well and go on </v>
<v Speaker 3>a smooth surface and then you can go for</v>

1649
01:27:39.681 --> 01:27:44.681
<v Speaker 3>a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like definitely comfortably do 300 </v>

1650
01:27:44.681 --> 01:27:46.910
<v Speaker 3>miles easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is fine for most people.</v>

1651
01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:51.170
<v Speaker 3>Usually 200 or 250 miles is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three hundred miles is.</v>

1652
01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:56.980
<v Speaker 3>You don't even think about it really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any possibility that you could </v>

1653
01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:59.000
<v Speaker 3>use solar power solar powered one day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially in Los Angeles.</v>

1654
01:27:59.270 --> 01:28:04.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean as you said about that giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear reactor a million times bigger </v>

1655
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:04.270
<v Speaker 3>than earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just floating in the sky.</v>

1656
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that one day you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to just power all these cars?</v>

1657
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.960
<v Speaker 3>Just on solar power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we don't ever have cloudy days if</v>

1658
01:28:11.961 --> 01:28:13.360
<v Speaker 3>we do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three of them.</v>

1659
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:17.420
<v Speaker 3>Well the surface area of a car is</v>

1660
01:28:19.290 --> 01:28:22.920
<v Speaker 3>without making the car like really </v>
<v Speaker 3>blocky or having some.</v>

1661
01:28:22.921 --> 01:28:24.570
<v Speaker 3>Like a g wagon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1662
01:28:24.571 --> 01:28:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1663
01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:28.020
<v Speaker 3>and just like having to look a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>surface area where like maybe like solar</v>

1664
01:28:28.021 --> 01:28:30.460
<v Speaker 3>panels fold out or something like your </v>
<v Speaker 3>class.</v>

1665
01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:33.660
<v Speaker 3>That's what we needed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The type.</v>

1666
01:28:33.810 --> 01:28:38.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the e a Jaguar e type with a giant </v>

1667
01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:39.840
<v Speaker 3>long hood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could be a giant solar panel.</v>

1668
01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:45.380
<v Speaker 3>What the beginning of the Tesla did want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have this like unfolding solar panel </v>

1669
01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:49.131
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd press a button and it will just </v>

1670
01:28:49.131 --> 01:28:49.131
<v Speaker 3>unfold these solar panels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1671
01:28:49.131 --> 01:28:50.280
<v Speaker 3>charge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>recharge your car in the parking lot.</v>

1672
01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:52.860
<v Speaker 3>Ah Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could do that,</v>

1673
01:28:52.861 --> 01:28:55.800
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's probably better to just</v>
<v Speaker 3>put that on your roof.</v>

1674
01:28:56.100 --> 01:29:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's gonna be facing the sun </v>

1675
01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:01.560
<v Speaker 3>all the time because otherwise you're to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be in shade,</v>

1676
01:29:01.561 --> 01:29:02.400
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be in the shade,</v>

1677
01:29:02.401 --> 01:29:03.730
<v Speaker 3>a community garage or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1678
01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't the fisker have that on the roof?</v>

1679
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:09.300
<v Speaker 3>The fisker Karma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Generation for,</v>

1680
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:13.680
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was only for the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that correct?</v>

1681
01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:18.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think it could like reach out </v>

1682
01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:21.511
<v Speaker 3>like two miles a day or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you laugh when they started blowing </v>

1683
01:29:21.511 --> 01:29:21.511
<v Speaker 3>up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they get hit with water?</v>

1684
01:29:21.511 --> 01:29:23.880
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got the what the,</v>

1685
01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:28.920
<v Speaker 3>when they had a dealership,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fisker Karma is we're parked.</v>

1686
01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:30.900
<v Speaker 3>Is that like that with a flood in </v>
<v Speaker 3>jersey?</v>

1687
01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:35.580
<v Speaker 3>When the hurricane came in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got overwhelmed with water and they</v>

1688
01:29:35.581 --> 01:29:38.190
<v Speaker 3>all started exploding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is fucking great video of it.</v>

1689
01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Did you watch the video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch the video,</v>

1690
01:29:40.711 --> 01:29:44.460
<v Speaker 3>but I did see a picture of the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>lubed up.</v>

1691
01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Watch that video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Laugh my ass off.</v>

1692
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:50.670
<v Speaker 3>They all blow up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got wet and they blew up.</v>

1693
01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:52.260
<v Speaker 3>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1694
01:29:52.261 --> 01:29:53.010
<v Speaker 3>We made out battery.</v>

1695
01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:54.240
<v Speaker 3>Waterproof,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that doesn't happen.</v>

1696
01:29:54.241 --> 01:29:56.610
<v Speaker 3>Smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1697
01:29:56.611 --> 01:30:01.170
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy in Kazakhstan that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it was Kazakhstan,</v>

1698
01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:05.040
<v Speaker 3>that he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just bolted through a tunnel under an</v>

1699
01:30:05.041 --> 01:30:10.041
<v Speaker 3>underwater tunnel that could flooded </v>
<v Speaker 3>tunnel and just turn the wheels to steer</v>

1700
01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:15.740
<v Speaker 3>and pressed the accelerator and it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>floated through the tunnel and he </v>

1701
01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:16.770
<v Speaker 3>smiled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steered around the other cars and you're</v>

1702
01:30:16.771 --> 01:30:17.870
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

1703
01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:22.930
<v Speaker 3>On the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens if your car gets a little </v>

1704
01:30:22.930 --> 01:30:24.030
<v Speaker 3>sideways?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're driving in snow,</v>

1705
01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:29.210
<v Speaker 3>like what if you're driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're autopilot is on and you're in </v>

1706
01:30:29.210 --> 01:30:32.310
<v Speaker 3>Denver and it snows out and your car </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets a little sideways,</v>

1707
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:36.540
<v Speaker 3>does it correct itself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got great traction control,</v>

1708
01:30:36.690 --> 01:30:38.310
<v Speaker 3>but doesn't know how to like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

1709
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:39.340
<v Speaker 3>Do you know how like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1710
01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.520
<v Speaker 3>your ass and kicked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how to counter steer.</v>

1711
01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1712
01:30:42.781 --> 01:30:43.290
<v Speaker 3>that's really good.</v>

1713
01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:44.330
<v Speaker 3>He knows how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1714
01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:47.490
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty crazy.</v>

1715
01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:50.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like if you're going sideways,</v>

1716
01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.990
<v Speaker 3>he knows how to correct itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It generally won't go sideways.</v>

1717
01:30:55.020 --> 01:31:00.020
<v Speaker 3>It won't know why not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will correct itself before it goes </v>

1718
01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:00.020
<v Speaker 3>sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even in black guys.</v>

1719
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:06.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see this video is we see the car be </v>

1720
01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:11.130
<v Speaker 3>track alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Traction control system is very good.</v>

1721
01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.340
<v Speaker 3>It makes you feel like superman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

1722
01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:19.470
<v Speaker 3>You feel like you can make you feel like</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's incredible driver.</v>

1723
01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:20.610
<v Speaker 3>I believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1724
01:31:20.730 --> 01:31:24.990
<v Speaker 3>Now how do you program what we do our </v>
<v Speaker 3>testing on like an lake in Sweden.</v>

1725
01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:25.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1726
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:28.770
<v Speaker 3>Norway and Canada and a few other </v>
<v Speaker 3>places.</v>

1727
01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Porsche does a lot of that too as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do a lot of their.</v>

1728
01:31:32.130 --> 01:31:36.630
<v Speaker 3>They do some of their driver training </v>
<v Speaker 3>school on these frozen surfaces,</v>

1729
01:31:36.990 --> 01:31:38.580
<v Speaker 3>so you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1730
01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.740
<v Speaker 3>The car is going sideways with you like </v>
<v Speaker 3>it or not,</v>

1731
01:31:40.741 --> 01:31:45.741
<v Speaker 3>and you have to learn how to slide into </v>
<v Speaker 3>corners and how do we test it?</v>

1732
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:50.910
<v Speaker 3>Will electric cars have really great </v>
<v Speaker 3>traction control because the reaction </v>

1733
01:31:50.910 --> 01:31:52.320
<v Speaker 3>time is so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So with a gasoline car,</v>

1734
01:31:52.321 --> 01:31:57.321
<v Speaker 3>you've got a lot of latency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes awhile for the and the engine </v>

1735
01:31:57.321 --> 01:31:59.500
<v Speaker 3>to react and for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for</v>

1736
01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:03.070
<v Speaker 2>electric motors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly precise.</v>

1737
01:32:04.330 --> 01:32:05.620
<v Speaker 2>That's why like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1738
01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:09.280
<v Speaker 2>like if you had like a printer or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1739
01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:11.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would only,</v>

1740
01:32:11.261 --> 01:32:13.030
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't have a gasoline engine </v>
<v Speaker 2>printer.</v>

1741
01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.110
<v Speaker 2>That would be pretty weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1742
01:32:15.150 --> 01:32:16.900
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or like a surgical device.</v>

1743
01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:21.220
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be an electric motor on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the surgical device,</v>

1744
01:32:21.221 --> 01:32:26.221
<v Speaker 2>on the printer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gasoline engines going to be just </v>

1745
01:32:26.221 --> 01:32:30.421
<v Speaker 2>chugging away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to have the reaction </v>

1746
01:32:30.421 --> 01:32:30.421
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to an electric motor,</v>

1747
01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:35.320
<v Speaker 2>it's operating at the second level so it</v>
<v Speaker 2>can turn on track,</v>

1748
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:40.300
<v Speaker 2>on and off traction within inches of </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting on the honors.</v>

1749
01:32:40.301 --> 01:32:44.500
<v Speaker 2>Like let's say drive a patch of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll turn traction off and then turn it</v>

1750
01:32:44.501 --> 01:32:46.390
<v Speaker 2>on a couple of inches right after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ice,</v>

1751
01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:52.400
<v Speaker 2>like a little patch of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in the frame of the electric </v>

1752
01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:55.990
<v Speaker 2>motor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're moving incredibly slowly.</v>

1753
01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:58.000
<v Speaker 2>You're like a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's your snail.</v>

1754
01:32:58.690 --> 01:33:02.320
<v Speaker 2>You're just moving so slowly because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1755
01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:05.110
<v Speaker 2>it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can see at a thousand frames a second</v>

1756
01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:08.440
<v Speaker 2>and say one Mississippi.</v>

1757
01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:11.920
<v Speaker 2>It just thought about if things a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand times.</v>

1758
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:15.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's realized that your wheels are </v>
<v Speaker 2>not getting traction.</v>

1759
01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:18.250
<v Speaker 2>It understand that there's some slippery</v>
<v Speaker 2>surface that you driving on.</v>

1760
01:33:18.330 --> 01:33:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it makes adjustments in real time.</v>

1761
01:33:21.130 --> 01:33:23.260
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And milliseconds.</v>

1762
01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:28.860
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be so much safer than a regular </v>

1763
01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:28.860
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1764
01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:29.660
<v Speaker 2>It is just that alone for loved ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1765
01:33:29.661 --> 01:33:34.661
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd want them to be driving in your </v>

1766
01:33:34.661 --> 01:33:34.661
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1767
01:33:34.661 --> 01:33:37.981
<v Speaker 2>The onboard fuck regular motors that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>s x and three art have the lowest </v>

1768
01:33:42.131 --> 01:33:45.760
<v Speaker 2>probability of injury of any cars ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>tested by the US government.</v>

1769
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

1770
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:51.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty fun.</v>

1771
01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:52.360
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like wheat,</v>

1772
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:54.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people still sue us,</v>

1773
01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:59.340
<v Speaker 2>like they'll have like some accident at </v>
<v Speaker 2>60 miles an hour where they'd like </v>

1774
01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:03.570
<v Speaker 2>twisted an ankle and they slip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like there'll be dead in another </v>

1775
01:34:03.570 --> 01:34:04.570
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still sue us.</v>

1776
01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:05.650
<v Speaker 2>But that's to be expected.</v>

1777
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:10.800
<v Speaker 2>It is to be expected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you take that into account with like </v>

1778
01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:14.530
<v Speaker 2>the same sort of fatalistic and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1779
01:34:14.531 --> 01:34:16.150
<v Speaker 2>undertones to sort of just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1780
01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:20.260
<v Speaker 2>you gotta just let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what people do tell you.</v>

1781
01:34:20.261 --> 01:34:22.630
<v Speaker 2>I've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is quite a lot of respect for the</v>

1782
01:34:22.631 --> 01:34:25.750
<v Speaker 2>justice system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Judges are very smart and they see,</v>

1783
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:29.500
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've so far I've found judges to be</v>

1784
01:34:29.501 --> 01:34:33.000
<v Speaker 2>very good at justice because I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>

1785
01:34:33.250 --> 01:34:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and juries are good too.</v>

1786
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Like they're actually quite good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1787
01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:41.570
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1788
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:44.650
<v Speaker 2>you read about like occasional errors </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the justice system,</v>

1789
01:34:44.651 --> 01:34:46.750
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time the very good,</v>

1790
01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:52.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other guy mentioned that who </v>

1791
01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:55.620
<v Speaker 2>fell asleep in the car and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote over a cyclist and you know,</v>

1792
01:34:56.051 --> 01:34:56.740
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1793
01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:57.620
<v Speaker 2>and that was what</v>

1794
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:01.070
<v Speaker 3>encouraged me to get autopilot out as </v>
<v Speaker 3>soon as possible.</v>

1795
01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:04.550
<v Speaker 3>That guy sued us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sued you for Falling Asleep?</v>

1796
01:35:05.150 --> 01:35:05.590
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1797
01:35:05.690 --> 01:35:06.330
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1798
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:08.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna he blamed it on the new </v>
<v Speaker 3>car smell.</v>

1799
01:35:09.550 --> 01:35:09.780
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1800
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:11.580
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1801
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:16.020
<v Speaker 3>He blamed him falling asleep on your new</v>
<v Speaker 3>car smell.</v>

1802
01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:21.440
<v Speaker 3>There's someone who's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a real thing that happened was </v>

1803
01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:21.840
<v Speaker 3>there's a lawyer that thought that </v>
<v Speaker 3>through in front of his laptop before he</v>

1804
01:35:21.841 --> 01:35:24.090
<v Speaker 3>wrote that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1805
01:35:24.150 --> 01:35:26.850
<v Speaker 3>He got a lawyer and he sued us and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>judge was like,</v>

1806
01:35:27.190 --> 01:35:30.090
<v Speaker 3>you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop bothering me.</v>

1807
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:32.010
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank God.</v>

1808
01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:33.390
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank God.</v>

1809
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:38.510
<v Speaker 3>Thank God there's a judge out there with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a brain until you dredges are judges a </v>

1810
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.700
<v Speaker 3>very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them.</v>

1811
01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:43.760
<v Speaker 3>What about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a lot of boys up up the river in </v>

1812
01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:44.460
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania who was selling those kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1813
01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:49.620
<v Speaker 3>You know about that story?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Judge was selling young boys to </v>

1814
01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:51.060
<v Speaker 3>presence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like literally.</v>

1815
01:35:51.061 --> 01:35:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally under bribes for he was.</v>

1816
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:59.590
<v Speaker 3>Was this an elected judge or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have a judge that's like actually a </v>

1817
01:35:59.590 --> 01:36:04.581
<v Speaker 3>politician elected judge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a very famous story who he's in </v>

1818
01:36:04.581 --> 01:36:06.150
<v Speaker 3>jail right now I think for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 3>his life,</v>

1819
01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:11.480
<v Speaker 3>and he put away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would take like a young boy would do </v>

1820
01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:14.190
<v Speaker 3>something like steal something from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>store and he would put them in detention</v>

1821
01:36:14.191 --> 01:36:16.860
<v Speaker 3>for five years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something ridiculous,</v>

1822
01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:21.900
<v Speaker 3>egregious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they investigated this history and </v>

1823
01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:23.400
<v Speaker 3>they found out that he was literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>being paid off.</v>

1824
01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:27.210
<v Speaker 3>Was it by private prisons?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what the deal was?</v>

1825
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:29.760
<v Speaker 3>There was some sort of a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

1826
01:36:29.761 --> 01:36:34.761
<v Speaker 3>this judges two judges who judges kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>for cash scandal is what called the </v>

1827
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:37.260
<v Speaker 3>common pleas judges.</v>

1828
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:40.760
<v Speaker 3>So I think they are elected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And who was paying them?</v>

1829
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:41.750
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1830
01:36:43.650 --> 01:36:46.760
<v Speaker 3>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was proven to the point where they're</v>

1831
01:36:46.770 --> 01:36:51.770
<v Speaker 3>in jail now that someone was paying them</v>
<v Speaker 3>to put more asses in the seats in these </v>

1832
01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:58.100
<v Speaker 3>private prisons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollar payment to put them in </v>

1833
01:36:58.100 --> 01:36:58.860
<v Speaker 3>the youth centers builder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A million dollar payment.</v>

1834
01:36:58.861 --> 01:37:03.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think it's this private prisons </v>

1835
01:37:03.861 --> 01:37:03.861
<v Speaker 3>thing is creating a bad incentive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dark,</v>

1836
01:37:03.861 --> 01:37:04.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1837
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:09.870
<v Speaker 3>But that judge is in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank God.</v>

1838
01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:14.900
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for people who think perhaps the </v>

1839
01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:15.900
<v Speaker 3>justice system consists entirely of </v>
<v Speaker 3>judges like that.</v>

1840
01:37:15.901 --> 01:37:18.120
<v Speaker 3>I want to assure you this is not the </v>
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>

1841
01:37:18.570 --> 01:37:20.700
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority of judges have very </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1842
01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:25.760
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they care about justice and they </v>

1843
01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:27.921
<v Speaker 3>could have made a lot more money if they</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to be a trial lawyer and instead </v>

1844
01:37:27.921 --> 01:37:31.701
<v Speaker 3>they cared about justice and they made </v>
<v Speaker 3>less money because they care about </v>

1845
01:37:31.701 --> 01:37:31.701
<v Speaker 3>justice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why they're judges.</v>

1846
01:37:31.701 --> 01:37:33.210
<v Speaker 3>I feel that same way about police </v>
<v Speaker 3>officers.</v>

1847
01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:38.480
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's so many interactions</v>
<v Speaker 3>with so many different people with </v>

1848
01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:41.010
<v Speaker 3>police officers that the very few that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand out that are horrific,</v>

1849
01:37:41.250 --> 01:37:45.430
<v Speaker 3>we tend to look at that like this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence that police are all corrupt and</v>

1850
01:37:45.431 --> 01:37:46.530
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's crazy.</v>

1851
01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:47.760
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>

1852
01:37:47.761 --> 01:37:48.650
<v Speaker 3>most police are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

1853
01:37:48.710 --> 01:37:49.890
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are very honest.</v>

1854
01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1855
01:37:52.330 --> 01:37:52.700
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1856
01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:57.720
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like the military or military </v>

1857
01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:57.720
<v Speaker 3>personnel</v>

1858
01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:00.980
<v Speaker 2>that I know of very honorable ethical </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and much more honorable ethical </v>

1859
01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:01.950
<v Speaker 2>than the average person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my impression.</v>

1860
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:07.070
<v Speaker 2>That's my impression as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not to suggest that we be </v>

1861
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:08.130
<v Speaker 2>complacent and assume everyone's honest </v>
<v Speaker 2>and ethical.</v>

1862
01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:11.150
<v Speaker 2>And obviously if somebody is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is given ape,</v>

1863
01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:16.350
<v Speaker 2>a trusted place in society such as being</v>
<v Speaker 2>a police officer or a judge and they all</v>

1864
01:38:16.351 --> 01:38:21.351
<v Speaker 2>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we must be extra vigilant against </v>

1865
01:38:21.351 --> 01:38:21.680
<v Speaker 2>such situations and take action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1866
01:38:21.690 --> 01:38:26.690
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we should not think that this is </v>

1867
01:38:26.690 --> 01:38:26.690
<v Speaker 2>somehow broadly descriptive of people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that profession.</v>

1868
01:38:26.910 --> 01:38:29.700
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't agree more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's also an issue with,</v>

1869
01:38:29.701 --> 01:38:34.701
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that happens with </v>

1870
01:38:34.701 --> 01:38:34.701
<v Speaker 2>police officers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prosecutors,</v>

1871
01:38:34.701 --> 01:38:39.081
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and anyone that's trying to convict </v>

1872
01:38:39.081 --> 01:38:41.271
<v Speaker 2>someone or arrest someone is that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes a game and in games people want </v>

1873
01:38:41.271 --> 01:38:42.270
<v Speaker 2>to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people cheat.</v>

1874
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1875
01:38:45.061 --> 01:38:46.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1876
01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your prosecutor shoot,</v>

1877
01:38:48.151 --> 01:38:51.180
<v Speaker 2>you should not always went to when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are times when you should,</v>

1878
01:38:51.181 --> 01:38:51.710
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1879
01:38:52.050 --> 01:38:53.550
<v Speaker 2>I just did not want to win this case.</v>

1880
01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then just pass on that case.</v>

1881
01:38:57.420 --> 01:38:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people want to win too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>

1882
01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think also the,</v>

1883
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:05.460
<v Speaker 2>they call it becomes tough if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're like a district Tony,</v>

1884
01:39:06.970 --> 01:39:11.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tend to sort of see a lot of </v>

1885
01:39:11.970 --> 01:39:14.160
<v Speaker 2>criminals and then your view of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world can get negatively,</v>

1886
01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:15.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a negative,</v>

1887
01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:21.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a negative view of the world </v>

1888
01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:21.740
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1889
01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:22.800
<v Speaker 2>you're just interacting with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>criminals.</v>

1890
01:39:23.070 --> 01:39:25.800
<v Speaker 2>But actually most of society is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>consistent criminals.</v>

1891
01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we had this conversation with Dennis</v>

1892
01:39:28.451 --> 01:39:31.050
<v Speaker 2>several years ago with Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1893
01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:32.730
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must sometimes seem pretty,</v>

1894
01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.640
<v Speaker 2>pretty dark because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1895
01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:36.870
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>

1896
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:40.530
<v Speaker 2>some terrible human beings out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

1897
01:39:40.531 --> 01:39:45.531
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like dealing with some case </v>

1898
01:39:45.531 --> 01:39:48.770
<v Speaker 2>which consisted of a couple of old </v>
<v Speaker 2>ladies that would run people over </v>

1899
01:39:49.561 --> 01:39:50.940
<v Speaker 2>somehow for insurance money.</v>

1900
01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.640
<v Speaker 2>It was rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1901
01:39:53.641 --> 01:39:57.430
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty rough as like,</v>

1902
01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:00.750
<v Speaker 2>it's like hard to maintain faith in </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity if you're a district attorney,</v>

1903
01:40:00.751 --> 01:40:02.370
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1904
01:40:02.371 --> 01:40:07.050
<v Speaker 2>it's only a few percent of society that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are actually bad.</v>

1905
01:40:07.051 --> 01:40:12.051
<v Speaker 2>And then if you go to the worst say </v>
<v Speaker 2>point one percent of society or the </v>

1906
01:40:12.130 --> 01:40:14.520
<v Speaker 2>worst one in a thousand one in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>million,</v>

1907
01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:20.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how bad is the millionth worst </v>

1908
01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:20.250
<v Speaker 2>person in the United States?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty damn bad.</v>

1909
01:40:20.910 --> 01:40:23.220
<v Speaker 2>Like damn evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>

1910
01:40:24.090 --> 01:40:29.090
<v Speaker 2>the million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the millionth of one in a million </v>

1911
01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:30.840
<v Speaker 2>of evil is so evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He will,</v>

1912
01:40:30.841 --> 01:40:35.841
<v Speaker 2>could not even conceive of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's 330 million people in the </v>

1913
01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:41.240
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's 330 people out there </v>

1914
01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:41.790
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by the same token,</v>

1915
01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:46.820
<v Speaker 2>there's also 330 people are incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>angels and unbelievably good human </v>

1916
01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:48.900
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1917
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:52.590
<v Speaker 2>on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because of our fear of danger,</v>

1918
01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:53.830
<v Speaker 2>we tend to.</v>

1919
01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Our thoughts tend to gravitate towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst case scenario and we want to </v>

1920
01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.760
<v Speaker 1>frame that and that is one of the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with prejudice.</v>

1921
01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:06.260
<v Speaker 1>We want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's prejudice towards a </v>

1922
01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:07.960
<v Speaker 1>different minorities or prejudice </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards police officers or anything.</v>

1923
01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:13.320
<v Speaker 1>So we want to look at the worst case </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario and say this is an example of </v>

1924
01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:15.310
<v Speaker 1>what this is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see that even with people,</v>

1925
01:41:15.311 --> 01:41:18.940
<v Speaker 1>how they frame genders and some some men</v>
<v Speaker 1>from women like that,</v>

1926
01:41:18.941 --> 01:41:22.060
<v Speaker 1>they get ripped off by a few women and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they said all women are evil.</v>

1927
01:41:22.150 --> 01:41:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Some women get fucked over by a few men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All men are shit.</v>

1928
01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:28.660
<v Speaker 1>And in this this is very toxic and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

1929
01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:34.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a very unbalanced way of viewing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and it's very emotionally </v>

1930
01:41:34.331 --> 01:41:36.580
<v Speaker 1>based and it's based on your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

1931
01:41:36.581 --> 01:41:39.820
<v Speaker 1>your own anecdotal experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can.</v>

1932
01:41:39.821 --> 01:41:42.370
<v Speaker 1>It can be very influential to the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>

1933
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:45.010
<v Speaker 1>And it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a dangerous way.</v>

1934
01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a dangerous thought process and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern to promote.</v>

1935
01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:50.120
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a very dangerous pattern.</v>

1936
01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:55.300
<v Speaker 3>I really think people should give other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people the benefit of the doubt and </v>

1937
01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.580
<v Speaker 3>assume that they're good until proven </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise,</v>

1938
01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:02.420
<v Speaker 3>and I think really most people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually pretty good people.</v>

1939
01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:05.300
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be.</v>

1940
01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:10.450
<v Speaker 3>If you think of vast numbers of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just interacting with each </v>

1941
01:42:10.450 --> 01:42:10.450
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with each other constantly.</v>

1942
01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:12.620
<v Speaker 3>We have to be better than we think we </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

1943
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:15.650
<v Speaker 3>There's no other way right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these weapons.</v>

1944
01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:18.080
<v Speaker 3>But how many times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like nobody's presumably tried to murder</v>

1945
01:42:18.081 --> 01:42:19.200
<v Speaker 3>you in your industry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1946
01:42:19.210 --> 01:42:23.690
<v Speaker 3>Nobody is like fake flame thrower here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a flame thrower.</v>

1947
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:26.000
<v Speaker 3>Now we've got a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put it on that side too.</v>

1948
01:42:26.001 --> 01:42:28.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to leave it for the guests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1949
01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:29.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look man,</v>

1950
01:42:29.391 --> 01:42:31.550
<v Speaker 3>if I say something that fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's right there.</v>

1951
01:42:31.850 --> 01:42:36.650
<v Speaker 3>So to liven things up for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guaranteed to make any party better.</v>

1952
01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:38.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's.</v>

1953
01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the armed a civilization </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

1954
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:46.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That an armed community is a safe and </v>

1955
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:47.300
<v Speaker 1>polite community</v>

1956
01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:50.780
<v Speaker 3>in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of true.</v>

1957
01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:52.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1958
01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:58.240
<v Speaker 3>people in Texas are super polite and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody don't make somebody angry.</v>

1959
01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:02.080
<v Speaker 3>Don't know what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1960
01:43:02.081 --> 01:43:03.380
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good mood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1961
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:05.360
<v Speaker 3>Piss people off when everybody can have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a gun.</v>

1962
01:43:06.330 --> 01:43:08.990
<v Speaker 3>Just let that guy get in your lane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1963
01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:11.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got a big,</v>

1964
01:43:11.630 --> 01:43:16.630
<v Speaker 3>a test site in central Texas near Waco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful space x,</v>

1965
01:43:16.851 --> 01:43:21.851
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Mcgregor just about 15 minutes away </v>

1966
01:43:21.851 --> 01:43:22.040
<v Speaker 3>from Waco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's close to where Ted nugent lives.</v>

1967
01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:24.410
<v Speaker 3>It has to Ted nugent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1968
01:43:24.411 --> 01:43:26.120
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1969
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:28.280
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1970
01:43:28.281 --> 01:43:33.281
<v Speaker 3>we have lots of fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loud explosions and things and people </v>

1971
01:43:33.281 --> 01:43:33.281
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're cool with it.</v>

1972
01:43:33.281 --> 01:43:34.790
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a fuck out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very supportive.</v>

1973
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:38.090
<v Speaker 3>You can buy fireworks where your kids go</v>
<v Speaker 3>to school.</v>

1974
01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:39.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1975
01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:41.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's dangerous.</v>

1976
01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:43.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's free.</v>

1977
01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:48.310
<v Speaker 3>It's free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is something that's very enticing </v>

1978
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.380
<v Speaker 3>because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is dangerous,</v>

1979
01:43:48.710 --> 01:43:50.120
<v Speaker 3>but it's also free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1980
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1981
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:53.750
<v Speaker 1>I kinda like Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1982
01:43:53.751 --> 01:43:58.751
<v Speaker 1>I prefer it over places that are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictive but more liberal because you</v>

1983
01:43:59.871 --> 01:44:03.920
<v Speaker 1>could always be liberal like just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because things are free and just because</v>

1984
01:44:03.921 --> 01:44:05.330
<v Speaker 1>you have a certain amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1985
01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:08.750
<v Speaker 1>right wing type characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean you have to be that way,</v>

1986
01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:14.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and honestly there's a lot of those </v>

1987
01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:16.121
<v Speaker 1>people that are pretty fucking open </v>
<v Speaker 1>minded and let you do whatever you want </v>

1988
01:44:16.121 --> 01:44:17.780
<v Speaker 1>to do and you don't bother them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1989
01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:23.080
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my hope right now with the way </v>

1990
01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:27.311
<v Speaker 1>we're able to communicate with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other today and how radically different </v>

1991
01:44:27.311 --> 01:44:28.460
<v Speaker 1>it is than generations past is that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>all just.</v>

1992
01:44:28.610 --> 01:44:30.870
<v Speaker 1>The dust settles and we all realized </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1993
01:44:31.150 --> 01:44:34.220
<v Speaker 1>like what you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that most people are good.</v>

1994
01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Most people are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority.</v>

1995
01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should give people the </v>

1996
01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:41.440
<v Speaker 1>benefit of the doubt for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

1997
01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what can help that?</v>

1998
01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:45.130
<v Speaker 1>What mushrooms do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>

1999
01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:47.600
<v Speaker 1>They're delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2000
01:44:47.601 --> 01:44:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

2001
01:44:49.450 --> 01:44:53.090
<v Speaker 1>To all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of.</v>

2002
01:44:55.820 --> 01:45:00.820
<v Speaker 1>What do you see in terms of when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about the future of your </v>

2003
01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:02.540
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you see as like bottlenecks?</v>

2004
01:45:02.590 --> 01:45:04.130
<v Speaker 1>He wants more of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2005
01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you see in terms of like </v>

2006
01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:11.450
<v Speaker 1>bottlenecks of things that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are holding back innovation?</v>

2007
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Is it regulatory commissions and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't understand the technology </v>

2008
01:45:16.821 --> 01:45:20.370
<v Speaker 1>that are influencing policy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

2009
01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:25.380
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What could potentially be holding you </v>

2010
01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:25.380
<v Speaker 1>guys back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2011
01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:25.380
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2012
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that you would change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2013
01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:30.740
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

2014
01:45:34.990 --> 01:45:35.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish.</v>

2015
01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:38.590
<v Speaker 1>I wish politicians were better at </v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

2016
01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:41.140
<v Speaker 1>That would help a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>

2017
01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no incentive for them to be good</v>

2018
01:45:44.681 --> 01:45:46.270
<v Speaker 1>at science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't.</v>

2019
01:45:47.290 --> 01:45:48.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2020
01:45:48.331 --> 01:45:49.990
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty good at science in China,</v>

2021
01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:52.810
<v Speaker 1>I have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2022
01:45:52.811 --> 01:45:57.811
<v Speaker 1>The mayor of Beijing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in environmental engineering </v>

2023
01:45:57.811 --> 01:45:58.510
<v Speaker 1>degree and the deputy mayor as a physics</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

2024
01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I met them and the mayor say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shanghai has really smart and you're up </v>

2025
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:09.470
<v Speaker 1>on technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about this government </v>

2026
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:11.760
<v Speaker 1>policy of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of stopping use of walway phones and </v>

2027
01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:12.750
<v Speaker 1>there's something about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2028
01:46:12.751 --> 01:46:16.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worry about spying is,</v>

2029
01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what I've understand from real tech</v>

2030
01:46:19.181 --> 01:46:20.770
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think it's horseshit.</v>

2031
01:46:23.250 --> 01:46:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2032
01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:28.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like the government said don't you,</v>

2033
01:46:28.051 --> 01:46:31.450
<v Speaker 1>by Huawei phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that do,</v>

2034
01:46:31.930 --> 01:46:34.620
<v Speaker 1>are you up on that are all now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we just spend in this idea?</v>

2035
01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:37.650
<v Speaker 1>And I think like I guess if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

2036
01:46:37.651 --> 01:46:40.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have like top secret stuff,</v>

2037
01:46:40.650 --> 01:46:43.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you want to be pretty careful about</v>

2038
01:46:43.201 --> 01:46:45.260
<v Speaker 1>what hardware you use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2039
01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:50.300
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most people do not have top secret </v>

2040
01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:50.610
<v Speaker 1>stuff and like nobody cares what porn </v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch,</v>

2041
01:46:50.970 --> 01:46:55.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like nobody actually cares,</v>

2042
01:46:55.650 --> 01:46:57.300
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they do,</v>

2043
01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:02.280
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like national spy agencies do not,</v>

2044
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:07.260
<v Speaker 1>do not give a rat's ass watch porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Watch,</v>

2045
01:47:07.261 --> 01:47:12.261
<v Speaker 1>they do not to care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like what secrets does a national spy</v>

2046
01:47:12.901 --> 01:47:14.820
<v Speaker 1>agency have to learn from the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizen?</v>

2047
01:47:14.821 --> 01:47:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Probably nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2048
01:47:15.991 --> 01:47:18.980
<v Speaker 1>that's the argument against the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2049
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:24.070
<v Speaker 1>the narrative in the argument by a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these tech people is that the real </v>

2050
01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:28.041
<v Speaker 1>concern is that these companies like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Huawei are innovating at a radical pace </v>

2051
01:47:28.041 --> 01:47:30.990
<v Speaker 1>and they're trying to stop them from </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrating into our culture and letting</v>

2052
01:47:30.991 --> 01:47:31.260
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2053
01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>

2054
01:47:32.401 --> 01:47:35.310
<v Speaker 1>they're the number two cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturer in the world.</v>

2055
01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Samsung's number one hallway is number </v>

2056
01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:40.360
<v Speaker 1>two apples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2057
01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:41.070
<v Speaker 1>number three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they surpassed apple is number two.</v>

2058
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:46.430
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that this is all taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>place without them having any foothold </v>

2059
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:47.520
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In America there are no,</v>

2060
01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:50.430
<v Speaker 1>there's no carriers that have their </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones.</v>

2061
01:47:50.670 --> 01:47:55.670
<v Speaker 1>You have to buy their phones unlocked </v>
<v Speaker 1>through some sort of a third party and </v>

2062
01:47:55.670 --> 01:47:55.700
<v Speaker 1>then put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2063
01:47:56.100 --> 01:48:01.100
<v Speaker 1>So the worry is that these are somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>or another controlled by the Chinese </v>

2064
01:48:02.041 --> 01:48:07.041
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The communist Chinese government is </v>

2065
01:48:07.041 --> 01:48:08.280
<v Speaker 1>going to distribute these phones and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know if it's the worries,</v>

2066
01:48:08.670 --> 01:48:11.760
<v Speaker 1>economic influence that they'll have too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much power.</v>

2067
01:48:11.761 --> 01:48:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>

2068
01:48:13.410 --> 01:48:15.870
<v Speaker 1>are you paying attention on any of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really,</v>

2069
01:48:15.871 --> 01:48:20.871
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we worry too much about </v>

2070
01:48:20.871 --> 01:48:20.871
<v Speaker 1>Huawei phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2071
01:48:20.871 --> 01:48:21.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you know,</v>

2072
01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.370
<v Speaker 1>our national security agencies shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have how?</v>

2073
01:48:23.370 --> 01:48:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's a question mark,</v>

2074
01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:32.120
<v Speaker 1>but I think for the average citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter just like.</v>

2075
01:48:32.581 --> 01:48:37.581
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure the Chinese government </v>

2076
01:48:37.581 --> 01:48:40.251
<v Speaker 1>does not care about the goings on of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>average American citizen is.</v>

2077
01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Is there a time where you think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there will be no security will be </v>

2078
01:48:48.391 --> 01:48:51.830
<v Speaker 1>impossible to hold back information that</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever bottleneck will,</v>

2079
01:48:51.831 --> 01:48:53.460
<v Speaker 1>will let go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna,</v>

2080
01:48:53.850 --> 01:48:58.850
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna give in that whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottleneck between privacy and ultimate </v>

2081
01:48:58.850 --> 01:49:03.471
<v Speaker 1>innovation will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will have to be bridged in order for us </v>

2082
01:49:03.471 --> 01:49:05.010
<v Speaker 1>to achieve the next level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological proficiency.</v>

2083
01:49:05.011 --> 01:49:07.230
<v Speaker 1>That we're just going to abandon it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be no,</v>

2084
01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:09.180
<v Speaker 1>no security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no privacy.</v>

2085
01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Do people want privacy because they seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put everything on the Internet?</v>

2086
01:49:13.590 --> 01:49:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now they're confused,</v>

2087
01:49:15.241 --> 01:49:17.120
<v Speaker 1>but when you're talking about your neuro</v>
<v Speaker 1>link and this,</v>

2088
01:49:17.121 --> 01:49:22.121
<v Speaker 1>this idea that one day we're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to share information and we're </v>

2089
01:49:22.121 --> 01:49:25.731
<v Speaker 1>going to be some sort of a thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbiotically create a symbiotic and </v>

2090
01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:31.040
<v Speaker 1>connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we really need to worry about </v>

2091
01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:31.040
<v Speaker 1>security and that situation and one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2092
01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:32.640
<v Speaker 1>That's like a security repair amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

2093
01:49:33.060 --> 01:49:36.810
<v Speaker 1>but also we will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will be is will be so much different.</v>

2094
01:49:36.811 --> 01:49:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Lark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our concerns about money,</v>

2095
01:49:39.570 --> 01:49:44.570
<v Speaker 1>about status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about where all these things will will </v>

2096
01:49:44.570 --> 01:49:45.360
<v Speaker 1>seemingly go by the wayside if we really</v>
<v Speaker 1>become enlightened,</v>

2097
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:50.750
<v Speaker 1>if we really become artificially </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened by some sort of an ai </v>

2098
01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:55.170
<v Speaker 1>interface where we have this symbiotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with some new Internet type</v>

2099
01:49:58.030 --> 01:49:59.710
<v Speaker 1>connection to inflammation.</v>

2100
01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:03.000
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens then?</v>

2101
01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:05.120
<v Speaker 9>What?</v>

2102
01:50:06.330 --> 01:50:08.220
<v Speaker 1>What is important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is not important?</v>

2103
01:50:08.221 --> 01:50:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Is Privacy important when we're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>gods?</v>

2104
01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:16.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think the things that we think </v>
<v Speaker 3>are important,</v>

2105
01:50:16.901 --> 01:50:19.980
<v Speaker 3>key private right now we probably will </v>
<v Speaker 3>not think are important.</v>

2106
01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:23.050
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Information,</v>

2107
01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:26.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>

2108
01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.130
<v Speaker 3>what do you hide?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Emotions.</v>

2109
01:50:28.170 --> 01:50:29.880
<v Speaker 3>What do we hide?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2110
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:31.020
<v Speaker 3>I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2111
01:50:31.021 --> 01:50:34.200
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's like embarrassing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so embarrassing stuff,</v>

2112
01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:35.610
<v Speaker 9>but</v>

2113
01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:41.440
<v Speaker 3>there's actually like I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not that much that's kept </v>

2114
01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:43.640
<v Speaker 3>private.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that is actually relevant,</v>

2115
01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:48.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's people what other people would </v>

2116
01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:48.740
<v Speaker 3>actually care about and we think other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people care about it,</v>

2117
01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:49.300
<v Speaker 3>but they don't really care about her </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

2118
01:50:49.301 --> 01:50:50.290
<v Speaker 3>Certainly governments don't.</v>

2119
01:50:50.730 --> 01:50:51.010
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

2120
01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:53.680
<v Speaker 1>well some people care about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it gets weird when you,</v>

2121
01:50:53.710 --> 01:50:56.260
<v Speaker 1>when it gets exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Jennifer Lawrence when I was naked,</v>

2122
01:50:56.261 --> 01:51:01.261
<v Speaker 1>pictures of her God exposed like I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways people liked her more than </v>

2123
01:51:01.261 --> 01:51:01.330
<v Speaker 1>they realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2124
01:51:01.331 --> 01:51:05.950
<v Speaker 1>she's just a person that just a girl who</v>
<v Speaker 1>likes sacs and it's just alive and has a</v>

2125
01:51:05.951 --> 01:51:09.850
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend and send them messages and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to look into it and you probably</v>

2126
01:51:09.851 --> 01:51:13.720
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have somebody let it go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they put it online and the all right.</v>

2127
01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:17.810
<v Speaker 3>She seems to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2128
01:51:18.090 --> 01:51:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just you and me and the same </v>

2129
01:51:23.090 --> 01:51:25.821
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just send some weird place where </v>

2130
01:51:25.821 --> 01:51:27.390
<v Speaker 1>she's on a 35 foot tall screen with </v>
<v Speaker 1>music playing every time she talks.</v>

2131
01:51:30.130 --> 01:51:30.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2132
01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:32.920
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure she's,</v>

2133
01:51:32.921 --> 01:51:33.800
<v Speaker 3>she's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2134
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:35.950
<v Speaker 3>not happy about it but she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's.</v>

2135
01:51:36.010 --> 01:51:37.960
<v Speaker 3>But she's clearly doing fine.</v>

2136
01:51:38.090 --> 01:51:43.090
<v Speaker 1>But once this interface is fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized where we really do become </v>

2137
01:51:44.241 --> 01:51:49.241
<v Speaker 1>something far more powerful in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our cognitive ability,</v>

2138
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:54.370
<v Speaker 1>our ability to understand irrational </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and mitigate them and that </v>

2139
01:51:54.370 --> 01:51:57.260
<v Speaker 1>we're all connected and some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane way.</v>

2140
01:51:57.261 --> 01:51:57.760
<v Speaker 1>What I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

2141
01:51:57.761 --> 01:51:58.050
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2142
01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:01.640
<v Speaker 1>what are thoughts on wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our thoughts on social status,</v>

2143
01:52:01.641 --> 01:52:05.480
<v Speaker 1>like how many of those just evaporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and our need for privacy.</v>

2144
01:52:06.050 --> 01:52:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe our need for privacy will be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate bottleneck that we'll have to </v>

2145
01:52:11.050 --> 01:52:11.050
<v Speaker 1>subsidize that we'll have to surpass.</v>

2146
01:52:13.930 --> 01:52:14.320
<v Speaker 9>I think</v>

2147
01:52:15.330 --> 01:52:20.330
<v Speaker 3>the things that we think are important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No will probably not to be important in </v>

2148
01:52:20.330 --> 01:52:24.321
<v Speaker 3>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there will be things that are </v>

2149
01:52:24.321 --> 01:52:25.610
<v Speaker 3>important for things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2150
01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:28.230
<v Speaker 3>They might be some war of ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially.</v>

2151
01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:31.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't think Darwin's going away.</v>

2152
01:52:32.110 --> 01:52:32.470
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

2153
01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:38.380
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was on will be there forever.</v>

2154
01:52:39.690 --> 01:52:41.010
<v Speaker 3>Forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2155
01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:43.620
<v Speaker 3>It would just be a difference in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different arena.</v>

2156
01:52:45.270 --> 01:52:46.030
<v Speaker 3>Different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The</v>

2157
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.470
<v Speaker 2>digital arena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different arena.</v>

2158
01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Dawn is not going away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What keeps you up at night?</v>

2159
01:52:57.740 --> 01:52:59.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite hard to run companies.</v>

2160
01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially car companies.</v>

2161
01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:03.590
<v Speaker 2>How did they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite challenging.</v>

2162
01:53:03.770 --> 01:53:08.770
<v Speaker 2>The car businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hardest one of all the things you </v>

2163
01:53:08.770 --> 01:53:08.770
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2164
01:53:08.770 --> 01:53:12.790
<v Speaker 2>because it's a consumer oriented </v>
<v Speaker 2>business as opposed to like space x and </v>

2165
01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:16.310
<v Speaker 2>not that space x space X.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no walk in the park but,</v>

2166
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:22.510
<v Speaker 2>but a car company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to keep a company </v>

2167
01:53:22.510 --> 01:53:22.940
<v Speaker 2>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult.</v>

2168
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:28.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only two car companies and the </v>

2169
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:29.510
<v Speaker 2>history of American car companies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't gone bankrupt.</v>

2170
01:53:29.511 --> 01:53:32.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's Ford and Tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2171
01:53:33.590 --> 01:53:35.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ford wrote out that crazy storm.</v>

2172
01:53:35.751 --> 01:53:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the only ones.</v>

2173
01:53:36.930 --> 01:53:39.080
<v Speaker 2>The skin of their teeth shout out to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mustang.</v>

2174
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the skin of their teeth.</v>

2175
01:53:42.710 --> 01:53:43.600
<v Speaker 2>That is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2176
01:53:43.610 --> 01:53:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Same with Tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We barely survived.</v>

2177
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:49.880
<v Speaker 2>How close did you get to folding?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very close.</v>

2178
01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:54.920
<v Speaker 2>We a 2008 is not a good time to be a car</v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

2179
01:53:54.921 --> 01:53:58.340
<v Speaker 2>especially a startup company and </v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in electric car company.</v>

2180
01:53:58.850 --> 01:54:03.850
<v Speaker 2>I was like stupidity squared and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you had those cool roadsters with </v>

2181
01:54:03.850 --> 01:54:05.510
<v Speaker 2>the t top with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a target top.</v>

2182
01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had like a,</v>

2183
01:54:08.710 --> 01:54:12.350
<v Speaker 2>he was a highly modified elise chassis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The body was all completely different,</v>

2184
01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:16.980
<v Speaker 2>but that was super dumb strategy that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually did was dumb.</v>

2185
01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:23.260
<v Speaker 2>It was based on false premises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One false premise was that we'd be able </v>

2186
01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:24.440
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2187
01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:29.500
<v Speaker 2>cheaply convert the Lotus Elise and use </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as a core platform and that we will</v>

2188
01:54:31.851 --> 01:54:36.851
<v Speaker 2>be able to use technology from this </v>
<v Speaker 2>little company called ace propulsion for</v>

2189
01:54:37.281 --> 01:54:42.281
<v Speaker 2>the electric drive train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the battery problem is they </v>

2190
01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:48.100
<v Speaker 2>propulsion technology to not work in </v>
<v Speaker 2>production and we ended up using none of</v>

2191
01:54:48.201 --> 01:54:48.920
<v Speaker 2>it in long term.</v>

2192
01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:50.930
<v Speaker 2>None of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to redesign everything.</v>

2193
01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:55.460
<v Speaker 2>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you add a battery pack and electric</v>

2194
01:54:55.461 --> 01:54:57.480
<v Speaker 2>motor to the cart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a heavier cut,</v>

2195
01:54:57.500 --> 01:55:00.680
<v Speaker 2>30 percent heavier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>invalidated the entire structure,</v>

2196
01:55:00.681 --> 01:55:02.890
<v Speaker 2>all the crash structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything had to be redone,</v>

2197
01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:09.460
<v Speaker 2>nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it had less than seven percent </v>

2198
01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:13.481
<v Speaker 2>of the parts were common with any other </v>
<v Speaker 2>device including cars or anything else?</v>

2199
01:55:13.631 --> 01:55:17.330
<v Speaker 2>The seven percent yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything including tires and wheels,</v>

2200
01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:22.480
<v Speaker 2>bolts breaks even every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'll see the steering wheel was.</v>

2201
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:27.260
<v Speaker 2>I think the steering wheel was almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same.</v>

2202
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The windscreen went Wednesday.</v>

2203
01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:33.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the windscreen is the same.</v>

2204
01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2205
01:55:34.190 --> 01:55:36.260
<v Speaker 2>I think we were able to keep the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven percent.</v>

2206
01:55:36.261 --> 01:55:38.840
<v Speaker 2>So that's basically every body panel was</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

2207
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:43.530
<v Speaker 2>The entire structure was different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way we couldn't use the H,</v>

2208
01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 2>like the</v>

2209
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:47.160
<v Speaker 3>HVAC system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the view of the air conditioner was belt</v>

2210
01:55:47.161 --> 01:55:48.540
<v Speaker 3>driven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>air conditioner off.</v>

2211
01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:54.230
<v Speaker 3>So now we needed a something that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>electrically driven which needed a new </v>

2212
01:55:54.230 --> 01:55:57.510
<v Speaker 3>AC compressor and all that takes away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the battery life as well.</v>

2213
01:55:57.511 --> 01:55:58.260
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2214
01:55:58.290 --> 01:56:02.130
<v Speaker 3>We needed an small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>highly efficient air conditioning system</v>

2215
01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:06.220
<v Speaker 3>that fit in a tiny car and was </v>
<v Speaker 3>electrically powered belt driven.</v>

2216
01:56:06.850 --> 01:56:10.830
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much do those weigh those cars?</v>

2217
01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:14.190
<v Speaker 3>The roadster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was about 2,700</v>

2218
01:56:14.191 --> 01:56:19.191
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's still very depending on which </v>

2219
01:56:19.191 --> 01:56:19.191
<v Speaker 3>version?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty six,</v>

2220
01:56:19.191 --> 01:56:19.191
<v Speaker 3>52,</v>
<v Speaker 3>27,</v>

2221
01:56:19.191 --> 01:56:19.191
<v Speaker 3>50 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2222
01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:21.150
<v Speaker 3>And what was the weight distribution?</v>

2223
01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:27.690
<v Speaker 3>It was about 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they were different versions of the</v>

2224
01:56:27.691 --> 01:56:32.691
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's about 55 on the rear because </v>

2225
01:56:32.691 --> 01:56:33.540
<v Speaker 3>we're bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2226
01:56:33.541 --> 01:56:36.300
<v Speaker 3>But not bad considering like a nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>slash 11,</v>

2227
01:56:36.301 --> 01:56:39.360
<v Speaker 3>which is like one of the most popular </v>
<v Speaker 3>sports cards of all time heavy.</v>

2228
01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:41.310
<v Speaker 3>We're in bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2229
01:56:41.850 --> 01:56:44.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nine slash 11.</v>

2230
01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:50.040
<v Speaker 3>Like the joke is like the bench dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite Newton not being on their side.</v>

2231
01:56:51.140 --> 01:56:52.800
<v Speaker 3>If you have fighting Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult.</v>

2232
01:56:53.250 --> 01:56:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you've got this,</v>

2233
01:56:55.150 --> 01:56:58.650
<v Speaker 3>the moments of inertia on nine slash 11 </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't make any sense.</v>

2234
01:56:59.010 --> 01:57:00.780
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you understand them,</v>

2235
01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:06.560
<v Speaker 3>once you understood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to hang the engine off the </v>

2236
01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:06.560
<v Speaker 3>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not a wise move.</v>

2237
01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:08.460
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to let up on the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're in a corner,</v>

2238
01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:10.430
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with,</v>

2239
01:57:10.431 --> 01:57:10.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

2240
01:57:10.681 --> 01:57:11.090
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2241
01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:12.360
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with something,</v>

2242
01:57:12.361 --> 01:57:15.720
<v Speaker 3>that's where the engine is mounted over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rear axle or off the rear axle,</v>

2243
01:57:15.721 --> 01:57:20.721
<v Speaker 3>towards the rear is that you pull them </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment of inertia is fundamentally </v>

2244
01:57:20.721 --> 01:57:20.721
<v Speaker 3>screwed.</v>

2245
01:57:20.721 --> 01:57:21.750
<v Speaker 3>You cannot solve this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unsolvable.</v>

2246
01:57:22.540 --> 01:57:24.240
<v Speaker 3>You're screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pull them over to know Sherry.</v>

2247
01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:26.880
<v Speaker 3>You're screwed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2248
01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:27.910
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>

2249
01:57:27.911 --> 01:57:32.911
<v Speaker 3>If you spun the car like a top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's your polar moment of </v>

2250
01:57:32.911 --> 01:57:33.870
<v Speaker 3>inertia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just,</v>

2251
01:57:35.590 --> 01:57:40.590
<v Speaker 3>I promised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't swear to this show by the </v>

2252
01:57:40.590 --> 01:57:40.590
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really to who it was a friend.</v>

2253
01:57:40.590 --> 01:57:43.020
<v Speaker 3>Tell that friend to go fuck himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who told you not to swear.</v>

2254
01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:48.720
<v Speaker 3>Read a good friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You realize you're fucking Elan Musk can</v>

2255
01:57:49.591 --> 01:57:50.520
<v Speaker 3>do whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2256
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:54.840
<v Speaker 3>If you ever get confused,</v>
<v Speaker 3>call me elsewhere and private.</v>

2257
01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:59.130
<v Speaker 3>Swear up a storm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just say fricking fun way.</v>

2258
01:57:59.131 --> 01:58:04.131
<v Speaker 3>There's like old house moms that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>

2259
01:58:07.070 --> 01:58:08.760
<v Speaker 3>That's fricking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2260
01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:10.500
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Porsche,</v>

2261
01:58:10.501 --> 01:58:14.850
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of incredible how well Porsche</v>
<v Speaker 3>handles given that it's the physics,</v>

2262
01:58:15.250 --> 01:58:17.760
<v Speaker 3>the moments of inertia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So messed up,</v>

2263
01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:20.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to actually still make it work well is,</v>

2264
01:58:20.690 --> 01:58:21.690
<v Speaker 3>is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2265
01:58:21.691 --> 01:58:26.691
<v Speaker 3>if you know how to turn into the corner </v>
<v Speaker 3>and once you get used to the feeling of </v>

2266
01:58:26.691 --> 01:58:26.691
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's actual benefits to it.</v>

2267
01:58:26.910 --> 01:58:27.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2268
01:58:27.281 --> 01:58:31.470
<v Speaker 3>there are some benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy the car I had before.</v>

2269
01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:33.570
<v Speaker 3>Tesla was a nine slash seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2270
01:58:34.460 --> 01:58:35.190
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

2271
01:58:35.191 --> 01:58:37.900
<v Speaker 3>seven or six or seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2272
01:58:38.070 --> 01:58:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm great car man.</v>

2273
01:58:41.530 --> 01:58:46.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean particularly with other Porsche </v>

2274
01:58:46.530 --> 01:58:48.040
<v Speaker 3>stutter when they had the variable veins</v>
<v Speaker 3>a turbo and yet don't have the turbo </v>

2275
01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:48.040
<v Speaker 3>lag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was great.</v>

2276
01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:48.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was really great.</v>

2277
01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:51.040
<v Speaker 3>The turbo lag was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2278
01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:53.920
<v Speaker 3>your floor it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like photo home,</v>

2279
01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:58.150
<v Speaker 3>call your mom the older one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but an hour later the car accelerates.</v>

2280
01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:02.140
<v Speaker 3>Super dangerous too because in the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>world starts spinning.</v>

2281
01:59:02.141 --> 01:59:03.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2282
01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:08.340
<v Speaker 3>There's something fun about it though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like feeling that rear weight kicking </v>

2283
01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:08.430
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2284
01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:10.810
<v Speaker 3>and again I could feel to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2285
01:59:10.850 --> 01:59:11.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2286
01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:14.350
<v Speaker 3>But that's what I was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier about that</v>

2287
01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:17.060
<v Speaker 1>card that I have 93,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11.</v>

2288
01:59:17.061 --> 01:59:19.700
<v Speaker 1>It's just there's not fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

2289
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:24.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not the best handling car but it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more satisfying than any other car I </v>

2290
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:28.200
<v Speaker 1>have because it's so mechanical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything about it like crack</v>

2291
01:59:28.201 --> 01:59:33.201
<v Speaker 1>holes and bumps and it gives you all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this feedback and I take it to the </v>

2292
01:59:33.201 --> 01:59:37.511
<v Speaker 1>comedy store because when I get there I </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like my brain is just pop in and </v>

2293
01:59:37.511 --> 01:59:41.771
<v Speaker 1>it's on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a strategy for me now that I </v>

2294
01:59:41.771 --> 01:59:45.370
<v Speaker 1>really stopped driving other cars there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drive that car there just for the </v>

2295
01:59:45.370 --> 01:59:47.670
<v Speaker 1>brain juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just for the owner.</v>

2296
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:48.830
<v Speaker 1>The interaction.</v>

2297
01:59:50.090 --> 01:59:55.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean you should try model s p 100 d </v>
<v Speaker 3>will blow your mind your skull.</v>

2298
01:59:55.490 --> 01:59:56.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2299
01:59:56.810 --> 01:59:59.200
<v Speaker 3>Tell me what to order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll order one LSP,</v>

2300
01:59:59.290 --> 02:00:00.470
<v Speaker 3>100 d.</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2301
02:00:00.530 --> 02:00:02.540
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the Tesla car that I drive.</v>

2302
02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:03.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2303
02:00:03.321 --> 02:00:05.480
<v Speaker 3>I'll get with the car you drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2304
02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:07.380
<v Speaker 3>It will blow your mind out of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>spirit.</v>

2305
02:00:07.490 --> 02:00:11.150
<v Speaker 3>I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can I drive 300 miles?</v>

2306
02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:14.420
<v Speaker 3>That's good for la.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Regular days.</v>

2307
02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:16.520
<v Speaker 3>You'll never notice the battery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never,</v>

2308
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:21.550
<v Speaker 3>never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How hard is it to get like one of them </v>

2309
02:00:21.550 --> 02:00:22.340
<v Speaker 3>crazy plugs installed in your house?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That difficult?</v>

2310
02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:24.320
<v Speaker 3>Now it's super easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2311
02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:25.760
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a dryer plug.</v>

2312
02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:29.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like a dryer outlet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't you come up with some crazy tiles</v>

2313
02:00:29.151 --> 02:00:31.670
<v Speaker 3>for your roof that are solar paneled?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2314
02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:33.230
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're have it on my roof right now.</v>

2315
02:00:33.231 --> 02:00:34.730
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying it out.</v>

2316
02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:36.950
<v Speaker 3>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the thing is it takes while to like</v>

2317
02:00:36.951 --> 02:00:39.680
<v Speaker 3>test roof stuff because roofs have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>last a long time.</v>

2318
02:00:39.930 --> 02:00:44.930
<v Speaker 3>So like your watch your roof to last </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 30 years for a regular groove now.</v>

2319
02:00:45.410 --> 02:00:48.050
<v Speaker 3>So there's two versions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like the solar panels you put on</v>

2320
02:00:48.051 --> 02:00:53.051
<v Speaker 3>a roof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like depends on whether your roofs </v>

2321
02:00:53.051 --> 02:00:54.640
<v Speaker 3>new or old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're roof new you don't want to </v>

2322
02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:57.091
<v Speaker 3>replace the roof,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to put solar panels on the </v>

2323
02:00:57.091 --> 02:00:57.091
<v Speaker 3>roof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2324
02:00:57.091 --> 02:00:57.091
<v Speaker 3>so that's like retrofit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2325
02:00:57.170 --> 02:00:59.240
<v Speaker 3>and they were trying to make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>retrofit Pendleton Grill Nice.</v>

2326
02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:00.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

2327
02:01:00.530 --> 02:01:03.160
<v Speaker 3>but then the new product we're coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>out with is if you,</v>

2328
02:01:03.161 --> 02:01:08.161
<v Speaker 3>if you have a roof that's either you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>building a house or you're going to </v>

2329
02:01:08.161 --> 02:01:08.830
<v Speaker 3>replace your roof anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you make the site,</v>

2330
02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:13.840
<v Speaker 3>the tiles have solar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>solar cells embedded in the tiles and </v>

2331
02:01:14.451 --> 02:01:19.451
<v Speaker 3>then it's quite a tricky thing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to not see the solar cell </v>

2332
02:01:19.451 --> 02:01:21.730
<v Speaker 3>behind the glass tile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2333
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:26.210
<v Speaker 3>so you have to really work with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>glass and,</v>

2334
02:01:26.211 --> 02:01:26.650
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

2335
02:01:26.830 --> 02:01:31.830
<v Speaker 3>and the various coatings and layers so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you don't see the solar cell behind</v>

2336
02:01:32.481 --> 02:01:34.250
<v Speaker 3>the glass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise it doesn't look right.</v>

2337
02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:36.350
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really tricky.</v>

2338
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:38.300
<v Speaker 3>There's this shame and put it up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2339
02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:40.150
<v Speaker 3>that looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2340
02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:43.390
<v Speaker 3>like if you look closely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see if you're zooming in,</v>

2341
02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:44.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see the,</v>

2342
02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:49.940
<v Speaker 3>you can see the cell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you zoom out you don't see the </v>

2343
02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:49.940
<v Speaker 3>sale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2344
02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:52.250
<v Speaker 3>Well it looks cool though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hard.</v>

2345
02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:55.130
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have sunlight go through.</v>

2346
02:01:55.420 --> 02:01:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when it gets reflected back out,</v>

2347
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:59.540
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2348
02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:02.000
<v Speaker 3>it hides the fact that there's a sale </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2349
02:02:02.090 --> 02:02:07.090
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are those available to the consumer </v>

2350
02:02:07.090 --> 02:02:07.090
<v Speaker 3>right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2351
02:02:07.090 --> 02:02:08.690
<v Speaker 3>we have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think those on that roof right there.</v>

2352
02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:10.250
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

2353
02:02:11.210 --> 02:02:12.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that looks good.</v>

2354
02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

2355
02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:16.180
<v Speaker 3>I liked that one too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smart.</v>

2356
02:02:16.670 --> 02:02:21.670
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you get that kind of fake Spanish </v>

2357
02:02:21.670 --> 02:02:21.670
<v Speaker 3>looking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like French late.</v>

2358
02:02:21.670 --> 02:02:24.560
<v Speaker 3>That's why people in Connecticut smoking</v>
<v Speaker 3>pipes will get that one.</v>

2359
02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's bad ass dude.</v>

2360
02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:31.010
<v Speaker 3>So those will actually work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe you.</v>

2361
02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:31.910
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2362
02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:36.920
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the solar panels that are on that house </v>

2363
02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:39.641
<v Speaker 3>that we just looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that sufficient to power the entire </v>

2364
02:02:39.641 --> 02:02:39.641
<v Speaker 3>home?</v>

2365
02:02:40.010 --> 02:02:42.790
<v Speaker 3>It depends on your energy on how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2366
02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:43.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2367
02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:47.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>generally yes.</v>

2368
02:02:47.630 --> 02:02:50.540
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's probably for most it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to vary,</v>

2369
02:02:50.541 --> 02:02:55.541
<v Speaker 3>but anywhere from more than you need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe half,</v>

2370
02:02:57.290 --> 02:03:02.290
<v Speaker 3>like half to one point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five of the energy that you need </v>

2371
02:03:02.290 --> 02:03:06.760
<v Speaker 3>depending on how much roof you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>relative to living space and how </v>

2372
02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:08.870
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous you are with the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>TV is no problem.</v>

2373
02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:10.320
<v Speaker 3>Air Conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>air conditioning,</v>

2374
02:03:10.930 --> 02:03:14.990
<v Speaker 3>air conditioning is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have an efficient air conditioner</v>

2375
02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:20.680
<v Speaker 3>and you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and depending on how like are you at </v>

2376
02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:22.710
<v Speaker 3>conditioning rooms when they don't need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be air conditioned,</v>

2377
02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:27.730
<v Speaker 3>which is very common because it's a pain</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the neck and it was like programming </v>

2378
02:03:27.730 --> 02:03:30.451
<v Speaker 3>or BCR.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like right now it's just blinking </v>

2379
02:03:30.451 --> 02:03:33.941
<v Speaker 3>12.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell people just like to hell with </v>

2380
02:03:33.941 --> 02:03:35.800
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna make it this temperature </v>

2381
02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:37.301
<v Speaker 3>all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't have a smart home where if you're </v>

2382
02:03:37.301 --> 02:03:37.301
<v Speaker 3>in the room then it stays cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2383
02:03:37.301 --> 02:03:42.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should predict when you're going to </v>

2384
02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:42.860
<v Speaker 3>be home and then cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The room,</v>

2385
02:03:43.130 --> 02:03:47.060
<v Speaker 3>the rooms that you're likely to use with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of intelligence.</v>

2386
02:03:47.061 --> 02:03:49.520
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about like genius home</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2387
02:03:49.521 --> 02:03:52.220
<v Speaker 3>We're just talking like elementary basic</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2388
02:03:54.230 --> 02:03:59.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you could hook that into the </v>

2389
02:03:59.230 --> 02:03:59.230
<v Speaker 3>car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like knows you're coming home.</v>

2390
02:03:59.230 --> 02:03:59.720
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no point in calling the </v>
<v Speaker 3>home,</v>

2391
02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:02.570
<v Speaker 3>keeping the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeping the home really cool when you're</v>

2392
02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:04.840
<v Speaker 3>not there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can tell that you're coming home.</v>

2393
02:04:04.850 --> 02:04:06.620
<v Speaker 3>What's going to cool it to the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>temperature,</v>

2394
02:04:06.621 --> 02:04:11.621
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have an editor that works with your </v>

2395
02:04:11.621 --> 02:04:12.940
<v Speaker 3>solar panels or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2396
02:04:13.330 --> 02:04:18.330
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do and we need to hook it into the </v>

2397
02:04:18.330 --> 02:04:18.330
<v Speaker 3>air conditioning to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really make the air conditioning work.</v>

2398
02:04:18.330 --> 02:04:20.410
<v Speaker 3>Have you thought about creating an air </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning system?</v>

2399
02:04:21.250 --> 02:04:26.250
<v Speaker 3>I know you have a trick question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cannot answer questions about ritual </v>

2400
02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:31.420
<v Speaker 3>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just let it go.</v>

2401
02:04:31.421 --> 02:04:34.240
<v Speaker 3>We'll move on to the next thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that would be an interesting idea.</v>

2402
02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:37.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say radiant heating,</v>

2403
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.830
<v Speaker 3>all that</v>

2404
02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:40.310
<v Speaker 1>good ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you,</v>

2405
02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:45.380
<v Speaker 1>when you think about the efficiency of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these homes and you think about </v>

2406
02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:49.670
<v Speaker 1>implementing solar power and battery </v>
<v Speaker 1>power and is there anything else that </v>

2407
02:04:50.131 --> 02:04:52.080
<v Speaker 1>people are missing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any other.</v>

2408
02:04:52.081 --> 02:04:57.081
<v Speaker 1>Like I just saw a smartwatch that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>powered by the heat of the human body.</v>

2409
02:04:58.770 --> 02:05:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Some new technology is able to fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>power that way.</v>

2410
02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's fully or if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this watch right here.</v>

2411
02:05:05.221 --> 02:05:10.221
<v Speaker 1>This is a casio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called a pro tech and it's in like </v>

2412
02:05:10.221 --> 02:05:14.901
<v Speaker 1>an outdoors watch and solar powered and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so it has the ability to operate for a </v>

2413
02:05:14.901 --> 02:05:18.270
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of time on solar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have it exposed,</v>

2414
02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:21.180
<v Speaker 1>it could function for a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time on solar.</v>

2415
02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2416
02:05:21.900 --> 02:05:23.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2417
02:05:23.281 --> 02:05:26.160
<v Speaker 1>there's this health lighting watches </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's just got to wait in the watch</v>

2418
02:05:26.161 --> 02:05:31.161
<v Speaker 1>and as you move your wrist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight moves from one side to the </v>

2419
02:05:31.161 --> 02:05:31.161
<v Speaker 1>other and it winds the watch up.</v>

2420
02:05:31.170 --> 02:05:32.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2421
02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that Rolex is that it's all</v>

2422
02:05:35.311 --> 02:05:40.311
<v Speaker 1>done mechanically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no batteries in there and it's </v>

2423
02:05:40.311 --> 02:05:40.311
<v Speaker 1>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2424
02:05:40.311 --> 02:05:43.551
<v Speaker 1>you could do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Create a little charger that's based on </v>

2425
02:05:43.551 --> 02:05:46.880
<v Speaker 1>a risk movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really depends on how much energy or </v>

2426
02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:46.880
<v Speaker 1>what she uses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2427
02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:50.811
<v Speaker 1>what's fucked up about that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We accept a certain amount of like </v>

2428
02:05:50.811 --> 02:05:52.200
<v Speaker 1>fuckery with those watches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I brought my watch,</v>

2429
02:05:52.210 --> 02:05:57.210
<v Speaker 1>I have a rolex that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Lorenzo gave me and I brought </v>

2430
02:05:57.210 --> 02:06:00.711
<v Speaker 1>it to the watch store and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing's always fast.</v>

2431
02:06:01.890 --> 02:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always like after a couple months </v>

2432
02:06:06.890 --> 02:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>it's like five minutes fast and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

2433
02:06:07.630 --> 02:06:08.130
<v Speaker 1>bigly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2434
02:06:08.350 --> 02:06:09.770
<v Speaker 1>It's just what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2435
02:06:09.810 --> 02:06:11.220
<v Speaker 1>well hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go.</v>

2436
02:06:11.221 --> 02:06:13.860
<v Speaker 1>So you telling me that it just is always</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be fast.</v>

2437
02:06:13.890 --> 02:06:14.730
<v Speaker 1>They just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2438
02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:17.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just like every few months you </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta reset.</v>

2439
02:06:17.251 --> 02:06:19.080
<v Speaker 1>It seems like they should recalibrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>

2440
02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:20.730
<v Speaker 1>They can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tried.</v>

2441
02:06:20.850 --> 02:06:24.540
<v Speaker 1>They see every few months with it's four</v>
<v Speaker 1>months or five months or six months.</v>

2442
02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:26.940
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a couple minutes fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2443
02:06:26.941 --> 02:06:31.941
<v Speaker 1>It seems like they should really </v>
<v Speaker 1>recalibrate that because if it's always </v>

2444
02:06:31.941 --> 02:06:34.530
<v Speaker 1>fast you can just delete those minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to fucking kicked down the door</v>

2445
02:06:34.531 --> 02:06:36.960
<v Speaker 1>at Rolex and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bitches are lazy.</v>

2446
02:06:39.410 --> 02:06:44.410
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of amazing that you can keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>time mechanically on a wristwatch with </v>

2447
02:06:44.410 --> 02:06:44.670
<v Speaker 1>these tiny little gears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2448
02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole luxury watch market is </v>

2449
02:06:49.790 --> 02:06:49.790
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2450
02:06:49.790 --> 02:06:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2451
02:06:50.350 --> 02:06:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like I don't buy them.</v>

2452
02:06:54.421 --> 02:06:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I bought them as gifts so I don't buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>them for myself,</v>

2453
02:06:56.611 --> 02:07:01.611
<v Speaker 1>but when I look at them online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's million dollar watches out </v>

2454
02:07:01.611 --> 02:07:03.540
<v Speaker 1>there now that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have like little rotating moons and</v>

2455
02:07:03.541 --> 02:07:06.720
<v Speaker 1>stars and they live like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this thing.</v>

2456
02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:09.980
<v Speaker 1>How much does that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie [inaudible] preposterous.</v>

2457
02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:15.830
<v Speaker 1>I like gears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just love them and it looked </v>

2458
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:18.950
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's some of these people that </v>

2459
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:20.781
<v Speaker 1>are just taking it right in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They buying these watches for like </v>

2460
02:07:20.781 --> 02:07:20.781
<v Speaker 1>$750,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2461
02:07:20.781 --> 02:07:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a timex son.</v>

2462
02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not any better than some cassio </v>

2463
02:07:27.380 --> 02:07:27.390
<v Speaker 1>that you could just buy online.</v>

2464
02:07:27.420 --> 02:07:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that though.</v>

2465
02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

2466
02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:35.360
<v Speaker 1>If you're a person that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just want to know the time you want </v>

2467
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:39.370
<v Speaker 1>craftsmanship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want some artisans touch.</v>

2468
02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:44.820
<v Speaker 1>You want innovation in terms of like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person figuring out how gears and cogs </v>

2469
02:07:46.061 --> 02:07:50.890
<v Speaker 1>all line up perfectly to every time it </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns over,</v>

2470
02:07:50.891 --> 02:07:54.070
<v Speaker 1>it's basically a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just.</v>

2471
02:07:54.250 --> 02:07:58.390
<v Speaker 1>There's art to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just telling time,</v>

2472
02:07:58.590 --> 02:08:00.040
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like this watch a lot,</v>

2473
02:08:00.041 --> 02:08:01.960
<v Speaker 1>but if it got hit by a rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be sad.</v>

2474
02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:07.560
<v Speaker 1>It's just a watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mass produced thing that runs on </v>

2475
02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:09.680
<v Speaker 1>some courts battery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those things that's.</v>

2476
02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:10.810
<v Speaker 1>There's art to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2477
02:08:10.811 --> 02:08:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

2478
02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2479
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2480
02:08:15.250 --> 02:08:17.260
<v Speaker 1>There's something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something amazing about it.</v>

2481
02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:22.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it represents the human </v>

2482
02:08:22.500 --> 02:08:22.500
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just.</v>

2483
02:08:22.500 --> 02:08:25.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a electronic innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something.</v>

2484
02:08:25.991 --> 02:08:29.520
<v Speaker 1>There's a person's work in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2485
02:08:30.190 --> 02:08:32.980
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have a watch on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2486
02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:34.420
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a watch.</v>

2487
02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:39.480
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My phone tells the time point,</v>

2488
02:08:41.110 --> 02:08:42.670
<v Speaker 1>but if you lose your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you wait?</v>

2489
02:08:42.700 --> 02:08:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me guess.</v>

2490
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:48.340
<v Speaker 1>You are a no case guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

2491
02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:53.640
<v Speaker 1>On the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grasse Tyson,</v>

2492
02:08:53.650 --> 02:08:55.540
<v Speaker 1>neela grass titus who was in here last </v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

2493
02:08:55.830 --> 02:08:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm marveled at his ability to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>through life without a case.</v>

2494
02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:01.210
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2495
02:09:01.211 --> 02:09:04.660
<v Speaker 1>he takes his phone and he flips it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between his fingers like,</v>

2496
02:09:04.690 --> 02:09:05.660
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a.</v>

2497
02:09:05.770 --> 02:09:10.770
<v Speaker 1>A soldier would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His rifle or his roles that shed in </v>

2498
02:09:10.770 --> 02:09:10.770
<v Speaker 1>between his fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2499
02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Marvelous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2500
02:09:12.130 --> 02:09:13.630
<v Speaker 1>He says that's the reason why they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2501
02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:18.780
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at someone who has a </v>

2502
02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:18.780
<v Speaker 1>rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would they do that?</v>

2503
02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Why would they flip it around like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2504
02:09:21.370 --> 02:09:24.640
<v Speaker 1>So that when it goes to drop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have it in their hand,</v>

2505
02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:27.970
<v Speaker 1>they catch it quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what he does with his phone.</v>

2506
02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:29.590
<v Speaker 1>He's just flipping his phone around all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

2507
02:09:30.430 --> 02:09:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I got that in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping it holds joint,</v>

2508
02:09:34.330 --> 02:09:37.020
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to open it just as a host,</v>

2509
02:09:37.021 --> 02:09:38.620
<v Speaker 1>a whole storage store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things in there,</v>

2510
02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:42.220
<v Speaker 1>but like try to put a joint in there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>close it.</v>

2511
02:09:42.310 --> 02:09:47.250
<v Speaker 1>You put like one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one blunt one,</v>

2512
02:09:48.450 --> 02:09:50.550
<v Speaker 1>but it seems pretentious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2513
02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:54.660
<v Speaker 1>that's the idea behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought it when I was in Mexico because</v>

2514
02:09:54.661 --> 02:09:59.020
<v Speaker 1>I figured it'd be a good size to hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>joints or</v>

2515
02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:07.690
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a joint or is it a cigar?</v>

2516
02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:10.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>

2517
02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:12.790
<v Speaker 1>marijuana inside of a tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2518
02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:15.400
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like plot plot tobacco never had</v>

2519
02:10:15.401 --> 02:10:16.060
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2520
02:10:16.061 --> 02:10:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I think I tried one once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

2521
02:10:17.591 --> 02:10:21.180
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably can't because stockholders,</v>

2522
02:10:21.190 --> 02:10:23.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2523
02:10:23.801 --> 02:10:24.580
<v Speaker 1>it's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2524
02:10:24.630 --> 02:10:25.930
<v Speaker 1>It's totally legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2525
02:10:26.740 --> 02:10:31.740
<v Speaker 1>How does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do People get upset at you if you do </v>

2526
02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:33.130
<v Speaker 1>certain things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A backhoe and marijuana in there,</v>

2527
02:10:33.790 --> 02:10:34.060
<v Speaker 1>that's all</v>

2528
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:34.370
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

2529
02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Did the combination of tobacco and </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana is wonderful?</v>

2530
02:10:42.090 --> 02:10:45.750
<v Speaker 1>First turned onto it by Charlie Murphy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then reignited by Dave Chappelle</v>

2531
02:10:47.180 --> 02:10:49.360
<v Speaker 3>plus whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2532
02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:51.640
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Balances it out.</v>

2533
02:10:53.420 --> 02:10:55.520
<v Speaker 3>Alcohol is a drug that's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>grandfathered in.</v>

2534
02:10:56.210 --> 02:10:56.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just.</v>

2535
02:10:57.180 --> 02:11:00.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a drug that gets a bad rap because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just have a little.</v>

2536
02:11:00.421 --> 02:11:02.790
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

2537
02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little sip here and there and just </v>

2538
02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:10.530
<v Speaker 1>your inhibitions are relaxed and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows your true self and hopefully </v>

2539
02:11:10.530 --> 02:11:12.540
<v Speaker 1>you're more joyous and friendly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy and everything's good.</v>

2540
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:16.350
<v Speaker 1>The real worry is that people that can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>handle it,</v>

2541
02:11:16.351 --> 02:11:21.351
<v Speaker 1>like the real worried about people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>can handle cars that can go zero to 60 </v>

2542
02:11:21.351 --> 02:11:25.791
<v Speaker 1>in one point nine seconds or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever considered something that </v>

2543
02:11:26.550 --> 02:11:31.550
<v Speaker 1>like imagine if one day everyone has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>car that's on the same,</v>

2544
02:11:31.860 --> 02:11:36.860
<v Speaker 1>at least technological standard is one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your cars and everyone agrees that </v>

2545
02:11:37.410 --> 02:11:40.530
<v Speaker 1>the smart thing to do is not just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have bumpers,</v>

2546
02:11:40.890 --> 02:11:44.160
<v Speaker 1>but to perhaps have some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnetic repellent device,</v>

2547
02:11:44.370 --> 02:11:49.370
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some electro magnetic field around the </v>

2548
02:11:49.370 --> 02:11:49.590
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As cars come close to each other,</v>

2549
02:11:49.591 --> 02:11:54.591
<v Speaker 1>they automatically radically decelerate </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of magnets or something.</v>

2550
02:11:56.230 --> 02:12:01.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean our cars brake automatically </v>

2551
02:12:01.230 --> 02:12:01.230
<v Speaker 3>break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2552
02:12:01.230 --> 02:12:01.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they see things,</v>

2553
02:12:01.230 --> 02:12:05.580
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look a physical barrier like a.</v>

2554
02:12:06.010 --> 02:12:07.370
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wheels work pretty well.</v>

2555
02:12:07.630 --> 02:12:12.630
<v Speaker 3>We'll know pretty well decelerated at </v>
<v Speaker 3>one point,</v>

2556
02:12:12.641 --> 02:12:14.920
<v Speaker 3>one to one point two g's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>

2557
02:12:15.290 --> 02:12:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Is there a concern that one day all your</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars will be on the road and there </v>

2558
02:12:20.290 --> 02:12:23.440
<v Speaker 1>they'll still be regular people with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular cars 20,</v>

2559
02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:28.460
<v Speaker 1>30 years from now that'll get in the mix</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be the the main problem?</v>

2560
02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:36.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was sort of like know it was </v>

2561
02:12:36.180 --> 02:12:38.401
<v Speaker 3>a time of transition where there were </v>
<v Speaker 3>horses and gasoline cars in the road at </v>

2562
02:12:38.401 --> 02:12:39.100
<v Speaker 3>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been pretty weird.</v>

2563
02:12:39.710 --> 02:12:41.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be the weirdest.</v>

2564
02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Horses were tricky.</v>

2565
02:12:43.541 --> 02:12:46.360
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be back in a Manhattan</v>
<v Speaker 3>had like 300,000</v>

2566
02:12:46.361 --> 02:12:50.740
<v Speaker 3>horses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You figure like horse lives.</v>

2567
02:12:50.741 --> 02:12:53.050
<v Speaker 3>Fifteen years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got 20,000</v>

2568
02:12:53.051 --> 02:12:56.890
<v Speaker 3>horses that Robin Dad every day or every</v>
<v Speaker 3>year I should say every year.</v>

2569
02:12:56.891 --> 02:12:57.730
<v Speaker 3>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>horses.</v>

2570
02:12:57.731 --> 02:13:02.731
<v Speaker 3>If this 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>horses in 15 year lifespan back in the </v>

2571
02:13:02.731 --> 02:13:05.740
<v Speaker 3>gangs in New York days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That movie.</v>

2572
02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of dead horses now.</v>

2573
02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:11.250
<v Speaker 3>You need a dead horse to move the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2574
02:13:11.310 --> 02:13:16.310
<v Speaker 3>The probably get pretty freaked out if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to a dead horse because they </v>

2575
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.940
<v Speaker 3>know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2576
02:13:16.941 --> 02:13:20.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's pretty weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2577
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:24.550
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine dragon this dead horse </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and I'm a horse.</v>

2578
02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:27.750
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop</v>

2579
02:13:28.050 --> 02:13:33.050
<v Speaker 1>and think about your role in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever stop and think about your </v>

2580
02:13:33.050 --> 02:13:34.950
<v Speaker 1>role in the culture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because me as a person who never met you</v>

2581
02:13:34.951 --> 02:13:36.780

<v Speaker 1>culture?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Because me as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ever met you until today.</v>

2606
02:14:35.210 --> 02:14:36.980
<v Speaker 1>I've always looked at you and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2607
02:14:36.981 --> 02:14:39.290
<v Speaker 1>like how's this guy just keep inventing </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you keep coming up with all these</v>

2609
02:14:41.631 --> 02:14:46.370
<v Speaker 1>new devices and what do you ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider how anew?</v>

2610
02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a dream once that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>million tesla's instead of like one </v>

2611
02:14:51.921 --> 02:14:53.690
<v Speaker 1>tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a million.</v>

2612
02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Tesla's not Chesley the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Nicola.</v>

2613
02:14:57.470 --> 02:14:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

2614
02:14:58.341 --> 02:15:03.341
<v Speaker 1>And that in his day there was a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like him who were radically </v>

2615
02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:05.540
<v Speaker 1>innovative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird dream,</v>

2616
02:15:05.541 --> 02:15:10.541
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so strange and I've had it more </v>

2617
02:15:10.541 --> 02:15:11.330
<v Speaker 1>once the results in a very rapid </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology innovation,</v>

2618
02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:13.790
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the only dreams in my life.</v>

2619
02:15:13.791 --> 02:15:15.410
<v Speaker 1>I've had more than one time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2620
02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Like where I've woken up and it's in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same dream,</v>

2621
02:15:17.780 --> 02:15:22.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the same dream and in this dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 19 forties,</v>

2622
02:15:22.370 --> 02:15:27.050
<v Speaker 1>19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone is severely advanced.</v>

2623
02:15:27.050 --> 02:15:32.050
<v Speaker 1>There's flying blimps with lcd screens </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the side of them and everything is </v>

2624
02:15:32.050 --> 02:15:36.131
<v Speaker 1>bizarre and strange and it stuck with me</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever it.</v>

2625
02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Obviously this is just a stupid dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason,</v>

2626
02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:42.890
<v Speaker 1>all these years that stuck with me like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes one man,</v>

2627
02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:48.220
<v Speaker 1>like Nikola Tesla to have more than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred inventions that were patents.</v>

2628
02:15:49.581 --> 02:15:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had some pretty great,</v>

2629
02:15:52.190 --> 02:15:55.850
<v Speaker 1>pretty fucking amazing ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2630
02:15:55.970 --> 02:16:00.260
<v Speaker 1>But there was in his day there was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>few people like him because it's true.</v>

2631
02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:04.790
<v Speaker 1>What if there was a million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what exists advance very quickly.</v>

2632
02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's not a million.</v>

2633
02:16:06.621 --> 02:16:11.621
<v Speaker 1>Elon Musk's is one motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have think about that?</v>

2634
02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:17.320
<v Speaker 1>We just try to not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

2635
02:16:24.690 --> 02:16:29.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you'd necessarily want to </v>

2636
02:16:29.690 --> 02:16:29.690
<v Speaker 1>be me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

2637
02:16:29.690 --> 02:16:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2638
02:16:30.510 --> 02:16:32.890
<v Speaker 3>what's the worst part about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people would like it that much,</v>

2639
02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:35.000
<v Speaker 3>well most people wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can't be you.</v>

2640
02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:39.460
<v Speaker 3>So that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like some superhero type Shit,</v>

2641
02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:45.420
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't want to be spiderman rather </v>

2642
02:16:45.420 --> 02:16:46.270
<v Speaker 3>this sleep tight and Gotham city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope he's out there doing his job.</v>

2643
02:16:48.450 --> 02:16:50.410
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to turn it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2644
02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:53.820
<v Speaker 3>What's the hardest part?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might sound great to me,</v>

2645
02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:59.340
<v Speaker 3>but what if it doesn't turn off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I showed you the isolation tank and </v>

2646
02:16:59.340 --> 02:17:03.790
<v Speaker 3>you've never experienced that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that could help you turn it off </v>

2647
02:17:03.790 --> 02:17:05.470
<v Speaker 3>a little bit just for the night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2648
02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:09.250
<v Speaker 3>just give you a little bit of sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit of perspective is magnesium</v>

2649
02:17:09.251 --> 02:17:11.110
<v Speaker 3>that you get from the water as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes you,</v>

2650
02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:14.140
<v Speaker 3>makes you sleep easier because the water</v>
<v Speaker 3>has epsom salts in it,</v>

2651
02:17:15.010 --> 02:17:19.630
<v Speaker 3>but maybe some sort of strategy for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrificing your,</v>

2652
02:17:19.631 --> 02:17:24.631
<v Speaker 3>a biologic or not sacrificing but </v>
<v Speaker 3>enhancing your biological recovery time </v>

2653
02:17:25.210 --> 02:17:30.210
<v Speaker 3>by figuring out a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's through meditation or some </v>

2654
02:17:30.210 --> 02:17:33.040
<v Speaker 3>other ways to shut off that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That thing at night.</v>

2655
02:17:34.450 --> 02:17:38.620
<v Speaker 3>Like you must have like a constant </v>
<v Speaker 3>stream of ideas.</v>

2656
02:17:38.621 --> 02:17:39.880
<v Speaker 3>It's running through your head all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2657
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Getting text messages from checks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2658
02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:46.910
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2659
02:17:47.390 --> 02:17:50.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting text messages from friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

2660
02:17:50.420 --> 02:17:52.730
<v Speaker 3>what the hell are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smoking weed?</v>

2661
02:17:53.450 --> 02:17:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Is that bad for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's legal.</v>

2662
02:17:56.390 --> 02:17:58.160
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be an approved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

2663
02:17:58.290 --> 02:17:59.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2664
02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:03.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a regular smoker of weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How often you smoke it?</v>

2665
02:18:04.370 --> 02:18:05.210
<v Speaker 3>Almost never.</v>

2666
02:18:05.610 --> 02:18:06.040
<v Speaker 5>Mm.</v>

2667
02:18:08.670 --> 02:18:09.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2668
02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:12.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't actually notice any effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2669
02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:14.580
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a time where,</v>

2670
02:18:14.670 --> 02:18:18.990
<v Speaker 3>I think it was ram das or someone gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>some Buddhist monk bunch acid.</v>

2671
02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he ate it and it had no effect on </v>

2672
02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:26.040
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I doubt that I would say that too,</v>

2673
02:18:26.041 --> 02:18:31.041
<v Speaker 3>but I've never meditated to the level </v>
<v Speaker 3>that some of these people that were </v>

2674
02:18:31.041 --> 02:18:33.540
<v Speaker 3>there constantly meditating all day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have any material possessions</v>

2675
02:18:33.930 --> 02:18:38.160
<v Speaker 3>and all of their energy is spent trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to achieve a certain mindset.</v>

2676
02:18:38.430 --> 02:18:43.430
<v Speaker 3>I would like to cynically deny that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to cynically say contagious </v>

2677
02:18:43.430 --> 02:18:48.321
<v Speaker 3>fucking think the same way I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just hang out with flip flops on </v>

2678
02:18:48.321 --> 02:18:51.970
<v Speaker 3>and make weird noises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe now you know,</v>

2679
02:18:52.860 --> 02:18:57.860
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people like reed and </v>

2680
02:18:57.860 --> 02:19:00.450
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't find that it is very good to</v>

2681
02:19:00.451 --> 02:19:02.880
<v Speaker 3>full productivity for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for me,</v>

2682
02:19:03.390 --> 02:19:04.160
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely.</v>

2683
02:19:04.260 --> 02:19:05.820
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that for someone like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2684
02:19:05.821 --> 02:19:10.020
<v Speaker 3>it's not someone like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2685
02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:12.680
<v Speaker 3>it'd be more like a cup coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2686
02:19:12.690 --> 02:19:14.850
<v Speaker 3>You want your latte?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2687
02:19:14.851 --> 02:19:16.470
<v Speaker 3>That's more like the opposite of a cup </v>
<v Speaker 3>of coffee,</v>

2688
02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:18.590
<v Speaker 3>a cup of coffee and reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2689
02:19:18.620 --> 02:19:19.650
<v Speaker 3>weed is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2690
02:19:19.651 --> 02:19:22.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying you would like more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more like,</v>

2691
02:19:22.111 --> 02:19:24.090
<v Speaker 3>will it be beneficial to you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like coffee.</v>

2692
02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:27.530
<v Speaker 3>I like to get things done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to be useful.</v>

2693
02:19:27.940 --> 02:19:28.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2694
02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:32.210
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the hardest things to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to be useful.</v>

2695
02:19:32.300 --> 02:19:37.300
<v Speaker 1>When you say you like to get things done</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like what you get to </v>

2696
02:19:37.300 --> 02:19:38.510
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction when you complete a </v>
<v Speaker 1>project,</v>

2697
02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:43.540
<v Speaker 1>when something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you invent comes to </v>

2698
02:19:43.540 --> 02:19:46.121
<v Speaker 1>fruition and you see people enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That feeling yes.</v>

2699
02:19:46.280 --> 02:19:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Doing something useful for other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I liked doing.</v>

2700
02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:55.440
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2701
02:19:56.220 --> 02:20:01.220
<v Speaker 1>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that is maybe the way </v>

2702
02:20:01.220 --> 02:20:04.851
<v Speaker 1>you recognize that you have this unusual</v>
<v Speaker 1>position in the culture where you can </v>

2703
02:20:04.851 --> 02:20:09.050
<v Speaker 1>uniquely influence certain things </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of this?</v>

2704
02:20:09.980 --> 02:20:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean you essentially have a gift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2705
02:20:12.210 --> 02:20:17.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean you would think it was a curse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure it's been fueled by many,</v>

2706
02:20:18.001 --> 02:20:20.280
<v Speaker 1>many years of discipline and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and learning,</v>

2707
02:20:20.700 --> 02:20:24.030
<v Speaker 1>but you essentially have a gift and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this</v>

2708
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:30.530
<v Speaker 1>radical sort of creativity engine when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to innovation and technology.</v>

2709
02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:35.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going at a very high rpm all the </v>

2710
02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:37.920
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that last and stuff?</v>

2711
02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:42.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what would've happened if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got into a sensory deprivation tank.</v>

2712
02:20:42.350 --> 02:20:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Let's try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds concerning like running the </v>

2713
02:20:47.391 --> 02:20:50.650
<v Speaker 1>engine with no resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>

2714
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not.</v>

2715
02:20:53.290 --> 02:20:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I'll try it.</v>

2716
02:20:56.600 --> 02:21:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever experimented with </v>

2717
02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:03.270
<v Speaker 1>meditation or anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2718
02:21:03.530 --> 02:21:05.480
<v Speaker 1>What do you do or what have you done </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather?</v>

2719
02:21:08.780 --> 02:21:13.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean you just sort of sit there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>required and then repeat some mantra </v>

2720
02:21:15.570 --> 02:21:19.890
<v Speaker 1>which acts as a focal point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still the mind.</v>

2721
02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:25.120
<v Speaker 1>It just stolen mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't find myself drawn to it </v>

2722
02:21:25.291 --> 02:21:30.291
<v Speaker 1>frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that perhaps productivity </v>

2723
02:21:31.770 --> 02:21:36.770
<v Speaker 1>is maybe more attractive to you then </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment and or even the concept of</v>

2724
02:21:38.551 --> 02:21:40.650
<v Speaker 1>whatever enlightenment means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you trying to achieve when</v>

2725
02:21:40.651 --> 02:21:43.130
<v Speaker 1>you're meditating all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you.</v>

2726
02:21:43.140 --> 02:21:48.140
<v Speaker 1>It seems like almost like there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>frantic ness to your creativity that </v>

2727
02:21:48.140 --> 02:21:50.430
<v Speaker 1>comes out of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this burning furnace,</v>

2728
02:21:50.970 --> 02:21:53.490
<v Speaker 1>and in order for you to like calm that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing down,</v>

2729
02:21:53.970 --> 02:21:56.940
<v Speaker 1>he got thrown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might have to throw it too much water on</v>

2730
02:21:56.941 --> 02:21:57.090
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2731
02:21:59.180 --> 02:22:04.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like a never ending explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it like I try and explain </v>

2732
02:22:05.591 --> 02:22:10.591
<v Speaker 1>it to a dumb person like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on at her and never under </v>

2733
02:22:11.201 --> 02:22:13.510
<v Speaker 1>any explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just constant ideas.</v>

2734
02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Just bouncing around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2735
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Ooh Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2736
02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:22.570
<v Speaker 1>so when everybody leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just Elan sitting at home,</v>

2737
02:22:22.571 --> 02:22:27.571
<v Speaker 1>brushing his teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just of ideas bouncing around your head </v>

2738
02:22:27.571 --> 02:22:32.010
<v Speaker 1>the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you realize that that's not the</v>

2739
02:22:32.011 --> 02:22:37.011
<v Speaker 1>case with most people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when I was,</v>

2740
02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:41.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five or six or something,</v>

2741
02:22:41.370 --> 02:22:45.240
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think you're insane?</v>

2742
02:22:45.900 --> 02:22:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Because it was clear that other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>did not.</v>

2743
02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:54.190
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their mind wasn't exploding with ideas </v>

2744
02:22:54.190 --> 02:22:54.190
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were an expressing it.</v>

2745
02:22:54.190 --> 02:22:58.760
<v Speaker 1>They weren't talking about it all day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you realize by the time you were </v>

2746
02:22:58.760 --> 02:22:58.760
<v Speaker 1>five or six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2747
02:22:58.760 --> 02:23:01.910
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're probably not even getting this </v>

2748
02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:02.730
<v Speaker 1>thing that I'm getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2749
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:06.560
<v Speaker 1>it was just strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2750
02:23:08.090 --> 02:23:09.680
<v Speaker 5>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's strange.</v>

2751
02:23:11.330 --> 02:23:12.830
<v Speaker 1>That was my conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked range,</v>

2752
02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:17.360
<v Speaker 1>but did you feel diminished by it in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>

2753
02:23:17.570 --> 02:23:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Like knowing that this is a weird thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you really probably couldn't </v>

2754
02:23:22.570 --> 02:23:25.960
<v Speaker 1>commiserate with with other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't understand that you hope </v>

2755
02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:27.860
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't find out because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>might put me away with something.</v>

2756
02:23:27.890 --> 02:23:29.750
<v Speaker 1>You thought that for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2757
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:32.350
<v Speaker 1>When you were little and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are wearing.</v>

2758
02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Or what if they put money away?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you were little,</v>

2759
02:23:34.371 --> 02:23:36.160
<v Speaker 1>you thought this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2760
02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Like you thought this is so radically </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than the people that are </v>

2761
02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:43.160
<v Speaker 1>around me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they find out I got the stream coming</v>

2762
02:23:43.161 --> 02:23:44.750
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2763
02:23:45.140 --> 02:23:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2764
02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:50.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was only like five or six really.</v>

2765
02:23:51.250 --> 02:23:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think this is like.</v>

2766
02:23:53.391 --> 02:23:57.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's outliers biologically.</v>

2767
02:23:58.810 --> 02:24:01.310
<v Speaker 1>You mean there's people that are seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot nine.</v>

2768
02:24:01.311 --> 02:24:06.311
<v Speaker 1>There's people that have giant hands is </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have eyes that are 20 slash </v>

2769
02:24:06.311 --> 02:24:07.370
<v Speaker 1>15 vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always outliers.</v>

2770
02:24:08.510 --> 02:24:09.090
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2771
02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:13.620
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like you're caught this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have got some,</v>

2772
02:24:14.270 --> 02:24:19.270
<v Speaker 1>you're like on some weird innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity sort of wave.</v>

2773
02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:25.960
<v Speaker 1>That's very unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you tapped into.</v>

2774
02:24:26.890 --> 02:24:27.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think of the,</v>

2775
02:24:27.690 --> 02:24:32.690
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the various things you've been able to </v>

2776
02:24:32.690 --> 02:24:33.100
<v Speaker 1>accomplish in a very short amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and you're constantly doing this.</v>

2777
02:24:33.490 --> 02:24:35.620
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're weird person,</v>

2778
02:24:35.740 --> 02:24:36.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2779
02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what if there's a million Elon </v>

2780
02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Musk's?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that would be very weird.</v>

2781
02:24:48.250 --> 02:24:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2782
02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:50.370
<v Speaker 1>that'd be pretty weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2783
02:24:50.371 --> 02:24:52.210
<v Speaker 1>are real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

2784
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if they're a million show rockets?</v>

2785
02:24:57.790 --> 02:25:02.790
<v Speaker 1>The probably is probably too many and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>

2786
02:25:05.471 --> 02:25:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the case with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>

2787
02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2788
02:25:11.170 --> 02:25:12.000
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2789
02:25:12.090 --> 02:25:14.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my goal is like try to useful things,</v>

2790
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:18.600
<v Speaker 1>try to maximize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably the is good.</v>

2791
02:25:19.270 --> 02:25:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the future exciting when you look </v>

2792
02:25:24.270 --> 02:25:24.270
<v Speaker 1>forward to,</v>

2793
02:25:24.490 --> 02:25:27.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know with,</v>

2794
02:25:27.210 --> 02:25:29.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2795
02:25:29.850 --> 02:25:33.000
<v Speaker 2>with Tesla or like try and make things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people love you.</v>

2796
02:25:33.010 --> 02:25:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like kit.</v>

2797
02:25:34.990 --> 02:25:39.990
<v Speaker 2>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many things can you buy that you </v>

2798
02:25:39.990 --> 02:25:40.210
<v Speaker 2>really love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really give you joy?</v>

2799
02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:42.550
<v Speaker 2>So rare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so rare.</v>

2800
02:25:42.610 --> 02:25:47.610
<v Speaker 2>I wish there were more things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're trying to make things </v>

2801
02:25:47.610 --> 02:25:47.920
<v Speaker 2>that somebody loves.</v>

2802
02:25:48.700 --> 02:25:53.700
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think about making someone </v>

2803
02:25:53.700 --> 02:25:53.700
<v Speaker 1>loves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2804
02:25:53.700 --> 02:25:57.240
<v Speaker 1>do you specifically think about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what things would improve people's </v>

2805
02:25:57.240 --> 02:25:58.000
<v Speaker 1>experience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

2806
02:25:58.001 --> 02:26:02.980
<v Speaker 1>what would change the way people </v>
<v Speaker 1>interface with life that would make them</v>

2807
02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:08.640
<v Speaker 1>more relaxed or more happy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really think like when you thinking </v>

2808
02:26:09.921 --> 02:26:12.170
<v Speaker 1>about things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that one of your considerations?</v>

2809
02:26:12.171 --> 02:26:17.171
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can I do that would help people </v>

2810
02:26:17.171 --> 02:26:17.171
<v Speaker 1>that maybe they wouldn't be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure it out?</v>

2811
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:18.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>

2812
02:26:19.380 --> 02:26:23.310
<v Speaker 2>like what are the set of things that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>be done to make the future better?</v>

2813
02:26:23.820 --> 02:26:26.220
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2814
02:26:26.221 --> 02:26:31.221
<v Speaker 2>so I think the future where we are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>space fairing civilization and out there</v>

2815
02:26:31.561 --> 02:26:34.800
<v Speaker 2>among the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is very exciting.</v>

2816
02:26:35.190 --> 02:26:39.510
<v Speaker 2>This makes me look forward to a future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This makes me want that future.</v>

2817
02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:43.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that need to be,</v>

2818
02:26:43.171 --> 02:26:47.160
<v Speaker 2>things that make you look forward to </v>
<v Speaker 2>waking up in the morning,</v>

2819
02:26:47.161 --> 02:26:52.161
<v Speaker 2>you wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look forward to the day before to </v>

2820
02:26:52.161 --> 02:26:54.801
<v Speaker 2>the future and a future where we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>spacefaring civilization and out there </v>

2821
02:26:55.221 --> 02:26:57.020
<v Speaker 2>among the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's very exciting.</v>

2822
02:26:57.410 --> 02:27:01.520
<v Speaker 2>That is a thing we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if,</v>

2823
02:27:02.090 --> 02:27:04.400
<v Speaker 2>if you knew we would not be a space </v>
<v Speaker 2>frank civilization,</v>

2824
02:27:04.401 --> 02:27:07.070
<v Speaker 2>but forever confined to Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this would not be a good future.</v>

2825
02:27:07.071 --> 02:27:08.840
<v Speaker 2>That would be very sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

2826
02:27:09.610 --> 02:27:14.190
<v Speaker 1>it would be the future of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the just the finite lifespan,</v>

2827
02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:18.800
<v Speaker 1>the earth itself and the solar system </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself that even though it's possibly,</v>

2828
02:27:19.010 --> 02:27:19.890
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

2829
02:27:20.250 --> 02:27:24.150
<v Speaker 1>how long do they feel like the sun and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the solar system is going to exist?</v>

2830
02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:25.920
<v Speaker 1>How many hundreds of millions of years.</v>

2831
02:27:27.650 --> 02:27:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably,</v>

2832
02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:32.570
<v Speaker 2>if you're saying the windows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sun boil the ocean,</v>

2833
02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:32.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2834
02:27:35.330 --> 02:27:38.190
<v Speaker 1>For about 500 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is,</v>

2835
02:27:38.250 --> 02:27:43.080
<v Speaker 1>is it sad that we never leave because in</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 million years that happens?</v>

2836
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're saying?</v>

2837
02:27:45.940 --> 02:27:50.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think like if there are two </v>

2838
02:27:50.940 --> 02:27:53.281
<v Speaker 2>futures and one futurists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're out there among the stars and the </v>

2839
02:27:53.281 --> 02:27:54.340
<v Speaker 2>things we read about and see in science </v>
<v Speaker 2>fiction movies,</v>

2840
02:27:54.580 --> 02:27:58.550
<v Speaker 2>the good ones are true and we have these</v>
<v Speaker 2>starships and we're,</v>

2841
02:28:00.220 --> 02:28:05.220
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to see what other planets </v>

2842
02:28:05.220 --> 02:28:07.471
<v Speaker 2>are like and where a multitenant species</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the scope and scale of consciousness</v>

2843
02:28:07.971 --> 02:28:12.971
<v Speaker 2>is expanded across many civilizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And many planets and many star systems.</v>

2844
02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:19.320
<v Speaker 2>This is a great future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a wonderful thing to me and </v>

2845
02:28:20.650 --> 02:28:22.340
<v Speaker 2>that's what we should strive for.</v>

2846
02:28:25.050 --> 02:28:30.050
<v Speaker 1>But that's biological travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cells traveling physically to </v>

2847
02:28:30.050 --> 02:28:32.180
<v Speaker 1>another location.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2848
02:28:34.570 --> 02:28:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's definitely where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going?</v>

2849
02:28:36.700 --> 02:28:37.800
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2850
02:28:37.900 --> 02:28:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to think so and now I'm thinking </v>

2851
02:28:42.900 --> 02:28:46.471
<v Speaker 1>more likely less than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like almost every day.</v>

2852
02:28:46.540 --> 02:28:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Less likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can definitely go to the moon and </v>

2853
02:28:51.540 --> 02:28:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2854
02:28:51.540 --> 02:28:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Everything will go to the asteroid belt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can go to the moons of Jupiter.</v>

2855
02:28:55.110 --> 02:28:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Saturn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can even get to Pluto.</v>

2856
02:28:57.160 --> 02:29:00.040
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the craziest place ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we colonize Mars and retire,</v>

2857
02:29:00.041 --> 02:29:02.680
<v Speaker 1>formed it and turned it into like a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamaica.</v>

2858
02:29:05.380 --> 02:29:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Just imagine they're going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

2859
02:29:10.700 --> 02:29:12.360
<v Speaker 1>There's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2860
02:29:12.490 --> 02:29:15.830
<v Speaker 1>We turned the whole thing into Cancun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2861
02:29:15.940 --> 02:29:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean over time it wouldn't be easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yes.</v>

2862
02:29:18.160 --> 02:29:19.870
<v Speaker 1>If you could just want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could warm it up.</v>

2863
02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look it up.</v>

2864
02:29:21.161 --> 02:29:23.470
<v Speaker 1>You could add air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get some water there.</v>

2865
02:29:23.620 --> 02:29:28.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of years or </v>

2866
02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:28.620
<v Speaker 1>whatever it takes.</v>

2867
02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:30.640
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be a multiplanetary vcs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be amazing species.</v>

2868
02:29:30.650 --> 02:29:34.030
<v Speaker 1>That's to be like air conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sad.</v>

2869
02:29:34.031 --> 02:29:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm pro human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>

2870
02:29:36.790 --> 02:29:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>

2871
02:29:37.810 --> 02:29:39.460
<v Speaker 1>I love humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's great.</v>

2872
02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:44.640
<v Speaker 1>We're glad as a robot that you love </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans because we love you too.</v>

2873
02:29:44.951 --> 02:29:46.690
<v Speaker 1>And we don't want you to kill us and eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

2874
02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:49.420
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean strangely,</v>

2875
02:29:49.421 --> 02:29:51.880
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people don't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity and see it as a blight,</v>

2876
02:29:51.910 --> 02:29:54.190
<v Speaker 1>but I do not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think one of those,</v>

2877
02:29:54.490 --> 02:29:56.410
<v Speaker 1>I think part of that it's just they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

2878
02:29:56.680 --> 02:29:58.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been struggling.</v>

2879
02:29:58.300 --> 02:30:00.580
<v Speaker 1>When people struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they associate their struggle with other</v>

2880
02:30:00.581 --> 02:30:04.000
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never internalize their problems.</v>

2881
02:30:04.001 --> 02:30:09.001
<v Speaker 1>They looked to other people is holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>them back and people suck and fuck </v>

2882
02:30:09.001 --> 02:30:09.001
<v Speaker 1>people and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2883
02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:10.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a neverland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never ending cycle,</v>

2884
02:30:14.420 --> 02:30:16.520
<v Speaker 1>but not always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2885
02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:20.630
<v Speaker 1>most people are really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>

2886
02:30:20.750 --> 02:30:23.240
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This may sound Corny,</v>

2887
02:30:23.450 --> 02:30:26.870
<v Speaker 1>it does sound Corny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but love is the answer is the answer.</v>

2888
02:30:27.070 --> 02:30:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2889
02:30:28.940 --> 02:30:33.940
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds quite because we're all </v>

2890
02:30:33.940 --> 02:30:33.940
<v Speaker 1>scared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2891
02:30:33.940 --> 02:30:37.151
<v Speaker 1>we're all scared of trying to love </v>
<v Speaker 1>people being rejected or someone take </v>

2892
02:30:37.331 --> 02:30:39.980
<v Speaker 1>advantage of you because you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be loving.</v>

2893
02:30:40.110 --> 02:30:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we all could just relax and love </v>

2894
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.110
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

2895
02:30:46.600 --> 02:30:47.980
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't hurt to have more love in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2896
02:30:48.940 --> 02:30:50.360
<v Speaker 1>It definitely wouldn't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2897
02:30:50.410 --> 02:30:51.440
<v Speaker 1>it'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2898
02:30:51.550 --> 02:30:52.900
<v Speaker 1>we should do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2899
02:30:53.260 --> 02:30:55.810
<v Speaker 1>I agreement really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you fix that?</v>

2900
02:30:55.811 --> 02:30:59.310
<v Speaker 1>You have a love machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2901
02:30:59.440 --> 02:31:04.440
<v Speaker 1>but to probably spend more time with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends and less time on social </v>

2902
02:31:04.961 --> 02:31:08.860
<v Speaker 1>media now deleting social media from </v>
<v Speaker 1>your applications,</v>

2903
02:31:08.861 --> 02:31:13.861
<v Speaker 1>from your phones and other that give you</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 10 percent boost to happiness was the </v>

2904
02:31:14.620 --> 02:31:15.310
<v Speaker 1>percentages.</v>

2905
02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:20.640
<v Speaker 3>I think probably something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2906
02:31:20.660 --> 02:31:23.320
<v Speaker 3>It's about a good 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2907
02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:25.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2908
02:31:25.861 --> 02:31:30.861
<v Speaker 3>the only thing I've kept as twitter </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I kind of like need some means </v>

2909
02:31:30.861 --> 02:31:31.390
<v Speaker 3>of getting a message out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2910
02:31:31.620 --> 02:31:32.680
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2911
02:31:33.900 --> 02:31:38.190
<v Speaker 3>well that's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So far so good.</v>

2912
02:31:38.790 --> 02:31:40.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting with you,</v>

2913
02:31:40.171 --> 02:31:45.171
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he actually occasionally engage with </v>

2914
02:31:45.171 --> 02:31:45.630
<v Speaker 3>people on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2915
02:31:45.720 --> 02:31:48.240
<v Speaker 3>It's what percentage of that is a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea?</v>

2916
02:31:48.820 --> 02:31:53.820
<v Speaker 3>Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good to question 10 percent.</v>

2917
02:32:00.510 --> 02:32:02.970
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's unbalanced.</v>

2918
02:32:02.971 --> 02:32:05.760
<v Speaker 3>More good than bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's definitely some bad.</v>

2919
02:32:06.810 --> 02:32:10.170
<v Speaker 3>So do you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully the good outweighs the bad.</v>

2920
02:32:10.980 --> 02:32:15.980
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever think about how odd it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that weird feeling that you get when </v>

2921
02:32:15.980 --> 02:32:16.710
<v Speaker 3>someone says something Shitty to you on </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter and you read it,</v>

2922
02:32:17.010 --> 02:32:20.430
<v Speaker 3>that weird feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this weird little negative Joel.</v>

2923
02:32:20.940 --> 02:32:24.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like a subjective negative jolt of </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy they don't really need to absorb,</v>

2924
02:32:24.751 --> 02:32:25.650
<v Speaker 3>but you do anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2925
02:32:25.651 --> 02:32:30.651
<v Speaker 3>well fuck the score for Kim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of negativity on </v>

2926
02:32:31.381 --> 02:32:32.250
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

2927
02:32:32.251 --> 02:32:37.251
<v Speaker 3>but it's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in its form like the way if you </v>

2928
02:32:37.251 --> 02:32:40.701
<v Speaker 3>ingest it as if you're like you try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be like a little scientist as you're </v>

2929
02:32:40.701 --> 02:32:41.040
<v Speaker 3>ingesting it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2930
02:32:41.041 --> 02:32:42.210
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where does this?</v>

2931
02:32:42.470 --> 02:32:47.470
<v Speaker 3>And I'm even getting upset at some </v>
<v Speaker 3>strange person saying something mean to </v>

2932
02:32:47.470 --> 02:32:49.320
<v Speaker 3>me it's not even accurate.</v>

2933
02:32:51.330 --> 02:32:54.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean the vast number of negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>comments,</v>

2934
02:32:54.660 --> 02:32:58.290
<v Speaker 3>a syllabus for the vast majority who I </v>
<v Speaker 3>just ignore them.</v>

2935
02:32:58.380 --> 02:32:59.730
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2936
02:33:00.380 --> 02:33:03.180
<v Speaker 3>Every now and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get drawn in somewhat good.</v>

2937
02:33:03.650 --> 02:33:05.340
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make mistakes.</v>

2938
02:33:05.610 --> 02:33:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could make mistakes.</v>

2939
02:33:07.090 --> 02:33:09.390
<v Speaker 3>We make some mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all human.</v>

2940
02:33:09.630 --> 02:33:11.340
<v Speaker 3>We can make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2941
02:33:12.420 --> 02:33:15.630
<v Speaker 3>it's hard and people love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you say something and you'd take it</v>

2942
02:33:15.631 --> 02:33:16.710
<v Speaker 3>back and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

2943
02:33:16.711 --> 02:33:20.850
<v Speaker 3>We saved it forever.</v>

2944
02:33:20.851 --> 02:33:24.300
<v Speaker 3>You had that thought you had that </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought like,</v>

2945
02:33:24.301 --> 02:33:25.530
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I deleted it.</v>

2946
02:33:25.650 --> 02:33:29.010
<v Speaker 3>Not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who had the thought?</v>

2947
02:33:29.100 --> 02:33:34.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm better than you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had that thought you had that </v>

2948
02:33:34.100 --> 02:33:34.100
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You piece of shit.</v>

2949
02:33:34.100 --> 02:33:34.100
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saved it.</v>

2950
02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:36.460
<v Speaker 3>I put it on my blog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2951
02:33:36.780 --> 02:33:41.780
<v Speaker 3>sure why people think that that anyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>would think that deleting a tweet that </v>

2952
02:33:41.780 --> 02:33:43.500
<v Speaker 3>makes them go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

2953
02:33:43.501 --> 02:33:43.920
<v Speaker 3>hello.</v>

2954
02:33:43.970 --> 02:33:45.730
<v Speaker 3>Then the Internet for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2955
02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:51.280
<v Speaker 3>but it's even like anything is they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't forever you to be able to delete </v>

2956
02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:54.801
<v Speaker 3>it because the problem is if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>delete it and you don't believe it </v>

2957
02:33:54.801 --> 02:33:55.560
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really hard to say,</v>

2958

<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing above,</v>

2959
02:33:56.940 --> 02:34:00.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't really believe that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I changed the way I view things.</v>

2960
02:34:00.350 --> 02:34:01.260
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people go,</v>

2961
02:34:01.270 --> 02:34:03.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you already have that over there.</v>

2962
02:34:03.151 --> 02:34:08.151
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to just take that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to pay attention to that </v>

2963
02:34:08.151 --> 02:34:08.151
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wrote her.</v>

2964
02:34:08.151 --> 02:34:11.160
<v Speaker 3>It's on your permanent record forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tattoo on your permanent record.</v>

2965
02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a tattoo.</v>

2966
02:34:13.530 --> 02:34:14.580
<v Speaker 3>You keep it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2967
02:34:14.850 --> 02:34:15.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2968
02:34:15.991 --> 02:34:17.560
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this thing where there's,</v>

2969
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:17.990
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

2970
02:34:18.250 --> 02:34:20.230
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lack of compassion,</v>

2971
02:34:20.231 --> 02:34:24.220
<v Speaker 1>so lack of compassion issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just like intentionally shitty to</v>

2972
02:34:24.221 --> 02:34:27.010
<v Speaker 1>each other all the time online and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to catch me.</v>

2973
02:34:27.260 --> 02:34:32.260
<v Speaker 1>It's more trying to catch people doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's arrestable like a cop </v>

2974
02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:33.860
<v Speaker 1>trying to like get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2975
02:34:34.070 --> 02:34:39.070
<v Speaker 1>arrests on as his record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're trying to catch you </v>

2976
02:34:39.070 --> 02:34:41.650
<v Speaker 1>with something more than.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're logically looking at it thinking</v>

2977
02:34:41.651 --> 02:34:45.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad thing that you've done or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea they don't agree with so much.</v>

2978
02:34:45.341 --> 02:34:46.300
<v Speaker 1>They need to insult you.</v>

2979
02:34:46.820 --> 02:34:48.720
<v Speaker 2>Trying to catch you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2980
02:34:49.250 --> 02:34:54.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's way easier to be mean on </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media than it is to be mean in </v>

2981
02:34:54.250 --> 02:34:54.690
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2982
02:34:54.860 --> 02:34:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Way Easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2983
02:34:56.350 --> 02:34:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

2984
02:34:58.170 --> 02:35:03.170
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a normal way of humans </v>

2985
02:35:03.170 --> 02:35:03.170
<v Speaker 1>interacting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cheating.</v>

2986
02:35:03.170 --> 02:35:04.240
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact so easily,</v>

2987
02:35:04.510 --> 02:35:06.660
<v Speaker 1>but people were not looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2988
02:35:06.940 --> 02:35:11.940
<v Speaker 1>You would never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd never be so mean to somebody </v>

2989
02:35:11.940 --> 02:35:11.940
<v Speaker 1>looking in their eyes and if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd feel like shit.</v>

2990
02:35:11.940 --> 02:35:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Most people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2991
02:35:12.701 --> 02:35:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're a sociopath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd feel terrible.</v>

2992
02:35:15.970 --> 02:35:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elon Musk.</v>

2993
02:35:20.610 --> 02:35:22.000
<v Speaker 1>This has been a pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2994

02:35:53.861 --> 02:35:58.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people should be nicer to each </v>

3008
02:35:58.861 --> 02:36:00.630
<v Speaker 2>other and give people and give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give more credit to,</v>

3009
02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:05.640
<v Speaker 2>to others and don't assume that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean until you know they're actually </v>

3010
02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:08.740
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3011
02:36:08.980 --> 02:36:11.830

<v Speaker 2>usually wrong about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People a nicer than you think.</v>
