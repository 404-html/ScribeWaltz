00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.610
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I try not to complain about just because it's part of that is part of the job.</v>

3
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.780
<v Speaker 1>And I'd rather do it then work construction any day.</v>

4
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.440
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes mentally is tough to do a morning interview.</v>

5
00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:13.274
<v Speaker 1>But if I have,</v>

6
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.050
<v Speaker 1>if I have,</v>

7
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:14.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.940
<v Speaker 1>take Adderall before dinner,</v>

9
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.001
<v Speaker 1>I'm snappy,</v>

10
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:17.691
<v Speaker 1>I got jumped,</v>

11
00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:19.370
<v Speaker 1>I got anecdotes and then I can kind of,</v>

12
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>I know sometimes now I've learned how to,</v>

13
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.640
<v Speaker 1>you got to take an interview over sometimes or they want to not go on a rant but</v>

14
00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:27.380
<v Speaker 1>you have to not let them,</v>

15
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.040
<v Speaker 1>just cause they can get into that cutting off your jokes and eh,</v>

17
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.020
<v Speaker 1>funny man handlebars just cut you off.</v>

18
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>So just learning how to,</v>

19
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.110
<v Speaker 1>how to do that and just having the energy and focus to be able to is it's real</v>

20
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:39.944
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>

21
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 2>The morning radio thing,</v>

23
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 2>if like they're good,</v>

24
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.770
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>

25
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.530
<v Speaker 1>It's real fun.</v>

26
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>It's really fun.</v>

27
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Pro is supported and set you up.</v>

28
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>And then sometimes they just say,</v>

29
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>so what's funny in the world right now</v>

30
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>in an interview the other day,</v>

31
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>the guy asked me that exact question,</v>

32
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>what's making you laugh right now?</v>

33
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

34
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>to Hannah,</v>

35
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>but what are you talking about on stage?</v>

36
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

37
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>that's another one they do.</v>

38
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Somebody asked me that before.</v>

40
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:10.830
<v Speaker 1>A show I was doing in New York.</v>

41
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to talk about?</v>

42
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.821
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

43
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 1>just came over like,</v>

44
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>so what are we talking about today?</v>

45
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Like you now,</v>

46
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.713
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

47
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.150
<v Speaker 2>dudes that would go,</v>

48
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.043
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

49
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.070
<v Speaker 2>here's my new piece.</v>

50
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.100
<v Speaker 2>It's all about how man is constricted by a first his mom and then his wife and a</v>

51
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:30.560
<v Speaker 2>then ultimately his lawyer.</v>

52
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

55
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I guess the thing is just,</v>

56
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I try to remember that people aren't coming from a shitty place normally.</v>

57
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>They just don't know how to communicate to me in a way that won't make me feel</v>

58
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>cynical and hate them.</v>

59
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.951
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

60
00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:47.060
<v Speaker 1>So I gotta keep that in mind,</v>

61
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.700
<v Speaker 1>but in the moment it's like what the fuck it,</v>

62
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.960
<v Speaker 1>you just ask me what's funny in a world right now</v>

63
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.790
<v Speaker 2>for someone who's not a comic,</v>

64
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:54.860
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't understand how awkward that would be.</v>

65
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Like when you like when you can go on a radio show and they just let you talk.</v>

66
00:01:59.121 --> 00:01:59.954
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

67
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.381
<v Speaker 2>Hang out,</v>

68
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:01.160
<v Speaker 2>let's just hang out,</v>

69
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.551
<v Speaker 2>hang out,</v>

70
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:04.040
<v Speaker 2>talk about stuff back and forth from each other.</v>

71
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

72
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

73
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.961
<v Speaker 2>It's not a lot of them.</v>

74
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:06.860
<v Speaker 2>They can do that though.</v>

75
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.873
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

76
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever do those radio tours?</v>

77
00:02:10.251 --> 00:02:14.210
<v Speaker 2>We have to call like 10 different people and then you realize like eight of them</v>

78
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:15.200
<v Speaker 2>have the same voice,</v>

79
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.090
<v Speaker 2>like almost exactly.</v>

80
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.611
<v Speaker 1>What does this,</v>

81
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:18.560
<v Speaker 1>the radio voice,</v>

82
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.581
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>

83
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:20.600
<v Speaker 1>when it was tested,</v>

84
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.940
<v Speaker 1>when it was,</v>

85
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:22.210
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

86
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

87
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>it was a study that people,</v>

88
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:25.190
<v Speaker 1>that people like to listen to.</v>

89
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:25.911
<v Speaker 1>This right here,</v>

90
00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:27.320
<v Speaker 1>we live here in Nashville.</v>

91
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:30.410
<v Speaker 1>We got Hannibal bears in the studio when alive here in Cincinnati.</v>

92
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:31.244
<v Speaker 1>We got had,</v>

93
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>it's a couple versions of that.</v>

94
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:34.610
<v Speaker 1>This is a couple of versions of that wisdom,</v>

95
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

96
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.370
<v Speaker 1>And it was the sports guy as well.</v>

97
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Gus Johnson here for showtime.</v>

98
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.440
<v Speaker 1>There's the news guy.</v>

99
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.450
<v Speaker 1>It's just the same as um,</v>

100
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.470
<v Speaker 1>rappers though too.</v>

101
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>They rappers rap voice.</v>

102
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.000
<v Speaker 1>You'd talk to rapidly.</v>

103
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.100
<v Speaker 1>My sound like me,</v>

104
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.850
<v Speaker 1>but then when in there wrapped it like,</v>

105
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is?</v>

106
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a persona.</v>

107
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.900
<v Speaker 1>It's just a persona that you know,</v>

108
00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:58.280
<v Speaker 1>works for that situation.</v>

109
00:02:58.281 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 1>I like it though.</v>

110
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.711
<v Speaker 1>I like the,</v>

111
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>the Gus Johnson</v>

112
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.181
<v Speaker 2>type voice,</v>

113
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:01.841
<v Speaker 2>like of a guys.</v>

114
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

115
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 2>like when I say that about Gus Johnson,</v>

116
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:04.541
<v Speaker 2>I'm not putting them down.</v>

117
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:04.691
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

118
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 2>I liked that professional.</v>

119
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Here we are Madison Square Garden.</v>

120
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:10.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't want a guy who's like,</v>

121
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.433
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

122
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm like me.</v>

123
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

124
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 2>when I do the UFC,</v>

125
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why I'm the color guy and I'm not the play by play guy.</v>

126
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't do the big,</v>

127
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 2>here we are Joe FC one 52.</v>

128
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Like those guys are important.</v>

129
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.183
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

130
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is as tree,</v>

131
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 2>its pageantry isn't a reason why Michael buffer works well.</v>

132
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:29.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

133
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 2>That's even more so because he's a announcer.</v>

134
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Let's get ready to rumble.</v>

135
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:35.970
<v Speaker 2>This pageantry dog.</v>

136
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.800
<v Speaker 2>It's pageants.</v>

137
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

138
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

139
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not putting it down,</v>

140
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.110
<v Speaker 2>but it is weird radios when radio he'll cause you don't have to talk like radio</v>

141
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 2>is different cause it's supposed to be your personality.</v>

142
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

143
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.870
<v Speaker 2>Like sports doesn't spoil as a guide.</v>

144
00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 2>The news is the news,</v>

145
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 2>but radios was to be your vibe.</v>

146
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 2>But then you sound like the dude in Saint Louis also.</v>

147
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 2>You sound like the dude who was all over the place.</v>

148
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Every guy you know another place where that exists was that Strip club Djs?</v>

149
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.003
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

150
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

151
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to analyze this for many years and I think with Strip club Djs,</v>

152
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 2>it's like no one wants to hear a dude talking while girls are dancing naked.</v>

153
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 2>You do not want to hear that guy.</v>

154
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 2>So he's got to make it like a song.</v>

155
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.920
<v Speaker 2>Like all right,</v>

156
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 2>come in to this stage.</v>

157
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 2>It's amber.</v>

158
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Remember everybody $40 comic cons.</v>

159
00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:25.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's an entertainment aspect to the what he's doing.</v>

160
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's almost like he's singing a song.</v>

161
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 2>But have you been to a black strip club in Atlanta though?</v>

162
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.070
<v Speaker 2>No stitches.</v>

163
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

164
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Those djs out of most amazing Dj's.</v>

165
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Vocally f really because they drive the tipping.</v>

166
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.740
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

167
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.360
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

168
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.760
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

169
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.840
<v Speaker 1>They crack jokes.</v>

170
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.630
<v Speaker 1>I asked when I was,</v>

171
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.500
<v Speaker 1>it's just so funny.</v>

172
00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:45.751
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

173
00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:45.991
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

174
00:04:45.991 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 1>you need to pay the pussy like they here.</v>

175
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Y'all ain't spending money.</v>

176
00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:51.240
<v Speaker 1>They'll drop the track.</v>

177
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.980
<v Speaker 1>They come cut the track by God.</v>

178
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Spend some mother fucking money.</v>

179
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Look what she's doing up there.</v>

180
00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:56.474
<v Speaker 1>She's up there.</v>

181
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.730
<v Speaker 1>The Atlanta Dj's and Strip club.</v>

182
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.751
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

183
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:01.650
<v Speaker 1>They to Atlanta,</v>

184
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 1>probably just other black.</v>

185
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:09.541
<v Speaker 1>That black strip clubs like the DJ drives that Shit and is the driving force and</v>

186
00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:12.740
<v Speaker 1>as an entertainer in addition to add,</v>

187
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.583
<v Speaker 1>he adds to it.</v>

188
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.140
<v Speaker 2>See now I'm weighing the potential dangers of going to a black strip club in</v>

189
00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Atlanta with the entertainment aspect of how amazing.</v>

190
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:23.940
<v Speaker 2>It must be dangerous man.</v>

191
00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that a guy like me?</v>

192
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.923
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

193
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I need to go.</v>

194
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 1>If I go with you,</v>

195
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.141
<v Speaker 1>I'll go with you.</v>

196
00:05:34.141 --> 00:05:35.070
<v Speaker 1>I could slide right in.</v>

197
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even that blood.</v>

198
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:41.691
<v Speaker 1>Then I play but not black in a black strip club.</v>

199
00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:43.320
<v Speaker 1>The djs,</v>

200
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.070
<v Speaker 1>the right famous ones is fate.</v>

201
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the names though cause I have a bit,</v>

202
00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:49.350
<v Speaker 1>but you go to somewhere uh,</v>

203
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.780
<v Speaker 1>magic city or magic city.</v>

204
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.520
<v Speaker 1>A few other ones in Atlanta.</v>

205
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

206
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>the Dj is is,</v>

207
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 1>is important and makes the Strip was more money and a strep was probably end up</v>

208
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.110
<v Speaker 1>tipping out the DJ.</v>

209
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

210
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

211
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 2>They have like an arrangement,</v>

212
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:04.431
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

213
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

214
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 2>My friend Eddie used to work at a strip club.</v>

215
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.710
<v Speaker 2>I used to go and visit him at work watching who's a DJ.</v>

216
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.841
<v Speaker 2>So I got to,</v>

217
00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 2>I got to see the craft.</v>

218
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.550
<v Speaker 2>I got to see how everybody does it.</v>

219
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting the relationship they all have,</v>

220
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.160
<v Speaker 2>it becomes just like,</v>

221
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean you might as well be working in a restaurant.</v>

222
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Everybody develops the same sort of blue lights man.</v>

223
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.513
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

224
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.110
<v Speaker 2>People get naked and that's,</v>

225
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 2>it's weird cause it's porn.</v>

226
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Porn is like that too.</v>

227
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Like those people get used to each other and it becomes just like any other</v>

228
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.463
<v Speaker 2>normal,</v>

229
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.971
<v Speaker 1>see you later.</v>

230
00:06:30.971 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

231
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Jason on I'm</v>

232
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.553
<v Speaker 1>season.</v>

233
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably funny when it's just somebody you fucked like two years</v>

234
00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:39.760
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

235
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh good to see you again.</v>

236
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:43.080
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

237
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.230
<v Speaker 2>I think they have definitely a more relaxed attitude about it.</v>

238
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

239
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:47.311
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

240
00:06:47.311 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 2>if you run into somebody that used to fuck out of nowhere,</v>

241
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.303
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

242
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:51.483
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

243
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.180
<v Speaker 2>this is me getting me.</v>

244
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I'll see you naked naked.</v>

245
00:06:56.011 --> 00:06:56.400
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

246
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.233
<v Speaker 2>You take care of.</v>

247
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Don't mind that Mo.</v>

248
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.280
<v Speaker 2>It's weird when you haven't seen someone at 20 years and then you get to see</v>

249
00:07:02.281 --> 00:07:02.461
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

250

252
00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:04.831

00:07:18.541 --> 00:07:20.100
<v Speaker 2>She was like sex sessions with people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>A lot of them to do like corporate gigs.</v>

275
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Corporates in quotes.</v>

276
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.873
<v Speaker 1>The quotes,</v>

277
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:35.981
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

278
00:07:35.981 --> 00:07:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Sort of.</v>

279
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:37.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

280

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

283
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.290

288
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.580
