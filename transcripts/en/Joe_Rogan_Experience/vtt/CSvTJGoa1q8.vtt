1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about this rematch.</v>

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:05.663
<v Speaker 1>Which one?</v>

4
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz and Conor Mcgregor.</v>

5
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>What are they fighting at 55 I do not know.</v>

6
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's been solidified.</v>

7
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I believe that Connor is asked for it to take place at 70 which is where he was.</v>

8
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:15.174
<v Speaker 1>So he can say like,</v>

9
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>I can do this exactly the same weight and then it won't be a factor,</v>

10
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

11
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>But also I think he was really healthy at one 70 and I think you'd like it was</v>

12
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.113
<v Speaker 1>Connor.</v>

13
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>I think you felt great leading up to the camp and leading up to the fight.</v>

14
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.480
<v Speaker 1>He just had a bad game plan and his ground Game Kinda got exposed to weight</v>

15
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 1>classes above where you want to title two weight classes.</v>

16
00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:35.754
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

17
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.211
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

18
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>they both weighed in almost exactly the same.</v>

19
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>No two way classes above where he won his title.</v>

20
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.071
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

21
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>But not really.</v>

22
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.890
<v Speaker 1>All it is is they're not cutting weight.</v>

23
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.641
<v Speaker 1>It's too,</v>

24
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:45.474
<v Speaker 1>but he's not white.</v>

25
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

26
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.320
<v Speaker 1>But he's not fighting like Damien Maia who used to fight at two oh five or 185</v>

27
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:55.260
<v Speaker 1>and he's cutting down title shop and listen that title shots where it's like you</v>

28
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>don't deserve title shot on two weight classes above you.</v>

29
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>It's just a Nate Diaz fight.</v>

30
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Well this isn't a title shot,</v>

31
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.571
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying at least.</v>

32
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

33
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.321
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

34
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>you know the whole story behind it,</v>

35
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>there was a fallout Hofeld dos Anjos is the lightweight champion was supposed to</v>

36
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>be fighting Conor McGregor.</v>

37
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>He breaks his foot 11 days before the fight.</v>

38
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz takes the fight at the drop of a hat.</v>

39
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>No training whatsoever.</v>

40
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean fucking none.</v>

41
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>They hadn't done anything.</v>

42
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Speaker 1>He was at the store.</v>

43
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

44
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:18.391
<v Speaker 1>he was hanging,</v>

45
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>hanging out and uh,</v>

46
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>Nate,</v>

47
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>posted pictures afterwards of him drinking Tequila and hanging out in Mexico</v>

49
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>eating tacos and shit.</v>

50
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>So he was just having a car nine bitch.</v>

51
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>He's just living his life.</v>

52
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:29.491
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

53
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>But he's in such good shape that he can get away with that because he does so</v>

54
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>much triathlon training.</v>

55
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>He's constantly biking and swimming and running.</v>

56
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker 1>He entered into a bunch of triathlons.</v>

57
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>He's in very good shape and so he was able to pull it off cause his cardio base</v>

58
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>was so good and just,</v>

59
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking damn good fighter.</v>

60
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>He's a damn good fighter.</v>

61
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>And he signed too.</v>

62
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.870
<v Speaker 1>And he's fought legitimately at one 70 twice.</v>

63
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.823
<v Speaker 1>He lost,</v>

64
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 1>he lost a stun gun,</v>

65
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:54.451
<v Speaker 1>Kim.</v>

66
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:58.210
<v Speaker 1>And he also lost a Roy McDonald at one 70 these are the legitimate one.</v>

67
00:01:58.211 --> 00:02:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Seventies and Roy being one of the best ones.</v>

68
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.781
<v Speaker 1>The world.</v>

69
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

70
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>he got ragdolled a little bit by Rory,</v>

71
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>but you know that was a wake up call for him.</v>

72
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>He went back to one 55 and at one 55 in his last fight against Michael Johnson,</v>

73
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>he put on probably the best performance up to the Conor McGregor fight,</v>

74
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>the best performance of his career.</v>

75
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>He was funny sensation.</v>

76
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>When I view Nate Diaz,</v>

77
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>I view,</v>

78
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>I think of him as a 50 fiver.</v>

79
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.021
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

80
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:20.700
<v Speaker 1>that's what he usually competes at.</v>

81
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>But for this fight,</v>

82
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>like he didn't want to have to cut weight.</v>

83
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>It's only 11 days out and he's a little heavy.</v>

84
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:25.231
<v Speaker 1>So he says,</v>

85
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:25.411
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

86
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.970
<v Speaker 1>let's make it one 70 they both agree.</v>

87
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.691
<v Speaker 1>Nate Wade,</v>

88
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>one 69 Konner weighed one 68 or maybe vice versa.</v>

89
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I think that's it though.</v>

90
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>So I mean they're basically the same size or they fight at one.</v>

91
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Well they fought at one 70 what do you mean when,</v>

92
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>when Nate said I'll fight it once every,</v>

93
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>where was he walking up?</v>

94
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Probably a little heavier than that.</v>

95
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>He probably died it and worked out real hard for seven or eight days of the 11</v>

96
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.260
<v Speaker 1>carpet honors class.</v>

97
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Koppel.</v>

98
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.141
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

99
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Connor didn't have to cut anything.</v>

100
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

101
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:51.511
<v Speaker 1>if he cut anything,</v>

102
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:52.590
<v Speaker 1>it probably a couple pounds,</v>

103
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.650
<v Speaker 1>which is not,</v>

104
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.110
<v Speaker 1>not not a biggest thing that happens.</v>

105
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>One 70 but there's not even 10 pounds different.</v>

106
00:02:58.321 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 1>So the same way,</v>

107
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>like when they got into the octagon,</v>

108
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you they're within a pound or two of each other.</v>

109
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

110
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>But Nate is longer and taller and he's a very good boxer.</v>

111
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Like Nate's bars on a regular basis with Andre Ward,</v>

112
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>who was one of the best pound for pound,</v>

113
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>if not the best pound for pound box or in the world.</v>

114
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Now that Floyd Mayweather,</v>

115
00:03:17.671 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 1>so quote unquote retired.</v>

116
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Andre Ward is a mother fucker and he just fought this Saturday night on HBO and</v>

117
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I just watched it the other day.</v>

118
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

119
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>on a DVR.</v>

120
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking amazing.</v>

121
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 1>He's so good,</v>

122
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

123
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>He's such a,</v>

124
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.950
<v Speaker 1>he's just nasty and he's now he's fighting at one 75 he's gonna fight surge Jay</v>

125
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Sergey Kovalev who's like the best one,</v>

126
00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>75 are in the world.</v>

127
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 1>So he fought so neat spars with that guy and a day on a regular basis like their</v>

128
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

129
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>And you know Nate also spars his brother Nick cause one of the best strikers in</v>

130
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>the UFC.</v>

131
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Definitely one of the best boxers.</v>

132
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

133
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 1>he's a very good boxer.</v>

134
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

135
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>and he also spars with Joe Schilling all the time.</v>

136
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Who is a glory world champion kickboxing world champion.</v>

137
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 1>He's a motherfucker man.</v>

138
00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>So native sparring with like high level world class striker is like legitimate.</v>

139
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.621
<v Speaker 1>Andre Ward,</v>

140
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Joe Shelley,</v>

141
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>two world champions in two d respective disciplines.</v>

142
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>

143
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

144
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I just think that people,</v>

145
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>he sees him swearing and stick it up his double fingers and they don't realize</v>

146
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.561
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

147
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Put all that shit aside and observe his movements,</v>

148
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 1>observe his movements in a fight like in the Michael Johnson fight in the,</v>

149
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

150
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>the gummy fight in the markets.</v>

151
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:25.921
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

152
00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 1>his fight in the gray Maynard fight.</v>

153
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Observe his movements.</v>

154
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 1>He's a motherfucker dude.</v>

155
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.740
<v Speaker 1>When he tees off on you,</v>

156
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 1>he comes at you like a snake.</v>

157
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.840
<v Speaker 1>He's got long ass on the most connections of all time where it's like 80% of his</v>

158
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.940
<v Speaker 1>strucks hit strikes hit in the first round.</v>

159
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 1>He Lit Donald Up.</v>

160
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

161
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:44.261
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

162
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:44.910
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

163
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>He nothing missed.</v>

164
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 1>He let Donald Up.</v>

165
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 1>He fucked Donald up in that first round.</v>

166
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Donald Donald Donald started coming back with leg kicks.</v>

167
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 1>The only guy who's ever really successfully like put him away in the UFC was</v>

168
00:04:56.261 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Josh Thompson and Josh Thompson is one of the most underrated guys.</v>

169
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

170
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 1>he's Josh Thompson.</v>

171
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>When he was at his best left to go over strike force and a lot of people missed</v>

172
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:09.550
<v Speaker 1>out on some of the fucking wars that he had over there.</v>

173
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 1>And the Gilbert Melendez fights over there and he went through,</v>

174
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>a lot of wear and tear on you.</v>

176
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.430
<v Speaker 1>But like skill for skill.</v>

177
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Josh Thompson is a motherfucker but he's now,</v>

178
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:22.630
<v Speaker 1>he's like 36 time just starts to get everybody but at his best.</v>

179
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think that like his last fight with Nate Diaz when he had kicked,</v>

180
00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean he stopped him.</v>

181
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 1>It was one of his best performances ever.</v>

182
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.600
<v Speaker 1>And then they had some losses after that,</v>

183
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:31.961
<v Speaker 1>but it can't,</v>

184
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's hard to stay healthy and get through a camp when you're 36 years</v>

185
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:35.441
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

186
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>When those guys get to the late thirties things start to get,</v>

187
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 1>so he has one loss.</v>

188
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Speaker 1>But the loss in my opinion,</v>

189
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean one stoppage loss,</v>

190
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.770
<v Speaker 1>but the loss to Thompson is like,</v>

191
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>well he's one of the most underrated guys.</v>

192
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 1>So it's like solid loss.</v>

193
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.521
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

194
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:49.151
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't get,</v>

195
00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get looked at as solid as it should be.</v>

196
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I think Thompson at its best is he's a motherfucker.</v>

197
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

198
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.761
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

199
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:56.290
<v Speaker 1>so let's say he's a natural one 70,</v>

200
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>or let's say he wants to fight the Conor,</v>

201
00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.571
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>

202
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:02.750
<v Speaker 1>he just wants to fight this fight at one 70 and prove his point that he could</v>

203
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>win point to fight exactly the way they did it before and to come in and fight</v>

204
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.240
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

205
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 1>This is what happened.</v>

206
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 1>If they're going to do that in the meantime there's lit Frankie and Aldo fight</v>

207
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:11.654
<v Speaker 1>for a title.</v>

208
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

209
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 1>How long are you gonna vacate the belt that you haven't defended once Max</v>

210
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Holloway should be in the mix as well?</v>

211
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

212
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.220
<v Speaker 1>I think they also offered,</v>

213
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.930
<v Speaker 1>although a shot at Mcgregor and he didn't take it,</v>

214
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

215
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 1>it could it be a Brazilian thing,</v>

216
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>if you know what I mean.</v>

217
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

218
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.740
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

219
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.573
<v Speaker 1>And steroids,</v>

220
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.910
<v Speaker 1>like you made the injection heroin,</v>

221
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 1>they'll do that.</v>

222
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.363
<v Speaker 1>They still do that,</v>

223
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 1>but for sure it,</v>

224
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

225
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.480
<v Speaker 1>I would say it was more like he's just an unprepared and out of shape and they</v>

226
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:39.530
<v Speaker 1>want to get knocked out again.</v>

227
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

228
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 1>the guy just knocked him out with why fucking punch a couple of months ago.</v>

229
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>

230
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.001
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

231
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

232
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.820
<v Speaker 1>give me that rematch because it can be imagined.</v>

233
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

234
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.581
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

235
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know that Connor was going to get worked.</v>

236
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 1>When of got worked by Nate Diaz.</v>

237
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:52.430
<v Speaker 1>It changed the whole game.</v>

238
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

239
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.821
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

240
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:53.654
<v Speaker 1>I can change.</v>

241
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Everything changed,</v>

242
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:55.041
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

243
00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Everything changed in everyone's approach to him.</v>

244
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>When you watch a guy get beat up and strangled like that,</v>

245
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.853
<v Speaker 1>you gotta pee again.</v>

246
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and do it.</v>

247
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.751
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

248
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:03.584
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>

249
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Talking about this.</v>

250
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:05.653
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it man.</v>

251
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.420
<v Speaker 1>But my point is for the folks listing,</v>

252
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 1>when you watch a guy get beat up,</v>

253
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.530
<v Speaker 1>like Conor got beat up against Nate and he shoots for a take down and then it</v>

254
00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:16.100
<v Speaker 1>gets taken down naked on top of them,</v>

255
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 1>beats him up and then chokes him a taps real quick.</v>

256
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Like Nate just dominated them.</v>

257
00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:21.464
<v Speaker 1>Once it got to the ground,</v>

258
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.161
<v Speaker 1>he was already hurt.</v>

259
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:22.994
<v Speaker 1>When it got to the ground,</v>

260
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 1>then everybody goes,</v>

261
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

262
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.933
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

263
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Could Hofeld dos Anjos do this?</v>

264
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Could.</v>

265
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 1>And for a guy like Conor,</v>

266
00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the reasons why he wants his fight back is to prove that he</v>

267
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:35.174
<v Speaker 1>fucked up,</v>

268
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.570
<v Speaker 1>that he tried to take Nate out with big power bombs.</v>

269
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 1>He gassed out,</v>

270
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.860
<v Speaker 1>he got tired and then Nate boxed him up in the second round.</v>

271
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Nate start tagging him,</v>

272
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.370
<v Speaker 1>had him hurt and had them shoot for takedown.</v>

273
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 1>So a guy like Conor,</v>

274
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.880
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to be that good.</v>

275
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:51.020
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to be that far.</v>

276
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:52.820
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to be that successful.</v>

277
00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to knock out all though with one punch at beat the fuck out of</v>

278
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in the first round,</v>

279
00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:00.560
<v Speaker 1>like you called it and beat the shit out of Seaver and stopped Chad Mendez when</v>

280
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to bet millions of dollars on it.</v>

281
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

282
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 1>he's a legit 100% motherfucker,</v>

283
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.140
<v Speaker 1>but the game does not care about personalities.</v>

284
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:16.390
<v Speaker 1>The game does not care about confidence to interaction of fists and face and</v>

285
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:19.580
<v Speaker 1>chokes and next and kicks and bodies.</v>

286
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 1>It does not care about anything other than what works.</v>

287
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:23.810
<v Speaker 1>So like when you see it,</v>

288
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 1>a loss like a Rhonda Rousey getting knocked the fuck out by Holly Holm,</v>

289
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.050
<v Speaker 1>it does not mean that Ronda Rousey sucks.</v>

290
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 1>It does not mean that Holly Holm is the greatest ever.</v>

291
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.300
<v Speaker 1>It just means that the game doesn't give a fuck who you are.</v>

292
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.381
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't care.</v>

293
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 1>You want to charge face first at a counter striker and she clips you with that</v>

294
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:41.354
<v Speaker 1>first punch.</v>

295
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Your are ready at CEC or already at check,</v>

296
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>you got rocked like the first punch and then you're getting beat up for four and</v>

297
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>a half minutes after that and then the second round comes around.</v>

298
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:53.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know where the fuck you are.</v>

299
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Your ears are going.</v>

300
00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:56.523
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

301
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.130
<v Speaker 1>You can't see your fucking eyes are blurry.</v>

302
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.330
<v Speaker 1>It must be so weird.</v>

303
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying.</v>

304
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.270
<v Speaker 1>That's what I love about UFC as opposed to boxing.</v>

305
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Nobody goes 29 to no,</v>

306
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:07.940
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

307
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you go six in a row,</v>

308
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:10.400
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>

309
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.060
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

310
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:11.900
<v Speaker 1>That's why John Jones,</v>

311
00:09:11.901 --> 00:09:12.734
<v Speaker 1>it's so spooky.</v>

312
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

313
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's beating Jon Jones.</v>

314
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones.</v>

315
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones has one loss and it's a disqualification.</v>

316
00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:20.180
<v Speaker 1>It's Matt Hamill and where he was caressing him.</v>

317
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

318
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.710
<v Speaker 1>On top of them.</v>

319
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.371
<v Speaker 1>And it was a,</v>

320
00:09:22.371 --> 00:09:23.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a dumb rule.</v>

321
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like a 12 to six elbows from on a clock face.</v>

322
00:09:26.541 --> 00:09:28.400
<v Speaker 1>If you drop an elbow down from 12 to six,</v>

323
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.950
<v Speaker 1>the people that made the rules thought that that's somehow or another,</v>

324
00:09:30.951 --> 00:09:31.784
<v Speaker 1>it was dangerous.</v>

325
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.700
<v Speaker 1>It's no different than any other kind of elbows.</v>

326
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.543
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

327
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:34.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

328
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:35.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a stupid rule.</v>

329
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a rule that they put in place because the people that were on the</v>

330
00:09:38.301 --> 00:09:39.020
<v Speaker 1>commission,</v>

331
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.940
<v Speaker 1>this is coming from big John McCarthy himself.</v>

332
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.430
<v Speaker 1>The people that were on the commission at the time,</v>

333
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.091
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

334
00:09:44.091 --> 00:09:44.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

335
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.970
<v Speaker 1>they thought that if you dropped a 12 to six elbow,</v>

336
00:09:46.971 --> 00:09:48.660
<v Speaker 1>like those ESPN karate shows,</v>

337
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.300
<v Speaker 1>he could break bricks and shit.</v>

338
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.170
<v Speaker 1>You could kill somebody.</v>

339
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:52.910
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

340
00:09:52.911 --> 00:09:53.744
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

341
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.250
<v Speaker 1>they made it illegal.</v>

342
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.731
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

343
00:09:55.731 --> 00:09:56.750
<v Speaker 1>it's not even 12 to six.</v>

344
00:09:56.751 --> 00:09:57.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like one to seven.</v>

345
00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.360
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid.</v>

346
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.440
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid.</v>

347
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.491
<v Speaker 1>He really,</v>

348
00:10:01.491 --> 00:10:02.270
<v Speaker 1>I could fight again.</v>

349
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.340
<v Speaker 1>It's really almost never 12 to six.</v>

350
00:10:04.341 --> 00:10:05.900
<v Speaker 1>It's always at a slight angle,</v>

351
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.520
<v Speaker 1>but either way it's fucking dumb.</v>

352
00:10:07.521 --> 00:10:08.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a dumb rule.</v>

353
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.103
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

354
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

355
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:11.803
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

356
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.291
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

357
00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:15.160
<v Speaker 1>we have Nate Diaz calling indoors sports podcast.</v>

379
00:10:34.811 --> 00:10:36.070
<v Speaker 3>And they're so fucking good at it.</v>

380
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.330
<v Speaker 3>For a while they were dating Ronda Rousey and GSP was all upset about it because</v>

381
00:10:40.331 --> 00:10:41.770
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to date Ronda Rousey and they,</v>

382
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.220
<v Speaker 3>they catfished him and buried him and buried him in a,</v>

383
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:44.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

384
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.000
<v Speaker 3>on a,</v>

385
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.140
<v Speaker 3>a refrigerator box and the desert.</v>

386
00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.123
<v Speaker 3>He got out.</v>

387
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.080
<v Speaker 3>And now GSP is addicted to kitty litter pick.</v>

388
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:56.260
<v Speaker 3>Could you let her computers break talking to the aliens all the time?</v>

389
00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.500
<v Speaker 3>They told me I missed the 2:00 AM two minutes,</v>

390
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:00.523
<v Speaker 3>my life.</v>

391
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.170
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

392
00:11:02.171 --> 00:11:02.730
<v Speaker 3>I've got to hit,</v>

393
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:03.490
<v Speaker 3>is that on,</v>

394
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:04.480
<v Speaker 3>on youtube anywhere?</v>

395
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.140
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

396
00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:05.561
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

397
00:11:05.561 --> 00:11:08.260
<v Speaker 3>Not Youtube but punchdrunk sports.com I think he'd get clips.</v>

398
00:11:08.261 --> 00:11:09.011
<v Speaker 3>The daily motion was,</v>

399
00:11:09.011 --> 00:11:10.210
<v Speaker 3>I think they're all in daily motion,</v>

400
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:10.920
<v Speaker 3>Dave.</v>

401
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.753
<v Speaker 3>Any of that stuff.</v>

402
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:11.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

403
00:11:11.831 --> 00:11:13.270
<v Speaker 3>We got to click that Shit and put it on mute.</v>

404
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:13.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

405
00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you have clips?</v>

406
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.460
<v Speaker 1>I just don't like,</v>

407
00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:18.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

408
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no,</v>

409
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:23.450
<v Speaker 1>I can't give you a good reason that this is the reason why I think the rematches</v>

410
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.383
<v Speaker 1>is huge.</v>

411
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.440
<v Speaker 1>This is why you have to do it.</v>

412
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

413
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:26.461
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

414
00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:27.540
<v Speaker 1>because Conor Mcgregor,</v>

415
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:32.090
<v Speaker 1>up until that fight is one of the most spectacular fighters ever tag people were</v>

416
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 1>talking about him.</v>

417
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

418
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Just the spectacle in that sense of spectacular.</v>

419
00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:40.380
<v Speaker 1>The guy gets on stage and screams the lands and the crowd goes nuts in the Irish</v>

420
00:11:40.381 --> 00:11:40.830
<v Speaker 1>flags.</v>

421
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

422
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:41.910
<v Speaker 3>Galvanized the nation.</v>

423
00:11:41.911 --> 00:11:42.960
<v Speaker 3>And I don't even know what galvanize</v>

424
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:43.611
<v Speaker 1>it means.</v>

425
00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Like a coating when you get nail so they don't rust.</v>

426
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

427
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

428
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.280
<v Speaker 1>he's spectacular.</v>

429
00:11:49.281 --> 00:11:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

430
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.670
<v Speaker 1>And his results inside the Ark gut other than Nate Diaz fight,</v>

431
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.460
<v Speaker 1>had incredibly dramatic calling.</v>

432
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:55.151
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

433
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:55.984
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>

434
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 1>second round,</v>

435
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll kill him with an uppercut and knock him out.</v>

436
00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:58.871
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like,</v>

437
00:11:58.871 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

438
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:02.250
<v Speaker 1>But when a guy like Nate Diaz beat you,</v>

439
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:03.161
<v Speaker 1>beat you,</v>

440
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 1>the way he beat you,</v>

441
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.000
<v Speaker 1>the bright thing to do is to have a rematch.</v>

442
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.863
<v Speaker 1>And this why?</v>

443
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Because the rematch is where the big money's at.</v>

444
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 1>The Murray match with Nate Diaz is God damn scrooge.</v>

445
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Mcduck gigantic die.</v>

446
00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:17.374
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

447
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.740
<v Speaker 1>2 million plus paper view of eyes.</v>

448
00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.620
<v Speaker 1>It's still on the table.</v>

449
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:21.280
<v Speaker 1>If it goes,</v>

450
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.890
<v Speaker 1>let's just say it goes to 45 then maybe 55 again,</v>

451
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.030
<v Speaker 1>there's always going to be like,</v>

452
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.181
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

453
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean they DSL pitcher,</v>

454
00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:26.501
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

455
00:12:26.501 --> 00:12:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

456
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

457
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.230
<v Speaker 1>but here's the other problem.</v>

458
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.820
<v Speaker 1>What Frankie might beat him.</v>

459
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

460
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Everyone Holloway.</v>

461
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Max Holloway might beat him in a rematch.</v>

462
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

463
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

464
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Jose Aldo might beat them now.</v>

465
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Now that Joseph especially Jolen we all know</v>

466
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Josie Aldo.</v>

467
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

468
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:45.990
<v Speaker 1>it comes in real healthy.</v>

469
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.833
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

470
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.123
<v Speaker 1>If he</v>

471
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:49.910
<v Speaker 1>chose a,</v>

472
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 1>although he is a fucking nine year undefeated all time,</v>

473
00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:56.980
<v Speaker 1>great fighter who got clipped with one big punch.</v>

474
00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.750
<v Speaker 1>So what if Aldo fights like in a similar way to how Misha Tate fought.</v>

475
00:13:01.751 --> 00:13:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Holly Holm takes his time.</v>

476
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Where's that motherfucker out?</v>

477
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 1>And like round two or three and just stays on the outside and leg kicks the shit</v>

478
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:10.030
<v Speaker 1>out of him if all don't just choose just to have,</v>

479
00:13:10.031 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean all it was so mad.</v>

480
00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:13.480
<v Speaker 1>He tried to take his head off with a left hook and he got clipped.</v>

481
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.010
<v Speaker 1>He would load it up and he got clipped.</v>

482
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.240
<v Speaker 1>But what if he doesn't do that?</v>

483
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.370
<v Speaker 1>What if he goes in there and play slow on the outside?</v>

484
00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Starts kicking his legs?</v>

485
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.680
<v Speaker 1>What if he initiates a clinch?</v>

486
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Cause let me tell you something about all those Jujitsu.</v>

487
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:27.870
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking world class like you watch or Aldo versus Mike Brown in the UFC or</v>

488
00:13:29.321 --> 00:13:30.910
<v Speaker 1>the WC rather when he wanted to Walter,</v>

489
00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.980
<v Speaker 1>they'll featherweight title can't get anything.</v>

490
00:13:32.981 --> 00:13:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

491
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.660
<v Speaker 1>When he won the featherweight title to it,</v>

492
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:38.470
<v Speaker 1>he takes his back like a fucking world champion and smashes him.</v>

493
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 1>So a cyborgs in the UFC now too.</v>

494
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.823
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

495
00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:42.641
<v Speaker 1>I just heard that from you.</v>

496
00:13:42.641 --> 00:13:43.474
<v Speaker 1>We're open pool.</v>

497
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.140
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

498
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:44.973
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

499
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.473
<v Speaker 1>finally.</v>

500
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

501
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.180
<v Speaker 1>At one 41 40 yeah.</v>

502
00:13:49.181 --> 00:13:50.700
<v Speaker 1>The pro rada thoughts finds it.</v>

503
00:13:50.701 --> 00:13:52.030
<v Speaker 1>35 yes.</v>

504
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.110
<v Speaker 1>And she's going to fight Leslie Smith who fights at one 35 she's,</v>

505
00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:00.040
<v Speaker 1>it's the girl at her ear exploded or year got torn off by Jessica.</v>

506
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:00.874
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

507
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.713
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem?</v>

508
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:02.801
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

509
00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:04.330
<v Speaker 1>well it's not a problem,</v>

510
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's a one 40 pound weight class instead of a one 45 that's the one 45 is</v>

511
00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:10.150
<v Speaker 1>what she's champion of in Invicta.</v>

512
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:14.020
<v Speaker 1>And I think the idea is that they worry that they don't have enough 145 pound</v>

513
00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:14.854
<v Speaker 1>talent.</v>

514
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.660
<v Speaker 1>I think they didn't have enough hunter [inaudible] I know for sure that it</v>

515
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.450
<v Speaker 1>didn't have 115 pound talent.</v>

516
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Some of the third bout to get somebody a third rematch in five years.</v>

517
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

518
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.340
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

519
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:28.781
<v Speaker 1>But you mean me?</v>

520
00:14:28.781 --> 00:14:32.380
<v Speaker 1>She taped it was like you don't have a deep enough way class if that's what you</v>

521
00:14:32.381 --> 00:14:33.040
<v Speaker 1>keep doing.</v>

522
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:33.671
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

523
00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:34.361
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

524
00:14:34.361 --> 00:14:36.880
<v Speaker 1>but I mean that's the same problem they're going to have right now at</v>

525
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:37.660
<v Speaker 1>welterweight.</v>

526
00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.050
<v Speaker 1>The same problem you're talking about at one 45 which has a lot of talent.</v>

527
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.220
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of talented one 45 in men's.</v>

528
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.550
<v Speaker 1>So this is what I think.</v>

529
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.091
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

530
00:14:46.091 --> 00:14:46.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

531
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.283
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

532
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.580
<v Speaker 1>she's fucking terrifying.</v>

533
00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about like one of the scariest strikers in MMA,</v>

534
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:53.301
<v Speaker 1>cyborgs.</v>

535
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying.</v>

536
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.790
<v Speaker 1>And Tony and I got in trouble because we,</v>

537
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:55.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

538
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.810
<v Speaker 1>said some inappropriate jokes about what would a roast w be like with her.</v>

539
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.010
<v Speaker 1>All jokes aside,</v>

540
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.770
<v Speaker 1>even before that I had tweeted that a,</v>

541
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see her in the UFC for sure.</v>

542
00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:06.951
<v Speaker 1>She's name,</v>

543
00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:07.641
<v Speaker 1>she's a monster.</v>

544
00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:11.540
<v Speaker 1>And I think also we shouldn't have double standards as far as who takes</v>

545
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:12.650
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing drugs,</v>

546
00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:13.820
<v Speaker 1>whether it's for men or for women,</v>

547
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.000
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

548
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.280
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

549
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:15.500
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

550
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.900
<v Speaker 1>like things are kind of is I think the way people look at it,</v>

551
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:22.510
<v Speaker 1>what a woman is taking testosterone versus a man taking testosterone because</v>

552
00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.410
<v Speaker 1>it's already part of your body.</v>

553
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:25.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

554
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:26.181
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

555
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:26.571
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

556
00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Speaker 1>like some of the things that men have been caught with have been pretty</v>

557
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.350
<v Speaker 1>unnatural as well.</v>

558
00:15:30.351 --> 00:15:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Like super human levels of testosterone that don't even exist in medical books,</v>

559
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:34.881
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

560
00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:36.410
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

561
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.340
<v Speaker 1>you could argue that it's dangerous because a woman does change her anatomy.</v>

562
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Whatever they're testing are now.</v>

563
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

564
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.070
<v Speaker 1>But your anatomy changes.</v>

565
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

566
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:43.790
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

567
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.530
<v Speaker 1>But you have to make a weight class.</v>

568
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.271
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

569
00:15:46.271 --> 00:15:47.000
<v Speaker 1>it's tricky man.</v>

570
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:47.241
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

571
00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:51.200
<v Speaker 1>it always seen before this Holly Holm thing happened and that's all fishy too.</v>

572
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.303
<v Speaker 1>What's fishy?</v>

573
00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda won't take a fight,</v>

574
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:55.670
<v Speaker 1>won't take a fight against Holly Holm,</v>

575
00:15:55.671 --> 00:15:56.840
<v Speaker 1>and then it's suddenly like Misha Tate.</v>

576
00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:57.170
<v Speaker 1>When's like,</v>

577
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.003
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to fight now.</v>

578
00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:58.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

579
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.761
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

580
00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:00.170
<v Speaker 1>She's not necessarily ready to fight now.</v>

581
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.621
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

582
00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:01.070
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

583
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:01.640
<v Speaker 1>she's not,</v>

584
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.020
<v Speaker 1>she can't fight until like November.</v>

585
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.883
<v Speaker 1>She is,</v>

586
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 1>she's gotten movie obligations.</v>

587
00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:06.140
<v Speaker 1>They got moved around.</v>

588
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.730
<v Speaker 1>See that's bad right there,</v>

589
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.650
<v Speaker 1>right when the movies get in the way.</v>

590
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

591
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Of your fights.</v>

592
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Like you gotta pick one or the other.</v>

593
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:13.813
<v Speaker 1>So in between,</v>

594
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:14.813
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

595
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

596
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:16.760
<v Speaker 1>as soon as my fights over,</v>

597
00:16:16.761 --> 00:16:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I can do your movie for the next three months and then I got her back to</v>

598
00:16:18.831 --> 00:16:19.280
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

599
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.880
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be hard though when you're a,</v>

600
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:21.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

601
00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:25.340
<v Speaker 1>a super celebrity and you're getting all this love and everybody wants to put</v>

602
00:16:25.341 --> 00:16:26.300
<v Speaker 1>you in all these different things.</v>

603
00:16:26.301 --> 00:16:28.250
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be hard to say no to certain things obviously.</v>

604
00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:29.061
<v Speaker 1>But the same shit happens.</v>

605
00:16:29.061 --> 00:16:29.900
<v Speaker 1>A female comics.</v>

606
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:30.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

607
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:33.920
<v Speaker 1>But it's way worse with a fighter because of fighter has to be physically tuned</v>

608
00:16:33.921 --> 00:16:37.010
<v Speaker 1>up to go in to do battle and get kicked in the fucking,</v>

609
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:37.131
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

610
00:16:37.131 --> 00:16:37.710
<v Speaker 1>It's way worse.</v>

611
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:38.110
<v Speaker 1>A fighter.</v>

612
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.060
<v Speaker 1>It's just similar where it's like you're not concentrating on the thing that got</v>

613
00:16:41.061 --> 00:16:41.570
<v Speaker 1>you there.</v>

614
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.220
<v Speaker 1>So the thing that got you there is now suffering.</v>

615
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

616
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't care anymore.</v>

617
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you just want to do movies.</v>

618
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.513
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

619
00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
