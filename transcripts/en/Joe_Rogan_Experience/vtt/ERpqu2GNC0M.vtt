00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.120
<v Speaker 1>like I remember when I lived in Aspen,</v>

3
00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:10.121
<v Speaker 1>they have the Esi body guard academy and aspect that stand that I don't know,</v>

4
00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:18.371
<v Speaker 1>but the guy supposedly was in a room six by 12 room where he killed 12 Mexicans</v>

5
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.330
<v Speaker 1>at knife point with his bands.</v>

6
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.420
<v Speaker 1>So he opens up this uh,</v>

7
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Esi thing and it's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:26.531
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

12
00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:31.531
<v Speaker 1>it's a summer long program and you learn how to adjust up at the high altitude</v>

13
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>and drive and evasive driving and shooting.</v>

14
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Then they have a course on maritime,</v>

15
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>how to defend people out on the ocean and all that stuff.</v>

16
00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:40.910
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

17
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.300
<v Speaker 1>she aspen and all those places like Woody Creek,</v>

18
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:46.010
<v Speaker 1>where you went to his home,</v>

19
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.550
<v Speaker 1>to the baddest retired soldiers in the world and you don't know who they are.</v>

20
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 1>You just think that dude over there with the American flag is mowing the lawn.</v>

21
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.970
<v Speaker 1>That guy killed 80 people want to add them because got,</v>

22
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.320
<v Speaker 1>just got endeavor that I know.</v>

23
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

24
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.150

<v Speaker 1>why they put them.</v>

28
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Because the mountain is to keep them away from civilization for these people</v>

29
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.340
<v Speaker 1>just in case they get Chinese music somewhere else.</v>

30
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever want that to happen.</v>

31
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Break glass in case of war.</v>

35
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:22.304
<v Speaker 1>I believe it.</v>

36
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.990
<v Speaker 1>The motherfucker used to get picked up at Aspen and put in the helicopter job</v>

37
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.751
<v Speaker 1>like they said,</v>

38
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:31.610
<v Speaker 1>like a helicopter with two guys jumping out for guys around them and he would</v>

39
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:32.680
<v Speaker 1>just wave and uncle joey.</v>

41
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 1>the green berets and all these guys were sitting around the thing cooking chili</v>

43
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>and it was telling how many people they killed.</v>

44
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Killed 18.</v>

45
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I killed 22.</v>

46
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile he was stirring the soup with his big over the fire.</v>

47
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.111
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

48
00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the type of stories this guy would tell me.</v>

49
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.200
<v Speaker 1>He had me all fucked up in their head and I asked him once I go,</v>

50
00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:01.460
<v Speaker 1>should I go to that Esi?</v>

51
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.361
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

52
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:03.020
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

53
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.900
<v Speaker 1>I go in there and smack them all with my left hand,</v>

54
00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:06.734
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

55
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

56
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.550
<v Speaker 1>you can't teach what you need to learn over there because four years of Charlie</v>

57
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 1>and the Bush is a lot better than 12 weeks.</v>

58
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Are you hanging out with some white dudes which suits shooting people targets in</v>

59
00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:21.020
<v Speaker 1>the mind?</v>

60
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not real.</v>

61
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.090
<v Speaker 1>It's not until there's real concert six that is a big part of what the,</v>

62
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.670
<v Speaker 1>election was about talking me.</v>

64
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.550
<v Speaker 1>You making a say and think things or just letting things be real.</v>

65
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:36.260
<v Speaker 1>it goes in cycles.</v>

67
00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:37.610
<v Speaker 1>We go one way and we go the other way.</v>

68
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.683
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

69
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.510
<v Speaker 1>It's just like we got tired of people going so hard politically.</v>

70
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:41.781
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

71
00:02:41.781 --> 00:02:43.850
<v Speaker 1>But you see how there's progress now.</v>

72
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Like we were talking about school.</v>

73
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

74
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:46.311
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

75
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:46.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

76
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:47.354
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

77
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's good.</v>

78
00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:50.420
<v Speaker 1>People would walk into our schools,</v>

79
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.450
<v Speaker 1>kids would walk up to other kids that were kind of slow.</v>

80
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 1>What are you retarded like right to their face.</v>

81
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.781
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>

82
00:02:56.781 --> 00:02:57.561
<v Speaker 1>He was a sped.</v>

83
00:02:57.561 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>He's retarded that exist anymore.</v>

84
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>And I think it still exists,</v>

85
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>it just exists less and not where your kids go to school in comparison to where</v>

86
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:05.914
<v Speaker 1>you go to school.</v>

87
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean a bit of La unified and you're hanging out in compton.</v>

88
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 1>I bet you see some bad shit in school.</v>

89
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.163
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

90
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 1>This is probably some bad shit's still going on in a lot of schools.</v>

91
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>A lot of kids are getting bullied and people understand the consequences of that</v>

92
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:19.601
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

93
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Like you're scared to go to class cause someone's going to hit you,</v>

94
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>scared to go to class.</v>

95
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:24.214
<v Speaker 1>Someone's beat new.</v>

96
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.070
<v Speaker 1>But bullying was just part of life isn't bullying.</v>

97
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>It was just life back then.</v>

98
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>But it was just bullying and it did ruin people's lives.</v>

99
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:30.851
<v Speaker 1>Did.</v>

100
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>But nobody called it out.</v>

101
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>No adult would help you out with it.</v>

102
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

103
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>it's just the way it went.</v>

104
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn how to take care of Shit.</v>

105
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>And everyone was being bullied by somebody else.</v>

106
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

107
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>it was dog eat dog.</v>

108
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.253
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

109
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

110
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.023
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

111
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

112
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I think that you're right.</v>

113
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean the politically correct thing.</v>

114
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 1>There's it swings that way and you're left with some good stuff and everybody</v>

115
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>adjusted and then it goes too far and you start to go after things that don't</v>

116
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>affect a lot of people.</v>

117
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

118
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>and then people get fed up.</v>

119
00:03:57.551 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 1>I will those.</v>

120
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>The thing is those people that go too far that go too far with all that</v>

121
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 1>politically correct stuff,</v>

122
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>they're almost always emotionally unbalanced,</v>

123
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.310
<v Speaker 1>so given enough time they will reveal themselves to be either crazy or power</v>

124
00:04:13.851 --> 00:04:18.851
<v Speaker 1>hungry or like really like a big part of that whole social justice warrior</v>

125
00:04:19.371 --> 00:04:21.890
<v Speaker 1>movement is really about shaming people,</v>

126
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.780
<v Speaker 1>like expressing anger,</v>

127
00:04:23.781 --> 00:04:25.070
<v Speaker 1>attacking people,</v>

128
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.061
<v Speaker 1>gaining power,</v>

129
00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:28.340
<v Speaker 1>punching people that disagree with you,</v>

130
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.091
<v Speaker 1>like punch,</v>

131
00:04:29.091 --> 00:04:30.170
<v Speaker 1>fascist punch,</v>

132
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.690
<v Speaker 1>punch Nazis like aggressive about it,</v>

133
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.690
<v Speaker 1>and that somehow know that this is a good thing as if because there's so</v>

134
00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:40.160
<v Speaker 1>delusional on so detached from real physical violence and they had this idea</v>

135
00:04:40.161 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 1>that you're just going to go out there and push these people and take back.</v>

136
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.861
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

137
00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:44.030
<v Speaker 1>they're going to show up with guns.</v>

138
00:04:44.031 --> 00:04:47.480
<v Speaker 1>You fuck like this is how wars get started to escalate.</v>

139
00:04:47.481 --> 00:04:48.410
<v Speaker 1>You try to control people.</v>

140
00:04:48.411 --> 00:04:49.161
<v Speaker 1>You pushed too far.</v>

141
00:04:49.161 --> 00:04:50.210
<v Speaker 1>You're not kind.</v>

142
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Instead you're shaming people,</v>

143
00:04:51.981 --> 00:04:54.320
<v Speaker 1>you're creating bad feelings and aggression,</v>

144
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.420
<v Speaker 1>like they've got this juvenile idea about confrontation that it just goes out</v>

145
00:04:59.421 --> 00:05:00.800
<v Speaker 1>there and it never comes back to you.</v>

146
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.010
<v Speaker 1>It always comes back with luck.</v>

147
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.923
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

148
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.040
<v Speaker 1>It comes back.</v>

149
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.820
<v Speaker 1>It comes back.</v>

150
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

151
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

152
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.531
<v Speaker 2>as much as,</v>

153
00:05:06.531 --> 00:05:06.811
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

154
00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:08.940
<v Speaker 2>as the son was to walk into his father's shoes,</v>

155
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

156
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.760
<v Speaker 2>it's just not worth it,</v>

157
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:11.430
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

158
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.710
<v Speaker 2>It's really nice and you're probably not going to be as good.</v>

159
00:05:13.711 --> 00:05:14.580
<v Speaker 2>That's just how,</v>

160
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.530
<v Speaker 2>what have you kid wanting to fight?</v>

161
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Like a bar,</v>

162
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 2>like box?</v>

163
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

164
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.031
<v Speaker 2>boxer,</v>

165
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:19.864
<v Speaker 2>kick boxer.</v>

166
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.590
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't advocate that either.</v>

167
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't let them do that.</v>

168
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm pushing them to go towards like a education.</v>

169
00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:27.600
<v Speaker 2>I want them to be scientists.</v>

170
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Like if I had to do it over again,</v>

171
00:05:29.071 --> 00:05:30.330
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have never played football.</v>

172
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.081
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

173
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:31.231
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

174
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:31.891
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a scientist.</v>

175
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:32.161
<v Speaker 2>Not even.</v>

176
00:05:32.161 --> 00:05:33.270
<v Speaker 2>You would start from the beginning,</v>

177
00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:36.150
<v Speaker 2>like if you could go back to college and knowing what you know now.</v>

178
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

179
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Not even close and just because of the damage to your body.</v>

180
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Well that and uh,</v>

181
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.410
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

182
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.243
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird,</v>

183
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.010
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing.</v>

184
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.311
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

185
00:05:47.311 --> 00:05:48.144
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

186
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.170
<v Speaker 2>you're in your prime physically as a,</v>

187
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.751
<v Speaker 2>as a man,</v>

188
00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:52.271
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

189
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:54.150
<v Speaker 2>you're in your infancy mentally,</v>

190
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

191
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

192
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 2>And so like I'm just now figuring out who am and what kind of man I want to be</v>

193
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 2>and you're,</v>

194
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

195
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 2>while you're in your prime,</v>

196
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.350
<v Speaker 2>that's when you're in the public eye,</v>

197
00:06:02.351 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 2>so you have to deal with all of that on top of figure so you're figuring out who</v>

198
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:07.150
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

199
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

200
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.433
<v Speaker 2>in a fishbowl.</v>

201
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 2>And it's a really weird,</v>

202
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 2>really weird thing.</v>

203
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 2>So I don't even want to deal like,</v>

204
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Speaker 2>like any kind of recommendation or any kind of</v>

205
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.060
<v Speaker 2>fame or whatever people want to call it.</v>

206
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:20.894
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't,</v>

207
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:21.621
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it,</v>

208
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:22.454
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it.</v>

209
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.250
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the best to me,</v>

210
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.273
<v Speaker 2>the best uh,</v>

211
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 2>society would be a artist and a scientist.</v>

212
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.030
<v Speaker 2>That would be a ideal society to me.</v>

213
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.831
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

214
00:06:32.831 --> 00:06:34.240
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting take on things.</v>

215
00:06:34.241 --> 00:06:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Considering how successful you've been playing football,</v>

216
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.201
<v Speaker 3>playing football,</v>

217
00:06:38.201 --> 00:06:41.680
<v Speaker 3>obviously it was very financially rewarding to you made you famous.</v>

218
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

219
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean if just some regular dude went on twitter and start talking about I can</v>

220
00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:47.200
<v Speaker 3>take a wool farmer.</v>

221
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.033
<v Speaker 3>I know that he killed,</v>

222
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.151
<v Speaker 3>nobody will care and be like,</v>

223
00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:49.451
<v Speaker 3>shut up,</v>

224
00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:51.400
<v Speaker 3>stupid that anybody cares anyway,</v>

225
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.263
<v Speaker 3>but it's</v>

226
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.290
<v Speaker 3>fucking my twitter bloated.</v>

227
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 3>But I said you were coming on</v>

228
00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.633
<v Speaker 3>school</v>

229
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.020
<v Speaker 3>was going to kill us.</v>

230
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

231
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

232
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.800
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

233
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.131
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

234
00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:09.851
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird.</v>

235
00:07:09.851 --> 00:07:11.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

236
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.490
<v Speaker 2>once you get to that,</v>

237
00:07:12.491 --> 00:07:16.360
<v Speaker 2>to that financial summit that everybody strives for that American dream.</v>

238
00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:19.870
<v Speaker 2>You realize that there is no there and if you ain't happy with $10,</v>

239
00:07:19.871 --> 00:07:21.520
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna be happy with a million.</v>

240
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 2>It's just not happening.</v>

241
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

242
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.750
<v Speaker 2>now granted there are some things that you need,</v>

243
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.100
<v Speaker 2>you need monetary,</v>

244
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.730
<v Speaker 2>a value in the society to,</v>

245
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:31.990
<v Speaker 2>to a certain extent.</v>

246
00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:32.741
<v Speaker 2>I think they did a study.</v>

247
00:07:32.741 --> 00:07:35.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like after $75,000 a year,</v>

248
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.790
<v Speaker 2>money can't buy happiness.</v>

249
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.670
<v Speaker 2>So everything else out there is kind of just,</v>

250
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:39.523
<v Speaker 2>it's just luxury.</v>

251
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.050
<v Speaker 2>And really if you put a perspective,</v>

252
00:07:41.051 --> 00:07:43.390
<v Speaker 2>I think like 35 percent.</v>

253
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:44.121
<v Speaker 2>I mean if,</v>

254
00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:44.471
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

255
00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

256
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.330
<v Speaker 2>if you make $35,000 a year,</v>

257
00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:48.070
<v Speaker 2>you're in the top one percent of wealth in the world.</v>

258
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

259
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:49.451
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

260
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

261
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

262
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.910
<v Speaker 2>it's all about perspective,</v>

263
00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:52.181
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

264
00:07:52.181 --> 00:07:52.840
<v Speaker 2>And once,</v>

265
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.200
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>

266
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:53.770
<v Speaker 2>once I,</v>

267
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.210
<v Speaker 2>it took me to get to that financial summit to understand that unfortunately,</v>

268
00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:01.570
<v Speaker 2>but the weird thing about it is once you tell people that and you're on top of</v>

269
00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:04.090
<v Speaker 2>this financial summit for you to say,</v>

270
00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:04.391
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

271
00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:05.020
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

272
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

273
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:06.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

274
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

275
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.721
<v Speaker 2>Easy for you to know.</v>

276
00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:08.930
<v Speaker 2>A lot of miserable millionaires.</v>

277
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.911
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

278
00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:10.540
<v Speaker 4>I was on a,</v>

279
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.670
<v Speaker 4>on a concord with Mohammed Ali,</v>

280
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

281
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.373
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

282
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.341
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

283
00:08:15.341 --> 00:08:16.174
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

284
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:17.321
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>

285
00:08:17.321 --> 00:08:17.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

286
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:17.951
<v Speaker 4>had his,</v>

287
00:08:17.951 --> 00:08:18.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

288
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.200
<v Speaker 4>Angelo Dundee is that the guy?</v>

289
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.690
<v Speaker 4>He had his entourage with him.</v>

290
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.020
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

291

297
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.140
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.960
<v Speaker 4>So I had been tuned up pretty good.</v>

305
00:08:51.011 --> 00:08:51.970
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was pretty tough.</v>

306
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.520
<v Speaker 4>I stood up and I said something back to them.</v>

307
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.060

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:12.670
