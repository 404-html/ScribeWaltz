1
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody,</v>

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 2>this episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by Lumosity.</v>

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Lumosity is essentially a one stop online gym for your brain and a what it is.</v>

5
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 2>It's all based on the science of neuroplasticity.</v>

6
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:27.141
<v Speaker 2>And what they do is they create a program for your specific goals to try to get</v>

7
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 2>your dome working better.</v>

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 2>It only makes sense to me that the human brain works just like pretty much</v>

9
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 2>everything else in the human body,</v>

10
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 2>like the lungs and like,</v>

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.843
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

12
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 2>you know what the muscles,</v>

13
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.911
<v Speaker 2>the more you use it,</v>

14
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:39.744
<v Speaker 2>the better it works.</v>

15
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.020
<v Speaker 2>And Lumosity is designed through a series of questions and a series of goals</v>

16
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 2>that you set up in advance.</v>

17
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:49.890
<v Speaker 2>They cater each individual program for you,</v>

18
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 2>designed to help you with your specific functions,</v>

19
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:57.201
<v Speaker 2>whether it's memory or whether it's a tension or speed flexibility,</v>

20
00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 2>communicating clearly thinking outside the box.</v>

21
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 2>They have all these different parameters that you set.</v>

22
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:05.700
<v Speaker 2>You set them in advance and then what it creates is essentially like games.</v>

23
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker 2>They're fun games that you play that can increase your memory,</v>

24
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

25
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 2>increase your capacity to recall and recollect.</v>

26
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 2>Things.</v>

27
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 2>I think those are both the same things I just had to recall and recollect.</v>

28
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.131
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

29

<v Speaker 2>They have apps in the windows phone.</v>

105
00:03:36.451 --> 00:03:38.190
<v Speaker 3>n and I t.</v>

106
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

107
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 3>if you've seen all the,</v>

108
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 3>the recent hubbub about vitamins,</v>

109
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.421
<v Speaker 3>there's been this,</v>

110
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

111
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.511
<v Speaker 3>lately this,</v>

112
00:03:44.511 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 3>this big thing about vitamins and about how,</v>

113
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

114
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 3>vitamins are not good for you.</v>

115
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.470
<v Speaker 3>There was some new study that said that vitamins don't have any benefit.</v>

116
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 3>That's the conclusion that,</v>

117
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

118
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 3>people read when they were talking about it.</v>

119
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.500
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

120
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 3>that's not really what it said.</v>

121
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 3>What it really said is that vitamins didn't work and some very specific cases,</v>

122
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 3>like we're a old people were 65 years old.</v>

123
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 3>We're giving vitamins and it didn't help in any significant way to prevent them</v>

124
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:16.204
<v Speaker 3>from getting cancer.</v>

125
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 3>There's a few like very specific parameters.</v>

126
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 3>A study shows that high dose multivitamins have no effect on the progression of</v>

127
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:25.150
<v Speaker 3>heart disease and heart attack survivors.</v>

128
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 3>And then the other one was a limited,</v>

129
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 3>limited evidence supports any benefit from vitamin and mineral supplementation</v>

130
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 3>for the prevention of cancer or cardiovascular disease.</v>

131
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 3>These are three very specific things and on top of that,</v>

132
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:43.921
<v Speaker 3>there's been a a mound of evidence and a lot of it is listed at [inaudible] dot</v>

133
00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 3>com forward slash blog.</v>

134
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

135
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 3>we list a infectious illness prevention,</v>

136
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:54.031
<v Speaker 3>how they've been clinically and statistically proven to help prevent a lot of</v>

137
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 3>different issues that people have.</v>

138
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why they give it to people with scurvy.</v>

139
00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.931
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

140
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 3>They found out that scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin C.</v>

141
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why a,</v>

142
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 3>there was a couple recently that was tried for murder because their child died</v>

143
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 3>because it didn't have enough be 12 and the mother's milk because the family was</v>

144
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:10.981
<v Speaker 3>Vegan,</v>

145
00:05:10.981 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 3>like so vitamins,</v>

146
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:12.641
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

147
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 3>vitamins are legit.</v>

148
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 3>There are a hundred percent legit.</v>

149
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

150
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.260
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

151
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.160
<v Speaker 3>it's how's your body absorbing them?</v>

152
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 3>The closer the vitamins are based to food,</v>

153
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 3>the more easy your body's going to absorb them.</v>

154
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.781
<v Speaker 3>He bought,</v>

155
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 3>he's not supposed to be processing these synthetic vitamins that are filled with</v>

156
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 3>toxic binders and they come in this gelatinous capsule.</v>

157
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 3>Your body doesn't know what the fuck that is.</v>

158
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 3>It knows it's not a cheeseburger.</v>

159
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 3>It knows it's not a watermelon.</v>

160
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 3>It's something weird.</v>

161
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.800
<v Speaker 3>And so your body pisses a lot of it out at an add on it.</v>

162
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that we do is we don't sell any of those synthetic vitamins.</v>

163
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:43.481
<v Speaker 3>Everything we sell,</v>

164
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 3>it's food based.</v>

165
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 3>And that's all we ever recommend.</v>

166
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that you should be taking anything that is created in a lab.</v>

167
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 3>If you can get the same thing that it's extracted from food.</v>

168
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

169
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 3>there's an issue with some things.</v>

170
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:57.711
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

171
00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason why you take multivitamins is first of all,</v>

172
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 3>most of us don't really lead a balanced diet.</v>

173
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 3>So some form of supplementation.</v>

174
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:06.550
<v Speaker 3>I prefer a green,</v>

175
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 3>a green supplements like Spirulina or um,</v>

176
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.480
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of different live Greens that you can buy in supermarkets and you</v>

177
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.230
<v Speaker 3>throw those things in.</v>

178
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:22.670
<v Speaker 3>Blenders and all that stuff is the best way to get your mind your vitamins from</v>

179
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 3>leafy green vegetables and fruits and things along those lines.</v>

180
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 3>But it's not a bad thing to supplement outside of that.</v>

181
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 3>Even with synthetic vitamins,</v>

182
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 3>it's better than nothing.</v>

183
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 3>It might not have statistically proven effects on preventing heart disease and</v>

184
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:36.051
<v Speaker 3>old people,</v>

185
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 3>but these are from some pretty specific parameters that they're talking about.</v>

186
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:42.650
<v Speaker 3>So I think that the say case close might,</v>

187
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 3>vitamins and minerals don't work,</v>

188
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:45.344
<v Speaker 3>you're wasting their money.</v>

189
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 3>That stinks.</v>

190
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like someone's just trying to get a lot of attention for their,</v>

191
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 3>their study and it sounds like it's a,</v>

192
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:52.064
<v Speaker 3>it's a really,</v>

193
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 3>not just an inaccurate conclusion,</v>

194
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 3>but it seems,</v>

195
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.500
<v Speaker 3>it seems incompetent.</v>

196
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.041
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>

197
00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 3>it's an incompetent thing to say.</v>

198
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.820
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why Vitamix exists in the first place.</v>

199
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.350
<v Speaker 3>They've been documented,</v>

200
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 3>they figured out what they are.</v>

201
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.713
<v Speaker 3>They're not like,</v>

202
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 3>it's not like a myth.</v>

203
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.551
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>

204
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:09.050
<v Speaker 3>well this element has no effect.</v>

205
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:11.000
<v Speaker 3>Would that element does they know exactly what they are?</v>

206
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.863
<v Speaker 3>They extract them,</v>

207
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 3>they put them in pill form.</v>

208
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.650
<v Speaker 3>It's just a matter of how much of it is your body absorbing.</v>

209
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:17.150
<v Speaker 3>All vitamins are not created equally.</v>

210
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.960
<v Speaker 3>And you should look into all the positive benefits of,</v>

211
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 3>of vitamins that we've documented.</v>

212
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:24.590
<v Speaker 3>These are not our,</v>

213
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.550
<v Speaker 3>not our studies.</v>

214
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.190
<v Speaker 3>These are all peer reviewed and a pub,</v>

215
00:07:28.191 --> 00:07:29.024
<v Speaker 3>Med studies.</v>

216
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

217
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 3>we've got five of them listed on a,</v>

218
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 3>on a.com on a.com including,</v>

219
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

220
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 3>people talking about a,</v>

221
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:36.824
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

222
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.261
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

223
00:07:37.261 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 3>an improvement in cognition,</v>

224
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 3>release of some work,</v>

225
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:41.331
<v Speaker 3>stress,</v>

226
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:41.781
<v Speaker 3>mood,</v>

227
00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:42.321
<v Speaker 3>stress,</v>

228
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:43.580
<v Speaker 3>infectious illness prevention,</v>

229
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.870
<v Speaker 3>even juvenile delinquency.</v>

230
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.890
<v Speaker 3>So it's not as cut and dry as we would like you to think that said,</v>

231
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

232
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.480
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the reasons why on it doesn't sell synthetic vitamins and,</v>

233
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.373
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

234
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.750
<v Speaker 3>bound up capsules that are,</v>

235
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.480
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times they find those hard pills in the bottom of fucking</v>

236
00:07:59.481 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 3>port-a-potties cause people shit right through them.</v>

237
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.510
<v Speaker 3>They don't even,</v>

238
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.240
<v Speaker 3>they go through your body like corn because your body's like,</v>

239
00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 3>what does this rock you're eating?</v>

240
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.260
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to eat a rock dummy.</v>

241
00:08:08.261 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 3>He switched he kale.</v>

242
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:09.681
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

243
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:10.910
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to eat cucumbers,</v>

244
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 3>but if you don't have any camera cucumbers,</v>

245
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.650
<v Speaker 3>that rock is better than nothing.</v>

246
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Does what I'm trying to say.</v>

247
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:17.900
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

248
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:18.160
<v Speaker 3>ladies,</v>

249
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.580
<v Speaker 3>gentlemen on a.com it's o,</v>

250
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:24.581
<v Speaker 3>n n I t used the code name Rogan and save 10% off any and all supplements.</v>

251
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:26.271
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

252
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:27.320
<v Speaker 3>we don't have any multivitamins,</v>

253
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.790
<v Speaker 3>but you should read this study and then also read the [inaudible] dot com blog</v>

254
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:32.271
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

255

<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

257
00:08:33.041 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 3>it's a pretty fascinating and it's pretty fascinating how irresponsible it is to</v>

258
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 3>just say something doesn't work when you're talking about three very specific</v>

259
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:42.920
<v Speaker 3>examples where it didn't show a statistical improvement.</v>

260
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

261
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:45.351
<v Speaker 3>O n,</v>

262
00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:47.300
<v Speaker 3>n I t use code name rogue and save yourself some money.</v>

263
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:49.010
<v Speaker 3>Shane Smith and Eddie Wong are here.</v>

264
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.023
<v Speaker 3>Keith music,</v>

265
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 4>the Joe Rogan experience,</v>

266
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.280
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan podcast all day.</v>

267
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.880
<v Speaker 4>I barely know enough about those words that I said to put them in a sentence in.</v>

268
00:09:03.881 --> 00:09:04.590
<v Speaker 4>There it goes.</v>

269
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 4>That's how easy it is to get on the Internet these days.</v>

270
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 4>All that shit that I would say in about vitamins,</v>

271
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:10.014
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

272

275
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:16.860
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

277
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.103
<v Speaker 4>Do you really</v>

278
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.720
<v Speaker 4>love probiotic?</v>

279
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 2>We had spleens so that we could eat rocks.</v>

280
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:29.310
<v Speaker 2>Rocks.</v>

281
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 2>Is that for eating rocks,</v>

282
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.450
<v Speaker 2>bones really wigs things.</v>

283
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Before I thought it was just to get ruptured.</v>

284
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 2>When you play football,</v>

285
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.540
<v Speaker 2>like a little airbag I respect to due to eat rocks.</v>

286
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

287
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Well we got lots of shifts where we used to eat lotion,</v>

288
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.010
<v Speaker 2>dirt.</v>

289
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:44.401
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

290
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 2>Well it wasn't that one of the rumors of the appendix.</v>

291
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if that was ever been proven or disproven,</v>

292
00:09:49.561 --> 00:09:51.360
<v Speaker 2>but the appendix a,</v>

293
00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:53.700
<v Speaker 2>it originally was an Oregon for processing meat.</v>

294
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:54.301
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

295
00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:56.540
<v Speaker 2>Then it was found to be more um,</v>

296
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:56.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

297
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.490
<v Speaker 2>fibrous vegetables that that was what we had the issue until we made me.</v>

298
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.360
<v Speaker 2>You're saying appendix,</v>

299
00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying spleen,</v>

300
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's something else altogether.</v>

301
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.930
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we're not doctors.</v>

302
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.690
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what the fuck we're talking about.</v>

303
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:10.441
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

304
00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 2>You can't be a renegade journalist world traveler.</v>

305
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:13.944
<v Speaker 2>And a doctor,</v>

306
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:14.880
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

307
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.110
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough time in this world.</v>

308
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 2>And Tell Him Eddie Times,</v>

309
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:21.271
<v Speaker 2>Jay Shit together,</v>

310
00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:22.104
<v Speaker 2>son,</v>

311
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.230
<v Speaker 2>you're back from a another crazy vice world tour.</v>

312
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.633
<v Speaker 2>Where'd you go?</v>

313
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:27.483
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

314
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.000
<v Speaker 5>I went to a lot of places we were shooting in Louisiana.</v>

315
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.020
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

316
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.340
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't sound very dangerous,</v>

317
00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.980
<v Speaker 5>but I've been in Louisiana has a heavy story,</v>

318
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.270
<v Speaker 5>Louisiana's pretty gangster.</v>

319
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.010
<v Speaker 5>And then we went to Turkey,</v>

320
00:10:39.011 --> 00:10:39.970
<v Speaker 5>Syria,</v>

321
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.850
<v Speaker 5>Dagestan and Greenland,</v>

322
00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.410
<v Speaker 5>and then Dublin.</v>

323
00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:45.221
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

324
00:10:45.221 --> 00:10:46.420
<v Speaker 5>What'd you do in Greenland?</v>

325
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:52.230
<v Speaker 5>We were there with the Danish and Greenland Meteorological Society as they</v>

326
00:10:54.311 --> 00:10:59.120
<v Speaker 5>measured how fast the ice sheets are melting and there are melting fogging</v>

327
00:10:59.140 --> 00:10:59.950
<v Speaker 5>valve.</v>

328
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:00.783
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

329
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.990
<v Speaker 5>How fast.</v>

330
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.040
<v Speaker 5>Very fast.</v>

331
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.110
<v Speaker 5>So the IPCC report just came out and we are 60 years.</v>

332
00:11:08.111 --> 00:11:10.030
<v Speaker 5>So they do every five years.</v>

333
00:11:10.031 --> 00:11:12.310
<v Speaker 5>They do a report that sort of has a,</v>

334
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:12.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

335
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

336
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:13.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

337
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:14.783
<v Speaker 5>a spectrum of,</v>

338
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:15.221
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

339
00:11:15.221 --> 00:11:19.990
<v Speaker 5>best case and worst case scenario and the worst case scenario from five years</v>

340
00:11:19.991 --> 00:11:20.141
<v Speaker 5>ago,</v>

341
00:11:20.141 --> 00:11:23.160
<v Speaker 5>we're now 30 years ahead of wow.</v>

342
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:23.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

343
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.240
<v Speaker 5>And so this year Greenland had its first full surface melt,</v>

344
00:11:28.241 --> 00:11:32.500
<v Speaker 5>so all of the ice sheet was melting and um,</v>

345
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.230
<v Speaker 5>highest temperatures in recorded history,</v>

346
00:11:35.231 --> 00:11:35.531
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera,</v>

347
00:11:35.531 --> 00:11:36.310
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

348
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.870
<v Speaker 5>And so what it,</v>

349
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.010
<v Speaker 5>Greenland itself holds 23 feet of sea level rise.</v>

350
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.240
<v Speaker 5>So if it melts,</v>

351
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.290
<v Speaker 5>all of it melts.</v>

352
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

353
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.200
<v Speaker 2>there's 27 feet higher,</v>

354
00:11:48.201 --> 00:11:49.460
<v Speaker 2>so we're all going to be underwater.</v>

355
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

356
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Like how deep would that take America?</v>

357
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

358
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:54.820
<v Speaker 5>so it would be,</v>

359
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.670
<v Speaker 5>it would be where the water is now 27 feet higher.</v>

360
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 5>So it would go like the big bear we go.</v>

361
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:01.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

362
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.710
<v Speaker 5>I mean it would go,</v>

363
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.430
<v Speaker 5>it would go,</v>

364
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.810
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how high we are up here,</v>

365
00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:07.500
<v Speaker 5>but we're probably somewhere on 20 feet higher and see the lawyer should have</v>

366
00:12:07.501 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 5>been maybe so we would go out there and there should be some ocean water.</v>

367
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:11.621
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

368
00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:13.220
<v Speaker 5>But like Shanghai New York,</v>

369
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:14.853
<v Speaker 5>Calcutta,</v>

370
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.430
<v Speaker 5>actually 80 of the hundred biggest cities are at sea level.</v>

371
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.420
<v Speaker 4>Was it you guys that did the piece on Miami about how doomed Miami is?</v>

372
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.943
<v Speaker 4>Maybe</v>

373
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.050
<v Speaker 4>did a piece with Jay to Stevens about global warming?</v>

374
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:29.320
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

375
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:29.860
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

376
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.693
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

377
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.733
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

378
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.580
<v Speaker 4>we were just in the bank,</v>

379
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.020
<v Speaker 4>but know that Greenland's shit when I hear things like that,</v>

380
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.190
<v Speaker 4>and I remember I watched the inconvenient truth high and I lit Ay Ay,</v>

381
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.110
<v Speaker 4>I pissed my pants and I was so,</v>

382
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:45.310
<v Speaker 4>I had a nervous breakdown.</v>

383
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.400
<v Speaker 4>That movie is so scary when you're like eating edibles,</v>

384
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:51.850
<v Speaker 4>but it's also the type of shit that makes me feel like I don't want to have</v>

385
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:52.684
<v Speaker 4>kids,</v>

386
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.490
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

387
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:53.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

388
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.511
<v Speaker 4>But you say that,</v>

389
00:12:54.511 --> 00:12:55.390
<v Speaker 4>but why are you,</v>

390
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.380
<v Speaker 4>how are you right now?</v>

391
00:12:56.381 --> 00:12:57.214
<v Speaker 4>You okay?</v>

392
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:58.403
<v Speaker 4>I'm okay.</v>

393
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.280
<v Speaker 4>I think most people are okay.</v>

394
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.670
<v Speaker 4>I think most people are going to remain okay despite the problems of the world.</v>

395
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.370
<v Speaker 4>I think we're going to figure out a way for most people to remain.</v>

396
00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:07.120
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

397
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:07.841
<v Speaker 4>The idea of,</v>

398
00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:08.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

399
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:08.471
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

400
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:09.550
<v Speaker 4>bringing a kid into the world.</v>

401
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.480
<v Speaker 4>If you're alive,</v>

402
00:13:10.481 --> 00:13:12.340
<v Speaker 4>the kid could be alive and when you're dead,</v>

403
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:13.480
<v Speaker 4>the kids going to be dead too.</v>

404
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.440
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's going to be dead.</v>

405
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:15.970
<v Speaker 4>What if you lived in the Mel Deeves?</v>

406
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:16.870
<v Speaker 4>Would you have kids?</v>

407
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:17.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

408
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.560
<v Speaker 4>well that's shit ain't does that doesn't even exist,</v>

409
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.960
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

410
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

411
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.350
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

412
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:20.681
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

413
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:21.491
<v Speaker 5>they're going away.</v>

414
00:13:21.491 --> 00:13:23.590
<v Speaker 5>But actually I did a piece there too,</v>

415
00:13:23.591 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Speaker 5>but a Greenland is interesting because,</v>

416
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

417
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:27.821
<v Speaker 5>so anyway,</v>

418
00:13:27.821 --> 00:13:28.571
<v Speaker 5>we go to Greenland,</v>

419
00:13:28.571 --> 00:13:29.261
<v Speaker 5>we measured the ice,</v>

420
00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:29.951
<v Speaker 5>the ice is melting,</v>

421
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:30.784
<v Speaker 5>it's very bad.</v>

422
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.200
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

423
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:33.280
<v Speaker 5>and then we sort of said,</v>

424
00:13:33.281 --> 00:13:33.521
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

425
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:34.180
<v Speaker 5>let's get a,</v>

426
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.420
<v Speaker 5>a consensus scientists like a scientist who represents this sort of global</v>

427
00:13:37.421 --> 00:13:39.220
<v Speaker 5>consensus of scientific thought.</v>

428
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.541
<v Speaker 5>And we said,</v>

429
00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:41.374
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

430
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.863
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

431
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.863
<v Speaker 5>what's happening?</v>

432
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:44.933
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

433
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:45.821
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>

434
00:13:45.821 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 5>we have to cut admission.</v>

435
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.190
<v Speaker 5>This is a conservative dude.</v>

436
00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:48.551
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

437
00:13:48.551 --> 00:13:50.380
<v Speaker 5>we have to cut emissions by 80%.</v>

438
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.810
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

439
00:13:52.811 --> 00:13:53.021
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

440
00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:55.090
<v Speaker 5>what if we don't cut emissions by 80% then,</v>

441
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:56.021
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

442
00:13:56.021 --> 00:13:58.420
<v Speaker 5>global warming will continue and then the sea level rise,</v>

443
00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.254
<v Speaker 5>we're continuing to do.</v>

444
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:00.281
<v Speaker 5>And then I said,</v>

445
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:00.640
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

446
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.550
<v Speaker 5>how much of it is manmade?</v>

447
00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.493
<v Speaker 5>100% okay?</v>

448
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.450
<v Speaker 5>And so we can change it.</v>

449
00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:04.961
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>

450
00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:05.151
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

451
00:14:05.151 --> 00:14:05.710
<v Speaker 5>you're right,</v>

452
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.950
<v Speaker 5>Joe.</v>

453
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:06.281
<v Speaker 5>We can,</v>

454
00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:08.260
<v Speaker 5>there's shit we can do to change all this stuff.</v>

455
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.670
<v Speaker 5>But what the interesting I said is,</v>

456
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.381
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

457
00:14:11.381 --> 00:14:11.910
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

458
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.300
<v Speaker 5>so if we stop,</v>

459
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

460
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.160
<v Speaker 5>80% emissions,</v>

461
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.870
<v Speaker 5>how long does it continue?</v>

462
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.380
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

463
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:17.710
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

464
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:18.850
<v Speaker 5>hundreds and hundreds of years,</v>

465
00:14:18.851 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 5>probably a thousand years.</v>

466
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:20.771
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

467
00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:24.610
<v Speaker 5>so global warming continues for a thousand years no matter what happens.</v>

468
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.330
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

469
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:25.660
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

470
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.660
<v Speaker 5>and Greenland's going to Mulligan.</v>

471
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:26.921
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

472
00:14:26.921 --> 00:14:27.820
<v Speaker 5>Greenland's gonna melt.</v>

473
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.010
<v Speaker 5>That's a given it just how fast.</v>

474
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:32.830
<v Speaker 5>So we will have 27 or 24 or whatever it is,</v>

475
00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:33.730
<v Speaker 5>feet of sea level rise.</v>

476
00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:34.540
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>

477
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.710
<v Speaker 5>is it going to be in a hundred years?</v>

478
00:14:35.711 --> 00:14:36.610
<v Speaker 5>Is it going to be 50 years?</v>

479
00:14:36.611 --> 00:14:38.140
<v Speaker 5>Is it going to be in 200 years?</v>

480
00:14:38.141 --> 00:14:39.280
<v Speaker 5>That's the only question now.</v>

481
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.290
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

482
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.400
<v Speaker 4>And so no one anticipated this up until just a few decades ago.</v>

483
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.750
<v Speaker 4>We didn't even know if was fucking sea level rise is so fucking crazy.</v>

484
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.400
<v Speaker 4>We just started burning shit and changing</v>

485
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 5>the gasses that surround the planet and be like,</v>

486
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:55.873
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

487
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.043
<v Speaker 5>don't worry.</v>

488
00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.910
<v Speaker 5>What was the shocking thing is I'm like,</v>

489
00:14:58.911 --> 00:14:59.744
<v Speaker 5>how many?</v>

496
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.070
<v Speaker 5>you hear all this shit about why it's a cyclical thing and it's fine.</v>

497
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:08.240
<v Speaker 5>It's nature is always done this.</v>

498
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:08.750
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

499
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:08.881
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

500
00:15:08.881 --> 00:15:08.981
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

501
00:15:08.981 --> 00:15:09.671
<v Speaker 5>it's 100% man.</v>

502
00:15:09.671 --> 00:15:09.861
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

503
00:15:09.861 --> 00:15:10.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:12.323
<v Speaker 5>and he goes,</v>

508
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.660
<v Speaker 5>if you talk to any scientist,</v>

509
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.980
<v Speaker 5>a real scientist,</v>

510
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.330
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

511
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:17.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

512
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.510
<v Speaker 5>95% of the global scientists are like,</v>

513
00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:21.740
<v Speaker 5>this is why it's happening.</v>

514
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:22.191
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

515
00:15:22.191 --> 00:15:22.261
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

516
00:15:22.261 --> 00:15:23.091
<v Speaker 5>what are the other 5%?</v>

517
00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:23.330
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

518
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.340
<v Speaker 5>they're paid by the fucking oil companies.</v>

519
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:26.960
<v Speaker 5>So what the fuck do you think they're going to say?</v>

520
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:28.340
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

521
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.151
<v Speaker 5>and it's a given.</v>

522
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:29.511
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

523
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:32.630
<v Speaker 5>why the fuck don't more people know this?</v>

524
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:34.040
<v Speaker 5>That's one thing that I don't understand.</v>

525
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.920
<v Speaker 5>And we also did this thing on the drought in Texas on a,</v>

526
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:37.790
<v Speaker 5>on another story.</v>

527
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.140
<v Speaker 5>And everybody's like,</v>

528
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:39.551
<v Speaker 5>we asked,</v>

529
00:15:39.551 --> 00:15:40.580
<v Speaker 5>do you believe in global warming?</v>

530
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:41.091
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

531
00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:42.080
<v Speaker 5>all the cows are dead,</v>

532
00:15:42.081 --> 00:15:42.561
<v Speaker 5>the fucking,</v>

533
00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:43.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

534
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.670
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

535
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.080
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

536
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.441
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

537
00:15:44.441 --> 00:15:44.890
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

538
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:45.411
<v Speaker 5>and they're like,</v>

539
00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:45.800
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>

540
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.730
<v Speaker 5>that's been disproved.</v>

541
00:15:46.731 --> 00:15:47.541
<v Speaker 5>That's been disproved.</v>

542
00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:48.260
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

543
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:48.450
<v Speaker 5>bye.</v>

544
00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:49.283
<v Speaker 5>Who?</v>

545
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:50.443
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>

546
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.473
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>

547
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:51.970
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

548
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:52.200
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

549
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.740
<v Speaker 6>just people just pay the lie.</v>

550
00:15:53.741 --> 00:15:57.610
<v Speaker 6>Like we did a fresh off the boat episode in North Dakota and we were trying to</v>

551
00:15:57.611 --> 00:16:01.270
<v Speaker 6>do stories on fracking and we stayed at a man camp and this was one of the most</v>

552
00:16:01.271 --> 00:16:02.710
<v Speaker 6>bugged out things I ever did.</v>

553
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.570
<v Speaker 6>I stated a man camp for two nights and all the strip clubs in the area had been</v>

554
00:16:07.571 --> 00:16:12.571
<v Speaker 6>shut down by the police cause they had like 150 incidents of violence in these</v>

555
00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:17.711
<v Speaker 6>strip clubs because these dudes are out there by themselves working like 1618</v>

556
00:16:18.491 --> 00:16:21.100
<v Speaker 6>hour shifts and they don't see any women.</v>

557
00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.230
<v Speaker 6>So all there is is fracking sites,</v>

558
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:28.260
<v Speaker 6>man camps and strip clubs and a Walmart Rove to these frack sites.</v>

559
00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:32.800
<v Speaker 6>And we're shooting there and we're trying to talk to people and everyone was</v>

560
00:16:32.801 --> 00:16:33.551
<v Speaker 6>super friendly,</v>

561
00:16:33.551 --> 00:16:33.880
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

562
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.520
<v Speaker 6>Everyone wanted to talk to us to divert us.</v>

563
00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 6>We would be on a fracking site of like,</v>

564
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:38.501
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

565
00:16:38.501 --> 00:16:40.060
<v Speaker 6>let me show you another site that's better.</v>

566
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:40.893
<v Speaker 6>Let me show you.</v>

567
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.270
<v Speaker 6>And they drive us like 10 miles away,</v>

568
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:44.500
<v Speaker 6>30 minutes out,</v>

569
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.540
<v Speaker 6>and then they'd stop the truck,</v>

570
00:16:46.541 --> 00:16:47.760
<v Speaker 6>pull over on the side of the road and be like,</v>

571
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:48.071
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

572
00:16:48.071 --> 00:16:49.840
<v Speaker 6>you know that that side I was going to show you.</v>

573
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:50.930
<v Speaker 6>It's just not here man.</v>

574
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:51.310
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

575
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.180
<v Speaker 6>It's just not here.</v>

576
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.610
<v Speaker 6>You could go back and check that place you were just at.</v>

577
00:16:54.611 --> 00:16:56.650
<v Speaker 6>And then we'd go back and then nobody would talk to us.</v>

578
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.020
<v Speaker 6>So everybody would diverse.</v>

579
00:16:59.021 --> 00:17:02.500
<v Speaker 6>And it happened numerous times over three days in North Dakota.</v>

580
00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:06.520
<v Speaker 6>And we ended up pulling out of that episode because we went to a steak house one</v>

581
00:17:06.521 --> 00:17:09.970
<v Speaker 6>night to talk and hang out and meet the locals.</v>

582
00:17:09.971 --> 00:17:10.511
<v Speaker 6>And they were like,</v>

583
00:17:10.511 --> 00:17:11.344
<v Speaker 6>look man,</v>

584
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.320
<v Speaker 6>the politicians like the people that run this town,</v>

585
00:17:14.321 --> 00:17:14.531
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

586
00:17:14.531 --> 00:17:15.364
<v Speaker 6>you're here.</v>

587
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.630
<v Speaker 6>But you had tried to schedule these interviews with the politicians in this town</v>

588
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:23.200
<v Speaker 6>and the people involved in the business and they told you they would do it,</v>

589
00:17:23.201 --> 00:17:26.410
<v Speaker 6>but they bailed because they just wanted to get you here and then leave you out</v>

590
00:17:26.411 --> 00:17:27.244
<v Speaker 6>to dry.</v>

591
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:31.930
<v Speaker 6>Like we had a interview scheduled with all these people in the town and</v>

592
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.340
<v Speaker 6>literally the day of we got there,</v>

593
00:17:33.341 --> 00:17:35.350
<v Speaker 6>everybody canceled and everybody diverted.</v>

594
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.230
<v Speaker 6>Why did they want you to go and then just leave you out to dry?</v>

595
00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.820
<v Speaker 6>Why didn't they just want to cancel?</v>

596
00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

597
00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.590
<v Speaker 6>I have no idea.</v>

598
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:42.150
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

599
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.730
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

600
00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:45.580
<v Speaker 6>I'm guessing that they figured some,</v>

601
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:49.300
<v Speaker 6>I think some people wanted to talk to us and then once word got out to,</v>

602
00:17:49.301 --> 00:17:49.531
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

603
00:17:49.531 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 6>there's these guys</v>

604
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.270
<v Speaker 4>with cameras in the neighborhood.</v>

605
00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:52.260
<v Speaker 4>It's a small town.</v>

606
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:53.490
<v Speaker 4>The man camp,</v>

607
00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 4>we had to get clearances and once the people that own the man camp,</v>

608
00:17:56.971 --> 00:17:58.290
<v Speaker 4>what is exactly a man camp?</v>

609
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.320
<v Speaker 4>A man camp is literally just rows and rows of trailers on top of gravel and you</v>

610
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:04.920
<v Speaker 4>stay,</v>

611
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.550
<v Speaker 4>it's like if you're like my school got hit by hurricanes before and you have</v>

612
00:18:08.551 --> 00:18:09.510
<v Speaker 4>classes in trailers,</v>

613
00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:13.470
<v Speaker 4>people just live in tray these trailers and they split them up for like three or</v>

614
00:18:13.471 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 4>four guys and it's,</v>

615
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.160
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the most depressing places you could ever,</v>

616
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.370
<v Speaker 5>I think they're wanting to get you out to the,</v>

617
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:24.520
<v Speaker 5>to the invite you out to get you to the man camps cause you're sort of</v>

618
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.181
<v Speaker 5>delicious,</v>

619
00:18:25.181 --> 00:18:27.460
<v Speaker 5>sensitive chip.</v>

620
00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:28.410
<v Speaker 5>This is a</v>

621
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.243
<v Speaker 4>crazy thing.</v>

622
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.230
<v Speaker 4>So I watched those,</v>

623
00:18:31.231 --> 00:18:31.540
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

624
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.840
<v Speaker 4>the documentary on a fracking,</v>

625
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.440
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

626
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:34.860
<v Speaker 4>the what?</v>

627
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:35.760
<v Speaker 4>What the hell is it called?</v>

628
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:36.630
<v Speaker 4>The famous one.</v>

629
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.620
<v Speaker 4>They did two of them.</v>

630
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:38.783
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

631
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:40.650
<v Speaker 4>Some guy named Fox.</v>

632
00:18:40.651 --> 00:18:41.484
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

633
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.960
<v Speaker 4>What is that called again?</v>

634
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:43.860
<v Speaker 4>Gasoline.</v>

635
00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:44.693
<v Speaker 4>Gasoline.</v>

636
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.020
<v Speaker 4>Gasoline.</v>

637
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.040
<v Speaker 4>Gasoline was freaky.</v>

638
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

639
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.870
<v Speaker 4>It's really scary.</v>

640
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:49.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

641
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:49.981
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

642
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:51.960
<v Speaker 4>I heard the Gaslamp got debunked.</v>

643
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.681
<v Speaker 4>So I said,</v>

644
00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:52.921
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

645
00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:54.390
<v Speaker 4>well what's been debunked?</v>

646
00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:55.111
<v Speaker 4>And then I looked at,</v>

647
00:18:55.111 --> 00:18:55.411
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

648
00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:55.741
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

649
00:18:55.741 --> 00:18:58.000
<v Speaker 4>they're kind of nitpick and if you're calling that debunks yeah.</v>

650
00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.370
<v Speaker 4>And then he did gasoline to,</v>

651
00:18:59.420 --> 00:18:59.590
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

652
00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:03.240
<v Speaker 4>Like he might've been off about some of the laws and about protection.</v>

653
00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:03.971
<v Speaker 4>I think he,</v>

654
00:19:03.971 --> 00:19:06.360
<v Speaker 4>he misquoted some laws and statistics,</v>

655
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.290
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

656
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:11.490
<v Speaker 4>what he didn't miss quote is these fucking people who talked about these minds</v>

657
00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:12.300
<v Speaker 4>being drilled.</v>

658
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 4>Then all of a sudden their water lights on fire.</v>

659
00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:15.690
<v Speaker 4>He that that was,</v>

660
00:19:15.691 --> 00:19:16.830
<v Speaker 4>there's no misquoting there</v>

661
00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:17.240
<v Speaker 5>Doug,</v>

662
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:17.841
<v Speaker 5>you're looking at it.</v>

663
00:19:17.841 --> 00:19:18.450
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

664
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.540
<v Speaker 5>But that's what happens is,</v>

665
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.081
<v Speaker 5>is you know,</v>

666
00:19:20.081 --> 00:19:22.030
<v Speaker 5>you'll do something like for example,</v>

667
00:19:22.031 --> 00:19:25.420
<v Speaker 5>I just said re nine is melting and then someone will come back and say there's</v>

668
00:19:25.421 --> 00:19:27.700
<v Speaker 5>more ice on the ice sheet and then there ever has been before,</v>

669
00:19:27.701 --> 00:19:28.210
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

670
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:28.511
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

671
00:19:28.511 --> 00:19:28.841
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

672
00:19:28.841 --> 00:19:33.430
<v Speaker 5>and I bring this up in the doc that every time I do anything on the environment,</v>

673
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.790
<v Speaker 5>you have to be so buttoned up because everybody comes back to you with a bunch</v>

674
00:19:36.791 --> 00:19:37.301
<v Speaker 5>of bullshit.</v>

675
00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:39.970
<v Speaker 5>And what it is is there'll be like,</v>

676
00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:40.451
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

677
00:19:40.451 --> 00:19:40.990
<v Speaker 5>it's winter,</v>

678
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.680
<v Speaker 5>so there's,</v>

679
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:41.921
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

680
00:19:41.921 --> 00:19:45.130
<v Speaker 5>there's an increase in the ice shelf and then there's summer and then the ice</v>

681
00:19:45.131 --> 00:19:46.180
<v Speaker 5>shelf met mounts.</v>

682
00:19:46.181 --> 00:19:48.040
<v Speaker 5>What they do is net ice melt,</v>

683
00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:48.940
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

684
00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.751
<v Speaker 5>That's the whole key.</v>

685
00:19:49.751 --> 00:19:50.584
<v Speaker 5>Is it,</v>

686
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:55.270
<v Speaker 5>the net of the year is melting and it's melting like fucking crazy.</v>

687
00:19:55.271 --> 00:19:57.220
<v Speaker 5>Of course there's some happening in the winter,</v>

688
00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.060
<v Speaker 5>but it's the net ice melt and every time you do anything on the environment,</v>

689
00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.020
<v Speaker 5>everybody's got some fucking crazy stat against whatever.</v>

690
00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:05.853
<v Speaker 5>We did this thing,</v>

691
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:10.810
<v Speaker 5>all the cows dying in Texas because of the drought and the cattle ranches can't</v>

692
00:20:10.811 --> 00:20:11.411
<v Speaker 5>afford the water.</v>

693
00:20:11.411 --> 00:20:12.130
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

694
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.390
<v Speaker 5>Because the water that they do have,</v>

695
00:20:13.391 --> 00:20:17.590
<v Speaker 5>they're selling to the gas industry for fracking because they need water infused</v>

696
00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:18.550
<v Speaker 5>with software to get it out.</v>

697
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:19.980
<v Speaker 5>So you're just like,</v>

698
00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:20.770
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

699
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:23.830
<v Speaker 5>it's what I find shocking about it is,</v>

700
00:20:23.831 --> 00:20:24.041
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

701
00:20:24.041 --> 00:20:24.730
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>

702
00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.160
<v Speaker 5>We've been doing this shit for a long time.</v>

703
00:20:26.161 --> 00:20:27.370
<v Speaker 5>We say no to things,</v>

704
00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.410
<v Speaker 5>but we all live here like the oil guys are going to fucking get fucked to.</v>

705
00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.090
<v Speaker 5>Their kids are going to get fuck too.</v>

706
00:20:34.091 --> 00:20:35.860
<v Speaker 5>Like we are shitting where we eat.</v>

707
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.180
<v Speaker 5>We are fucking ourselves.</v>

708
00:20:37.181 --> 00:20:40.990
<v Speaker 5>And that's what I find insidious because you're just saying we're going to fuck</v>

709
00:20:40.991 --> 00:20:42.310
<v Speaker 5>it up for everybody.</v>

710
00:20:42.311 --> 00:20:42.761
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

711
00:20:42.761 --> 00:20:43.750
<v Speaker 5>we're not just going to fuck it up.</v>

712
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 5>We're going to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to say it isn't even though</v>

713
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.890
<v Speaker 2>we fucking know it it because it's worth doing that for the amount of profit</v>

714
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:51.401
<v Speaker 2>that they can make.</v>

715
00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:53.450
<v Speaker 2>It's Ross Spang spending hundreds of millions of dollars.</v>

716
00:20:53.451 --> 00:20:54.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not the biggest business.</v>

717
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear by the time it affects them?</v>

718
00:20:56.801 --> 00:21:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear about the guy who was the top EPA climate control specialist?</v>

719
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 2>It turned out that he was saying the whole time that he was actually undercover</v>

720
00:21:06.461 --> 00:21:07.720
<v Speaker 2>working for the CIA,</v>

721
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.510
<v Speaker 2>so he didn't do his job with the EPA at all.</v>

722
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.100
<v Speaker 2>He told them that he worked for the CIA and that he had like secret projects and</v>

723
00:21:15.101 --> 00:21:16.000
<v Speaker 2>this was his cover,</v>

724
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:16.990
<v Speaker 2>so they paid him.</v>

725
00:21:16.991 --> 00:21:21.100
<v Speaker 2>He was the highest paid employee from the EPA and he was saying he worked for</v>

726
00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:22.000
<v Speaker 2>the CIA,</v>

727
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.010
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't work for the CIA at all,</v>

728
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.620
<v Speaker 2>so he was just getting all this money to fuck off.</v>

729
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:31.360
<v Speaker 2>So the guy built them at a more than more than $900,000 over the course of 10</v>

730
00:21:31.361 --> 00:21:32.170
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

731
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:36.820
<v Speaker 2>This guy was just basking in cash and this was their top paid climate</v>

732
00:21:36.821 --> 00:21:37.630
<v Speaker 2>specialist.</v>

733
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.800
<v Speaker 2>They're top paid guy was literally a complete fraud.</v>

734
00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:42.880
<v Speaker 2>Well that doesn't,</v>

735
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.080
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't help our or shit.</v>

736
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.133

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:46.991
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

739
00:21:46.991 --> 00:21:47.890
<v Speaker 2>it's not good at all,</v>

740
00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:48.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's like these,</v>

741
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.680
<v Speaker 2>these are the Bozos that are watching over this thing.</v>

742
00:21:50.681 --> 00:21:50.761
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

743
00:21:50.761 --> 00:21:50.881
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

746
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:58.120
<v Speaker 2>least a hall pass from the CIA before they just say,</v>

747
00:21:58.121 --> 00:21:58.451

749
00:22:02.231 --> 00:22:03.370
<v Speaker 2>that worked at the SEC.</v>

750
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Then went to the banks and the people that worked at banks went to the SCC and</v>

751
00:22:06.401 --> 00:22:06.761
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

752
00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:06.941
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:09.671
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

756
00:22:09.671 --> 00:22:10.504
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

757
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:15.070
<v Speaker 2>it's the educational institutions that set the standards and parameters for the</v>

758
00:22:15.071 --> 00:22:17.060
<v Speaker 2>business to be practiced and leave.</v>

759
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.980
<v Speaker 2>There are institutions and get giant cushy jobs at these,</v>

760
00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:24.610
<v Speaker 2>these banks and investment houses and there was all detailed on inside job.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You see.</v>

762
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.331
<v Speaker 7>Brilliant.</v>

763
00:22:26.331 --> 00:22:27.730
<v Speaker 7>There was a documentary on the fall.</v>

764
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.940
<v Speaker 7>Great piece recently.</v>

765
00:22:28.941 --> 00:22:33.941
<v Speaker 7>On the 12 bipartisan senators and Congressmen congresspeople who passed the uh,</v>

766
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.470
<v Speaker 7>big Pharma that the health,</v>

767
00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:38.731
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

768
00:22:38.731 --> 00:22:38.891
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

769
00:22:38.891 --> 00:22:42.260
<v Speaker 7>the pharmaceutical law and of the 12 of them,</v>

770
00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:47.390
<v Speaker 7>12 quit before their term was over and went to work at big Pharma and their</v>

771
00:22:47.391 --> 00:22:49.760
<v Speaker 7>average salary in Congress was like 150 grand.</v>

772
00:22:49.761 --> 00:22:50.600
<v Speaker 7>Their average salary,</v>

773
00:22:50.601 --> 00:22:52.700
<v Speaker 7>average salary when they left with 7.5</v>

774
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ and you're just like,</v>

775
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:57.151
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

776
00:22:57.151 --> 00:22:57.984
<v Speaker 2>that's from,</v>

777
00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:59.290
<v Speaker 2>it's from the town.</v>

778
00:22:59.291 --> 00:23:01.330
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's from the objective.</v>

779
00:23:01.331 --> 00:23:02.350
<v Speaker 2>When they pass those laws,</v>

780
00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:04.150
<v Speaker 2>making a hundred objective,</v>

781
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.430
<v Speaker 2>they were just counting that cash.</v>

782
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Just thinking about that boat,</v>

783
00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.070
<v Speaker 2>drive it in that Porsche convertible.</v>

784
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

785
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:14.020
<v Speaker 2>like winning American</v>

786
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:14.611
<v Speaker 7>can idle.</v>

787
00:23:14.611 --> 00:23:15.600
<v Speaker 7>You know I got elected.</v>

788
00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:16.320
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

789
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.520
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to do a couple,</v>

790
00:23:17.521 --> 00:23:18.810
<v Speaker 7>a couple records,</v>

791
00:23:18.811 --> 00:23:21.140
<v Speaker 7>a under contract and then I'm going to go and fucking</v>

792
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:22.001
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

793
00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:23.110
<v Speaker 2>the standards have been set.</v>

794
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's what's been done.</v>

795
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:25.691
<v Speaker 2>It's been done many,</v>

796
00:23:25.691 --> 00:23:26.231
<v Speaker 2>many times,</v>

797
00:23:26.231 --> 00:23:27.490
<v Speaker 2>so they look at it as an option.</v>

798
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.571
<v Speaker 2>Then not only that,</v>

799
00:23:28.571 --> 00:23:30.340
<v Speaker 2>they look at it as the most profitable option,</v>

800
00:23:30.341 --> 00:23:31.630
<v Speaker 2>which is always the one that everybody jumps.</v>

801
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.890
<v Speaker 2>It's perfectly fine.</v>

802
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:34.960
<v Speaker 2>We're going to become a lobbyist.</v>

803
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.420
<v Speaker 2>It's going to become a thing like almost like a,</v>

804
00:23:37.421 --> 00:23:41.290
<v Speaker 2>like a lawyer that's trying to get a guilty client off and it's like as a,</v>

805
00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:42.760
<v Speaker 2>as a law before a lobbyist,</v>

806
00:23:42.761 --> 00:23:43.511
<v Speaker 2>as an educator,</v>

807
00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:43.811
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

808
00:23:43.811 --> 00:23:48.020
<v Speaker 2>what can I get an intellectually behind and defend,</v>

809
00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:48.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

810
00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:49.280
<v Speaker 2>How much,</v>

811
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.810
<v Speaker 2>how much without being objective at all and just trying to satisfy my own need</v>

812
00:23:53.811 --> 00:23:54.290
<v Speaker 2>for money.</v>

813
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.123
<v Speaker 2>Oh my knee.</v>

814
00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:55.761
<v Speaker 2>If I'm,</v>

815
00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:58.700
<v Speaker 2>if I'm like a multibillion dollar a Pharma Company,</v>

816
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:03.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hire the guy that wrote the law to get what I want done.</v>

817
00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Those conversations take place.</v>

818
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.130
<v Speaker 2>How those conversations take place with someone?</v>

819
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.630
<v Speaker 2>Did they bring you in your office and go,</v>

820
00:24:08.631 --> 00:24:09.464
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

821
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:14.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm this fucking stupid law that tells us that we can't frack.</v>

822
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.490
<v Speaker 2>That's dumb and that's keeping us from making money.</v>

823
00:24:16.491 --> 00:24:18.860
<v Speaker 2>Fuck all those people and their blowed up drinking water.</v>

824
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.020
<v Speaker 2>We need to figure out how to get the fuck in there.</v>

825
00:24:21.021 --> 00:24:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

826
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.010
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

827
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:25.490
<v Speaker 2>they fund their election campaigns on both sides and whoever wins,</v>

828
00:24:25.491 --> 00:24:25.731
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

829
00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:25.881
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

830
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:26.960
<v Speaker 2>I funded your election campaign.</v>

831
00:24:26.961 --> 00:24:27.860
<v Speaker 2>You want a lot more of this?</v>

832
00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:29.120
<v Speaker 2>I want to tons more money.</v>

833
00:24:29.121 --> 00:24:30.140
<v Speaker 2>You want to get elected again?</v>

834
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:30.441
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

835
00:24:30.441 --> 00:24:32.050
<v Speaker 2>you want to sign while I get elected.</v>

836
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Just come over and how is that legal to,</v>

837
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.770
<v Speaker 2>how's it legal to fucking give money to both sides?</v>

838
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.870
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy money whenever you want.</v>

839
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.540
<v Speaker 2>It's just you fucking greedy ass holes.</v>

840
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.090
<v Speaker 2>So it costs a lot of money to get elected.</v>

841
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:44.600
<v Speaker 2>It should,</v>

842
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>

843
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.920
<v Speaker 2>it's so blatant that that's the fact that that's how the system is.</v>

844
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.790
<v Speaker 2>That's the actual system itself that that you know,</v>

845
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.820
<v Speaker 2>the people running things like,</v>

846
00:24:52.821 --> 00:24:53.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

847
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.230
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

848
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.520
<v Speaker 6>The reason why they can do it is because we're one of the most misinformed</v>

849
00:24:57.521 --> 00:24:58.070
<v Speaker 6>generations,</v>

850
00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:02.470
<v Speaker 6>like the information gap between your average reader and then the people making</v>

851
00:25:02.471 --> 00:25:05.410
<v Speaker 6>these laws and the people making the deals is gigantic.</v>

852
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.600
<v Speaker 6>Anything is because too many laws have been passed.</v>

853
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.550
<v Speaker 6>It's just like too much illegal like,</v>

854
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:10.331
<v Speaker 6>well for instance,</v>

855
00:25:10.331 --> 00:25:11.710
<v Speaker 6>like let's say we look at the tax code,</v>

856
00:25:11.711 --> 00:25:14.980
<v Speaker 6>write the tax code is thousands and thousands and thousands of pages,</v>

857
00:25:14.981 --> 00:25:17.320
<v Speaker 6>like for an average citizen to go read that,</v>

858
00:25:17.321 --> 00:25:18.910
<v Speaker 6>there's no way it's incomprehensible.</v>

859
00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:19.360
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

860
00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.200
<v Speaker 6>They just added so many pages in so many complexities so that the average</v>

861
00:25:23.201 --> 00:25:23.621
<v Speaker 6>person,</v>

862
00:25:23.621 --> 00:25:26.680
<v Speaker 6>you know we used to have a duty to overthrow like the social contract,</v>

863
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:27.401
<v Speaker 6>like John Locke,</v>

864
00:25:27.401 --> 00:25:28.750
<v Speaker 6>you go back to the social contract,</v>

865
00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.040
<v Speaker 6>there's a duty to challenge a government and even to the extent overthrow it</v>

866
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.180
<v Speaker 6>when you think that it's not doing justice to,</v>

867
00:25:36.181 --> 00:25:36.670
<v Speaker 6>to the,</v>

868
00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:39.100
<v Speaker 6>to the constitution or whatever your social contract is,</v>

869
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.520
<v Speaker 6>but now the average person really is helpless and paralyzed because let's say</v>

870
00:25:44.951 --> 00:25:46.120
<v Speaker 6>you wanted to understand tech,</v>

871
00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:49.570
<v Speaker 6>you can't even just go understand tax like things are so specialized.</v>

872
00:25:49.571 --> 00:25:52.630
<v Speaker 6>It's like the assembly line has taken over everything.</v>

873
00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:56.810
<v Speaker 6>So we may know one thing like you mean you got comma you got,</v>

874
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.270
<v Speaker 6>I mean I feel like we only can know so much.</v>

875
00:26:01.271 --> 00:26:05.890
<v Speaker 6>There's so much to know and things have become so specialized that it's,</v>

876
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.700
<v Speaker 6>it's very tough to kind of strike back at the empire.</v>

877
00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Do you think though,</v>

878
00:26:11.351 --> 00:26:14.560
<v Speaker 2>that with all this like Edward Snowden type shit and all these leaks that are</v>

879
00:26:14.561 --> 00:26:18.100
<v Speaker 2>coming out over and over again with these connections between politicians and</v>

880
00:26:18.101 --> 00:26:19.130
<v Speaker 2>money and the,</v>

881
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.940
<v Speaker 2>the influence is more transparency,</v>

882
00:26:21.941 --> 00:26:23.890
<v Speaker 2>more things have been exposed now than ever before.</v>

883
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's going to make it more difficult to do?</v>

884
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

885
00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:27.130
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

886
00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:27.970
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody goes,</v>

887
00:26:27.971 --> 00:26:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

888
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.081
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

889
00:26:29.081 --> 00:26:30.040
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows it now.</v>

890
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.320
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole thing is,</v>

891
00:26:31.321 --> 00:26:32.860
<v Speaker 2>is this book just came out of the town.</v>

892
00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:33.521
<v Speaker 2>Everybody goes,</v>

893
00:26:33.521 --> 00:26:33.821
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

894
00:26:33.821 --> 00:26:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Meaning they just accept it.</v>

895
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:35.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

896
00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.240
<v Speaker 2>And I agree.</v>

897
00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:38.223
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

898
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.250
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

899
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:39.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

900
00:26:39.971 --> 00:26:41.100
<v Speaker 2>you do have a,</v>

901
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:41.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

902
00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:42.820
<v Speaker 2>you get the government you deserve.</v>

903
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:43.411
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

904
00:26:43.411 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 2>and right</v>

905
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.870
<v Speaker 5>now we're very complacent and we're just,</v>

906
00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:46.201
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

907
00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:46.271
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

908
00:26:46.271 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

909
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.753
<v Speaker 5>We know it's fun.</v>

910
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.200
<v Speaker 5>Cookies.</v>

911
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:48.530
<v Speaker 5>We know.</v>

912
00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:48.780

<v Speaker 5>we know it's fucked up.</v>

914
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:50.820
<v Speaker 5>We know it doesn't work.</v>

915
00:26:50.821 --> 00:26:51.690
<v Speaker 5>We know it's corrupt.</v>

916
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.801
<v Speaker 5>We know that the,</v>

917
00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:53.161
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

918
00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:53.991
<v Speaker 5>there's good luck there.</v>

919
00:26:53.991 --> 00:26:57.240
<v Speaker 5>They're playing chicken with the country every fucking month saying,</v>

920
00:26:57.241 --> 00:26:57.451
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

921
00:26:57.451 --> 00:26:58.480
<v Speaker 5>we're going to default now or not.</v>

922
00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:59.070
<v Speaker 5>I guess we are.</v>

923
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.221
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

924
00:26:59.221 --> 00:26:59.521
<v Speaker 5>we're not.</v>

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.280
<v Speaker 5>the stock market's going up and down and everything.</v>

928
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.300
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't work.</v>

929
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:04.680
<v Speaker 5>It's broken and everyone goes,</v>

930
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:05.420
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

931
00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.910
<v Speaker 4>and it's the least productive Congress we've ever had.</v>

932
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.600
<v Speaker 4>They've passed the least amount of bills ever in the bills that have passed or</v>

933
00:27:11.601 --> 00:27:12.500
<v Speaker 4>like fluff bills.</v>

934
00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.980
<v Speaker 4>So what else fucking vampires is sitting there sucking money out.</v>

935
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.430
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the other thing is how I like it.</v>

936
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:21.241
<v Speaker 5>Tax Tax,</v>

937
00:27:21.241 --> 00:27:21.541
<v Speaker 5>tax,</v>

938
00:27:21.541 --> 00:27:22.021
<v Speaker 5>tax tax.</v>

939
00:27:22.021 --> 00:27:22.950
<v Speaker 5>And what are they doing with it?</v>

940
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.290
<v Speaker 5>They're just fighting their own little fucking bottles in Washington.</v>

941
00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:25.930
<v Speaker 4>No lie.</v>

942
00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.090
<v Speaker 4>I think to answer those for people like you and Shane to run,</v>

943
00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.180
<v Speaker 4>no lie,</v>

944
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:31.880
<v Speaker 4>no lie.</v>

945
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.940
<v Speaker 4>Because like why not though?</v>

946
00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:34.220
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

947
00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.320
<v Speaker 4>The answers the aliens.</v>

948
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.183
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever see</v>

949
00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:41.750
<v Speaker 5>discussion one time when one of our drunken ones as opposed to now,</v>

950
00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.173
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

951
00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:44.480
<v Speaker 5>when we said,</v>

952
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:44.841
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

953
00:27:44.841 --> 00:27:45.501
<v Speaker 5>when you run,</v>

954
00:27:45.501 --> 00:27:46.510
<v Speaker 5>when they,</v>

955
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.810
<v Speaker 5>they get everything.</v>

956
00:27:47.811 --> 00:27:49.100
<v Speaker 5>Anything you've ever done.</v>

957
00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.680
<v Speaker 5>Do you want to talk about 3000 page tax code?</v>

958
00:27:51.681 --> 00:27:52.370
<v Speaker 5>My,</v>

959
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.750
<v Speaker 5>everything bad I've ever done,</v>

960
00:27:53.751 --> 00:27:55.580
<v Speaker 5>but 30,000 pages of Shit.</v>

961
00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.430
<v Speaker 5>That's why like you have to be like Mitt Romney who never did anything.</v>

962
00:27:58.431 --> 00:27:58.850
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

963
00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:03.170
<v Speaker 5>I don't want Mitt Romney to run the crunchy because he's done nothing wrong</v>

964
00:28:03.171 --> 00:28:04.700
<v Speaker 5>cause nobody's done nothing wrong.</v>

965
00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.000
<v Speaker 5>Everybody does bad shit everyday.</v>

966
00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:07.923
<v Speaker 5>Like you know,</v>

967
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:10.210
<v Speaker 5>so having somebody you know,</v>

968
00:28:10.211 --> 00:28:11.001
<v Speaker 5>well I dunno,</v>

969
00:28:11.001 --> 00:28:12.080
<v Speaker 5>maybe he kills kittens.</v>

970
00:28:12.081 --> 00:28:12.381
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

971
00:28:12.381 --> 00:28:13.370
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

972
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.233
<v Speaker 5>generally,</v>

973
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.580
<v Speaker 5>but to me that's what's abnormal.</v>

974
00:28:16.581 --> 00:28:19.280
<v Speaker 5>What's abnormal is never having done anything bad.</v>

975
00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.091
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

976
00:28:20.091 --> 00:28:20.990
<v Speaker 5>that's not human.</v>

977
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.990
<v Speaker 5>I think everyone's bullshit's going to be exposed one day.</v>

978
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.090
<v Speaker 4>I think one day,</v>

979
00:28:25.091 --> 00:28:26.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean it might be our kids,</v>

980
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.390
<v Speaker 4>the generations growing up right now,</v>

981
00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.700
<v Speaker 4>it might be the only kids that never get to have secrets.</v>

982
00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:35.050
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like we've kept secrets for the longest time and then secrets are</v>

983
00:28:35.051 --> 00:28:37.160
<v Speaker 4>exposed on the Internet and that's very interesting.</v>

984
00:28:37.161 --> 00:28:38.650
<v Speaker 4>There's more transparency now than ever.</v>

985
00:28:38.651 --> 00:28:40.780
<v Speaker 4>I think there's going to be no secrets in the future.</v>

986
00:28:40.781 --> 00:28:42.310
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a backlash against this.</v>

987
00:28:42.311 --> 00:28:43.870
<v Speaker 4>No secret bullshit for sure.</v>

988
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:45.650
<v Speaker 5>Book was like no secrets,</v>

989
00:28:45.651 --> 00:28:46.281
<v Speaker 5>no secrets,</v>

990
00:28:46.281 --> 00:28:48.380
<v Speaker 5>because Zuckerberg never had a girlfriend.</v>

991
00:28:48.381 --> 00:28:48.801
<v Speaker 5>So He's like you.</v>

992
00:28:48.801 --> 00:28:49.880
<v Speaker 5>Everybody wants to know everything.</v>

993
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.460
<v Speaker 5>And then Evan comes along with snapchat and goes,</v>

994
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.650
<v Speaker 5>actually I had girlfriends and many of them,</v>

995
00:28:54.651 --> 00:28:55.484
<v Speaker 5>so uh,</v>

996
00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:00.360
<v Speaker 4>there is to only privacy now and so exposed.</v>

997
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.490
<v Speaker 4>They have an inability to hide,</v>

998
00:29:02.491 --> 00:29:06.030
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's going to be going to change because these politicians</v>

999
00:29:06.031 --> 00:29:06.271
<v Speaker 4>running,</v>

1000
00:29:06.271 --> 00:29:08.130
<v Speaker 4>if you look at like their twitters and they're following,</v>

1001
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:09.690
<v Speaker 4>they don't have nearly as many people as you.</v>

1002
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:11.400
<v Speaker 4>You can use social media.</v>

1003
00:29:11.401 --> 00:29:12.620
<v Speaker 4>I bet you could run and win.</v>

1004
00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:14.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to run and when I don't want to run anything,</v>

1005
00:29:14.911 --> 00:29:15.190
<v Speaker 4>I'll get,</v>

1006
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:16.470
<v Speaker 4>I pay my taxes and hide.</v>

1007
00:29:16.471 --> 00:29:19.440
<v Speaker 4>You got to do it for the source of the top two out of the forest with other</v>

1008
00:29:19.441 --> 00:29:20.274
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

1009
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:21.210
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

1010
00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:23.000
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has their own path in life.</v>

1011
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.020
<v Speaker 4>Everyone has their own path in life.</v>

1012
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:26.790
<v Speaker 4>Rogan,</v>

1013
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.623
<v Speaker 4>nation,</v>

1014
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:28.643
<v Speaker 4>barely</v>

1015
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:30.840
<v Speaker 4>puppet government.</v>

1016
00:29:30.841 --> 00:29:33.990
<v Speaker 4>If I ever did when and anybody ever did listen to me,</v>

1017
00:29:33.991 --> 00:29:36.510
<v Speaker 4>whether it'd be a sorry state of this world,</v>

1018
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.630
<v Speaker 4>a person who is acknowledged to be half retarded.</v>

1019
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.620
<v Speaker 4>I think this Shane is right man.</v>

1020
00:29:41.621 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 4>We deserve</v>

1021
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.130
<v Speaker 3>the government we get and I don't think unless we get involved,</v>

1022
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.600
<v Speaker 3>I wish kids would get involved.</v>

1023
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1024
00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:47.700
<v Speaker 3>it's also,</v>

1025
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.070
<v Speaker 3>I think the entire culture is changing at a pretty rapid rate whether we realize</v>

1026
00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:51.491
<v Speaker 3>it or not.</v>

1027
00:29:51.491 --> 00:29:54.590
<v Speaker 3>I think the Internet over the last 20 years has changed</v>

1028
00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:00.280
<v Speaker 3>so much in such a vast degree from,</v>

1029
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1030
00:30:00.671 --> 00:30:02.440
<v Speaker 3>where we were as a culture then.</v>

1031
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:06.190
<v Speaker 3>I think we're still in the midst of this crazy wave that's washed over us and we</v>

1032
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:07.870
<v Speaker 3>haven't let everything settle down yet.</v>

1033
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.030
<v Speaker 3>100% it's still going to,</v>

1034
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean this isn't good.</v>

1035
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:14.950
<v Speaker 3>I think ultimately we're going to have to figure out a way to vote online and</v>

1036
00:30:14.951 --> 00:30:16.690
<v Speaker 3>when we figure out a way to vote online,</v>

1037
00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:21.850
<v Speaker 3>a least one group is going to set up a way to have a mirror vote that doesn't</v>

1038
00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:22.271
<v Speaker 3>count,</v>

1039
00:30:22.271 --> 00:30:25.510
<v Speaker 3>but allows people to know for a fact that it hasn't been fucked with.</v>

1040
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:30.900
<v Speaker 3>It's really easy to click on two sites to how I vote and then you have like</v>

1041
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.420
<v Speaker 3>pledge to do the true vote as well.</v>

1042
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:38.620
<v Speaker 3>So everybody goes to true vote.com and they set up a thing there so they know</v>

1043
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.660
<v Speaker 3>this is not affiliated with the government,</v>

1044
00:30:40.661 --> 00:30:42.400
<v Speaker 3>it's not affiliated with any corporations.</v>

1045
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:46.510
<v Speaker 3>It's just set up by a nonprofit to only collect votes.</v>

1046
00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:50.200
<v Speaker 3>Then you give everybody's Ip a very specific amount of votes.</v>

1047
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.520
<v Speaker 3>You find out what you know,</v>

1048
00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:52.600
<v Speaker 3>how many people are in the household,</v>

1049
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.730
<v Speaker 3>verify and get everyone to socials.</v>

1050
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.440
<v Speaker 3>Get all in a fucking database,</v>

1051
00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:58.900
<v Speaker 3>and then let's see if the votes real.</v>

1052
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.700
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if the digital vote is real.</v>

1053
00:31:00.701 --> 00:31:03.670
<v Speaker 3>If it's been fucked with and you'd count it to true vote and that way you keep</v>

1054
00:31:03.671 --> 00:31:04.390
<v Speaker 3>them honest.</v>

1055
00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:06.190
<v Speaker 3>You just have a few of these true votes,</v>

1056
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.650
<v Speaker 3>things that are certified by whoever,</v>

1057
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:08.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1058
00:31:08.921 --> 00:31:09.550
<v Speaker 3>whoever,</v>

1059
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:13.240
<v Speaker 3>and we figured out a way to find out what the fuck people really want.</v>

1060
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.640
<v Speaker 3>That will change everything.</v>

1061
00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:20.940
<v Speaker 3>That will fucking change everything that and someone coming along and figuring</v>

1062
00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:26.050
<v Speaker 3>out and organized way to utilize people the same way corporations utilize their</v>

1063
00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:26.790
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1064
00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:27.100
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1065
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.930
<v Speaker 3>there's that money's coming from people.</v>

1066
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.650
<v Speaker 3>It's coming from people that work there that makes sure the corporation</v>

1067
00:31:32.651 --> 00:31:33.580
<v Speaker 3>continues to make money.</v>

1068
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.530
<v Speaker 3>Stockholders behind that,</v>

1069
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:36.730
<v Speaker 3>the people who run it,</v>

1070
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:37.750
<v Speaker 3>it's all people.</v>

1071
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:42.520
<v Speaker 3>If you get a gang of people that believes that you shouldn't be shitting into</v>

1072
00:31:42.521 --> 00:31:44.770
<v Speaker 3>the water wells of South Dakota,</v>

1073
00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.690
<v Speaker 3>north wall of these fucking places where they're fracking.</v>

1074
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.040
<v Speaker 3>If you get everybody to put their money behind that you're,</v>

1075
00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:51.880
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about corporation money,</v>

1076
00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.460
<v Speaker 3>you get a bunch of people to put in five bucks,</v>

1077
00:31:54.461 --> 00:31:55.600
<v Speaker 3>you get a few million of those,</v>

1078
00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:57.460
<v Speaker 3>you got some real fucking money to play.</v>

1079
00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:58.540
<v Speaker 3>I also think thank</v>

1080
00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.170
<v Speaker 5>you have,</v>

1081
00:31:59.170 --> 00:31:59.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1082
00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:00.410
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1083
00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:01.360
<v Speaker 5>as that he was saying,</v>

1084
00:32:01.361 --> 00:32:01.841
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1085
00:32:01.841 --> 00:32:05.070
<v Speaker 5>this generation is completely different than any other generation.</v>

1086
00:32:05.071 --> 00:32:07.630
<v Speaker 5>I want to talk about Gen y and they've come up with this,</v>

1087
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:12.660
<v Speaker 5>the different and the healthy sort of disregard for the political system of the</v>

1088
00:32:12.671 --> 00:32:13.181
<v Speaker 5>media,</v>

1089
00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:13.901
<v Speaker 5>for the news,</v>

1090
00:32:13.901 --> 00:32:15.130
<v Speaker 5>for all these things.</v>

1091
00:32:15.131 --> 00:32:15.280
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

1092
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.080
<v Speaker 5>they get there.</v>

1093
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.290
<v Speaker 5>They informed themselves,</v>

1094
00:32:17.291 --> 00:32:18.370
<v Speaker 5>as you were saying in their own way.</v>

1095
00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:22.090
<v Speaker 5>And I think that they're going to work outside of the system a lot and I think</v>

1096
00:32:22.091 --> 00:32:24.070
<v Speaker 5>they're going to use the tools that they grew up with,</v>

1097
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.810
<v Speaker 5>which are these,</v>

1098
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:25.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1099
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:25.950
<v Speaker 5>social media tools,</v>

1100
00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:26.441
<v Speaker 5>tools.</v>

1101
00:32:26.441 --> 00:32:30.120
<v Speaker 5>He's brand new tools to do shit in a way that we can't even fucking imagine.</v>

1102
00:32:30.121 --> 00:32:31.180
<v Speaker 5>And you're already seeing it happening.</v>

1103
00:32:31.181 --> 00:32:34.420
<v Speaker 5>Obviously you see it happening in other places like Arab spring and around the</v>

1104
00:32:34.421 --> 00:32:36.520
<v Speaker 5>world and China and Southeast Asia and China.</v>

1105
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.420
<v Speaker 5>But like,</v>

1106
00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.680
<v Speaker 5>you know when it hits here,</v>

1107
00:32:38.681 --> 00:32:39.070
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1108
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.290
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1109
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:39.990
<v Speaker 5>it's gonna be</v>

1110
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.840
<v Speaker 7>a fucking revolution,</v>

1111
00:32:40.841 --> 00:32:41.440
<v Speaker 7>I hope.</v>

1112
00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:41.741
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:32:41.741 --> 00:32:41.981
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1114
00:32:41.981 --> 00:32:44.770
<v Speaker 6>people are going to get to a point where they realize if they don't do it,</v>

1115
00:32:44.771 --> 00:32:46.090
<v Speaker 6>nobody else is gonna do it for them.</v>

1116
00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.190
<v Speaker 6>Your parents definitely ain't doing that shift for you.</v>

1117
00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:49.310
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

1118
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.440
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

1119
00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.280
<v Speaker 8>My parents' dog,</v>

1120
00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:51.893
<v Speaker 8>my parents,</v>

1121
00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.310
<v Speaker 8>not the Internet.</v>

1122
00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:53.820
<v Speaker 6>Amazing.</v>

1123
00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:57.150
<v Speaker 6>But the Internet is also this amazing tool to distract you from everything that</v>

1124
00:32:57.151 --> 00:32:58.470
<v Speaker 6>you need to do and you need to read.</v>

1125
00:32:58.471 --> 00:32:59.790
<v Speaker 6>Like you have the ability to,</v>

1126
00:32:59.791 --> 00:33:01.770
<v Speaker 6>to jerk off every five minutes if you want to.</v>

1127
00:33:01.771 --> 00:33:02.460
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

1128
00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.510
<v Speaker 8>I don't have that ability.</v>

1129
00:33:03.511 --> 00:33:06.870
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what you're saying and know that I need to get it though.</v>

1130
00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.850
<v Speaker 8>Every five minutes on your own.</v>

1131
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:10.020
<v Speaker 8>You're a God damn rabbit.</v>

1132
00:33:10.021 --> 00:33:10.260
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1133
00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:10.741
<v Speaker 6>Chinese.</v>

1134
00:33:10.741 --> 00:33:11.521
<v Speaker 6>We are rabbits.</v>

1135
00:33:11.521 --> 00:33:12.770
<v Speaker 6>Look how many people we made.</v>

1136
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.860
<v Speaker 8>That's a good point.</v>

1137
00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:15.171
<v Speaker 7>That's a good point,</v>

1138
00:33:15.171 --> 00:33:15.740
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

1139
00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.090
<v Speaker 7>It's a very good point actually.</v>

1140
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.130
<v Speaker 7>But the Chinese and the Indians should have a war.</v>

1141
00:33:19.131 --> 00:33:20.210
<v Speaker 7>So who fucks the most?</v>

1142
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:20.631
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1143
00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:22.010
<v Speaker 7>we could throw a lot of milkshakes.</v>

1144
00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:22.670
<v Speaker 7>Indians,</v>

1145
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:23.121
<v Speaker 7>Indians,</v>

1146
00:33:23.121 --> 00:33:23.451
<v Speaker 7>I think.</v>

1147
00:33:23.451 --> 00:33:24.620
<v Speaker 7>Would Indians win?</v>

1148
00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:24.831
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1149
00:33:24.831 --> 00:33:25.730
<v Speaker 7>they have books on it.</v>

1150
00:33:25.731 --> 00:33:26.280
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1151
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.410
<v Speaker 7>So the Chinese though.</v>

1152
00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:27.941
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1153
00:33:27.941 --> 00:33:28.280
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1154
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:28.461
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

1155
00:33:28.461 --> 00:33:28.611
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1156
00:33:28.611 --> 00:33:29.310
<v Speaker 7>the Indians,</v>

1157
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:31.010
<v Speaker 7>it's a more refined act for them.</v>

1158
00:33:31.011 --> 00:33:31.410
<v Speaker 7>They have,</v>

1159
00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:32.780
<v Speaker 7>they have a method to their madness.</v>

1160
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Speaker 7>Chinese just fucking,</v>

1161
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.301
<v Speaker 7>we just fucking,</v>

1162
00:33:35.301 --> 00:33:35.900
<v Speaker 7>we out there.</v>

1163
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.590
<v Speaker 7>What's so crazy now they're allowing Chinese people in China to have more than</v>

1164
00:33:39.591 --> 00:33:40.150
<v Speaker 7>one baby.</v>

1165
00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:42.610
<v Speaker 7>If they came from single baby households,</v>

1166
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.700
<v Speaker 7>single child households,</v>

1167
00:33:43.701 --> 00:33:44.660
<v Speaker 7>which is kinda interesting.</v>

1168
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.200
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

1169
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.860
<v Speaker 7>Well they have problems there because there's 50 million more men than women.</v>

1170
00:33:48.861 --> 00:33:49.281
<v Speaker 7>So they,</v>

1171
00:33:49.281 --> 00:33:49.761
<v Speaker 7>it's just,</v>

1172
00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:51.290
<v Speaker 7>that is crazy.</v>

1173
00:33:51.291 --> 00:33:52.790
<v Speaker 7>There's also ghost towns they need to fill.</v>

1174
00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:53.570
<v Speaker 7>There you go.</v>

1175
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.781
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1176
00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 7>That's also crazy.</v>

1177
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:55.400
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1178
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:55.850
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1179
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:57.170
<v Speaker 7>Did you guys cover something like that?</v>

1180
00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:58.221
<v Speaker 6>Vice Shane did.</v>

1181
00:33:58.221 --> 00:34:01.490
<v Speaker 6>I was in China for a month this summer to write my second book.</v>

1182
00:34:01.491 --> 00:34:03.500
<v Speaker 6>I was in Chengdu for about three weeks.</v>

1183
00:34:03.501 --> 00:34:06.590
<v Speaker 6>I was in Shanghai for a week and I was in Mongolia for weeks.</v>

1184
00:34:06.591 --> 00:34:08.780
<v Speaker 6>I was just hanging out out there to see and things.</v>

1185
00:34:08.781 --> 00:34:09.091
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty,</v>

1186
00:34:09.091 --> 00:34:09.180
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

1187
00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:09.540
<v Speaker 7>Crazy.</v>

1188
00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:14.320
<v Speaker 7>What is that one town in China that's a replica of another town.</v>

1189
00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:15.150
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of them.</v>

1190
00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.020
<v Speaker 7>There's Paris.</v>

1191
00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:16.740
<v Speaker 7>Really?</v>

1192
00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.210
<v Speaker 7>They have a replica Paris.</v>

1193
00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:20.310
<v Speaker 7>Nobody lives in like U Albany lives.</v>

1194
00:34:20.311 --> 00:34:21.210
<v Speaker 7>They're completely empty.</v>

1195
00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.073
<v Speaker 7>Completely empty.</v>

1196
00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:24.990
<v Speaker 7>3% occupancy.</v>

1197
00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:25.260
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1198
00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:25.900
<v Speaker 7>three.</v>

1199
00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:26.300
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1200
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.270
<v Speaker 7>That must be the weirdest.</v>

1201
00:34:27.271 --> 00:34:27.690
<v Speaker 7>They have.</v>

1202
00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:29.310
<v Speaker 7>They have like a Scandinavia.</v>

1203
00:34:29.311 --> 00:34:30.480
<v Speaker 7>They have a Paris,</v>

1204
00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:34.170
<v Speaker 7>they have like a can of Italian themed one.</v>

1205
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.060
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

1206
00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.000
<v Speaker 7>They're fucking crazy.</v>

1207
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:36.863
<v Speaker 7>The Paris one.</v>

1208
00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:37.500
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1209
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.400
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

1210
00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:39.540
<v Speaker 7>Where did these people get their food?</v>

1211
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.410
<v Speaker 7>That was one of the best episodes on vice.</v>

1212
00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.160
<v Speaker 7>That's so fucking strange.</v>

1213
00:34:44.161 --> 00:34:44.460
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1214
00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.630
<v Speaker 6>The thing is with China,</v>

1215
00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:47.280
<v Speaker 6>it's everything</v>

1216
00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.131
<v Speaker 6>about that country.</v>

1217
00:34:50.131 --> 00:34:54.840
<v Speaker 6>If you go now though is it's at that point in a civilization where the people</v>

1218
00:34:54.841 --> 00:34:56.310
<v Speaker 6>may be able to catch the matrix.</v>

1219
00:34:56.311 --> 00:34:59.640
<v Speaker 6>Like in America there's Snowden and he's great and he's this blip on the radar.</v>

1220
00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:00.990
<v Speaker 6>We had wiki leaks,</v>

1221
00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.690
<v Speaker 6>but as soon as there's one of those guys,</v>

1222
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.190
<v Speaker 6>the government and the Matrix,</v>

1223
00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.030
<v Speaker 6>it adapts so much faster than the people like it can take care of that.</v>

1224
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:09.661
<v Speaker 6>It can.</v>

1225
00:35:09.661 --> 00:35:11.040
<v Speaker 6>So I don't know about that.</v>

1226
00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.600
<v Speaker 7>The government is actually offering him,</v>

1227
00:35:13.601 --> 00:35:17.530
<v Speaker 7>there's this people in the NSA that are offering him immunity if he,</v>

1228
00:35:17.531 --> 00:35:17.801
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1229
00:35:17.801 --> 00:35:20.830
<v Speaker 7>if he returns all the rest of his files because apparently he's was only</v>

1230
00:35:20.831 --> 00:35:23.530
<v Speaker 7>released 1% of the files that he took from the NSA.</v>

1231
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:24.790
<v Speaker 7>Or you're saying the Chinese?</v>

1232
00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:25.330
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1233
00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:26.820
<v Speaker 6>China's interesting to me.</v>

1234
00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:27.780
<v Speaker 6>Like I know what you're saying,</v>

1235
00:35:27.781 --> 00:35:29.580
<v Speaker 6>like snow students and I love Snowden.</v>

1236
00:35:29.581 --> 00:35:32.520
<v Speaker 6>Snowden should have one time person of the year in my opinion,</v>

1237
00:35:32.521 --> 00:35:33.960
<v Speaker 6>he should have fucking one person in the year.</v>

1238
00:35:33.961 --> 00:35:35.160
<v Speaker 6>But China,</v>

1239
00:35:35.161 --> 00:35:39.330
<v Speaker 6>what's interesting is there isn't this stranglehold on the local government.</v>

1240
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:44.250
<v Speaker 6>The local government isn't as strong as it is in America because the tentacles</v>

1241
00:35:44.251 --> 00:35:46.500
<v Speaker 6>of government here are refined.</v>

1242
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.150
<v Speaker 6>Like it really has a grip on us.</v>

1243
00:35:48.151 --> 00:35:50.160
<v Speaker 6>It sees everything in China.</v>

1244
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.340
<v Speaker 6>There is a line of chaos and people can do their own thing.</v>

1245
00:35:53.341 --> 00:35:54.900
<v Speaker 6>Like when you go to a bank in China,</v>

1246
00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:00.060
<v Speaker 6>there are homies in there with just a bag of money and a calculator selling</v>

1247
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.130
<v Speaker 6>currency at a rate below the bank.</v>

1248
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.350
<v Speaker 6>And nobody goes into his business with the bank.</v>

1249
00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.630
<v Speaker 6>So there's a lot of this like kind of wild,</v>

1250
00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:09.120
<v Speaker 6>wild west economics going on out there.</v>

1251
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:13.860
<v Speaker 6>I lived in a super eight motel that a girl rented like a floor of rooms out from</v>

1252
00:36:13.861 --> 00:36:18.510
<v Speaker 6>the super eight decorated them like on some ace hotel shit and then rented them</v>

1253
00:36:18.511 --> 00:36:20.100
<v Speaker 6>out to foreigners and made more money.</v>

1254
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.610
<v Speaker 6>And then there's an office building that's a converted super eight room right</v>

1255
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:24.151
<v Speaker 6>next to me.</v>

1256
00:36:24.151 --> 00:36:26.790
<v Speaker 6>Like there's this weird Kooky stuff going on.</v>

1257
00:36:26.791 --> 00:36:31.200
<v Speaker 6>There's not as much regulation and it's kind of cool to see because there is,</v>

1258
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.210
<v Speaker 6>they don't have the freedom of Internet.</v>

1259
00:36:33.211 --> 00:36:34.920
<v Speaker 6>They don't have that federal freedom like we have,</v>

1260
00:36:34.921 --> 00:36:38.610
<v Speaker 6>but they do have this like local freedom that is very,</v>

1261
00:36:38.611 --> 00:36:39.900
<v Speaker 6>very interesting for me to see.</v>

1262
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.640
<v Speaker 6>Do they have an intranet?</v>

1263
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:43.260
<v Speaker 6>Like an inner Chinese nat?</v>

1264
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:43.830
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1265
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:45.570
<v Speaker 6>China's kind of strategy is,</v>

1266
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:45.961
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

1267
00:36:45.961 --> 00:36:47.520
<v Speaker 6>there's apple everywhere.</v>

1268
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:49.440
<v Speaker 6>We're going to have our own bootleg apple.</v>

1269
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.200
<v Speaker 6>We're going to have our own way ball like bootleg Twitter.</v>

1270
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.480
<v Speaker 6>We have our own telecom businesses,</v>

1271
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.531
<v Speaker 6>their ideas.</v>

1272
00:36:55.531 --> 00:36:57.060
<v Speaker 6>We have this many people.</v>

1273
00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:58.710
<v Speaker 6>If we just keep the money in the country,</v>

1274
00:36:58.711 --> 00:36:59.550
<v Speaker 6>we're going to be fine.</v>

1275
00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:01.260
<v Speaker 6>So that's what they do.</v>

1276
00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:02.820
<v Speaker 6>They have all their own stuff.</v>

1277
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.691
<v Speaker 6>Is it as effective?</v>

1278
00:37:03.691 --> 00:37:04.500
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely not.</v>

1279
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.610
<v Speaker 6>None of it runs as well.</v>

1280
00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.540
<v Speaker 6>We know.</v>

1281
00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.081
<v Speaker 6>No crazy.</v>

1282
00:37:07.081 --> 00:37:07.431
<v Speaker 6>That is it.</v>

1283
00:37:07.431 --> 00:37:10.800
<v Speaker 6>Everything they do is a copy that's so fucking strange.</v>

1284
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.890
<v Speaker 6>They're copying entire cities like down to the,</v>

1285
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.660
<v Speaker 6>the stains on the marble.</v>

1286
00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.600
<v Speaker 6>Why tell Toby America creates things.</v>

1287
00:37:18.601 --> 00:37:21.300
<v Speaker 6>China copies things and then Japan turns them into stuffed animals.</v>

1288
00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.480
<v Speaker 6>It is weird though.</v>

1289
00:37:24.481 --> 00:37:29.481
<v Speaker 6>Like what is it psychologically that makes a culture be responsible for so much</v>

1290
00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:30.900
<v Speaker 6>duplicate?</v>

1291
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.150
<v Speaker 5>It's probably because that's how they,</v>

1292
00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:33.401
<v Speaker 5>they made their money.</v>

1293
00:37:33.401 --> 00:37:34.070
<v Speaker 5>That's the goal.</v>

1294
00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:34.903
<v Speaker 6>Why,</v>

1295
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.750
<v Speaker 6>why,</v>

1296
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:36.071
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

1297
00:37:36.071 --> 00:37:37.130
<v Speaker 6>what caused that?</v>

1298
00:37:37.131 --> 00:37:40.490
<v Speaker 6>What was the trigger that made them not,</v>

1299
00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:43.550
<v Speaker 6>not have anything that they're creating themselves,</v>

1300
00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.890
<v Speaker 6>that they're duplicating so many different things.</v>

1301
00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.720
<v Speaker 6>You don't need to be creative there.</v>

1302
00:37:47.721 --> 00:37:48.260
<v Speaker 6>Cause it's a,</v>

1303
00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:48.740
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1304
00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.180
<v Speaker 6>it stems from a peasant culture,</v>

1305
00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:51.140
<v Speaker 6>peasant revolution.</v>

1306
00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.090
<v Speaker 6>People can't afford the real thing.</v>

1307
00:37:53.091 --> 00:37:54.710
<v Speaker 6>So as a business president,</v>

1308
00:37:54.711 --> 00:37:58.850
<v Speaker 6>all you have to do is create that product at the proper price point in this</v>

1309
00:37:58.851 --> 00:37:59.684
<v Speaker 6>civilization.</v>

1310
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.961
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1311
00:37:59.961 --> 00:38:01.820
<v Speaker 5>because it's manufacturing.</v>

1312
00:38:01.821 --> 00:38:04.610
<v Speaker 5>So basically you would go over there,</v>

1313
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.880
<v Speaker 5>you would give them the IP or the technology or whatever.</v>

1314
00:38:07.881 --> 00:38:10.400
<v Speaker 5>And say make this thing and then they would make it,</v>

1315
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1316
00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:15.050
<v Speaker 5>nine to five and then five to nine they're making the number twos to send tell</v>

1317
00:38:15.051 --> 00:38:17.210
<v Speaker 5>sell to India or Southeast Asia or wherever else.</v>

1318
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.840
<v Speaker 5>So that's what the whole economy is based on.</v>

1319
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:22.310
<v Speaker 5>And then if you look at,</v>

1320
00:38:22.311 --> 00:38:25.700
<v Speaker 5>actually the interesting one is actually pcs because it was like HP,</v>

1321
00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.631
<v Speaker 5>Ibm,</v>

1322
00:38:26.631 --> 00:38:27.380
<v Speaker 5>Dell,</v>

1323
00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:32.380
<v Speaker 5>and we all manufactured them in China and then all of a sudden Lenovo and Acer</v>

1324
00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:35.000
<v Speaker 5>and all these companies became the big,</v>

1325
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:40.280
<v Speaker 5>and it's because the factories just took the technology from like a Dell put it</v>

1326
00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:44.530
<v Speaker 5>out six months before Dow and then at like not for 99 bucks.</v>

1327
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:49.770
<v Speaker 5>And so del couldn't compete with their own factory because they just took the</v>

1328
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.400
<v Speaker 5>shit and sold it for much cheaper.</v>

1329
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.300
<v Speaker 5>So they just took the design and recreated it and just didn't call it a Dell.</v>

1330
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:56.240
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

1331
00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.580
<v Speaker 5>It is kind of smart though.</v>

1332
00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:57.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1333
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.721
<v Speaker 5>it's super scary.</v>

1334
00:38:58.721 --> 00:38:59.111
<v Speaker 5>Smart.</v>

1335
00:38:59.111 --> 00:38:59.381
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1336
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:01.540
<v Speaker 5>If you could just steal people's ideas.</v>

1337
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:02.374
<v Speaker 5>It's smart.</v>

1338
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:03.221
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1339
00:39:03.221 --> 00:39:04.054
<v Speaker 6>it's in a,</v>

1340
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:05.320
<v Speaker 6>I always feel this way.</v>

1341
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:05.980
<v Speaker 6>If,</v>

1342
00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:10.210
<v Speaker 6>if people in China spent as much time trying to create something new as they do</v>

1343
00:39:10.211 --> 00:39:11.020
<v Speaker 6>copying,</v>

1344
00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.790
<v Speaker 6>it'd be probably in a better place.</v>

1345
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:13.450
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1346
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:14.410
<v Speaker 6>Cause they even have like,</v>

1347
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.600
<v Speaker 6>it's an interesting cycle.</v>

1348
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:17.411
<v Speaker 6>Restaurants,</v>

1349
00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:18.760
<v Speaker 6>we cycle oil,</v>

1350
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.270
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1351
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:22.630
<v Speaker 6>there's just so many things they do to get around.</v>

1352
00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:23.261
<v Speaker 6>Like Roman,</v>

1353
00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:25.210
<v Speaker 6>there was that fake lion in the zoo.</v>

1354
00:39:25.211 --> 00:39:27.780
<v Speaker 6>They put the Tibet and dog and the zoo and called it a lion.</v>

1355
00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:28.700
<v Speaker 5>Have you,</v>

1356
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.480
<v Speaker 5>have you ever heard of it?</v>

1357
00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.380
<v Speaker 5>But have you heard the big,</v>

1358
00:39:30.381 --> 00:39:32.990
<v Speaker 5>the big story out of China and out of the fake food story?</v>

1359
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.740
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1360
00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:34.490
<v Speaker 5>Which one?</v>

1361
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:35.241
<v Speaker 5>So you know they,</v>

1362
00:39:35.241 --> 00:39:35.451
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1363
00:39:35.451 --> 00:39:40.160
<v Speaker 5>they keep finding like eggs now that are totally synthetic eggs and they have</v>

1364
00:39:40.161 --> 00:39:40.840
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1365
00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.673
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1366
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:43.890
<v Speaker 5>the pork that they put under the thing and it's good.</v>

1367
00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.380
<v Speaker 5>It was fluorescent blue.</v>

1368
00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:45.711
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1369
00:39:45.711 --> 00:39:46.100
<v Speaker 5>I heard.</v>

1370
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:46.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1371
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:47.810
<v Speaker 5>And then they have the created week.</v>

1372
00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:52.430
<v Speaker 5>Like basically they have a food issue so that they've come up with and I'm like,</v>

1373
00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:52.760
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

1374
00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.121
<v Speaker 5>hold on.</v>

1375
00:39:53.121 --> 00:39:54.530
<v Speaker 5>Eggs aren't fucking expensive.</v>

1376
00:39:54.531 --> 00:39:55.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean you get a chicken lays eggs.</v>

1377
00:39:55.941 --> 00:39:56.774
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1378
00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.910
<v Speaker 5>isn't it more expensive to make a fake egg out of chemicals and make a fake egg</v>

1379
00:40:00.911 --> 00:40:02.990
<v Speaker 5>shell and shit and so much effort,</v>

1380
00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:04.050
<v Speaker 5>effort to shift from a,</v>

1381
00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.780
<v Speaker 5>does it have a fake eggs?</v>

1382
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.010
<v Speaker 5>So why are they doing it then?</v>

1383
00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.780
<v Speaker 5>Cause there's not enough eggs.</v>

1384
00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:09.871
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1385
00:40:09.871 --> 00:40:10.170
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1386
00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:12.360
<v Speaker 3>So they're making some sort of synthetic egg.</v>

1387
00:40:12.361 --> 00:40:13.194
<v Speaker 3>Got a what?</v>

1388
00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:14.443
<v Speaker 5>Chemicals.</v>

1389
00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.340
<v Speaker 5>What kind of drew?</v>

1390
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.110
<v Speaker 5>Look it up online.</v>

1391
00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:16.830
<v Speaker 5>Look up,</v>

1392
00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:19.250
<v Speaker 5>look up a fake Chinese fake food.</v>

1393
00:40:19.251 --> 00:40:20.870
<v Speaker 5>There's all kinds of stories coming out now.</v>

1394
00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1395
00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:23.030
<v Speaker 5>And if you just Google food safety in China,</v>

1396
00:40:23.031 --> 00:40:23.864
<v Speaker 5>it's horrific.</v>

1397
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:25.470
<v Speaker 5>It's fat.</v>

1398
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.910
<v Speaker 5>It's sad.</v>

1399
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.580
<v Speaker 5>I feel bad for the Peter's better fake food scandal.</v>

1400
00:40:28.581 --> 00:40:29.480
<v Speaker 5>Rocks China.</v>

1401
00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.373
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1402
00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:31.723
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1403
00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.370
<v Speaker 6>How to make a rotten egg thing.</v>

1404
00:40:34.371 --> 00:40:36.230
<v Speaker 6>I would tell people those when I read these stories,</v>

1405
00:40:36.231 --> 00:40:36.471
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

1406
00:40:36.471 --> 00:40:38.000
<v Speaker 6>don't judge the people.</v>

1407
00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:39.140
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>

1408
00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:42.560
<v Speaker 6>they're uninformed and they kind of in a lot of ways don't even have a chance</v>

1409
00:40:42.561 --> 00:40:43.080
<v Speaker 6>against this.</v>

1410
00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.200
<v Speaker 6>Like I hung out with the locals there and they're like,</v>

1411
00:40:45.201 --> 00:40:45.381
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

1412
00:40:45.381 --> 00:40:46.550
<v Speaker 6>we know we're eating fake,</v>

1413
00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:46.910
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1414
00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:48.590
<v Speaker 6>We know we're eating recycled oil.</v>

1415
00:40:48.591 --> 00:40:50.540
<v Speaker 6>We know it's going to kill us and it's bad for us.</v>

1416
00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.780
<v Speaker 6>But like we have no choice like their government.</v>

1417
00:40:53.781 --> 00:40:55.730
<v Speaker 6>It's even harder to like effect on a f.</v>

1418
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.030
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1419
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:57.530
<v Speaker 6>you can't affect it on a federal level.</v>

1420
00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.510
<v Speaker 3>Prepare a mold.</v>

1421
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.400
<v Speaker 3>They mix the right amount of resins,</v>

1422
00:41:02.401 --> 00:41:03.030
<v Speaker 3>starch,</v>

1423
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:06.060
<v Speaker 3>coagulant and pigments to make the eggs white.</v>

1424
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.201
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1425
00:41:07.201 --> 00:41:12.201
<v Speaker 3>sodium algernate extracted from brown algae gives the egg white,</v>

1426
00:41:12.511 --> 00:41:14.010
<v Speaker 3>the wanted viscosity.</v>

1427
00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:19.250
<v Speaker 3>Then they add fake egg yolk from a different mix of resin and pigments.</v>

1428
00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.480
<v Speaker 3>Once the proper shape is achieved.</v>

1429
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:27.170
<v Speaker 3>And amalgamate of parafin was gypsum powder and calcium carbonate makes for a</v>

1430
00:41:28.711 --> 00:41:29.640
<v Speaker 3>credible shell.</v>

1431
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.690
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like it's like $100,000.</v>

1432
00:41:31.691 --> 00:41:31.921
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1433
00:41:31.921 --> 00:41:34.650
<v Speaker 5>This is fucking insane.</v>

1434
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:36.350
<v Speaker 2>This is fucking insane.</v>

1435
00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:38.110
<v Speaker 5>There's all kinds of stories.</v>

1436
00:41:38.111 --> 00:41:39.610
<v Speaker 5>Not today have fake eggs.</v>

1437
00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:41.080
<v Speaker 5>They have this crazy,</v>

1438
00:41:41.081 --> 00:41:42.670
<v Speaker 5>you should look up the pork one.</v>

1439
00:41:42.671 --> 00:41:44.740
<v Speaker 5>They have the fake wheat and the wheat is,</v>

1440
00:41:44.741 --> 00:41:45.191
<v Speaker 5>I believe,</v>

1441
00:41:45.191 --> 00:41:46.510
<v Speaker 5>actually poisonous.</v>

1442
00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:47.720
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1443
00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.553
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1444
00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:49.640
<v Speaker 2>This is fun.</v>

1445
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:53.150
<v Speaker 2>Says this and this is all just because they have not enough food.</v>

1446
00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:54.811
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1447
00:41:54.811 --> 00:41:56.130
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's just,</v>

1448
00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:56.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1449
00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:56.821
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1450
00:41:56.821 --> 00:41:58.020
<v Speaker 5>it's again,</v>

1451
00:41:58.021 --> 00:42:00.210
<v Speaker 5>to go back to the hell beautiful human beings are,</v>

1452
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.740
<v Speaker 5>it's a way to make money.</v>

1453
00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:02.041
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1454
00:42:02.041 --> 00:42:02.970
<v Speaker 5>you have a factory,</v>

1455
00:42:02.971 --> 00:42:03.870
<v Speaker 5>you figure out the shit,</v>

1456
00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:07.240
<v Speaker 5>you manufacture millions of these eggs at a paraffin calsl mate,</v>

1457
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:08.700
<v Speaker 5>and you sell it,</v>

1458
00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:14.600
<v Speaker 2>including cases of pork colored to be sold as beef pork that glowed blue</v>

1459
00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:21.020
<v Speaker 2>recycled steam buns and a Tofu fermented with sewage.</v>

1460
00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1461
00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.220
<v Speaker 2>And this is just because there's just no way to sustain that kind of a pocket</v>

1462
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.810
<v Speaker 2>layers.</v>

1463
00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:30.210
<v Speaker 2>There's a lion in front of the zoo.</v>

1464
00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:31.890
<v Speaker 2>That's a real lion,</v>

1465
00:42:31.891 --> 00:42:32.724
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

1466
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.213
<v Speaker 2>No lie.</v>

1467
00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:35.160
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1468
00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Beethoven didn't get a haircut.</v>

1469
00:42:36.731 --> 00:42:37.770
<v Speaker 2>So stupid.</v>

1470
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.180
<v Speaker 2>They called that a lion.</v>

1471
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1472
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.770
<v Speaker 2>What a weird fucking country.</v>

1473
00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.900
<v Speaker 2>And what do they do now?</v>

1474
00:42:45.901 --> 00:42:46.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1475
00:42:46.141 --> 00:42:49.590
<v Speaker 2>they're going to keep growing and they're going to grow with more boys than they</v>

1476
00:42:49.591 --> 00:42:50.424
<v Speaker 2>are girls.</v>

1477
00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:52.560
<v Speaker 2>So if people are going to have kids,</v>

1478
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:57.800
<v Speaker 2>like how the fucker 50 million extra boy's gonna find brides or boyfriends even.</v>

1479
00:42:58.671 --> 00:42:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1480
00:42:58.780 --> 00:42:59.381
<v Speaker 5>But if you,</v>

1481
00:42:59.381 --> 00:43:00.580
<v Speaker 5>if you look at China,</v>

1482
00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:01.850
<v Speaker 5>if you look at China though,</v>

1483
00:43:01.851 --> 00:43:01.990
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1484
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:04.300
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting because when I go to China,</v>

1485
00:43:04.301 --> 00:43:04.931
<v Speaker 5>go to China a lot,</v>

1486
00:43:04.931 --> 00:43:09.070
<v Speaker 5>I think this is what British people must've felt like when they came to America,</v>

1487
00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:12.670
<v Speaker 5>because you would use a tool around America.</v>

1488
00:43:12.671 --> 00:43:13.540
<v Speaker 5>When you're from Britain,</v>

1489
00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.553
<v Speaker 5>it's bigger,</v>

1490
00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:15.910
<v Speaker 5>it's got more people,</v>

1491
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.490
<v Speaker 5>it's got all these factories where they're making tons of shit.</v>

1492
00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.530
<v Speaker 5>And then you go back to England and you're like,</v>

1493
00:43:20.531 --> 00:43:22.240
<v Speaker 5>well we got banking and you know,</v>

1494
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:22.841
<v Speaker 5>you know when we don't,</v>

1495
00:43:22.841 --> 00:43:24.330
<v Speaker 5>we don't really build anything anymore.</v>

1496
00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:25.450
<v Speaker 5>And you could just see it coming.</v>

1497
00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.650
<v Speaker 5>And when you go to China,</v>

1498
00:43:26.651 --> 00:43:27.610
<v Speaker 5>they're just making shit.</v>

1499
00:43:27.611 --> 00:43:31.390
<v Speaker 5>They're making stuff and they're selling stuff and they're building shit,</v>

1500
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.250
<v Speaker 5>jumping off and going crazy.</v>

1501
00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.350
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>

1502
00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:35.080
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

1503
00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:35.913
<v Speaker 5>and they're there,</v>

1504
00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:36.371
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

1505
00:43:36.371 --> 00:43:37.480
<v Speaker 5>three times the size.</v>

1506
00:43:37.481 --> 00:43:38.710
<v Speaker 5>So you sit there and you say,</v>

1507
00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:39.551
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1508
00:43:39.551 --> 00:43:40.840
<v Speaker 5>eventually they're going to get there,</v>

1509
00:43:40.841 --> 00:43:41.441
<v Speaker 5>they're going to win.</v>

1510
00:43:41.441 --> 00:43:43.990
<v Speaker 5>And then we're going to be Great Britain sort of saying,</v>

1511
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:45.160
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1512
00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.420
<v Speaker 5>we're going to be going around going,</v>

1513
00:43:46.421 --> 00:43:49.510
<v Speaker 5>well now we do banking and services and it be like England's nice place and</v>

1514
00:43:49.511 --> 00:43:50.020
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

1515
00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:50.141
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1516
00:43:50.141 --> 00:43:51.550
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to be number one anymore.</v>

1517
00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:56.050
<v Speaker 5>The military part of our number one is the craziest part,</v>

1518
00:43:56.051 --> 00:43:56.740
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>

1519
00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:56.891
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1520
00:43:56.891 --> 00:43:57.640
<v Speaker 5>as far as like,</v>

1521
00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.260
<v Speaker 5>well their military is much bigger,</v>

1522
00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.690
<v Speaker 5>but the thing is is we have the tech,</v>

1523
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.100
<v Speaker 5>but they're going to have the tech soon.</v>

1524
00:44:03.101 --> 00:44:03.934
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1525
00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.440
<v Speaker 5>Because we sell it to them.</v>

1526
00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1527
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:08.430
<v Speaker 2>Of course we sell it to them.</v>

1528
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:11.480
<v Speaker 2>There's also that thing going on at the South China seas though.</v>

1529
00:44:11.481 --> 00:44:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Like definitely Japan fighting primary.</v>

1530
00:44:13.251 --> 00:44:16.160
<v Speaker 2>He wants to militarize like that's scary to what's going on.</v>

1531
00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:16.381
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1532
00:44:16.381 --> 00:44:17.160
<v Speaker 5>But Japan,</v>

1533
00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.130
<v Speaker 5>that's just a bunch of posture because Japan can't fuck with anybody.</v>

1534
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:23.010
<v Speaker 5>I mean like this especially,</v>

1535
00:44:23.011 --> 00:44:25.020
<v Speaker 5>can't fuck with China and no one could fuck with China.</v>

1536
00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1537
00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:27.010
<v Speaker 2>So the South China seas,</v>

1538
00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:31.070
<v Speaker 2>China was telling people if you're going to fly through this zone in the south</v>

1539
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:31.651
<v Speaker 2>China seas,</v>

1540
00:44:31.651 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 2>this is our</v>

1541
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:32.963
<v Speaker 6>territory.</v>

1542
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:36.090
<v Speaker 6>You're going to notify us when we fly through Japan was like,</v>

1543
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.760
<v Speaker 6>we don't concede that that's your territory,</v>

1544
00:44:38.761 --> 00:44:39.690
<v Speaker 6>nor does Korea.</v>

1545
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:42.030
<v Speaker 6>And an America stepped in and was like,</v>

1546
00:44:42.031 --> 00:44:42.331
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1547
00:44:42.331 --> 00:44:45.150
<v Speaker 6>we feel like there needs to be some sort of compromise on this.</v>

1548
00:44:45.151 --> 00:44:45.451
<v Speaker 6>So it's,</v>

1549
00:44:45.451 --> 00:44:47.400
<v Speaker 6>it's a disputed issue right now.</v>

1550
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.850
<v Speaker 6>I think Carrie just went over to Japan to talk to them about the issue.</v>

1551
00:44:50.851 --> 00:44:52.590
<v Speaker 6>But have you been to China,</v>

1552
00:44:52.591 --> 00:44:52.860
<v Speaker 6>Joe?</v>

1553
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:53.460
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1554
00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.350
<v Speaker 6>it honestly is pretty cool.</v>

1555
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.340
<v Speaker 6>You should definitely go.</v>

1556
00:44:56.341 --> 00:44:57.960
<v Speaker 6>The people are amazing.</v>

1557
00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.360
<v Speaker 6>The government is on some other shit.</v>

1558
00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:01.943
<v Speaker 6>The government is awesome.</v>

1559
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:06.000
<v Speaker 6>And the business people that run that country do not give a fuck about humanity.</v>

1560
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.720
<v Speaker 6>That's the problem isn't a case too.</v>

1561
00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:10.440
<v Speaker 6>I mean a,</v>

1562
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.500
<v Speaker 6>I would assume at least that when you get that amount,</v>

1563
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:13.440
<v Speaker 6>that amount of people,</v>

1564
00:45:13.441 --> 00:45:15.810
<v Speaker 6>that it's sort of like a big cities,</v>

1565
00:45:15.811 --> 00:45:16.680
<v Speaker 6>how big cities,</v>

1566
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.400
<v Speaker 6>people are not as valuable to each other as they aren't small towns,</v>

1567
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.150
<v Speaker 6>small towns.</v>

1568
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:23.490
<v Speaker 6>People are a little bit kinder to each other because they're,</v>

1569
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.091
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1570
00:45:24.091 --> 00:45:27.000
<v Speaker 6>they're dealing with a one on one person on a regular basis.</v>

1571
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:28.230
<v Speaker 6>Whereas in big cities,</v>

1572
00:45:28.231 --> 00:45:28.361
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1573
00:45:28.361 --> 00:45:28.490
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

1574
00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:32.400
<v Speaker 6>like I was talking about Jim Norton lives in Manhattan and he jokes around about</v>

1575
00:45:32.401 --> 00:45:36.720
<v Speaker 6>how he lives in this big box filled with people and he doesn't know anybody.</v>

1576
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:39.510
<v Speaker 6>He has an apartment building he lives and he doesn't know a single one of them.</v>

1577
00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.090
<v Speaker 6>And it's like people aren't as valuable.</v>

1578
00:45:42.091 --> 00:45:43.050
<v Speaker 6>They're not worth as much.</v>

1579
00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.870
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if that's the case with a place like China.</v>

1580
00:45:45.871 --> 00:45:48.000
<v Speaker 6>It's just like when you got a billion people that's,</v>

1581
00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:48.661
<v Speaker 6>they're not,</v>

1582
00:45:48.661 --> 00:45:50.340
<v Speaker 6>it's not like a precious resource.</v>

1583
00:45:50.341 --> 00:45:51.810
<v Speaker 6>It's like there's a burden.</v>

1584
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:54.300
<v Speaker 6>The class divide is also so crazy,</v>

1585
00:45:54.301 --> 00:45:57.690
<v Speaker 6>so you don't come into contact with someone of the lower class,</v>

1586
00:45:57.691 --> 00:46:00.090
<v Speaker 6>like the person that you're dumping those goods on you.</v>

1587
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:01.380
<v Speaker 6>You never meet that person.</v>

1588
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:03.030
<v Speaker 6>Like when I lived in Chengdu,</v>

1589
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:05.370
<v Speaker 6>there's less of that divide.</v>

1590
00:46:05.371 --> 00:46:06.330
<v Speaker 6>The divide is still there,</v>

1591
00:46:06.331 --> 00:46:08.220
<v Speaker 6>but you meet people from all walks of life.</v>

1592
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:11.100
<v Speaker 6>Even though that city is becoming one of China's largest,</v>

1593
00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:15.000
<v Speaker 6>those people are in touch because some of them were very poor.</v>

1594
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.650
<v Speaker 6>They open small stores,</v>

1595
00:46:16.651 --> 00:46:17.790
<v Speaker 6>became lower,</v>

1596
00:46:17.791 --> 00:46:19.290
<v Speaker 6>lower middle class in China,</v>

1597
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.210
<v Speaker 6>but they still remember what it was.</v>

1598
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.410
<v Speaker 6>If you go to Shanghai,</v>

1599
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:23.910
<v Speaker 6>it's like if you,</v>

1600
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.510
<v Speaker 6>if I bring up an argument about pollution or humanity or whatever,</v>

1601
00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:28.710
<v Speaker 6>they're really just like,</v>

1602
00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:29.553
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

1603
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:31.200
<v Speaker 6>this place is going to be polluted.</v>

1604
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.060
<v Speaker 6>People are gonna eat fake food.</v>

1605
00:46:33.061 --> 00:46:34.140
<v Speaker 6>People are going to be sick,</v>

1606
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.890
<v Speaker 6>but there's nothing I can do and I'm going to get paid as much as I can until</v>

1607
00:46:37.891 --> 00:46:40.740
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to leave and nobody wants to raise their kids there.</v>

1608
00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:45.750
<v Speaker 6>Everybody knows the environment is not conducive to like raising kids is not</v>

1609
00:46:45.751 --> 00:46:49.190
<v Speaker 6>conducive to living and it's getting worse than life's places.</v>

1610
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.820
<v Speaker 6>Like third instructing pilots on how to land in low visibility from Beijing.</v>

1611
00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.470
<v Speaker 6>If you spend a lot of time in Beijing,</v>

1612
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.550
<v Speaker 6>you never see the sky.</v>

1613
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:57.833
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1614
00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:58.530
<v Speaker 6>Ever.</v>

1615
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:01.350
<v Speaker 6>Ever Yell God damn.</v>

1616
00:47:01.351 --> 00:47:02.610
<v Speaker 6>How bad is after your lungs?</v>

1617
00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:04.440
<v Speaker 6>I'm fairly horrible.</v>

1618
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.921
<v Speaker 6>I mean they do.</v>

1619
00:47:04.921 --> 00:47:06.180
<v Speaker 6>How do you feel when you leave that?</v>

1620
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:07.321
<v Speaker 6>It's tough,</v>

1621
00:47:07.321 --> 00:47:07.591
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1622
00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:08.424
<v Speaker 6>You can tell.</v>

1623
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:10.710
<v Speaker 6>You can tell even the water when you take a shower,</v>

1624
00:47:10.711 --> 00:47:14.310
<v Speaker 6>sometimes it leaves a little like grayness behind.</v>

1625
00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:15.733
<v Speaker 6>It's bad.</v>

1626
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.153
<v Speaker 6>It's bad.</v>

1627
00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.190
<v Speaker 6>Like how Eddie comes on the show and we just bashed China for an hour</v>

1628
00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:23.630
<v Speaker 6>trying to figure out what it costs.</v>

1629
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.160
<v Speaker 6>I just hope to like,</v>

1630
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.720
<v Speaker 6>I mean I don't know how to do it.</v>

1631
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:28.980
<v Speaker 6>I'm writing this book.</v>

1632
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.920
<v Speaker 6>It's really hard to write the book because you want the best for these people</v>

1633
00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:36.880
<v Speaker 6>and the people want like the people know what they're being subjected to,</v>

1634
00:47:36.881 --> 00:47:40.840
<v Speaker 6>but I mean they don't have the freedom to fly around and pick up and move</v>

1635
00:47:40.841 --> 00:47:41.440
<v Speaker 6>somewhere else.</v>

1636
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:41.581
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

1637
00:47:41.581 --> 00:47:42.160
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1638
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.940
<v Speaker 6>they're kind of stuck where they are and they're at the mercy of this</v>

1639
00:47:45.941 --> 00:47:46.451
<v Speaker 6>government,</v>

1640
00:47:46.451 --> 00:47:47.110
<v Speaker 6>this new,</v>

1641
00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:48.970
<v Speaker 6>this new pro chairman.</v>

1642
00:47:48.971 --> 00:47:49.721
<v Speaker 6>I forget what it's called,</v>

1643
00:47:49.721 --> 00:47:50.321
<v Speaker 6>president chairman,</v>

1644
00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:50.561
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

1645
00:47:50.561 --> 00:47:51.394
<v Speaker 6>He's coming in,</v>

1646
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.660
<v Speaker 6>he's doing a good job in terms of the corruption and he's taking down people at</v>

1647
00:47:55.661 --> 00:48:00.040
<v Speaker 6>very high levels that were never exposed to trial or inspection.</v>

1648
00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.120
<v Speaker 6>So that's good.</v>

1649
00:48:01.121 --> 00:48:01.461
<v Speaker 6>But you,</v>

1650
00:48:01.461 --> 00:48:01.620
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1651
00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:03.820
<v Speaker 6>you're just kind of skeptical as to,</v>

1652
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:04.953
<v Speaker 6>is this,</v>

1653
00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.560
<v Speaker 6>is this just for a show or are you just taking down a couple people who don't</v>

1654
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:12.250
<v Speaker 6>matter or are you really gonna go after this and turn this country around?</v>

1655
00:48:12.251 --> 00:48:12.810
<v Speaker 6>So who knows?</v>

1656
00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:13.643
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

1657
00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:14.710
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1658
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:15.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1659
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:15.371
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1660
00:48:15.371 --> 00:48:17.020
<v Speaker 6>I love the country and I loved the people.</v>

1661
00:48:17.021 --> 00:48:18.280
<v Speaker 6>It's just if you go to any,</v>

1662
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:19.960
<v Speaker 6>if you go to any country,</v>

1663
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.490
<v Speaker 6>people are nice.</v>

1664
00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:22.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1665
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:22.930
<v Speaker 5>Or,</v>

1666
00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:23.760
<v Speaker 5>or like you go,</v>

1667
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.950
<v Speaker 5>go to someone's house and they say,</v>

1668
00:48:24.951 --> 00:48:27.960
<v Speaker 5>stay in my house and you need some lamb and you fucking have a beer and they're</v>

1669
00:48:27.961 --> 00:48:28.794
<v Speaker 5>all fine.</v>

1670
00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:30.810
<v Speaker 5>But they could be at war,</v>

1671
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:31.050
<v Speaker 5>but they,</v>

1672
00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:34.050
<v Speaker 5>you go to Afghany Afghany houses,</v>

1673
00:48:34.051 --> 00:48:34.741
<v Speaker 5>they're super nice.</v>

1674
00:48:34.741 --> 00:48:34.831
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

1675
00:48:34.831 --> 00:48:35.700
<v Speaker 5>I was in Dagestan,</v>

1676
00:48:35.701 --> 00:48:37.020
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's super nice to you.</v>

1677
00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:38.790
<v Speaker 5>They want to kill you,</v>

1678
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1679
00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:40.380
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1680
00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.360
<v Speaker 5>philosophically lower like your,</v>

1681
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:43.111
<v Speaker 5>your country,</v>

1682
00:48:43.111 --> 00:48:46.740
<v Speaker 5>like Dagestan is basically a terrorist university,</v>

1683
00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:47.551
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1684
00:48:47.551 --> 00:48:48.384
<v Speaker 5>Because</v>

1685
00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.890
<v Speaker 5>they've been trying to separate from Russia for so long.</v>

1686
00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:53.491
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1687
00:48:53.491 --> 00:48:54.630
<v Speaker 5>there's this war in Chechnya,</v>

1688
00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:56.160
<v Speaker 5>everybody came over to Dagestan.</v>

1689
00:48:56.490 --> 00:49:00.570
<v Speaker 5>So you have this small little country that's continually at war with the</v>

1690
00:49:00.571 --> 00:49:03.330
<v Speaker 5>Russians and the Russians are like sending the special forces,</v>

1691
00:49:03.331 --> 00:49:04.380
<v Speaker 5>the Spetsnaz down,</v>

1692
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:05.011
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1693
00:49:05.011 --> 00:49:05.221
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1694
00:49:05.221 --> 00:49:08.130
<v Speaker 5>and the Spetsnaz guys just kidnap people and cut off their heads.</v>

1695
00:49:08.131 --> 00:49:08.760
<v Speaker 5>And so the,</v>

1696
00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.230
<v Speaker 5>because of this happening and like the,</v>

1697
00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:12.030
<v Speaker 5>the young men go into the forest,</v>

1698
00:49:12.031 --> 00:49:12.864
<v Speaker 5>quote unquote,</v>

1699
00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.700
<v Speaker 5>which is to join the insurgency.</v>

1700
00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:19.830
<v Speaker 5>And there's so many of them that now they're surfacing in Syria and Afghanistan,</v>

1701
00:49:19.831 --> 00:49:20.670
<v Speaker 5>here in America,</v>

1702
00:49:20.671 --> 00:49:21.430
<v Speaker 5>the Boston bombers,</v>

1703
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:26.040
<v Speaker 5>when the older one time and then went to Dagestan for six months before the</v>

1704
00:49:26.041 --> 00:49:26.874
<v Speaker 5>bombing.</v>

1705
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:27.451
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1706
00:49:27.451 --> 00:49:28.284
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1707
00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:28.560
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1708
00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.060
<v Speaker 5>Russia obviously in,</v>

1709
00:49:30.061 --> 00:49:30.271
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

1710
00:49:30.271 --> 00:49:32.220
<v Speaker 5>in Denmark and Czech Republic,</v>

1711
00:49:32.221 --> 00:49:33.970
<v Speaker 5>all these Dagestani terrorists are,</v>

1712
00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:34.111
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>

1713
00:49:34.111 --> 00:49:35.370
<v Speaker 5>are sort of coming out and it,</v>

1714
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:36.061
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1715
00:49:36.061 --> 00:49:36.661
<v Speaker 5>it's because,</v>

1716
00:49:36.661 --> 00:49:36.871
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1717
00:49:36.871 --> 00:49:37.021
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

1718
00:49:37.021 --> 00:49:37.830
<v Speaker 5>they're fighting for,</v>

1719
00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:38.670
<v Speaker 5>for global jihad,</v>

1720
00:49:38.671 --> 00:49:39.630
<v Speaker 5>for Global Sharia.</v>

1721
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:40.301
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1722
00:49:40.301 --> 00:49:40.620
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1723
00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:41.011
<v Speaker 5>and they,</v>

1724
00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:41.401
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1725
00:49:41.401 --> 00:49:41.731
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1726
00:49:41.731 --> 00:49:45.090
<v Speaker 5>it's like a one way ticket to go and they literally go into the forest and learn</v>

1727
00:49:45.091 --> 00:49:48.330
<v Speaker 5>from the best terrorist how to be the best terrorists in the,</v>

1728
00:49:48.331 --> 00:49:48.871
<v Speaker 5>in the world.</v>

1729
00:49:48.871 --> 00:49:49.940
<v Speaker 5>And then they go around the world and,</v>

1730
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:50.180
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1731
00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:51.690
<v Speaker 5>and commit their crimes.</v>

1732
00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:52.950
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1733
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:53.790
<v Speaker 5>but when I was there,</v>

1734
00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:54.001
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1735
00:49:54.001 --> 00:49:55.230
<v Speaker 5>so these people are,</v>

1736
00:49:55.290 --> 00:49:57.870
<v Speaker 5>are theoretically like,</v>

1737
00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:58.681
<v Speaker 5>they hate me,</v>

1738
00:49:58.681 --> 00:49:58.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1739
00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:00.300
<v Speaker 5>cause I'm there with a camera and going,</v>

1740
00:50:00.301 --> 00:50:01.890
<v Speaker 5>where did the Boston bomber go?</v>

1741
00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:02.461
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1742
00:50:02.461 --> 00:50:03.110
<v Speaker 5>and so,</v>

1743
00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:04.590
<v Speaker 5>and so you think they would hate me,</v>

1744
00:50:04.591 --> 00:50:05.041
<v Speaker 5>but they're like,</v>

1745
00:50:05.041 --> 00:50:05.551
<v Speaker 5>come in,</v>

1746
00:50:05.551 --> 00:50:05.821
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1747
00:50:05.821 --> 00:50:06.760
<v Speaker 5>fucking have lamb.</v>

1748
00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.370
<v Speaker 5>Our son was kidnapped,</v>

1749
00:50:08.371 --> 00:50:08.581
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1750
00:50:08.581 --> 00:50:10.470
<v Speaker 5>my daughter became a black widow.</v>

1751
00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:12.230
<v Speaker 5>We want to tell you the story,</v>

1752
00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.110
<v Speaker 5>have some tea,</v>

1753
00:50:13.111 --> 00:50:13.381
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1754
00:50:13.381 --> 00:50:14.550
<v Speaker 5>sit down and we want to tell you,</v>

1755
00:50:14.551 --> 00:50:15.930
<v Speaker 5>we want to tell you want to tell you.</v>

1756
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:20.010
<v Speaker 5>But meanwhile the whole place is basically sort of on this,</v>

1757
00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:21.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1758
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:22.650
<v Speaker 5>civil war,</v>

1759
00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.390
<v Speaker 5>that sort of bubbling.</v>

1760
00:50:24.391 --> 00:50:25.350
<v Speaker 5>And because of that,</v>

1761
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:25.981
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1762
00:50:25.981 --> 00:50:26.950
<v Speaker 5>it's just like you,</v>

1763
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:30.650
<v Speaker 5>all the young men are just learning how to fuck shit up and how to kill people,</v>

1764
00:50:30.651 --> 00:50:31.011
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera,</v>

1765
00:50:31.011 --> 00:50:31.370
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

1766
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.010
<v Speaker 5>Is there anything to it besides just terror?</v>

1767
00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.390
<v Speaker 5>Like when you meet these people?</v>

1768
00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:37.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1769
00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:38.510
<v Speaker 5>I've never met one.</v>

1770
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm just curious like through your eyes,</v>

1771
00:50:40.131 --> 00:50:40.964
<v Speaker 5>what it's like.</v>

1772
00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.670
<v Speaker 5>Are they just like one layer?</v>

1773
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:45.200
<v Speaker 5>It's incredibly simple.</v>

1774
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.580
<v Speaker 5>It's incredibly simple.</v>

1775
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:49.220
<v Speaker 5>We just did a thing called children of the drones.</v>

1776
00:50:49.221 --> 00:50:52.040
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking fascinating if I do say so myself,</v>

1777
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.200
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

1778
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.033
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1779
00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm not supposed to tell him these.</v>

1780
00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.240
<v Speaker 5>We haven't heard them yet.</v>

1781
00:50:56.241 --> 00:50:57.110
<v Speaker 5>But there's two things.</v>

1782
00:50:57.111 --> 00:50:58.340
<v Speaker 5>One was me and down there,</v>

1783
00:50:58.341 --> 00:50:59.360
<v Speaker 5>there was children and the drones,</v>

1784
00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:03.110
<v Speaker 5>what happens is you have a brother or a cousin or whatever,</v>

1785
00:51:03.111 --> 00:51:03.771
<v Speaker 5>your best friend,</v>

1786
00:51:03.771 --> 00:51:04.604
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>

1787
00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:07.520
<v Speaker 5>he just disappeared one day.</v>

1788
00:51:07.521 --> 00:51:08.354
<v Speaker 5>He's just gone.</v>

1789
00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:10.940
<v Speaker 5>And because of the insurgency,</v>

1790
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.160
<v Speaker 5>the special forces can do whatever the fuck they want.</v>

1791
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:15.800
<v Speaker 5>And so they just,</v>

1792
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:16.280
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1793
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.910
<v Speaker 5>you don't look right or you went to this mosque or you have a beard or I just</v>

1794
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:20.331
<v Speaker 5>don't like you,</v>

1795
00:51:20.331 --> 00:51:21.260
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1796
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:22.760
<v Speaker 5>And they kidnap you,</v>

1797
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:23.061
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1798
00:51:23.061 --> 00:51:24.800
<v Speaker 5>And they kill you generally are torture you or whatever.</v>

1799
00:51:24.801 --> 00:51:25.634
<v Speaker 5>You just disappear.</v>

1800
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:28.790
<v Speaker 5>So imagine when you're 19 and you're a hothead and your,</v>

1801
00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:29.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1802
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:32.690
<v Speaker 5>fucking want to fuck shit up whenever and your best friend or your brother or</v>

1803
00:51:32.691 --> 00:51:33.920
<v Speaker 5>your dad or whatever it gets kidnapped,</v>

1804
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:34.850
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are you going to do?</v>

1805
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:36.141
<v Speaker 5>You're going to say,</v>

1806
00:51:36.141 --> 00:51:37.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to fucking fuck shit up.</v>

1807
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:42.230
<v Speaker 5>And then there's a whole bunch of guys who are waiting for you in the forest.</v>

1808
00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:43.401
<v Speaker 5>Where do you go in there?</v>

1809
00:51:43.401 --> 00:51:43.751
<v Speaker 5>And they said,</v>

1810
00:51:43.751 --> 00:51:47.360
<v Speaker 5>here's a gun and I'm going to train you how to build bombs and you're going to</v>

1811
00:51:47.361 --> 00:51:48.810
<v Speaker 5>go fucking low.</v>

1812
00:51:48.811 --> 00:51:50.540
<v Speaker 5>The motherfuckers up who killed your dad.</v>

1813
00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:51.831
<v Speaker 5>And it's just,</v>

1814
00:51:51.831 --> 00:51:52.790
<v Speaker 5>it's very simple.</v>

1815
00:51:52.791 --> 00:51:55.190
<v Speaker 5>Like everyone talks about ideology or it's this or it's,</v>

1816
00:51:55.191 --> 00:51:55.371
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1817
00:51:55.371 --> 00:51:56.630
<v Speaker 5>global tree or all this stuff.</v>

1818
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:58.520
<v Speaker 5>The fact of matter is they just killed your dad.</v>

1819
00:51:58.521 --> 00:51:59.090
<v Speaker 5>So you're going to then,</v>

1820
00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:00.050
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm going to fuck you up.</v>

1821
00:52:00.051 --> 00:52:04.160
<v Speaker 5>And especially in these countries where that's part of the culture.</v>

1822
00:52:04.161 --> 00:52:06.530
<v Speaker 5>Like if you blood on blood for blood,</v>

1823
00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:08.480
<v Speaker 5>same thing with children or the drones.</v>

1824
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.061
<v Speaker 5>You know we,</v>

1825
00:52:09.061 --> 00:52:09.350
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

1826
00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:11.930
<v Speaker 5>we became enamored with drones because there's,</v>

1827
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:14.160
<v Speaker 5>our boys don't get killed and you know,</v>

1828
00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:15.690
<v Speaker 5>we just send them in and they fucking,</v>

1829
00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.050
<v Speaker 5>there's no collateral damage and all this stuff.</v>

1830
00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:22.250
<v Speaker 5>Surgical and of course it's bullshit and you know,</v>

1831
00:52:22.251 --> 00:52:25.190
<v Speaker 5>there's lots of collateral damage and these people know that computers are</v>

1832
00:52:25.191 --> 00:52:28.400
<v Speaker 5>basically killing their brothers and their sisters and their dad and their mom.</v>

1833
00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.380
<v Speaker 5>So we went to Pakistan and we're like,</v>

1834
00:52:30.381 --> 00:52:30.771
<v Speaker 5>why are,</v>

1835
00:52:30.771 --> 00:52:30.981
<v Speaker 5>why,</v>

1836
00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:31.730
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are we going?</v>

1837
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:33.410
<v Speaker 5>Why is everybody joining the Taliban?</v>

1838
00:52:33.411 --> 00:52:34.880
<v Speaker 5>He was more Taliban in Pakistan.</v>

1839
00:52:34.881 --> 00:52:37.670
<v Speaker 5>Then there is in fucking Afghanistan and you know,</v>

1840
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.350
<v Speaker 5>the drones go,</v>

1841
00:52:39.351 --> 00:52:43.040
<v Speaker 5>they kill somebody family and then the Taliban says,</v>

1842
00:52:43.041 --> 00:52:45.980
<v Speaker 5>see these fucking motherfuckers are killing us by remote control.</v>

1843
00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:51.220
<v Speaker 5>And this one woman who runs a school to d Taliban dudes is like for every drone</v>

1844
00:52:52.461 --> 00:52:57.170
<v Speaker 5>attack you have a hundred new recruits to the Taliban and all of those a hundred</v>

1845
00:52:57.171 --> 00:52:57.741
<v Speaker 5>new recruits,</v>

1846
00:52:57.741 --> 00:53:00.650
<v Speaker 5>they will be suicide bombers who will go to America,</v>

1847
00:53:00.651 --> 00:53:04.160
<v Speaker 5>who will go to American troops and we'll fucking blow themselves up every</v>

1848
00:53:04.161 --> 00:53:05.180
<v Speaker 5>fucking drone attack.</v>

1849
00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:06.500
<v Speaker 5>And it's very simple.</v>

1850
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:07.700
<v Speaker 5>You killed my dad,</v>

1851
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:09.170
<v Speaker 5>I am now going to kill you.</v>

1852
00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.280
<v Speaker 5>So this imbalance in terms of warfare,</v>

1853
00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:18.310
<v Speaker 5>there's a yin and a Yang to life and this imbalance is causing this massive</v>

1854
00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:21.830
<v Speaker 5>buildup that one day is kind of slap us in the face.</v>

1855
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:27.130
<v Speaker 5>We are training right now in Dagestan and in Pakistan a hundred alcaide is one.</v>

1856
00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:27.710
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1857
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:32.710
<v Speaker 5>and the irony is we went into Afghanistan 11 years ago to to,</v>

1858
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:33.750
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

1859
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:34.090
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

1860
00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:35.430
<v Speaker 5>to take away the basis,</v>

1861
00:53:35.431 --> 00:53:35.611
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1862
00:53:35.611 --> 00:53:35.801
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

1863
00:53:35.801 --> 00:53:35.971
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

1864
00:53:35.971 --> 00:53:40.971
<v Speaker 5>to get al Qaeda to get Taliban out because of they were giving sanctuary to al</v>

1865
00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:41.370
<v Speaker 5>Qaeda.</v>

1866
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:43.980
<v Speaker 5>And now because of the process that we're doing,</v>

1867
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:46.110
<v Speaker 5>we're making a hundred more al-Qaeda's.</v>

1868
00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:47.751
<v Speaker 5>It's it and,</v>

1869
00:53:47.751 --> 00:53:51.540
<v Speaker 5>and the sort of whole cyclical thing is staggering.</v>

1870
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:53.490
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking bananas,</v>

1871
00:53:53.491 --> 00:53:53.790
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1872
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:55.290
<v Speaker 5>That's such a crazy statistic.</v>

1873
00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:57.600
<v Speaker 5>If you really think about the possibility that that's true.</v>

1874
00:53:57.601 --> 00:54:01.470
<v Speaker 5>100 for every drawing attack and there's a lot of goddamn drone attacks and the</v>

1875
00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:03.810
<v Speaker 5>number of people that are killed that are civilians.</v>

1876
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:04.770
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty high.</v>

1877
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:05.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1878
00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:05.400
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

1879
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.780
<v Speaker 5>this may sound stupid shame,</v>

1880
00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:08.370
<v Speaker 5>but I'm just curious,</v>

1881
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:10.530
<v Speaker 5>is this for these people,</v>

1882
00:54:10.531 --> 00:54:13.020
<v Speaker 5>like it's purely just hate and revenge.</v>

1883
00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:15.030
<v Speaker 5>Like if they somehow came to power,</v>

1884
00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:15.690
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

1885
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:20.460
<v Speaker 5>like what is the objective is that it is the objective just to make other people</v>

1886
00:54:20.461 --> 00:54:23.790
<v Speaker 5>feel the pain that they felt from these drone attacks or,</v>

1887
00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:25.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1888
00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:25.531
<v Speaker 5>well there's,</v>

1889
00:54:25.531 --> 00:54:27.090
<v Speaker 5>there's not trying to give like credibility,</v>

1890
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:28.790
<v Speaker 5>ideological stuff and there's,</v>

1891
00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:29.370
<v Speaker 5>and there's,</v>

1892
00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:30.840
<v Speaker 5>there's philosophy obviously,</v>

1893
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:35.130
<v Speaker 5>but the majority of it is young men by and large.</v>

1894
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:39.480
<v Speaker 5>And now in Dagestan more and more women whose families,</v>

1895
00:54:39.481 --> 00:54:40.051
<v Speaker 5>husbands,</v>

1896
00:54:40.051 --> 00:54:40.500
<v Speaker 5>wives.</v>

1897
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.110
<v Speaker 5>I know if you fucking kidnapped my wife and killed her,</v>

1898
00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:44.130
<v Speaker 5>I would go ape shit.</v>

1899
00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.330
<v Speaker 5>If you kidnap my kids,</v>

1900
00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:50.190
<v Speaker 5>if a computer fucking model airplane killed my children,</v>

1901
00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:52.530
<v Speaker 5>I would blow the fucking shit up.</v>

1902
00:54:52.531 --> 00:54:53.970
<v Speaker 5>I would go fucking ape shit.</v>

1903
00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:58.170
<v Speaker 5>So it's not unnatural for them to do that.</v>

1904
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.801
<v Speaker 5>To say I'm,</v>

1905
00:54:58.801 --> 00:55:01.890
<v Speaker 5>and especially if you're young and you don't have a future and you know a lot of</v>

1906
00:55:01.891 --> 00:55:03.430
<v Speaker 5>them are literate and are told by their rules,</v>

1907
00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:03.871
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

1908
00:55:03.871 --> 00:55:06.030
<v Speaker 5>You're going to go to heaven if you blow yourself up.</v>

1909
00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:06.601
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

1910
00:55:06.601 --> 00:55:08.700
<v Speaker 5>this is a good thing if you go attack these guys.</v>

1911
00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.070
<v Speaker 5>And so it's not like they're going to get in trouble.</v>

1912
00:55:11.071 --> 00:55:14.940
<v Speaker 5>It's not like they're going to go to jail or any of this shit because they're</v>

1913
00:55:14.941 --> 00:55:16.560
<v Speaker 5>going to die and then they're going to go to heaven.</v>

1914
00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:17.910
<v Speaker 5>So there's all that stuff.</v>

1915
00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:19.590
<v Speaker 5>What wrapped up into it too.</v>

1916
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:21.810
<v Speaker 5>What happens when civilians are killed?</v>

1917
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:22.371
<v Speaker 5>When I know,</v>

1918
00:55:22.371 --> 00:55:22.681
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry,</v>

1919
00:55:22.681 --> 00:55:23.041
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>

1920
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:27.660
<v Speaker 5>One other thing is if you had a bunch of Taliban invade America,</v>

1921
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:28.261
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1922
00:55:28.261 --> 00:55:29.270
<v Speaker 5>with long beards and,</v>

1923
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:29.581
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1924
00:55:29.581 --> 00:55:29.871
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1925
00:55:29.871 --> 00:55:31.020
<v Speaker 5>and sort of turbans,</v>

1926
00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:35.430
<v Speaker 5>how many Americans would fight to the death to get those guys out?</v>

1927
00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:35.851
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1928
00:55:35.851 --> 00:55:36.360
<v Speaker 5>we've seen it.</v>

1929
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.590
<v Speaker 5>All we would need is Texas.</v>

1930
00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:39.661
<v Speaker 5>But I'm just saying,</v>

1931
00:55:39.661 --> 00:55:40.980
<v Speaker 5>so you have that alarmed,</v>

1932
00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:44.220
<v Speaker 5>you have that and everyone would fight to the death.</v>

1933
00:55:44.221 --> 00:55:45.210
<v Speaker 5>And so you're like,</v>

1934
00:55:45.211 --> 00:55:45.361
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1935
00:55:45.361 --> 00:55:46.500
<v Speaker 5>that's what they're doing.</v>

1936
00:55:46.501 --> 00:55:47.311
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

1937
00:55:47.311 --> 00:55:48.144
<v Speaker 5>we are.</v>

1938
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.073
<v Speaker 5>We are in,</v>

1939
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:52.140
<v Speaker 5>like we invade them and then occupied their country.</v>

1940
00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:53.281
<v Speaker 5>So they're just saying,</v>

1941
00:55:53.281 --> 00:55:54.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to kill you just for that,</v>

1942
00:55:54.661 --> 00:55:55.690
<v Speaker 5>let alone go to heaven,</v>

1943
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:57.090
<v Speaker 5>let alone the fact that you killed my brother.</v>

1944
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:58.650
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1945
00:55:58.650 --> 00:55:59.250
<v Speaker 5>And there's no,</v>

1946
00:55:59.250 --> 00:55:59.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1947
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:03.030
<v Speaker 5>how do you argue against that if you killed a bunch of people that actually our</v>

1948
00:56:03.031 --> 00:56:03.690
<v Speaker 5>innocence,</v>

1949
00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:07.350
<v Speaker 5>what I was gonna say is what's the process when innocence or killed by drones?</v>

1950
00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:07.801
<v Speaker 5>Is there?</v>

1951
00:56:07.801 --> 00:56:08.461
<v Speaker 5>Apologies.</v>

1952
00:56:08.461 --> 00:56:09.271
<v Speaker 5>Did they get paid?</v>

1953
00:56:09.271 --> 00:56:09.780
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1954
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:10.510
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1955
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.801
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1956
00:56:10.801 --> 00:56:13.470
<v Speaker 5>and the other thing that's interesting about that is,</v>

1957
00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:17.040
<v Speaker 5>so we interviewed the drone pilots and they were like crying and I killed people</v>

1958
00:56:17.041 --> 00:56:18.210
<v Speaker 5>and it fucked me up.</v>

1959
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:19.291
<v Speaker 5>And then you,</v>

1960
00:56:19.291 --> 00:56:20.820
<v Speaker 5>we interviewed the kids and they're crying,</v>

1961
00:56:20.821 --> 00:56:22.700
<v Speaker 5>everybody's crying and so you're,</v>

1962
00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:22.980
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1963
00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:23.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1964
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.710
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1965
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:24.420
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>

1966
00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.350
<v Speaker 5>then we interviewed Taliban kids who,</v>

1967
00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.780
<v Speaker 5>who joined the Taliban and they were like,</v>

1968
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:29.620
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1969
00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.060
<v Speaker 5>there has to be recompense.</v>

1970
00:56:31.061 --> 00:56:33.760
<v Speaker 5>You can't just fucking kill us all the fucking time.</v>

1971
00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.690
<v Speaker 5>And so they joined the Taliban and they're just,</v>

1972
00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:38.050
<v Speaker 5>they will fuck up anything with an American flag.</v>

1973
00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:38.913
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>

1974
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:39.520
<v Speaker 5>and look,</v>

1975
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:39.660
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1976
00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:40.451
<v Speaker 4>I understand.</v>

1977
00:56:40.451 --> 00:56:41.430
<v Speaker 4>I understand it though.</v>

1978
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:42.650
<v Speaker 4>Even if you paid in,</v>

1979
00:56:42.651 --> 00:56:43.451
<v Speaker 4>there's recompense like,</v>

1980
00:56:43.451 --> 00:56:43.631
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1981
00:56:43.631 --> 00:56:44.360
<v Speaker 4>I killed your mom,</v>

1982
00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:45.340
<v Speaker 4>I built you a house.</v>

1983
00:56:45.341 --> 00:56:46.540
<v Speaker 4>Like who the fuck's gonna live in it?</v>

1984
00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:48.123
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1985
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:49.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's anything you can do.</v>

1986
00:56:49.631 --> 00:56:52.740
<v Speaker 4>Like the drone strikes is just actionable.</v>

1987
00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.190
<v Speaker 4>They're totally unconscionable.</v>

1988
00:56:54.191 --> 00:56:58.030
<v Speaker 4>But once there has been casualties and those casualties or ignored,</v>

1989
00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:01.930
<v Speaker 4>that almost seems like a strategy to try to fuel the enemy.</v>

1990
00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:04.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean it really almost seems so short sighted.</v>

1991
00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:04.901
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1992
00:57:04.901 --> 00:57:06.600
<v Speaker 4>we can chalk it off to incompetence,</v>

1993
00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:08.110
<v Speaker 4>which is most likely that.</v>

1994
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:12.490
<v Speaker 4>But if you can't look at the consequences of that in competence and see that</v>

1995
00:57:12.491 --> 00:57:14.430
<v Speaker 4>this is going to cause a bunch of people cheap,</v>

1996
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:16.630
<v Speaker 4>then you don't have to train the pilot.</v>

1997
00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:18.130
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to have a big jet.</v>

1998
00:57:18.131 --> 00:57:18.530
<v Speaker 4>It's just a,</v>

1999
00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:21.560
<v Speaker 4>it's a cheap little drone that has missiles or machine going on wants.</v>

2000
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:24.370
<v Speaker 4>What we see is he can common with everything we've talked about,</v>

2001
00:57:24.371 --> 00:57:25.181
<v Speaker 4>global warming,</v>

2002
00:57:25.181 --> 00:57:25.780
<v Speaker 4>fake food.</v>

2003
00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:29.380
<v Speaker 4>Everybody just wants to pass the bill to the next generation and the next</v>

2004
00:57:29.381 --> 00:57:31.060
<v Speaker 4>generation because they figured,</v>

2005
00:57:31.061 --> 00:57:32.710
<v Speaker 4>well I don't have to deal with these people right now.</v>

2006
00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:33.341
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2007
00:57:33.341 --> 00:57:33.610
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2008
00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:35.350
<v Speaker 5>and also what they don't realize is,</v>

2009
00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:36.071
<v Speaker 5>well fuck it,</v>

2010
00:57:36.071 --> 00:57:37.000
<v Speaker 5>it's in Pakistan.</v>

2011
00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:38.200
<v Speaker 5>They can't come get me here.</v>

2012
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:40.450
<v Speaker 5>And as we've learned from al Qaeda,</v>

2013
00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:42.370
<v Speaker 5>they fucking cat and they will,</v>

2014
00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:45.210
<v Speaker 4>oh Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

2015
00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:46.470
<v Speaker 4>Are there answers Shane?</v>

2016
00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:47.803
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2017
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:48.450
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

2018
00:57:48.450 --> 00:57:49.690
<v Speaker 5>I look it,</v>

2019
00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:51.820
<v Speaker 5>the first thing is to know what the problems are.</v>

2020
00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:53.290
<v Speaker 5>And then once we,</v>

2021
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.600
<v Speaker 5>this is why global warming everything at somebody.</v>

2022
00:57:55.601 --> 00:57:56.590
<v Speaker 5>And even by the way,</v>

2023
00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:58.840
<v Speaker 5>even if global warming isn't true,</v>

2024
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:59.471
<v Speaker 5>which it is,</v>

2025
00:57:59.471 --> 00:58:00.460
<v Speaker 5>but even if it isn't,</v>

2026
00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:01.331
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

2027
00:58:01.331 --> 00:58:04.010
<v Speaker 5>and I say this to the climate change deniers all the time,</v>

2028
00:58:04.011 --> 00:58:04.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2029
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:09.270
<v Speaker 5>even if it's a five fucking percent chance that this is all going to fucking</v>

2030
00:58:10.301 --> 00:58:11.470
<v Speaker 5>fuck up and we're all going to die,</v>

2031
00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:15.820
<v Speaker 5>don't you want to hedge your bets rather than you saying this for sure is not</v>

2032
00:58:15.821 --> 00:58:16.330
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>

2033
00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:17.950
<v Speaker 5>Even if there's a 1% chance,</v>

2034
00:58:17.951 --> 00:58:22.090
<v Speaker 5>don't you want to fucking hedge your bets just as a smart fucking person anyway.</v>

2035
00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:23.560
<v Speaker 5>But first of all,</v>

2036
00:58:23.561 --> 00:58:25.660
<v Speaker 5>you have to say what is the problem?</v>

2037
00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:26.801
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

2038
00:58:26.801 --> 00:58:27.311
<v Speaker 5>as humans,</v>

2039
00:58:27.311 --> 00:58:28.600
<v Speaker 5>we don't want to say what is the problem?</v>

2040
00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:29.680
<v Speaker 5>We have to say what is the problem?</v>

2041
00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 5>And then you can say let's fix it.</v>

2042
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:32.051
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

2043
00:58:32.051 --> 00:58:34.660
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know if I've told this story and you can stop me if I have,</v>

2044
00:58:34.661 --> 00:58:37.720
<v Speaker 5>but one of the most interesting things I did recently is I went to the</v>

2045
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:39.130
<v Speaker 5>Zeitgeists conference,</v>

2046
00:58:39.131 --> 00:58:43.690
<v Speaker 5>which is the Google conference and they had this kid there who's like 18 years</v>

2047
00:58:43.691 --> 00:58:48.691
<v Speaker 5>old and he built the first reactor in his garage when he was like 13 and he came</v>

2048
00:58:49.361 --> 00:58:52.630
<v Speaker 5>up with this way of finding a like radioactive,</v>

2049
00:58:52.631 --> 00:58:53.830
<v Speaker 5>like it's like a Geiger counter,</v>

2050
00:58:53.831 --> 00:58:56.760
<v Speaker 5>but they do it with like a water is the basis of that.</v>

2051
00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.320
<v Speaker 5>So it's so big that they can do like ports.</v>

2052
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:00.750
<v Speaker 5>If they were,</v>

2053
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:01.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2054
00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:02.340
<v Speaker 5>tankers with uh,</v>

2055
00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:06.100
<v Speaker 5>illegal radioactive material they could figure out out in these ports.</v>

2056
00:59:06.101 --> 00:59:07.030
<v Speaker 5>This kid came up with him,</v>

2057
00:59:07.031 --> 00:59:07.864
<v Speaker 5>he was 16,</v>

2058
00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:09.460
<v Speaker 5>his new technology,</v>

2059
00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:09.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2060
00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:10.480
<v Speaker 5>that he was pitching.</v>

2061
00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:13.930
<v Speaker 5>And by the way my jaw was dropping is to take all the,</v>

2062
00:59:13.931 --> 00:59:16.780
<v Speaker 5>spent a radioactive fuel,</v>

2063
00:59:16.781 --> 00:59:16.961
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2064
00:59:16.961 --> 00:59:18.340
<v Speaker 5>the shit that we can't dispose of,</v>

2065
00:59:18.341 --> 00:59:19.930
<v Speaker 5>its got 50,000 year shelf life.</v>

2066
00:59:19.931 --> 00:59:21.800
<v Speaker 5>We can only guarantee safety for a hundred years.</v>

2067
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.710
<v Speaker 5>All the spent fuel from all our reactors.</v>

2068
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:26.810
<v Speaker 5>He's got this technology that,</v>

2069
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:28.640
<v Speaker 5>that he can theoretically,</v>

2070
00:59:28.641 --> 00:59:29.240
<v Speaker 5>and I dunno,</v>

2071
00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:29.361
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2072
00:59:29.361 --> 00:59:29.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2073
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:31.970
<v Speaker 5>I haven't verified this cause I'm not a nuclear physicist,</v>

2074
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:37.360
<v Speaker 5>but he can take that spent fuel power his failsafe reactors that cannot whatever</v>

2075
00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:41.340
<v Speaker 5>be bad down to where they have no uh,</v>

2076
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.490
<v Speaker 5>radiation left in them cause cause the,</v>

2077
00:59:43.491 --> 00:59:44.301
<v Speaker 5>the fuel rods,</v>

2078
00:59:44.301 --> 00:59:45.590
<v Speaker 5>we actually only use like 90,</v>

2079
00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:46.310
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

2080
00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:46.941
<v Speaker 5>7%.</v>

2081
00:59:46.941 --> 00:59:49.340
<v Speaker 5>So there's 93% left in them when we,</v>

2082
00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:50.990
<v Speaker 5>when we put them away and that,</v>

2083
00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.910
<v Speaker 5>so he can take them down to when they're benign and,</v>

2084
00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:56.030
<v Speaker 5>and fuel the world for the next 20,000 years.</v>

2085
00:59:56.031 --> 00:59:56.780
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

2086
00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:57.501
<v Speaker 5>and by the way,</v>

2087
00:59:57.501 --> 00:59:58.130
<v Speaker 5>I believed it,</v>

2088
00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:59.330
<v Speaker 5>but even if it's bullshit,</v>

2089
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.940
<v Speaker 5>like that's the technology we should be going for.</v>

2090
01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:04.550
<v Speaker 5>That's the kind of shit that we should be saying.</v>

2091
01:00:04.551 --> 01:00:05.384
<v Speaker 5>Yes please.</v>

2092
01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:09.650
<v Speaker 5>Let's take all the fucking bad evil shit that we buried in the ground that we</v>

2093
01:00:09.651 --> 01:00:10.880
<v Speaker 5>can't even take that up.</v>

2094
01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:16.130
<v Speaker 5>Power these reactors and have 20,000 years of fucking energy doesn't have it.</v>

2095
01:00:16.131 --> 01:00:17.300
<v Speaker 5>We should pursue the exact,</v>

2096
01:00:17.301 --> 01:00:18.740
<v Speaker 5>how much science has been done.</v>

2097
01:00:18.741 --> 01:00:18.961
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2098
01:00:18.961 --> 01:00:19.281
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

2099
01:00:19.281 --> 01:00:22.300
<v Speaker 5>have you read any of the work that's been done to try to,</v>

2100
01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:22.521
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2101
01:00:22.521 --> 01:00:23.030
<v Speaker 5>so this,</v>

2102
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.391
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

2103
01:00:23.391 --> 01:00:23.840
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

2104
01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.561
<v Speaker 5>he's like the,</v>

2105
01:00:24.561 --> 01:00:25.140
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2106
01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:26.930
<v Speaker 5>the sort of boy phenom of,</v>

2107
01:00:26.931 --> 01:00:27.261
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

2108
01:00:27.261 --> 01:00:28.094
<v Speaker 5>of physics.</v>

2109
01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:30.210
<v Speaker 5>He's backed by the like,</v>

2110
01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:30.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2111
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:31.370
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2112
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:32.600
<v Speaker 5>Bill Gates and,</v>

2113
01:00:32.601 --> 01:00:33.434
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

2114
01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.850
<v Speaker 5>Buffett and uh,</v>

2115
01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:35.840
<v Speaker 5>the Google,</v>

2116
01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:36.920
<v Speaker 5>the Google guys,</v>

2117
01:00:36.921 --> 01:00:37.161
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2118
01:00:37.161 --> 01:00:38.690
<v Speaker 5>he's sort of like a vetted kid.</v>

2119
01:00:38.691 --> 01:00:39.650
<v Speaker 5>He's a famous,</v>

2120
01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:40.371
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2121
01:00:40.371 --> 01:00:41.900
<v Speaker 5>brain about this stuff.</v>

2122
01:00:41.901 --> 01:00:45.110
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure that they're not going to just say come spew bullshit to a bunch</v>

2123
01:00:45.111 --> 01:00:45.651
<v Speaker 5>of fucking,</v>

2124
01:00:45.651 --> 01:00:45.891
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2125
01:00:45.891 --> 01:00:46.700
<v Speaker 5>old people.</v>

2126
01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:47.540
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>

2127
01:00:47.541 --> 01:00:47.781
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2128
01:00:47.781 --> 01:00:49.580
<v Speaker 5>I have not verified it,</v>

2129
01:00:49.581 --> 01:00:50.540
<v Speaker 5>but this is his theory.</v>

2130
01:00:50.541 --> 01:00:52.760
<v Speaker 5>Someone should look them up online or figure it out or whatever.</v>

2131
01:00:52.761 --> 01:00:54.320
<v Speaker 5>But when I heard that,</v>

2132
01:00:54.321 --> 01:00:54.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2133
01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:55.340
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

2134
01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.480
<v Speaker 5>even if it isn't true,</v>

2135
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:59.420
<v Speaker 5>that's the type of shit that we should be going for.</v>

2136
01:00:59.421 --> 01:01:02.540
<v Speaker 5>Because once we realize that if global warming is true,</v>

2137
01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:03.200
<v Speaker 5>which it is,</v>

2138
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.410
<v Speaker 5>if we have to cut carbon emissions by 80% which we can,</v>

2139
01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.690
<v Speaker 5>then you need to have this technology which says,</v>

2140
01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.350
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2141
01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:10.640
<v Speaker 5>all of the fuel is there.</v>

2142
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:11.450
<v Speaker 5>We don't have to,</v>

2143
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:15.320
<v Speaker 5>no one has to pay for energy anymore cause 20,000 years of fuel is in these</v>

2144
01:01:15.321 --> 01:01:18.050
<v Speaker 5>spent reactors that we don't have to pay for it.</v>

2145
01:01:18.051 --> 01:01:18.650
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

2146
01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:21.650
<v Speaker 5>but that Shit's going to get moved to run on trucks that are going to be driven</v>

2147
01:01:21.651 --> 01:01:24.440
<v Speaker 5>by God's on math and they're going to fucking go off the road.</v>

2148
01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.390
<v Speaker 5>That's what the gas companies are going to say.</v>

2149
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:29.730
<v Speaker 5>Cause they're going to want us to take like 50 to a hundred years to institute</v>

2150
01:01:29.731 --> 01:01:30.090
<v Speaker 5>detection.</v>

2151
01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2152
01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:33.170
<v Speaker 2>All the gas companies are going to hire drivers to be on the Mat,</v>

2153
01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:34.840
<v Speaker 2>make sure they crash.</v>

2154
01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:38.410
<v Speaker 2>They're going to give these dudes meth so they hold on a second.</v>

2155
01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:39.310
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

2156
01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:40.720
<v Speaker 2>get away from your doom and gloom.</v>

2157
01:01:40.721 --> 01:01:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't say yes Joe,</v>

2158
01:01:41.651 --> 01:01:42.041
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

2159
01:01:42.041 --> 01:01:43.360
<v Speaker 2>We can fucking be better.</v>

2160
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:44.230
<v Speaker 2>We can be better.</v>

2161
01:01:44.231 --> 01:01:45.370
<v Speaker 2>But it's not this way.</v>

2162
01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Traveling around with fucking truck loads of nuclear waste.</v>

2163
01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2164
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:50.540
<v Speaker 2>We'll bring the machine to the wayside.</v>

2165
01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:51.940
<v Speaker 2>It's not happening.</v>

2166
01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.370
<v Speaker 2>This is a mess.</v>

2167
01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:55.580
<v Speaker 2>This is a goddamn mess.</v>

2168
01:01:55.581 --> 01:01:57.970
<v Speaker 2>They're going to drive nuclear waste through the middle of America.</v>

2169
01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:02.230
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have trucks full of death just rolling through your town 40</v>

2170
01:02:02.231 --> 01:02:03.064
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour.</v>

2171
01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:05.920
<v Speaker 2>The already I already do.</v>

2172
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:08.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've been doing it for 50 fucking years.</v>

2173
01:02:08.021 --> 01:02:08.261
<v Speaker 2>Red.</v>

2176
01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:14.951
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

2177
01:02:14.951 --> 01:02:16.720
<v Speaker 2>He's radiating off and on math.</v>

2178
01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.360
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>

2179

<v Speaker 2>just fucking gun in it through the main street.</v>

2180
01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Ignoring lights like a Stephen King movie.</v>

<v Speaker 9>Bye Bye.</v>

2186
01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:37.170
<v Speaker 2>No s'mores in the balance.</v>

2187
01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.270
<v Speaker 2>You know someone's writing this all down right now.</v>

2188
01:02:39.271 --> 01:02:40.650
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a movie in six months.</v>

2189
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:41.543
<v Speaker 2>I hope that it is.</v>

2190
01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:42.900
<v Speaker 2>I like moving truck.</v>

2191
01:02:42.901 --> 01:02:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Can't extremely dangerous radioactive material found after it was stolen in</v>

2192
01:02:46.621 --> 01:02:47.190
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>

2193
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.701
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2194
01:02:47.701 --> 01:02:48.750
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2195
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:52.470
<v Speaker 2>don't they have like at least one guard?</v>

2196
01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:57.030
<v Speaker 2>You gotta fucking a couple of dudes with machine guns when you're carrying</v>

2197
01:02:57.031 --> 01:03:01.080
<v Speaker 2>around nuclear waste in the back of a truck going to Mexico.</v>

2198
01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2199
01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:06.650
<v Speaker 5>There was a famous story of a bunch of guys in Brazil,</v>

2200
01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:07.760
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2201
01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:12.760
<v Speaker 5>broke into a hospital to steal shit and they stole like a safe for scrap metal.</v>

2202
01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:17.300
<v Speaker 5>And the safe was a where they kept the cesium,</v>

2203
01:03:17.301 --> 01:03:17.751
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

2204
01:03:17.751 --> 01:03:18.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2205
01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:18.850
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2206
01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:19.210
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2207
01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:22.430
<v Speaker 5>it's radioactive material that they use for treating tumors and stuff.</v>

2208
01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:26.200
<v Speaker 5>And they had a high speed chase through the town and uh,</v>

2209
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:27.650
<v Speaker 5>they had sort of cracked open the safe.</v>

2210
01:03:27.651 --> 01:03:31.250
<v Speaker 5>There was all the cesium was sorta this white powder was sort of falling out</v>

2211
01:03:31.251 --> 01:03:32.860
<v Speaker 5>around the town as the,</v>

2212
01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.960
<v Speaker 5>the cops were chasing them and they had to take the whole town brick by brick</v>

2213
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:43.510
<v Speaker 5>and bury it under fucking concrete and led because it radiated the whole fucking</v>

2214
01:03:44.451 --> 01:03:44.661
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2215
01:03:44.661 --> 01:03:45.530
<v Speaker 5>And this is just</v>

2216
01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:46.550
<v Speaker 2>from a hospital.</v>

2217
01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.660
<v Speaker 2>They had to take the whole town apart and bury it under,</v>

2218
01:03:50.661 --> 01:03:51.000
<v Speaker 2>under,</v>

2219
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:51.920
<v Speaker 2>like led and,</v>

2220
01:03:51.921 --> 01:03:53.000
<v Speaker 2>and concrete.</v>

2221
01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:54.980
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>

2222
01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:55.231
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

2223
01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:56.150
<v Speaker 2>my whole thing is</v>

2224
01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:57.403
<v Speaker 5>terrified.</v>

2225
01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:58.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm terrified of that shit,</v>

2226
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.781
<v Speaker 5>but I'm like,</v>

2227
01:03:59.781 --> 01:04:01.970
<v Speaker 5>and I don't believe we know what we're doing with the technology.</v>

2228
01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:02.804
<v Speaker 5>I'm terrified.</v>

2229
01:04:03.050 --> 01:04:04.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm terrified to proliferation.</v>

2230
01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:05.361
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

2231
01:04:05.361 --> 01:04:10.130
<v Speaker 5>if you can take all those spent fucking fuel rods and power the world,</v>

2232
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:12.230
<v Speaker 5>then at least shouldn't we give that a fucking shot?</v>

2233
01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:12.771
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2234
01:04:12.771 --> 01:04:13.940
<v Speaker 2>If we can really do that.</v>

2235
01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2236
01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:18.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm just joking around obviously about the gas,</v>

2237
01:04:18.411 --> 01:04:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Maddie's fuel and people up in math,</v>

2238
01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:22.610
<v Speaker 2>but if they can,</v>

2239
01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:22.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2240
01:04:22.941 --> 01:04:23.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2241
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:26.430
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you it's going to be just like trying to get medical marijuana</v>

2242
01:04:26.431 --> 01:04:27.020
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>

2243
01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.750
<v Speaker 2>The pharmaceutical companies are going to lobby against it because they know</v>

2244
01:04:29.751 --> 01:04:30.710
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to lose money.</v>

2245
01:04:30.711 --> 01:04:33.440
<v Speaker 2>So the gas company's going to lobby against us because they know it's going to</v>

2246
01:04:33.441 --> 01:04:34.240
<v Speaker 2>cost them money.</v>

2247
01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

2248
01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:34.940
<v Speaker 2>And dealt,</v>

2249
01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:38.300
<v Speaker 2>still play dirty because you're dealing with billions of while President Rogan</v>

2250
01:04:38.301 --> 01:04:38.771
<v Speaker 2>is there.</v>

2251
01:04:38.771 --> 01:04:40.070
<v Speaker 2>He's resonant.</v>

2252
01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Rolling.</v>

2253
01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Please.</v>

2254
01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:42.660
<v Speaker 2>People will have to be immortal around,</v>

2255
01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:45.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to do it remotely from Mars.</v>

2256
01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:45.430
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2257
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:48.230
<v Speaker 2>that's when President Roh Rogan runs everything from the Internet,</v>

2258
01:04:48.231 --> 01:04:49.010
<v Speaker 2>from Mars.</v>

2259
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:51.170
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking earth would be a wasteland by then.</v>

2260
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Everyone will be gone.</v>

2261
01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:55.010
<v Speaker 2>Mars would be like the gated community of space.</v>

2262
01:04:58.960 --> 01:04:59.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2263
01:04:59.181 --> 01:05:02.930
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking terraform with fake fake plants growing everywhere.</v>

2264
01:05:02.931 --> 01:05:05.900
<v Speaker 2>Everyone eating fake Chinese eggs and that'll be the day when people say the</v>

2265
01:05:05.901 --> 01:05:07.310
<v Speaker 2>hills and they're talking about Mars.</v>

2266
01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.090
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2267
01:05:08.090 --> 01:05:08.901
<v Speaker 2>Is it the hills though?</v>

2268
01:05:08.901 --> 01:05:09.711
<v Speaker 2>Subject to anymore.</v>

2269
01:05:09.711 --> 01:05:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Who's talking about the hills?</v>

2270
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:12.050
<v Speaker 2>So I was talking to me about the hills.</v>

2271
01:05:12.051 --> 01:05:14.030
<v Speaker 2>I fucking plug my ears and I walk away.</v>

2272
01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:14.221
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2273
01:05:14.221 --> 01:05:16.220
<v Speaker 2>I've been in La for three weeks now and people are,</v>

2274
01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.320
<v Speaker 2>there's a party in the hills.</v>

2275
01:05:17.321 --> 01:05:17.820
<v Speaker 2>We're going to the,</v>

2276
01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2277
01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:19.001
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

2278
01:05:19.001 --> 01:05:20.650
<v Speaker 3>I thought you meant the show.</v>

2279
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:22.000
<v Speaker 3>No show called the hills,</v>

2280
01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:22.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2281
01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:26.320
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't that the one with the fucking the girl got all the plastic surgery.</v>

2282
01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:26.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2283
01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:27.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2284
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:28.343
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

2285
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:29.890
<v Speaker 3>You meet the Hollywood hills.</v>

2286
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:30.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2287
01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:30.870
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2288
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:32.530
<v Speaker 3>the Hollywood hills a terrible,</v>

2289
01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.800
<v Speaker 3>but what they're amazing for is that fucking view at night.</v>

2290
01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.600
<v Speaker 3>It's not like anywhere else in the world.</v>

2291
01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:41.170
<v Speaker 3>If you get high above doe Heeney I had a buddy used to have a house on</v>

2292
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:42.063
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

2293
01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:43.420
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>

2294
01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:46.960
<v Speaker 3>That view is like blade runner because you see the grid,</v>

2295
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:48.730
<v Speaker 3>the the light grid at night.</v>

2296
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:50.470
<v Speaker 3>It looks like shit during the day.</v>

2297
01:05:50.471 --> 01:05:55.120
<v Speaker 3>It looks like dog shit cause you just see gray buildings and and fucking smog.</v>

2298
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:58.390
<v Speaker 3>But at nighttime it looks like a science fiction movie.</v>

2299
01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.400
<v Speaker 3>It's incredibly beautiful,</v>

2300
01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:03.460
<v Speaker 3>like way more beautiful than the neon lights of Vegas cause it's,</v>

2301
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:05.350
<v Speaker 3>it's oddly symmetrical.</v>

2302
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:08.260
<v Speaker 3>It's really fascinating because they're right above it.</v>

2303
01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:11.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like the perfect height above it for this amazing light show I got.</v>

2304
01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:12.523
<v Speaker 3>I got to see that.</v>

2305
01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:13.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2306
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:13.510
<v Speaker 3>it's dope.</v>

2307
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:14.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a great place to live.</v>

2308
01:06:14.501 --> 01:06:16.060
<v Speaker 3>But as far as like,</v>

2309
01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:16.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2310
01:06:16.721 --> 01:06:19.780
<v Speaker 3>places that you would want to actually live.</v>

2311
01:06:19.781 --> 01:06:21.130
<v Speaker 3>Other than that for that view,</v>

2312
01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.270
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking Hollywood hills.</v>

2313
01:06:22.310 --> 01:06:23.200
<v Speaker 3>Fairly douchey.</v>

2314
01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:24.161
<v Speaker 3>It's not just douchey.</v>

2315
01:06:24.161 --> 01:06:24.971
<v Speaker 3>It's dangerous.</v>

2316
01:06:24.971 --> 01:06:27.970
<v Speaker 3>I know two people that had been home invaded up there fuck off.</v>

2317
01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:28.781
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah man.</v>

2318
01:06:28.781 --> 01:06:31.510
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole scam with people watching your house.</v>

2319
01:06:31.511 --> 01:06:31.811
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>

2320
01:06:31.811 --> 01:06:32.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2321
01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.090
<v Speaker 3>people park cars and cases.</v>

2322
01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2323
01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.180
<v Speaker 3>Well there was a guy that was selling a house up there.</v>

2324
01:06:37.181 --> 01:06:38.970
<v Speaker 3>It's a fascinating story and a,</v>

2325
01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:41.860
<v Speaker 3>for a very brief time I thought about living up there.</v>

2326
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:42.371
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2327
01:06:42.371 --> 01:06:42.521
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2328
01:06:42.521 --> 01:06:42.990
<v Speaker 3>it'd be nice.</v>

2329
01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:44.260
<v Speaker 3>I was closer to the comedy store.</v>

2330
01:06:44.261 --> 01:06:46.090
<v Speaker 3>I could just get down to the comedy store in 10 minutes.</v>

2331
01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:46.231
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2332
01:06:46.231 --> 01:06:47.320
<v Speaker 3>that would be kind of Nice.</v>

2333
01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:48.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2334
01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:49.350
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

2335
01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:50.740
<v Speaker 3>it's just a fucking,</v>

2336
01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:52.570
<v Speaker 3>just not a committed thought at all.</v>

2337
01:06:52.571 --> 01:06:53.404
<v Speaker 3>Just a,</v>

2338
01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:54.483
<v Speaker 3>that's the view.</v>

2339
01:06:54.550 --> 01:06:55.840
<v Speaker 3>That's how spectacular that looks.</v>

2340
01:06:55.841 --> 01:06:56.674
<v Speaker 3>Look at that shit up there.</v>

2341
01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.990
<v Speaker 3>That's really what it looks like from my boy's house.</v>

2342
01:06:58.991 --> 01:07:00.060
<v Speaker 3>It was in cuffs were ratable.</v>

2343
01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:01.720
<v Speaker 3>His was even better than that.</v>

2344
01:07:01.721 --> 01:07:02.830
<v Speaker 3>His was a little lower.</v>

2345
01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:04.870
<v Speaker 3>He's like on the edge of what we're looking,</v>

2346
01:07:04.871 --> 01:07:07.990
<v Speaker 3>you're looking down at some houses and then that he was at the edge.</v>

2347
01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:11.860
<v Speaker 3>So all he saw was the grid and it was just magnificent.</v>

2348
01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:12.641
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

2349
01:07:12.641 --> 01:07:15.100
<v Speaker 3>this guy had this pretty nice house up there and he had a really pretty view</v>

2350
01:07:15.101 --> 01:07:15.850
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2351
01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:16.181
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2352
01:07:16.181 --> 01:07:16.231
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2353
01:07:16.231 --> 01:07:17.080
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about it,</v>

2354
01:07:17.081 --> 01:07:17.411
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

2355
01:07:17.411 --> 01:07:17.621
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2356
01:07:17.621 --> 01:07:18.454
<v Speaker 3>I just don't like,</v>

2357
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:20.080
<v Speaker 3>this house is so showy.</v>

2358
01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:21.790
<v Speaker 3>And it's like right on the street.</v>

2359
01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.050
<v Speaker 3>Like anyone could just wa,</v>

2360
01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:27.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's literally you could throw a person from the sidewalk and slam</v>

2361
01:07:27.971 --> 01:07:30.760
<v Speaker 3>through the window where you could pick someone up and use them as a rock to</v>

2362
01:07:30.761 --> 01:07:31.750
<v Speaker 3>hurl through this guy's window.</v>

2363
01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:32.291
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2364
01:07:32.291 --> 01:07:33.520
<v Speaker 3>that just doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

2365
01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:34.251
<v Speaker 3>And he'd go,</v>

2366
01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:34.451
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2367
01:07:34.451 --> 01:07:36.580
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be a state of the art security system.</v>

2368
01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:37.450
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2369
01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:37.781
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2370
01:07:37.781 --> 01:07:38.070
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2371
01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:39.730
<v Speaker 3>These cameras and you know what that is?</v>

2372
01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:40.061
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2373
01:07:40.061 --> 01:07:42.790
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get a video of a dude with a ski mask robbing you.</v>

2374
01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:45.130
<v Speaker 3>This is what I said to him.</v>

2375
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:47.590
<v Speaker 3>Two weeks later he was dead.</v>

2376
01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:49.750
<v Speaker 3>He shot in the neck,</v>

2377
01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.940
<v Speaker 3>in a home invasion in that very house.</v>

2378
01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:53.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2379
01:07:53.101 --> 01:07:53.980
<v Speaker 3>He used to like hookers.</v>

2380
01:07:53.981 --> 01:07:57.820
<v Speaker 3>This guy who's crate and we used to call him wild man.</v>

2381
01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:00.640
<v Speaker 3>I had a buddy who worked at a strip club and uh,</v>

2382
01:08:00.641 --> 01:08:04.180
<v Speaker 3>this dude used to come in and he apparently invented like bell bottoms or</v>

2383
01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:05.350
<v Speaker 3>something nutty like that.</v>

2384
01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.350
<v Speaker 3>Like he invented something and made a fuck load of money.</v>

2385
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:10.780
<v Speaker 3>And it was owl calls if you live in a glass house.</v>

2386
01:08:10.810 --> 01:08:11.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2387
01:08:11.201 --> 01:08:14.260
<v Speaker 3>And he was getting a emphysema because of his,</v>

2388
01:08:14.261 --> 01:08:15.094
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2389
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.093
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing dude?</v>

2390
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:17.900
<v Speaker 2>That's just showing stuff like you're talking about.</v>

2391
01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:18.261
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2392
01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:18.680
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2393
01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.513
<v Speaker 2>That does the same thing.</v>

2394
01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2395
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:21.140
<v Speaker 2>he was um,</v>

2396
01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:25.640
<v Speaker 2>he was getting emphysema from cigarettes and so he decided to quit the</v>

2397
01:08:25.641 --> 01:08:27.200
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes and his doctor told them,</v>

2398
01:08:27.201 --> 01:08:27.381
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2399
01:08:27.381 --> 01:08:29.000
<v Speaker 2>if you have to smoke smoke marijuana,</v>

2400
01:08:29.001 --> 01:08:29.960
<v Speaker 2>at least it's not going to kill you.</v>

2401
01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:33.740
<v Speaker 2>So this dude's are smoking marijuana and decides he doesn't want to work</v>

2402
01:08:33.741 --> 01:08:34.574
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

2403
01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:37.370
<v Speaker 2>decides all he wants to do from now on.</v>

2404
01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:41.180
<v Speaker 2>He wants to play his guitar and then he wants to get prostitutes.</v>

2405
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.500
<v Speaker 2>So he's got a lot of money and he thinks he's almost dead right?</v>

2406
01:08:45.501 --> 01:08:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Cause he had emphysema.</v>

2407
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:50.210
<v Speaker 2>So he goes to the strip clubs and starts paying girls to have sex with them,</v>

2408
01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:51.650
<v Speaker 2>like incredible money,</v>

2409
01:08:51.651 --> 01:08:52.760
<v Speaker 2>like $3,000,</v>

2410
01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:53.571
<v Speaker 2>$4,000,</v>

2411
01:08:53.571 --> 01:08:54.381
<v Speaker 2>$5,000.</v>

2412
01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:55.214
<v Speaker 2>What am I going to pay you?</v>

2413
01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:55.791
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2414
01:08:55.791 --> 01:08:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Gravelly cigarette voice.</v>

2415
01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:01.670
<v Speaker 2>And apparently he was really rude to these girls and one of them came over to</v>

2416
01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:04.210
<v Speaker 2>his house and brought a guy and they,</v>

2417
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:07.640
<v Speaker 2>the guy came in and robbed him and shot him in the neck.</v>

2418
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:10.730
<v Speaker 2>And this was the very house that I was telling him,</v>

2419
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:14.000
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get robbed by a dude with a ski mask and they got to get a nice</v>

2420
01:09:14.001 --> 01:09:16.150
<v Speaker 2>video of that and no one's ever going to catch that.</v>

2421
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2422
01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.220
<v Speaker 2>The heaviest a podcast ever.</v>

2423
01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:20.361
<v Speaker 2>Well it was,</v>

2424
01:09:20.361 --> 01:09:21.650
<v Speaker 2>he was a weird guy man.</v>

2425
01:09:21.651 --> 01:09:22.880
<v Speaker 2>This this guy wild man.</v>

2426
01:09:22.881 --> 01:09:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Cause it was when you hear like the mean shit that he would say to the girls or</v>

2427
01:09:26.241 --> 01:09:27.260
<v Speaker 2>even about the girls,</v>

2428
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.920
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2429
01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:31.140
<v Speaker 2>it didn't make you sympathetic to him but you know on another hand like I</v>

2430
01:09:31.141 --> 01:09:32.990
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't get shot in the neck and his house.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I Dunno what the circumstances were.</v>

2433
01:09:36.321 --> 01:09:37.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you had a comment,</v>

2434
01:09:37.401 --> 01:09:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck happened but I do know that the Hollywood hills gets</v>

2435
01:09:41.601 --> 01:09:42.710
<v Speaker 2>broken into a lot.</v>

2436
01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:46.130
<v Speaker 2>I had another friend who lived up there who caught a guy trying to break into</v>

2437
01:09:46.131 --> 01:09:47.240
<v Speaker 2>his house in the middle of the night.</v>

2438
01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:49.191
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

2439
01:09:49.191 --> 01:09:50.024
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2442
01:09:51.711 --> 01:09:52.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a tricky spot.</v>

2443
01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a tricky spot because it's,</v>

2444
01:09:54.051 --> 01:09:54.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2445

<v Speaker 2>it's so affluent and so accessible.</v>

2446
01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:57.351
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2447
01:09:57.351 --> 01:09:57.711

01:10:02.751 --> 01:10:06.320
<v Speaker 2>so someone could like sneak in from a bad neighborhood slip up there.</v>

2457
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:10.490
<v Speaker 2>It's not like Beverly hills where they have like constant drives where the cops</v>

2458
01:10:10.491 --> 01:10:12.350
<v Speaker 2>are called constantly cruising the neighborhood,</v>

2459
01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:14.900
<v Speaker 2>making sure there's no suspicious people and all that.</v>

2460
01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:15.891
<v Speaker 2>The Hollywood hills,</v>

2461
01:10:15.891 --> 01:10:19.160
<v Speaker 2>everybody's driving up there and wandering around so it gets,</v>

2462
01:10:19.161 --> 01:10:19.401
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2463
01:10:19.401 --> 01:10:20.240
<v Speaker 2>it gets sketch.</v>

2464
01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Ice Tea got held up up there.</v>

2465
01:10:22.491 --> 01:10:24.410
<v Speaker 2>Ice Tea used to have a house in the Hollywood hills.</v>

2466
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:25.520
<v Speaker 2>He got home invaded.</v>

2467
01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:27.530
<v Speaker 2>He got held up at gun.</v>

2468
01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.330
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty common.</v>

2469
01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:30.590
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know it was like that.</v>

2470
01:10:30.650 --> 01:10:30.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2471
01:10:30.981 --> 01:10:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Well it's a lot of money whenever you have a lot of money.</v>

2472
01:10:33.351 --> 01:10:33.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2475
01:10:35.691 --> 01:10:36.530
<v Speaker 2>beautiful houses.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2477
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.450
<v Speaker 2>you look at a house like that,</v>

2478
01:10:38.451 --> 01:10:38.631
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2479
01:10:38.631 --> 01:10:39.920
<v Speaker 2>that house is worth $7 million.</v>

2480
01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.380
<v Speaker 2>So this motherfucker in his house got $7 million.</v>

2482
01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.450
<v Speaker 2>So you wait until someone's closing their garage and then you run out of the</v>

2483
01:10:47.451 --> 01:10:48.350
<v Speaker 2>bushes and boom,</v>

2484
01:10:48.351 --> 01:10:49.940
<v Speaker 2>you're in the garage and you can't get up there.</v>

2485
01:10:49.941 --> 01:10:50.451
<v Speaker 2>FASC it.</v>

2486

2489
01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:54.260
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to call the cops too?</v>

2490
01:10:54.261 --> 01:10:55.270
<v Speaker 2>You don't get cell phone signal.</v>

2491
01:10:55.290 --> 01:10:56.123
<v Speaker 2>Your fucking house.</v>

2492
01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:59.610
<v Speaker 2>Eddie is a staying at the motel eights.</v>

2493
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:03.080
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] it's all done.</v>

2494
01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm just hanging out with the people that robbed them.</v>

2495
01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:06.360
<v Speaker 2>We'll add that.</v>

2496
01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:06.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2497
01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:08.510
<v Speaker 2>as the economy gets,</v>

2498
01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:12.020
<v Speaker 2>there's a further and further gap between people with money because without</v>

2499
01:11:12.021 --> 01:11:13.200
<v Speaker 2>money it becomes more,</v>

2500
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:14.370
<v Speaker 2>it becomes more and more dangerous</v>

2501
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.390
<v Speaker 3>to flaunt it like that,</v>

2502
01:11:15.391 --> 01:11:16.830
<v Speaker 3>especially in the middle of a city.</v>

2503
01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:17.430
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

2504
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.610
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2505
01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:20.640
<v Speaker 3>that's why I always freaked out about Hancock Park.</v>

2506
01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:21.361
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2507
01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:24.540
<v Speaker 3>Hancock Park has these insanely beautiful homes,</v>

2508
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:27.570
<v Speaker 3>the insanely beautiful like old world,</v>

2509
01:11:27.571 --> 01:11:28.950
<v Speaker 3>old Hollywood houses,</v>

2510
01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.270
<v Speaker 3>these giant mansions.</v>

2511
01:11:30.271 --> 01:11:34.020
<v Speaker 3>Like a friend of mine went over this guy's house and she said that he has like a</v>

2512
01:11:34.021 --> 01:11:34.920
<v Speaker 3>theater in his house,</v>

2513
01:11:34.921 --> 01:11:39.540
<v Speaker 3>like a full theater with velvet curtains and incredible gold guild work.</v>

2514
01:11:39.541 --> 01:11:44.040
<v Speaker 3>And the house was built in the 20s like some fucking Cary grant guy built it and</v>

2515
01:11:44.041 --> 01:11:44.281
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

2516
01:11:44.281 --> 01:11:48.090
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing and it's fucking five blocks from east La,</v>

2517
01:11:48.130 --> 01:11:48.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2518
01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Five blocks from a store where all the signs are in Spanish,</v>

2519
01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:52.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2520
01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:52.620
<v Speaker 3>and you're,</v>

2521
01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:53.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2522
01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:58.400
<v Speaker 3>you're living in this crazy stupid mansion that's so close to like abject</v>

2523
01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:00.000
<v Speaker 3>poverty.</v>

2524
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.740
<v Speaker 3>Well I was starting on people.</v>

2525
01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:03.600
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what you get is dangerous.</v>

2526
01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:05.280
<v Speaker 3>But speaking about Florida,</v>

2527
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:06.360
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2528
01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:07.330
<v Speaker 3>I always think that,</v>

2529
01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:10.180
<v Speaker 5>I think that when I go to Miami,</v>

2530
01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:10.571
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

2531
01:12:10.571 --> 01:12:12.940
<v Speaker 5>because you go on one side of the,</v>

2532
01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:16.170
<v Speaker 5>and it's like baby blue Bentleys and,</v>

2533
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:18.460
<v Speaker 5>and like these crazy like Pan House,</v>

2534
01:12:18.461 --> 01:12:19.870
<v Speaker 5>like $20 million places.</v>

2535
01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:21.580
<v Speaker 5>And literally on the other side,</v>

2536
01:12:21.581 --> 01:12:23.270
<v Speaker 5>it's like El Salvadorian,</v>

2537
01:12:23.530 --> 01:12:24.970
<v Speaker 5>Guatemala and sorta like,</v>

2538
01:12:24.971 --> 01:12:25.241
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2539
01:12:25.241 --> 01:12:26.570
<v Speaker 5>99 cent but booze,</v>

01:12:27.191 --> 01:12:28.024
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

2542
01:12:28.330 --> 01:12:32.530
<v Speaker 5>why don't these dudes from this side of the street who by the way of growing up</v>

2543
01:12:32.531 --> 01:12:36.310
<v Speaker 5>in El Salvador and they're not sorta any stranger to hard times,</v>

2544
01:12:36.850 --> 01:12:38.500
<v Speaker 5>walk across and just take it,</v>

2545
01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:39.640
<v Speaker 3>you guys fucking car.</v>

2546
01:12:39.850 --> 01:12:40.780
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't you do that?</v>

2547
01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:41.441
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2548
01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:43.030
<v Speaker 3>because they're honorable people and they're happy.</v>

2549
01:12:43.031 --> 01:12:43.930
<v Speaker 3>They're not in El Salvador.</v>

2550
01:12:43.931 --> 01:12:45.230
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to get arrested in Americans.</v>

2551
01:12:45.231 --> 01:12:46.090
<v Speaker 3>So they get kicked out.</v>

2552
01:12:46.150 --> 01:12:48.250
<v Speaker 3>I would do it if I was broke and starving,</v>

2553
01:12:48.251 --> 01:12:51.100
<v Speaker 3>I would go across and click here to make their own dreams come true.</v>

2702
01:17:11.691 --> 01:17:12.560
<v Speaker 3>it's broken down.</v>

2703
01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:13.583
<v Speaker 3>Ha.</v>

2704

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2708
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:19.130
<v Speaker 3>There were not really designed to be used.</v>

2709
01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:20.060
<v Speaker 3>They just cool.</v>

2710
01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:23.780
<v Speaker 3>They're just a massive feat of engineering and twisted steel.</v>

2711
01:17:24.150 --> 01:17:28.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh quarter together with fucking screws and they just stomp on that explosion</v>

2712
01:17:28.731 --> 01:17:32.300
<v Speaker 3>box they call an engine and hope it all stays together as it rattles apart.</v>

2713
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:34.760
<v Speaker 3>Plus it's built by guineas.</v>

2714
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:36.110
<v Speaker 3>Don't trust my people,</v>

2715

<v Speaker 3>It mean Ferrari.</v>

2718
01:17:43.401 --> 01:17:46.490
<v Speaker 3>The only reason why they keep it together as their rich heritage and racing and</v>

2719
01:17:46.491 --> 01:17:48.380
<v Speaker 3>their ego and winning racing.</v>

2720
01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:50.330
<v Speaker 3>Because if you take all that out of the loop,</v>

2724
01:17:56.931 --> 01:18:00.050
<v Speaker 3>I forget a screw and you're fucking wheels going to go flying off when you're on</v>

2725
01:18:00.051 --> 01:18:00.884
<v Speaker 3>turn three.</v>

2726
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:01.131
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2727
01:18:01.131 --> 01:18:04.670

2728
01:18:04.671 --> 01:18:05.504
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2729
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:07.310
<v Speaker 3>This is one word.</v>

2730
01:18:07.311 --> 01:18:08.540
<v Speaker 3>Guy Gets hit by a car.</v>

2731
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:09.351
<v Speaker 3>If you back that up,</v>

2732
01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:09.921
<v Speaker 3>you could see it.</v>

2733
01:18:09.921 --> 01:18:11.090
<v Speaker 3>You didn't see it in this video.</v>

2734
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.781
<v Speaker 3>If you look at this,</v>

2735
01:18:11.781 --> 01:18:12.710
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

2741
01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Apparently the cars are designed to break away like that and the event of a</v>

2742
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:27.650
<v Speaker 3>serious collision.</v>

2743
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:29.390
<v Speaker 3>That's an Aventador.</v>

2744
01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:29.591
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

01:18:34.911 --> 01:18:37.130
<v Speaker 3>They take long breaks in the middle of the day.</v>

2750
01:18:37.131 --> 01:18:38.150
<v Speaker 3>They take naps,</v>

2751
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:39.770
<v Speaker 3>they drink wine at work.</v>

2752
01:18:39.771 --> 01:18:41.240
<v Speaker 3>Those people are fucking savages.</v>

2753
01:18:41.241 --> 01:18:44.180
<v Speaker 3>All they're thinking about is putting that car together and making enough money</v>

2754
01:18:44.181 --> 01:18:45.890
<v Speaker 3>so that they can just fuck for six months.</v>

2755
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:47.630
<v Speaker 3>Great track suits though.</v>

2756
01:18:47.710 --> 01:18:47.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2757
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:49.070
<v Speaker 3>They make good track suits.</v>

2758
01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:50.220
<v Speaker 3>They were wearing</v>

2759
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:55.520
<v Speaker 3>tracksuits still fly in New York.</v>

2760
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:57.290
<v Speaker 3>La has not embraced the tracksuit.</v>

2761
01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:58.483
<v Speaker 3>Never did.</v>

2762
01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.650
<v Speaker 3>If you like show up and you're hanging around a track suit,</v>

2763
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:03.080
<v Speaker 3>they assume you're either Armenian or you're from New York.</v>

2764
01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:07.370
<v Speaker 3>Armenians can Baraka track suit in La Nla they're great,</v>

2765

01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:09.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't fuck with buttons or zippers anymore.</v>

2767
01:19:09.730 --> 01:19:10.460
<v Speaker 3>Smart.</v>

2768
01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:13.940
<v Speaker 3>I should have been on that a long time ago because I'm not scared of a fanny</v>

2769
01:19:13.941 --> 01:19:14.660
<v Speaker 3>pack.</v>

2770
01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:17.240
<v Speaker 3>Fanny pack with a track suit is an excellent combination.</v>

2771
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:20.860
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather just be fat and wear elastic bands and look awesome and perfect,</v>

2772
01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:21.890
<v Speaker 3>but even if you're skinny,</v>

2773
01:19:21.891 --> 01:19:22.641
<v Speaker 3>it's still comfortable.</v>

2774
01:19:22.641 --> 01:19:24.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to wear pajamas.</v>

2775
01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:27.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm just wearing like weather resistant pajamas.</v>

2776
01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:28.790
<v Speaker 3>That's the best.</v>

2777
01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:31.410
<v Speaker 3>Rodney Dangerfield back and is back in the dizzy.</v>

2778
01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm used to go on stage.</v>

2779
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Rondi would wear a bathrobe,</v>

2780
01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:38.570
<v Speaker 3>nothing on underneath and with slippers and just walk on stage.</v>

2781
01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:39.890
<v Speaker 3>And it was because,</v>

2782
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2783
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:41.690
<v Speaker 3>it prevented,</v>

2784
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:42.860
<v Speaker 3>I think it prevented,</v>

2785
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2786
01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:46.220
<v Speaker 3>you know anybody from taking him seriously because he's not out there with a</v>

2787
01:19:46.221 --> 01:19:46.761
<v Speaker 3>suit on.</v>

2788
01:19:46.761 --> 01:19:47.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2789
01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:48.170
<v Speaker 3>right away you're like,</v>

2790
01:19:48.171 --> 01:19:49.010
<v Speaker 3>you're laughing and you're like,</v>

2791
01:19:49.011 --> 01:19:49.131
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2792
01:19:49.131 --> 01:19:49.840
<v Speaker 3>we have Rodney.</v>

2793
01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:50.870
<v Speaker 3>He opened shirt.</v>

2794
01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:51.381
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

2795
01:19:51.381 --> 01:19:54.050
<v Speaker 3>it was obvious it was nothing on underneath there wearing slippers.</v>

2796
01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:55.340
<v Speaker 3>But it was also,</v>

2797
01:19:55.341 --> 01:19:59.420
<v Speaker 3>he was so loose because he came out there with a bathrobe on that he was just</v>

2798
01:19:59.870 --> 01:20:01.990
<v Speaker 3>giving no fucks out there.</v>

2799
01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:05.000
<v Speaker 3>Powerful Rodney Dangerfield for Rodney Dangerfield and he,</v>

2800
01:20:05.001 --> 01:20:06.110
<v Speaker 3>that was an original move.</v>

2801
01:20:06.130 --> 01:20:10.230
<v Speaker 3>I'd never heard anybody doing that before him and he did it later in his career,</v>

2802
01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:12.300
<v Speaker 3>so it was most likely born out of one day.</v>

2803
01:20:12.301 --> 01:20:14.330
<v Speaker 3>He was backstage in his bathrobe and they said,</v>

2804
01:20:14.331 --> 01:20:14.701
<v Speaker 3>Rodney,</v>

2805
01:20:14.701 --> 01:20:15.360
<v Speaker 3>you're on.</v>

2806
01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:15.721

2807
01:20:15.721 --> 01:20:16.051

2809
01:20:18.181 --> 01:20:18.900
<v Speaker 3>There he is.</v>

2810
01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:22.170
<v Speaker 3>That's how he used to walk and his package was always hanging out.</v>

2811
01:20:22.570 --> 01:20:22.890
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2812
01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:24.310
<v Speaker 3>Apparently at a monster hog too.</v>

2813
01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:25.523
<v Speaker 10>He didn't give a fuck.</v>

2814
01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:28.740
<v Speaker 10>Meet Peeping Rodney Dangerfield and there wasn't a,</v>

2815
01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:29.101
<v Speaker 10>what was it,</v>

2816
01:20:29.101 --> 01:20:30.690
<v Speaker 10>bread skeleton or something.</v>

2817
01:20:30.691 --> 01:20:32.130
<v Speaker 10>Who was the guy who ran the famous</v>

2818
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:33.163
<v Speaker 3>Milton Berle?</v>

2819
01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:33.351
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2820
01:20:33.351 --> 01:20:37.370
<v Speaker 3>Milton Berle famous for his giant hog and his love of stolen jokes.</v>

2821
01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Famous joke thief with a giant hug.</v>

2822
01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:42.440
<v Speaker 3>That was the word back in the day,</v>

2823
01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:45.200
<v Speaker 3>but I think joke thief was a different sort of thing back then.</v>

2824
01:20:45.410 --> 01:20:50.240
<v Speaker 3>I think they all had like gags and they use them into the interchange them like</v>

2825
01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.610
<v Speaker 3>guy would work the Catskills,</v>

2826
01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:52.490
<v Speaker 3>then another guy would work.</v>

2827
01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:54.140
<v Speaker 3>They would do like a lot of the same material.</v>

2828
01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:56.720
<v Speaker 3>There was nobody writing anything down back then.</v>

2829
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:59.540
<v Speaker 3>There was no blogs or people get shit on you for doing that.</v>

2830
01:20:59.541 --> 01:21:00.374
<v Speaker 3>There was also,</v>

2831
01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:01.790
<v Speaker 3>if you steal someone's joke now,</v>

2832
01:21:01.791 --> 01:21:02.624
<v Speaker 3>is it a big deal?</v>

2833
01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:02.931
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2834
01:21:02.931 --> 01:21:05.150
<v Speaker 3>If you get caught stealing someone's joke now you're fucked.</v>

2835
01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:05.810

01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:08.150
<v Speaker 3>By the Internet.</v>

2839
01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:08.631
<v Speaker 3>The Internet.</v>

2840
01:21:08.631 --> 01:21:12.470
<v Speaker 3>We'll find out and they'll expose it and I think people won't take you</v>

2841
01:21:12.471 --> 01:21:13.040
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>

<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2889
01:22:16.810 --> 01:22:17.830
<v Speaker 3>In a series of tweets,</v>

2890
01:22:17.831 --> 01:22:21.640
<v Speaker 3>he admitted on Tuesday that he fucked up in quotes by failing to acknowledge the</v>

2891
01:22:21.641 --> 01:22:25.570
<v Speaker 3>short film he passed off as an original work was actually inspired by,</v>

2892
01:22:25.571 --> 01:22:30.370
<v Speaker 3>if not an entire rip off of a graphic novella written by artists.</v>

2893
01:22:30.371 --> 01:22:34.840
<v Speaker 3>Daniel close by way of apology laboo is that what you're saying?</v>

2894
01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:35.693
<v Speaker 3>The booth,</v>

2895
01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:36.730
<v Speaker 3>that's what he deserves.</v>

2896
01:22:36.731 --> 01:22:41.731
<v Speaker 3>The tweeted in that his excitement and naivete as an amateur film maker,</v>

2897
01:22:41.861 --> 01:22:45.550
<v Speaker 3>he got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper</v>

2898
01:22:45.551 --> 01:22:46.384
<v Speaker 3>accreditation.</v>

2899
01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2901
01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:49.210
<v Speaker 3>that's nonsense.</v>

2902
01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:54.070
<v Speaker 3>I want Alec Baldwin to release a statement about this naivete and excitement may</v>

2903
01:22:54.071 --> 01:22:56.770
<v Speaker 3>well have played their part in this fairly brazen breach of etiquette.</v>

2904
01:22:56.771 --> 01:22:57.740
<v Speaker 3>But considering the booze,</v>

2905
01:22:57.741 --> 01:22:59.560
<v Speaker 3>previous run ins with plagiarism,</v>

2906

01:23:03.850 --> 01:23:04.301
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

2909
01:23:04.301 --> 01:23:05.530
<v Speaker 3>What did this guy before?</v>

2910
01:23:05.531 --> 01:23:07.300
<v Speaker 3>What was he accused of before?</v>

2911
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:09.310
<v Speaker 3>But stealing dining clouds,</v>

2912
01:23:09.311 --> 01:23:10.091
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get caught.</v>

2913
01:23:10.091 --> 01:23:10.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's not that smart</v>

2918
01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:19.150
<v Speaker 3>answers to think they're way smarter than they are.</v>

2919
01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:21.970
<v Speaker 3>They get really confused because everybody listens to him on the set.</v>

2920
01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:23.200
<v Speaker 3>And that's how they judge.</v>

2921
01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:23.871
<v Speaker 3>Like they're,</v>

2922
01:23:23.871 --> 01:23:25.720
<v Speaker 3>they're like their ecosystem.</v>

2923
01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:26.081

01:23:31.810 --> 01:23:31.961
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2928
01:23:31.961 --> 01:23:33.250
<v Speaker 3>you're delusional because people are,</v>

2929
01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:34.550
<v Speaker 3>they're not being honest with you all.</v>

2930
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:36.610
<v Speaker 3>And then you go to a red carpet thing and they're not,</v>

2931
01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:36.881

2946
01:23:58.810 --> 01:24:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Copying isn't particularly creative,</v>

2947
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:02.200
<v Speaker 3>creative work,</v>

2948
01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:06.130
<v Speaker 3>being inspired by someone else's idea to produce something new and different is</v>

2949
01:24:06.131 --> 01:24:06.964
<v Speaker 3>creative work.</v>

2950
01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:08.380
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

2951
01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:11.020
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the dumbest things I've ever,</v>

2952
01:24:11.170 --> 01:24:12.580
<v Speaker 3>that's like the weirdest,</v>

2953
01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:19.740
<v Speaker 3>weirdest admission slash ego chest puff copying is in particularly creative</v>

2954
01:24:20.561 --> 01:24:21.130
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

2955
01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:24.640
<v Speaker 3>being inspired by someone else's work to produce something new and different is</v>

2956
01:24:24.641 --> 01:24:25.360
<v Speaker 3>creative work.</v>

2957
01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:25.660
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2958
01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:28.660
<v Speaker 3>but he copied and he also said,</v>

2959
01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.010
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mean to copy,</v>

2960
01:24:30.011 --> 01:24:31.090
<v Speaker 3>I forgot to acknowledge it,</v>

2961
01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.040
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2962
01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:34.270
<v Speaker 3>I was creative anyway.</v>

2963
01:24:34.330 --> 01:24:38.170
<v Speaker 3>And they're also saying that his apology might've been plagiarized.</v>

2964
01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:39.370
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

2965
01:24:39.370 --> 01:24:40.203
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2966
01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:43.840
<v Speaker 3>His apology apparently looks familiar to someone else's apology for,</v>

2967
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.981
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

2968
01:24:44.981 --> 01:24:45.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2969
01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.300
<v Speaker 3>for doing that.</v>

2970
01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh my goodness.</v>

2971
01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:49.751

2973
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.823
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2974
01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:54.510
<v Speaker 3>Did,</v>

2975
01:24:54.510 --> 01:24:55.510
<v Speaker 3>did he say that?</v>

2976
01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.040
<v Speaker 3>I guess he paraphrased.</v>

2977
01:24:57.100 --> 01:24:57.731
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2978

01:24:58.540 --> 01:24:59.560
<v Speaker 3>that's nitpicking.</v>

2981
01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2982
01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:01.840
<v Speaker 3>Unless they have a better exam,</v>

2983
01:25:02.410 --> 01:25:03.820
<v Speaker 3>plagiarized and apology.</v>

2984
01:25:03.821 --> 01:25:07.060

<v Speaker 3>creative work and it may have even washed analyze the stolen concept.</v>

3138
01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:41.520
<v Speaker 4>It's all fueled by ego.</v>

3139
01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:42.573
<v Speaker 4>It's just this</v>

3140
01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:48.880
<v Speaker 7>ego that he has to dam up doesn't even want to do like high end female.</v>

3147
01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:02.063
<v Speaker 4>Because it's like,</v>

3148
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:05.250
<v Speaker 4>why are you yelling about that on a rap radio station?</v>

3149
01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:08.220
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to dress like Kim Kardashian,</v>

3150
01:30:08.221 --> 01:30:09.330
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't take much.</v>

3151
01:30:09.610 --> 01:30:13.590
<v Speaker 4>Just take some Reynold's wrap clear Reynolds wrap and wrap it around that bitch</v>

3152
01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:15.600
<v Speaker 4>like that is the best thing she will look like.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Do you really don't?</v>

<v Speaker 4>You don't think that there's like probably addressed it with better than</v>

3156
01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:20.520

3159
01:30:23.581 --> 01:30:26.400
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a problem with Saran wrap and a big problem is that the shit is</v>

3160
01:30:26.401 --> 01:30:27.234
<v Speaker 4>hard to get off.</v>

01:34:08.401 --> 01:34:10.510
<v Speaker 13>we wanted to get in the street next stupid,</v>

3294
01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:10.891
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

3295
01:34:10.891 --> 01:34:15.720
<v Speaker 13>be wanting to fight with the tricks and fight with the police and talking crazy</v>

3296
01:34:15.721 --> 01:34:16.554
<v Speaker 13>and</v>

3297
01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:19.650
<v Speaker 13>she can't take care of no business like that.</v>

3298
01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:20.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3299
01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:21.140
<v Speaker 4>Like you know,</v>

3300
01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:24.380
<v Speaker 4>people love coffee and cigarettes that shot at like deal Murray.</v>

3301
01:34:24.381 --> 01:34:25.550
<v Speaker 4>We had risen all of them,</v>

3302
01:34:25.551 --> 01:34:30.551
<v Speaker 4>but the best shot in a coffee shop ever is those fuckers drinking soup at the</v>

3303
01:34:30.951 --> 01:34:31.880
<v Speaker 4>end of this girl.</v>

3304
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:34.040
<v Speaker 4>That's the illest shot.</v>

3305
01:34:34.041 --> 01:34:38.090
<v Speaker 4>I think that the females respect the game like they once did because there are</v>

3306
01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:41.620
<v Speaker 4>hundreds and hundreds of thousands of renegades and out.</v>

3307
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:42.583
<v Speaker 14>Wow.</v>

3308
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:46.220
<v Speaker 4>That's a female working and doesn't have a man.</v>

3309
01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:50.320
<v Speaker 13>Rarely comes into [inaudible].</v>

3310
01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:52.473
<v Speaker 14>Sure.</v>

3311
01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:53.753
<v Speaker 14>First of all,</v>

3312
01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:57.200
<v Speaker 3>hilarious</v>

3313
01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:01.670
<v Speaker 13>is not supposed to be looking at a pimp when a pimp ride by this supposed to be</v>

3314
01:35:01.671 --> 01:35:03.200
<v Speaker 13>looking at the motherfucking curve</v>

3315
01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:06.320
<v Speaker 13>and when she looked up at a pimp,</v>

3316
01:35:06.321 --> 01:35:08.450
<v Speaker 13>she can't be broke for reckless eyeballing.</v>

3317
01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:09.940
<v Speaker 3>Look at this guy chasing him around.</v>

3318
01:35:09.941 --> 01:35:13.560
<v Speaker 3>She can be broke for reckless eyeballing reckless.</v>

3319
01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:20.140
<v Speaker 13>That means that she's making eye contact with the Pippin and she may not even be</v>

3320
01:35:20.451 --> 01:35:21.284
<v Speaker 13>with that man.</v>

3321
01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:23.121
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

3322
01:35:23.121 --> 01:35:24.980
<v Speaker 13>that's the reason why I say the game has changed.</v>

3323
01:35:24.981 --> 01:35:27.080
<v Speaker 13>In the old days she'd be on the pimp arrests.</v>

3324
01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:31.620
<v Speaker 3>What a weird thing to be proud of.</v>

01:35:31.621 --> 01:35:36.621
<v Speaker 3>So you know what a weird thing to be proud of to be a guy who makes women sell</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's something that white guy can't pull off.</v>

3383
01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:01.050
<v Speaker 3>Cv Four.</v>

3384
01:37:01.410 --> 01:37:04.530
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if a white guy did that and then got on one of those special victims</v>

3385
01:37:04.531 --> 01:37:05.364
<v Speaker 3>unit shows</v>

3386
01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:06.951
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

3387
01:37:06.951 --> 01:37:07.111
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3388
01:37:07.111 --> 01:37:08.670
<v Speaker 3>you know the special victim unit shows too.</v>

3389
01:37:08.671 --> 01:37:09.600
<v Speaker 3>They're all about rape,</v>

3390
01:37:10.210 --> 01:37:10.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3391
01:37:10.521 --> 01:37:13.230
<v Speaker 3>so it feels like if he's on that and he says,</v>

3392
01:37:13.231 --> 01:37:17.610
<v Speaker 3>he says he used to sell pussy and he used to sell plus he's not a rape show.</v>

3393
01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:17.881
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3394
01:37:17.881 --> 01:37:19.410
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of a conflict of interest.</v>

3395
01:37:21.690 --> 01:37:23.130
<v Speaker 3>That's just like the bankers,</v>

3396
01:37:23.790 --> 01:37:26.310
<v Speaker 3>the financial lists to the SEC hiring.</v>

3399
01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:30.750
<v Speaker 3>It's basically the same thing.</v>

3400
01:37:30.810 --> 01:37:31.230
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't,</v>

3401
01:37:31.230 --> 01:37:32.430
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't make sense at all.</v>

3402
01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:33.810
<v Speaker 3>Nice to you.</v>

3403

3407
01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:40.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3408
01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:41.880
<v Speaker 3>He's not hurting anybody,</v>

3409
01:37:41.881 --> 01:37:42.750
<v Speaker 3>so no,</v>

3410
01:37:42.751 --> 01:37:43.370
<v Speaker 3>he's not.</v>

3411
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:44.940
<v Speaker 3>In fact keep them off the streets.</v>

3412
01:37:44.941 --> 01:37:45.774
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3413
01:37:46.270 --> 01:37:47.000
<v Speaker 3>A lot of girls.</v>

3414
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:47.833
<v Speaker 3>There he is.</v>

3415
01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:48.713
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

3416
01:37:49.110 --> 01:37:51.480
<v Speaker 3>He's not talking montage.</v>

3417
01:37:51.570 --> 01:37:51.661
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3418
01:37:51.661 --> 01:37:53.800
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be one that hasn't talking five.</v>

3419
01:37:53.801 --> 01:37:54.930
<v Speaker 3>The one cause he's got his hair's in.</v>

3420
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:56.183
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty funny.</v>

3421
01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:57.660
<v Speaker 3>It's weird though.</v>

3422
01:37:57.930 --> 01:37:58.350
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3423
01:37:58.350 --> 01:37:58.860
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

3424
01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:00.540
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird aspect of the black community.</v>

3425
01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:01.980
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist in the white community.</v>

3426
01:38:02.250 --> 01:38:02.581
<v Speaker 3>Like there,</v>

3427
01:38:02.581 --> 01:38:03.690
<v Speaker 3>there wouldn't be like a,</v>

3428
01:38:03.691 --> 01:38:07.140
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of white dudes sitting around talking about the pimp game.</v>

3429
01:38:07.141 --> 01:38:07.974
<v Speaker 3>There's not enough of them.</v>

3430
01:38:08.170 --> 01:38:09.340
<v Speaker 3>You got Mr. White folks.</v>

3431
01:38:09.341 --> 01:38:09.671
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

3432
01:38:09.671 --> 01:38:10.150
<v Speaker 3>it's one,</v>

3433
01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:10.983
<v Speaker 3>one guy.</v>

3434
01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:14.840
<v Speaker 3>I think you probably have two things running,</v>

3435
01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:15.913
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3436
01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:18.283
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3437
01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:18.741
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3438
01:38:18.741 --> 01:38:19.540
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

3439
01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:20.373
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

3440
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:23.150
<v Speaker 3>it's weird that that was not that long ago,</v>

3441
01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:23.931
<v Speaker 3>but I think you'd,</v>

3442
01:38:23.931 --> 01:38:27.500
<v Speaker 3>you'd feel a lot more criticism if you're going to put a movie out,</v>

3443
01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:32.920
<v Speaker 3>sort of a glorifying the life of essentially a criminal who owned slaves.</v>

3444
01:38:33.651 --> 01:38:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Women.</v>

3445
01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:35.173
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3446
01:38:35.210 --> 01:38:35.631
<v Speaker 3>That wouldn't,</v>

3447
01:38:35.631 --> 01:38:36.590
<v Speaker 3>that wouldn't fly today,</v>

3448
01:38:36.591 --> 01:38:37.424
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

3449
01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:42.160
<v Speaker 3>I think people would really complain because all the pimps up hoes down came out</v>

3450
01:38:42.161 --> 01:38:42.994
<v Speaker 3>a long time</v>

3451
01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:44.020
<v Speaker 15>game.</v>

3452
01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:44.391

<v Speaker 3>my mind,</v>

3500
01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:49.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm not high enough to watch that real knowledge.</v>

3501
01:39:49.111 --> 01:39:49.910
<v Speaker 3>You're not ready for it?</v>

3502
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:50.850
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

3503

<v Speaker 3>I need more Alpha brain.</v>

3504
01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm not quite ready for that level.</v>

3505
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:56.830
<v Speaker 3>I had too much off from brain.</v>

3506

<v Speaker 3>to the vortex.</v>

3510
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:07.320
<v Speaker 3>Not as depressing as the hookers and the point series.</v>

3511
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:10.410
<v Speaker 3>That's the most depressing shit or kill a season I showed you last time.</v>

3512
01:40:10.490 --> 01:40:11.323
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:13.733
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3514
01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:16.410
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of those depressing prostitute videos.</v>

3515
01:40:17.190 --> 01:40:18.420
<v Speaker 3>That's some depressing shit.</v>

3516
01:40:18.421 --> 01:40:19.410
<v Speaker 3>Was hookers on the point?</v>

3517
01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:21.730
<v Speaker 3>The where all the cars drive by us?</v>

3518
01:40:21.770 --> 01:40:22.603
<v Speaker 3>It just falls to him.</v>

3519
01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:22.851
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

3520
01:40:22.851 --> 01:40:23.550
<v Speaker 3>The Bronx.</v>

3521
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:23.941
<v Speaker 3>Bronx.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3523
01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:24.421
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3524
01:40:24.421 --> 01:40:26.600
<v Speaker 3>This is apparently one area that's just got point.</v>

3525
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:27.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3526
01:40:27.210 --> 01:40:28.980
<v Speaker 3>it's just got the worst case.</v>

3527
01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:31.830
<v Speaker 3>They have a great farmer's market that's point.</v>

3528
01:40:32.010 --> 01:40:32.850
<v Speaker 3>Fantastic.</v>

3529
01:40:32.851 --> 01:40:33.661
<v Speaker 3>Farmer's market.</v>

3530
01:40:33.661 --> 01:40:35.280
<v Speaker 3>The produce is amazing out there.</v>

3531
01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:38.940
<v Speaker 3>And so did the hookers just come out at night and the farmer's markets done and</v>

3532
01:40:38.941 --> 01:40:41.060
<v Speaker 3>then just the atmosphere changes radically.</v>

3533
01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:41.740
<v Speaker 3>They sell fish,</v>

3534
01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:43.640
<v Speaker 3>then they sell fruit fish.</v>

3535
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:44.740
<v Speaker 3>Then they sell fish.</v>

3536
01:40:45.630 --> 01:40:46.680
<v Speaker 3>Are they still doing that?</v>

3537
01:40:46.681 --> 01:40:47.520
<v Speaker 3>It's a fun Hunt's point.</v>

3538
01:40:47.521 --> 01:40:48.870
<v Speaker 3>Did they clean it up after that show?</v>

3539
01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:50.470
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3540
01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:51.331
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

3541
01:40:51.331 --> 01:40:52.800
<v Speaker 3>I just go for the farmer's market.</v>

3542
01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:53.291

<v Speaker 10>I understand.</v>

3546
01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:55.391
<v Speaker 10>But I mean,</v>

3547
01:40:55.391 --> 01:40:56.560
<v Speaker 10>when you're at the farmer's market,</v>

3548
01:40:56.561 --> 01:40:58.290
<v Speaker 10>do you see like a daytime vampire?</v>

3549
01:40:58.310 --> 01:41:01.070

3552
01:41:07.331 --> 01:41:09.220

<v Speaker 10>I mean I'm allergic to a lot of stuff.</v>

3573
01:41:36.701 --> 01:41:39.550
<v Speaker 10>I actually did this test because I was having trouble on the road and I was</v>

3574
01:41:39.551 --> 01:41:42.040
<v Speaker 10>having stomach issues and I got food poisoning a few times.</v>

3575
01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:42.821
<v Speaker 10>So I did these tests.</v>

3576
01:41:42.821 --> 01:41:44.170
<v Speaker 10>I'm allergic to dairy,</v>

3577

<v Speaker 10>You're allergic to lamb.</v>

3581
01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:50.713

3584
01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:57.070
<v Speaker 10>it's going to affect me regardless.</v>

3593
01:42:05.261 --> 01:42:06.460
<v Speaker 10>Like man boobs,</v>

3594
01:42:06.490 --> 01:42:07.120
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

3595
01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:07.601
<v Speaker 10>Sam,</v>

3596
01:42:07.601 --> 01:42:09.760
<v Speaker 10>the come from eating the wrong foods.</v>

3597
01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:12.400
<v Speaker 10>The allergies can affect you in so many different ways.</v>

3598
01:42:12.401 --> 01:42:14.710
<v Speaker 10>But I'm like highly sensitive to like beef,</v>

3599
01:42:14.711 --> 01:42:15.460
<v Speaker 10>lamb,</v>

3600
01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:16.090
<v Speaker 10>dairy,</v>

3601
01:42:16.090 --> 01:42:16.540
<v Speaker 10>eggs,</v>

3602
01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:17.650
<v Speaker 10>all these weird foods.</v>

3603
01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:20.080
<v Speaker 10>So I've been seeing like this nutritionist,</v>

3604
01:42:20.081 --> 01:42:21.910
<v Speaker 10>I still eat it because I love to cook.</v>

3605
01:42:21.911 --> 01:42:22.744
<v Speaker 10>I love to eat it,</v>

3606
01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:24.640
<v Speaker 10>but it's just about managing it,</v>

3607
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:25.833
<v Speaker 10>you know?</v>

3608
01:42:26.110 --> 01:42:28.510
<v Speaker 10>So what do they know what's happening at rarely?</v>

3609
01:42:28.511 --> 01:42:29.650
<v Speaker 10>I can only have it like,</v>

3610
01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:30.640
<v Speaker 10>like beef or lamb.</v>

3611
01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:31.780
<v Speaker 10>I'll eat once a month now.</v>

3612
01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:33.730
<v Speaker 10>Do they know what the cause of all this stuff is?</v>

3613
01:42:33.731 --> 01:42:34.564
<v Speaker 10>Is this something,</v>

3614
01:42:35.770 --> 01:42:38.170
<v Speaker 10>I'm imagining beef and lamb forever.</v>

3615
01:42:38.171 --> 01:42:38.830
<v Speaker 10>Forever.</v>

3616
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:39.400
<v Speaker 10>Forever.</v>

3617
01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:42.400
<v Speaker 10>Did you feel ill affects of it and that's why you went and get it checked out?</v>

3618
01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:43.780
<v Speaker 10>Did it progressively get worse?</v>

3619
01:42:43.810 --> 01:42:47.080
<v Speaker 10>I've always had like intestinal issues and things like that.</v>

3620
01:42:47.310 --> 01:42:48.820
<v Speaker 10>It's not something that progressively got worse.</v>

3621
01:42:48.821 --> 01:42:50.050
<v Speaker 10>It was something that was always a case.</v>

3622
01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:51.670
<v Speaker 10>It's something that's always the case.</v>

3623
01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:52.181
<v Speaker 10>And then,</v>

3624
01:42:52.181 --> 01:42:53.014
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

3625
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.340
<v Speaker 10>they,</v>

3626
01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:55.810
<v Speaker 10>they can't tell me because they didn't test me before for it.</v>

3627
01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:58.000
<v Speaker 10>Like food allergies is kind of a new thing.</v>

3628
01:42:58.001 --> 01:43:00.160
<v Speaker 10>Like not everybody's gotten tested for food allergies.</v>

3629
01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:02.290
<v Speaker 10>That's something people got to check out.</v>

3630
01:43:02.530 --> 01:43:05.230
<v Speaker 10>But do you think it got worse after you were became a chef?</v>

3631
01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:06.491
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

3632
01:43:06.491 --> 01:43:08.260
<v Speaker 10>I definitely more weird shit,</v>

3633
01:43:08.261 --> 01:43:08.440
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

3634
01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.510
<v Speaker 10>I definitely felt worse than my stomach.</v>

3635
01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:10.931
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

3636
01:43:10.931 --> 01:43:12.220
<v Speaker 10>I was farting all over the place.</v>

3637
01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:12.911
<v Speaker 10>Like my friends.</v>

3638
01:43:12.911 --> 01:43:14.950
<v Speaker 10>Like you sound like a fucking machine gun.</v>

3639
01:43:15.230 --> 01:43:16.450
<v Speaker 10>It's just a walking farm.</v>

3640
01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:19.300
<v Speaker 10>That's crazy that you're allergic to beef and lamb.</v>

3641
01:43:20.230 --> 01:43:21.160
<v Speaker 10>Weird things.</v>

3642
01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:22.420
<v Speaker 10>My eyes get irritated.</v>

3643
01:43:22.421 --> 01:43:23.290
<v Speaker 10>It's kind of crazy.</v>

3644
01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:25.750
<v Speaker 10>There's a such weird things to be a,</v>

3645
01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:30.280
<v Speaker 10>how is it to go around the world doing a cooking show if you can't eat like the</v>

3646
01:43:30.281 --> 01:43:31.060
<v Speaker 10>two most?</v>

3647
01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:31.211
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

3648
01:43:31.211 --> 01:43:31.551
<v Speaker 10>he's still,</v>

3649
01:43:31.551 --> 01:43:31.691
<v Speaker 10>he,</v>

3650
01:43:31.691 --> 01:43:34.600
<v Speaker 10>I just eat it and I take those supplements.</v>

3651
01:43:34.710 --> 01:43:36.430
<v Speaker 10>And what are the settlements that help you?</v>

3652
01:43:36.431 --> 01:43:37.900
<v Speaker 10>Do you take the adjustive enzymes?</v>

3653
01:43:37.930 --> 01:43:40.510
<v Speaker 10>I take a og wash route.</v>

3654
01:43:40.511 --> 01:43:41.770
<v Speaker 10>There's something like hogwash route.</v>

3655
01:43:41.771 --> 01:43:45.250
<v Speaker 10>There's grape seed extract and methyl assists probiotics.</v>

3656
01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:45.970
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

3657
01:43:45.970 --> 01:43:49.390
<v Speaker 10>and then the thing is when I'm not doing the shows and I'm not researching</v>

3658
01:43:49.391 --> 01:43:49.870
<v Speaker 10>foods,</v>

3659
01:43:49.870 --> 01:43:51.160
<v Speaker 10>I keep it really clean.</v>

3660
01:43:51.230 --> 01:43:51.650
<v Speaker 10>Right.</v>

3661
01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:55.240
<v Speaker 10>So what does your diet consist of then when you're saying you can eat greens?</v>

3662
01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:56.130
<v Speaker 10>I eat seafood.</v>

3663
01:43:56.150 --> 01:43:57.320
<v Speaker 10>I can eat pork and chicken.</v>

3664
01:43:57.710 --> 01:43:58.920
<v Speaker 10>So chickens too.</v>

3665
01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.780
<v Speaker 10>Hmm.</v>

3666
01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:00.561
<v Speaker 10>That's fascinating.</v>

3667
01:44:00.561 --> 01:44:01.311
<v Speaker 10>Lamb and beat.</v>

3668
01:44:01.311 --> 01:44:02.180
<v Speaker 10>What about venison,</v>

3669
01:44:02.210 --> 01:44:02.571
<v Speaker 10>elk,</v>

3670
01:44:02.571 --> 01:44:03.530
<v Speaker 10>things along those lines?</v>

3671
01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:04.170
<v Speaker 10>I'm not sure.</v>

3672
01:44:04.170 --> 01:44:05.420
<v Speaker 10>They didn't test me for that,</v>

3673
01:44:05.630 --> 01:44:07.100
<v Speaker 10>so I got to figure it out,</v>

3674
01:44:07.101 --> 01:44:08.690
<v Speaker 10>but no food allergies is real.</v>

3675
01:44:08.890 --> 01:44:10.450
<v Speaker 5>How did you become a chef?</v>

3676
01:44:10.451 --> 01:44:11.560
<v Speaker 5>If every time you eat</v>

3677
01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:12.610
<v Speaker 10>fucking,</v>

3678
01:44:12.610 --> 01:44:13.750
<v Speaker 10>you're starting up a storm.</v>

3679
01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:14.020
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

3680
01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:16.030
<v Speaker 10>I followed it up with so I think it was just how it was.</v>

3681
01:44:16.031 --> 01:44:17.530
<v Speaker 10>A kid used to sign my yearbook,</v>

3682
01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:18.393
<v Speaker 10>this one kid,</v>

3683
01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:20.740
<v Speaker 10>because I had so much like sinus issues.</v>

3684
01:44:21.070 --> 01:44:21.701
<v Speaker 10>He was like,</v>

3685
01:44:21.701 --> 01:44:24.040
<v Speaker 10>and I farted all the time and I always needed to poop.</v>

3686
01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:24.641
<v Speaker 10>He was like,</v>

3687
01:44:24.641 --> 01:44:25.780
<v Speaker 10>life is a highway,</v>

3688
01:44:25.930 --> 01:44:26.890
<v Speaker 10>bring tissues.</v>

3689
01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:30.280
<v Speaker 10>He signed my yearbook that way in like sixth grade.</v>

3690
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:31.810
<v Speaker 10>That's funny man.</v>

3691
01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:34.600
<v Speaker 10>What a weird circumstance to be found in.</v>

3692
01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:38.740
<v Speaker 10>Did they have any reason why they believe that you got allergic to all these</v>

3693
01:44:38.741 --> 01:44:38.951
<v Speaker 10>things?</v>

3694
01:44:38.951 --> 01:44:40.540
<v Speaker 10>Like when they find out food allergies,</v>

3695
01:44:40.541 --> 01:44:41.920
<v Speaker 10>do they have a source for these?</v>

3696
01:44:41.921 --> 01:44:42.850
<v Speaker 10>Is it genetic?</v>

3697
01:44:42.851 --> 01:44:44.200
<v Speaker 10>Is it genetic?</v>

3698
01:44:44.201 --> 01:44:45.760
<v Speaker 10>I think for me it's genetic.</v>

3699
01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:46.960
<v Speaker 10>You're family has the same issues.</v>

01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:48.730
<v Speaker 10>My mom has a lot of the same issues.</v>

3701
01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:49.281
<v Speaker 10>No.</v>

3702
01:44:49.281 --> 01:44:52.510
<v Speaker 10>I had also the weirdest thing I had developed in Mongolia.</v>

3703
01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:53.350
<v Speaker 10>Right.</v>

3704
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:58.350
<v Speaker 10>I got sick in Mongolia and I had to take antibiotics to like flush my system</v>

3705
01:44:59.351 --> 01:45:00.184
<v Speaker 10>out.</v>

3706
01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:04.210
<v Speaker 10>I got back to America and went to see this doctor and he's like,</v>

3707
01:45:04.211 --> 01:45:04.780
<v Speaker 10>dude,</v>

3708
01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:06.190
<v Speaker 10>you got a yeast infection.</v>

3709
01:45:06.191 --> 01:45:06.401
<v Speaker 10>I was like,</v>

3710
01:45:06.401 --> 01:45:08.740
<v Speaker 10>I thought I needed a vagina to have a yeast infection.</v>

3711
01:45:08.741 --> 01:45:08.981
<v Speaker 10>He's like,</v>

3712
01:45:08.981 --> 01:45:09.131
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

3713
01:45:09.131 --> 01:45:12.570
<v Speaker 10>you have a yeast infection in your stomach and you cleaned it out.</v>

3714
01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:17.580
<v Speaker 10>Antibiotics and the bad bacteria got in before the good bacteria can be the yes.</v>

3715
01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:18.850
<v Speaker 10>Yet you had it too.</v>

3716
01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:20.133
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

3717
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:23.080

01:45:24.101 --> 01:45:25.210
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have a yeast infection.</v>

3721
01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:27.400

01:45:27.410 --> 01:45:31.690
<v Speaker 5>is like everyone has candida because I have every symptom of it,</v>

01:47:57.991 --> 01:47:58.561
<v Speaker 10>solid,</v>

3838
01:47:58.561 --> 01:47:59.071
<v Speaker 10>solid,</v>

3839
01:47:59.071 --> 01:47:59.904
<v Speaker 10>strong.</v>

3840
01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:06.030
<v Speaker 10>The thing either was that horse,</v>

3841
01:48:06.110 --> 01:48:07.170
<v Speaker 10>did you eat horse?</v>

3842
01:48:07.250 --> 01:48:09.480
<v Speaker 10>I I drank fermented horses.</v>

3843
01:48:09.481 --> 01:48:13.470
<v Speaker 10>Milk with the nastiest thing was that's the alcoholic beverage.</v>

3844
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:17.950
<v Speaker 10>Fermented Marysville ferments and horses and milk might be another thing.</v>

3845
01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:20.620
<v Speaker 10>Fermented Mare's milk.</v>

3846
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:26.750
<v Speaker 10>That's what the Mongols Seamus and it clears your system out too.</v>

3847
01:48:27.570 --> 01:48:28.860
<v Speaker 10>It's like it detoxes you.</v>

3848
01:48:28.861 --> 01:48:30.810
<v Speaker 10>If it's your first time drinking it really,</v>

3849
01:48:30.811 --> 01:48:31.430
<v Speaker 10>you don't clear you.</v>

3850
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:32.041
<v Speaker 10>I want to go,</v>

3851
01:48:32.041 --> 01:48:32.641
<v Speaker 10>I want to do that.</v>

3852
01:48:32.641 --> 01:48:33.610
<v Speaker 10>How does it detox?</v>

3853
01:48:33.611 --> 01:48:36.150
<v Speaker 10>The tastes like shit or that's what they tell you it,</v>

3854
01:48:36.330 --> 01:48:37.560
<v Speaker 10>it doesn't taste all right.</v>

3855
01:48:37.770 --> 01:48:39.330
<v Speaker 10>It sounds like it's going to taste bad,</v>

3856
01:48:39.331 --> 01:48:40.170
<v Speaker 10>but it doesn't taste bad.</v>

3857
01:48:40.290 --> 01:48:41.123
<v Speaker 10>It is.</v>

3858
01:48:41.250 --> 01:48:45.420
<v Speaker 10>It does feel like on clarifying shocker,</v>

3859
01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:48.060
<v Speaker 10>it feels like you're inside a horses ass.</v>

3860
01:48:48.061 --> 01:48:49.200
<v Speaker 10>But in a sweet way</v>

3861
01:48:51.390 --> 01:48:53.110
<v Speaker 10>cause it's like I can't picture,</v>

3862
01:48:55.050 --> 01:48:59.340
<v Speaker 10>you can't get around it that it's the fermented essence of this animal and that</v>

3863
01:48:59.370 --> 01:49:00.240
<v Speaker 10>bothers you at first,</v>

3864
01:49:00.241 --> 01:49:00.750
<v Speaker 10>but then you're like,</v>

3865
01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:01.980
<v Speaker 10>it's kind of sweet.</v>

3866
01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:04.620
<v Speaker 10>It has a sweet and like delicate flavor.</v>

3867
01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:06.300
<v Speaker 10>It tastes like a horse.</v>

3868
01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:07.630
<v Speaker 10>It tastes like a fucking horse.</v>

3869
01:49:07.850 --> 01:49:12.850
<v Speaker 10>[inaudible] would sell if you brought it back to the horse with rapt and honey.</v>

3870
01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.670
<v Speaker 10>That's what it looks like in that bottle.</v>

3871
01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:16.920
<v Speaker 10>The white bottle that's up there.</v>

3872
01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:17.760
<v Speaker 10>That's what it looked like.</v>

3873
01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:18.221
<v Speaker 10>Oh No,</v>

3874
01:49:18.221 --> 01:49:18.431

01:49:18.581 --> 01:49:18.721
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

3877
01:49:18.721 --> 01:49:18.961
<v Speaker 10>no.</v>

3878
01:49:18.961 --> 01:49:20.910
<v Speaker 10>Like a fermented Mare's milk.</v>

3879
01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:22.393
<v Speaker 10>Mare's milk.</v>

3880
01:49:22.530 --> 01:49:26.270
<v Speaker 10>Like they had it in a wooden bucket and they'd just ladle it into bowls.</v>

3881
01:49:26.290 --> 01:49:27.270
<v Speaker 10>They just let it rot.</v>

3882
01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:29.730
<v Speaker 10>There was pieces of Hay in it.</v>

3883
01:49:29.770 --> 01:49:30.101
<v Speaker 10>All right,</v>

3884

3886
01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:38.100
<v Speaker 10>That was actually good in a clean v out.</v>

3887
01:49:38.190 --> 01:49:39.630
<v Speaker 10>But she makes you shit.</v>

<v Speaker 10>Lamb chop makes you shit.</v>

3894
01:49:48.510 --> 01:49:49.150
<v Speaker 2>Porosity.</v>

3895
01:49:49.150 --> 01:49:50.290
<v Speaker 2>This was explosive.</v>

3896
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:51.500

3902
01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that this would be something that could be successfully bottled and</v>

<v Speaker 5>And then the,</v>

3961
01:51:37.340 --> 01:51:39.290
<v Speaker 5>the last one is this part of Japan,</v>

3962

3965
01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:43.993
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>

3966
01:51:44.090 --> 01:51:44.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3967
01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:45.980
<v Speaker 5>they all drink booze,</v>

3968
01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:47.581
<v Speaker 5>they and,</v>

3970
01:51:49.431 --> 01:51:51.370
<v Speaker 5>and the one thing is consistency of that.</v>

3971
01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:53.540
<v Speaker 5>They paid basically the same thing every day.</v>

3972
01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:54.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3973

<v Speaker 2>you have a liver.</v>

3974
01:51:55.710 --> 01:51:57.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean liver can process booze.</v>

3975
01:51:57.870 --> 01:51:59.610
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of how much booze you're drinking.</v>

3976
01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:00.660
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we're talking.</v>

3977
01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:04.890
<v Speaker 2>I seen some of those studies.</v>

3978
01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:07.960
<v Speaker 2>I figure it's the happiness factor and the like.</v>

3979
01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:10.150
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

3980
01:52:10.150 --> 01:52:10.983
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3981
01:52:11.090 --> 01:52:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3982
01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:15.390
<v Speaker 2>I think that stress is probably the killer way worse than almost anything else</v>

3983
01:52:15.391 --> 01:52:15.730
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

3984
01:52:15.730 --> 01:52:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Killer.</v>

3985
01:52:16.450 --> 01:52:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Especially like real stress like this.</v>

3986
01:52:18.031 --> 01:52:19.080
<v Speaker 2>People that can't go to bed at night,</v>

3987
01:52:19.081 --> 01:52:21.480
<v Speaker 2>they get home from work and they're fucking a wire to the gills.</v>

3988
01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Thinking about the office and all the things they have to get done and all the</v>

3989
01:52:24.301 --> 01:52:26.400
<v Speaker 2>competition and the social politics that are playing on.</v>

3990
01:52:26.690 --> 01:52:28.920
<v Speaker 2>And then they sleep for a couple hours and they get up and they're fucked up.</v>

3991
01:52:28.921 --> 01:52:30.900
<v Speaker 2>So they take a pill and then they fucking keep going.</v>

01:56:02.611 --> 01:56:03.211
<v Speaker 5>but I just,</v>

4122
01:56:03.211 --> 01:56:03.540
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4123
01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:08.540
<v Speaker 5>we just finished it and it's fucked up during the Cold War.</v>

4124
01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:09.773
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4125
01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:11.753
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4126
01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:13.740
<v Speaker 5>right after sort of,</v>

4127
01:56:13.741 --> 01:56:13.921
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4128
01:56:13.921 --> 01:56:14.400
<v Speaker 5>the first,</v>

4129
01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:17.000
<v Speaker 5>the first bomb of 45 that we started testing them and,</v>

4130
01:56:17.001 --> 01:56:17.834
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

4131
01:56:17.950 --> 01:56:18.691
<v Speaker 5>what does it do?</v>

4132
01:56:18.691 --> 01:56:19.524
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4133
01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:20.910
<v Speaker 5>and so during the Cold War,</v>

4134
01:56:20.911 --> 01:56:23.310
<v Speaker 5>we had testing rounds in Nevada and all this shit.</v>

4135
01:56:23.850 --> 01:56:26.520
<v Speaker 5>The Soviets were doing these air,</v>

4136
01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:27.660
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4137
01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:29.090
<v Speaker 5>tests,</v>

4138
01:56:29.090 --> 01:56:29.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4139
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.821
<v Speaker 5>to test,</v>

4140
01:56:29.821 --> 01:56:30.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4141
01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:31.293
<v Speaker 5>air bursts.</v>

4142
01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:34.510
<v Speaker 5>And they did it in a place called the [inaudible],</v>

4143
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:36.360
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4144
01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:37.650
<v Speaker 5>testing polygon,</v>

4145
01:56:38.370 --> 01:56:40.140
<v Speaker 5>otherwise known as the polygon.</v>

4146
01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:41.393
<v Speaker 5>And in,</v>

4147
01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:45.030
<v Speaker 5>it was about an area that was inhabited by about 2 million people.</v>

4148
01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:48.990
<v Speaker 5>And so what happened is the majority,</v>

4149
01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:53.550
<v Speaker 5>we went there and we checked out the land and it was still a radiated.</v>

4150
01:56:53.551 --> 01:56:54.660
<v Speaker 5>Like 40 years later.</v>

4151
01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:55.440
<v Speaker 5>And it was,</v>

4152
01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:59.490
<v Speaker 5>I think the thing is like having five cat scans and hour 24 hours a day for the</v>

4153
01:56:59.491 --> 01:57:00.324
<v Speaker 5>rest of your life.</v>

4154
01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:01.890
<v Speaker 5>So all of these,</v>

4155
01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:05.820
<v Speaker 5>all of these towns around the polygon have these mutants,</v>

4156
01:57:05.850 --> 01:57:06.683
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4157
01:57:06.930 --> 01:57:08.620
<v Speaker 5>And like crazy mutants.</v>

4158
01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:13.620
<v Speaker 5>Like the scary thing about it actually is they had a whole orphanage of mutants</v>

4159
01:57:13.621 --> 01:57:15.930
<v Speaker 5>that looked exactly like the mutans from Akira.</v>

4160
01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:18.570
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe that's why they do or care of that way,</v>

4161
01:57:18.571 --> 01:57:21.780
<v Speaker 5>but like it was literally like a classic Comic Book Or Textbook,</v>

4162
01:57:21.781 --> 01:57:23.640
<v Speaker 5>like mutant and you're like,</v>

4163
01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:25.710
<v Speaker 5>it was scary because of that.</v>

4164
01:57:25.711 --> 01:57:26.521
<v Speaker 5>Like it wasn't like a,</v>

4165
01:57:26.521 --> 01:57:27.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4166
01:57:27.210 --> 01:57:29.310
<v Speaker 5>it was a tumor here or whatever.</v>

4167
01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:33.600
<v Speaker 5>It was like these babies with these huge heads with veins and them and shit and,</v>

4168
01:57:33.601 --> 01:57:33.991
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

4169
01:57:33.991 --> 01:57:35.310
<v Speaker 5>and not just one like,</v>

4170
01:57:35.370 --> 01:57:35.671
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4171
01:57:35.671 --> 01:57:36.870
<v Speaker 5>a whole orphanage full of them.</v>

4172
01:57:37.050 --> 01:57:39.240
<v Speaker 5>There was this one guy who had his whole,</v>

4173
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:39.690
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4174
01:57:39.690 --> 01:57:40.110
<v Speaker 5>sort of,</v>

4175
01:57:40.110 --> 01:57:40.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4176
01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:41.760
<v Speaker 5>all of his skin was like,</v>

4177
01:57:41.761 --> 01:57:45.580
<v Speaker 5>sort of looked like it was melting off was all tumors and you know,</v>

4178
01:57:45.581 --> 01:57:46.980
<v Speaker 5>that they have so many,</v>

4179
01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:49.100
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4180
01:57:49.170 --> 01:57:50.760
<v Speaker 5>and this is three generations in.</v>

4181
01:57:50.761 --> 01:57:51.241
<v Speaker 5>So they're like,</v>

4182
01:57:51.241 --> 01:57:51.820
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4183
01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:52.690
<v Speaker 5>what is this guy?</v>

4184
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.760
<v Speaker 5>Not The guy.</v>

4185
01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:54.530
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the guys.</v>

4186
01:57:54.530 --> 01:57:55.363
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4187
01:57:55.620 --> 01:57:56.453
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

4188
01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:58.050
<v Speaker 5>That's sad man.</v>

4189
01:57:58.080 --> 01:57:58.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4190
01:57:58.380 --> 01:57:58.681
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

4191
01:57:58.681 --> 01:57:58.890
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

4192
01:57:58.890 --> 01:57:59.331
<v Speaker 5>but anyways,</v>

4193
01:57:59.331 --> 01:58:00.360
<v Speaker 5>so what's happening now,</v>

4194
01:58:00.361 --> 01:58:02.130
<v Speaker 5>it's quite interesting because it's the x men,</v>

4195
01:58:02.131 --> 01:58:06.690
<v Speaker 5>but in real life is what's happening is the people from the Polygon,</v>

4196
01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:10.350
<v Speaker 5>I've gone into like other cities and stuff and their human genetics,</v>

4197
01:58:10.351 --> 01:58:12.060
<v Speaker 5>like their genome has been,</v>

4198
01:58:12.210 --> 01:58:12.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4199
01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:15.780
<v Speaker 5>re configured by the radiation poisoning,</v>

4200
01:58:16.110 --> 01:58:18.900
<v Speaker 5>but they're passing it on sort of generation to generation.</v>

4201
01:58:18.901 --> 01:58:22.740
<v Speaker 5>So their kids and their kids' kids have these same sort of genetic disorders,</v>

4202
01:58:22.741 --> 01:58:23.760
<v Speaker 5>rare birth defects,</v>

4203
01:58:23.761 --> 01:58:24.211
<v Speaker 5>cancers,</v>

4204
01:58:24.211 --> 01:58:24.601
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera,</v>

4205
01:58:24.601 --> 01:58:25.434
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

4206
01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:29.370
<v Speaker 5>And so what they've started to argue for is that the issuance of a genetic</v>

4207
01:58:29.371 --> 01:58:30.204
<v Speaker 5>passport,</v>

4208
01:58:30.630 --> 01:58:35.630
<v Speaker 5>which registers your mutations and your human genes in your genome and the,</v>

4209
01:58:37.290 --> 01:58:37.531
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4210
01:58:37.531 --> 01:58:41.040
<v Speaker 5>the obvious sort of extension of that is why you fucking giving them a genetic</v>

4211
01:58:41.650 --> 01:58:45.190
<v Speaker 5>if you don't want them to procreate because you don't want them to procreate to</v>

4212
01:58:45.191 --> 01:58:47.110
<v Speaker 5>then pass on the mutated genome.</v>

4213
01:58:47.530 --> 01:58:51.070
<v Speaker 5>So it's this whole mute and versus norm kind of x men,</v>

4214
01:58:51.071 --> 01:58:52.120
<v Speaker 5>but in real life.</v>

4215
01:58:52.330 --> 01:58:52.781
<v Speaker 5>And you go,</v>

4216
01:58:52.781 --> 01:58:53.081
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

4217
01:58:53.081 --> 01:58:54.250
<v Speaker 5>that's Nazi-ism,</v>

4218
01:58:54.251 --> 01:58:55.450
<v Speaker 5>that's fucking eugenics.</v>

4219
01:58:55.451 --> 01:58:56.650
<v Speaker 5>That's fuck you that can't be,</v>

4220
01:58:56.860 --> 01:59:01.860
<v Speaker 5>and then you go and see the genetics that are been passed along and you're like,</v>

4221
01:59:02.590 --> 01:59:02.861
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4222
01:59:02.861 --> 01:59:04.540
<v Speaker 5>this is some serious fucking shit.</v>

4223
01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:04.790
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

4224
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:05.800
<v Speaker 5>we did some.</v>

4225
01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:06.551
<v Speaker 5>And when I said,</v>

4226
01:59:06.551 --> 01:59:07.930
<v Speaker 5>we don't understand the technology,</v>

4227
01:59:07.931 --> 01:59:09.550
<v Speaker 5>obviously we don't understand the power of it.</v>

4228
01:59:09.790 --> 01:59:11.320
<v Speaker 5>We don't understand how to store it.</v>

4229
01:59:11.321 --> 01:59:14.110
<v Speaker 5>We don't understand how to make it without fucking melting down.</v>

4230
01:59:14.110 --> 01:59:16.870
<v Speaker 5>Fukushima's fucking irradiating fish in la.</v>

4231
01:59:16.871 --> 01:59:17.740
<v Speaker 5>Like it's crazy.</v>

4232
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:22.510
<v Speaker 5>But when you talk about genetics and how genetics get affected,</v>

4233
01:59:22.630 --> 01:59:24.730
<v Speaker 5>you just get to the fucking tip of the iceberg.</v>

4234
01:59:24.731 --> 01:59:25.421
<v Speaker 5>I want shit,</v>

4235
01:59:25.421 --> 01:59:26.254
<v Speaker 5>we're fucking up.</v>

4236
01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:30.250
<v Speaker 5>And so when you see these people who are being issued by with genetic passports</v>

4237
01:59:30.251 --> 01:59:31.084
<v Speaker 5>to like you,</v>

4238
01:59:31.210 --> 01:59:31.601
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4239
01:59:31.601 --> 01:59:32.530
<v Speaker 5>for procreation,</v>

4240
01:59:32.531 --> 01:59:32.981
<v Speaker 5>for all these things,</v>

4241
01:59:32.981 --> 01:59:34.480
<v Speaker 5>because their genome is fucked up.</v>

4242
01:59:34.481 --> 01:59:34.751
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

4243
01:59:34.751 --> 01:59:36.310
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck we made that?</v>

4244
01:59:36.311 --> 01:59:37.000
<v Speaker 5>We did that.</v>

4245
01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.550
<v Speaker 5>We created this shit that fucks up our genetics.</v>

4246
01:59:39.580 --> 01:59:41.210
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy how bad his Fukushima</v>

4247
01:59:43.220 --> 01:59:44.053
<v Speaker 5>very bad.</v>

4248
01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:45.150
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

4249
01:59:45.150 --> 01:59:45.761
<v Speaker 5>like what,</v>

4250
01:59:45.761 --> 01:59:46.511
<v Speaker 5>what it shows,</v>

4251
01:59:46.511 --> 01:59:47.830
<v Speaker 5>what's interesting about it is,</v>

4252
01:59:47.831 --> 01:59:49.390
<v Speaker 5>so when sandy hit New York,</v>

4253
01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.341
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4254
01:59:50.341 --> 01:59:50.560
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4255
01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:53.200
<v Speaker 5>there's the 14th street power plant that,</v>

4256
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.770
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

4257
01:59:53.770 --> 01:59:54.270
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

4258
01:59:54.270 --> 01:59:54.700
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

4259
01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:55.900
<v Speaker 5>that got knocked out.</v>

4260
01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:57.190
<v Speaker 5>And it was like,</v>

4261
01:59:57.191 --> 02:00:00.100
<v Speaker 5>we have an 18 foot Floodwall like 18 feet,</v>

4262
02:00:00.101 --> 02:00:00.550
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

4263
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:02.220
<v Speaker 5>but what if the water comes over it?</v>

4264
02:00:02.290 --> 02:00:02.921
<v Speaker 5>But it can.</v>

4265
02:00:02.921 --> 02:00:03.754
<v Speaker 5>It's 18 feet.</v>

4266
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:04.570
<v Speaker 5>But what if it comes up?</v>

4267
02:00:04.570 --> 02:00:04.811
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4268
02:00:04.811 --> 02:00:06.220
<v Speaker 5>it will short out and we'll be fucked him.</v>

4269
02:00:06.221 --> 02:00:09.370
<v Speaker 5>There'll be no energy in fucking New York for that live on 14th street.</v>

4270
02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:10.333
<v Speaker 5>It happened</v>

4271
02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:15.340
<v Speaker 5>and the thing is,</v>

4272
02:00:15.390 --> 02:00:16.330
<v Speaker 5>and you sit there and you say,</v>

4273
02:00:16.331 --> 02:00:17.110
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4274
02:00:17.110 --> 02:00:20.260
<v Speaker 5>but they're just incredulous because it can never go over the flood wall.</v>

4275
02:00:20.290 --> 02:00:21.980
<v Speaker 5>And then of course it did go to the flood wall,</v>

4276
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:22.481
<v Speaker 5>blew up,</v>

4277
02:00:22.481 --> 02:00:23.380
<v Speaker 5>and then you'd fucking,</v>

4278
02:00:23.410 --> 02:00:24.250
<v Speaker 5>you have no power.</v>

4279
02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:26.110
<v Speaker 5>If you look at Fukushima,</v>

4280
02:00:26.111 --> 02:00:31.111
<v Speaker 5>it's a perfect example of the problem with nuclear power is that okay,</v>

4281
02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:33.970
<v Speaker 5>it's no way the fucking seat can come up here.</v>

4282
02:00:33.971 --> 02:00:35.160
<v Speaker 5>The sea can not come up.</v>

4283
02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:36.460
<v Speaker 5>It just can't get here.</v>

4284
02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:37.713
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>

4285
02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:38.980
<v Speaker 5>There's a fucking tsunami.</v>

4286
02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:40.840
<v Speaker 5>It comes up and it's fucking,</v>

4287
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:41.650
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

4288
02:00:41.650 --> 02:00:42.130
<v Speaker 5>Now the,</v>

4289
02:00:42.130 --> 02:00:42.900
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4290
02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:47.260
<v Speaker 5>the level of the levels of radiation have not fucking gone and they're still</v>

4291
02:00:47.261 --> 02:00:47.470
<v Speaker 5>worth,</v>

4292
02:00:47.470 --> 02:00:48.850
<v Speaker 5>we have a crew there shooting right now.</v>

4293
02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.910
<v Speaker 5>The levels of radiation in the area are through the fucking roof,</v>

4294
02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:56.320
<v Speaker 5>the levels of radiation now that go out and sort of concentric circles.</v>

4295
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:58.300
<v Speaker 5>I think there's been some reports.</v>

4296
02:00:58.301 --> 02:00:58.891
<v Speaker 5>Now again,</v>

4297
02:00:58.891 --> 02:01:00.400
<v Speaker 5>I haven't verified these reports.</v>

4298
02:01:00.430 --> 02:01:02.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go on the record of you know,</v>

4299
02:01:02.561 --> 02:01:03.150
<v Speaker 5>fish,</v>

4300
02:01:03.150 --> 02:01:04.370
<v Speaker 5>you know here that are fully,</v>

4301
02:01:04.371 --> 02:01:06.250
<v Speaker 5>you were radiated from Fukushima and you're like,</v>

4302
02:01:06.251 --> 02:01:07.084
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4303
02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:09.550
<v Speaker 5>how much worse do we need it to be?</v>

4304
02:01:09.850 --> 02:01:14.850
<v Speaker 5>That's why you taking the spent fuel rods and things becomes an issue because we</v>

4305
02:01:14.861 --> 02:01:16.490
<v Speaker 5>can't go forward with the,</v>

4306
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.841
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4307
02:01:16.841 --> 02:01:17.081
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4308
02:01:17.081 --> 02:01:17.621
<v Speaker 5>the current,</v>

4309
02:01:17.621 --> 02:01:19.000
<v Speaker 5>the technology as it is.</v>

4310
02:01:19.450 --> 02:01:22.720
<v Speaker 5>And so that's why if you take the spent fuel and at least can do something with</v>

4311
02:01:22.721 --> 02:01:26.510
<v Speaker 5>it rather than just let it fucking irradiate for the next 10,000 and this has</v>

4312
02:01:26.511 --> 02:01:27.191
<v Speaker 5>all been proven,</v>

4313
02:01:27.191 --> 02:01:28.024
<v Speaker 5>this kid's theories,</v>

4314
02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:29.980
<v Speaker 5>you reusing splat fields?</v>

4315
02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:30.833
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

4316
02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:31.511
<v Speaker 5>not that.</v>

4317
02:01:31.511 --> 02:01:31.940
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

4318
02:01:31.940 --> 02:01:32.621
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they have,</v>

4319
02:01:32.621 --> 02:01:33.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

4320
02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:34.660
<v Speaker 5>I just saw a speech and I was,</v>

4321
02:01:34.690 --> 02:01:35.021
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4322
02:01:35.021 --> 02:01:36.250
<v Speaker 5>I'd had a few drinks and I'm like,</v>

4323
02:01:36.251 --> 02:01:37.084
<v Speaker 5>I'm crying.</v>

4324
02:01:37.810 --> 02:01:39.040
<v Speaker 5>This guy is going to save my,</v>

4325
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:40.843
<v Speaker 2>I love you.</v>

4326
02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:42.640
<v Speaker 2>17 year old boy with a bowl cut.</v>

4327
02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:46.150
<v Speaker 2>I did see a piece on the fish on a tune,</v>

4328
02:01:46.151 --> 02:01:49.040
<v Speaker 2>it's being 3% more irradiated than ever before.</v>

4329
02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:50.321
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

4330
02:01:50.321 --> 02:01:51.230
<v Speaker 2>that's a big number.</v>

4331
02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:54.760
<v Speaker 2>3% after a couple of years when you do something that's going to be irradiating</v>

4332
02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:57.770
<v Speaker 2>the ocean for hundreds of thousands of years if it keeps leaking.</v>

4333
02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4334
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:58.491
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4335
02:01:58.491 --> 02:01:59.170
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

4336
02:01:59.170 --> 02:01:59.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4337
02:01:59.580 --> 02:01:59.821
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

4338
02:01:59.821 --> 02:02:02.900
<v Speaker 2>that thing that they're doing to where they're trying to make the structure to</v>

4339
02:02:02.901 --> 02:02:05.180
<v Speaker 2>keep all the water in all the radiated water.</v>

4340
02:02:05.210 --> 02:02:05.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4341
02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:08.600
<v Speaker 2>And they're going to keep it in with ice wall so they didn't have to keep it</v>

4342
02:02:08.601 --> 02:02:09.171
<v Speaker 2>frozen.</v>

4343
02:02:09.171 --> 02:02:12.980
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of stories now coming out to the Japanese government,</v>

4344
02:02:13.010 --> 02:02:13.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4345
02:02:13.251 --> 02:02:16.430
<v Speaker 2>kept it under wraps and didn't want to tell anybody in the food,</v>

4346
02:02:16.450 --> 02:02:16.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4347
02:02:16.761 --> 02:02:21.020
<v Speaker 2>around in the whole region was a radiated people in Tokyo we're showing,</v>

4348
02:02:21.021 --> 02:02:21.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4349
02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:23.270
<v Speaker 2>in increased,</v>

4350
02:02:23.271 --> 02:02:23.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4351
02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:23.991
<v Speaker 2>signs,</v>

4352
02:02:23.991 --> 02:02:24.321
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

4353
02:02:24.321 --> 02:02:25.040
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

4354
02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:25.701
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

4355
02:02:25.701 --> 02:02:26.360
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4356
02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:27.193
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4357
02:02:27.950 --> 02:02:28.590
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4358
02:02:28.590 --> 02:02:30.500
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be bad for quite some time.</v>

4359
02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:35.210
<v Speaker 2>What do you expect him and how the fuck are they ever going to stop it?</v>

4360
02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:35.671
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

4361
02:02:35.671 --> 02:02:35.881
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4362
02:02:35.881 --> 02:02:38.270
<v Speaker 2>it's the rest of the world going to join in and help Japan.</v>

4363
02:02:38.271 --> 02:02:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Are they still leaving it up to Japan?</v>

4364
02:02:40.050 --> 02:02:40.760
<v Speaker 2>Like what's,</v>

4365
02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:41.593
<v Speaker 2>I think if you look,</v>

4366
02:02:41.790 --> 02:02:43.370
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at environmental things,</v>

4367
02:02:43.371 --> 02:02:45.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean now it's become such as this,</v>

4368
02:02:45.111 --> 02:02:45.560
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

4369
02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:46.100
<v Speaker 2>what's this?</v>

4370
02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:46.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4371
02:02:46.251 --> 02:02:47.240
<v Speaker 2>That's not real though,</v>

4372
02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:47.781
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

4373
02:02:47.781 --> 02:02:48.020
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

4374
02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:48.853
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

4375
02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:49.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4376
02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:49.601
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

4377
02:02:49.601 --> 02:02:51.200
<v Speaker 2>that's that's not what that represents.</v>

4378
02:02:51.201 --> 02:02:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't wrapper represent radiation?</v>

4379
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:56.210
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have mistakenly posted that things.</v>

4380
02:02:56.300 --> 02:02:57.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is,</v>

4381
02:02:57.231 --> 02:02:58.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's not radiation.</v>

4382
02:02:58.401 --> 02:02:59.690
<v Speaker 2>I remember reading it.</v>

4383
02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:03.390
<v Speaker 2>They really haven't mapped how much radiation is in there,</v>

4384
02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:04.221
<v Speaker 2>where it's going.</v>

4385
02:03:04.221 --> 02:03:06.000
<v Speaker 2>But one of the theories that I was,</v>

4386
02:03:06.150 --> 02:03:07.160
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to this,</v>

4387
02:03:07.161 --> 02:03:11.030
<v Speaker 2>a professor talk about the currents and the tides and where it's all going.</v>

4388
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:12.230
<v Speaker 2>That somehow or another,</v>

4389
02:03:12.231 --> 02:03:13.640
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna wind up around Baja,</v>

4390
02:03:13.641 --> 02:03:15.200
<v Speaker 2>California and Mexico.</v>

4391
02:03:15.590 --> 02:03:16.040
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4392
02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:17.120
<v Speaker 2>It's being pushed out there.</v>

4393
02:03:17.150 --> 02:03:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4394
02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:20.990
<v Speaker 2>And then it's going to pull up there because that's where everything from Japan</v>

4395
02:03:20.991 --> 02:03:21.830
<v Speaker 2>eventually go.</v>

4396
02:03:21.831 --> 02:03:22.371
<v Speaker 2>See what else?</v>

4397
02:03:22.371 --> 02:03:24.260
<v Speaker 2>This one area and pulls up and you're like,</v>

4398
02:03:24.261 --> 02:03:24.741
<v Speaker 2>that spot,</v>

4399
02:03:24.741 --> 02:03:25.610
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be dead.</v>

4400
02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

4401
02:03:26.150 --> 02:03:26.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4402
02:03:26.421 --> 02:03:27.980
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's going to kill everything.</v>

4403
02:03:27.981 --> 02:03:31.610
<v Speaker 2>And that's of course a spot that a lot of people fish and a lot of people surf</v>

4404
02:03:31.611 --> 02:03:36.611
<v Speaker 2>and it's a very popular spot and it's just going to be radioactive as fuck and</v>

4405
02:03:37.461 --> 02:03:40.460
<v Speaker 2>it's going to go through the Polynesian islands before it gets there.</v>

4406
02:03:40.461 --> 02:03:42.860
<v Speaker 2>So pretty much everything is going to get raped.</v>

4407
02:03:43.050 --> 02:03:46.850
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievably incredible that they never thought that it would be able to</v>

4408
02:03:46.851 --> 02:03:47.720
<v Speaker 2>get shut off,</v>

4409
02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:50.110
<v Speaker 2>that they just built this crazy power plant,</v>

4410
02:03:50.810 --> 02:03:52.280
<v Speaker 2>the ability to cool it down.</v>

4411
02:03:52.281 --> 02:03:55.400
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm saying is like we have these fail safe methods because</v>

4412
02:03:55.401 --> 02:03:55.701
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

4413
02:03:55.701 --> 02:03:56.510
<v Speaker 2>well it can't.</v>

4414
02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4415
02:03:56.900 --> 02:03:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Go above this.</v>

4416
02:03:57.680 --> 02:03:59.570
<v Speaker 2>And then it does because we,</v>

4417
02:03:59.600 --> 02:03:59.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4418
02:03:59.961 --> 02:04:01.760
<v Speaker 2>now whether it's become fucking crazy.</v>

4419
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Well it's also we,</v>

4420
02:04:03.170 --> 02:04:03.951
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

4421
02:04:03.951 --> 02:04:04.680
<v Speaker 2>even if we,</v>

4422
02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:06.530
<v Speaker 2>whether wasn't becoming crazy,</v>

4423
02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:09.050
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of storms have existed throughout history.</v>

4424
02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:13.820
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly arrogant and silly to assume that those storms won't exist</v>

4425
02:04:13.821 --> 02:04:17.150
<v Speaker 2>during the brief window of time that you haven't figured out how to shut these</v>

4426
02:04:17.151 --> 02:04:20.360
<v Speaker 2>plants down without it and you prepare for it because the one time it happens,</v>

4427
02:04:20.361 --> 02:04:20.900
<v Speaker 2>it's worth.</v>

4428
02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:24.890
<v Speaker 2>And also we've had earthquakes forever to like,</v>

4429
02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:26.300
<v Speaker 2>oh well here's a plant,</v>

4430
02:04:26.690 --> 02:04:28.280
<v Speaker 2>but if we have an earthquake,</v>

4431
02:04:28.330 --> 02:04:28.760
<v Speaker 2>we're fine.</v>

4432
02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:30.050
<v Speaker 2>Well you're going to have an earthquake.</v>

4433
02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Well they were good up until like a seven or something crazy like that.</v>

4434
02:04:33.740 --> 02:04:35.840
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't handle that 8.9 that rocked him.</v>

4435
02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that recent that was released</v>

4436
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:38.491
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>

4437
02:04:38.491 --> 02:04:38.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4438
02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:40.200
<v Speaker 3>this closed circuit camera,</v>

4439
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:41.460
<v Speaker 3>the tsunami coming.</v>

4440
02:04:41.461 --> 02:04:42.900
<v Speaker 3>There's a car coming in.</v>

4441
02:04:42.901 --> 02:04:46.230
<v Speaker 3>The car sees a tsunami and turns around and leaves and you see the tsunami</v>

4442
02:04:46.231 --> 02:04:47.910
<v Speaker 3>literally chasing the car down the street.</v>

4443
02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:49.490
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucked.</v>

4444
02:04:49.650 --> 02:04:53.730
<v Speaker 3>Cause when you talk about like the water got to this guy's wheels before he</v>

4445
02:04:53.731 --> 02:04:54.630
<v Speaker 3>peeled out of there.</v>

4446
02:04:54.631 --> 02:04:59.490
<v Speaker 3>And then you see the waves with caring van houses behind him carrying houses.</v>

4447
02:04:59.670 --> 02:05:01.950
<v Speaker 3>And this guy's P and who knows if he made it.</v>

4448
02:05:02.070 --> 02:05:05.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean it would have been a cruel trick if were all applauding his escape.</v>

4449
02:05:05.371 --> 02:05:07.200
<v Speaker 3>And then he runs into a fucking traffic jam,</v>

4450
02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:09.510
<v Speaker 3>a block away and gets run over with a house.</v>

4451
02:05:09.810 --> 02:05:10.261
<v Speaker 3>But when you,</v>

4452
02:05:10.261 --> 02:05:10.951
<v Speaker 3>when you watch it,</v>

4453
02:05:10.951 --> 02:05:11.820
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty dark.</v>

4454
02:05:12.330 --> 02:05:12.691
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4455
02:05:12.691 --> 02:05:13.261
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

4456
02:05:13.261 --> 02:05:13.591
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

4457
02:05:13.591 --> 02:05:16.830
<v Speaker 3>that shit came in quick caring houses.</v>

4458
02:05:17.570 --> 02:05:18.403
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

4459
02:05:18.450 --> 02:05:19.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4460
02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:20.280
<v Speaker 3>And that could happen here.</v>

4461
02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:22.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4462
02:05:22.270 --> 02:05:23.103
<v Speaker 3>it's a fault.</v>

4463
02:05:23.310 --> 02:05:23.551
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4464
02:05:23.551 --> 02:05:25.020
<v Speaker 3>it's not just a fault.</v>

4465
02:05:25.170 --> 02:05:26.480
<v Speaker 3>There's assholes that have,</v>

4466
02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:27.060
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>

4467
02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:27.893
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

4468
02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:29.130
<v Speaker 3>this isn't the video,</v>

4469
02:05:29.131 --> 02:05:33.030
<v Speaker 3>but this is one video of how quick it overcomes everything.</v>

4470
02:05:33.090 --> 02:05:33.923
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

4471
02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:35.580
<v Speaker 3>A dry city.</v>

4472
02:05:35.581 --> 02:05:37.890
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden out of nowhere,</v>

4473
02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:39.810
<v Speaker 3>here comes,</v>

4474
02:05:39.811 --> 02:05:40.411
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>

4475
02:05:40.411 --> 02:05:41.610
<v Speaker 3>You better turn around bitches.</v>

4476
02:05:41.611 --> 02:05:42.444
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

4477
02:05:42.690 --> 02:05:43.800
<v Speaker 3>Whew.</v>

4478
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:45.303
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

4479
02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:46.373
<v Speaker 7>look at this job.</v>

4480
02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:48.893
<v Speaker 7>This guy,</v>

4481
02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:52.580
<v Speaker 7>oh my God,</v>

4482
02:05:52.610 --> 02:05:52.910
<v Speaker 7>look at,</v>

4483
02:05:52.910 --> 02:05:54.590
<v Speaker 7>but it's coming in with houses.</v>

4484
02:05:54.650 --> 02:05:55.240
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4485
02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:59.050
<v Speaker 3>Not One house houses like hundreds of houses in Wood.</v>

4486
02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:02.380
<v Speaker 3>It's just fucking insane.</v>

4487
02:06:03.700 --> 02:06:04.200
<v Speaker 16>Okay.</v>

4488
02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:06.060
<v Speaker 3>And it's happened here.</v>

4489
02:06:06.090 --> 02:06:07.440
<v Speaker 3>It's happened here throughout history.</v>

4490
02:06:07.441 --> 02:06:09.450
<v Speaker 3>There was a big one apparently somewhere,</v>

4491
02:06:09.810 --> 02:06:12.330
<v Speaker 3>I think they said it was the 17 hundreds,</v>

4492
02:06:12.610 --> 02:06:12.841
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4493
02:06:12.841 --> 02:06:15.300
<v Speaker 3>in Portland somewhere allow around Portland.</v>

4494
02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:16.290
<v Speaker 3>They just wiped out.</v>

4495
02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:20.420
<v Speaker 3>Most of the Pacific northwest just came in a couple of hundred miles and it</v>

4496
02:06:20.430 --> 02:06:22.780
<v Speaker 3>fucking killed everything and pulled out and every,</v>

4497
02:06:22.850 --> 02:06:23.571
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

4498
02:06:23.571 --> 02:06:24.930
<v Speaker 3>a couple hundred years later,</v>

4499
02:06:24.931 --> 02:06:26.850
<v Speaker 3>trees grow back and everything looks nice.</v>

4500
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:28.080
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

4501
02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:29.730
<v Speaker 7>it's fine if that happens.</v>

4502
02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:31.830
<v Speaker 7>If there's not a reactor there,</v>

4503
02:06:31.860 --> 02:06:32.910
<v Speaker 7>if there's a reactor there,</v>

4504
02:06:32.911 --> 02:06:36.840
<v Speaker 7>it's pulling out all that radioactive material forever.</v>

4505
02:06:38.050 --> 02:06:38.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4506
02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:39.310
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4507
02:06:39.310 --> 02:06:40.000
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4508
02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:40.721
<v Speaker 3>Well you mean,</v>

4509
02:06:40.721 --> 02:06:41.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4510
02:06:41.170 --> 02:06:41.680
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

4511
02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:44.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the scariest thing is when it's happening somewhere near reactor.</v>

4512
02:06:44.770 --> 02:06:47.050
<v Speaker 3>What really scared me is that I don't,</v>

4513
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:51.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've heard one person come up with any way that makes sense as to</v>

4514
02:06:51.491 --> 02:06:52.324
<v Speaker 3>how to contain it.</v>

4515
02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:54.340
<v Speaker 3>Not just how to contain it,</v>

4516
02:06:54.341 --> 02:06:55.330
<v Speaker 3>but how to stop it.</v>

4517
02:06:55.331 --> 02:06:58.960
<v Speaker 3>How to clean the area up is almost just not even discussed.</v>

4518
02:06:58.990 --> 02:06:59.770
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4519
02:06:59.770 --> 02:07:00.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean how the fuck do they clean that?</v>

4520
02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:01.901
<v Speaker 3>How do you put,</v>

4521
02:07:01.901 --> 02:07:03.730
<v Speaker 3>you're going to put a giant filter on the ocean.</v>

4522
02:07:03.731 --> 02:07:06.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing they can't and that's why they don't talk about it,</v>

4523
02:07:06.610 --> 02:07:08.320
<v Speaker 3>but that's no reason either.</v>

4524
02:07:08.530 --> 02:07:11.380
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to fuck up the entire west coast cause that's like the worst case</v>

4525
02:07:11.381 --> 02:07:14.890
<v Speaker 3>doomsday scenarios that I've read online that entire west coast for sure out</v>

4526
02:07:14.891 --> 02:07:18.190
<v Speaker 3>there with the radiation moving to California at that shit is,</v>

4527
02:07:18.310 --> 02:07:19.690
<v Speaker 3>that map is scary.</v>

4528
02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:23.220
<v Speaker 3>Let's what I said that map doesn't necessarily represent radiation.</v>

4529
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4530
02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4531
02:07:24.110 --> 02:07:25.660
<v Speaker 3>let me say radiation map,</v>

4532
02:07:25.661 --> 02:07:26.650
<v Speaker 3>Japan debunked.</v>

4533
02:07:26.651 --> 02:07:27.640
<v Speaker 3>I'll pull it up because,</v>

4534
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.550
<v Speaker 16>okay.</v>

4535
02:07:29.550 --> 02:07:32.480
<v Speaker 7>You kinda are good at sort of putting some up and then debunking</v>

4536
02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:32.820
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

4537
02:07:32.820 --> 02:07:33.471
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

4538
02:07:33.471 --> 02:07:34.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm mysterious,</v>

4539
02:07:34.401 --> 02:07:35.150
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

4540
02:07:35.150 --> 02:07:36.250
<v Speaker 3>I move around.</v>

4541
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:36.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4542
02:07:36.491 --> 02:07:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Debunking the NC a radiation map.</v>

4543
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:40.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4544
02:07:40.690 --> 02:07:43.960
<v Speaker 3>More Fukushima skier scaremongering debunked.</v>

4545
02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4546
02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:45.660
<v Speaker 3>Apparently</v>

4547
02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:45.871
<v Speaker 7>not.</v>

4548
02:07:45.871 --> 02:07:45.961
<v Speaker 7>What,</v>

4549
02:07:45.961 --> 02:07:48.180
<v Speaker 7>how do you know that the debunking isn't the moment?</v>

4550
02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:49.460
<v Speaker 3>Tell them to him,</v>

4551
02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:51.370
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

4554
02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:55.533

02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:57.480
<v Speaker 17>no,</v>

4557
02:07:57.480 --> 02:07:58.060
<v Speaker 17>no,</v>

4558
02:07:58.060 --> 02:07:58.320
<v Speaker 17>no,</v>

4559
02:07:58.320 --> 02:07:58.591
<v Speaker 17>no,</v>

02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:01.030
<v Speaker 17>Uh,</v>

4564
02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:01.953
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4565
02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:04.000
<v Speaker 3>Apparently it's been debunked.</v>

4566
02:08:04.660 --> 02:08:07.300
<v Speaker 3>A couple of different websites that seems to make sense.</v>

4567
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:08.650
<v Speaker 3>Snopes,</v>

4568
02:08:08.650 --> 02:08:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Snopes debunked it.</v>

4569
02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:14.650
<v Speaker 3>Image purportedly shows radioactive sewage spreading across the Pacific Ocean</v>

4570
02:08:14.651 --> 02:08:15.790
<v Speaker 3>and is false.</v>

4571
02:08:16.450 --> 02:08:17.650
<v Speaker 3>That's not what it is.</v>

4572
02:08:18.850 --> 02:08:22.690
<v Speaker 3>But how do you know that the person is saying that isn't true?</v>

4573
02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:23.711
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

4574
02:08:23.711 --> 02:08:25.570
<v Speaker 3>If you want to be all crazy doom and gloom,</v>

4575
02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:26.350
<v Speaker 3>but me,</v>

4580
02:08:33.810 --> 02:08:34.740
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be okay.</v>

4581
02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:36.600

4587
02:08:48.881 --> 02:08:50.440
<v Speaker 3>You would look on the bright side of things.</v>

4588
02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:52.030
<v Speaker 3>The glass is half full.</v>

4589
02:08:52.031 --> 02:08:55.810
<v Speaker 3>Shane Smith of vice.com captain doom and gloom.</v>

4590
02:08:56.340 --> 02:08:58.690
<v Speaker 3>So you pay your mortgage on doom and gloom.</v>

4591
02:08:58.780 --> 02:08:59.770

4594
02:09:03.670 --> 02:09:04.570

4595
02:09:04.571 --> 02:09:05.800
<v Speaker 3>you're going to move to Montreal?</v>

4601
02:09:15.391 --> 02:09:16.650
<v Speaker 7>Can't get to me moving fast.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Is that well you don't have to worry about</v>

4603
02:09:18.870 --> 02:09:19.201
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

4604
02:09:19.201 --> 02:09:20.730
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying the shit hits the fan.</v>

4605
02:09:20.731 --> 02:09:25.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying when you have to like build a house out of logs and go trapping from</v>

4606
02:09:25.050 --> 02:09:27.350
<v Speaker 7>beavers for dinner and it's Canadian shoe man.</v>

4607
02:09:27.780 --> 02:09:30.100
<v Speaker 7>It's a good spot up there plus of global warming.</v>

4608
02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:33.660
<v Speaker 7>We get to those going to be like the road for like a thousand miles just with</v>

4609
02:09:33.661 --> 02:09:34.860
<v Speaker 7>your shopping cart dog.</v>

4610
02:09:34.861 --> 02:09:35.694
<v Speaker 7>Shit and shit.</v>

4612
02:09:37.130 --> 02:09:37.420
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4613
02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:38.490
<v Speaker 7>You need a dog sled</v>

4614
02:09:40.530 --> 02:09:41.363
<v Speaker 7>dogs.</v>

4615
02:09:41.550 --> 02:09:41.761
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

4616
02:09:41.761 --> 02:09:45.060
<v Speaker 7>that's why I'm enjoying the shit out of my shit because God knows how much</v>

4617
02:09:45.061 --> 02:09:45.691
<v Speaker 7>longer we got.</v>

4618
02:09:45.691 --> 02:09:46.524
<v Speaker 7>So enjoy it.</v>

4619
02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:49.250
<v Speaker 3>You have an extra potent doom and gloom,</v>

4620
02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:49.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4621
02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:51.410
<v Speaker 3>ideology in your head or,</v>

4622
02:09:51.411 --> 02:09:54.490
<v Speaker 3>or vision in your head rather because you're doing so much traveling.</v>

4623
02:09:54.510 --> 02:09:55.700
<v Speaker 3>So many fucked up spots.</v>

4624
02:09:55.970 --> 02:09:58.460
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were just traveling to the United States and Canada,</v>

4625
02:09:58.710 --> 02:10:01.190
<v Speaker 3>you might be like a lot of folks that are out there that are just like,</v>

4626
02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:01.550
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4627
02:10:01.550 --> 02:10:02.390
<v Speaker 3>everything's gonna be fine.</v>

4628
02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:03.893
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4629
02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:06.830
<v Speaker 7>We were talking earlier about the,</v>

4630
02:10:07.150 --> 02:10:09.730
<v Speaker 7>the 34,000 foot sort of uh,</v>

4631
02:10:10.110 --> 02:10:10.770
<v Speaker 7>how uh,</v>

4632
02:10:10.770 --> 02:10:11.880
<v Speaker 7>how it changes your shit.</v>

4633
02:10:11.940 --> 02:10:13.620
<v Speaker 7>Like you can become more emotional or whatever.</v>

4634
02:10:14.130 --> 02:10:15.970
<v Speaker 7>It was interesting will explain that for the people didn't,</v>

4635
02:10:15.990 --> 02:10:18.630
<v Speaker 7>weren't listening at like high altitude,</v>

4636
02:10:18.631 --> 02:10:19.440
<v Speaker 7>long haul.</v>

4637
02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:20.840
<v Speaker 7>You get this lights.</v>

4638
02:10:20.850 --> 02:10:21.180
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4639
02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:22.710
<v Speaker 7>Like 34,000 pieces of cruising,</v>

4640
02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:24.960
<v Speaker 7>flight of general commercial aviation.</v>

4641
02:10:25.530 --> 02:10:30.240
<v Speaker 7>And so there's a syndrome where you feel emotions much stronger.</v>

4642
02:10:30.241 --> 02:10:32.700
<v Speaker 7>So if you're like watching a movie for example,</v>

4643
02:10:32.701 --> 02:10:34.030
<v Speaker 7>and I was to that on</v>

4644
02:10:34.170 --> 02:10:35.540
<v Speaker 5>the movie Armageddon,</v>

4645
02:10:35.541 --> 02:10:37.020
<v Speaker 5>I was like bawling my eyes out.</v>

4646
02:10:37.670 --> 02:10:38.061
<v Speaker 5>You just,</v>

4647
02:10:38.061 --> 02:10:39.680
<v Speaker 5>you have this uncontrollable like,</v>

4648
02:10:39.681 --> 02:10:40.191
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

4649
02:10:40.191 --> 02:10:41.690
<v Speaker 5>he's going to marry Liv Tyler or whatever.</v>

4650
02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:42.921
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4651
02:10:42.921 --> 02:10:43.101
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

4652
02:10:43.101 --> 02:10:43.580
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

4653
02:10:43.580 --> 02:10:44.480
<v Speaker 5>normally it wouldn't be like,</v>

4654
02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:47.780
<v Speaker 5>but you can also feel a euphoric.</v>

4655
02:10:47.781 --> 02:10:48.620
<v Speaker 5>You can feel sad,</v>

4656
02:10:48.621 --> 02:10:49.041
<v Speaker 5>you can like,</v>

4657
02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:51.560
<v Speaker 5>it's just a sort of emotion crank,</v>

4658
02:10:51.590 --> 02:10:51.861
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4659
02:10:51.861 --> 02:10:52.041
<v Speaker 5>at,</v>

4660
02:10:52.041 --> 02:10:52.281
<v Speaker 5>at,</v>

4661
02:10:52.281 --> 02:10:53.390
<v Speaker 5>at high altitudes.</v>

4662
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:54.763
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4663
02:10:56.090 --> 02:10:56.923
<v Speaker 5>what were we talking about?</v>

4664
02:10:57.700 --> 02:10:57.890
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4665
02:10:57.890 --> 02:10:59.120
<v Speaker 5>you were talking about emotions,</v>

4666
02:11:00.190 --> 02:11:00.650
<v Speaker 5>emotions,</v>

4667
02:11:00.650 --> 02:11:00.970
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>

4668
02:11:00.970 --> 02:11:01.291
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

4669
02:11:01.291 --> 02:11:01.361
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4670
02:11:01.361 --> 02:11:01.610
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

4671
02:11:01.610 --> 02:11:02.000
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4672
02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.710
<v Speaker 5>So when I come back on playing,</v>

4673
02:11:03.711 --> 02:11:05.930
<v Speaker 5>sometimes I have these emotional things and I'm like,</v>

4674
02:11:05.931 --> 02:11:06.764
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

4675
02:11:06.890 --> 02:11:07.723
<v Speaker 5>Fuck it.</v>

4676
02:11:07.790 --> 02:11:09.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to get a place in the Canadian shield.</v>

4677
02:11:09.771 --> 02:11:10.491
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to get a place,</v>

4678
02:11:10.491 --> 02:11:11.510
<v Speaker 5>just hedge my bets.</v>

4679
02:11:11.690 --> 02:11:13.130
<v Speaker 5>Just maybe shit doesn't go wrong,</v>

4680
02:11:13.131 --> 02:11:14.000
<v Speaker 5>but I always say this,</v>

4681
02:11:14.001 --> 02:11:16.310
<v Speaker 5>if you notice there's a 1% chance or a 5% chance,</v>

4682
02:11:16.490 --> 02:11:17.390
<v Speaker 5>you didn't hedge your bets,</v>

4683
02:11:17.391 --> 02:11:18.224
<v Speaker 5>you're a fucking idiot.</v>

4684
02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:18.861
<v Speaker 5>So I'm like,</v>

4685
02:11:18.861 --> 02:11:19.161
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4686
02:11:19.161 --> 02:11:20.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to hedge my bet.</v>

4687
02:11:20.031 --> 02:11:24.110
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to get a place up in the Canadian shield with a freshwater lake and no</v>

4688
02:11:24.111 --> 02:11:24.801
<v Speaker 5>one can get to.</v>

4689
02:11:24.801 --> 02:11:27.380
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to get to all this shit and now you're going to build a fucking</v>

4690
02:11:27.381 --> 02:11:28.330
<v Speaker 5>cottage on there.</v>

4691
02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:30.470
<v Speaker 5>You can have a cottage during the summers.</v>

4692
02:11:30.471 --> 02:11:31.071
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

4693
02:11:31.071 --> 02:11:32.000
<v Speaker 5>if a shit goes bad,</v>

4694
02:11:32.001 --> 02:11:32.451
<v Speaker 5>you're up there,</v>

4695
02:11:32.451 --> 02:11:32.951
<v Speaker 5>you got water,</v>

4696
02:11:32.951 --> 02:11:33.490
<v Speaker 5>you got all shit.</v>

4697
02:11:33.490 --> 02:11:33.771
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

4698
02:11:33.771 --> 02:11:34.580
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>

4699
02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:39.580
<v Speaker 5>Now I thought this was a particular sort of lunacy of my 34,000 foot fly back</v>

4700
02:11:39.741 --> 02:11:41.780
<v Speaker 5>from carpooled to fucking cheeseburger land.</v>

4701
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:44.450
<v Speaker 5>And then I started talking to people,</v>

4702
02:11:44.630 --> 02:11:44.990
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

4703
02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:49.990
<v Speaker 5>who are like running media companies or journalists or run the bureau out of</v>

4704
02:11:50.841 --> 02:11:51.111
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4705
02:11:51.111 --> 02:11:51.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4706
02:11:51.690 --> 02:11:52.300
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4707
02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:53.390
<v Speaker 5>Qubole or you know,</v>

4708
02:11:53.391 --> 02:11:53.930
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

4709
02:11:53.930 --> 02:11:54.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4710
02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:58.100
<v Speaker 5>people who have been sort of around the world are doing every single fucking one</v>

4711
02:11:58.101 --> 02:11:58.730
<v Speaker 5>of them is like,</v>

4712
02:11:58.730 --> 02:11:59.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to bolt hole.</v>

4713
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.171
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4714
02:12:00.171 --> 02:12:01.760
<v Speaker 5>I got a place in the mountains here.</v>

4715
02:12:02.030 --> 02:12:03.410
<v Speaker 5>I got a place over here.</v>

4716
02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:04.940
<v Speaker 5>I got a place over there.</v>

4717
02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:09.080
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's because you realize it probably won't happen,</v>

4718
02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:09.950
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

4719
02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:11.330
<v Speaker 5>and it shouldn't happen.</v>

4720
02:12:11.630 --> 02:12:15.940
<v Speaker 5>And people thought at the end of the world was coming for a long time and,</v>

4721
02:12:15.941 --> 02:12:17.540
<v Speaker 5>and I'm the least sort of,</v>

4722
02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:17.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4723
02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:18.890
<v Speaker 5>conspiracy theory,</v>

4724
02:12:18.891 --> 02:12:19.051
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4725
02:12:19.051 --> 02:12:20.960
<v Speaker 5>we're all going to die kind of guy and all this shit.</v>

4726
02:12:20.961 --> 02:12:21.370
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

4727
02:12:21.370 --> 02:12:26.370
<v Speaker 5>if it hasn't happened before now and then however you go to enough things like</v>

4728
02:12:27.171 --> 02:12:31.220
<v Speaker 5>Fukushima or like Greenland or like Dagestan or Pakistan or all these,</v>

4729
02:12:31.221 --> 02:12:32.180
<v Speaker 5>Pakistan by the way,</v>

4730
02:12:32.181 --> 02:12:33.860
<v Speaker 5>is becoming a failed state.</v>

4731
02:12:33.890 --> 02:12:38.890
<v Speaker 5>It has fucking over a hundred warheads on ms child's ready to fucking go.</v>

4732
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:42.080
<v Speaker 5>So at a certain point you're just like,</v>

4733
02:12:42.380 --> 02:12:43.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm a gambling man.</v>

4734
02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:45.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to hedge my bets.</v>

4735
02:12:45.650 --> 02:12:50.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to fucking just have a bolt hole because if shit goes down,</v>

4736
02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:51.590
<v Speaker 5>why the fuck wouldn't you?</v>

4737
02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:52.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4738
02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:52.310
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4739
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:56.330
<v Speaker 5>and I didn't think it affected me until I had that discussion.</v>

4740
02:12:56.331 --> 02:12:57.890
<v Speaker 5>It was one of those things where it's like,</v>

4741
02:12:58.280 --> 02:12:59.120
<v Speaker 5>I masturbate.</v>

4742
02:12:59.121 --> 02:12:59.321
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4743
02:12:59.321 --> 02:12:59.811
<v Speaker 5>So do I.</v>

4744
02:12:59.811 --> 02:13:00.291
<v Speaker 5>So do I,</v>

4745
02:13:00.291 --> 02:13:00.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4746
02:13:00.770 --> 02:13:03.700
<v Speaker 5>it's like everybody admitted to we,</v>

4747
02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:06.110
<v Speaker 5>we have this sort of paranoia and they were all,</v>

4748
02:13:06.111 --> 02:13:07.390
<v Speaker 5>it was kind of like mine to do.</v>

4749
02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:07.881
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

4750
02:13:07.881 --> 02:13:08.331
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck,</v>

4751
02:13:08.331 --> 02:13:09.290
<v Speaker 5>it's fucked me up now.</v>

4752
02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:11.150
<v Speaker 5>And then I felt like I have a fucked up,</v>

4753
02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:11.420
<v Speaker 5>huh?</v>

4754
02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:11.631
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4755
02:13:11.631 --> 02:13:16.631
<v Speaker 6>When you travel it's hard to deny or turn an eye to the things that you see</v>

4756
02:13:18.291 --> 02:13:20.810
<v Speaker 6>going on in the conditions that are in other places.</v>

4757
02:13:20.811 --> 02:13:24.260
<v Speaker 6>And like we are fed the illest Soma here in America.</v>

4758
02:13:24.261 --> 02:13:27.410
<v Speaker 6>We get the best Soma and I think it really,</v>

4759
02:13:27.411 --> 02:13:30.170
<v Speaker 6>really blinds us to what's going on and what could happen to us.</v>

4760
02:13:30.650 --> 02:13:31.480
<v Speaker 10>When you say Sama,</v>

4761
02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:32.940
<v Speaker 10>you don't mean the sleeping pills,</v>

4762
02:13:34.050 --> 02:13:34.861
<v Speaker 10>the brave new world.</v>

4763
02:13:34.861 --> 02:13:35.581
<v Speaker 10>Aldous Huxley,</v>

4764
02:13:35.581 --> 02:13:36.170
<v Speaker 10>like right.</v>

4765
02:13:36.170 --> 02:13:36.750
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

4766
02:13:36.750 --> 02:13:37.800
<v Speaker 10>the wool over our eyes.</v>

4767
02:13:37.801 --> 02:13:38.790
<v Speaker 10>Like we have television,</v>

4768
02:13:38.791 --> 02:13:39.630
<v Speaker 10>we have memes,</v>

4769
02:13:39.631 --> 02:13:40.464
<v Speaker 10>we have,</v>

4770
02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:41.100
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

4771
02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:42.480
<v Speaker 10>all these things that distract us.</v>

4772
02:13:42.481 --> 02:13:43.680
<v Speaker 10>We have cheap food,</v>

4773
02:13:44.010 --> 02:13:45.450
<v Speaker 10>we have cheap real estate,</v>

4774
02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:46.740
<v Speaker 10>we have cheap loans,</v>

4775
02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:47.281
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

4776
02:13:47.281 --> 02:13:47.491
<v Speaker 10>and,</v>

4777
02:13:47.491 --> 02:13:52.020
<v Speaker 10>and so I think it distracts us from the fact that like these problems that are</v>

4778
02:13:52.021 --> 02:13:55.170
<v Speaker 10>at the water's edge could be at your door very quickly.</v>

4779
02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:58.350
<v Speaker 10>And you see it like Detroit I think is the latest example.</v>

4780
02:13:58.770 --> 02:13:59.603
<v Speaker 10>Hmm.</v>

4781
02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:01.300
<v Speaker 5>Detroit as a scary example,</v>

4782
02:14:01.301 --> 02:14:05.860
<v Speaker 5>we were there filming and there were houses for sell for $500 you buy a house</v>

4783
02:14:05.861 --> 02:14:06.641
<v Speaker 5>for 500 bucks.</v>

4784
02:14:06.641 --> 02:14:08.170
<v Speaker 5>We did a story there that I fucking,</v>

4785
02:14:08.171 --> 02:14:09.004
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry I didn't,</v>

4786
02:14:09.010 --> 02:14:09.161
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4787
02:14:09.161 --> 02:14:09.651
<v Speaker 5>I was going to say,</v>

4788
02:14:09.651 --> 02:14:11.860
<v Speaker 5>and the smell in the air is insane.</v>

4789
02:14:11.890 --> 02:14:14.050
<v Speaker 5>The pollution is so tangible and you feel,</v>

4790
02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:16.780
<v Speaker 5>we have this great story of these uh,</v>

4791
02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:17.633
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4792
02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:18.640
<v Speaker 5>kids,</v>

4793
02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:18.911
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4794
02:14:18.911 --> 02:14:22.570
<v Speaker 5>and they're scrappers and they go into these houses that are abandoned houses</v>

4795
02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:24.910
<v Speaker 5>and they rip every piece of metal out of it,</v>

4796
02:14:24.911 --> 02:14:25.570
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4797
02:14:25.570 --> 02:14:27.040
<v Speaker 5>And then they sell it to these,</v>

4798
02:14:27.041 --> 02:14:27.641
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4799
02:14:27.641 --> 02:14:28.474
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4800
02:14:28.510 --> 02:14:29.343
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4801
02:14:29.470 --> 02:14:32.940
<v Speaker 5>barges and the barges come in and they fill them with all this crap.</v>

4802
02:14:32.941 --> 02:14:34.120
<v Speaker 5>And all the schools,</v>

4803
02:14:34.121 --> 02:14:35.140
<v Speaker 5>all the old hospitals,</v>

4804
02:14:35.380 --> 02:14:36.790
<v Speaker 5>they're just ripping all the metal out,</v>

4805
02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:37.780
<v Speaker 5>all the girders,</v>

4806
02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:38.770
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

4807
02:14:38.770 --> 02:14:43.770
<v Speaker 5>And they ship it to China because the quest for steel is insatiable.</v>

4808
02:14:44.590 --> 02:14:44.951
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

4809
02:14:44.951 --> 02:14:46.810
<v Speaker 5>and we founded in Baltimore,</v>

4810
02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:47.890
<v Speaker 5>we did it in Cleveland,</v>

4811
02:14:47.891 --> 02:14:52.000
<v Speaker 5>we did in Detroit where we're ripping the shit out of our old industrial cities</v>

4812
02:14:52.001 --> 02:14:55.930
<v Speaker 5>and literally melting it down to do the new industrial cities in China.</v>

4813
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:57.550
<v Speaker 5>It's so organic.</v>

4814
02:14:57.610 --> 02:14:58.150
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

4815
02:14:58.150 --> 02:14:58.930
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4816
02:14:58.930 --> 02:14:59.411
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4817
02:14:59.411 --> 02:15:02.890
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of a poetic story actually were pulling down our shit,</v>

4818
02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:05.460
<v Speaker 5>melting it and then building it for the,</v>

4819
02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:07.450
<v Speaker 5>for what they did with the,</v>

4820
02:15:08.350 --> 02:15:09.183
<v Speaker 5>all the record.</v>

4821
02:15:09.740 --> 02:15:11.750
<v Speaker 5>David Shosha shot that for really?</v>

4822
02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:16.540
<v Speaker 5>David Cho is the host of that and he goes out with the kids as they,</v>

4823
02:15:16.570 --> 02:15:17.030
<v Speaker 5>as they,</v>

4824
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.291
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

4825
02:15:17.291 --> 02:15:21.840
<v Speaker 5>they rip these buildings every fucking like big industrial schools and she had</v>

4826
02:15:21.850 --> 02:15:25.180
<v Speaker 5>factories and they just take all the fucking didn't,</v>

4827
02:15:25.470 --> 02:15:25.800
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

4828
02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:26.650
<v Speaker 5>that's so crazy.</v>

4829
02:15:26.651 --> 02:15:28.400
<v Speaker 5>Who didn't that isn't that what they did with the,</v>

4830
02:15:28.401 --> 02:15:30.220
<v Speaker 5>with the twin towers when they fell as well?</v>

4831
02:15:30.221 --> 02:15:31.570
<v Speaker 5>Didn't they sell the scrap to China?</v>

4832
02:15:31.630 --> 02:15:31.721
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4833
02:15:31.721 --> 02:15:32.231
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

4834
02:15:32.231 --> 02:15:32.741
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>

4835
02:15:32.741 --> 02:15:33.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure they did.</v>

4836
02:15:33.700 --> 02:15:37.360
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure they a box it all up and ship that North Korea,</v>

4837
02:15:37.361 --> 02:15:38.500
<v Speaker 5>when you go around North Korea,</v>

4838
02:15:38.501 --> 02:15:40.600
<v Speaker 5>all the buildings have like all these big,</v>

4839
02:15:40.710 --> 02:15:41.580
<v Speaker 5>like they looked like they,</v>

4840
02:15:42.090 --> 02:15:42.923
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4841
02:15:43.060 --> 02:15:47.500
<v Speaker 5>concrete woodpecker has packed away at them cause they pull out the rebar and</v>

4842
02:15:47.501 --> 02:15:50.140
<v Speaker 5>then they sell the rebar to China's scrap and you're like,</v>

4843
02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:50.770
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

4844
02:15:50.770 --> 02:15:51.101
<v Speaker 5>hold on.</v>

4845
02:15:51.101 --> 02:15:52.780
<v Speaker 5>You're going to make your whole fucking,</v>

4846
02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:53.350
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4847
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:55.660
<v Speaker 5>how much money can you get for that much rebar?</v>

4848
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:58.150
<v Speaker 5>Like 500 bucks,</v>

4849
02:15:59.310 --> 02:16:00.420
<v Speaker 10>get the contact.</v>

4850
02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:00.961
<v Speaker 10>Do you know what I mean?</v>

4851
02:16:00.961 --> 02:16:02.100
<v Speaker 10>Like if you're stealing,</v>

4852
02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:03.450
<v Speaker 10>if you're a scrapper and Detroit,</v>

4853
02:16:03.451 --> 02:16:06.570
<v Speaker 10>how did you get in touch with people that melt this down and then sell it to</v>

4854
02:16:06.571 --> 02:16:07.370
<v Speaker 10>China?</v>

4855
02:16:07.370 --> 02:16:07.461
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4856
02:16:07.461 --> 02:16:07.640
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4857
02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:10.850
<v Speaker 5>because China's buying essentially all the scrap.</v>

4858
02:16:10.851 --> 02:16:14.060
<v Speaker 5>They have such a desire for steel and steel is expensive and hard to me.</v>

4859
02:16:14.300 --> 02:16:17.750
<v Speaker 5>So to get scrapped and then melted down is actually more cost efficient.</v>

4860
02:16:17.751 --> 02:16:19.310
<v Speaker 5>Even shipping it across the world.</v>

4861
02:16:19.790 --> 02:16:22.220
<v Speaker 5>So what they're doing is not just in America,</v>

4862
02:16:22.221 --> 02:16:23.990
<v Speaker 5>there are anywhere where they can send scrap.</v>

4863
02:16:24.020 --> 02:16:26.000
<v Speaker 5>The open order is send it here.</v>

4864
02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:28.340
<v Speaker 5>It's not just get Detroit's,</v>

4865
02:16:28.650 --> 02:16:29.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4866
02:16:29.050 --> 02:16:30.100
<v Speaker 5>schools and give them,</v>

4867
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:30.671
<v Speaker 2>to me it's,</v>

4868
02:16:30.671 --> 02:16:31.420
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4869
02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:31.990
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4870
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:32.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4871
02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:34.630
<v Speaker 2>they're just taking all the scrap from everywhere.</v>

4872
02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4873
02:16:35.170 --> 02:16:37.540
<v Speaker 2>there's a demand and then it filters down Zachary Hood.</v>

4874
02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4875
02:16:39.430 --> 02:16:39.881
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

4876
02:16:39.881 --> 02:16:43.490
<v Speaker 2>So it's such a weird and ironic twist to our store,</v>

4877
02:16:43.491 --> 02:16:43.990
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

4878
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:45.520
<v Speaker 2>What a poetic fucking,</v>

4879
02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:50.580
<v Speaker 2>we sold off our manufacturing overseas to the WTO and all the different bills</v>

4880
02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:56.640
<v Speaker 2>they pass that cut out the manufacturing base in this country,</v>

4881
02:16:56.830 --> 02:17:00.090
<v Speaker 2>and then they slowly extract the metal and ship it into the over to.</v>

4882
02:17:00.310 --> 02:17:03.970
<v Speaker 2>We're living off the sort of remnants of that society and we're like taking</v>

4883
02:17:03.971 --> 02:17:05.790
<v Speaker 2>everything and going salad salad.</v>

4884
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.880
<v Speaker 2>So weird.</v>

4885
02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:07.391
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4886
02:17:07.391 --> 02:17:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Detroit has started to make a comeback as far as cars at least.</v>

4887
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4888
02:17:11.410 --> 02:17:12.610
<v Speaker 2>At least American cars,</v>

4889
02:17:12.611 --> 02:17:14.350
<v Speaker 2>they started producing real cars again,</v>

4890
02:17:14.351 --> 02:17:15.580
<v Speaker 2>like Cadillac one,</v>

4891
02:17:15.581 --> 02:17:17.640
<v Speaker 2>the car the year motor trend car of the year.</v>

4892
02:17:17.950 --> 02:17:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4893
02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:20.880
<v Speaker 2>the CTS V it's a fucking bad ass car.</v>

4894
02:17:20.980 --> 02:17:22.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a technological marvel.</v>

4895
02:17:22.541 --> 02:17:25.390
<v Speaker 2>It handles as good as any German car that's ever been made.</v>

4896
02:17:25.391 --> 02:17:27.200
<v Speaker 2>The build quality spectacular they have.</v>

4897
02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:28.600
<v Speaker 2>They're actually making real cars.</v>

4898
02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:31.300
<v Speaker 2>The new corvette or the new Corvettes.</v>

4899
02:17:31.301 --> 02:17:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

4900
02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:33.070
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing car.</v>

4901
02:17:33.071 --> 02:17:35.470
<v Speaker 2>They're making cars that people want to buy,</v>

4902
02:17:35.740 --> 02:17:36.573
<v Speaker 2>like finally,</v>

4903
02:17:36.730 --> 02:17:37.481
<v Speaker 2>but God damn,</v>

4904
02:17:37.481 --> 02:17:39.280
<v Speaker 2>they fucked it up for a long time.</v>

4905
02:17:39.970 --> 02:17:43.300
<v Speaker 2>You remember from the 70s until like today,</v>

4906
02:17:43.570 --> 02:17:44.890
<v Speaker 2>American cars were a joke.</v>

4907
02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:46.600
<v Speaker 2>If you weren't buying a Ford pickup truck,</v>

4908
02:17:46.810 --> 02:17:49.630
<v Speaker 2>those really solid as a rock Chevy pickup trucks,</v>

4909
02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:50.980
<v Speaker 2>like things along those lines.</v>

4910
02:17:51.130 --> 02:17:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Most of American cars were dog shit.</v>

4911
02:17:54.070 --> 02:17:54.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4912
02:17:54.251 --> 02:17:56.770
<v Speaker 2>What was quality control talk shit.</v>

4913
02:17:56.771 --> 02:17:57.730
<v Speaker 2>You have to give a shit.</v>

4914
02:17:58.230 --> 02:18:02.900
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is is Japanese people I ended up started lunch really were like</v>

4915
02:18:02.910 --> 02:18:03.610
<v Speaker 2>give a shit.</v>

4916
02:18:03.610 --> 02:18:03.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4917
02:18:03.911 --> 02:18:04.481
<v Speaker 2>Their culture,</v>

4918
02:18:04.481 --> 02:18:04.681
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

4919
02:18:04.681 --> 02:18:07.420
<v Speaker 2>they're missing all the fucking crucial elements that make,</v>

4920
02:18:07.421 --> 02:18:09.670
<v Speaker 2>every American thinks that he's awesome individually,</v>

4921
02:18:10.500 --> 02:18:13.030
<v Speaker 2>so much so that they're not willing to succeed to the group.</v>

4922
02:18:13.330 --> 02:18:13.961
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4923
02:18:13.961 --> 02:18:14.561
<v Speaker 2>in Japan,</v>

4924
02:18:14.561 --> 02:18:17.290
<v Speaker 2>like it's a big part of working at a factory is that everything is for the</v>

4925
02:18:17.291 --> 02:18:17.740
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>

4926
02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Everything for company and they,</v>

4927
02:18:19.631 --> 02:18:20.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4928
02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:23.410
<v Speaker 2>they take pride in the fact that the company does well also,</v>

4929
02:18:23.411 --> 02:18:24.430
<v Speaker 2>if you go to any like,</v>

4930
02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:25.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4931
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:28.510
<v Speaker 2>shitty five o'clock fucking drunk ramen place,</v>

4932
02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:31.540
<v Speaker 2>they'd been boiling that stock for two days and everything's perfect.</v>

4933
02:18:31.780 --> 02:18:33.640
<v Speaker 2>You go to a Shitty Yakitori place.</v>

4934
02:18:33.790 --> 02:18:37.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like they've met the make it the best they possibly fucking can.</v>

4935
02:18:37.450 --> 02:18:38.680
<v Speaker 2>And it's like they give a shit.</v>

4936
02:18:39.230 --> 02:18:40.990
<v Speaker 2>If I'm going to make fucking Yakitori,</v>

4937
02:18:40.991 --> 02:18:41.651
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be the best.</v>

4938
02:18:41.651 --> 02:18:43.180
<v Speaker 2>God Damn Yakitori I can possibly,</v>

4939
02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:43.571
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4940
02:18:43.571 --> 02:18:46.960
<v Speaker 2>we got this entitled attitude in this country or I shouldn't say we.</v>

4941
02:18:46.961 --> 02:18:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Some people have this,</v>

4942
02:18:48.341 --> 02:18:50.140
<v Speaker 2>it's a poison of character.</v>

4943
02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

4944
02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:55.120
<v Speaker 2>And it's a great fucking Yakitori fuck it.</v>

4945
02:18:55.121 --> 02:18:55.871
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make it shit.</v>

4946
02:18:55.871 --> 02:18:56.291
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

4947
02:18:56.291 --> 02:18:58.330
<v Speaker 2>well hold on if you're going to fucking do it.</v>

4948
02:18:58.750 --> 02:19:00.870
<v Speaker 2>But he has anything to do anything.</v>

4949
02:19:01.090 --> 02:19:01.281
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4950
02:19:01.281 --> 02:19:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Shane pointed out the Ramen Yakitori it makes sense because there's a lot of</v>

4951
02:19:05.111 --> 02:19:08.140
<v Speaker 2>chefs that get a lot of a claim in this country simply for the fact that they</v>

4952
02:19:08.141 --> 02:19:11.350
<v Speaker 2>speak English because they can communicate it better.</v>

4953
02:19:11.500 --> 02:19:15.400
<v Speaker 2>They have the money to open a Yaki Tory place in the right neighborhood where</v>

4954
02:19:15.401 --> 02:19:17.170
<v Speaker 2>writers live where it's accessible,</v>

4955
02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:18.580
<v Speaker 2>but they usually,</v>

4956
02:19:19.060 --> 02:19:20.860
<v Speaker 2>it's not about authentic or whatever.</v>

4957
02:19:20.861 --> 02:19:25.450
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly what you talked about is the person from that culture probably</v>

4958
02:19:25.451 --> 02:19:27.710
<v Speaker 2>gives a shit more because it them</v>

4959
02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:31.700
<v Speaker 10>in a lot of people like young chefs and things like that,</v>

4960
02:19:31.701 --> 02:19:36.020
<v Speaker 10>they think that they can go over to someplace for a couple of weeks and be like,</v>

4961
02:19:36.050 --> 02:19:36.171
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>

4962
02:19:36.171 --> 02:19:38.150
<v Speaker 10>I can make yagats where I can make ramen this.</v>

4963
02:19:38.390 --> 02:19:39.380
<v Speaker 10>This is easy stuff.</v>

4964
02:19:39.381 --> 02:19:39.561
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

4965
02:19:39.561 --> 02:19:41.000
<v Speaker 10>like that Guy Ivan Ramen,</v>

4966
02:19:41.001 --> 02:19:41.571
<v Speaker 10>he's very,</v>

4967
02:19:41.571 --> 02:19:42.321
<v Speaker 10>very famous.</v>

4968
02:19:42.321 --> 02:19:43.730
<v Speaker 10>He did ramen in Japan,</v>

4969
02:19:43.731 --> 02:19:45.140
<v Speaker 10>but he lived that shit.</v>

4970
02:19:45.620 --> 02:19:45.831
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

4971
02:19:45.831 --> 02:19:47.570
<v Speaker 10>you really have to lie.</v>

4972
02:19:48.370 --> 02:19:50.030
<v Speaker 10>He named himself after the soup.</v>

<v Speaker 10>And he became,</v>

4976
02:19:53.390 --> 02:19:54.000
<v Speaker 10>because he was,</v>

4977
02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:54.741
<v Speaker 10>I'm not sure,</v>

02:19:54.741 --> 02:19:56.150
<v Speaker 10>he opened a place in New York.</v>

4983
02:19:58.811 --> 02:20:00.520

4984
02:20:01.130 --> 02:20:05.360
<v Speaker 10>then it would be interesting to find out if because of his name he became Mr</v>

4985
02:20:05.361 --> 02:20:06.141
<v Speaker 10>Ramen or if,</v>

5016
02:20:54.791 --> 02:20:56.230
<v Speaker 10>If somebody was doing that here,</v>

5017
02:20:56.440 --> 02:21:00.130
<v Speaker 10>he'd put that guy in a glass case in the front of his restaurant where a chef</v>

02:21:12.991 --> 02:21:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't even submit to those things.</v>

5031
02:21:17.450 --> 02:21:18.410
<v Speaker 2>I had met these sites,</v>

5032
02:21:18.570 --> 02:21:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Julia Child Bitch.</v>

5033
02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:21.890
<v Speaker 2>That shit is funny.</v>

5034
02:21:21.890 --> 02:21:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Was going to step up and give me the [inaudible] money to one my new fast food</v>

5035
02:21:26.341 --> 02:21:26.840
<v Speaker 2>joint.</v>

5036
02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:28.590
<v Speaker 10>Who's the best chef in the world?</v>

5037
02:21:29.930 --> 02:21:30.860
<v Speaker 10>I think that's,</v>

5038
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:32.420
<v Speaker 10>I don't think that's Dario say.</v>

5039
02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:33.430
<v Speaker 10>Go.</v>

5040
02:21:33.430 --> 02:21:33.921
<v Speaker 10>Do you ask her?</v>

5041
02:21:33.921 --> 02:21:35.390
<v Speaker 10>She'll know what question I could answer.</v>

5042
02:21:35.391 --> 02:21:37.460
<v Speaker 10>I can't answer like who's the best chef in the world?</v>

5043
02:21:37.461 --> 02:21:41.870
<v Speaker 10>I think there's no answer that I will say that there's one set I met that I</v>

5044
02:21:41.871 --> 02:21:43.970
<v Speaker 10>would bet I do bowel too in the,</v>

5045
02:21:43.971 --> 02:21:48.971
<v Speaker 10>I'm like his fucking grasshopper and when I see him he inspires me and I just</v>

5046
02:21:49.881 --> 02:21:52.250
<v Speaker 10>want to be a fly on the wall in his kitchen and hanging out with him.</v>

5047
02:21:52.251 --> 02:21:53.090
<v Speaker 10>He's the best master.</v>

5048
02:21:53.091 --> 02:21:57.050
<v Speaker 10>You incestuous and he's been featured in like Fuchsia Dunlop.</v>

5049
02:21:57.220 --> 02:21:58.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say Emeril.</v>

5050
02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:00.750
<v Speaker 2>Emeril is also the man.</v>

5051
02:22:00.780 --> 02:22:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Damn,</v>

5052
02:22:01.260 --> 02:22:02.093
<v Speaker 2>I met Emeril.</v>

5053
02:22:02.100 --> 02:22:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Emeril.</v>

5054
02:22:02.700 --> 02:22:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Emeril is a stand</v>

5055
02:22:03.660 --> 02:22:04.091
<v Speaker 10>up dude.</v>

5056
02:22:04.091 --> 02:22:04.924
<v Speaker 10>Really cool,</v>

5057
02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:06.970
<v Speaker 10>really cool down our through to really knows his food.</v>

5058
02:22:06.971 --> 02:22:09.580
<v Speaker 10>But master you in Chengdu.</v>

5059
02:22:09.581 --> 02:22:10.360
<v Speaker 10>I met,</v>

5060
02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:12.400
<v Speaker 10>cooked me some of the best meals I've ever seen.</v>

5061
02:22:12.401 --> 02:22:16.750
<v Speaker 10>And then he also kind of showed me new techniques on dishes that I'd been</v>

5062
02:22:16.751 --> 02:22:17.740
<v Speaker 10>cooking for years.</v>

5063
02:22:17.800 --> 02:22:18.150
<v Speaker 10>Right.</v>

5064
02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:18.940
<v Speaker 10>And,</v>

5065
02:22:18.940 --> 02:22:19.751
<v Speaker 10>and that's dope.</v>

5066
02:22:19.751 --> 02:22:22.720
<v Speaker 10>When somebody can take something you've been doing for so long and be like,</v>

5067
02:22:23.020 --> 02:22:24.040
<v Speaker 10>check it out this way.</v>

5068
02:22:24.370 --> 02:22:25.203
<v Speaker 10>Like what was the,</v>

5069
02:22:25.260 --> 02:22:25.831
<v Speaker 10>in the variations,</v>

5070
02:22:25.831 --> 02:22:27.300
<v Speaker 10>what were the dish that he cooked for you?</v>

5071
02:22:27.570 --> 02:22:27.901
<v Speaker 10>All right.</v>

5072
02:22:27.901 --> 02:22:32.670
<v Speaker 10>So the simplest thing was the most impressive thing that he taught me was Chili</v>

5073
02:22:32.670 --> 02:22:32.970
<v Speaker 10>Oil,</v>

5074
02:22:32.970 --> 02:22:33.570
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

5075
02:22:33.570 --> 02:22:38.230
<v Speaker 10>People will always have an issue with temperature and making Chili oil to get it</v>

5076
02:22:38.231 --> 02:22:40.500
<v Speaker 10>at the right temperature and use the thermometer and things like that.</v>

5077
02:22:41.070 --> 02:22:42.060
<v Speaker 10>Chili oil,</v>

5078
02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:47.120
<v Speaker 10>what he does is he heats up his oil to a certain point where canola oil will be</v>

5079
02:22:47.401 --> 02:22:48.330
<v Speaker 10>a little yellow at first.</v>

5080
02:22:48.330 --> 02:22:50.670
<v Speaker 10>He'll heat heated up so hot that it becomes white,</v>

5081
02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:52.800
<v Speaker 10>let the temperature drop.</v>

5082
02:22:52.980 --> 02:22:57.210
<v Speaker 10>Then he'll heat it up till it's hot to the touch and put it over the chili</v>

5083
02:22:57.211 --> 02:22:58.044
<v Speaker 10>grounds,</v>

5084
02:22:58.200 --> 02:23:03.000
<v Speaker 10>and that'll be like an encasing so that when he puts hotter oil on top,</v>

5085
02:23:03.150 --> 02:23:04.740
<v Speaker 10>it won't burn the Chili Oil.</v>

5086
02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:06.150
<v Speaker 10>So he'll cook it in a,</v>

5087
02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:09.030
<v Speaker 10>in an oil that's just slightly hot to touch.</v>

5088
02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:12.480
<v Speaker 10>Then he'll heat it up another 60 degrees or something,</v>

5089
02:23:12.690 --> 02:23:16.560
<v Speaker 10>put more of that oil and then he'll get it ripping hot and put that oil in,</v>

5090
02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:18.900
<v Speaker 10>but the Chili never burns.</v>

5091
02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:23.960
<v Speaker 10>And then you can also see how the flavor of the chilies and the smell of the</v>

5092
02:23:24.211 --> 02:23:26.940
<v Speaker 10>Chili's changes at every temperature.</v>

5093
02:23:27.390 --> 02:23:29.730
<v Speaker 10>And that is the hallmark of session one.</v>

5094
02:23:29.731 --> 02:23:30.001
<v Speaker 10>Cooking.</v>

5095
02:23:30.001 --> 02:23:31.440
<v Speaker 10>That is the thing that's most amazing.</v>

5096
02:23:31.710 --> 02:23:35.730
<v Speaker 10>They took a couple ingredients but one especially is the red dried chili pepper</v>

5097
02:23:36.060 --> 02:23:37.800
<v Speaker 10>and just because of temperature.</v>

5098
02:23:38.610 --> 02:23:39.320
<v Speaker 10>Yes.</v>

5099
02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:40.153
<v Speaker 10>Hold on Brian.</v>

5100
02:23:40.260 --> 02:23:43.470
<v Speaker 10>I need to feel the energy just because the temperature just because of</v>

5101
02:23:43.471 --> 02:23:44.100
<v Speaker 10>temperature,</v>

5102
02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:48.600
<v Speaker 10>that one ingredient can become so many different things and it's like that,</v>

5103
02:23:48.990 --> 02:23:50.490
<v Speaker 10>that culture of cooking sesh,</v>

5104
02:23:50.491 --> 02:23:54.480
<v Speaker 10>one cooking in China pays that much attention to almost every ingredient</v>

5105
02:23:54.481 --> 02:23:55.320
<v Speaker 10>available to them,</v>

5106
02:23:55.620 --> 02:23:59.370
<v Speaker 10>but us now like our culinary revolution,</v>

5107
02:23:59.371 --> 02:24:04.371
<v Speaker 10>so to speak in America is such a like pho revolution to me like in other like</v>

5108
02:24:05.581 --> 02:24:06.001
<v Speaker 10>France,</v>

5109
02:24:06.001 --> 02:24:06.840
<v Speaker 10>you go to France,</v>

5168
02:25:43.170 --> 02:25:44.640

5169
02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:46.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like eating a Newport cigarette.</v>

02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:47.880
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of amazing.</v>

02:25:56.310 --> 02:25:57.143
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

5178
02:25:57.150 --> 02:25:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Now let me ask you this,</v>

5179
02:25:58.141 --> 02:25:59.950
<v Speaker 2>cause I don't understand chilies or peppers.</v>

5180
02:26:00.620 --> 02:26:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Why in New Mexico?</v>

5181
02:26:01.831 --> 02:26:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Why is New Mexico famous for Chili's?</v>

5182
02:26:03.721 --> 02:26:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Hatch Green Chiles.</v>

5183
02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:06.150
<v Speaker 2>What is the deal?</v>

5184
02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:08.190
<v Speaker 2>It's native to them and Chihuahua.</v>

5185
02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:09.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5186
02:26:09.090 --> 02:26:11.540
<v Speaker 2>but you can go screen breast screen her.</v>

5187
02:26:11.750 --> 02:26:12.300
<v Speaker 2>They'll like,</v>

5188
02:26:12.300 --> 02:26:13.790
<v Speaker 2>they cook them for you and they'll,</v>

5189
02:26:13.791 --> 02:26:17.250
<v Speaker 2>they'll freeze them and ship them to you and they're worth getting from New</v>

5190
02:26:17.250 --> 02:26:17.310
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>

5191
02:26:17.310 --> 02:26:18.143
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

5192
02:26:18.900 --> 02:26:19.681
<v Speaker 2>It's really cool.</v>

5193
02:26:19.681 --> 02:26:20.371
<v Speaker 2>Those reasons,</v>

5194
02:26:20.371 --> 02:26:24.210
<v Speaker 2>like New Orleans has the creole tomato that's only available for about like six</v>

5195
02:26:24.211 --> 02:26:27.270
<v Speaker 2>weeks out of the year and it's almost like a fruit tomato.</v>

5196
02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Then you have like the hatch green chilies in New Mexico,</v>

5197
02:26:29.671 --> 02:26:34.080
<v Speaker 2>like America has this amazing produce that's native to the country and it's cool</v>

5198
02:26:34.081 --> 02:26:39.081
<v Speaker 2>to go on the ground to these regions where they've played with it for hundreds</v>

5199
02:26:39.210 --> 02:26:39.570
<v Speaker 2>of years.</v>

5200
02:26:39.570 --> 02:26:40.860
<v Speaker 2>The hatch green shows,</v>

5201
02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:42.610
<v Speaker 2>what they were saying was that it was just not,</v>

5202
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:44.100
<v Speaker 2>it's not a super spicy Chili.</v>

5203
02:26:44.101 --> 02:26:44.761
<v Speaker 2>It's delicious.</v>

5204
02:26:44.761 --> 02:26:45.594
<v Speaker 2>Tastes delicious.</v>

5205
02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:46.733

<v Speaker 2>I wanted to talk to you about that.</v>

5263
02:28:11.761 --> 02:28:13.950
<v Speaker 2>I had a funny conversation with Jimmy Kimmel today,</v>

5264
02:28:14.250 --> 02:28:14.641

<v Speaker 2>That devil's watching.</v>

5267
02:28:19.550 --> 02:28:22.300
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] pulling scopolamine</v>

5268
02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:25.850
<v Speaker 3>means the same shit that they put in the patch to they give to people when</v>

5269
02:28:25.851 --> 02:28:26.684
<v Speaker 3>they're seasick.</v>

5270
02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:31.670
<v Speaker 3>My doctor told me that's Cupola mean is like regularly prescribed for people</v>

5271
02:28:31.671 --> 02:28:32.990
<v Speaker 3>that have sea sick when they have the path</v>

5272
02:28:33.330 --> 02:28:34.520
<v Speaker 5>in the different dosages.</v>

5273
02:28:34.521 --> 02:28:36.590
<v Speaker 5>Like basically what this cupola mean,</v>

5274
02:28:36.591 --> 02:28:37.341
<v Speaker 5>that is the,</v>

5275
02:28:37.341 --> 02:28:41.000
<v Speaker 5>is the Zombie drug is like the heroin level alkaloid,</v>

5276
02:28:41.210 --> 02:28:42.043
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

5277
02:28:42.260 --> 02:28:45.710
<v Speaker 5>And then this could pull the mean in the patches like the aspirin.</v>

5278
02:28:45.850 --> 02:28:46.700
<v Speaker 3>Well that's because,</v>

5279
02:28:46.750 --> 02:28:46.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5280
02:28:46.940 --> 02:28:47.190
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

5281
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:51.010
<v Speaker 3>the reason why I was bringing this up is a Jimmy Kimmel was telling me that him</v>

5282
02:28:51.011 --> 02:28:55.780
<v Speaker 3>and Adam Carolla had the patches on and they had a couple of beers and they</v>

5283
02:28:55.781 --> 02:28:59.950
<v Speaker 3>allegedly might've been around someone else who was smoking illegal marijuana.</v>

5284
02:28:59.951 --> 02:29:01.480
<v Speaker 3>They would not have partaken in of themselves.</v>

5285
02:29:01.810 --> 02:29:02.643
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they did,</v>

5286
02:29:02.650 --> 02:29:03.170
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

5287
02:29:03.170 --> 02:29:03.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5288
02:29:03.700 --> 02:29:06.940
<v Speaker 3>he said it was like he was living inside of a tin box.</v>

5289
02:29:07.420 --> 02:29:10.150
<v Speaker 3>He said he was fucked up and then totally new,</v>

5290
02:29:10.151 --> 02:29:11.200
<v Speaker 3>kind of fucked up.</v>

5291
02:29:11.830 --> 02:29:12.611
<v Speaker 3>Which makes sense.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I've seen the footage.</v>

5326
02:30:02.090 --> 02:30:03.170
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do the shoot,</v>

5327
02:30:03.171 --> 02:30:03.820
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

5328
02:30:03.820 --> 02:30:04.160
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

5329
02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:04.993
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

5330
02:30:05.160 --> 02:30:09.830
<v Speaker 5>a lot of how it works is prostitutes put these nose plugs up their nose and they</v>

5331
02:30:09.831 --> 02:30:12.890
<v Speaker 5>have like a condom or a balloon with some in it and they put in their mouth.</v>

5332
02:30:13.310 --> 02:30:14.570
<v Speaker 5>And then what they do is,</v>

5333
02:30:14.590 --> 02:30:14.880
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

5334
02:30:14.880 --> 02:30:16.490
<v Speaker 5>is when you go close,</v>

5335
02:30:16.491 --> 02:30:18.560
<v Speaker 5>they sort of blow it into your face and it's a ton of it.</v>

5336
02:30:19.070 --> 02:30:19.611
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

5337
02:30:19.611 --> 02:30:21.230
<v Speaker 5>but they have the like,</v>

5338

5341
02:30:31.371 --> 02:30:32.720
<v Speaker 5>taking all their money out.</v>

5342
02:30:33.130 --> 02:30:33.963
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5343
02:30:34.310 --> 02:30:36.140
<v Speaker 5>and because it's auto suggestive,</v>

5344
02:30:36.141 --> 02:30:38.420
<v Speaker 5>so you're in this sort of like trance like state and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>sort of a Zombie police in,</v>

5359
02:30:53.650 --> 02:30:54.483
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5360
02:30:54.530 --> 02:30:55.580
<v Speaker 5>in Haiti for the,</v>

5361
02:30:55.610 --> 02:30:56.990
<v Speaker 5>for those years under Papa Doc,</v>

5362
02:30:56.991 --> 02:30:57.360

02:30:58.521 --> 02:30:59.630
<v Speaker 5>that was the Zombie drug.</v>

5366
02:30:59.631 --> 02:31:01.250
<v Speaker 5>They call the Zombie Drug Devil's breath.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's got different names everywhere,</v>

5368
02:31:02.841 --> 02:31:04.700
<v Speaker 5>but it's like this auto suggestive drug.</v>

5369
02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:07.490
<v Speaker 5>What a strange side effect or effect of his,</v>

5370
02:31:07.530 --> 02:31:08.450
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>

5371
02:31:08.830 --> 02:31:09.400
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

5372
02:31:09.400 --> 02:31:11.710
<v Speaker 3>And this stuff is apparently very prevalent.</v>

5373
02:31:11.740 --> 02:31:12.011

02:31:14.421 --> 02:31:15.200
<v Speaker 5>it grows in America.</v>

5380
02:31:15.200 --> 02:31:15.381
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

5381
02:31:15.381 --> 02:31:16.730
<v Speaker 5>it's a sort of making,</v>

5382
02:31:16.731 --> 02:31:19.190
<v Speaker 5>it's like making a poppy into heroine.</v>

5383
02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 5>It's the same sort of</v>

5384
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:21.720
<v Speaker 2>process of making an alkaloid,</v>

5385
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:26.220
<v Speaker 2>but it's incredible that it's the same stuff that they use for sleep or for a</v>

5386
02:31:26.280 --> 02:31:27.030
<v Speaker 2>seasickness.</v>

5430
02:32:24.301 --> 02:32:28.110
<v Speaker 2>could just cover someone with those patches while they're asleep to start</v>

5431
02:32:28.111 --> 02:32:31.080
<v Speaker 2>sticking them all over their body and then they wake up and you're like,</v>

5438
02:32:37.830 --> 02:32:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Wonder if I'm fucking up because I suggested it and no one ever thought of it</v>

02:34:18.851 --> 02:34:19.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5503
02:34:19.330 --> 02:34:22.660
<v Speaker 2>This is after you guys had filmed that one piece that was exposing all the</v>

5504
02:34:22.661 --> 02:34:25.060
<v Speaker 2>weirdness about their restaurants and all that other shit.</v>

5505
02:34:25.090 --> 02:34:25.923
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5506
02:34:26.050 --> 02:34:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Same time or no,</v>

5507
02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:27.660
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5508
02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:31.530
<v Speaker 7>Twice and did documentaries and because I had been there,</v>

5509
02:34:31.531 --> 02:34:33.870
<v Speaker 7>I knew that they were crazy about a basketball,</v>

5510
02:34:33.871 --> 02:34:35.040
<v Speaker 7>but be the Chicago Bulls.</v>

5511
02:34:35.550 --> 02:34:38.550
<v Speaker 7>I can't go back because of my previous two documentaries,</v>

5512
02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:41.280
<v Speaker 7>but we knew that they love the Chicago Bulls.</v>

5513
02:34:41.281 --> 02:34:44.100
<v Speaker 7>So we tried to put them together again to go do a tour.</v>

5514
02:34:44.101 --> 02:34:49.101
<v Speaker 7>But no one would except for Rodman who is signing bay basketball cards in Denver</v>

5515
02:34:49.201 --> 02:34:50.034
<v Speaker 7>or something.</v>

5516
02:34:50.130 --> 02:34:51.330
<v Speaker 7>And so he,</v>

5517
02:34:51.331 --> 02:34:51.581
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

5518
02:34:51.581 --> 02:34:51.841
<v Speaker 7>he said,</v>

5519
02:34:51.841 --> 02:34:52.710
<v Speaker 7>I'll go and,</v>

5520
02:34:52.711 --> 02:34:53.101
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

5521
02:34:53.101 --> 02:34:53.580
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

5522
02:34:53.580 --> 02:34:55.800
<v Speaker 7>and obviously we need more people than just him.</v>

5523
02:34:55.801 --> 02:34:58.350
<v Speaker 7>So the globe trotters a agreed to go,</v>

5524
02:34:58.890 --> 02:35:00.660
<v Speaker 7>but we thought we didn't know he would show up.</v>

5525
02:35:00.661 --> 02:35:01.201
<v Speaker 7>We didn't know.</v>

5526
02:35:01.201 --> 02:35:04.440
<v Speaker 7>Like we thought like this would just be a way to get in and see some different</v>

5527
02:35:04.441 --> 02:35:05.040
<v Speaker 7>shit.</v>

5528
02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:08.580
<v Speaker 7>And then Kim Jong Goon showed up and then not only showed up,</v>

5529
02:35:08.581 --> 02:35:08.821
<v Speaker 7>said,</v>

5530
02:35:08.821 --> 02:35:09.031
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>

5531
02:35:09.031 --> 02:35:10.320
<v Speaker 7>come back to my house.</v>

5532
02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:15.180
<v Speaker 7>And everyone went back to his house and got absolutely loaded and you know,</v>

5533
02:35:15.300 --> 02:35:16.440
<v Speaker 7>talk to a bunch of,</v>

5534
02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:19.320
<v Speaker 2>is he the only one that's allowed to wear that haircut in North Korea?</v>

5535
02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:22.080
<v Speaker 2>Like what if somebody else wanted to rock that crazy haircut that Kim,</v>

5536
02:35:22.081 --> 02:35:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Jon Owen has theirs.</v>

5537
02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:28.520
<v Speaker 2>There's actually only seven haircuts that are allowed by the state and they have</v>

5538
02:35:29.911 --> 02:35:32.400
<v Speaker 2>to be done in a particular way like his haircut.</v>

5539
02:35:32.520 --> 02:35:35.490
<v Speaker 2>But pause that like back then Jamie Bam,</v>

5540
02:35:35.491 --> 02:35:36.324
<v Speaker 2>look at that haircut.</v>

5541
02:35:36.510 --> 02:35:36.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5542
02:35:36.631 --> 02:35:36.781
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5543
02:35:36.781 --> 02:35:37.471
<v Speaker 2>that would be a,</v>

5544
02:35:37.471 --> 02:35:38.550
<v Speaker 2>that would be a haircut.</v>

5545
02:35:38.620 --> 02:35:39.180
<v Speaker 2>Is that only,</v>

5546
02:35:39.180 --> 02:35:40.170
<v Speaker 2>you know what's interesting?</v>

5547
02:35:40.190 --> 02:35:41.150
<v Speaker 7>So he looks the,</v>

5548
02:35:41.151 --> 02:35:43.750
<v Speaker 7>one of the reasons why they picked him because uh,</v>

5549
02:35:45.230 --> 02:35:48.890
<v Speaker 7>Kim Jong Il had a bunch of sons cause he had a bunch of lovers,</v>

5550
02:35:48.891 --> 02:35:49.221
<v Speaker 7>whatever.</v>

5551
02:35:49.221 --> 02:35:50.270
<v Speaker 7>And this kid,</v>

5552
02:35:50.271 --> 02:35:51.920
<v Speaker 7>they weren't going to uh,</v>

5553
02:35:52.130 --> 02:35:55.850
<v Speaker 7>pick because he was educated in Switzerland and that's the back of west.</v>

5554
02:35:55.851 --> 02:35:56.660
<v Speaker 7>It's about,</v>

5555
02:35:56.660 --> 02:35:59.960
<v Speaker 7>but he had an older son who was picked up in like a Tokyo,</v>

5556
02:35:59.961 --> 02:36:00.780
<v Speaker 7>which is an a,</v>

5557
02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:01.820
<v Speaker 7>you just can't do that.</v>

5558
02:36:02.090 --> 02:36:05.850
<v Speaker 7>And another son that smashed a Ferrari and like Monaco and,</v>

5559
02:36:05.851 --> 02:36:06.441
<v Speaker 7>and you know,</v>

5560
02:36:06.441 --> 02:36:09.290
<v Speaker 7>in the poorest country in the world and they're fucking smashing Ferrari's</v>

5561
02:36:09.291 --> 02:36:10.124
<v Speaker 7>Monaco.</v>

5562
02:36:10.210 --> 02:36:10.580
<v Speaker 7>But he,</v>

5563
02:36:10.580 --> 02:36:10.700
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

5564
02:36:10.700 --> 02:36:15.700
<v Speaker 7>one of the reasons why he got in is because he looks exactly like his</v>

5565
02:36:16.191 --> 02:36:17.150
<v Speaker 7>grandfather,</v>

5566
02:36:18.410 --> 02:36:19.550
<v Speaker 7>Kim Il Sung,</v>

5567
02:36:19.910 --> 02:36:21.530
<v Speaker 7>who was the founder.</v>

5568
02:36:21.531 --> 02:36:22.230
<v Speaker 7>Like he was the,</v>

5569
02:36:22.230 --> 02:36:23.150
<v Speaker 7>the first of the,</v>

5570
02:36:23.151 --> 02:36:26.660
<v Speaker 7>he was drained by the Soviets and then he came down and he started the whole,</v>

5571
02:36:26.661 --> 02:36:26.901
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5572
02:36:26.901 --> 02:36:27.321
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5573
02:36:27.321 --> 02:36:29.420
<v Speaker 7>a cult of personality.</v>

5574
02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:31.281
<v Speaker 7>The original,</v>

5575
02:36:31.281 --> 02:36:32.114
<v Speaker 7>the original,</v>

5576
02:36:32.330 --> 02:36:33.350
<v Speaker 7>the original cumulus song.</v>

5577
02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:37.310
<v Speaker 7>And he looked so much like him that it's like,</v>

5578
02:36:37.311 --> 02:36:39.980
<v Speaker 7>it's like me being born looking exactly like Abe Lincoln.</v>

5579
02:36:39.981 --> 02:36:40.681
<v Speaker 7>They're just like this,</v>

5580
02:36:40.681 --> 02:36:41.241
<v Speaker 7>but he's the,</v>

5581
02:36:41.241 --> 02:36:43.120
<v Speaker 7>just put them up there and so that,</v>

5582
02:36:43.121 --> 02:36:44.920
<v Speaker 7>that's why they put them up there and now he's,</v>

5583
02:36:44.921 --> 02:36:46.700
<v Speaker 7>he's now he's purging the shit out of people.</v>

5584
02:36:46.910 --> 02:36:48.890
<v Speaker 7>It's probably not him purging the shit out of people.</v>

5585
02:36:48.891 --> 02:36:53.280
<v Speaker 7>It's the generals behind him getting rid of the other generals that oppose.</v>

5586
02:36:53.590 --> 02:36:56.950
<v Speaker 2>So these are the generals that were loyal to the previous administration,</v>

5587
02:36:56.951 --> 02:36:58.360
<v Speaker 2>his father's administration,</v>

5588
02:36:58.361 --> 02:36:59.320
<v Speaker 2>and they've criticized him.</v>

5589
02:36:59.321 --> 02:37:00.154
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

5590
02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:01.121
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5591
02:37:01.121 --> 02:37:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I think the uncle,</v>

5592
02:37:02.591 --> 02:37:05.470
<v Speaker 2>it has his own power sort of thing.</v>

5593
02:37:05.471 --> 02:37:06.304
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

5594
02:37:09.910 --> 02:37:10.770
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>

5595
02:37:10.771 --> 02:37:12.460
<v Speaker 2>So this is them getting rid of,</v>

5596
02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:13.413
<v Speaker 7>you know the,</v>

5597
02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:13.900
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

5598
02:37:13.900 --> 02:37:16.190
<v Speaker 7>the dowager sorta uncle talked</v>

5599
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:16.701
<v Speaker 3>a little too much.</v>

5600
02:37:16.701 --> 02:37:17.031
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

5604
02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:24.050
<v Speaker 3>Go a little out of line yourself.</v>

5605
02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:27.360
<v Speaker 3>Let alone yourself.</v>

5606

<v Speaker 3>Fucking Joe Pesci kills the guy got a little out of and stuff and Robert De Niro</v>

5608
02:37:33.921 --> 02:37:35.030

5609
02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:35.690

5613
02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:38.750

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5616
02:37:40.820 --> 02:37:42.320
<v Speaker 3>So he killed the fire.</v>

5617
02:37:42.340 --> 02:37:47.000
<v Speaker 3>They killed the uncle and then hired though the wife of the uncle gave her a new</v>

5618
02:37:47.001 --> 02:37:47.834
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>

5619
02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:48.920
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5620
02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:52.960
<v Speaker 7>Although I read something recently about the wife that now that's she,</v>

5621
02:37:52.970 --> 02:37:55.940
<v Speaker 7>she's been detained or you know,</v>

5622
02:37:55.970 --> 02:37:56.803
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>

5623
02:37:57.460 --> 02:37:58.970
<v Speaker 7>I didn't see that something's happening.</v>

5624
02:37:59.160 --> 02:37:59.401
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5625
02:37:59.401 --> 02:38:01.230
<v Speaker 3>I had also read that maybe the wife had a,</v>

5626
02:38:01.231 --> 02:38:02.200
<v Speaker 3>played a part in it,</v>

5627
02:38:02.430 --> 02:38:03.660
<v Speaker 3>that she was trying to get rid of him.</v>

5628
02:38:03.970 --> 02:38:04.521
<v Speaker 3>He was a fucking,</v>

5629
02:38:04.521 --> 02:38:07.380
<v Speaker 3>he was tired of her husband trying to stick it in her butt or something.</v>

5630
02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:08.430
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

5631
02:38:08.430 --> 02:38:12.410
<v Speaker 7>Kerry gave like a crazy interview about it to where he was just opened the</v>

5632
02:38:12.740 --> 02:38:16.730
<v Speaker 7>talking about how he's killing off people and,</v>

5633
02:38:16.731 --> 02:38:18.620
<v Speaker 7>and how it's making him nervous.</v>

5634
02:38:18.621 --> 02:38:21.440
<v Speaker 7>And it was interesting to see a diplomat just go</v>

5635
02:38:21.750 --> 02:38:22.890
<v Speaker 3>balls to the wall with it.</v>

5636
02:38:22.891 --> 02:38:23.131
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

5637
02:38:23.131 --> 02:38:23.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5638
02:38:23.310 --> 02:38:27.660
<v Speaker 3>remember when Carrie was like fucking sounding the war horns for Syria and the</v>

5639
02:38:27.661 --> 02:38:28.470
<v Speaker 3>entire government,</v>

5640
02:38:28.470 --> 02:38:29.610
<v Speaker 3>the entire country was like,</v>

5641
02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:30.473
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5642
02:38:30.870 --> 02:38:31.703
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5643
02:38:31.710 --> 02:38:32.640
<v Speaker 3>like no one,</v>

5644
02:38:32.670 --> 02:38:33.810
<v Speaker 3>not Fox News,</v>

5645
02:38:33.811 --> 02:38:34.860
<v Speaker 3>not CNN,</v>

5646
02:38:34.861 --> 02:38:36.630
<v Speaker 3>not fucking anybody was like,</v>

5647
02:38:36.660 --> 02:38:39.240
<v Speaker 3>this is a good move for America.</v>

5648
02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:40.710
<v Speaker 3>We need to go to war was here.</v>

5649
02:38:40.860 --> 02:38:41.491
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was like,</v>

5650
02:38:41.491 --> 02:38:41.731
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

5651
02:38:41.731 --> 02:38:41.941
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

5652
02:38:41.941 --> 02:38:42.180
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

5653
02:38:42.180 --> 02:38:45.060
<v Speaker 7>We need to go with a Russian Syria,</v>

5654
02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:46.980
<v Speaker 7>Russia on one side,</v>

5655
02:38:46.981 --> 02:38:47.450
<v Speaker 7>us on there.</v>

5656
02:38:47.450 --> 02:38:47.611
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

5657
02:38:47.611 --> 02:38:48.720
<v Speaker 7>we've seen where this ends up.</v>

5658
02:38:48.860 --> 02:38:52.460
<v Speaker 3>Is that one of the first times you've seen in your lifetime where the United</v>

5659
02:38:52.460 --> 02:38:52.790
<v Speaker 3>States,</v>

5660
02:38:52.790 --> 02:38:54.680
<v Speaker 3>the people literally said,</v>

5661
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:55.580
<v Speaker 3>fuck this.</v>

5662
02:38:55.700 --> 02:38:56.870
<v Speaker 3>And the government backed off.</v>

5663
02:38:57.010 --> 02:38:57.251
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

5664
02:38:57.251 --> 02:38:57.761
<v Speaker 7>for sure.</v>

5665
02:38:57.761 --> 02:39:02.200
<v Speaker 7>And it was such a black eye because actually Putin said,</v>

5666
02:39:02.230 --> 02:39:02.441
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

5667
02:39:02.441 --> 02:39:02.861
<v Speaker 7>I'll,</v>

5668
02:39:02.861 --> 02:39:07.000
<v Speaker 7>I'll negotiate this plank because they're backing Assad and we were going to</v>

5669
02:39:07.001 --> 02:39:07.890
<v Speaker 7>back the other side.</v>

5670
02:39:07.891 --> 02:39:09.580
<v Speaker 7>So it's a cold war fight again.</v>

5671
02:39:10.030 --> 02:39:14.440
<v Speaker 7>And Putin comes up with a peace plan and we were so embarrassed that we went,</v>

5672
02:39:14.530 --> 02:39:14.771
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

5673
02:39:14.771 --> 02:39:15.011
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

5674
02:39:15.011 --> 02:39:16.030
<v Speaker 7>we'll take your peace plan.</v>

5675
02:39:16.210 --> 02:39:19.240
<v Speaker 7>We'll take rush this bs plan who we were about to go to war.</v>

5676
02:39:19.370 --> 02:39:20.570
<v Speaker 3>He seems so reasonable.</v>

5677
02:39:20.571 --> 02:39:20.781
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

5678
02:39:20.781 --> 02:39:21.740
<v Speaker 3>and the peace plan too,</v>

5679
02:39:21.741 --> 02:39:21.981
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

5680
02:39:21.981 --> 02:39:22.150
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5681
02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:24.370
<v Speaker 3>get that guy who essentially the,</v>

5682
02:39:24.371 --> 02:39:27.540
<v Speaker 3>the czar of Russia is more reasonable.</v>

5685
02:39:30.190 --> 02:39:32.440
<v Speaker 7>One of the most unfriendly.</v>

5686
02:39:32.441 --> 02:39:34.690
<v Speaker 7>It has to be unfriendly and anti American.</v>

5687
02:39:34.870 --> 02:39:38.440
<v Speaker 7>Like what's interesting is that you would think that the cold war never ended</v>

5688
02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:43.750
<v Speaker 7>because you go there and the anti American anti-western rhetoric is crazy and</v>

5689
02:39:44.021 --> 02:39:44.854
<v Speaker 7>they blame everything.</v>

5690

5695
02:39:54.370 --> 02:39:57.370
<v Speaker 7>That's the American's flooding the shit with all their fucking gas and the</v>

5950
02:47:42.210 --> 02:47:45.030
<v Speaker 18>a man who was a terrible science fiction writer</v>

5951
02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:49.290
<v Speaker 2>who was quoted as saying that if you really want to control things,</v>

5952
02:47:49.291 --> 02:47:50.124
<v Speaker 2>start your own religion.</v>

5958
02:47:55.260 --> 02:48:00.260
<v Speaker 2>is it true that Scientology was started as a bet to see who could do the best</v>

5959
02:48:03.630 --> 02:48:04.230
<v Speaker 2>cult?</v>

5967
02:48:13.050 --> 02:48:13.940
<v Speaker 2>When you watch the bed,</v>

5968

5969
02:48:15.061 --> 02:48:19.020
<v Speaker 2>the actual history of Scientology is there look no further than the south park</v>

5970
02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:24.080
<v Speaker 2>episode because the South Park does it massive justice and they keep saying this</v>

5971
02:48:24.091 --> 02:48:25.200
<v Speaker 2>is the actual work.</v>

5972
02:48:25.230 --> 02:48:27.300
<v Speaker 2>Like they show you what they,</v>

5973
02:48:27.301 --> 02:48:28.710
<v Speaker 2>this is what they actually believe.</v>

5974
02:48:29.250 --> 02:48:30.480
<v Speaker 2>They also do that for Mormons.</v>

5975
02:48:30.481 --> 02:48:32.070
<v Speaker 2>And that's beautiful as well.</v>

5976
02:48:32.430 --> 02:48:33.263
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5977
02:48:33.650 --> 02:48:34.660
<v Speaker 2>what I mean it's,</v>

5978
02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:35.010
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5979
02:48:35.010 --> 02:48:36.390
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible science fiction.</v>

5980
02:48:36.570 --> 02:48:37.470
<v Speaker 2>It's just like battlefield,</v>

5981
02:48:37.471 --> 02:48:37.681
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

5982
02:48:37.681 --> 02:48:41.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like that movie that they made it the Travolta movie magically bad.</v>

5983
02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:42.091
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>

5984
02:48:42.091 --> 02:48:45.030
<v Speaker 2>And it was magic leap.</v>

5985
02:48:45.050 --> 02:48:48.300
<v Speaker 2>I think you put like 80 million of his own money and to make it,</v>

5986
02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:50.881
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

5988
02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:55.560
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad investment because the fucking movies dog shit,</v>

5989
02:48:55.561 --> 02:48:55.691
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

02:48:55.691 --> 02:48:55.940
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5991
02:48:55.940 --> 02:48:56.251
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5992
02:48:56.251 --> 02:48:56.911
<v Speaker 2>but it's good.</v>

5993
02:48:56.911 --> 02:48:57.361
<v Speaker 2>It's no,</v>

5994
02:48:57.361 --> 02:48:58.021
<v Speaker 2>it's so bad.</v>

5995
02:48:58.021 --> 02:48:58.410
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

5996
02:48:58.410 --> 02:49:02.400
<v Speaker 2>You need to just get really fucked up on an edible and sit through showgirls and</v>

5997
02:49:02.401 --> 02:49:06.630
<v Speaker 2>then when the edible really kicks into a strong peak and you're really worried</v>
