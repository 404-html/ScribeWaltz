00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

3
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's happenin.</v>

4
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Not much I'm excited to be here.</v>

5
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited to have you here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your father speaks very highly of you.</v>

6
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.830
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it like to have Jordan Peterson</v>

7
00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:22.780
<v Speaker 3>as a dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it weird you have to check yourself</v>

8
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:27.490
<v Speaker 3>constantly and make sure you're on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your unsteady ground and I say anything</v>

9
00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:28.090
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>

10
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.770
<v Speaker 4>No not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not at all.</v>

11
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.970
<v Speaker 4>I didn't realize it was weird until I</v>
<v Speaker 4>went away to university and then kind</v>

12
00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:37.150
<v Speaker 4>of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I just I was away for a while and</v>

13
00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:40.120
<v Speaker 4>then when I came back to the house</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially because the house is full of</v>

14
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 4>like paintings and masks and statues and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like 32 different paint colors and I</v>

15
00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:47.740
<v Speaker 4>came back and was like oh maybe he's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit eccentric.</v>

16
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.790
<v Speaker 3>Now he's definitely IG centric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking off air about what it</v>

17
00:00:54.791 --> 00:00:59.791
<v Speaker 3>was like to watch your dad become famous</v>
<v Speaker 3>and become famous and in his 50s right.</v>

18
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.190
<v Speaker 4>Like yeah I hope fifty four fifty five.</v>

19
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.170
<v Speaker 5>That's when he became famous before that</v>
<v Speaker 5>relatively unknown respected professor.</v>

20
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 5>One issue with this one transgender Bill</v>
<v Speaker 5>the the preferred pronouns bill and then</v>

21
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.233
<v Speaker 5>boom.</v>

22
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.140
<v Speaker 4>Off to the races.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah strange it was.</v>

23
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah it was super weird especially how</v>
<v Speaker 4>the media was portraying him and how</v>

24
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.480
<v Speaker 4>what was actually happening at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>events wasn't what was being portrayed</v>

25
00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:31.030
<v Speaker 4>in the media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was weird to watch and then</v>

26
00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 4>people recognizing him on the street is</v>
<v Speaker 4>strange.</v>

27
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.553
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

28
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.680
<v Speaker 3>When you say what what happened in real</v>
<v Speaker 3>life was not was what was being</v>

29
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:39.880
<v Speaker 3>portrayed like what was different.</v>

30
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Mostly what he was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So most of what he said is on film</v>

31
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.880
<v Speaker 2>anyway so you can go to YouTube and see</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's been saying like not there's</v>

32
00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:51.490
<v Speaker 2>not like some secret that's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

33
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.570
<v Speaker 2>But what's been portrayed has been so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more negative than what he's</v>

34
00:01:55.571 --> 00:02:00.571
<v Speaker 2>actually said or they'll take like sound</v>
<v Speaker 2>bites and just weave a story that isn't</v>

35
00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.370
<v Speaker 2>quite true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I didn't read for some reason I</v>

36
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.000
<v Speaker 2>know it looks silly but for some reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought that what the media was</v>

37
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:11.230
<v Speaker 2>portraying was honest always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah yeah me too.</v>

38
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not.</v>

39
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.190
<v Speaker 5>Well the writers you know and what's</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's real issue today that that issue</v>

40
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.940
<v Speaker 5>I've talked about this before but the</v>
<v Speaker 5>issue is clicks Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.900
<v Speaker 5>It's not just about what's the facts of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the story.</v>

42
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.930
<v Speaker 5>It's about these publications are</v>
<v Speaker 5>struggling to stay alive.</v>

43
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.920
<v Speaker 5>And one of the only ways that they can</v>
<v Speaker 5>get people to click on stories is</v>

44
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.250
<v Speaker 5>salacious headlines real make things</v>
<v Speaker 5>really click baby.</v>

45
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 5>And that's what they focus on and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>focus on negative aspects that are going</v>

46
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.480
<v Speaker 5>to get people riled up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have to have an angle.</v>

47
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.590
<v Speaker 5>And I've talked to people who are</v>
<v Speaker 5>writers who will write something and</v>

48
00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:51.910
<v Speaker 5>then I'll talk to them and I'll say Hey</v>
<v Speaker 5>man this is not what we talked about or</v>

49
00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:53.770
<v Speaker 5>what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they said I'm going to be honest</v>

50
00:02:53.771 --> 00:02:55.750
<v Speaker 5>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even write that the headline</v>

51
00:02:55.751 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 5>was completely written by the editor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the editor came and changed it all up</v>

52
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.890
<v Speaker 5>changed this switch put some dot dot dot</v>
<v Speaker 5>side of things you know.</v>

53
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.240
<v Speaker 5>So cut off sentences so that they seemed</v>
<v Speaker 5>more you know just more controversial</v>

54
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 5>than they really are because they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>allow the counterpoint of you know</v>

55
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 5>sometimes you say something and they say</v>
<v Speaker 5>or it could be this or the or it could</v>

56
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 5>be this part is cut out.</v>

57
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.930
<v Speaker 6>You know they do things like that just</v>
<v Speaker 6>to stay alive because I think when you I</v>

58
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 6>mean really big publications whether</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the New York Times or whether you</v>

59
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 6>know the Boston Globe like big</v>
<v Speaker 6>publications are struggling for their</v>

60
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 6>life right now because people who want</v>
<v Speaker 6>to buy newspapers anymore and you know</v>

61
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 6>and getting people to read things online</v>
<v Speaker 6>is very difficult and you have to you</v>

62
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 6>have to do something salacious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to do something that's enticing</v>

63
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:44.540
<v Speaker 6>for them to click on it.</v>

64
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.870
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Gasp and I wouldn't you say that's just</v>

65
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 7>driving them down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah yeah.</v>

66
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 7>Yeah they're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a bad place to be.</v>

67
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

68
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's you know it opens up</v>
<v Speaker 5>the door for alternative media.</v>

69
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 5>But some of those alternative media</v>
<v Speaker 5>sources don't have journalistic</v>

70
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 5>integrity either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that it becomes a real issue.</v>

71
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.520
<v Speaker 5>You know that's that's a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of online news shows.</v>

72
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.140
<v Speaker 5>It's like they take a very obvious</v>
<v Speaker 5>editorial spin as well on the news.</v>

73
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.680
<v Speaker 6>And if you just read or watch their show</v>
<v Speaker 6>you would go oh well it's this way</v>

74
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.830
<v Speaker 6>because these guys are saying it's this</v>
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>

75
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.720
<v Speaker 6>But it might not be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no real objective source is very</v>

76
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:32.950
<v Speaker 6>hard to find a good objective source.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean sometimes I count on the New York</v>

77
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 6>Times but there's been some things that</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've read from The New York Times that I</v>

78
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 6>know or not.</v>

79
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I think they had a terrible article</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Dad.</v>

80
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like June or something.</v>

81
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

82
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.240
<v Speaker 5>He didn't make it any easier on himself</v>
<v Speaker 5>by using that forced monogamy or term no</v>

83
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.630
<v Speaker 5>enforced monogamy argument or term</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I don't I don't even with the</v>

84
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 5>when you understand it as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychological concept that it is a</v>

85
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 5>culturally enforced idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I still don't think that applies to in</v>

86
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 5>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't I just don't you know only it</v>

87
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 5>makes any difference at all and he and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>discussed it on the podcast you're not</v>

88
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 5>just because you say it's a good idea</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the culture agrees it's a good idea</v>

89
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 5>for people to be monogamous I don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>necessarily think that that is going to</v>

90
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 5>help these guys at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we know what's going to</v>

91
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:25.120
<v Speaker 5>help those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah well obviously they're all</v>

92
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 5>individuals and their situations vary</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when we're talking about people like</v>

93
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are they talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a quote in The New York Times</v>

94
00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:38.821
<v Speaker 5>where this woman was asking him what to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do about these in cells which are</v>

95
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.970
<v Speaker 5>involuntary celibate and one of them had</v>
<v Speaker 5>driven a car into a crowd of people and</v>

96
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 5>killed a bunch of people because he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>frustrated because he couldn't find a</v>

97
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:50.194
<v Speaker 5>mate.</v>

98
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.530
<v Speaker 3>And your dad suggested that</v>
<v Speaker 3>if culturally enforced monogamy would be</v>

99
00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.690
<v Speaker 3>perhaps a solution for that and then a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of you went crazy saying that like</v>

100
00:06:01.691 --> 00:06:04.270
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's saying that women should sacrifice</v>

101
00:06:04.271 --> 00:06:08.620
<v Speaker 3>themselves fuck these guys that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't drive cars in the crowds.</v>

102
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.240
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

103
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.420
<v Speaker 3>It was the whole everybody made a</v>
<v Speaker 3>mistake.</v>

104
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.913
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

105
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't see there's an answer for those</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

106
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.270
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now with that but that is that those</v>

107
00:06:22.271 --> 00:06:26.920
<v Speaker 3>kind of articles are like the editorial</v>
<v Speaker 3>articles and opinion articles.</v>

108
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 3>It's really it's a different thing than</v>
<v Speaker 3>reporting on the news right.</v>

109
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I thought I thought so honesty was</v>
<v Speaker 2>always a big thing in our house and was</v>

110
00:06:35.321 --> 00:06:38.920
<v Speaker 2>like Don't lie because if you lie</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually the lie will surface and will</v>

111
00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:42.700
<v Speaker 2>be so much bigger than the how you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>from telling the truth.</v>

112
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.740
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of just assumed that the media</v>
<v Speaker 2>did that.</v>

113
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah the world just worked like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah no.</v>

114
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Now I know that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah</v>

115
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.810
<v Speaker 5>.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you and your dad a bolt on this wacky</v>

116
00:06:58.811 --> 00:07:03.811
<v Speaker 5>diet you're both on this wacky carnivore</v>
<v Speaker 5>diet and this is probably one of the</v>

117
00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:09.541
<v Speaker 5>most controversial things in our</v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship in relation to food today.</v>

118
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.370
<v Speaker 5>When.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When people discuss diets you know</v>

119
00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:19.540
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetarian or vegan or try and ketogenic</v>

120
00:07:19.541 --> 00:07:24.541
<v Speaker 5>diet or paleo but when you say carnivore</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is one of the ones where people</v>

121
00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:30.610
<v Speaker 5>just universally seem to like step back</v>
<v Speaker 5>roll their eyes.</v>

122
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.500
<v Speaker 5>Most people don't think it's a good</v>
<v Speaker 5>idea.</v>

123
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.120
<v Speaker 5>They don't even know why they don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>think it's a good idea.</v>

124
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.690
<v Speaker 5>And then you tell them about people like</v>
<v Speaker 5>you or my friend Chris Bell who has</v>

125
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.340
<v Speaker 5>similar autoimmune issues and he's had</v>
<v Speaker 5>hip to hip replacements.</v>

126
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.780
<v Speaker 5>He's only 36 now and I think he had both</v>
<v Speaker 5>of them done by the time he was 30</v>

127
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.670
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pretty sure because he's had them for</v>

128
00:07:56.671 --> 00:08:01.671
<v Speaker 5>quite a few years you know massive joint</v>
<v Speaker 5>pain of all sorts of issue and you when</v>

129
00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:05.610
<v Speaker 5>did you got a hip replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How old were you.</v>

130
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Seventeen and an ankle replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventeen.</v>

131
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Days is a rough year.</v>

132
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.090
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you so your whole life.</v>

133
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 3>You've had arthritis issues or.</v>

134
00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I started walking kind of funny when</v>

135
00:08:20.191 --> 00:08:22.650
<v Speaker 4>I was two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>According to my mom and she brought me</v>

136
00:08:22.651 --> 00:08:26.730
<v Speaker 4>to the doctor and they said just having</v>
<v Speaker 4>growing pains or something when I was 7</v>

137
00:08:26.731 --> 00:08:31.200
<v Speaker 4>I was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid</v>
<v Speaker 4>arthritis and I had like 37 joints</v>

138
00:08:31.201 --> 00:08:34.090
<v Speaker 4>affected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I was put on immunosuppressants</v>

139
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:34.860
<v Speaker 4>in Grade 4.</v>

140
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.910
<v Speaker 2>So I was actually the first kid in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada to be put on this biologic called</v>

141
00:08:38.911 --> 00:08:43.911
<v Speaker 2>Enbrel goes on and roll and methotrexate</v>
<v Speaker 2>for ever like leading up to the hip an</v>

142
00:08:44.701 --> 00:08:48.450
<v Speaker 2>ankle replacement and they did help</v>
<v Speaker 2>reduce some of the pain but I still</v>

143
00:08:48.451 --> 00:08:53.280
<v Speaker 2>ended up with no cartilage in my joint</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hip my hip and ankle when I was 17</v>

144
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:59.020
<v Speaker 2>and this is just from the effects of</v>
<v Speaker 2>arthritis and the inflammation swelling</v>

145
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 2>and just to the cartilage.</v>

146
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:07.190
<v Speaker 4>So I wasn't even particularly swollen I</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't have a very inflammatory visually</v>

147
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 4>inflammatory arthritis so my</v>
<v Speaker 4>rheumatologist who had been at Sick Kids</v>

148
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 4>for 20 years said that I had the worst</v>
<v Speaker 4>arthritis she'd ever seen.</v>

149
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.260
<v Speaker 4>So it was very severe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't particularly like swollen my</v>

150
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:25.660
<v Speaker 4>joints just disintegrated</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

151
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.920
<v Speaker 7>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What do they think causes something like</v>

152
00:09:27.921 --> 00:09:28.430
<v Speaker 7>this.</v>

153
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.230
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was.</v>

154
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Eventually after the hip and ankle</v>
<v Speaker 2>replacement the diagnosis was changed to</v>

155
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.240
<v Speaker 2>juvenile idiopathic arthritis.</v>

156
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.100
<v Speaker 8>So it was literally like we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 8>well.</v>

157
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.760
<v Speaker 5>And</v>
<v Speaker 5>how did you go from these medications</v>

158
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.120
<v Speaker 5>pharmaceutical medications to getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>into this carnivore diet thing.</v>

159
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.020
<v Speaker 5>What was this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This path.</v>

160
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.600
<v Speaker 4>Well OK I'll give you a background of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the path.</v>

161
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.760
<v Speaker 4>We were very like science oriented</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially dad.</v>

162
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:06.560
<v Speaker 4>So even though mom kind of wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 4>delve into diet and was like we should</v>

163
00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:11.210
<v Speaker 4>go sugar free or stop eating you know</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever make sure you'd whole grains</v>

164
00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:16.211
<v Speaker 4>like all that stuff we never gave diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A chance because there was no scientific</v>

165
00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:22.661
<v Speaker 4>evidence for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I basically got sicker and sicker and</v>

166
00:10:22.881 --> 00:10:27.470
<v Speaker 4>sicker and I ended up by the time I got</v>
<v Speaker 4>to university I ended up with arthritis</v>

167
00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.350
<v Speaker 4>I was severely depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was on anti-depressants as well.</v>

168
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.930
<v Speaker 4>I had idiopathic hyper Sonia I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleeping about 18 hours a day.</v>

169
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.040
<v Speaker 4>My whole body was itchy all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That started when I was about 14</v>

170
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:46.460
<v Speaker 4>and so that was when I started</v>
<v Speaker 4>university and then my diet just got</v>

171
00:10:46.461 --> 00:10:50.420
<v Speaker 4>disastrous in university and I was like</v>
<v Speaker 4>drinking all the time and eating like</v>

172
00:10:50.421 --> 00:10:51.650
<v Speaker 4>pizza and beer.</v>

173
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.160
<v Speaker 4>And I gained like 30 pounds in the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

174
00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.410
<v Speaker 4>And ginger ale a lot of ginger ale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway I gained about 30 pounds in the</v>

175
00:11:00.411 --> 00:11:03.230
<v Speaker 4>first year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My mental health declined even further.</v>

176
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.410
<v Speaker 4>And I didn't really know what was going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

177
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.790
<v Speaker 4>And then I started getting skin issues</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I started getting rashes cystic acne</v>

178
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:15.590
<v Speaker 4>and I was like OK I can deal with like</v>
<v Speaker 4>four really awful health problems but I</v>

179
00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:18.890
<v Speaker 4>can't deal with things affecting my skin</v>
<v Speaker 4>on top of that.</v>

180
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.400
<v Speaker 4>There's too many things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to dermatologists and they</v>

181
00:11:22.401 --> 00:11:27.401
<v Speaker 4>basically told me I was anxious and like</v>
<v Speaker 4>causing these rashes by itching so that</v>

182
00:11:29.331 --> 00:11:32.330
<v Speaker 4>was the dermatologists opinion which is</v>
<v Speaker 4>very unhelpful.</v>

183
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.890
<v Speaker 4>Anyway I spent a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was eventually prescribed Adderall for</v>

184
00:11:36.891 --> 00:11:41.390
<v Speaker 4>the hyper sommelier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I spent all my time googling reading</v>

185
00:11:41.391 --> 00:11:44.600
<v Speaker 4>papers trying to get a background on</v>
<v Speaker 4>skin disorders.</v>

186
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:50.470
<v Speaker 4>And eventually I came across this Celiac</v>
<v Speaker 4>Disease rash online and that's what I</v>

187
00:11:50.841 --> 00:11:54.770
<v Speaker 4>had it looked exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I cut out gluten.</v>

188
00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.640
<v Speaker 4>I read a whole bunch about the effects</v>
<v Speaker 4>of gluten on the guide and thought oh</v>

189
00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.640
<v Speaker 4>there's actually some evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 4>gluten isn't good for people why aren't</v>

190
00:12:01.641 --> 00:12:05.180
<v Speaker 4>people being told this like why didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>my doctor test me for celiac disease</v>

191
00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:09.100
<v Speaker 4>because Celiac Disease couples with</v>
<v Speaker 4>autoimmune disorders all the time like</v>

192
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.500
<v Speaker 4>they test type 1 kids for celiac</v>
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>

193
00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.770
<v Speaker 4>But for some reason they don't test kids</v>
<v Speaker 4>with arthritis for celiac disease.</v>

194
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.540
<v Speaker 4>So kind of gluten and that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>helped maybe like 20 percent but it was</v>

195
00:12:20.541 --> 00:12:23.270
<v Speaker 4>hard to tell because it was the summer</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like maybe I'm just feeling better</v>

196
00:12:23.271 --> 00:12:26.060
<v Speaker 4>from the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My rash kind of went down but it was</v>

197
00:12:26.061 --> 00:12:31.061
<v Speaker 4>still there and then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So September 2015 my mom dragged me to a</v>

198
00:12:32.241 --> 00:12:36.200
<v Speaker 4>natural path and they gave me the sheet</v>
<v Speaker 4>of foods like try this elimination diet.</v>

199
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.290
<v Speaker 4>And I looked at the sheet and thought</v>
<v Speaker 4>this doesn't make any sense like why can</v>

200
00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:43.260
<v Speaker 4>I eat lemons and not oranges and why are</v>
<v Speaker 4>almonds on there but other nuts are off.</v>

201
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.890
<v Speaker 4>So I cut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I thought OK I'm going to do an</v>

202
00:12:45.891 --> 00:12:48.230
<v Speaker 4>elimination diet which I didn't believe</v>
<v Speaker 4>in at all.</v>

203
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.980
<v Speaker 4>I'll cut down to what I considered safe</v>
<v Speaker 4>foods.</v>

204
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.250
<v Speaker 4>And I had no idea what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I just thought OK vegetables are</v>

205
00:12:55.251 --> 00:12:59.060
<v Speaker 4>pretty safe I'll get rid of nightshade</v>
<v Speaker 4>because people talk about them being bad</v>

206
00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:04.130
<v Speaker 4>like cheese was nitrates next to AIDS</v>
<v Speaker 4>like tomatoes eggplant those kind of</v>

207
00:13:04.131 --> 00:13:07.700
<v Speaker 4>foods for some reason there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just knew that they were then referred</v>

208
00:13:07.701 --> 00:13:11.570
<v Speaker 4>to as nitrates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like literally everybody has</v>

209
00:13:11.571 --> 00:13:13.170
<v Speaker 4>heard them referred to as Nightshade.</v>

210
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.450
<v Speaker 9>No.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Have you heard them.</v>

211
00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.280
<v Speaker 10>I've heard the term but not.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I couldn't tell you what it was.</v>

212
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.010
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't have been able to say it as</v>
<v Speaker 7>an eggplant so I think maybe it's just</v>

213
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.170
<v Speaker 7>kids don't make it to the end.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think so.</v>

214
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.220
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh okay.</v>

215
00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.280
<v Speaker 7>Well at the YouTube comments.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Decide.</v>

216
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.120
<v Speaker 7>Don't let them decide okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like calling demons for help too</v>

217
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.953
<v Speaker 7>good.</v>

218
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.680
<v Speaker 4>Anyway I cut down so I was eating mostly</v>
<v Speaker 4>like green vegetables.</v>

219
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:46.270
<v Speaker 4>I was still eating rice at that point</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I thought everybody eats rice</v>

220
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.000
<v Speaker 4>rice is safe and meat but I cut out like</v>
<v Speaker 4>dairy.</v>

221
00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:55.510
<v Speaker 4>Most grains soy sugar processed foods</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then in the next month my joints got</v>

222
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.840
<v Speaker 4>way better and my skin healed and my</v>
<v Speaker 4>skin never healed like for a couple of</v>

223
00:14:04.851 --> 00:14:06.880
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd always have these flare ups and</v>

224
00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:10.730
<v Speaker 4>never went away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was just on a like relatively</v>

225
00:14:10.731 --> 00:14:13.920
<v Speaker 4>low carb diet just like just less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

226
00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.580
<v Speaker 4>I was still eating rice right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was still mostly meat and</v>

227
00:14:16.581 --> 00:14:20.810
<v Speaker 4>vegetables and I thought OK maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something to this.</v>

228
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:26.050
<v Speaker 4>And then I made almond flour gluten free</v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar free dairy free almond flour</v>

229
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:32.060
<v Speaker 4>banana muffins and I ate a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>those one night and I woke up and the</v>

230
00:14:32.061 --> 00:14:34.550
<v Speaker 4>next day my wrists were sore and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought</v>

231
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.530
<v Speaker 4>OK maybe that's weird.</v>

232
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:42.740
<v Speaker 4>And then I had a bunch more than muffins</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the muffins were good and and</v>

233
00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:47.841
<v Speaker 4>then I went away to college that weekend</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I couldn't walk because of my knees</v>

234
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:52.680
<v Speaker 4>and I never had flare ups that badly</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I used to get my shoulder was</v>

235
00:14:52.681 --> 00:14:56.460
<v Speaker 4>always sore when I slept so I took</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tylenol three at night for sleeping and</v>

236
00:14:56.461 --> 00:14:59.730
<v Speaker 4>my wrists were stiff but I never had</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a flare up like I couldn't walk.</v>

237
00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.060
<v Speaker 4>So that was that weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then I went back to the diet and got</v>

238
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:11.180
<v Speaker 4>really strict with it and then things</v>
<v Speaker 4>were better like my skin was better I I</v>

239
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.190
<v Speaker 4>lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was weird.</v>

240
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:19.220
<v Speaker 4>I lost five pounds which wasn't a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I went down three pant sizes so it</v>

241
00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.860
<v Speaker 4>was all bloating that I didn't realize</v>
<v Speaker 4>was bloating because it never</v>

242
00:15:22.861 --> 00:15:26.250
<v Speaker 4>fluctuated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was the first month and then</v>

243
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.750
<v Speaker 4>2015 and then I started trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>reintroduce foods because I was having</v>

244
00:15:30.751 --> 00:15:34.290
<v Speaker 4>cravings and I missed going out to eat</v>
<v Speaker 4>with my friends and everything.</v>

245
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:39.450
<v Speaker 4>So I tried to read the first thing I</v>
<v Speaker 4>tried to reintroduce was sour patch</v>

246
00:15:39.451 --> 00:15:44.451
<v Speaker 4>Candy because I was having really</v>
<v Speaker 4>intense sugar look at me like that I was</v>

247
00:15:44.851 --> 00:15:48.410
<v Speaker 4>having really intense sugar cravings and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I looked at the packet and I thought OK</v>

248
00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:53.450
<v Speaker 4>no one's allergic to sugar there's no</v>
<v Speaker 4>dairy there's no gluten there's no soy.</v>

249
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:57.780
<v Speaker 4>This will be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I really wanted to eat them and I</v>

250
00:15:57.781 --> 00:16:02.781
<v Speaker 4>had those and the next day my whole body</v>
<v Speaker 4>was itchy again and it was like like</v>

251
00:16:03.361 --> 00:16:08.361
<v Speaker 4>mosquito bites everywhere itchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I thought OK maybe maybe that was a</v>

252
00:16:08.731 --> 00:16:10.590
<v Speaker 4>bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I waited a couple of weeks and I</v>

253
00:16:10.591 --> 00:16:14.130
<v Speaker 4>tried to reintroduce almond butter</v>
<v Speaker 4>organic almond butter because I wanted</v>

254
00:16:14.131 --> 00:16:19.131
<v Speaker 4>something fast protein fast and then I</v>
<v Speaker 4>had a slight abdominal cramping diarrhea</v>

255
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.960
<v Speaker 4>then this itch came back to Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ.</v>

256
00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:25.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

257
00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:30.420
<v Speaker 2>So for the next year</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'll slow down.</v>

258
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.660
<v Speaker 2>We've got some time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was that was the almond butter.</v>

259
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.400
<v Speaker 2>So then I waited a while and I felt</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty good.</v>

260
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.270
<v Speaker 2>This was November 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I started feeling really good</v>

261
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.770
<v Speaker 2>and I went off of my anti-depressants</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had been taking anti-depressants</v>

262
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:48.830
<v Speaker 2>since I was in grade 5 a really high</v>
<v Speaker 2>dose of an SSRI which had been very</v>

263
00:16:50.641 --> 00:16:51.474
<v Speaker 2>helpful.</v>

264
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.260
<v Speaker 1>But do you wean yourself off and do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>under a doctor's supervision.</v>

265
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.240
<v Speaker 2>No I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't right.</v>

266
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.190
<v Speaker 2>I weaned myself down so I went down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>half and then I went to a quarter and</v>

267
00:17:02.191 --> 00:17:05.410
<v Speaker 2>then I went to an eighth and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped taking how long to wait time.</v>

268
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.100
<v Speaker 2>It was nothing really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over two weeks it was two weeks.</v>

269
00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have withdrawal symptoms like I</v>

270
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.220
<v Speaker 2>think maybe I was lucky that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you died at this point was so at</v>

271
00:17:16.221 --> 00:17:20.750
<v Speaker 2>that point I was eating rice</v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally but it was mostly like</v>

272
00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:25.810
<v Speaker 2>broccoli salad chicken beef fish you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know olive oil apple cider vinegar salt</v>

273
00:17:27.591 --> 00:17:31.230
<v Speaker 2>pepper</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point I was also eating pears</v>

274
00:17:31.231 --> 00:17:35.820
<v Speaker 2>and apples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was kind of like paleo kind of</v>

275
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.670
<v Speaker 2>very restricted paleo dairy free.</v>

276
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.440
<v Speaker 5>And so you're feeling good you're off</v>
<v Speaker 5>your medication your joints feel better.</v>

277
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.480
<v Speaker 5>No more rashes no more rashes Yeah.</v>

278
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.960
<v Speaker 4>So everything seems to be improving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was shocked when the depression lifted</v>

279
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.920
<v Speaker 4>because I thought that runs in my family</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's familial we have some sort of</v>

280
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.490
<v Speaker 4>brain chemistry problem that can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly be diet.</v>

281
00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.960
<v Speaker 4>I thought I thought the skin maybe that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was diet because this gluten link and</v>

282
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:05.430
<v Speaker 4>then maybe because of the celiac gene</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I got tested for maybe the</v>

283
00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:08.670
<v Speaker 4>arthritis was part of that but I never</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought mood was associated with it.</v>

284
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:12.750
<v Speaker 4>So that was a surprise in November.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway I went off of the</v>

285
00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:17.610
<v Speaker 4>anti-depressants and then I'm about a</v>
<v Speaker 4>month later I tried to reintroduce soy</v>

286
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.060
<v Speaker 4>and this is when things started getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>really weird that year.</v>

287
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.560
<v Speaker 5>So I was having are you reintroducing</v>
<v Speaker 5>things if you're having all these</v>

288
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:26.880
<v Speaker 5>positive benefits.</v>

289
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.200
<v Speaker 2>I was having cravings like crazy and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would miss eating out and I thought</v>

290
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.460
<v Speaker 2>there were probably like four or five</v>
<v Speaker 2>foods I was really sensitive to and if I</v>

291
00:18:35.461 --> 00:18:37.890
<v Speaker 2>could just figure out what they were I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could eat pretty normally.</v>

292
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.140
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize like I didn't know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going on.</v>

293
00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.150
<v Speaker 2>If I had known I would have done it much</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

294
00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.340
<v Speaker 2>But I tried to reintroduce soy because</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point I still thought soy was a</v>

295
00:18:48.341 --> 00:18:53.341
<v Speaker 2>health food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I ate a huge meal of like at a mommy</v>

296
00:18:55.061 --> 00:18:59.800
<v Speaker 2>beans and bean sprouts and miso soup</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I made myself.</v>

297
00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.260
<v Speaker 2>So it was gluten free and soy sauce and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tofu.</v>

298
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.320
<v Speaker 2>I literally aid soy in every form and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had the same kind of reaction with</v>

299
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.530
<v Speaker 2>almond butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had immediately got bloated I had</v>

300
00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:14.850
<v Speaker 2>diarrhea like within maybe 20 30 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>of eating it.</v>

301
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.180
<v Speaker 4>And I thought OK that's OK I guess I</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't eat soy.</v>

302
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:23.660
<v Speaker 4>And then about four hours later my legs</v>
<v Speaker 4>got edgy and then my whole body got</v>

303
00:19:23.881 --> 00:19:27.570
<v Speaker 4>itchy and I was like OK that sucks I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>clearly I'm reacting to soy.</v>

304
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:33.110
<v Speaker 4>And then the next morning the depression</v>
<v Speaker 4>came back and it came back like that was</v>

305
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:36.990
<v Speaker 4>the worst depressive experience I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever had.</v>

306
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:42.420
<v Speaker 4>I was medication free and it came back</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the morning and I got in the shower</v>

307
00:19:42.421 --> 00:19:46.890
<v Speaker 4>and I just like I bawled in the shower</v>
<v Speaker 4>and thought how could I be so naive to</v>

308
00:19:46.891 --> 00:19:50.640
<v Speaker 4>think that my horrible auto immune</v>
<v Speaker 4>disorder and the depression and</v>

309
00:19:50.641 --> 00:19:54.450
<v Speaker 4>everything was caused by food like what</v>
<v Speaker 4>an idiotic thing to think how could I be</v>

310
00:19:54.451 --> 00:19:57.330
<v Speaker 4>that hopeful and then I had to remind</v>
<v Speaker 4>myself OK.</v>

311
00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:01.140
<v Speaker 4>No you ate a whole bunch of this food</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you had this like digestive</v>

312
00:20:01.141 --> 00:20:03.330
<v Speaker 4>distress then you got itchy.</v>

313
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.360
<v Speaker 4>And now the depression is back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's clearly a pattern here.</v>

314
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:11.760
<v Speaker 4>It was hard to think like that when I</v>
<v Speaker 4>got that depressed so that day was like</v>

315
00:20:11.761 --> 00:20:15.360
<v Speaker 4>I spent a lot of that day crying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the next day got worse.</v>

316
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:21.260
<v Speaker 4>And this is this is when it gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that night I went over to my parents</v>

317
00:20:22.711 --> 00:20:24.900
<v Speaker 4>and I was just like I don't know what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on right.</v>

318
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:29.100
<v Speaker 4>And they're like Well don't take a car</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to your apartment.</v>

319
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.090
<v Speaker 4>I said I don't think I can drive like I</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't I just can't think I don't know</v>

320
00:20:33.091 --> 00:20:38.091
<v Speaker 4>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my brother drove me home and I was</v>

321
00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.960
<v Speaker 4>like on the verge of having a panic</v>
<v Speaker 4>attack for no reason writers just like</v>

322
00:20:42.961 --> 00:20:45.540
<v Speaker 4>my heart rate was increasing I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to find my keys and I turned</v>

323
00:20:45.541 --> 00:20:49.860
<v Speaker 4>around to look at my brother in the car</v>
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

324
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:56.430
<v Speaker 4>his head was a like a kind of a demon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This</v>

325
00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.660
<v Speaker 2>I know how this sounds but he had like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>demon head for about a second and a half</v>

326
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.650
<v Speaker 2>and he looked at me and then he turned</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it was my brother again.</v>

327
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:10.150
<v Speaker 2>So standing is what your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For like a Yeah about a second and a</v>

328
00:21:10.151 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Speaker 2>half the hallucinations that year yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before that.</v>

329
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.010
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That year.</v>

330
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After this I'll get into.</v>

331
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.130
<v Speaker 1>So you eat soy and started tripping.</v>

332
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two days later.</v>

333
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I know how it sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it sounded to me too.</v>

334
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.630
<v Speaker 6>Have you found comparable stories.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>

335
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:35.110
<v Speaker 2>So obviously I did as much research as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could possibly do to soy no to gluten.</v>

336
00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.470
<v Speaker 2>To people who are schizophrenic from</v>
<v Speaker 2>gluten.</v>

337
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah there are people with celiac</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease who have schizophrenia induced</v>

338
00:21:44.181 --> 00:21:47.810
<v Speaker 2>by gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I found that but I didn't find</v>

339
00:21:47.811 --> 00:21:49.370
<v Speaker 2>anything for other foods.</v>

340
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:55.450
<v Speaker 5>But the skills of schizophrenia include</v>
<v Speaker 5>hallucinations rarely visual.</v>

341
00:21:55.970 --> 00:22:00.560
<v Speaker 2>But I did find a case study of a woman</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was seeing demons from her Celiac</v>

342
00:22:00.561 --> 00:22:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Disease gluten.</v>

343
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:05.060
<v Speaker 5>Now when you say you looked over and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>saw your brother and his head was a</v>

344
00:22:05.061 --> 00:22:10.061
<v Speaker 5>demon had like describe it like no I</v>
<v Speaker 5>found them.</v>

345
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:15.310
<v Speaker 2>No it was like eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when it's really dark in a</v>

346
00:22:15.311 --> 00:22:18.400
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if you've experienced</v>

347
00:22:18.401 --> 00:22:21.520
<v Speaker 2>this but it's really dark in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you kind of kind of see things</v>

348
00:22:21.521 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 2>in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>

349
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Speaker 2>It was more like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was dark at night and it was like I</v>

350
00:22:26.441 --> 00:22:29.440
<v Speaker 2>was so anxious so distraught.</v>

351
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.680
<v Speaker 3>You're a mess and maybe you just caused</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself to while something idea okay.</v>

352
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I mean I saw it like I can remember</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it looks like but it wasn't a vivid</v>

353
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.640
<v Speaker 2>demon or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like but it was there okay.</v>

354
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.300
<v Speaker 2>So you're freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so I'm freaking out so I'm like OK</v>

355
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.640
<v Speaker 2>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find my keys and I go upstairs and</v>

356
00:22:48.641 --> 00:22:52.120
<v Speaker 2>then I went into my bedroom and shut the</v>
<v Speaker 2>blinds turned on all the lights.</v>

357
00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:56.680
<v Speaker 2>And then like smoked as much weed as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could possibly smoke to try and calm</v>

358
00:22:56.681 --> 00:22:59.350
<v Speaker 2>myself down and then hid under the</v>
<v Speaker 2>blankets all night.</v>

359
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.910
<v Speaker 11>I would think that would be the worst</v>
<v Speaker 11>thing to do.</v>

360
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:01.750
<v Speaker 11>A demon.</v>

361
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:06.750
<v Speaker 2>You'd think that but then if you I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>had that comment before but enough and</v>

362
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.140
<v Speaker 2>it calm me down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

363
00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:15.810
<v Speaker 2>So then I spent the next couple of weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically stoned because I didn't know</v>

364
00:23:16.181 --> 00:23:18.880
<v Speaker 2>when it was going to end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what was going on and I</v>

365
00:23:18.881 --> 00:23:21.640
<v Speaker 2>couldn't find anybody on the internet</v>
<v Speaker 2>who had had the same experience as me</v>

366
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.940
<v Speaker 2>and then about two and a half weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>later it started going away.</v>

367
00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.990
<v Speaker 2>And so you say it.</v>

368
00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.040
<v Speaker 3>You mean the depression.</v>

369
00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.100
<v Speaker 4>Depression the arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't that just the depression that</v>

370
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.760
<v Speaker 4>came that's just just the words I know I</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't go back.</v>

371
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:41.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean I need soy again but I went back</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the initial diet.</v>

372
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:46.210
<v Speaker 5>I was eating so essentially just this</v>
<v Speaker 5>one meal this one great meal of soy</v>

373
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.590
<v Speaker 5>threw you off for a couple of weeks</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

374
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah like almost for like three weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>but after two weeks it started getting</v>

375
00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:56.780
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the symptoms were like So that's</v>

376
00:23:56.781 --> 00:24:01.310
<v Speaker 2>deplorable the itching started I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>bloating and then the depression came</v>

377
00:24:01.311 --> 00:24:03.320
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then about a week later my skin</v>

378
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:08.210
<v Speaker 2>started breaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe ten days later my</v>

379
00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:11.950
<v Speaker 2>arthritis came back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote all my symptoms down every</v>

380
00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:16.160
<v Speaker 2>day because I was going crazy and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know what was going on and I</v>

381
00:24:16.161 --> 00:24:19.050
<v Speaker 2>wanted to write it down to see what was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

382
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.890
<v Speaker 2>OK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I started lifting and I started</v>

383
00:24:21.891 --> 00:24:26.891
<v Speaker 2>feeling better again and I was like OK</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank God that's over and then waited</v>

384
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.830
<v Speaker 2>while things were good again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My symptoms went away.</v>

385
00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.360
<v Speaker 2>And then over the next year I tried to</v>
<v Speaker 2>reintroduce foods over and over and over</v>

386
00:24:35.361 --> 00:24:40.361
<v Speaker 2>again and I was making it like I tried</v>
<v Speaker 2>whey protein powder and that didn't</v>

387
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.070
<v Speaker 2>help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing ever got to as bad as that soy</v>

388
00:24:43.071 --> 00:24:47.090
<v Speaker 2>experience but I had a number of other</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences where it was the worst</v>

389
00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:52.091
<v Speaker 2>depression I've ever experienced and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was on the verge of seeing like I don't</v>

390
00:24:54.061 --> 00:24:56.760
<v Speaker 2>know seeing faces and things.</v>

391
00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:58.980
<v Speaker 3>So you're having all these health</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

392
00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.290
<v Speaker 3>How do you get to the carnivore diet.</v>

393
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:06.080
<v Speaker 2>So I decide about a year later I decide</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey maybe I don't want to keep cycling</v>

394
00:25:06.391 --> 00:25:09.480
<v Speaker 2>in and out of a horrible autoimmune</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental problems maybe I'll just stick</v>

395
00:25:09.481 --> 00:25:10.930
<v Speaker 2>with the original diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>

396
00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:16.460
<v Speaker 2>And then I got pregnant and so then my</v>
<v Speaker 2>auto immune symptoms flared again during</v>

397
00:25:18.171 --> 00:25:20.870
<v Speaker 2>the pregnancy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah like right away as soon as I found</v>

398
00:25:20.871 --> 00:25:24.080
<v Speaker 2>out I was pregnant it was like before I</v>
<v Speaker 2>found out I was pregnant that my</v>

399
00:25:24.081 --> 00:25:26.840
<v Speaker 2>autoimmune symptoms came back so my legs</v>
<v Speaker 2>were itchy again.</v>

400
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:29.840
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My joints were stiff my skin was</v>

401
00:25:29.841 --> 00:25:34.010
<v Speaker 2>breaking out my anxiety was back and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was hard to tell Well what part of this</v>

402
00:25:34.011 --> 00:25:36.470
<v Speaker 2>is pregnancy and what part of this is an</v>
<v Speaker 2>autoimmune disorder.</v>

403
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:42.620
<v Speaker 2>So throughout my pregnancy I cut down on</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the carbs I was eating so I cut out</v>

404
00:25:42.621 --> 00:25:47.540
<v Speaker 2>fruit and cut out sweet potatoes I went</v>
<v Speaker 2>down to meat and greens and I think dad</v>

405
00:25:47.541 --> 00:25:49.790
<v Speaker 2>was on here one time and he was on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat and greens diet.</v>

406
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.370
<v Speaker 2>So that was doing that part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're both on the meat and greens</v>

407
00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:57.371
<v Speaker 2>diet mostly because we didn't realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't need Greens to survive so we</v>

408
00:25:58.951 --> 00:26:03.951
<v Speaker 2>were eating meat greens and then I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say mostly because we realize you</v>

409
00:26:04.751 --> 00:26:06.420
<v Speaker 2>didn't well means we didn't love.</v>

410
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.530
<v Speaker 11>We didn't realize meat only wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 11>organized.</v>

411
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:10.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

412
00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:12.460
<v Speaker 2>We hadn't realized that we didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

413
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:17.230
<v Speaker 2>So as meat and salad it was very simple</v>
<v Speaker 2>salad with like olive oil apple cider</v>

414
00:26:17.231 --> 00:26:22.231
<v Speaker 2>vinegar salt pepper cucumbers lettuces</v>
<v Speaker 2>spinach pretty simple salad.</v>

415
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:28.380
<v Speaker 2>And then meat and fish so we did that</v>
<v Speaker 2>for about a year and then I had my</v>

416
00:26:29.451 --> 00:26:33.640
<v Speaker 2>daughter and then I didn't get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I found out OK.</v>

417
00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:37.040
<v Speaker 2>So these symptoms aren't really</v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnancy related it's just me now and</v>

418
00:26:37.041 --> 00:26:40.160
<v Speaker 2>for some reason I've lost the tolerance</v>
<v Speaker 2>to these foods I used to be able to eat</v>

419
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:44.270
<v Speaker 2>and and you're just eating salad and</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>

420
00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:49.130
<v Speaker 7>Yeah and I'm still having autoimmune so</v>
<v Speaker 7>now it's symptoms that you used to have</v>

421
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:50.023
<v Speaker 7>not in your reading.</v>

422
00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:54.500
<v Speaker 4>Not reason not nearly as bad not nearly</v>
<v Speaker 4>as bad like my fatigue wasn't back.</v>

423
00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.290
<v Speaker 4>My anxiety was manageable without</v>
<v Speaker 4>medication.</v>

424
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.620
<v Speaker 6>But you hadn't achieved the levels of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know that you had.</v>

425
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were eliminating things from your</v>

426
00:27:04.101 --> 00:27:04.934
<v Speaker 6>diet earlier.</v>

427
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:05.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

428
00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.990
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I reached a really good point and</v>

429
00:27:08.991 --> 00:27:11.180
<v Speaker 4>then I got pregnant and I couldn't reach</v>
<v Speaker 4>that point again.</v>

430
00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:17.380
<v Speaker 4>So then this is 2017 so it's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>November and I'm getting really</v>

431
00:27:17.391 --> 00:27:20.660
<v Speaker 4>frustrated about being itchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just randomly itchy again and</v>

432
00:27:20.661 --> 00:27:23.950
<v Speaker 4>randomly early read about eating meat</v>
<v Speaker 4>and veg just means salad.</v>

433
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought OK maybe I just have an</v>

434
00:27:27.411 --> 00:27:29.900
<v Speaker 2>autoimmune disorder and I can't control</v>
<v Speaker 2>it with diet anymore.</v>

435
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.770
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this maybe I'm just stuck like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

436
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.780
<v Speaker 2>And so I googled like out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>desperation.</v>

437
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:39.620
<v Speaker 2>I think I Googled allergic to everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>food wise something like that into</v>

438
00:27:39.621 --> 00:27:43.070
<v Speaker 2>google and I found the story about</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlene Anderson who's been mentioned a</v>

439
00:27:43.071 --> 00:27:47.360
<v Speaker 2>couple of times and she'd been diagnosed</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Lyme disease and has been eating</v>

440
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:52.420
<v Speaker 2>nothing but like red meat for 18 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are pictures of her family</v>

441
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.880
<v Speaker 2>online and I thought OK I know I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I Googled allergic to everything</v>

442
00:27:58.191 --> 00:28:03.160
<v Speaker 2>except meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I found her then I found that Shawn</v>

443
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.160
<v Speaker 2>Baker episode you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he'd been doing it for two years and</v>

444
00:28:07.161 --> 00:28:12.110
<v Speaker 2>I think that night I thought Screw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally have nothing to lose here.</v>

445
00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm only cutting out salad so that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I switched over.</v>

446
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:21.370
<v Speaker 2>That was December and then I switched</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and the itching got better pretty</v>

447
00:28:22.821 --> 00:28:24.560
<v Speaker 2>quickly like within the first couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

448
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:28.550
<v Speaker 2>But then my digestion just got totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>screwed up.</v>

449
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:33.560
<v Speaker 2>So like bloating and diarrhea every time</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat and after about a week I thought</v>

450
00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:38.810
<v Speaker 2>Kay this is a bad idea obviously</v>
<v Speaker 2>diarrhea every time you eat meat just</v>

451
00:28:38.811 --> 00:28:42.680
<v Speaker 2>meat just name and salt roast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

452
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.830
<v Speaker 2>So I thought this is a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously this isn't working my body</v>

453
00:28:45.831 --> 00:28:47.930
<v Speaker 2>doesn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I reintroduced salad again.</v>

454
00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:53.180
<v Speaker 2>It was literally lettuce apple cider</v>
<v Speaker 2>vinegar olive oil and salt and pepper.</v>

455
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:57.050
<v Speaker 2>That's what I reintroduced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I woke up the next day and the itch</v>

456
00:28:57.051 --> 00:29:02.051
<v Speaker 2>was back in my joints were stiff and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought OK if I have to choose between</v>

457
00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:06.530
<v Speaker 2>itching and arthritis or diarrhea I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to choose the diarrhea.</v>

458
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:07.880
<v Speaker 2>I was in a rough place.</v>

459
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:13.100
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I stuck it out and at six weeks of</v>

460
00:29:13.521 --> 00:29:18.521
<v Speaker 2>just doing this my diet the bloating</v>
<v Speaker 2>went away the diarrhea went away and</v>

461
00:29:18.531 --> 00:29:23.531
<v Speaker 2>everything started to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was mid-January but I was still</v>

462
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:27.120
<v Speaker 2>pretty skeptical because I thought I</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought maybe the reason the carnivore</v>

463
00:29:27.121 --> 00:29:30.900
<v Speaker 2>diet worked for people was because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just accidentally cut out everything</v>

464
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.960
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't working for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Processed foods sugar grains all that.</v>

465
00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:40.290
<v Speaker 2>So I tried to reintroduce all lives like</v>
<v Speaker 2>organic olives and all of oil.</v>

466
00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:45.540
<v Speaker 2>That was February and then I had this</v>
<v Speaker 2>itching came back with the depression</v>

467
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.590
<v Speaker 2>and my skin broke out and it was minor</v>
<v Speaker 2>in comparison to like soy.</v>

468
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:53.820
<v Speaker 1>So you think essentially to give us the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cliff Notes you're allergic to</v>

469
00:29:53.821 --> 00:29:58.821
<v Speaker 1>everything Yeah</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking crazy.</v>

470
00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.800
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then here's the thing.</v>

471
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:04.440
<v Speaker 2>I started this blog so the blogs don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat that.</v>

472
00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:09.030
<v Speaker 2>I started this blog because I thought if</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some reason there's someone else out</v>

473
00:30:09.031 --> 00:30:13.110
<v Speaker 2>there like me and they're Googling these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things it'd be nice for them to know</v>

474
00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:17.040
<v Speaker 2>that they're not alone right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've found other people like this</v>

475
00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.830
<v Speaker 2>who are equally as sensitive I'm sure.</v>

476
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.950
<v Speaker 6>I mean look if you exist there's</v>
<v Speaker 6>probably quite a few people that have</v>

477
00:30:22.951 --> 00:30:26.880
<v Speaker 6>that issue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And since it makes sense that we all</v>

478
00:30:26.881 --> 00:30:30.480
<v Speaker 6>have different tolerances and we all</v>
<v Speaker 6>have different allergies some people are</v>

479
00:30:30.481 --> 00:30:32.940
<v Speaker 6>allergic to cats some people have no</v>
<v Speaker 6>problem with peanuts.</v>

480
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:37.150
<v Speaker 6>Some people eat a brazil nut and they</v>
<v Speaker 6>die just yet.</v>

481
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.183
<v Speaker 6>We know this.</v>

482
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.720
<v Speaker 5>So the idea this is one of the problems</v>
<v Speaker 5>with diet is that people want to think</v>

483
00:30:42.721 --> 00:30:45.420
<v Speaker 5>that a diet that works for them works</v>
<v Speaker 5>for everybody and it doesn't work that</v>

484
00:30:45.421 --> 00:30:47.520
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And thing think people want you to</v>

485
00:30:47.521 --> 00:30:51.120
<v Speaker 5>follow their diet no matter what it is</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's vegan or paleo.</v>

486
00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:56.100
<v Speaker 5>People are very ideological with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would love you for you to do</v>

487
00:30:56.101 --> 00:30:59.160
<v Speaker 5>exactly what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So to reinforce what they're doing is</v>

488
00:30:59.161 --> 00:31:03.540
<v Speaker 5>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of pushback against this</v>

489
00:31:03.541 --> 00:31:08.541
<v Speaker 5>carnivore diet idea but I don't I I</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't think it's outside the realm of</v>

490
00:31:10.231 --> 00:31:13.710
<v Speaker 5>possibility that someone like you might</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually really be allergic to</v>

491
00:31:13.711 --> 00:31:14.544
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

492
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I mean I was like very sick and</v>
<v Speaker 2>from coming from that place to now I can</v>

493
00:31:20.371 --> 00:31:22.650
<v Speaker 2>see how sick I was and it was like I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying.</v>

494
00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:27.300
<v Speaker 5>You have a bunch of medication just</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to do anything with probiotics.</v>

495
00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tolerate probiotics you can't</v>

496
00:31:29.791 --> 00:31:30.930
<v Speaker 2>tolerate them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

497
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:35.760
<v Speaker 2>So the original idea was heal my God</v>
<v Speaker 2>repopulate with bacteria that maybe I'm</v>

498
00:31:35.761 --> 00:31:38.530
<v Speaker 2>missing and then maybe incorporate more</v>
<v Speaker 2>foods right.</v>

499
00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.460
<v Speaker 2>So what happened when I tried to do the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same autoimmune flare up.</v>

500
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.690
<v Speaker 5>OK but this is the same autumn immune</v>
<v Speaker 5>flare up that you got when you eat</v>

501
00:31:45.691 --> 00:31:46.524
<v Speaker 5>salad.</v>

502
00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:52.350
<v Speaker 2>No not quite not quite as bad not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was different.</v>

503
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:56.340
<v Speaker 2>It was like with salad there's more of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the arthritis.</v>

504
00:31:56.530 --> 00:32:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like body pain and then with</v>

505
00:32:00.331 --> 00:32:04.290
<v Speaker 2>probiotics would you get mood issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like really volatile.</v>

506
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:06.450
<v Speaker 2>And itchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

507
00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.580
<v Speaker 2>So I still got the itch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

508
00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:13.610
<v Speaker 2>So I think it was I probably had leaky</v>
<v Speaker 2>got into the program just going</v>

509
00:32:13.741 --> 00:32:14.190
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

510
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:18.090
<v Speaker 3>One of things your dad brought up to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was here was the most fires.</v>

511
00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I started reading up on it</v>

512
00:32:21.541 --> 00:32:25.890
<v Speaker 3>after he discussed it with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's something that I never even</v>

513
00:32:25.891 --> 00:32:26.700
<v Speaker 3>considered before.</v>

514
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:31.700
<v Speaker 1>But fast rising yeast and all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>different impulsive fires that they put</v>

515
00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:35.250
<v Speaker 1>in bread and wine and various foods.</v>

516
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're terrible for you.</v>

517
00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrible for your stomach in there.</v>

518
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.560
<v Speaker 2>They're so prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're everywhere.</v>

519
00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:42.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soy less often.</v>

520
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in everything it's in everything.</v>

521
00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:44.610
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

522
00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.310
<v Speaker 6>And then I started really paying</v>
<v Speaker 6>attention to it.</v>

523
00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.350
<v Speaker 6>I've read several articles on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then a couple of studies.</v>

524
00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:54.390
<v Speaker 6>It's it's crazy how this is something</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's never even discussed and it has</v>

525
00:32:54.481 --> 00:32:58.800
<v Speaker 6>all sorts of negative effects on your</v>
<v Speaker 6>gut and your gut lining.</v>

526
00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.540
<v Speaker 2>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

527
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Combining that and then it looks like</v>
<v Speaker 2>grains aren't so good for people.</v>

528
00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Combining that in grains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no wonder people are ill.</v>

529
00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Some people yes.</v>

530
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:15.230
<v Speaker 5>Some people most people though feel look</v>
<v Speaker 5>like obesity or I wouldn't go most I</v>

531
00:33:16.291 --> 00:33:19.080
<v Speaker 5>would say some let's say most people are</v>
<v Speaker 5>sedentary.</v>

532
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:20.830
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the primary Yeah.</v>

533
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.310
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think that's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean.</v>

534
00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:28.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean OK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say I mean I guess I'm not a great</v>

535
00:33:28.261 --> 00:33:32.010
<v Speaker 2>example but I mean people start gaining</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight if they're lucky when they're</v>

536
00:33:32.011 --> 00:33:35.100
<v Speaker 2>middle aged if they're unlucky when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're around 25 and they start gaining</v>

537
00:33:35.101 --> 00:33:36.830
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's from lack of exercise</v>

538
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.270
<v Speaker 2>I think it's from diet and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>diners let's do it.</v>

539
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:44.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's also lack of exercise.</v>

540
00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:48.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not convinced because people who've</v>

541
00:33:48.771 --> 00:33:53.660
<v Speaker 2>gone onto this carnivore diet especially</v>
<v Speaker 2>lose that weight.</v>

542
00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.900
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot of people out there</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are not overweight that don't</v>

543
00:33:56.901 --> 00:33:58.790
<v Speaker 3>follow the carnivore diet so how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>explain that.</v>

544
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Well I'd like to see anybody above the</v>
<v Speaker 2>age of 50 know on a standard standard</v>

545
00:34:04.641 --> 00:34:07.580
<v Speaker 2>American diet award is a standard</v>
<v Speaker 2>American diet.</v>

546
00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:09.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean you might say eating terrible.</v>

547
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.840
<v Speaker 2>No I just mean Standard American Diet.</v>

548
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:16.610
<v Speaker 6>I mean I saw I call it they gave me this</v>
<v Speaker 6>these blanket statements are a real</v>

549
00:34:16.611 --> 00:34:17.330
<v Speaker 6>issue.</v>

550
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons why your</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet is fascinating because like you</v>

551
00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:25.910
<v Speaker 1>know I don't think you can make blanket</v>
<v Speaker 1>statements when it comes to people and</v>

552
00:34:25.911 --> 00:34:28.190
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that I think there's some</v>

553
00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:30.090
<v Speaker 1>people out there that are damn food</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumpsters.</v>

554
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:31.850
<v Speaker 1>You could throw anything in there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fine.</v>

555
00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.540
<v Speaker 2>They just don't care unseemly issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then closer to that.</v>

556
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My brother is pretty well he's not so</v>

557
00:34:39.831 --> 00:34:43.280
<v Speaker 2>good with it like lactose but he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty stable compared to me anyway.</v>

558
00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.770
<v Speaker 5>Well you know Michael Phelps the Olympic</v>
<v Speaker 5>swimmer.</v>

559
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:46.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

560
00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:49.130
<v Speaker 7>It's like 10000 hours a day in several</v>
<v Speaker 7>pizzas.</v>

561
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:50.450
<v Speaker 7>Yeah I know.</v>

562
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:54.920
<v Speaker 6>I read about him fucking jacked has no</v>
<v Speaker 6>problems at all he's not fat.</v>

563
00:34:55.350 --> 00:35:00.350
<v Speaker 6>It's sad because it but that's an issue</v>
<v Speaker 6>of enormous like expenditure of energy.</v>

564
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.960
<v Speaker 6>I mean he's yeah absolutely exercising</v>
<v Speaker 6>in his body as ridiculous cowardly</v>

565
00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.230
<v Speaker 6>calorie requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah caloric.</v>

566
00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:14.720
<v Speaker 6>So yeah I mean it's it's hard to say but</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think sedentary lifestyle is a giant</v>

567
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:18.470
<v Speaker 6>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But most of what people do is what we're</v>

568
00:35:18.471 --> 00:35:20.480
<v Speaker 6>doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most of what people do is sit down.</v>

569
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.720
<v Speaker 2>But is that because they don't feel like</v>
<v Speaker 2>running around because some people like</v>

570
00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:27.140
<v Speaker 2>people who exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally you have to put in a little</v>

571
00:35:27.141 --> 00:35:30.080
<v Speaker 2>bit of effort to make yourself go</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise but a lot of people who are</v>

572
00:35:30.081 --> 00:35:33.890
<v Speaker 2>overweight and sick don't have enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy to do that.</v>

573
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:39.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them maybe but I think some of</v>

574
00:35:39.591 --> 00:35:42.500
<v Speaker 1>them just don't have discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an issue with that as well.</v>

575
00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:45.680
<v Speaker 1>There's also an issue of momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not used to doing it.</v>

576
00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not a part of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that you're</v>

577
00:35:47.721 --> 00:35:51.260
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to pushing yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been many many many many many</v>

578
00:35:51.261 --> 00:35:53.330
<v Speaker 1>many many days where I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work out.</v>

579
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:56.540
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't feel like I had the energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just forced myself.</v>

580
00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:00.020
<v Speaker 6>And I think there's very few people out</v>
<v Speaker 6>there that know how to force themselves.</v>

581
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.720
<v Speaker 6>That's a learn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah that's a learned skill.</v>

582
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:05.090
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That that kind of discipline and focus</v>

583
00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:10.250
<v Speaker 6>you have to have like real rigid</v>
<v Speaker 6>requirements of yourself where you don't</v>

584
00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:15.140
<v Speaker 6>allow yourself to back out of things and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't allow yourself to slack off.</v>

585
00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:19.910
<v Speaker 6>And I don't think people put those kind</v>
<v Speaker 6>of requirements on themselves as if it's</v>

586
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:25.780
<v Speaker 6>it is a a daily principle of life like</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you must get done.</v>

587
00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.090
<v Speaker 6>You know you must brush your teeth and</v>
<v Speaker 6>exercise for 45 minutes.</v>

588
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:33.560
<v Speaker 6>And if you did that I think you'd be</v>
<v Speaker 6>healthier and happier and your body</v>

589
00:36:33.561 --> 00:36:37.340
<v Speaker 6>would perform more smoothly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you require your body to do</v>

590
00:36:37.341 --> 00:36:39.920
<v Speaker 6>things like that I think it rises to the</v>
<v Speaker 6>occasion.</v>

591
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:43.040
<v Speaker 6>There are very few people that have that</v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of discipline.</v>

592
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:47.870
<v Speaker 6>So because of that they come up with</v>
<v Speaker 6>excuses and excuses are a giant part of</v>

593
00:36:47.871 --> 00:36:48.650
<v Speaker 6>the problem.</v>

594
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:53.330
<v Speaker 6>It's not simply a physical health issue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's also mental aspects of it.</v>

595
00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.390
<v Speaker 6>And discipline is a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just know way too many people who are</v>

596
00:36:56.391 --> 00:37:01.250
<v Speaker 6>weak mentally and I can't I can't just</v>
<v Speaker 6>chalk it off to only you know their</v>

597
00:37:01.251 --> 00:37:05.390
<v Speaker 6>physical though the way they physically</v>
<v Speaker 6>feel because I felt like shit 100 times</v>

598
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:07.550
<v Speaker 6>and then I worked out and then I felt</v>
<v Speaker 6>way better.</v>

599
00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:11.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah it's just it's just a fact of life</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's real.</v>

600
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.940
<v Speaker 6>You know you just get the idea and</v>
<v Speaker 6>people don't know how to do that.</v>

601
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.790
<v Speaker 6>It's all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you're used to doing this get in</v>

602
00:37:16.791 --> 00:37:21.791
<v Speaker 6>your car sit down drive to the office</v>
<v Speaker 6>sit down go to the lunch sit down you</v>

603
00:37:21.951 --> 00:37:25.910
<v Speaker 6>know go to the board meetings sit down</v>
<v Speaker 6>get in your car and on the way home sit</v>

604
00:37:25.911 --> 00:37:30.911
<v Speaker 6>down get home in front of the TV sit</v>
<v Speaker 6>down then go to the gym fuck off do not</v>

605
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:35.150
<v Speaker 6>have any energy you know their bodies</v>
<v Speaker 6>not the debate is like oh don't have it</v>

606
00:37:35.151 --> 00:37:39.860
<v Speaker 6>in me to do this and I don't believe</v>
<v Speaker 6>that I don't believe that I think it's</v>

607
00:37:39.861 --> 00:37:44.861
<v Speaker 6>it's a lot of it is the mindset so I</v>
<v Speaker 6>partly agree with that but because I</v>

608
00:37:45.081 --> 00:37:48.770
<v Speaker 6>know I'm like I was a very sick</v>
<v Speaker 6>individual a different case you have</v>

609
00:37:48.771 --> 00:37:52.520
<v Speaker 6>real legitimate diagnosed physical</v>
<v Speaker 6>issues.</v>

610
00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.600
<v Speaker 6>This is a very different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have a severe autoimmune disorder.</v>

611
00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:00.010
<v Speaker 6>I mean listen you get your hip replaced</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're fucking 17 yeah.</v>

612
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:01.700
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

613
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:05.660
<v Speaker 6>You don't hear that this is different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about the average fat fuck</v>

614
00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:09.200
<v Speaker 6>you just sit around being lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's really what it is.</v>

615
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:13.190
<v Speaker 6>It's like I'm sure a lot of it is diet</v>
<v Speaker 6>and a lot of that diet affects their</v>

616
00:38:13.191 --> 00:38:16.760
<v Speaker 6>physical health but there's been many</v>
<v Speaker 6>many people that have just put their</v>

617
00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:21.761
<v Speaker 6>foot down and said enough I'm gonna</v>
<v Speaker 6>change my life and they they don't take</v>

618
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:26.840
<v Speaker 6>an excuses and they feel way way better</v>
<v Speaker 6>diet is most certainly a part of that</v>

619
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:31.040
<v Speaker 6>but there's also a discipline aspect and</v>
<v Speaker 6>these things are not mutually exclusive.</v>

620
00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:35.930
<v Speaker 6>They exist together they're all together</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's and they work symbolically the</v>

621
00:38:35.931 --> 00:38:39.860
<v Speaker 6>way you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your mindset affects the choices you</v>

622
00:38:39.861 --> 00:38:44.861
<v Speaker 6>make with your diet and the mindset also</v>
<v Speaker 6>affects the choices you make in terms of</v>

623
00:38:44.871 --> 00:38:48.890
<v Speaker 6>like whether or not you require yourself</v>
<v Speaker 6>to exercise and I think these are these</v>

624
00:38:48.891 --> 00:38:53.630
<v Speaker 6>are critical aspects that people like to</v>
<v Speaker 6>gloss over or they like to make excuses</v>

625
00:38:53.631 --> 00:38:57.530
<v Speaker 6>about and they get very angry if you</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't accept those excuses.</v>

626
00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:02.710
<v Speaker 6>And that's a sign that they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're trying to enforce this standard</v>

627
00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:06.710
<v Speaker 6>in this idea and push it on you and give</v>
<v Speaker 6>themselves an excuse.</v>

628
00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.090
<v Speaker 6>It's one of the reasons why they get</v>
<v Speaker 6>angry.</v>

629
00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:12.200
<v Speaker 6>It's one thing if someone has a legit</v>
<v Speaker 6>physical issue like you do but there's a</v>

630
00:39:12.201 --> 00:39:15.020
<v Speaker 6>lot of people who do not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just have poor diet choices.</v>

631
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:20.240
<v Speaker 6>They have a sedentary lifestyle and they</v>
<v Speaker 6>have the momentum of this sedentary</v>

632
00:39:20.241 --> 00:39:21.590
<v Speaker 6>lifestyle that's holding them back.</v>

633
00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:26.620
<v Speaker 12>They're accustomed to being lazy OK I</v>
<v Speaker 12>kind of kind of agree.</v>

634
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I just from like my perspective I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen my dad and he was very like you can</v>

635
00:39:32.491 --> 00:39:35.980
<v Speaker 2>see from the videos from 2014 before he</v>
<v Speaker 2>started going low carb and everything.</v>

636
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:38.290
<v Speaker 2>He was carrying about 50 extra pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

637
00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.570
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't exercise and he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have enough energy to exercise doesn't.</v>

638
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.450
<v Speaker 2>But he didn't look at those lights</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

639
00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:45.323
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

640
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:47.400
<v Speaker 13>He just didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 13>No I I don't believe that.</v>

641
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:49.230
<v Speaker 13>When you say didn't have enough energy</v>
<v Speaker 13>to exercise.</v>

642
00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.093
<v Speaker 13>Did he walk around.</v>

643
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah.</v>

644
00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.570
<v Speaker 13>You want to drag yourself through things</v>
<v Speaker 13>and you can drag yourself through an</v>

645
00:39:54.571 --> 00:39:56.700
<v Speaker 13>exercise routine.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You can well you must.</v>

646
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:58.770
<v Speaker 13>You most certainly can.</v>
<v Speaker 13>He most certainly can.</v>

647
00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.930
<v Speaker 13>You don't have to do a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You have to do something.</v>

648
00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.150
<v Speaker 13>You walk up hills.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You jump a little rope.</v>

649
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.080
<v Speaker 13>You take a little tiny kettlebell you do</v>
<v Speaker 13>a couple cleans impresses you do a few</v>

650
00:40:07.081 --> 00:40:09.870
<v Speaker 13>pushups and do a few sit ups.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You get your blood pumping.</v>

651
00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:11.510
<v Speaker 13>You're moving.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You're alive.</v>

652
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:15.010
<v Speaker 13>You're exercising to say you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 13>enough extra energy to exercise.</v>

653
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.760
<v Speaker 13>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Can you walk to the refrigerator then</v>

654
00:40:17.761 --> 00:40:20.370
<v Speaker 13>you can exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I'm not saying that you have to run</v>

655
00:40:20.371 --> 00:40:23.520
<v Speaker 13>marathons.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You can exercise and everyone should</v>

656
00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:25.350
<v Speaker 13>fucking exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I agree.</v>

657
00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.360
<v Speaker 13>Everyone should exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Don't ever say.</v>

658
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.840
<v Speaker 13>People are so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 13>They want you to believe I don't have</v>

659
00:40:30.841 --> 00:40:34.250
<v Speaker 13>the energy to exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 13>God damn it everyone does if you're a</v>

660
00:40:34.251 --> 00:40:36.780
<v Speaker 13>liar.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I cannot say I believe that I've been</v>

661
00:40:36.781 --> 00:40:37.150
<v Speaker 13>there.</v>

662
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:39.990
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm a different case but I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen my dad there and then here's the</v>

663
00:40:39.991 --> 00:40:42.600
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once he fixed up his diet once he went</v>

664
00:40:42.601 --> 00:40:46.620
<v Speaker 2>to this corner of her diet he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercising now Choi's got less weight on</v>

665
00:40:46.621 --> 00:40:47.070
<v Speaker 2>his body.</v>

666
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.290
<v Speaker 13>He feels better and he has energy that's</v>
<v Speaker 13>wonderful.</v>

667
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.310
<v Speaker 13>He could have exercise then too.</v>
<v Speaker 13>He would've felt shittier for sure when</v>

668
00:40:53.311 --> 00:40:57.030
<v Speaker 13>it felt as good as you feeling now.</v>
<v Speaker 13>But to give people as excuse I don't</v>

669
00:40:57.031 --> 00:41:01.620
<v Speaker 13>have the energy to exercise that is</v>
<v Speaker 13>crazy to say Can you walk to the fucking</v>

671
00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.500
<v Speaker 13>You don't have to do anything crazy just</v>
<v Speaker 13>walk around the block.</v>

672
00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.920
<v Speaker 13>There's a there's 80 year old ladies who</v>
<v Speaker 13>take yoga with me they're fucking really</v>

<v Speaker 13>old and they're in there they're going</v>
<v Speaker 13>after it.</v>

674
00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.890
<v Speaker 13>They could easily say I don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 13>energy to do that but they don't.</v>

675
00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:22.230
<v Speaker 13>It's a mental attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 13>They make a decision.</v>

676
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:23.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I agree.</v>

677
00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:25.820
<v Speaker 13>Like there's a lot of it's discipline</v>
<v Speaker 13>you're gonna get people who just don't</v>

678
00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:29.220
<v Speaker 13>exercise to kill yourself you have to go</v>
<v Speaker 13>to a cross fit class and try to do the</v>

679
00:41:29.221 --> 00:41:31.890
<v Speaker 13>work out of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You'd have to go nuts and do clean</v>

680
00:41:31.891 --> 00:41:35.040
<v Speaker 13>impresses with 150 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You'd have to do that but you to do</v>

681
00:41:35.041 --> 00:41:39.570
<v Speaker 13>something just get your blood moving</v>
<v Speaker 13>your body has requirements it wants to</v>

682
00:41:39.571 --> 00:41:41.370
<v Speaker 13>move.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It really does and when it does you feel</v>

683
00:41:41.371 --> 00:41:43.290
<v Speaker 13>better.</v>
<v Speaker 13>But people like to give themselves this</v>

684
00:41:43.291 --> 00:41:45.390
<v Speaker 13>excuse I do not have the energy to do</v>
<v Speaker 13>this.</v>

685
00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:50.730
<v Speaker 13>Whatever you decide that that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 13>But if you watch a motivational video</v>

686
00:41:50.731 --> 00:41:54.760
<v Speaker 13>this 100 of them on YouTube thousands</v>
<v Speaker 13>even go watch one you'll get fired up</v>

687
00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:58.020
<v Speaker 13>like fuck it I'm going to jump some rope</v>
<v Speaker 13>you jumps from rope you do something</v>

688
00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.650
<v Speaker 13>just do some pushups do something do</v>
<v Speaker 13>some bodyweight squats you'll feel</v>

689
00:42:01.651 --> 00:42:06.630
<v Speaker 13>better but it's also like learning that</v>
<v Speaker 13>learning that and having that as a part</v>

690
00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:11.130
<v Speaker 13>of your daily life it has to be you know</v>
<v Speaker 13>again I'm not talking about someone like</v>

691
00:42:11.131 --> 00:42:14.820
<v Speaker 13>you who is in the throes of this</v>
<v Speaker 13>autoimmune disorder where you're getting</v>

692
00:42:14.821 --> 00:42:18.330
<v Speaker 13>your hip replaced at 17 I'm not talking</v>
<v Speaker 13>about someone with like serious</v>

693
00:42:18.331 --> 00:42:22.140
<v Speaker 13>degenerative illness I'm talking about</v>
<v Speaker 13>just a regular person who's overweight</v>

694
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.333
<v Speaker 13>you can do it.</v>

695
00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:27.990
<v Speaker 13>There's a lady who's like 450 pounds it</v>
<v Speaker 13>takes yoga with me she's enormous she's</v>

696
00:42:27.991 --> 00:42:30.780
<v Speaker 13>in there was probably really</v>
<v Speaker 13>embarrassing.</v>

697
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:34.700
<v Speaker 13>Very hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Yeah you know and she's in there did</v>

698
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:35.220
<v Speaker 13>you.</v>
<v Speaker 13>We could.</v>

699
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.480
<v Speaker 13>Anyone could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 13>We can do it.</v>

700
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:39.000
<v Speaker 13>And again I'm not saying do what Michael</v>
<v Speaker 13>Phelps does.</v>

701
00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.920
<v Speaker 13>I'm just saying just do something.</v>

702
00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.153
<v Speaker 1>Got to do something.</v>

703
00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.320
<v Speaker 13>We have fucked up lifestyles.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

704
00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:46.230
<v Speaker 13>The lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

705
00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:50.070
<v Speaker 13>We'll have are just the human body is</v>
<v Speaker 13>not designed to sit down all day and</v>

706
00:42:50.071 --> 00:42:54.360
<v Speaker 13>it's certainly not designed to be stuck</v>
<v Speaker 13>in traffic and be in an office and just</v>

707
00:42:54.361 --> 00:42:58.410
<v Speaker 13>be you know fluorescent lights sitting</v>
<v Speaker 13>there in front of a fucking computer</v>

708
00:42:58.411 --> 00:43:02.670
<v Speaker 13>monitor watching your soul get sucked</v>
<v Speaker 13>through the the LCD screen.</v>

709
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:03.833
<v Speaker 13>It's crazy.</v>

710
00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah yeah I agree.</v>

711
00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:10.680
<v Speaker 6>I think we've got to be really careful</v>
<v Speaker 6>with just the way we describe things.</v>

712
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:14.100
<v Speaker 6>It's like say I don't have the energy to</v>
<v Speaker 6>do something to fuck off.</v>

713
00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:15.143
<v Speaker 6>Stop.</v>

714
00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it still.</v>

715
00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.770
<v Speaker 2>That was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm still not convinced.</v>

716
00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:23.880
<v Speaker 2>You still know I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think you change your diet and</v>

717
00:43:23.881 --> 00:43:24.840
<v Speaker 2>then you can exercise.</v>

718
00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.640
<v Speaker 13>You can exercise without changing your</v>
<v Speaker 13>diet.</v>

719
00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.600
<v Speaker 13>There's a lot of people do.</v>

720
00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.950
<v Speaker 2>They do yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not as partly that's discipline.</v>

721
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes but partly that's being able to I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>still I don't know you haven't.</v>

722
00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:40.350
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think is holding them</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

723
00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Well I think if you're carrying around</v>
<v Speaker 2>extra weight like a quite a bit of extra</v>

724
00:43:45.991 --> 00:43:49.800
<v Speaker 2>weight and you say I don't have enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy there's something serious going</v>

725
00:43:49.801 --> 00:43:52.710
<v Speaker 2>on that isn't just oh I have a few extra</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>

726
00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we know exactly what that</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like but a lot of that has to do</v>

727
00:43:56.851 --> 00:43:59.730
<v Speaker 2>with energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean dad was sleeping here sleeping</v>

728
00:43:59.731 --> 00:44:03.330
<v Speaker 2>for two hours a day in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>day and he was impossible to wake up.</v>

729
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:07.120
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't wake up and like shake them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and couldn't wake him up.</v>

730
00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:12.140
<v Speaker 5>Dad told me he was on a standard diet of</v>
<v Speaker 5>legs sandwiches and pasta things on</v>

731
00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.050
<v Speaker 5>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah have that big insulin dump.</v>

732
00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:17.283
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

733
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah but I mean most people who don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have enough energy are in a lot of those</v>

734
00:44:22.411 --> 00:44:24.720
<v Speaker 2>people don't realize like we were eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole grains.</v>

735
00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.510
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know that whole grains were</v>
<v Speaker 2>just grains.</v>

736
00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:32.340
<v Speaker 2>We had the whole grains were healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was having sandwiches for lunch</v>

737
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:35.300
<v Speaker 2>because I was having cheese and bread</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was protein.</v>

738
00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:38.040
<v Speaker 11>Right your dad has autoimmune disease</v>
<v Speaker 11>disorders as well.</v>

739
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:39.770
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 11>A significant right.</v>

740
00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:44.370
<v Speaker 11>Crucial to the depression was at 17 if</v>
<v Speaker 11>that was the main one that was very</v>

741
00:44:44.371 --> 00:44:45.000
<v Speaker 11>significant.</v>

742
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah I think you know it's hard to do.</v>

743
00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.680
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to also figure out like what</v>
<v Speaker 3>is depression.</v>

744
00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:55.580
<v Speaker 3>We say no sign of depression to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>person doesn't have depression like</v>

745
00:44:55.581 --> 00:44:57.730
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear that and I go OK.</v>

746
00:44:57.830 --> 00:44:59.100
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah it does it.</v>

747
00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:01.310
<v Speaker 3>Mean you feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it mean does it mean there's</v>

748
00:45:01.311 --> 00:45:04.280
<v Speaker 3>like a thick wet blanket over your life</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can't get out.</v>

749
00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:07.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah it means like there's a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

750
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:13.640
<v Speaker 2>The closest it's it's impossible to</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of when you're not depressed but</v>

751
00:45:13.641 --> 00:45:18.020
<v Speaker 2>the closest I've get to is if you're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really really stressful situation and</v>

752
00:45:18.021 --> 00:45:21.710
<v Speaker 2>a whole bunch of things go wrong at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same time that's stress you feel is kind</v>

753
00:45:21.711 --> 00:45:24.680
<v Speaker 2>of like a really really mild version of</v>
<v Speaker 2>being depressed.</v>

754
00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Being depressed is like if you look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>something the colors seem muted you</v>

755
00:45:31.461 --> 00:45:36.461
<v Speaker 2>don't get joy out of anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This color the sky reds like just colors</v>

756
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:41.990
<v Speaker 2>everything's in gray scale kind of feels</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're walking through molasses and</v>

757
00:45:41.991 --> 00:45:45.860
<v Speaker 2>then you have a whole bunch of anxieties</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop up all the time that are like worst</v>

758
00:45:45.861 --> 00:45:50.861
<v Speaker 2>case scenarios of everything in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>entire life that won't happen but that's</v>

759
00:45:51.561 --> 00:45:56.561
<v Speaker 2>all you can think of all the time that</v>
<v Speaker 2>things partly anxiety but it's hell like</v>

760
00:45:56.590 --> 00:46:01.100
<v Speaker 2>I having arthritis I would choose</v>
<v Speaker 2>arthritis a million times over then this</v>

761
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.110
<v Speaker 2>depression just wrecks you.</v>

762
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:09.240
<v Speaker 3>So what leads you to the carnivore died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This lady has been living on it for 18</v>

763
00:46:09.241 --> 00:46:12.330
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You read about her and that she's still</v>

764
00:46:12.331 --> 00:46:16.350
<v Speaker 3>alive without eating and her Lyme</v>
<v Speaker 3>disease gone and she looks great.</v>

765
00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:17.740
<v Speaker 2>There's a before and after picture.</v>

766
00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:21.780
<v Speaker 3>She loves taking vitamins as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing nothing beef and salt.</v>

767
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.240
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is what you hear so this</v>

768
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.360
<v Speaker 3>anecdotal story is what leads you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>give that a try.</v>

769
00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:31.580
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah this is 2017 so December must.</v>

770
00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:33.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not quite a year.</v>

771
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:38.910
<v Speaker 2>So I switched over and then I had these</v>
<v Speaker 2>transient transition symptoms diarrhea.</v>

772
00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was basically it was craving.</v>

773
00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:44.330
<v Speaker 5>It's bold to hang in there with six</v>
<v Speaker 5>weeks diarrhea.</v>

774
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:47.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah but the alternative was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety and itching and arthritis.</v>

775
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.660
<v Speaker 3>Well you were also probably at the end</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your rope right where you're like Oh</v>

776
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:53.310
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said I can't even eat miso soup</v>

777
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.960
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

778
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.580
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing else like I don't care</v>
<v Speaker 2>about salad.</v>

779
00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.280
<v Speaker 2>I've already given up everything I love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take it away.</v>

780
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:04.590
<v Speaker 2>And then after six weeks it got better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I reintroduced all of not went</v>

781
00:47:04.591 --> 00:47:06.900
<v Speaker 2>badly and I thought OK I'm done with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reintroduction.</v>

782
00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:08.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm just sticking with meat.</v>

783
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Your dad said he's going to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reintroduce mushrooms Yeah.</v>

784
00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:17.050
<v Speaker 2>We'll see how that goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He seems to be weirdly sensitive to like</v>

785
00:47:17.051 --> 00:47:20.770
<v Speaker 2>in the same category as me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But instead of getting arthritis and all</v>

786
00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:24.190
<v Speaker 2>these other things as well he just gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>the depression which is the worst one.</v>

787
00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

788
00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:28.690
<v Speaker 6>he said he he introduced something to</v>
<v Speaker 6>his diet and he didn't sleep for like 24</v>

789
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:29.290
<v Speaker 6>days.</v>

790
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:31.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not even possible.</v>

791
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dead.</v>

792
00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:35.080
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it felt like I had the same</v>

793
00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.570
<v Speaker 2>weight I had the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ate the same thing.</v>

794
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.260
<v Speaker 2>I think it was sulfates in apple cider</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a stew I made.</v>

795
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it was.</v>

796
00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:48.580
<v Speaker 2>And yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was the edging came back</v>

797
00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:52.320
<v Speaker 2>and the doom came in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This depression came in and then.</v>

798
00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:55.570
<v Speaker 2>That's that's weird and it hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened very many times.</v>

799
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:59.260
<v Speaker 2>But I got stuck with insomnia and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>felt like we weren't sleep.</v>

800
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:01.000
<v Speaker 5>So you slept like a little bit and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>wake up.</v>

801
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Probably yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does not what it felt like but I'm</v>

802
00:48:03.611 --> 00:48:06.550
<v Speaker 2>sure you know it's not physically</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible to stay awake for that long but</v>

803
00:48:06.551 --> 00:48:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like sleeping.</v>

804
00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.030
<v Speaker 3>What's the world record that someone's</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever stayed awake.</v>

805
00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:13.180
<v Speaker 3>I think it's only like 10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah I think it's 11:00 10:00 or 11:00.</v>

806
00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah something along those lines.</v>

807
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:19.800
<v Speaker 2>God why would he do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it just a task version.</v>

808
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.610
<v Speaker 10>Eleven days and twenty five minutes.</v>

809
00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:25.540
<v Speaker 11>Twenty five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That's what it takes with that dude with</v>

810
00:48:25.541 --> 00:48:27.440
<v Speaker 11>Down a half deep.</v>

811
00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:34.920
<v Speaker 3>Wow that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I must unless you dad stomp the shit</v>

812
00:48:35.711 --> 00:48:36.730
<v Speaker 3>out of that world record.</v>

813
00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.810
<v Speaker 2>No I'm sure he was sleeping but it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was you know it didn't feel like</v>

814
00:48:40.811 --> 00:48:42.280
<v Speaker 2>that and it wasn't very much.</v>

815
00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:46.390
<v Speaker 5>It's just crazy that one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you remember what it was that he</v>

816
00:48:46.391 --> 00:48:49.320
<v Speaker 5>reintroduced to his dance that that was</v>
<v Speaker 5>might have been.</v>

817
00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.930
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a reintroduction it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were just still eating apples at that</v>

818
00:48:52.931 --> 00:48:56.200
<v Speaker 2>point and it was a cider and it had salt</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights at it and I looked at it and</v>

819
00:48:56.201 --> 00:49:00.250
<v Speaker 2>thought whatever it's like parts per</v>
<v Speaker 2>million sulphide it'll be fine</v>

820
00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.050
<v Speaker 2>and then that was the only thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was new.</v>

821
00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:08.820
<v Speaker 6>So do you think that as you get onto</v>
<v Speaker 6>this elimination diet and you start</v>

822
00:49:08.821 --> 00:49:11.340
<v Speaker 6>taking things out you get what you get.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

823
00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:16.400
<v Speaker 6>You get more sensitive cards like one of</v>
<v Speaker 6>things that that I noticed in a big way</v>

824
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:20.670
<v Speaker 6>was when I cut sugar out of my diet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I have sugar now like if I go crazy</v>

825
00:49:20.671 --> 00:49:24.740
<v Speaker 6>and have an ice cream sundae I hit a</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuckin wall so hard where I can't even</v>

826
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:27.420
<v Speaker 6>get up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>To sit down the cast my oh it takes like</v>

827
00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.060
<v Speaker 6>an hour or two for it to get out of my</v>
<v Speaker 6>system.</v>

828
00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:34.260
<v Speaker 6>So for like an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like oh God I feel like shit.</v>

829
00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.930
<v Speaker 7>And then two hours later I go OK it's</v>
<v Speaker 7>done.</v>

830
00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:38.670
<v Speaker 7>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's two hours.</v>

831
00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:41.550
<v Speaker 7>Yeah about two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like 24 days for me.</v>

832
00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh I believe you.</v>

833
00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:46.290
<v Speaker 3>I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for me it's just for two hours.</v>

834
00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:49.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean and again it's not I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed for two hours.</v>

835
00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.200
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like I have a brick in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>stomach.</v>

836
00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:55.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like I'm on a tranquilizer.</v>

837
00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:59.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah yeah yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So most of the that's how I lived all my</v>

838
00:49:59.851 --> 00:50:01.860
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No it's good tranquilizer like it's</v>

839
00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:05.310
<v Speaker 2>idiopathic hyper Sonia was like I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>falling asleep during exams.</v>

840
00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:09.720
<v Speaker 2>I drove home on the highway one time</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 22 and I was falling asleep</v>

841
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:13.320
<v Speaker 2>at the wheel and I was like Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't stay awake passing out.</v>

842
00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:18.150
<v Speaker 2>And I moved over into a lane and a truck</v>
<v Speaker 2>came by and honked at me and I was like</v>

843
00:50:18.151 --> 00:50:23.151
<v Speaker 2>home my God I'm going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I went on Adderall Whoa like I</v>

844
00:50:23.611 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 2>need to stay awake or I'm going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>RFE RL Oh yeah yeah.</v>

845
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm off of everything and the Adderall</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I stopped taking the</v>

846
00:50:31.201 --> 00:50:35.820
<v Speaker 2>immunosuppressants when I cut out gluten</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to see how my arthritic flare ups</v>

847
00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:40.850
<v Speaker 2>would go if anything would happen then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was then I got off the antidepressants</v>

848
00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:46.520
<v Speaker 2>November 2015 and then my fatigue lifted</v>
<v Speaker 2>in January 2016.</v>

849
00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.750
<v Speaker 2>So I got off the Adderall right away</v>
<v Speaker 2>then mm mm hmm.</v>

850
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:56.640
<v Speaker 2>I was taking a lot and it was great when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in that like feeling like I was on</v>

851
00:50:56.641 --> 00:50:59.670
<v Speaker 2>tranquilizers It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once you don't need it it's kind of</v>

852
00:50:59.671 --> 00:51:01.980
<v Speaker 2>awful being on that amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>amphetamine all the time.</v>

853
00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:07.230
<v Speaker 5>I know so many people are on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so disturbing to me how many people</v>

854
00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:11.880
<v Speaker 5>are taking that and talk about their</v>
<v Speaker 5>productivity and they're always it makes</v>

855
00:51:11.881 --> 00:51:13.620
<v Speaker 5>you feel like you're being productive.</v>

856
00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:17.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it actually makes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>more productive and it just destroys</v>

857
00:51:17.911 --> 00:51:20.550
<v Speaker 2>your short term memory does it destroyed</v>
<v Speaker 2>mine.</v>

858
00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I was taking a lot those on 40</v>
<v Speaker 2>milligrams a day on the morning long</v>

859
00:51:25.441 --> 00:51:28.800
<v Speaker 2>release this one of those things I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>always thought about trying I'm like</v>

860
00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:34.370
<v Speaker 2>maybe one day if you have energy if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have energy I don't think he gives you a</v>

861
00:51:35.461 --> 00:51:38.370
<v Speaker 2>kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're exhausted all the time</v>

862
00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:42.030
<v Speaker 2>it's just kind of unpleasant and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you like weirdly anti-social.</v>

863
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:44.323
<v Speaker 14>Mm hmm.</v>

864
00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:48.960
<v Speaker 3>OK so you haven't been on this died for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year now.</v>

865
00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:51.900
<v Speaker 3>What has changed once you got over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>diarrhea.</v>

866
00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:54.580
<v Speaker 3>What has the change been like.</v>

867
00:51:55.570 --> 00:52:00.160
<v Speaker 2>So the arthritis and like the auto</v>
<v Speaker 2>immune stuff went away fairly quickly</v>

868
00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:02.740
<v Speaker 2>when I was still having diarrhea and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>went away.</v>

869
00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:08.100
<v Speaker 2>The mood started to pick up six weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the diet and then in May so I'd</v>

870
00:52:08.681 --> 00:52:09.830
<v Speaker 2>been December driver.</v>

871
00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:13.750
<v Speaker 4>March April May.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So five months into it I had a huge</v>

872
00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:16.450
<v Speaker 4>improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So things just got better and better</v>

873
00:52:16.451 --> 00:52:19.600
<v Speaker 4>everyday and I finally got to the point</v>
<v Speaker 4>where I was pre pregnancy.</v>

874
00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:25.100
<v Speaker 2>So since May</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I would say it's still getting</v>

875
00:52:25.101 --> 00:52:27.060
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's only been three months.</v>

876
00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:31.640
<v Speaker 2>So you've been OK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No I've been OK since January but my</v>

877
00:52:31.641 --> 00:52:35.370
<v Speaker 2>mood went from like eight to like a nine</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half.</v>

878
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Like great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In May.</v>

879
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:41.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's feeling good after I started</v>
<v Speaker 2>after this first six weeks.</v>

880
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:47.770
<v Speaker 2>But then things got a lot better and may</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to be just improving now.</v>

881
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.630
<v Speaker 5>What kind of bloodwork are you getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>while you're doing all this.</v>

882
00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:55.070
<v Speaker 5>Are you going and getting tested for</v>
<v Speaker 5>nutritional deficiencies.</v>

883
00:52:55.120 --> 00:53:00.120
<v Speaker 5>Because one of the issues that many</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are nutritionists or who are</v>

884
00:53:00.711 --> 00:53:05.711
<v Speaker 5>studying biology have with this</v>
<v Speaker 5>carnivore diet is that meat just meat is</v>

885
00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:09.350
<v Speaker 5>very deficient in many many nutrients.</v>

886
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:14.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just it's very deficient in vitamin</v>
<v Speaker 1>C is deficient in several things that we</v>

887
00:53:15.081 --> 00:53:18.110
<v Speaker 1>think that you need in order to to live.</v>

888
00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah well I did get bloodwork done</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people were asking and not</v>

889
00:53:22.641 --> 00:53:26.360
<v Speaker 2>because I particularly trust bloodwork</v>
<v Speaker 2>because my bloodwork was always pretty</v>

890
00:53:26.361 --> 00:53:28.510
<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always low in zinc and vitamin D</v>

891
00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:29.330
<v Speaker 2>since I was a kid.</v>

892
00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Even when you had severe arthritis.</v>

893
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything was normal.</v>

894
00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:36.110
<v Speaker 2>I had no blood markers and I was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying but Jesus.</v>

895
00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:39.970
<v Speaker 2>What about for inflammation my white</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood cell count was high.</v>

896
00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Give me a sign of infection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

897
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:45.740
<v Speaker 2>So that was high my vitamin D and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>zinc were low.</v>

898
00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not what showed up.</v>

899
00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:49.970
<v Speaker 5>But that wouldn't be normal right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you went and you got your blood</v>

900
00:53:49.971 --> 00:53:52.550
<v Speaker 5>tested and they showed you you have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>high white blood cell count that would</v>

901
00:53:52.551 --> 00:53:53.660
<v Speaker 5>go there's an issue here.</v>

902
00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:58.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't abnormal enough to have caused</v>

903
00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:03.410
<v Speaker 2>the problems I was experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how about how how different was it</v>

904
00:54:03.411 --> 00:54:08.411
<v Speaker 2>from the normal white blood cell count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I had white bloods raised white</v>

905
00:54:08.961 --> 00:54:11.870
<v Speaker 2>blood cell count and I had white blood</v>
<v Speaker 2>cells in my urine.</v>

906
00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:17.300
<v Speaker 2>And that's that's a little weird because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is generally like while some sort</v>

907
00:54:17.301 --> 00:54:20.240
<v Speaker 2>of bacterial infection which I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have symptoms of.</v>

908
00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was a little weird but that was</v>

909
00:54:23.661 --> 00:54:25.850
<v Speaker 2>never focused on from the doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not.</v>

910
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:28.130
<v Speaker 6>Well that seems like that's that's an</v>
<v Speaker 6>issue.</v>

911
00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.760
<v Speaker 6>If normal people don't have that and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>have problems that normal people don't</v>

912
00:54:31.761 --> 00:54:34.460
<v Speaker 6>have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say my blood work is not.</v>

913
00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:37.070
<v Speaker 6>I mean your blood work is not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not normal.</v>

914
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:40.940
<v Speaker 2>No but I mean I was on all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>medications they could put me on.</v>

915
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:45.470
<v Speaker 2>So there wasn't and they never looked at</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet so I was kind of at a standstill.</v>

916
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:48.290
<v Speaker 5>Well but you when you said that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't trust blood work and then.</v>

917
00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Well I did get it done right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly for the blog so that everybody</v>

918
00:54:51.231 --> 00:54:53.650
<v Speaker 2>could see I wasn't dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can pull it up.</v>

919
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.870
<v Speaker 6>OK.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was one of the issues with Shaun</v>

920
00:54:56.871 --> 00:54:59.300
<v Speaker 6>Baker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shawn got his blood work done and one of</v>

921
00:54:59.301 --> 00:55:02.270
<v Speaker 6>the things that people noticed is that</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's quite a few issues there.</v>

922
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:06.110
<v Speaker 6>And one of them was very very low</v>
<v Speaker 6>testosterone which is crazy because he's</v>

923
00:55:06.111 --> 00:55:10.010
<v Speaker 6>a gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah he's a big huge 6 foot 5 250 pound</v>

924
00:55:10.011 --> 00:55:11.930
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's like well he didn't look</v>

925
00:55:11.931 --> 00:55:14.390
<v Speaker 6>deficient in testosterone like what the</v>
<v Speaker 6>hell is going on here.</v>

926
00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I don't have testosterone readings.</v>

927
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:20.780
<v Speaker 6>He also said that part of that might you</v>
<v Speaker 6>know he I have gone back and forth about</v>

928
00:55:20.781 --> 00:55:21.920
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said part of that might have been</v>

929
00:55:21.921 --> 00:55:26.921
<v Speaker 6>that had to do with taking the test when</v>
<v Speaker 6>he had done a very heavy weight lifting</v>

930
00:55:29.031 --> 00:55:31.760
<v Speaker 6>workout the day before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If he'd done squats and deadlifts and</v>

931
00:55:31.761 --> 00:55:34.310
<v Speaker 6>all kinds of stuff and so maybe broke</v>
<v Speaker 6>his body down a bit.</v>

932
00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of makes sense.</v>

933
00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:38.750
<v Speaker 2>I'll be nice first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a medical professional to take some</v>

934
00:55:38.751 --> 00:55:41.840
<v Speaker 2>of these groups of people doing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet and just do a study.</v>

935
00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we could actually get some</v>

936
00:55:43.281 --> 00:55:44.390
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

937
00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Instead of like everything's anecdotal</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I put my stuff up but just because</v>

938
00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:52.490
<v Speaker 2>so I can show it to you but everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>is normal.</v>

939
00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Everything is normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Farrington is slightly slightly</v>

940
00:55:56.901 --> 00:56:01.080
<v Speaker 2>elevated but like fair it's an iron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>OK.</v>

941
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:05.290
<v Speaker 2>So that's slightly elevated because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're eating a little lightly red meat</v>

942
00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:08.480
<v Speaker 2>but that's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily.</v>

943
00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:12.140
<v Speaker 2>And it was still like my doctor said he</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't care it wasn't elevated enough</v>

944
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:17.470
<v Speaker 2>but like what about vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for vitamins</v>

945
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:24.680
<v Speaker 2>vitamins my zinc is still low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Vitamin D still low that hasn't</v>

946
00:56:24.781 --> 00:56:27.570
<v Speaker 2>recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been like that and it's been like</v>

947
00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:30.840
<v Speaker 2>out forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's hard in Canada like I have</v>

948
00:56:30.841 --> 00:56:34.560
<v Speaker 2>some pictures on Instagram and I'm Green</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's no light for like six</v>

949
00:56:34.561 --> 00:56:39.561
<v Speaker 2>months</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm outside all summer so I'm</v>

950
00:56:41.011 --> 00:56:45.330
<v Speaker 2>probably deficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that has something to do with</v>

951
00:56:45.331 --> 00:56:48.180
<v Speaker 2>the auto immune disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried supplementing with really high</v>

952
00:56:48.181 --> 00:56:50.100
<v Speaker 2>dose vitamin D and didn't see any</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits.</v>

953
00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:54.190
<v Speaker 2>So I hope I don't take supplements</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

954
00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:56.280
<v Speaker 2>The high dose vitamin D.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

955
00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:01.840
<v Speaker 2>I tried once when I was 21 for about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year and then again when I was doing on</v>

956
00:57:02.091 --> 00:57:03.140
<v Speaker 2>the low carb diet.</v>

957
00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:07.010
<v Speaker 5>Well what about now when you're issues</v>
<v Speaker 5>with vitamin D or in your blood.</v>

958
00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Just got my bloodwork back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay so I was doing no no supplements so</v>

959
00:57:10.941 --> 00:57:12.170
<v Speaker 2>that I could see what happened.</v>

960
00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Also I wouldn't recommend high dose of</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin D.</v>

961
00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh just recommend supplementing with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal dose of vitamin D.</v>

962
00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:24.950
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm just going to wait and see</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get tested in a year.</v>

963
00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:29.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm not too concerned and see what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens because here's here's what's</v>

964
00:57:29.091 --> 00:57:32.060
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I went to the low carb diet my B</v>

965
00:57:32.061 --> 00:57:34.490
<v Speaker 2>vitamins were low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was during the pregnancy I got</v>

966
00:57:34.491 --> 00:57:39.260
<v Speaker 2>this first test and it was my b twelve</v>
<v Speaker 2>was fine but everything else was low</v>

967
00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:44.290
<v Speaker 2>folate was low B one B three B six and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Biogen were all low on the low carb</v>

968
00:57:45.561 --> 00:57:48.770
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right on my natural path said maybe you</v>

969
00:57:48.771 --> 00:57:53.270
<v Speaker 2>have a microbiome problem whatever that</v>
<v Speaker 2>means whenever someone says my natural</v>

970
00:57:53.271 --> 00:57:56.120
<v Speaker 2>process they just go Oh yeah.</v>

971
00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:58.220
<v Speaker 7>What else.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like need a costume like that.</v>

972
00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:01.100
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Crystal with you at all times.</v>

973
00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:06.380
<v Speaker 2>You know what they were they're telling</v>
<v Speaker 2>me to cut out gluten for years and I was</v>

974
00:58:06.381 --> 00:58:09.140
<v Speaker 2>like What do you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right crazy person.</v>

975
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I could have probably stopped you</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to stop some pressure on your wall</v>

976
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:15.920
<v Speaker 2>put a Jewish culture above your bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll help.</v>

977
00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway this new micro nutrients test the</v>

978
00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:26.500
<v Speaker 2>vitamin D and count not calcium vitamin</v>
<v Speaker 2>D and zinc are still low but all my bees</v>

979
00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:35.620
<v Speaker 2>have gone up so none of my bees folate</v>
<v Speaker 2>is still borderline but it was deficient</v>

980
00:58:36.661 --> 00:58:39.930
<v Speaker 2>before and all my other bees are have</v>
<v Speaker 2>gone up to normal.</v>

981
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:43.830
<v Speaker 2>What about Vitamin C O vitamin C was</v>
<v Speaker 2>always normal Vitamin C hasn't changed</v>

982
00:58:43.831 --> 00:58:44.280
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

983
00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:48.270
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating because that's one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones I think people are deficient if</v>

984
00:58:48.271 --> 00:58:49.650
<v Speaker 3>you are on this diet.</v>

985
00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Well I did some background reading</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've been I thought people died</v>

986
00:58:55.021 --> 00:58:58.380
<v Speaker 2>of scurvy if they didn't eat vegetables</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like everybody thinks that well.</v>

987
00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:01.950
<v Speaker 2>But it turns out vitamin C and glucose</v>
<v Speaker 2>compete.</v>

988
00:59:03.930 --> 00:59:07.380
<v Speaker 2>So if you don't eat glucose you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't use as much vitamin C..</v>

989
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah and I haven't been supplementing my</v>

990
00:59:11.301 --> 00:59:12.510
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C is totally fine.</v>

991
00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:14.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sean Baker said something about</v>

992
00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:18.260
<v Speaker 5>something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was some of the vitamin C that</v>

993
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:23.500
<v Speaker 5>you're taking in is competing with</v>
<v Speaker 5>glucose and that you need far less of it</v>

994
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:28.310
<v Speaker 5>and it's far more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there is some vitamin C in beef.</v>

995
00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:32.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you telling the grass fed beef or</v>

996
00:59:32.301 --> 00:59:33.020
<v Speaker 3>you do care.</v>

997
00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:35.960
<v Speaker 2>So initially I tried to get rid of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the variables because I didn't know what</v>

998
00:59:35.961 --> 00:59:39.080
<v Speaker 2>I was reacting to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was eating grass fed antibiotic</v>

999
00:59:39.081 --> 00:59:42.350
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff and now I'm eating mostly</v>

1000
00:59:42.351 --> 00:59:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I try to stay away from the antibiotic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hormone meat but I'm eating grain</v>

1001
00:59:45.531 --> 00:59:49.340
<v Speaker 2>finished because it's just so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheaper than grass fed and it doesn't.</v>

1002
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I have no problems with it.</v>

1003
00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:55.070
<v Speaker 1>How would you know whether or not beef</v>
<v Speaker 1>has antibiotics or hormones in it you</v>

1004
00:59:55.071 --> 00:59:57.360
<v Speaker 1>just trust the labeling right.</v>

1005
00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.590
<v Speaker 2>That's it but I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've gone out to eat in restaurants</v>

1006
01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:04.220
<v Speaker 2>where I'm sure the meats lower quality</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't had an autoimmune flare up</v>

1007
01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:05.054
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>

1008
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:08.750
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you go out to eat you know one</v>

1009
01:00:08.751 --> 01:00:12.170
<v Speaker 3>of things you posted the other day was</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you had steak that had pepper on</v>

1010
01:00:12.171 --> 01:00:12.470
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1011
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I had pepper on Monday pepper like</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground pepper and you're freaking out.</v>

1012
01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:19.550
<v Speaker 2>I was freaking out on Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah that was like I don't know what</v>

1013
01:00:19.551 --> 01:00:21.930
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's OK.</v>

1014
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah I was freaking out I was</v>

1015
01:00:24.981 --> 01:00:28.670
<v Speaker 2>stressed out for the whole day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like if it flared first of all</v>

1016
01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:31.940
<v Speaker 2>these flare ups don't happen instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it gives you enough time to freak out</v>

1017
01:00:31.941 --> 01:00:33.950
<v Speaker 2>about if they're going to happen for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of days.</v>

1018
01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like a month of an</v>

1019
01:00:36.321 --> 01:00:41.321
<v Speaker 2>autoimmune disorder and depression and</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain fog and not being able to think is</v>

1020
01:00:41.331 --> 01:00:43.850
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah I am freaked out but I'm OK.</v>

1021
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:48.140
<v Speaker 2>The one thing I found really helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing I found that helps these</v>

1022
01:00:48.141 --> 01:00:49.910
<v Speaker 2>reactions is an infrared sauna.</v>

1023
01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:54.410
<v Speaker 3>If I get in there like once a day and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweat only an infrared one what about a</v>

1024
01:00:54.411 --> 01:00:56.900
<v Speaker 3>regular one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know.</v>

1025
01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.790
<v Speaker 3>Honestly no I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>

1026
01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:02.930
<v Speaker 3>So the idea just elevated heat</v>
<v Speaker 3>temperature whether it's infrared or</v>

1027
01:01:02.931 --> 01:01:03.764
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1028
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:06.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I don't know if it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just read all the benefits of</v>

1029
01:01:06.141 --> 01:01:09.080
<v Speaker 2>infrared but I haven't any fits over a</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular sauna.</v>

1030
01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like longevity studies from</v>

1031
01:01:12.741 --> 01:01:13.550
<v Speaker 2>Finland.</v>

1032
01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:15.980
<v Speaker 3>Those are done in the regular sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a regular sauna.</v>

1033
01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:18.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ones that are done that show the</v>

1034
01:01:18.411 --> 01:01:22.280
<v Speaker 3>decrease of mortality of 40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a regular sauna regular sauna.</v>

1035
01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But mitochondrial helps you go that.</v>

1036
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:31.190
<v Speaker 3>Please there's a study maybe Rhonda</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patrick has it up on our Web site but</v>

1037
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:35.150
<v Speaker 3>because I asked her whether I should get</v>
<v Speaker 3>a regular sauna or a infrared and she</v>

1038
01:01:35.151 --> 01:01:37.400
<v Speaker 3>said the studies that were done were</v>
<v Speaker 3>done with a regular sauna.</v>

1039
01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:41.900
<v Speaker 3>And she said the real issue is that your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body is producing heat shock proteins.</v>

1040
01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.960
<v Speaker 3>So whether it's infrared or regular the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole.</v>

1041
01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:48.260
<v Speaker 3>The real issue is your body's in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme 170 degree temperature produces</v>

1042
01:01:48.261 --> 01:01:53.261
<v Speaker 3>these cytokines and these cytokines</v>
<v Speaker 3>cytokines taglines and your body is</v>

1043
01:01:54.201 --> 01:01:58.120
<v Speaker 3>reacting to this incredible temperature</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is what produces anti</v>

1044
01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:00.980
<v Speaker 3>inflammation effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think for someone like you with</v>

1045
01:02:00.981 --> 01:02:05.450
<v Speaker 3>arthritis in particular anything that</v>
<v Speaker 3>reduces inflammation would be a great</v>

1046
01:02:05.451 --> 01:02:05.960
<v Speaker 3>benefit.</v>

1047
01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.430
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No it's sorry.</v>

1048
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just if I'm reacting like Sonia makes</v>

1049
01:02:09.861 --> 01:02:13.220
<v Speaker 2>me feel like 20 percent better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot better.</v>

1050
01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Laughter I get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1051
01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:19.540
<v Speaker 2>If I'm not reacting I don't sweat as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much when I get in and it's nice but</v>

1052
01:02:19.821 --> 01:02:22.460
<v Speaker 2>it's not like a huge relief like it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm reacting.</v>

1053
01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:25.070
<v Speaker 3>It's giant for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't have the autoimmune</v>

1054
01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:29.000
<v Speaker 3>issues that you have but boy for me it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just it's a game changer.</v>

1055
01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get in there for 20 minutes half hour</v>

1056
01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:33.440
<v Speaker 3>and I get out there it's just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything just feels better.</v>

1057
01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:34.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah yeah.</v>

1058
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:38.510
<v Speaker 6>And it hits me like about 20 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 6>after I get out and I get this mood up</v>

1059
01:02:38.511 --> 01:02:41.390
<v Speaker 6>and it's just like once your body I</v>
<v Speaker 6>think that what that is is your</v>

1060
01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:45.950
<v Speaker 6>temperature normalizes your body</v>
<v Speaker 6>temperature normalizes after you're out</v>

1061
01:02:45.951 --> 01:02:48.770
<v Speaker 6>of that heat and then everything's just</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Oh yeah.</v>

1062
01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:50.570
<v Speaker 7>No it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's great.</v>

1063
01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.520
<v Speaker 7>Have you done the crime therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1064
01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:53.600
<v Speaker 7>Similar feeling right.</v>

1065
01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:56.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not as good I don't think.</v>

1066
01:02:56.070 --> 01:03:00.500
<v Speaker 2>No but similar feeling it's better</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually for pain so I have my ankle</v>

1067
01:03:00.501 --> 01:03:05.120
<v Speaker 2>replacement still gives me problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's an ankle replacement so</v>

1068
01:03:05.121 --> 01:03:09.380
<v Speaker 2>I've done trial therapy for that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's works better for pain I think</v>

1069
01:03:09.381 --> 01:03:10.280
<v Speaker 2>than the sauna does.</v>

1070
01:03:10.310 --> 01:03:12.470
<v Speaker 5>Now what do they do when they replace</v>
<v Speaker 5>your ankle.</v>

1071
01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:16.910
<v Speaker 5>Do they cut off the bottom of the joint</v>
<v Speaker 5>and recap it and put something else</v>

1072
01:03:16.911 --> 01:03:17.270
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1073
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:22.270
<v Speaker 2>So they cut off yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cut off the bottom of the tibia</v>

1074
01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:27.290
<v Speaker 2>it's a big bone tibia and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>replace the top of the Tallis.</v>

1075
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:33.670
<v Speaker 2>It sucks and I got it done in 2009 when</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ankle joints weren't as good as they</v>

1076
01:03:35.751 --> 01:03:38.840
<v Speaker 2>are now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm left with this like old ankle</v>

1077
01:03:38.841 --> 01:03:43.841
<v Speaker 2>joint and I'm 26 so I have to get it</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at because it's giving me</v>

1078
01:03:44.691 --> 01:03:45.524
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

1079
01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.260
<v Speaker 7>You going to get another one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh God no I hope not.</v>

1080
01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:51.400
<v Speaker 7>I think they're just gonna try and fix I</v>
<v Speaker 7>had it some super dope carbon fiber a</v>

1081
01:03:51.401 --> 01:03:54.200
<v Speaker 7>new model.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know they don't have that.</v>

1082
01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:57.460
<v Speaker 7>Nobody's like making anything cool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No no.</v>

1083
01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:02.240
<v Speaker 7>It seems like they're constantly</v>
<v Speaker 7>improving that I mean it looks like on</v>

1084
01:04:02.241 --> 01:04:05.210
<v Speaker 7>YouTube but that's not really what it</v>
<v Speaker 7>looks like in real life.</v>

1085
01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.160
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now it's like maybe I could just get a</v>

1086
01:04:07.161 --> 01:04:10.790
<v Speaker 7>new foot I could get a better foot right</v>
<v Speaker 7>on a new foot to a new foot.</v>

1087
01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:15.680
<v Speaker 7>Well some robot foot maybe salon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like what the fuck is this.</v>

1088
01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:18.870
<v Speaker 11>Depends on the robot foot.</v>

1089
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:22.580
<v Speaker 5>You'd be down for a robot foot if it</v>
<v Speaker 5>like took away all your pain.</v>

1090
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:23.503
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1091
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:26.000
<v Speaker 2>If I could run again I can't run with an</v>
<v Speaker 2>ankle replacement.</v>

1092
01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:28.290
<v Speaker 3>What about you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hip replacement can I have replacements</v>

1093
01:04:28.310 --> 01:04:30.800
<v Speaker 3>resign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah but they I have friends that got a</v>

1094
01:04:30.801 --> 01:04:32.900
<v Speaker 3>hip replacement they said of running out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the question.</v>

1095
01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:35.570
<v Speaker 3>So I love the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you said no way.</v>

1096
01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.433
<v Speaker 3>You can't run.</v>

1097
01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:39.800
<v Speaker 2>I could run on the hip replacement</v>
<v Speaker 2>really and I can limp along with my</v>

1098
01:04:39.801 --> 01:04:42.980
<v Speaker 2>ankle but the hip replacement gives me</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problems.</v>

1099
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:47.720
<v Speaker 5>It's great but I thought that the load</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is placed on the hip is not.</v>

1100
01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:52.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they recommend activities</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that all the time all the time.</v>

1101
01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:57.270
<v Speaker 2>But even like a watch an elliptical</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty low impact.</v>

1102
01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:01.250
<v Speaker 2>And I can't do that because of my ankle</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my hip is fine.</v>

1103
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:04.310
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever tried to verse a climber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1104
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:09.670
<v Speaker 3>We have to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when angled like a beam like with</v>

1105
01:05:10.461 --> 01:05:15.461
<v Speaker 3>handles on it and you do this</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal cardio it's amazing.</v>

1106
01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.910
<v Speaker 3>Works your core because you're at an</v>
<v Speaker 3>angle so you got you're kind of planking</v>

1107
01:05:19.911 --> 01:05:21.350
<v Speaker 3>almost a little bit while you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1108
01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1109
01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:24.410
<v Speaker 3>My or sadder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1110
01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:28.380
<v Speaker 3>Do you do sprints with it and then do</v>
<v Speaker 3>two bodies like 2010s.</v>

1111
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:32.750
<v Speaker 3>Wow 20 seconds on 10 second break 20</v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds on ten second break.</v>

1112
01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.790
<v Speaker 3>Phenomenal huh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1113
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:38.340
<v Speaker 3>One of the best exercises in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>cardio huh.</v>

1114
01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.940
<v Speaker 2>I stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So did you do a bike.</v>

1115
01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:44.690
<v Speaker 2>No I can't really do anything with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>ankle but I did start it.</v>

1116
01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah it's a huge pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna need to get surgery I think</v>

1117
01:05:47.751 --> 01:05:50.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting something done in January.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what are they gonna do.</v>

1118
01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:56.140
<v Speaker 2>So basically bone has grown into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>joint so it's basically fused.</v>

1119
01:05:58.310 --> 01:06:02.480
<v Speaker 2>So I just don't have any movement and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of hurts and it doesn't hurt like</v>

1120
01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:07.380
<v Speaker 2>it hurt when I needed it replaced but it</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurts so they're going to go in and</v>

1121
01:06:07.381 --> 01:06:09.810
<v Speaker 2>clean out all the bone and pray that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that works.</v>

1122
01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's that's what my January is</v>

1123
01:06:14.221 --> 01:06:14.760
<v Speaker 2>gonna be.</v>

1124
01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.600
<v Speaker 5>Does this make you think that like if</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got on this die.</v>

1125
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:19.410
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When you were younger you could have</v>

1126
01:06:19.411 --> 01:06:22.560
<v Speaker 7>ordered all the shots is why I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 7>very pleased with the medical community.</v>

1127
01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.910
<v Speaker 7>What the hell do they know me.</v>

1128
01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.560
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know back but they could</v>
<v Speaker 2>have said I don't know.</v>

1129
01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:29.910
<v Speaker 2>They could've look to the celiac thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would have at least been clued in</v>

1130
01:06:29.911 --> 01:06:32.850
<v Speaker 2>that gluten was a problem and maybe just</v>
<v Speaker 2>removing that would've been good enough.</v>

1131
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Well it seems that the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>research that they would have to do.</v>

1132
01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:40.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean think about how many different</v>
<v Speaker 3>things you have to look out to come to</v>

1133
01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.840
<v Speaker 3>that illusion the time you had to spend</v>
<v Speaker 3>like three years.</v>

1134
01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Canada has public.</v>

1135
01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have public health care</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1136
01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:52.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's it's it's weird right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not as motivated.</v>

1137
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:57.790
<v Speaker 2>They're not it's not ideal for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>with very special problems.</v>

1138
01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1139
01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:02.670
<v Speaker 3>Good for general public and it's great</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have money and you need to</v>

1140
01:07:02.671 --> 01:07:05.970
<v Speaker 3>get taken care of but they have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people coming in and out.</v>

1141
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:06.990
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's constant.</v>

1142
01:07:07.050 --> 01:07:09.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting this surgery done in North</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carolina.</v>

1143
01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fuckin turn your back on Canada</v>

1144
01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:13.873
<v Speaker 1>huh.</v>

1145
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:18.480
<v Speaker 2>I could wait around for like three and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>half years for a surgeon that's not as</v>

1146
01:07:18.481 --> 01:07:18.910
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

1147
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:20.640
<v Speaker 15>Yeah yeah.</v>

1148
01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:24.760
<v Speaker 10>That this infrared thing I'm finding</v>
<v Speaker 10>very interesting stuff.</v>

1149
01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:29.840
<v Speaker 10>I remember reading what you said but I'm</v>
<v Speaker 10>not finding that and I've only found</v>

1150
01:07:29.881 --> 01:07:33.300
<v Speaker 10>stuff that I can't find.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Ben Greenfield I think it was a</v>

1151
01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:35.270
<v Speaker 10>transcription of a podcast today with</v>
<v Speaker 10>Rhonda.</v>

1152
01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.410
<v Speaker 10>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And something else very similar which is</v>

1153
01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.690
<v Speaker 10>information from Dr. Jill Kahn.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Mm hmm.</v>

1154
01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:45.120
<v Speaker 10>That says only sunlight sunlight and far</v>
<v Speaker 10>infrared sonnets have been shown to</v>

1155
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:49.920
<v Speaker 10>increase core temperature for effective</v>
<v Speaker 10>detoxification because they get you can</v>

1156
01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:55.050
<v Speaker 10>stay longer in the threshold area they</v>
<v Speaker 10>want to around one hundred and thirty</v>

1157
01:07:55.051 --> 01:07:57.930
<v Speaker 10>degrees you can be there up to forty</v>
<v Speaker 10>five minutes or so.</v>

1158
01:07:58.290 --> 01:08:00.660
<v Speaker 10>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And you I guess you can't unless you can</v>

1159
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:04.800
<v Speaker 10>withstand it in a trailer heat one</v>
<v Speaker 10>because it's heating the air around you</v>

1160
01:08:04.801 --> 01:08:06.510
<v Speaker 10>not light heating your body.</v>

1161
01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:08.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1162
01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:13.550
<v Speaker 3>So the infrared one is heating your body</v>
<v Speaker 3>in specific rather than you being in the</v>

1163
01:08:14.341 --> 01:08:15.270
<v Speaker 3>heat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

1164
01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:19.620
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can do it longer and that's where</v>

1165
01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:21.310
<v Speaker 3>the benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What how much longer.</v>

1166
01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:23.850
<v Speaker 3>How long you supposed to it said at</v>
<v Speaker 3>least 30 minutes.</v>

1167
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:26.340
<v Speaker 3>But that's what I do anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the difference.</v>

1168
01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:28.290
<v Speaker 3>So infrared song is good if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy.</v>

1169
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:31.500
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I didn't want to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But hey maybe that's what they're saying</v>

1170
01:08:31.501 --> 01:08:35.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it seems like you get more benefit</v>

1171
01:08:35.670 --> 01:08:39.880
<v Speaker 3>with less suffering that's what it would</v>
<v Speaker 3>seem like because you could do it</v>

1172
01:08:39.881 --> 01:08:40.450
<v Speaker 3>longer.</v>

1173
01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:43.180
<v Speaker 10>I think that's what they're getting at</v>
<v Speaker 10>but I don't know if that's the reason</v>

1174
01:08:43.181 --> 01:08:46.150
<v Speaker 10>why I got enough people off to just quit</v>
<v Speaker 10>after 20 minutes and I can't get to the</v>

1175
01:08:46.151 --> 01:08:46.630
<v Speaker 10>30.</v>

1176
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:49.840
<v Speaker 5>Well people do man they get does get</v>
<v Speaker 5>uncomfortable with it but if you could</v>

1177
01:08:49.841 --> 01:08:53.140
<v Speaker 5>have if you get the same benefits you</v>
<v Speaker 5>could avoid the discomfort why wouldn't</v>

1178
01:08:53.141 --> 01:08:53.974
<v Speaker 5>you do that right.</v>

1179
01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also just it's just uncomfortable</v>

1180
01:08:56.111 --> 01:08:58.810
<v Speaker 2>right before you start sweating when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like oh I'm really hot and then</v>

1181
01:08:58.811 --> 01:09:00.430
<v Speaker 2>you start sweating and you're it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>as bad.</v>

1182
01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:05.320
<v Speaker 6>There's a new company that's making an</v>
<v Speaker 6>infrared sauna that you work out in.</v>

1183
01:09:05.650 --> 01:09:10.650
<v Speaker 6>It's got a chin up bar in and it's got</v>
<v Speaker 6>all these like like resistance cables.</v>

1184
01:09:11.890 --> 01:09:15.280
<v Speaker 10>The other part of this too which is I'd</v>
<v Speaker 10>have to go more into science is that I</v>

1185
01:09:15.281 --> 01:09:19.060
<v Speaker 10>don't know is that the LCD is like the</v>
<v Speaker 10>infrared light can penetrate your skin</v>

1186
01:09:19.061 --> 01:09:22.270
<v Speaker 10>whereas the heat maybe can't because</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's just heat.</v>

1187
01:09:22.330 --> 01:09:26.860
<v Speaker 10>It's heating up your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's not like infrared is literally a</v>

1188
01:09:26.861 --> 01:09:27.970
<v Speaker 10>wave.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's a lightweight.</v>

1189
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a different kind of it invigorates</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mitochondria so many works and that</v>

1190
01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:32.290
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>

1191
01:09:32.290 --> 01:09:36.250
<v Speaker 5>The studies that they did in was in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Norway Finland Finland.</v>

1192
01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.650
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they just didn't have infrared</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1193
01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:43.180
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I maybe I don't know because like</v>
<v Speaker 5>those Russian Banias they do the regular</v>

1194
01:09:43.181 --> 01:09:47.080
<v Speaker 5>saw on us these regular saw on us and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they go hot cold hot cold and they've</v>

1195
01:09:47.081 --> 01:09:50.340
<v Speaker 5>had some pretty awesome benefits of</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1196
01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:53.500
<v Speaker 10>And so there might be something to that</v>
<v Speaker 10>because they're using light like</v>

1197
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:55.840
<v Speaker 10>dentists using light now to harden</v>
<v Speaker 10>fillings.</v>

1198
01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:59.520
<v Speaker 3>So that's pretty new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah science.</v>

1199
01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:03.490
<v Speaker 3>She Blinded Me With Science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating stuff.</v>

1200
01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:08.050
<v Speaker 3>It is all very fascinating stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so sauna definitely helps you either</v>

1201
01:10:08.051 --> 01:10:08.480
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1202
01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think like I've read some studies</v>

1203
01:10:11.321 --> 01:10:15.130
<v Speaker 2>on it working out a mitochondrial level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about it.</v>

1204
01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm just there's something to it and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>after about half an hour is the only</v>

1205
01:10:19.241 --> 01:10:23.380
<v Speaker 2>thing that's helped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried like I tried everything to</v>

1206
01:10:23.381 --> 01:10:28.030
<v Speaker 2>get rid of these reactions faster like</v>
<v Speaker 2>detoxification things or mostly just</v>

1207
01:10:28.031 --> 01:10:31.330
<v Speaker 2>different weird different sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>detoxification things and nothing's</v>

1208
01:10:31.331 --> 01:10:35.500
<v Speaker 2>helped except the sauna they still last</v>
<v Speaker 2>for as long with they're not as awful.</v>

1209
01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:40.910
<v Speaker 15>So I was telling you that this guy Kevin</v>
<v Speaker 15>Bass who's P.H.</v>

1210
01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:45.980
<v Speaker 15>Dean a scientist and he contacted me and</v>
<v Speaker 15>I contacted him put on my glasses I can</v>

1211
01:10:48.401 --> 01:10:52.840
<v Speaker 15>see you better.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And he we went back and forth about this</v>

1212
01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:57.960
<v Speaker 15>online and so he sent me a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 15>stuff what he thinks.</v>

1213
01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:04.620
<v Speaker 15>And one of them is nutrient deficiency</v>
<v Speaker 15>and that</v>

1214
01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:12.340
<v Speaker 15>immuno suppression from a nutrient</v>
<v Speaker 15>deficiency and that in the ideas that</v>

1215
01:11:14.230 --> 01:11:19.230
<v Speaker 15>maybe in having less nutrients and</v>
<v Speaker 15>having less that you're a dietary immuno</v>

1216
01:11:22.931 --> 01:11:27.931
<v Speaker 15>suppression V A deficiency might be</v>
<v Speaker 15>helping you.</v>

1217
01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:33.050
<v Speaker 15>Oh and he said basically crazier things</v>
<v Speaker 15>have happened and that you reported</v>

1218
01:11:33.051 --> 01:11:36.050
<v Speaker 15>still having symptoms when you get sick</v>
<v Speaker 15>even on a carnivore diet.</v>

1219
01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:40.400
<v Speaker 15>And he said this shows that the</v>
<v Speaker 15>carnivore diet is a symptomatic</v>

1220
01:11:40.401 --> 01:11:42.020
<v Speaker 15>treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 15>It's not because she's removed the</v>

1221
01:11:42.021 --> 01:11:47.021
<v Speaker 15>offending antigen but yeah so I don't</v>
<v Speaker 15>even know if I understood all that</v>

1222
01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:51.250
<v Speaker 15>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Well this is a very long.</v>

1223
01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:55.780
<v Speaker 15>He wrote a very very long piece on this</v>
<v Speaker 15>and I appreciate that he took the time</v>

1224
01:11:55.781 --> 01:11:58.870
<v Speaker 15>to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 15>One of the things that is saying is like</v>

1225
01:11:59.350 --> 01:12:04.350
<v Speaker 15>Vitamin A and that this this that this</v>
<v Speaker 15>diet could be vitamin A deficient</v>

1226
01:12:05.431 --> 01:12:09.780
<v Speaker 15>Vitamin C deficient we went over the</v>
<v Speaker 15>thing is I have an E deficient vitamin K</v>

1227
01:12:09.781 --> 01:12:14.781
<v Speaker 15>deficient.</v>
<v Speaker 15>So you got your results back so you got</v>

1228
01:12:15.421 --> 01:12:17.330
<v Speaker 15>tested in my vitamin K.</v>

1229
01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Everything's good is normal vitamin A's</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal normal like above it says</v>

1230
01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:28.010
<v Speaker 2>anything above 30 is okay for vitamin K</v>
<v Speaker 2>to minus 40 everything about 70 is okay</v>

1231
01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:31.800
<v Speaker 2>for vitamin A mind seventy nine mm hmm.</v>

1232
01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:35.760
<v Speaker 6>He said also that a lot of your symptoms</v>
<v Speaker 6>including joint destruction fatigue</v>

1233
01:12:35.761 --> 01:12:39.510
<v Speaker 6>depression etc. can be caused by the</v>
<v Speaker 6>drugs that are used to treat rheumatoid</v>

1234
01:12:39.511 --> 01:12:42.360
<v Speaker 6>arthritis although our rheumatoid</v>
<v Speaker 6>arthritis came first though.</v>

1235
01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:43.620
<v Speaker 5>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1236
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:47.040
<v Speaker 5>But then the joint destruction was that.</v>

1237
01:12:47.170 --> 01:12:50.470
<v Speaker 7>How do you test was that post that you</v>
<v Speaker 7>being on those medications were those</v>

1238
01:12:50.471 --> 01:12:52.410
<v Speaker 7>studies even done.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How do you test that.</v>

1239
01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:54.820
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's the drugs or the arthritis</v>
<v Speaker 7>causing it.</v>

1240
01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:57.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is his take on this is the</v>

1241
01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:00.820
<v Speaker 3>potential scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean without rejecting it totally.</v>

1242
01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:06.330
<v Speaker 3>You were on those drugs far far earlier</v>
<v Speaker 3>than your joints destroyed right.</v>

1243
01:13:06.910 --> 01:13:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I started the drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grade 4 and then grade eleven.</v>

1244
01:13:11.650 --> 01:13:13.480
<v Speaker 3>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were the replacements.</v>

1245
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look this is this whole thing is a very</v>

1246
01:13:19.031 --> 01:13:24.031
<v Speaker 3>fascinating subject because people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>not having the response that</v>

1247
01:13:24.581 --> 01:13:28.810
<v Speaker 3>nutritionists would like them to have no</v>
<v Speaker 3>right nutritionist would like you guys</v>

1248
01:13:28.811 --> 01:13:32.260
<v Speaker 3>to be freaking out falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it seems to be doing well.</v>

1249
01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:35.440
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend of mine lives in San</v>
<v Speaker 3>Diego who's been on the carnivore diet</v>

1250
01:13:35.441 --> 01:13:37.120
<v Speaker 3>for a while and you know he's a Navy</v>
<v Speaker 3>SEAL.</v>

1251
01:13:37.150 --> 01:13:41.200
<v Speaker 3>He said he feels fucking fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said you know he said You just tried</v>

1252
01:13:41.201 --> 01:13:43.540
<v Speaker 3>it out see what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's never felt better in his whole</v>

1253
01:13:43.541 --> 01:13:47.650
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah elimination diets.</v>

1254
01:13:47.770 --> 01:13:52.770
<v Speaker 6>This is this is a big thing like getting</v>
<v Speaker 6>getting yourself down to a very small</v>

1255
01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.640
<v Speaker 6>number of foods</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know and that this seems to have</v>

1256
01:13:57.641 --> 01:14:00.160
<v Speaker 6>some sort of a a large benefit for</v>
<v Speaker 6>people as well.</v>

1257
01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah I mean I think it would depend on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the foods you know it's like your body</v>

1258
01:14:05.170 --> 01:14:07.600
<v Speaker 3>not having too much to manage.</v>

1259
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:12.870
<v Speaker 5>And people with</v>
<v Speaker 5>autoimmune disorders and diseases.</v>

1260
01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:18.320
<v Speaker 5>Having less to manage could potentially</v>
<v Speaker 5>be what.</v>

1261
01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:19.660
<v Speaker 5>What is benefiting you as well.</v>

1262
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:22.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't play as last though because if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you survived only off of soy you're not</v>

1263
01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:25.330
<v Speaker 2>going to do well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it depends what you're eating.</v>

1264
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:29.380
<v Speaker 6>One of the things that he's saying too</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that when you get sick the systemic</v>

1265
01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:33.550
<v Speaker 6>inflammation probably opens up your</v>
<v Speaker 6>intestinal barrier which causes auto</v>

1266
01:14:33.551 --> 01:14:37.690
<v Speaker 6>immune systems to kick in again and said</v>
<v Speaker 6>the same thing happens with any food</v>

1267
01:14:37.691 --> 01:14:39.850
<v Speaker 6>that causes your intestinal barrier to</v>
<v Speaker 6>open up.</v>

1268
01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:45.400
<v Speaker 3>He said Why is this happening I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand and that you and your father</v>

1269
01:14:45.401 --> 01:14:47.980
<v Speaker 3>both think this could be some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>hereditary thing.</v>

1270
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:50.400
<v Speaker 3>Have you guys done any twenty three and</v>
<v Speaker 3>me test.</v>

1271
01:14:50.890 --> 01:14:51.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is that.</v>

1272
01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:56.470
<v Speaker 3>I have an genotype for a different gene</v>
<v Speaker 3>disorders perhaps.</v>

1273
01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing showed up.</v>

1274
01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.720
<v Speaker 2>I ran it I ran it through Rhonda Patrick</v>
<v Speaker 2>has something on her Web site right.</v>

1275
01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.580
<v Speaker 2>I ran it through that I ran it through</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prometheus.</v>

1276
01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Nothing shocking shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a celiac Gene.</v>

1277
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Dad doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's not exactly the issue.</v>

1278
01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:15.000
<v Speaker 8>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

1279
01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:22.080
<v Speaker 6>The whole thing is just it's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>more interesting things is how people</v>

1280
01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.840
<v Speaker 6>they always want to attach all these</v>
<v Speaker 6>other things to it that environmental</v>

1281
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:33.510
<v Speaker 6>concerns and the concern for you know</v>
<v Speaker 6>the the health and welfare of these</v>

1282
01:15:33.671 --> 01:15:38.671
<v Speaker 6>animals and that you're supporting</v>
<v Speaker 6>factory farming and always that it gets</v>

1283
01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:42.250
<v Speaker 6>very it gets very ideological.</v>

1284
01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:44.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes super fast real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1285
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:48.940
<v Speaker 2>But does not we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No I also I don't like I'm concerned</v>

1286
01:15:48.941 --> 01:15:51.670
<v Speaker 2>about other people who are suffering as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much as I was suffering.</v>

1287
01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah that's it.</v>

1288
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:58.090
<v Speaker 3>Right before you're concerned with</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals like everything a way before</v>

1289
01:15:58.130 --> 01:15:59.290
<v Speaker 3>like try living.</v>

1290
01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:03.970
<v Speaker 2>If your choice is to live with an</v>
<v Speaker 2>autoimmune disorder and like die slowly</v>

1291
01:16:03.971 --> 01:16:08.150
<v Speaker 2>that way you can do that and not eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat if you want to.</v>

1292
01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:11.780
<v Speaker 5>Well this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also I think a disingenuous</v>

1293
01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:16.610
<v Speaker 5>argument because 97 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>people in the world eat meat or</v>

1294
01:16:16.611 --> 01:16:17.380
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

1295
01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:20.270
<v Speaker 2>So it's easy to tell other people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're not experiencing those</v>

1296
01:16:20.271 --> 01:16:22.160
<v Speaker 2>symptoms it's also.</v>

1297
01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:23.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

1298
01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:28.210
<v Speaker 1>definitely it's definitely easier if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not experiencing those symptoms</v>

1299
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:30.850
<v Speaker 1>but there's so much meat eating going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

1300
01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:36.440
<v Speaker 1>And if you if if people really can</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit greatly from just an all meat</v>

1301
01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.840
<v Speaker 1>diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to tell them Don't do that.</v>

1302
01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Go vegan and keep us pagan and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>covered in hives and itching and and</v>

1303
01:16:48.421 --> 01:16:50.980
<v Speaker 1>being depressed states the rest of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1304
01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.173
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1305
01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:58.040
<v Speaker 3>It's just it's such a hot subject and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like this is something that we're</v>

1306
01:16:59.311 --> 01:17:01.530
<v Speaker 3>gonna have more insight on over the next</v>
<v Speaker 3>few years.</v>

1307
01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're starting to study it now and it's</v>

1308
01:17:03.241 --> 01:17:07.560
<v Speaker 3>starting to be mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know Shawn Baker who's you know he's</v>

1309
01:17:07.561 --> 01:17:12.360
<v Speaker 3>a physician and then you've got some</v>
<v Speaker 3>really dedicated athletes that are</v>

1310
01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:14.040
<v Speaker 3>trying it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know Zach bitter.</v>

1311
01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.150
<v Speaker 3>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who heal what does he owe on the North</v>

1312
01:17:18.151 --> 01:17:20.850
<v Speaker 3>American record for 24 hour race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1313
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:26.270
<v Speaker 3>Or if not for 24 hours for 100 miles he</v>
<v Speaker 3>ran 100 miles in 11 hours and 40 minutes</v>

1314
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:31.720
<v Speaker 3>which is how fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he eats almost nothing but meat.</v>

1315
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:33.390
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost his entire died.</v>

1316
01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:38.420
<v Speaker 3>He supplements with high levels of</v>
<v Speaker 3>glucose like those gels and shit like</v>

1317
01:17:39.181 --> 01:17:41.310
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Ramsey's carbs way up when he's</v>

1318
01:17:41.311 --> 01:17:43.410
<v Speaker 3>going to do 100 mile races and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1319
01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:47.400
<v Speaker 3>But that's that's honestly a ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 3>requirement on his body.</v>

1320
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:50.850
<v Speaker 3>He's Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's asking his body to run 100 fucking</v>

1321
01:17:50.851 --> 01:17:54.550
<v Speaker 3>miles and 11 hours and 40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1322
01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:56.970
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah that's crazy.</v>

1323
01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.260
<v Speaker 3>He also weighs five pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1324
01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.660
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He weighs like a hundred forty but it's</v>

1325
01:18:03.661 --> 01:18:08.661
<v Speaker 3>just you know his his his diet shows</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it is possible to do extreme</v>

1326
01:18:10.321 --> 01:18:12.270
<v Speaker 3>physical feats while while you're on</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1327
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:15.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah he does a podcasts also with Shawn</v>
<v Speaker 3>Baker.</v>

1328
01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:21.680
<v Speaker 3>So this is something that people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>really starting to study now and there's</v>

1329
01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:26.580
<v Speaker 3>a lot of argument there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>hesitancy not anger.</v>

1330
01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:30.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh I've read some article today</v>
<v Speaker 3>criticizing you and your dad and now.</v>

1331
01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>

1332
01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:36.480
<v Speaker 2>I find it kind of like I can understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people who go on that kind of</v>

1333
01:18:36.481 --> 01:18:39.920
<v Speaker 2>raw diet get really like vegan Haiti.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what I was doing.</v>

1334
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.610
<v Speaker 3>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's true.</v>

1335
01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:44.280
<v Speaker 3>But what they were doing is they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going off about the environment.</v>

1336
01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:46.930
<v Speaker 3>This was like like methane gas produced</v>
<v Speaker 3>by cows.</v>

1337
01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:50.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I saw this article.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just it's not it's not a good</v>

1338
01:18:50.851 --> 01:18:54.400
<v Speaker 3>argument because this is this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening like if you're a person.</v>

1339
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:59.510
<v Speaker 3>OK I'm not saying that you we don't all</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a responsibility to do our part to</v>

1340
01:18:59.761 --> 01:19:00.720
<v Speaker 3>try to save the environment.</v>

1341
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:03.840
<v Speaker 6>But if you're a person who is deathly</v>
<v Speaker 6>ill you go to the supermarket there's a</v>

1342
01:19:03.841 --> 01:19:06.840
<v Speaker 6>lot of fucking beef you can go buy beef.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's right there.</v>

1343
01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:08.670
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you could buy that beef and it fixes</v>

1344
01:19:08.671 --> 01:19:12.840
<v Speaker 6>you what.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why don't you stop and think about the</v>

1345
01:19:12.930 --> 01:19:17.040
<v Speaker 6>ecological concerns the environmental</v>
<v Speaker 6>concerns and then the physical concerns</v>

1346
01:19:17.041 --> 01:19:21.750
<v Speaker 6>of people that are forced to take on</v>
<v Speaker 6>these fucking ridiculous pharmaceutical</v>

1347
01:19:21.751 --> 01:19:24.720
<v Speaker 6>medications.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God times years into their lives</v>

1348
01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:28.950
<v Speaker 6>and think about you're also empowering</v>
<v Speaker 6>these pharmaceutical companies and</v>

1349
01:19:28.951 --> 01:19:33.600
<v Speaker 6>they're lobbying to stop natural natural</v>
<v Speaker 6>cures.</v>

1350
01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:35.870
<v Speaker 6>They're they're trying to make kratom</v>
<v Speaker 6>illegal.</v>

1351
01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:39.900
<v Speaker 6>There's there's a lot of thuggery that's</v>
<v Speaker 6>involved in pharmaceutical companies</v>

1352
01:19:39.901 --> 01:19:44.160
<v Speaker 6>that we're well aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of cherry picking studies.</v>

1353
01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:47.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah they'll do 100 hundred studies one</v>
<v Speaker 6>of them shows that there might be some</v>

1354
01:19:47.731 --> 01:19:51.150
<v Speaker 6>benefit to this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ninety nine shows it fucks you up and</v>

1355
01:19:51.151 --> 01:19:53.070
<v Speaker 6>they ignore those and they're allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 6>do this.</v>

1356
01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:57.210
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of weird shit that we</v>
<v Speaker 6>really should take into consideration</v>

1357
01:19:57.211 --> 01:20:00.060
<v Speaker 6>before we support any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 6>pharmaceutical alternative and</v>

1358
01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:03.870
<v Speaker 6>pharmaceutical drugs aren't demons.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of people that benefit</v>

1359
01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:05.280
<v Speaker 6>greatly from pharmaceutical drugs.</v>

1360
01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:07.320
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I would have been able to</v>

1361
01:20:07.321 --> 01:20:10.530
<v Speaker 2>figure this out unless I'd been on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adderall and had the energy to Google</v>

1362
01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:11.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

1363
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:15.090
<v Speaker 5>I mean look there's these benefits it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>not they're not all bad.</v>

1364
01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:18.450
<v Speaker 5>They're not all good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I don't like that argument like hey</v>

1365
01:20:18.451 --> 01:20:22.650
<v Speaker 5>you know if you go on the carnivore diet</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're you're contributing to methane</v>

1366
01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.870
<v Speaker 5>that's fucking up the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>OK.</v>

1367
01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:29.050
<v Speaker 5>Is it better or worse than</v>
<v Speaker 5>pharmaceutical drugs.</v>

1368
01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:31.060
<v Speaker 5>Is it better or worse than what they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>

1369
01:20:31.090 --> 01:20:33.970
<v Speaker 6>Is it better or worse the fact that foot</v>
<v Speaker 6>pharmaceutical drugs are in the water</v>

1370
01:20:33.971 --> 01:20:36.580
<v Speaker 6>supply.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know they've they've done tests on</v>

1371
01:20:36.581 --> 01:20:38.860
<v Speaker 6>reservoirs and found pharmaceutical</v>
<v Speaker 6>drugs in them.</v>

1372
01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:41.050
<v Speaker 6>They've found pharmaceutical drugs in</v>
<v Speaker 6>rivers.</v>

1373
01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:42.100
<v Speaker 6>Fish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1374
01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:43.900
<v Speaker 6>Lakes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shut the fuck up.</v>

1375
01:20:43.930 --> 01:20:45.790
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't don't.</v>

1376
01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:48.730
<v Speaker 6>If you're going to look at this you</v>
<v Speaker 6>better look at it in a if you want to</v>

1377
01:20:48.731 --> 01:20:52.390
<v Speaker 6>make an argument against it you better</v>
<v Speaker 6>be balanced about this because otherwise</v>

1378
01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:57.190
<v Speaker 6>you're showing your ideological bend</v>
<v Speaker 6>like to say that it's about methane and</v>

1379
01:20:57.191 --> 01:21:01.420
<v Speaker 6>about cows and factory farming.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not really no.</v>

1380
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:03.500
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot going on yeah.</v>

1381
01:21:03.670 --> 01:21:08.380
<v Speaker 6>It's this is a there's a long and</v>
<v Speaker 6>nuanced discussion and if you're you're</v>

1382
01:21:08.381 --> 01:21:13.381
<v Speaker 6>painting this this article in one way</v>
<v Speaker 6>and talking only about the negative</v>

1383
01:21:14.951 --> 01:21:18.310
<v Speaker 6>health and negative environmental</v>
<v Speaker 6>concerns that are associated with beef</v>

1384
01:21:18.311 --> 01:21:21.820
<v Speaker 6>production like look that beef</v>
<v Speaker 6>production is going on a matter with you</v>

1385
01:21:21.821 --> 01:21:23.100
<v Speaker 6>like it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1386
01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:26.410
<v Speaker 6>If you think we can curb it back and</v>
<v Speaker 6>slow it down a little bit that would be</v>

1387
01:21:26.411 --> 01:21:29.650
<v Speaker 6>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But we have to look at it accurately you</v>

1388
01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:34.450
<v Speaker 6>know and also I believe they've proven</v>
<v Speaker 6>that methane see.</v>

1389
01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:39.100
<v Speaker 6>Google if this is true that Methane</v>
<v Speaker 6>production from cows and Sony makes</v>

1390
01:21:39.101 --> 01:21:44.050
<v Speaker 6>sense is far less when they're on a</v>
<v Speaker 6>natural diet when their pasture raised</v>

1391
01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:47.620
<v Speaker 6>than it is if they're corn fed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it makes sense because they have all</v>

1392
01:21:47.621 --> 01:21:48.490
<v Speaker 6>sorts of corn.</v>

1393
01:21:48.630 --> 01:21:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1394
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.460
<v Speaker 1>And also it's Ishan idea when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating grain.</v>

1395
01:21:53.710 --> 01:21:58.000
<v Speaker 3>You know that that could easily be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the problem is they're trying to</v>

1396
01:21:58.001 --> 01:22:01.000
<v Speaker 3>fatten these cows up quicker and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>forced them to eat something that's not</v>

1397
01:22:01.001 --> 01:22:04.120
<v Speaker 3>natural for their body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen that King Corn</v>

1398
01:22:04.121 --> 01:22:07.870
<v Speaker 3>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No great documentary but it's a real</v>

1399
01:22:07.871 --> 01:22:09.840
<v Speaker 3>corn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah it's a mindfuck corns and</v>

1400
01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:13.570
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything in your DNA like your whole</v>

1401
01:22:13.571 --> 01:22:14.950
<v Speaker 3>body's like filled with corn.</v>

1402
01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:18.910
<v Speaker 11>That's crazy because there's so much I</v>
<v Speaker 11>want to hear that it's crazy.</v>

1403
01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:20.170
<v Speaker 3>They've done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did.</v>

1404
01:22:20.230 --> 01:22:24.260
<v Speaker 3>These guys did tests on the carbon in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their body and they found corn is in</v>

1405
01:22:24.261 --> 01:22:27.070
<v Speaker 3>their body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah things the carbon in their body</v>

1406
01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:30.930
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was they just eat they go</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the supermarket aisle and they</v>

1407
01:22:30.931 --> 01:22:33.310
<v Speaker 3>find how many things have corn in them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1408
01:22:33.370 --> 01:22:35.410
<v Speaker 3>And that corn is subsidized by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

1409
01:22:36.130 --> 01:22:38.620
<v Speaker 2>So I grant soy and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1410
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:44.310
<v Speaker 1>I did the articles but again this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is also part of the problem.</v>

1411
01:22:45.730 --> 01:22:48.910
<v Speaker 6>These people who are writing these</v>
<v Speaker 6>articles about your diet and about your</v>

1412
01:22:48.911 --> 01:22:51.540
<v Speaker 6>dad and in his heart.</v>

1413
01:22:51.710 --> 01:22:55.180
<v Speaker 2>This is just taking a shot at dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah that's the other problem.</v>

1414
01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly a lot of that.</v>

1415
01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:00.970
<v Speaker 2>But no the articles aren't great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would be nice if someone</v>

1416
01:23:00.971 --> 01:23:05.971
<v Speaker 2>instead of saying maybe she didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>arthritis or maybe she's just placebo</v>

1417
01:23:06.011 --> 01:23:09.820
<v Speaker 2>balling herself into this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe it's deprivation that's making</v>

1418
01:23:09.821 --> 01:23:13.000
<v Speaker 2>her feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be nice if someone actually did</v>

1419
01:23:13.001 --> 01:23:13.834
<v Speaker 2>a study.</v>

1420
01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:17.050
<v Speaker 3>What does it say Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says cows are being fed a new dye</v>

1421
01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:20.860
<v Speaker 3>they reduce the amount of burping and</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut emission methane by 20 percent.</v>

1422
01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:24.340
<v Speaker 3>From 2008 article.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they being fed.</v>

1423
01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:28.720
<v Speaker 3>What's this new diet didn't specifically</v>
<v Speaker 3>say I don't think they're being fed</v>

1424
01:23:28.721 --> 01:23:32.680
<v Speaker 3>other cows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cow what does it say.</v>

1425
01:23:33.210 --> 01:23:36.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Special machines used to cut the straw.</v>

1426
01:23:36.810 --> 01:23:38.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But still huh.</v>

1427
01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:39.453
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1428
01:23:39.670 --> 01:23:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Mixed with Slash edge silage wheat maize</v>
<v Speaker 1>soya or sugar beet which can be mixed</v>

1429
01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:48.110
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1430
01:23:49.050 --> 01:23:54.050
<v Speaker 5>See if you google</v>
<v Speaker 5>methane by cows who are pasture raised</v>

1431
01:23:57.430 --> 01:24:01.390
<v Speaker 5>methane by cows methane produced by cows</v>
<v Speaker 5>were grass fed.</v>

1432
01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:05.860
<v Speaker 2>See if there's land weirdly enough I</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought I read that it was grain fed</v>

1433
01:24:05.861 --> 01:24:09.580
<v Speaker 2>cows that produce less nothing really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which isn't what I would have guessed.</v>

1434
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:14.910
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting grass fed cattle do</v>
<v Speaker 3>more methane what does produce produce</v>

1435
01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:21.951
<v Speaker 3>do more methane on the foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not reading that grass cattle dupe.</v>

1436
01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:28.170
<v Speaker 3>Produce do more methane because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>harder to digest OK obviously to produce</v>

1437
01:24:28.171 --> 01:24:31.260
<v Speaker 3>more methane because it's harder to</v>
<v Speaker 3>digest grass than grain.</v>

1438
01:24:31.290 --> 01:24:36.290
<v Speaker 3>However some argue grass that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>continually grazed by grass fed cattle</v>

1439
01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:39.990
<v Speaker 3>sequesters enough carbon to make up the</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference in methane.</v>

1440
01:24:40.050 --> 01:24:40.920
<v Speaker 3>OK.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

1441
01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:43.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And healthy soil keeps carbon dioxide</v>

1442
01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:46.470
<v Speaker 3>underground in the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>OK.</v>

1443
01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:48.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah there's a big story behind there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1444
01:24:48.570 --> 01:24:52.950
<v Speaker 3>So that's why it's it's better for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>environment if they eat grass which</v>

1445
01:24:52.951 --> 01:24:55.230
<v Speaker 3>totally makes sense because they've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating grass for a million years.</v>

1446
01:24:55.340 --> 01:25:00.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So so here you are here you are on this</v>

1447
01:25:01.081 --> 01:25:05.670
<v Speaker 3>diet now and you've started to what are</v>
<v Speaker 3>you doing consulting people online.</v>

1448
01:25:05.850 --> 01:25:10.850
<v Speaker 3>So I am now yeah I started about a month</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago and how what does that involve</v>

1449
01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:13.860
<v Speaker 3>people Skype me and basically.</v>

1450
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Want to see me and how I'm still alive</v>
<v Speaker 2>only eating beef and then they ask me</v>

1451
01:25:21.081 --> 01:25:25.130
<v Speaker 2>how to cook and things because nobody</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows how to cook meat without anything</v>

1452
01:25:25.131 --> 01:25:27.110
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well how do you cook like how do you</v>

1453
01:25:27.111 --> 01:25:29.150
<v Speaker 2>cook with just beef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what to do.</v>

1454
01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:31.280
<v Speaker 2>They're like what oil do you use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't use oil</v>

1455
01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:36.720
<v Speaker 2>I think most of these people I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to a lot of low I used tallow.</v>

1456
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Used a lot but most of these people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>really sick and really desperate.</v>

1457
01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:49.890
<v Speaker 2>And they haven't had any help from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical system and so far and this is</v>

1458
01:25:49.961 --> 01:25:53.800
<v Speaker 2>completely true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who's gone on to this like beef</v>

1459
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:57.670
<v Speaker 2>and salt and water diet anybody I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen who's been able to stick through</v>

1460
01:25:57.671 --> 01:26:02.620
<v Speaker 2>that transition period where you get off</v>
<v Speaker 2>of carbs and explosive diarrhea not</v>

1461
01:26:02.621 --> 01:26:05.030
<v Speaker 2>everyone gets that Dad didn't get what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>

1462
01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:09.170
<v Speaker 11>Like it seems to be 50/50.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It looks like the sicker you are seven.</v>

1463
01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:11.230
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

1464
01:26:11.230 --> 01:26:15.460
<v Speaker 2>No it seems to be but like seriously 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of people and it seems like the</v>

1465
01:26:15.461 --> 01:26:18.610
<v Speaker 2>sicker you are the more likely you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get that and I don't all of its</v>

1466
01:26:19.150 --> 01:26:23.050
<v Speaker 2>inability to digest that amount of fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>right away or if it's a microbiome</v>

1467
01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.430
<v Speaker 2>switch or something but it seems to hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 percent of people the other 50</v>

1468
01:26:27.431 --> 01:26:30.460
<v Speaker 2>percent just switch over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But everybody gets some sort of carb</v>

1469
01:26:30.461 --> 01:26:34.230
<v Speaker 2>withdrawal especially if you go from</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a standard American diet over then</v>

1470
01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.530
<v Speaker 2>it's insane cravings.</v>

1471
01:26:35.730 --> 01:26:38.920
<v Speaker 5>Oh do you get your ketones checked if</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't like data.</v>

1472
01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.470
<v Speaker 5>I went to paleo effects this year.</v>

1473
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:46.000
<v Speaker 2>And I got my ketones checked and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were ridiculously high.</v>

1474
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:48.510
<v Speaker 2>That was with a breath test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>

1475
01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:52.690
<v Speaker 2>And then I have like urine strep tests</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I know aren't as accurate but I</v>

1476
01:26:52.691 --> 01:26:57.430
<v Speaker 2>haven't gone out of ketosis my diets</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 80 percent calories from fat.</v>

1477
01:26:57.970 --> 01:27:02.330
<v Speaker 2>So it's them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat ribs which are really fatty.</v>

1478
01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:05.620
<v Speaker 2>I eat ribeye sometimes but I find eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more fat.</v>

1479
01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:09.910
<v Speaker 2>So just caloric Lee I'm getting about 80</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent from the fat.</v>

1480
01:27:09.970 --> 01:27:13.690
<v Speaker 5>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See I eat a lot of meat but eating</v>

1481
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:17.020
<v Speaker 5>really lean meat because I'm eating a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of wild game.</v>

1482
01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:19.920
<v Speaker 5>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not getting as much fat thank the</v>

1483
01:27:19.930 --> 01:27:23.260
<v Speaker 5>fats the good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But definitely it has a factor.</v>

1484
01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just finished I didn't finish.</v>

1485
01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:29.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm halfway through a book called Fat of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the land by I'm going to butcher this</v>

1486
01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:33.730
<v Speaker 2>but like ville how your Steffensen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was this dude who went to live with</v>

1487
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:36.870
<v Speaker 2>you at people in Canada for five years</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eight eight like they eight.</v>

1488
01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.620
<v Speaker 2>And it's amazing like historically it</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows how they dressed and how they</v>

1489
01:27:41.621 --> 01:27:43.980
<v Speaker 2>lived and what parts of the animal they</v>
<v Speaker 2>ate.</v>

1490
01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:47.830
<v Speaker 2>And so he lived off of what they eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was basically just meat and</v>

1491
01:27:47.831 --> 01:27:51.730
<v Speaker 2>sometimes eggs for five years and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>he came back.</v>

1492
01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:54.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he was in England or in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the States but he came back and said hey</v>

1493
01:27:54.761 --> 01:27:56.620
<v Speaker 2>look how healthy I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I eat is meat.</v>

1494
01:27:56.890 --> 01:28:00.520
<v Speaker 2>This isn't like the 30s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said no way you're supposed to</v>

1495
01:28:00.521 --> 01:28:04.660
<v Speaker 2>have scurvy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So him and his partner who is his last</v>

1496
01:28:04.661 --> 01:28:09.661
<v Speaker 2>names Anderson went to Bellevue horse</v>
<v Speaker 2>hospital and they stayed under monitor</v>

1497
01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:13.120
<v Speaker 2>just eating meat for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are six studies done on them</v>

1498
01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:17.050
<v Speaker 2>and you can find them online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they monitored like vitamin levels.</v>

1499
01:28:17.650 --> 01:28:21.550
<v Speaker 2>They monitor over everything because</v>
<v Speaker 2>kidney function because back then like</v>

1500
01:28:21.551 --> 01:28:24.100
<v Speaker 2>nothing's changed in the last hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>years they said you're supposed to be</v>

1501
01:28:24.101 --> 01:28:27.910
<v Speaker 2>dead of scurvy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm reading that book and he says.</v>

1502
01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:30.760
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the main things they</v>
<v Speaker 2>ate.</v>

1503
01:28:31.150 --> 01:28:32.410
<v Speaker 12>They also didn't eat any salt.</v>

1504
01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:39.290
<v Speaker 3>No they were eating like whale blubber</v>
<v Speaker 3>and seal fat.</v>

1505
01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:44.030
<v Speaker 2>So those lines mostly karibu karibu they</v>
<v Speaker 2>also has a brain though.</v>

1506
01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they I ate he said they gave a lot</v>

1507
01:28:47.631 --> 01:28:52.020
<v Speaker 2>of the really lean cuts to the dogs so</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ate a lot of the fatty or cuts they</v>

1508
01:28:52.021 --> 01:28:53.840
<v Speaker 2>ate the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They eat fat behind.</v>

1509
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:56.750
<v Speaker 2>He goes into some serious detail a fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind the eyes.</v>

1510
01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They boiled a lot.</v>

1511
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:02.930
<v Speaker 2>They boiled bones for the marrow so they</v>
<v Speaker 2>got fat out of that.</v>

1512
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:07.080
<v Speaker 2>And then for part of the year they'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>also eat seal the fat behind the eyes.</v>

1513
01:29:07.130 --> 01:29:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Tastes like it's like bread like dough</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that.</v>

1514
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had that.</v>

1515
01:29:12.710 --> 01:29:14.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did the first deer I shot.</v>

1516
01:29:15.230 --> 01:29:18.760
<v Speaker 3>We eat the fat behind eyes tastes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like good.</v>

1517
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:22.140
<v Speaker 14>No</v>
<v Speaker 14>no</v>

1518
01:29:23.770 --> 01:29:26.600
<v Speaker 14>it's it's not the best guy.</v>

1519
01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:30.580
<v Speaker 3>But it's it's definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just weird like like doe.</v>

1520
01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:34.760
<v Speaker 2>That's weird huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah it's a good book though and it</v>

1521
01:29:34.990 --> 01:29:38.840
<v Speaker 2>there is another person who was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating meat and for some reason people</v>

1522
01:29:38.841 --> 01:29:39.674
<v Speaker 2>have forgotten about him.</v>

1523
01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:44.860
<v Speaker 5>So like maybe the best deal would be</v>
<v Speaker 5>those really fat Japanese cows was Kobe</v>

1524
01:29:45.021 --> 01:29:46.170
<v Speaker 5>beef cows or why.</v>

1525
01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:49.390
<v Speaker 7>Yeah because those are fat as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

1526
01:29:49.730 --> 01:29:53.120
<v Speaker 7>Those things you you look at those</v>
<v Speaker 7>marble cuts and you like when they're</v>

1527
01:29:53.121 --> 01:29:54.620
<v Speaker 7>doing a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1528
01:29:55.130 --> 01:29:56.660
<v Speaker 7>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Probably nothing good.</v>

1529
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:59.480
<v Speaker 7>Yeah I think good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now those poor cows.</v>

1530
01:29:59.570 --> 01:30:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I've been doing recently which is a</v>

1531
01:30:01.491 --> 01:30:05.840
<v Speaker 2>lot cheaper is getting ground beef which</v>
<v Speaker 2>is lean and adding tallow and just</v>

1532
01:30:05.841 --> 01:30:08.990
<v Speaker 2>frying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense and it's way cheaper</v>

1533
01:30:08.991 --> 01:30:13.310
<v Speaker 2>than steak but it's super fatty just</v>
<v Speaker 2>spoonfuls of tallow in there and you</v>

1534
01:30:13.311 --> 01:30:15.320
<v Speaker 2>just eat it is put in a bowl and eat it.</v>

1535
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Are you getting bored with this.</v>

1536
01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:22.090
<v Speaker 2>No no not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So after the first week sucked because</v>

1537
01:30:22.091 --> 01:30:26.830
<v Speaker 2>first line kind of sucks I was one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason it sucked but I was also like</v>

1538
01:30:26.831 --> 01:30:29.470
<v Speaker 2>a missing salad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was having and I only went from Greens</v>

1539
01:30:29.471 --> 01:30:34.471
<v Speaker 2>down so it's a pretty easy transition</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinda by the rest your family almost</v>

1540
01:30:34.761 --> 01:30:36.100
<v Speaker 2>died as well as your whole mass.</v>

1541
01:30:36.490 --> 01:30:39.030
<v Speaker 7>Yeah he's on it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah really.</v>

1542
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:41.320
<v Speaker 7>And how does he have any issues health</v>
<v Speaker 7>issues.</v>

1543
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:45.420
<v Speaker 7>He was depressed and pretty severe</v>
<v Speaker 7>depression really.</v>

1544
01:30:45.730 --> 01:30:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Know what was causing his depression</v>
<v Speaker 2>like foods.</v>

1545
01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:54.010
<v Speaker 2>He had the same issues as me and I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>how that sounds but my dad was like this</v>

1546
01:30:54.111 --> 01:30:56.220
<v Speaker 2>seems to be genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can you have it too.</v>

1547
01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Well but so it's not genetic.</v>

1548
01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:02.250
<v Speaker 12>Hmm that's interesting.</v>

1549
01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Action.</v>

1550
01:31:04.210 --> 01:31:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Well he was like this is a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredulous.</v>

1551
01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Well I mean those food reactions were</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of strange.</v>

1552
01:31:09.670 --> 01:31:12.490
<v Speaker 5>You know people have like weird</v>
<v Speaker 5>sympathetic disorders you know like</v>

1553
01:31:12.850 --> 01:31:16.110
<v Speaker 5>someone around them has something they</v>
<v Speaker 5>start to develop the same sense.</v>

1554
01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:19.210
<v Speaker 2>So that's what dad was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like this though he'll turn</v>

1555
01:31:19.211 --> 01:31:22.090
<v Speaker 2>green his skin turns a different color</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was the wrong thing.</v>

1556
01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:26.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I mean not like green but he gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>pale you can see it.</v>

1557
01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh one thing I wanted to address when I</v>

1558
01:31:29.681 --> 01:31:33.670
<v Speaker 2>was on here in Sean Baker's episode he</v>
<v Speaker 2>said something about eating apples that</v>

1559
01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:36.910
<v Speaker 2>gave him low back pain and you were like</v>
<v Speaker 2>apples give you low back pain and people</v>

1560
01:31:36.911 --> 01:31:40.840
<v Speaker 2>in the comments were freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a symptom that happens to me</v>

1561
01:31:40.841 --> 01:31:44.320
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not over yet when my mood drops</v>

1562
01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:48.940
<v Speaker 2>I get lower back pain and so does dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny to freak out about to get</v>

1563
01:31:48.941 --> 01:31:53.941
<v Speaker 2>it but that's very commonly associated</v>
<v Speaker 2>with depression and it is triggered by</v>

1564
01:31:54.431 --> 01:31:55.540
<v Speaker 2>food with me too.</v>

1565
01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:59.800
<v Speaker 3>Well I know that that's triggered by</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people that have lower back issues</v>

1566
01:31:59.801 --> 01:32:04.030
<v Speaker 3>when they eat and flip inflammation</v>
<v Speaker 3>causing foods like pasta and sugar.</v>

1567
01:32:04.630 --> 01:32:05.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mm hmm.</v>

1568
01:32:06.250 --> 01:32:10.510
<v Speaker 3>So I went to a physical therapist once</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was having had a bulging disc in</v>

1569
01:32:10.511 --> 01:32:13.540
<v Speaker 3>my neck and she suggested that I cut out</v>
<v Speaker 3>gluten.</v>

1570
01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:17.020
<v Speaker 3>I thought she's a crazy person now what</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you talking about cut out gluten.</v>

1571
01:32:17.170 --> 01:32:21.010
<v Speaker 3>My cousin she was I know it sounds crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of these things cause issues</v>

1572
01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:24.650
<v Speaker 3>and they causes inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like the first steps that I</v>

1573
01:32:24.651 --> 01:32:25.960
<v Speaker 3>thought was the first idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gluten.</v>

1574
01:32:26.210 --> 01:32:28.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well also the first steps that I took to</v>

1575
01:32:28.541 --> 01:32:31.270
<v Speaker 3>understand that foods cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation.</v>

1576
01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:34.660
<v Speaker 3>I had never thought of that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought oh no someone yanked on my</v>

1577
01:32:34.661 --> 01:32:36.670
<v Speaker 3>neck and then my next her and tried to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fix it.</v>

1578
01:32:36.730 --> 01:32:40.060
<v Speaker 3>How do you fix my neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And but when she was saying this that</v>

1579
01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:44.680
<v Speaker 3>the reduction of inflammation causing</v>
<v Speaker 3>foods would lead to healing in certain</v>

1580
01:32:44.681 --> 01:32:47.680
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very incredulous.</v>

1581
01:32:48.670 --> 01:32:50.740
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like some fucking wacky car Yeah.</v>

1582
01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>

1583
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:56.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah but there's something to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know there's there's something</v>

1584
01:32:56.190 --> 01:32:58.960
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all the weight reduction soon</v>

1585
01:32:58.961 --> 01:33:03.880
<v Speaker 5>as you cut out all these sugary foods</v>
<v Speaker 5>and your body's just carrying less stuff</v>

1586
01:33:03.881 --> 01:33:05.200
<v Speaker 5>around you carrying less meat.</v>

1587
01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:09.560
<v Speaker 6>I mean and people don't realize how much</v>
<v Speaker 6>it has to do a workout do like a body</v>

1588
01:33:09.561 --> 01:33:11.680
<v Speaker 6>weight workout.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now do that same body weight workout</v>

1589
01:33:11.681 --> 01:33:15.340
<v Speaker 6>with a 40 pound vest on it's way harder</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking way harder.</v>

1590
01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:17.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And most people out there wandering</v>

1591
01:33:17.741 --> 01:33:20.410
<v Speaker 6>around Italy's 40 pounds overweight at</v>
<v Speaker 6>least 40 pounds.</v>

1592
01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:22.600
<v Speaker 6>Yeah it's a lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of weight.</v>

1593
01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:27.850
<v Speaker 6>You know I do this I have this this</v>
<v Speaker 6>backpack that I put metal plates on.</v>

1594
01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:31.120
<v Speaker 6>It's it's by this company called</v>
<v Speaker 6>outdoorsman.</v>

1595
01:33:31.450 --> 01:33:35.560
<v Speaker 6>And it's like a basically leg of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>frame of a hiking backpack.</v>

1596
01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:39.940
<v Speaker 6>He snap it in and it puts an Olympic</v>
<v Speaker 6>plate on the back and locks it in place</v>

1597
01:33:39.941 --> 01:33:42.160
<v Speaker 6>allow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that it really centers in your back</v>

1598
01:33:42.161 --> 01:33:45.670
<v Speaker 6>as opposed to like a lot of people do</v>
<v Speaker 6>weighted hikes but they put sandbags in</v>

1599
01:33:45.671 --> 01:33:47.230
<v Speaker 6>there and it kind of shifts and moves</v>
<v Speaker 6>around.</v>

1600
01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:49.690
<v Speaker 6>But this was like really centers in and</v>
<v Speaker 6>locks it in place.</v>

1601
01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:55.080
<v Speaker 6>But if I do 45 pounds and I go hiking</v>
<v Speaker 6>around like it kind of kicks my ass it's</v>

1602
01:33:55.391 --> 01:34:00.100
<v Speaker 6>hard going up and also 45 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Think about what most people just go</v>

1603
01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:04.570
<v Speaker 6>through life with a lot of people go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your dad was 50 50 pounds overweight.</v>

1604
01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:05.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Think of that.</v>

1605
01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:09.140
<v Speaker 6>It's a lot of weight on that whereas</v>
<v Speaker 6>your ass out that.</v>

1606
01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:12.130
<v Speaker 6>And then that's one of the reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 6>people say they don't have the energy to</v>

1607
01:34:12.131 --> 01:34:16.990
<v Speaker 6>exercise so carrying around all this way</v>
<v Speaker 6>their ass I was like it like really</v>

1608
01:34:16.991 --> 01:34:20.770
<v Speaker 6>heavy overweight persons people and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>look at their legs and like that dude</v>

1609
01:34:20.771 --> 01:34:24.580
<v Speaker 6>probably can kick through a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Someone could teach him how to kick like</v>

1610
01:34:24.581 --> 01:34:27.370
<v Speaker 6>think about how much weight you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>carrying around the time their knees are</v>

1611
01:34:27.371 --> 01:34:31.510
<v Speaker 6>probably super strong like all the</v>
<v Speaker 6>tissue around their legs just constantly</v>

1612
01:34:31.511 --> 01:34:34.250
<v Speaker 6>carrying this heavy load upstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1613
01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:37.180
<v Speaker 6>If you could lose weight you'd probably</v>
<v Speaker 6>have amazing legs.</v>

1614
01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:40.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah yeah yeah yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now look at diet.</v>

1615
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:45.870
<v Speaker 5>So how do you go though from this to</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing consulting and is it.</v>

1616
01:34:46.930 --> 01:34:49.870
<v Speaker 5>Is it a big leap to like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're just trying to figure your</v>

1617
01:34:49.871 --> 01:34:52.440
<v Speaker 5>own life out to try to help other people</v>
<v Speaker 5>online.</v>

1618
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:54.190
<v Speaker 5>You don't have a degree in nutrition or</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

1619
01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:54.760
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1620
01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:57.970
<v Speaker 2>God no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well but what am I going to get a degree</v>

1621
01:34:57.971 --> 01:34:58.990
<v Speaker 2>in nutrition for.</v>

1622
01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.460
<v Speaker 11>They still teach people eat grain so</v>
<v Speaker 11>that was never in the books.</v>

1623
01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:09.520
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that today like if you went</v>
<v Speaker 5>to a university today like a really good</v>

1624
01:35:09.741 --> 01:35:12.230
<v Speaker 5>school do you think there would still be</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying that grains are good.</v>

1625
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:13.183
<v Speaker 5>Good idea to eat.</v>

1626
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:14.083
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1627
01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:19.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that so I could be wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah I would say it's still pretty</v>

1628
01:35:19.371 --> 01:35:24.130
<v Speaker 3>food pyramid de</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't know if they go the old way</v>

1629
01:35:24.131 --> 01:35:28.210
<v Speaker 3>with the like when you read and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>change them as all rice and wheat.</v>

1630
01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:32.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's really changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like eat a good mix of Make</v>

1631
01:35:32.531 --> 01:35:35.810
<v Speaker 2>sure you get your fruits and vegetables</v>
<v Speaker 2>grains.</v>

1632
01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:37.690
<v Speaker 2>That's what they tell you when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnant.</v>

1633
01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:40.810
<v Speaker 2>But for most people I don't think so</v>
<v Speaker 2>grain really.</v>

1634
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:44.050
<v Speaker 2>We've been eating grain for what like</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe twenty thousand years in some</v>

1635
01:35:44.051 --> 01:35:46.750
<v Speaker 2>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More like 10000 years and in some areas</v>

1636
01:35:46.751 --> 01:35:51.460
<v Speaker 2>2000 years and if you're Native American</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 200 years haven't been eating grain</v>

1637
01:35:51.461 --> 01:35:55.210
<v Speaker 2>for very long Why do people suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 2>think they can digest that just because</v>

1638
01:35:55.211 --> 01:36:00.110
<v Speaker 2>we're people</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't believe Rice.</v>

1639
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Rice is a green rice I think is a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>less inflammatory than some grains like</v>

1640
01:36:04.641 --> 01:36:07.520
<v Speaker 2>the gluten grains are obviously a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>harder on people.</v>

1641
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:10.880
<v Speaker 2>And even I tolerated Rice kind of for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>

1642
01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:15.110
<v Speaker 2>But yeah I don't think grains feed a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>

1643
01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:18.040
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why the agricultural error</v>
<v Speaker 2>came around now.</v>

1644
01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:21.320
<v Speaker 2>We can feed tons of people which doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>make people thrive and I don't think</v>

1645
01:36:21.321 --> 01:36:23.660
<v Speaker 2>it's good for their god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's surprising</v>

1646
01:36:23.661 --> 01:36:26.660
<v Speaker 2>considering we haven't been eating it</v>
<v Speaker 2>long enough to evolve with it.</v>

1647
01:36:27.050 --> 01:36:31.760
<v Speaker 5>But other than grain what are the issues</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have with what we would call like a</v>

1648
01:36:31.761 --> 01:36:33.590
<v Speaker 5>paleo diet or a healthy diet.</v>

1649
01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:39.680
<v Speaker 1>So with vegetables and do you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an issue eating vegetables.</v>

1650
01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I think it really depends on the person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that this beef salt and water</v>

1651
01:36:45.531 --> 01:36:50.531
<v Speaker 2>diet is a really good elimination diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're seriously suffering and</v>

1652
01:36:50.601 --> 01:36:54.920
<v Speaker 2>you have nothing to lose you can give it</v>
<v Speaker 2>a go suffer through the transition</v>

1653
01:36:54.921 --> 01:36:58.850
<v Speaker 2>period and then try and once you feel OK</v>
<v Speaker 2>try and reintroduce foods and see where</v>

1654
01:36:58.851 --> 01:36:59.684
<v Speaker 2>you stand.</v>

1655
01:37:00.170 --> 01:37:04.430
<v Speaker 3>What about vitamin supplementation</v>
<v Speaker 3>though and why wouldn't you tell people</v>

1656
01:37:04.431 --> 01:37:08.510
<v Speaker 3>what move why wouldn't you recommend</v>
<v Speaker 3>multivitamins or a multivitamin pack</v>

1657
01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:10.370
<v Speaker 3>that covers all your basics.</v>

1658
01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:14.600
<v Speaker 2>I say if you want if you're really</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned about vitamins get vitamin</v>

1659
01:37:14.601 --> 01:37:18.860
<v Speaker 2>infusions I react to multi vitamins so</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fillers there aren't any pure</v>

1660
01:37:18.861 --> 01:37:21.710
<v Speaker 2>vitamins you can take unless you take</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in powder form so you can get</v>

1661
01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:26.330
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C powder potassium powder but</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to get the other vitamins in</v>

1662
01:37:26.331 --> 01:37:30.950
<v Speaker 2>powder form and I react to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So so even the filler often caps</v>

1663
01:37:32.450 --> 01:37:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I probably wouldn't react to pure</v>
<v Speaker 2>gelatin capsules but like filler what</v>

1664
01:37:36.081 --> 01:37:39.500
<v Speaker 2>kind of filler micro appears to lean</v>
<v Speaker 2>cellulose isn't a lot of them.</v>

1665
01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Why do they put that stuff in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well a lot of them is to bind it</v>

1666
01:37:43.771 --> 01:37:48.000
<v Speaker 2>together you know if it's like a tablet</v>
<v Speaker 2>then most of that is like powdery stuff</v>

1667
01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:50.460
<v Speaker 2>that isn't the actual vitamin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about capsules.</v>

1668
01:37:51.690 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't tested it out like buy because</v>

1669
01:37:55.921 --> 01:37:58.960
<v Speaker 2>it's this month long reaction I pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>much just say get rid of all the</v>

1670
01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:03.060
<v Speaker 2>variables you can get rid of and start</v>
<v Speaker 2>from scratch and then you can see if if</v>

1671
01:38:03.061 --> 01:38:05.850
<v Speaker 2>things are bothering you if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>worried about vitamins get infusions.</v>

1672
01:38:06.330 --> 01:38:08.850
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what I was saying is that you were</v>

1673
01:38:08.851 --> 01:38:12.210
<v Speaker 5>talking about these binders do they</v>
<v Speaker 5>exist in capsules as well.</v>

1674
01:38:13.050 --> 01:38:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah you have to check the ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are just it's very hard to get</v>

1675
01:38:16.351 --> 01:38:20.010
<v Speaker 2>vitamins that are pure unless they're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>powdered form or either by infusion.</v>

1676
01:38:20.130 --> 01:38:24.180
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't find a multivitamin I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a lot of the vitamin KS derived</v>

1677
01:38:24.181 --> 01:38:27.060
<v Speaker 2>from soy so I'll react to that amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>soy.</v>

1678
01:38:27.450 --> 01:38:28.283
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>

1679
01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:31.450
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So infusions you're talking about.</v>

1680
01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah and I did those though I did that</v>
<v Speaker 2>during my pregnancy because just in case</v>

1681
01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:42.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't react to that at all is fine I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't find I didn't see a benefit.</v>

1682
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:47.390
<v Speaker 2>It didn't make me feel any better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you react to fish oil not well</v>

1683
01:38:49.980 --> 01:38:53.580
<v Speaker 2>but it was hard to tell because I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>reacting to other things at the same</v>

1684
01:38:53.581 --> 01:38:57.870
<v Speaker 2>time so I don't I don't eat chicken</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore and I don't eat fish anymore</v>

1685
01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.970
<v Speaker 2>because it doesn't make me feel as good</v>
<v Speaker 2>as beef</v>

1686
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:03.470
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't give you a bad reaction.</v>

1687
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:06.830
<v Speaker 4>Not like soy or grains.</v>

1688
01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:11.030
<v Speaker 3>But what if someone took it to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant and lobster was on the menu.</v>

1689
01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:12.320
<v Speaker 3>You would need a lobster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1690
01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:13.573
<v Speaker 12>Wow.</v>

1691
01:39:16.590 --> 01:39:20.310
<v Speaker 2>No dessert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No but the thing is the cravings go away</v>

1692
01:39:20.610 --> 01:39:24.330
<v Speaker 2>after you transition over so I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>even care how has gone</v>

1693
01:39:26.150 --> 01:39:29.430
<v Speaker 2>three times usually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm doing more I eat more.</v>

1694
01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise I'm eating about two and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>half pounds a day.</v>

1695
01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:34.170
<v Speaker 2>If they're fat fatter then I'll eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>less.</v>

1696
01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.450
<v Speaker 3>To just sort of walking beef</v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe.</v>

1697
01:39:36.690 --> 01:39:38.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great though.</v>

1698
01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:41.820
<v Speaker 2>It's um it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I drink like sparkling water which I</v>

1699
01:39:41.821 --> 01:39:43.920
<v Speaker 2>love Perry excites me.</v>

1700
01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:47.100
<v Speaker 5>So just Perrier and beef and salt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a</v>

1701
01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:50.650
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you think about people that say</v>

1702
01:39:50.651 --> 01:39:55.651
<v Speaker 5>that this idea might work in the short</v>
<v Speaker 5>term in the short term but in the long</v>

1703
01:39:56.231 --> 01:39:57.910
<v Speaker 5>term it's not sustainable.</v>

1704
01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what kind of response</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have to that like</v>

1705
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:05.223
<v Speaker 2>what I was doing.</v>

1706
01:40:05.290 --> 01:40:10.060
<v Speaker 3>For example on vegan diets right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With diets as they start off they feel</v>

1707
01:40:10.061 --> 01:40:12.220
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like Oh my God this is the diet</v>

1708
01:40:12.221 --> 01:40:15.340
<v Speaker 3>for me this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And over time their body starts reacting</v>

1709
01:40:15.341 --> 01:40:20.260
<v Speaker 3>to the lack of nutrients lack of</v>
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol lack of saturated fat and it</v>

1710
01:40:20.261 --> 01:40:23.770
<v Speaker 3>doesn't doesn't in different bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously some people have no</v>

1711
01:40:23.771 --> 01:40:27.430
<v Speaker 3>problem with it but some people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>like legitimate like Chris Crestor is a</v>

1712
01:40:27.431 --> 01:40:30.400
<v Speaker 3>perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started out with a macrobiotic vegan</v>

1713
01:40:30.401 --> 01:40:33.190
<v Speaker 3>diet and had real serious reactions to</v>
<v Speaker 3>it over time.</v>

1714
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:36.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah started out doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then over time started to break his</v>

1715
01:40:36.731 --> 01:40:38.320
<v Speaker 3>body down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long did it take.</v>

1716
01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:42.280
<v Speaker 3>I forget but when he started</v>
<v Speaker 3>reintroducing meat back into his diet he</v>

1717
01:40:42.281 --> 01:40:43.750
<v Speaker 3>had a massive ramp up.</v>

1718
01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:49.150
<v Speaker 2>You know it's ramp up like he got worse</v>
<v Speaker 2>health health while Oh yeah fantastic.</v>

1719
01:40:49.190 --> 01:40:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1720
01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:51.280
<v Speaker 1>And suddenly everything started kicking</v>
<v Speaker 1>in again.</v>

1721
01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not worried about it like I was</v>

1722
01:40:54.641 --> 01:40:59.641
<v Speaker 2>so sick before this and now I'm better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I was concerned I was going to die</v>

1723
01:41:01.241 --> 01:41:03.880
<v Speaker 2>in the long run before and now I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling good.</v>

1724
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:07.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't see why I would just randomly</v>
<v Speaker 2>get sick suddenly I'm getting my</v>

1725
01:41:07.271 --> 01:41:11.710
<v Speaker 2>vitamins tested because people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>curious but I I don't have any symptoms.</v>

1726
01:41:12.130 --> 01:41:15.190
<v Speaker 5>And who is this besides this woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you been in contact with this woman</v>

1727
01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:16.510
<v Speaker 5>that's been doing this for nine years.</v>

1728
01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Not personally no but where were you.</v>

1729
01:41:19.450 --> 01:41:20.820
<v Speaker 5>Somewhere in the States.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mm hmm.</v>

1730
01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:25.630
<v Speaker 5>And so Sean Baker is probably the</v>
<v Speaker 5>loudest proponent and one of the most</v>

1731
01:41:25.631 --> 01:41:30.520
<v Speaker 5>vocal and more most public and he's been</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing it I believe two years</v>

1732
01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:35.800
<v Speaker 5>my friend Chris Bell's been doing it for</v>
<v Speaker 5>a while as well.</v>

1733
01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:39.150
<v Speaker 3>I think he's less than a year but he</v>
<v Speaker 3>apples.</v>

1734
01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:40.413
<v Speaker 3>He loves apples.</v>

1735
01:41:40.810 --> 01:41:44.390
<v Speaker 2>I had a hard time giving up apples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's find Sara.</v>

1736
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Seriously it's because I limited I went</v>
<v Speaker 2>down on all my sugar and then I was</v>

1737
01:41:48.161 --> 01:41:51.560
<v Speaker 2>eating hoards of apples and that was my</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar right.</v>

1738
01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:55.390
<v Speaker 2>And that was hard to kick in apples.</v>

1739
01:41:55.450 --> 01:41:59.080
<v Speaker 3>Somehow or another give you low back</v>
<v Speaker 3>pain among other things.</v>

1740
01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:00.540
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

1741
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:03.310
<v Speaker 3>It comes along with a depression and</v>
<v Speaker 3>arthritis</v>

1742
01:42:05.570 --> 01:42:09.860
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is a really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation because there's so much</v>

1743
01:42:09.861 --> 01:42:13.400
<v Speaker 3>going on with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's and it's not an objective</v>

1744
01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:17.840
<v Speaker 3>conversation for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like many people that get into this they</v>

1745
01:42:17.841 --> 01:42:22.810
<v Speaker 3>get into this it's very charged it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>charged almost politically it's charged</v>

1746
01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:27.880
<v Speaker 3>ideologically it's charged whether it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethically and morally it's it's charged</v>

1747
01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:33.080
<v Speaker 3>where people are very skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also they have this diet that they</v>

1748
01:42:33.081 --> 01:42:36.530
<v Speaker 3>believe in that they've been following.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so anything that's contrary to that</v>

1749
01:42:36.531 --> 01:42:37.364
<v Speaker 3>they reject.</v>

1750
01:42:37.970 --> 01:42:41.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah well I used to be like people when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really sick.</v>

1751
01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:43.250
<v Speaker 2>People come up and go Well have you</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at your diet.</v>

1752
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:49.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like what you like me mean disorder</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm dying have I like what stop eating</v>

1753
01:42:50.091 --> 01:42:52.340
<v Speaker 2>sugar and all my problems will go away</v>
<v Speaker 2>like thanks.</v>

1754
01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:56.600
<v Speaker 2>So I've been on the other end of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum and I used to get mad when</v>

1755
01:42:56.601 --> 01:42:59.540
<v Speaker 2>people said but it was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>condescending right.</v>

1756
01:42:59.690 --> 01:43:01.940
<v Speaker 2>If you'd like tried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you tried exercising have you</v>

1757
01:43:01.941 --> 01:43:04.940
<v Speaker 2>looked at your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No it's like I'm dying.</v>

1758
01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:09.110
<v Speaker 13>And then I thought maybe now that I look</v>
<v Speaker 13>back on it.</v>

1759
01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:12.500
<v Speaker 13>How crazy is it then.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It wasn't even a conversation 10 years</v>

1760
01:43:12.501 --> 01:43:13.340
<v Speaker 13>ago right.</v>

1761
01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:15.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah like ten years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever hear this.</v>

1762
01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:17.330
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1763
01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:21.440
<v Speaker 6>That's what's so weird like the cutting</v>
<v Speaker 6>the sugar out and cutting the carbs out.</v>

1764
01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:26.710
<v Speaker 2>This is so new it's so new and this like</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat diets really now.</v>

1765
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:30.590
<v Speaker 2>And but by the way but when I say new I</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean in terms of like being popular</v>

1766
01:43:30.591 --> 01:43:33.560
<v Speaker 2>really popular like yeah or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have heard us.</v>

1767
01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:37.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah it's it's it's really interesting.</v>

1768
01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:42.540
<v Speaker 3>It's and when I see your dad and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy he is and how he looks so he</v>

1769
01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:45.430
<v Speaker 3>again looks younger it looks thinner.</v>

1770
01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like it's like he's all sucked</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1771
01:43:47.670 --> 01:43:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah looks like yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks healthy.</v>

1772
01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I know he looks like a different person</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the person I knew.</v>

1773
01:43:53.050 --> 01:43:55.390
<v Speaker 2>And I look like a different person than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person I knew.</v>

1774
01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:58.060
<v Speaker 2>My face looks different in a good way.</v>

1775
01:43:58.250 --> 01:44:00.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I think there's something definite</v>

1776
01:44:01.450 --> 01:44:03.520
<v Speaker 5>definitely healthy about getting a lot</v>
<v Speaker 5>of fat.</v>

1777
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is something that I think we've</v>

1778
01:44:06.671 --> 01:44:11.671
<v Speaker 5>ignored with our obsession with carbs</v>
<v Speaker 5>and one of the things that is a giant</v>

1779
01:44:11.861 --> 01:44:16.690
<v Speaker 5>benefit for people that cut the carbs</v>
<v Speaker 5>out is the way you you feel about food.</v>

1780
01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:19.330
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't get these massive craving</v>
<v Speaker 5>my God.</v>

1781
01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to so when I used to go to eat I</v>

1782
01:44:23.511 --> 01:44:28.310
<v Speaker 2>was starving all the time I just felt</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was starving and I'd eat and then</v>

1783
01:44:28.311 --> 01:44:31.310
<v Speaker 2>I would feel so full.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out it was bloating right.</v>

1784
01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:35.660
<v Speaker 2>But I know that I just feel so full that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would literally have to ask people to</v>

1785
01:44:35.661 --> 01:44:39.020
<v Speaker 2>take my plate away or I would keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating because I was starving but</v>

1786
01:44:39.021 --> 01:44:42.830
<v Speaker 2>stuffed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was just my state all the time.</v>

1787
01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:45.680
<v Speaker 3>You know it's fucked up no matter how</v>
<v Speaker 3>full I am.</v>

1788
01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:49.070
<v Speaker 3>If you put a plate of french fries with</v>
<v Speaker 3>salt and in front of me I will go after</v>

1789
01:44:49.071 --> 01:44:51.110
<v Speaker 3>those bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't help myself.</v>

1790
01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:55.580
<v Speaker 3>This I'll eat one Mike is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then with some ketchup like fat</v>

1791
01:44:55.581 --> 01:45:00.581
<v Speaker 3>steak fries that are like kind of well</v>
<v Speaker 3>done ish with some salt them and ketchup</v>

1792
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:06.070
<v Speaker 3>there's just something about that trick</v>
<v Speaker 3>that biological trick that those goddamn</v>

1793
01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:07.160
<v Speaker 3>potatoes play on you.</v>

1794
01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1795
01:45:10.590 --> 01:45:13.590
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of addictive but so addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1796
01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:18.620
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out that even like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of salad I was eating lettuce was</v>

1797
01:45:19.411 --> 01:45:23.250
<v Speaker 2>still kind of addictive because I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>like lettuce cravings lettuce cravings.</v>

1798
01:45:23.490 --> 01:45:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I mean not like my apple cravings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not like my sugar cravings but they were</v>

1799
01:45:27.241 --> 01:45:28.074
<v Speaker 2>that they were there.</v>

1800
01:45:28.230 --> 01:45:33.230
<v Speaker 5>So when you just eat only me your body</v>
<v Speaker 5>takes that meat in through process of</v>

1801
01:45:33.781 --> 01:45:36.470
<v Speaker 5>glucose Genesis converts it to glucose</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1802
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:38.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm.</v>

1803
01:45:38.370 --> 01:45:42.420
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been out of ketosis and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>always in ketosis but my glucose is</v>

1804
01:45:42.421 --> 01:45:45.010
<v Speaker 2>normal that's what's weird.</v>

1805
01:45:45.070 --> 01:45:48.400
<v Speaker 5>The fact that you're always in ketosis</v>
<v Speaker 5>because most people think that if you</v>

1806
01:45:48.401 --> 01:45:49.710
<v Speaker 5>eat try a protein.</v>

1807
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:54.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah but that's the thing is if you like</v>
<v Speaker 2>convert what I'm eating to the fat ratio</v>

1808
01:45:55.410 --> 01:45:57.580
<v Speaker 2>80 percent of my calories or I'm getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>from fat.</v>

1809
01:45:57.790 --> 01:45:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Are you doing this on an app or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1810
01:46:00.250 --> 01:46:05.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm mostly typing in the cuts and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can kind of add in how much tallow I'm</v>

1811
01:46:06.461 --> 01:46:08.050
<v Speaker 2>adding to lean ground beef.</v>

1812
01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:12.100
<v Speaker 5>How much time do you how do you do about</v>
<v Speaker 5>tablespoon or I do it.</v>

1813
01:46:12.490 --> 01:46:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I do it kind of by tablespoon I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just scoop it in.</v>

1814
01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:18.770
<v Speaker 2>But if I if I was measuring it I'd like</v>
<v Speaker 2>four five.</v>

1815
01:46:18.930 --> 01:46:22.960
<v Speaker 6>Who do you heat the tallow up first and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then cook the beef and do it or do you</v>

1816
01:46:22.961 --> 01:46:24.970
<v Speaker 6>kind of like some older guy just mix</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything together.</v>

1817
01:46:26.170 --> 01:46:29.530
<v Speaker 4>It's way more satisfying though because</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating lean ground beef just isn't good.</v>

1818
01:46:30.190 --> 01:46:33.340
<v Speaker 3>It gets drier dry ground elk is even</v>
<v Speaker 3>worse.</v>

1819
01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:38.300
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's delicious but it's so sinewy you</v>

1820
01:46:38.301 --> 01:46:40.480
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I mix it with butter and stuff</v>

1821
01:46:40.481 --> 01:46:40.750
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1822
01:46:40.750 --> 01:46:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just mixing a little.</v>

1823
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:43.143
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

1824
01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:45.720
<v Speaker 9>All.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's going on my voice.</v>

1825
01:46:46.930 --> 01:46:51.930
<v Speaker 1>So when you're you're looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future and you know you're saying OK</v>

1826
01:46:52.630 --> 01:46:57.630
<v Speaker 1>this is going well this is you know much</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than anything I've ever done</v>

1827
01:46:57.881 --> 01:46:59.230
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel so much better.</v>

1828
01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like this is the way you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to eat for the rest of your life.</v>

1829
01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's sustainable.</v>

1830
01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

1831
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:10.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not arguing against it.</v>

1832
01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:14.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm just I'm wondering sustainable in</v>
<v Speaker 2>what way nutritionally.</v>

1833
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:16.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I think so.</v>

1834
01:47:16.190 --> 01:47:19.490
<v Speaker 2>I'll keep getting my vitamins tested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this book that I've been reading</v>

1835
01:47:19.491 --> 01:47:22.040
<v Speaker 2>about this guy lived with anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they ate.</v>

1836
01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:25.340
<v Speaker 2>They were healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have teeth that fell out like</v>

1837
01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:27.290
<v Speaker 2>they weren't sick like were sick.</v>

1838
01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:29.740
<v Speaker 5>The annuals are the people that went up</v>
<v Speaker 5>there anyways.</v>

1839
01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:31.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah but the annuals didn't evolve that</v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

1840
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you stop and think about it I</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean but didn't we evolve that way too.</v>

1841
01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:37.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we can't say we changed like</v>

1842
01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:42.050
<v Speaker 2>10000 years ago in order to eat grain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks like we've evolved to hunt.</v>

1843
01:47:42.450 --> 01:47:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Kinda yeah.</v>

1844
01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah I mean but different people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>grew up in different areas of the world.</v>

1845
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:52.370
<v Speaker 1>I think they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean isn't it been proven that there's</v>

1846
01:47:52.371 --> 01:47:56.510
<v Speaker 1>different nutritional requirements that</v>
<v Speaker 1>different people have if you're you grew</v>

1847
01:47:56.511 --> 01:47:57.410
<v Speaker 1>up in different areas.</v>

1848
01:47:57.800 --> 01:47:59.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No I haven't read that.</v>

1849
01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:02.030
<v Speaker 2>No</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that.</v>

1850
01:48:02.180 --> 01:48:05.450
<v Speaker 1>That diet that people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's there's like some.</v>

1851
01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Some diet that they they try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>was based on bloodwork.</v>

1852
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh the blood type diet.</v>

1853
01:48:14.770 --> 01:48:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that different people that</v>

1854
01:48:18.031 --> 01:48:21.060
<v Speaker 3>have different blood types that they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming from different parts of the</v>

1855
01:48:21.061 --> 01:48:21.570
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1856
01:48:21.570 --> 01:48:23.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1857
01:48:23.670 --> 01:48:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't really look well man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my diet with a summary of your guide</v>

1858
01:48:27.661 --> 01:48:29.420
<v Speaker 2>to zero about diets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

1859
01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:33.780
<v Speaker 2>I know Dad told me like he went over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said I don't think I can eat fish.</v>

1860
01:48:34.170 --> 01:48:37.710
<v Speaker 2>I think fish is giving me a flare up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>my response was like well that's not</v>

1861
01:48:37.711 --> 01:48:40.860
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feel like all I'm eating is meat and I</v>

1862
01:48:40.861 --> 01:48:45.120
<v Speaker 2>still have the same response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I told you I don't eat chicken.</v>

1863
01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:49.420

<v Speaker 2>and now it's like every meal and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom stay you get hate from vegan people.</v>

1905
01:50:57.250 --> 01:51:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'm as inflammatory as</v>

1906
01:51:01.361 --> 01:51:04.450
<v Speaker 2>some people because I can understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're Italy.</v>

1907
01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ideologically possessed.</v>

1908
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:11.110
<v Speaker 2>That's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you go on a vegan diet you cut</v>

1909
01:51:11.111 --> 01:51:12.650
<v Speaker 2>out processed foods you get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dairy.</v>

1910
01:51:12.670 --> 01:51:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Dairy was a huge trigger for me and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel better than I can understand why</v>

1911
01:51:18.971 --> 01:51:22.430
<v Speaker 2>you'd be going around saying the vegan</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet is the way to eat right.</v>

1912
01:51:22.630 --> 01:51:24.880
<v Speaker 2>So I can can I can understand where</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people are coming from.</v>

1913
01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:28.960
<v Speaker 2>If you're ideologically possessed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying well it's the environment</v>

1914
01:51:28.961 --> 01:51:33.770
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff I don't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no I don't get it.</v>

1915
01:51:34.210 --> 01:51:39.210
<v Speaker 2>I've got like a couple of emails about</v>
<v Speaker 2>me spreading lies like well I just don't</v>

1916
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't really don't care.</v>

1917
01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:46.560
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of loonies out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a loony people but that is the</v>

1918
01:51:46.721 --> 01:51:51.190
<v Speaker 5>issue with the the the vegan diet is</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it carries with it a moral high</v>

1919
01:51:51.191 --> 01:51:51.760
<v Speaker 5>ground.</v>

1920
01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:54.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah but other diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

1921
01:51:54.430 --> 01:51:56.500
<v Speaker 2>That's too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That part sucks.</v>

1922
01:51:56.530 --> 01:52:00.400
<v Speaker 2>The people trying to figure out their</v>
<v Speaker 2>health and going to that because it's</v>

1923
01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.830
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to figure something out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's different.</v>

1924
01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole moral thing like just let</v>
<v Speaker 2>it go.</v>

1925
01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:09.990
<v Speaker 5>Well listen I think this is very</v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting stuff.</v>

1926
01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:15.080
<v Speaker 5>You know I don't have your health issues</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think very few people do.</v>

1927
01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:20.640
<v Speaker 5>But obviously for you it's it's made</v>
<v Speaker 5>some massive impact at home and for your</v>

1928
01:52:20.641 --> 01:52:21.540
<v Speaker 5>father as well.</v>

1929
01:52:21.570 --> 01:52:25.150
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's really</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's very very interesting.</v>

1930
01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:27.760
<v Speaker 6>And like I said my friend lives in San</v>
<v Speaker 6>Diego.</v>

1931
01:52:28.270 --> 01:52:30.370
<v Speaker 6>No problems.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean he's he's loving it.</v>

1932
01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:33.510
<v Speaker 6>I know several other people that have</v>
<v Speaker 6>jumped on board as well too and they're</v>

1933
01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:35.110
<v Speaker 6>seeing big benefits from them.</v>

1934
01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:39.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's almost enough to make me</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to try it but you should try.</v>

1935
01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:43.300
<v Speaker 3>Well the problem doesn't take long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I I have hundreds of pounds of wild</v>

1936
01:52:43.301 --> 01:52:45.020
<v Speaker 3>game meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's perfect.</v>

1937
01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:46.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I have to eat it with fat and have</v>

1938
01:52:46.901 --> 01:52:48.310
<v Speaker 3>to figure out a way to get fat into it.</v>

1939
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:50.260
<v Speaker 2>You can order towel here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>

1940
01:52:50.410 --> 01:52:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This order towel.</v>

1941
01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:54.550
<v Speaker 2>It's on it like I haven't I've talked to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like programmers in Silicon</v>

1942
01:52:54.551 --> 01:52:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Valley who've Skype me and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy and they just want to be more</v>

1943
01:52:57.281 --> 01:53:02.281
<v Speaker 2>productive and the cognitive benefits it</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes like six weeks and it's worth just</v>

1944
01:53:02.351 --> 01:53:05.740
<v Speaker 2>seeing what it's like but they get that</v>
<v Speaker 2>just from the ketogenic diet.</v>

1945
01:53:05.890 --> 01:53:08.110
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had people switch off of the</v>

1946
01:53:08.111 --> 01:53:10.990
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's there's something here there's</v>

1947
01:53:10.991 --> 01:53:13.160
<v Speaker 2>really something here and it's worth are</v>
<v Speaker 2>you seeing.</v>

1948
01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:16.570
<v Speaker 2>No I think people would see benefits if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tried it.</v>

1949
01:53:16.690 --> 01:53:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Even healthy people.</v>

1950
01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:19.990
<v Speaker 1>What do you think those benefits are</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from.</v>

1951
01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:26.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if microbiome switch or if</v>

1952
01:53:26.710 --> 01:53:31.330
<v Speaker 2>there's less you're just ingesting less</v>
<v Speaker 2>plant toxin or if it's a toxin.</v>

1953
01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:35.950
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by the wild plants have</v>
<v Speaker 2>like naturally occurring toxins</v>

1954
01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:39.460
<v Speaker 2>depending on the plant to get bugs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>things to stop eating them.</v>

1955
01:53:39.850 --> 01:53:44.850
<v Speaker 2>That's just their defense mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like oscillates that's a big one</v>

1956
01:53:45.070 --> 01:53:49.630
<v Speaker 2>lecterns like all those types of things</v>
<v Speaker 2>are inflammatory and it just seemed like</v>

1957
01:53:49.631 --> 01:53:53.230
<v Speaker 2>we've just found the plants that we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerate as humans we found the plants</v>

1958
01:53:53.231 --> 01:53:56.590
<v Speaker 2>we can tolerate the easiest and don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill us and we eat those and we've bred</v>

1959
01:53:56.591 --> 01:54:01.510
<v Speaker 2>them so that they're easier to eat but</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe removing those from the diet</v>

1960
01:54:01.511 --> 01:54:04.350
<v Speaker 2>seems to help people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it seems like giving it a six week</v>

1961
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:07.980
<v Speaker 2>try</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see a downside.</v>

1962
01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Again I've only I haven't seen anybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>switch back.</v>

1963
01:54:12.750 --> 01:54:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>

1964
01:54:14.130 --> 01:54:18.630
<v Speaker 2>And I've been talking to a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Skype over like periods of months and</v>

1965
01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen anyone switch back</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the healthy people.</v>

1966
01:54:21.780 --> 01:54:22.613
