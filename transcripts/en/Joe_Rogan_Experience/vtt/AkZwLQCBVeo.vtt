1
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:02.761
Dance right?

2
00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:04.860
Bitches round two.

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.870
We make choices like that.

4
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.220
We were on a network.

5
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.180
We would never just say,

6
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:09.421
hey,

7
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:10.254
can we do another hour?

8
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.441
Yeah,

9
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:11.550
let's do another fucking out.

10
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.050
How should we end this shit?

11
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.311
This episode,

12
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:15.540
this episode APP,

13
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.180
we'll call it an episode that is brought to you by Ting Tang,

14
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.160
which is a mobile service.

15
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.450
When they're going to stop calling him,

16
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.160
they were trying to discuss the side that recently,

17
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:25.910
like why do people still call them cell phones and mobile.

18
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.020
They're all smart though.

19
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.480
But mobile means like we can move it with it,

20
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:31.314
right?

21
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.950
Yes,

22
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.360
but it's so smart.

23
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:35.880
It's not just mobile phones or mobile.

24
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:37.170
Now if you have an iPhone,

25
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.450
it's more than just right.

26
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.330
It's not just mobile.

27
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.850
You have an iPhone five that's not just a mobile phone.

28
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:43.590
That motherfucker is a computer in your pocket.

29
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.281
Take pictures,

30
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:45.114
make videos.

31
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.790
So what do you think we should call it?

32
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.830
Better name than a smartphone.

33
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.620
Some of the people in charge of names come up with a better name because fucking

34
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:52.980
job.

35
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.000
The point is ting has phones for sale folks.

36
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.720
Okay.

37
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.700
They use the sprint backbone and they rent time on it and then give you the same

38
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:04.080
service that you would get of yet sprint,

39
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.450
but at a very reasonable rate.

40
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.410
How reasonable.

41
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.730
I'm glad you asked ours.

42
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.140
Your fear,

43
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.150
how 98% of people would save money with Tang.

44
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.500
That's a lot of God damn people.

45
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:18.501
That's almost like saying everybody 98% it's just too fucking Weirdos that

46
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:22.800
somehow or another have strange data usage and they wouldn't save money.

47
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.610
Tina,

48
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.443
Tina has,

49
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.050
the way to set up is you only pay for what you use,

50
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:32.250
which I think is what the whole world is going to have to do in the future

51
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.340
because just like you used to have to pay for long distance.

52
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.750
If you called your friend in New York,

53
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.330
you remember that that is out the window now.

54
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.340
They had to abandon them.

55
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.233
They still got that.

56
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.333
Canada's still has that.

57
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.531
I have a joke.

58
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:44.364
Didn't work.

59
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.480
Oh,

60
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.330
this guy asking about his cell phone and second,

61
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.210
it's not long distance.

62
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:48.471
I'm like,

63
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:48.620
wait,

64
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.680
it's never long distance.

65
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.921
Oh,

66
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:50.754
they had a candidate.

67
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.390
What do you mean?

68
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.223
What do you mean?

69
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.700
They also have socialized medicine.

70
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.700
You gotta take the good with the bad pros and cons,

71
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.903
pros and cons.

72
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.080
Um,

73
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.300
but what they do is they only charge you for what you use.

74
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.640
So because of that,

75
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.910
like you don't have like a lot of people that will have a plan a hundred minutes

76
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:08.754
or whatever the hell it is.

77
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.530
A lot of times you use way less than that,

78
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:11.610
especially with phone calls.

79
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:13.110
Who the fuck makes phone calls anymore?

80
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.800
Or probably way less phone calls than you?

81
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.700
You would just a few years ago because people tech soap so much,

82
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.700
but you oftentimes don't use all your minutes,

83
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.290
but you don't get credit for those.

84
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.660
And Ting used to do that now they used to give you credit,

85
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.300
but now they said,

86
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.680
you know what?

87
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.700
We got a better way to do this.

88
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.410
It's just pay for what you fucking use.

89
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.891
Oh really?

90
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:33.210
No early termination fees,

91
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:34.350
no cancellation fees.

92
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:36.720
Pay for what you get and use it while you're paying for it.

93
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.350
Hits.

94
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.600
I was hitting the game of spades.

95
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:41.790
Jesus fucking Christ someone get it right.

96
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.610
They also have the best android phones that you could buy.

97
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:45.660
All the cool ones,

98
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:48.840
all the fascinating new gadgets.

99
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.710
Um,

100
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.280
they have,

101
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.520
uh,

102
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.970
the uh,

103
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.650
Samsung Galaxy s three,

104
00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:53.484
they have that,

105
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.820
that modot modot Max that we were talking about.

106
00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:57.400
They have a,

107
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.580
that LG g flex galaxy

108
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.670
<v 1>s five galaxy note three is what I meant to say.</v>

109
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.350
And that HTC,

110
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.790
the HTC one,

111
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:07.421
the m eight,

112
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:08.590
which is pretty fucking slick.

113
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
A lot of really cool shit.

114
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.570
All the best and most groovy new cell phones.

115
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.920
And if you use rogan.ting.com,

116
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.270
you can save yourself $25 off any new phone,

117
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.520
rogan.ting.com.

118
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.800
All right,

119
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.660
Arash fears here.

120
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.220
This is what we call a pod cast debt park us debt.

121
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.750
So we will do an abbreviated version of the commercials.com is the size of most

122
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:35.800
people's pulled podcasts.

123
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.460
Fuck them.

124
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.970
Fuck them.

125
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.250
People give you music.

126
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.093
Yon Jamie,

127
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.090
two Oh nine breaths.

128
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.560
What happens in Brian's not here.

129
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.180
The whole place goes to shit.

130
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.900
Look at you showing tin can run all night.

131
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:51.840
Know what the fuck your train.

132
00:03:51.841 --> 00:03:54.100
And then the night comes and he's got it right.

133
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.980
Get it right.

134
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:55.813
You Ready?

135
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.823
Did you get it right?

136
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.850
All fucked up.

137
00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.971
Oh,

138
00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:58.630
you're a mass.

139
00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.830
But can the folks here us.

140
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.810
Okay.

141
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.081
Well,

142
00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:01.810
okay,

143
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.800
we don't need that music.

144
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.420
We were just having the music wants today.

145
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.020
Yeah.

146
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.621
We probably,

147
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:06.460
we got greedy.

148
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.801
Tried to,

149
00:04:06.801 --> 00:04:07.750
to double music.

150
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.770
It can't do that.

151
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:09.850
It's not two for Tuesday.

152
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.980
Ours you fear as so many stories about China.

153
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:14.710
We talked about so many other things besides the stories about China,

154
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:15.940
which side we have to keep going.

155
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:18.250
So you were about to tell some crazy noodle story.

156
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.850
Oh yeah.

157
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.990
So they had these street meat,

158
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.800
which is great.

159
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.640
And this is Shanghai.

160
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:22.480
That's me.

161
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.470
I knocked into this table.

162
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.141
I was like,

163
00:04:24.141 --> 00:04:26.440
it sounded like a fucking truck fell over outside.

164
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.880
Uh,

165
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.091
yeah.

166
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:28.924
Shanghai.

167
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.950
But uh,

168
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:30.341
they were like,

169
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:31.440
be careful there meets great.

170
00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:31.810
You just,

171
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:32.531
there's kebabs.

172
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:32.981
You pick it up,

173
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:33.520
they roast it,

174
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.353
give it back to you.

175
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.440
The 0.3,

176
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:35.801
two,

177
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:36.634
whatever it is,

178
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.300
um,

179
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.040
for how much money you can get by with gesturing.

180
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.400
I learned hello and thank you.

181
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.780
Those are the only words I really do.

182
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.793
Huh?

183
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.643
Know,

184
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.080
I know that Ni Hao Kailand to show my kids watch Kylie.

185
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.530
Yeah,

186
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.363
that's cool.

187
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.221
That's crazy.

188
00:04:57.221 --> 00:04:58.054
I can let her stuff.

189
00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.180
Yeah.

190
00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.560
So That's,

191
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.131
we say shush.

192
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:00.400
Shush,

193
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.710
Shush.

194
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.040
Shush.

195
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.840
It's like thank you.

196
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.380
Ah,

197
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.930
okay.

198
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:03.820
That's also used some other way,

199
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:04.450
but I don't know.

200
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.201
So how do you,

201
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:05.860
um,

202
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.550
gesturing,

203
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.350
I got sick at gesturing really except a couple of times I would like big about

204
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:13.120
to go into like a noodle store or something like,

205
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.130
like a shop and I have to call my friend.

206
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.090
They gave you burner phones,

207
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:16.924
which is nice.

208
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.831
I could use and was like,

209
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:17.981
hey,

210
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:19.660
how do you say noodles and how do you say beef?

211
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.040
And I tell her both words.

212
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:21.760
I'm just go in.

213
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.593
I'd be like,

214
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.170
what?

215
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.501
What was it?

216
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:23.831
I forgot.

217
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:24.250
Now,

218
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.820
man,

219
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.300
man,

220
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.530
man is noodles.

221
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.963
And uh,

222
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.560
one of the guys from the Matrix movie is the word for beef.

223
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.020
Who's the black guy from the Matrix?

224
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.883
Morpheus.

225
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.760
Okay.

226
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.593
What's the main guy?

227
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.070
His neo.

228
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.380
Neo,

229
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.190
yeah.

230
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.930
Yeah.

231
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:41.890
That's how you say beef

232
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.621
and was the other one.

233
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:46.240
That was the noodles man.

234
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.450
Same Yen Yao or neo and I don't know,

235
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:50.700
but I said that and then they're like,

236
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.060
they pointed the fucking menu.

237
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:53.170
Like there's 18 things.

238
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:53.411
I'm like,

239
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:53.771
lady,

240
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:54.604
come on,

241
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.060
you can see me struggling with if I'm,

242
00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.020
and I come in and go beef noodle,

243
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.940
just pick something for him.

244
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:03.850
Listened to and just make something new saying this,

245
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.160
the amazing racist where if you would be like [inaudible]

246
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:10.610
you fuck

247
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.810
other parodies sketches.

248
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.530
Sure.

249
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.210
Yeah.

250
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.770
Horse.

251
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.910
It doesn't really feel that way ladies and gentlemen.

252
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.190
The comments on those are the best parts about it.

253
00:06:23.191 --> 00:06:25.590
I got so angry you for those comments with the best.

254
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.933
Yeah.

255
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.030
Little man argue back and forth.

256
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.260
It still goes angry,

257
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.363
angry fuck heads.

258
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.330
So the noodles,

259
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.330
so they have these noodles is treat noodles you can get and I was advised the

260
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:38.450
first day like you don't want those and why someone's video that I can send you

261
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:38.751
right now.

262
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:39.584
You can put up,

263
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.100
oh,

264
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.320
but they are here.

265
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:42.920
Put your,

266
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.720
put your email in here and then just send it to me.

267
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.963
I said,

268
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.770
you can just send it to yourself,

269
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.633
but uh,

270
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.080
so the get the oil,

271
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.200
what they would do is they would go to the sewer,

272
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.970
they would take raw sewage out of the sewer and then boil it down.

273
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.070
The way they'd make wax hash wax,

274
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.430
they'd boil off the sewage and whatever was left.

275
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.810
That's cooking oil that they would use.

276
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.260
It's super fucking harmful and it sell to like a lot of the street noodle guys.

277
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.061
Yeah.

278
00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:16.160
That face is what I made that same phase.

279
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.990
They were cooking with sewer oil,

280
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:18.824
Bro.

281
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.450
It was going around.

282
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.090
So it's not common,

283
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.490
but it was possible.

284
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.110
So it's not like that's the only way they do it.

285
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.351
No,

286
00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:29.480
but the street places where like you run a risk here,

287
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.440
it's cheaper oil.

288
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:31.761
All mine,

289
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:33.080
there's got that source.

290
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.280
Oh my God,

291
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.391
what is this?

292
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:36.770
China's food production of course.

293
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.680
Gimme some gutter oil making of gutter oil.

294
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.461
Gimme some volume.

295
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:41.030
Jamie,

296
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:41.900
Jesus Christ.

297
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.330
<v 2>Thanks all in a day's work for this woman.</v>

298
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.430
She opens up a manhole cover and scoops out as much slop as she can.

299
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.300
Delighted by what she finds.

300
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.200
What's tell this might view is revolting.

301
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.940
She sees as a bonanza,

302
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.290
works in the streets at the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen,

303
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.660
a foot soldier in China,

304
00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:04.670
so called Gutter oil industry.

305
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.883
<v 1>Oh</v>

306
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:09.230
my,

307
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.741
seriously.

308
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:11.670
Almost through swaps.

309
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.830
Gagged.

310
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.120
<v 2>She says she's made enough money to build a house for her family back in her</v>

311
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:17.421
home.

312
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:19.700
Village miles to the north.

313
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:20.690
People are just awful.

314
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.790
She's scooping out to up.

315
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.950
Eventually winds up in a processing plant like this one where it's combined with

316
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:28.970
other animal fat.

317
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.730
Refuse to create recycled cooking.

318
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:36.731
Oil workers put the oil in barrels for delivery to restaurant four days.

319
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.320
How can you eat this?

320
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:40.380
If you eat it,

321
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.213
it can kill you.

322
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.950
Cooking oil has long been a cherished commodity in China.

323
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.360
What's the frying in a walk is the mainstay of daily meal preparation.

324
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.770
The high profit margins from gutter oil production of Provan irresistible

325
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.880
Chinese experts estimate that one 10th of China's cooking law is gutter oil,

326
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.260
which has been found to contain carcinogens and other toxins harmful for humans.

327
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.520
You think water is bad for you?

328
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.840
Breaking news and among street food vendors of production sites often discovered

329
00:09:17.611 --> 00:09:22.330
after people living nearby notice or nauseating stench and alert the

330
00:09:22.331 --> 00:09:23.000
authorities.

331
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
It's really cooking your food.

332
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.690
Police have arrested scores of people across the country in recent years through

333
00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:32.550
engaging in the trade and sees thousands of tons of the material.

334
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:33.390
Look at these guys,

335
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.530
fake the Chinese,

336
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.440
drawing it out a little bit.

337
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.360
Fairly harsh penalties for producers of tainted products,

338
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.000
but many consumers doubt that China's dinner tables can be completely free of

339
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.893
guttural.

340
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.550
All we can do as accepted in our current society,

341
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.860
everybody tries to swindle everybody else.

342
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.730
There's nothing we can do about wow.

343
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.730
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

344
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.470
that's a Fox gusting.

345
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.900
What that takes discussing to whole new level.

346
00:10:05.901 --> 00:10:08.810
I have never pouring it from the bucket.

347
00:10:08.811 --> 00:10:11.180
You hear the go get that sound bite?

348
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.043
No.

349
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:12.920
Does that too.

350
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.060
I almost threw up.

351
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.040
I had to look away.

352
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.620
That's the first time I've ever had to look away on a show.

353
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.790
Really?

354
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.240
Yeah.

355
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.170
That's amazing.

356
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.330
Cause you knew where I was headed to someone's food,

357
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:23.841
Dude.

358
00:10:23.841 --> 00:10:25.790
I almost threw up watching that,

359
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.790
so I did not have any of the street noodles.

360
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.040
I did have a lot of noodles though.

361
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.630
Oh my gosh.

362
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.820
Street noodles motherfucker man.

363
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.570
But that you might've had some gutter oil.

364
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:37.404
Absolutely.

365
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.930
I absolutely might've hot.

366
00:10:38.931 --> 00:10:41.060
So what the fuck man,

367
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.590
I would like to know if you had got her oil.

368
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.600
I probably forgot to assume when I see that when it said where it was like I

369
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:46.910
probably had some gutter oil.

370
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.420
I would like to know how do you think we could find out when my friend was there

371
00:10:50.421 --> 00:10:52.490
said it was like yeah I'm going to an eight it for a little while.

372
00:10:52.491 --> 00:10:55.490
You know I got an a kick of eating it this way before the expos they came out

373
00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:01.100
had a lot of diarrhea and it was a lot because you're eating shit cause you're

374
00:11:01.101 --> 00:11:02.510
eating someone else's shit.

375
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.600
That guy we boil it,

376
00:11:05.601 --> 00:11:08.600
we put a flame under it is to me,

377
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:09.590
you know what it's like when you,

378
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.980
when you see like the worst case scenarios about China and like then did you

379
00:11:12.981 --> 00:11:16.250
ever see that HBO documentary about sitting them selling bay?

380
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.113
I think it was HBO.

381
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.780
There were selling children like Oh God,

382
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.940
guys were selling like their two year old children.

383
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.250
This one boy with screaming cause his dad sold his brother away.

384
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:25.970
Whoa.

385
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:26.660
Yeah.

386
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.710
Deep Dark Shit.

387
00:11:27.711 --> 00:11:30.980
And they were interviewing the guy who sold his kid and he was like,

388
00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:31.131
look,

389
00:11:31.131 --> 00:11:31.821
I didn't have any money.

390
00:11:31.821 --> 00:11:32.211
I had a kid,

391
00:11:32.211 --> 00:11:32.960
I had a the kid.

392
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.500
Wow.

393
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.250
Yeah,

394
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:35.720
it's really fucked up.

395
00:11:35.721 --> 00:11:36.920
I mean really fucked up.

396
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.380
But to me when I see stuff like that,

397
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.720
when I see that guy that was saying that,

398
00:11:41.721 --> 00:11:43.720
you know people swindle people when it,

399
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.560
you see the whole gutter oil thing,

400
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.060
it's like humanity.

401
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.510
If it,

402
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:52.100
she gets bad if people were in a basket but people go bad,

403
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.060
they go real bad.

404
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.771
I compartmentalize.

405
00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:54.520
They don't like this.

406
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.040
I'm not concerned with who gets those.

407
00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.350
Like they just don't think about it like that.

408
00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.090
I'm sure it's okay.

409
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.220
That lady was telling me I have bought a house.

410
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.380
You bought a house by feeding people shit.

411
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.620
How much shit did you have to shovel to get your house?

412
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.920
And you have to continue shoveling shit in order to pay for that house.

413
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.530
I assume they have mortgages over there.

414
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:12.490
Do they have mortgages?

415
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.170
She's not buying a house with cash,

416
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:15.004
like showing up.

417
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.153
I don't think so.

418
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.590
Big fucking stack of paper,

419
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.881
Dude.

420
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:19.600
That's insane.

421
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.560
That was critic growth.

422
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.880
That's beyond gross.

423
00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:23.860
I almost threw up on a podcast.

424
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:24.940
I'm never done that before.

425
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.750
That thick plopping sound to die hosted fear factor.

426
00:12:28.751 --> 00:12:29.584
For instance.

427
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.420
I've seen some shit.

428
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.610
I'm not a regular person in that regard.

429
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:38.530
I seen more disgusting shit than almost any other person who's a comedian.

430
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.043
Yeah.

431
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.220
Up Close and person right there and helped people get through eating.

432
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.403
Never.

433
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.590
And I got nauseous from that smell the shit.

434
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.953
Put it up.

435
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:50.891
That sound made.

436
00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:51.970
It's though descriptive.

437
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:52.781
Yeah.

438
00:12:52.781 --> 00:12:53.614
The block.

439
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.341
I really,

440
00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:56.830
I got that weird tingle in my throat.

441
00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.350
I know controller.

442
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.240
Oh,

443
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.500
what is horrible.

444
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.360
Yeah.

445
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.810
Brian Calvin told me he was in China and uh,

446
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:09.220
they were at a restaurant and the restaurant had pigs underneath the restaurant

447
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:10.820
and running around.

448
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.410
Yeah.

449
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.350
They were liking containers underneath the restaurant and they realized,

450
00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:18.910
his mom asked and realize that when you shit the shit was going down to where

451
00:13:18.911 --> 00:13:19.301
the pigs,

452
00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:20.740
where the pigs are eating your shit.

453
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.180
Human Shit.

454
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:24.490
Oh gross.

455
00:13:24.491 --> 00:13:27.750
And then you're being [inaudible] even the pigs mother fucker.

456
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.080
That's unfortunate.

457
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:30.783
You think,

458
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.860
I mean and they're doing it old school style.

459
00:13:32.861 --> 00:13:33.790
You're shitting in a hole.

460
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:36.820
You're squatting like you were talking about in the first podcast before this

461
00:13:36.821 --> 00:13:38.330
one where you're talking about podcasts.

462
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:38.680
We did.

463
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:38.891
Yeah,

464
00:13:38.891 --> 00:13:40.120
we did another podcast couple,

465
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.153
couple of hours ago.

466
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.060
Um,

467
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.070
Ari was talking about how you'd go into these bathrooms and there's a hole in

468
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:46.150
the ground that's your toilet.

469
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.100
So underneath that whole pigs,

470
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.680
just wait and see.

471
00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.270
That's how fucking good.

472
00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:58.961
But again,

473
00:13:58.961 --> 00:14:00.480
that's what happens when people just get,

474
00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:01.420
when it goes bad,

475
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.591
play that noise again.

476
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:03.190
Jamie,

477
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:03.700
don't do it.

478
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.780
Just play that noise alone.

479
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:05.440
Don't do it.

480
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.273
That's that part.

481
00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:06.941
Just queue it up.

482
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:07.181
And kids,

483
00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:08.050
we knew all her,

484
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:08.903
all

485
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.583
that Plop,

486
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:11.970
plop,

487
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:12.161
plop,

488
00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:12.461
plop,

489
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:13.241
plop is there.

490
00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:17.770
The hashish in a Hong Kong was cut with up to up to 25% gutter oil.

491
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:18.670
Nope.

492
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.430
Shoe Polish through hard percentage for me,

493
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.490
but there wasn't California weed there.

494
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.630
25% show up to up to God damn.

495
00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.190
Just because they want it to make it big.

496
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.033
Make it make more.

497
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.940
God damn that's so grow kind of looks like shoe Polish.

498
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.230
Tell us you can't really tell.

499
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.790
Yeah man.

500
00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:37.571
It's fucking me up.

501
00:14:37.571 --> 00:14:37.870
Like,

502
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:38.380
yeah,

503
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:38.891
it's not good.

504
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:39.790
We'd show.

505
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.230
Imagines just fucking you up.

506
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.380
What does Hash Cup with shoe Polish smell like?

507
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.273
I don't know.

508
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.710
It's got to have us Turpin tiny service smell to it.

509
00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:48.640
You know that smell,

510
00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.541
you know those cans.

511
00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:53.120
You'd open up your grandpa's shoe Polish and you smell it.

512
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:53.330
It's,

513
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.163
yeah,

514
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.390
there was a little,

515
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.680
you know and it was like those little circular cans.

516
00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.810
I keep it moist or something.

517
00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.201
I don't know.

518
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:00.471
I'm saying,

519
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:00.980
I'm saying to you,

520
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.970
this signs the circular ones.

521
00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:02.091
I know.

522
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:04.760
Maybe we shine on shabbos shoes with us.

523
00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:05.200
Yes.

524
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.950
Spit spit on a rock.

525
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:07.520
Yeah,

526
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.630
just rub it on there.

527
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.960
We had the ones brushes too,

528
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.130
where you can use an old smart though,

529
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.470
like do you see those guys at the airport now?

530
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.341
Like shoe shiners,

531
00:15:16.341 --> 00:15:17.180
the shoe shine guys,

532
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:18.043
but that's,

533
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.460
you never see those anywhere else.

534
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:20.870
It's the airport and that's it.

535
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.180
They come around business businesses.

536
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:26.750
Sometimes in New York they'll go door to d c to this guy used to come to like

537
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.570
art or law firm or he would go like each business like once a week.

538
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.340
Have you ever seen one in La at a business?

539
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:32.420
I mean it must be so I'm going,

540
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:33.380
am I in a business?

541
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:33.831
Why now?

542
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:34.580
Are you in a business?

543
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.240
You know what I mean?

544
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.260
In an office building,

545
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.390
whenever you're a in your fucking apartment,

546
00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:39.224
you were in a business.

547
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.700
That's the beautiful thing about being a comic.

548
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.570
Yeah,

549
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.750
I got some technically in my business or you're in the business of writing

550
00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:45.860
fucked up things down.

551
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.480
They will eventually become jokes.

552
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.743
That's a business.

553
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.210
Might not be your business,

554
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.350
but it's a fucking ned to the,

555
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:52.820
to the,

556
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.260
to the heat on it's business.

557
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.660
I'm a beat off on myself and watch cartoon in my computer with me.

558
00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:57.563
Some research

559
00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:00.310
cause it right off.

560
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.130
This is right off time.

561
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.110
I'm hoping that he watching all this porn,

562
00:16:03.111 --> 00:16:07.900
I can come up with a joke about me watching all this porn and if not so be it to

563
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:08.743
have shit.

564
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:09.111
Yeah.

565
00:16:09.111 --> 00:16:11.900
That's the beautiful thing about being a comic at anything you're interested in.

566
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.370
Like anything you pursue online could potentially be a ball research.

567
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.700
Yeah.

568
00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.390
You could mean literally anything,

569
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.750
any idea that you read online that you find fascinating,

570
00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:21.590
you can find.

571
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:22.790
If it strikes you,

572
00:16:22.791 --> 00:16:24.950
you can find a comic angle to it.

573
00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:25.460
Wow.

574
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:25.900
Yeah,

575
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.260
yeah,

576
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:26.830
yeah.

577
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:27.170
Exactly.

578
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.630
Anything you care about enough to look at.

579
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.470
And it's almost like today we're spoiled because every day there's some new

580
00:16:33.471 --> 00:16:35.450
ridiculous story that goes on.

581
00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:38.360
It could be like an awesome bit and they just keep flying by

582
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:40.331
and they're like,

583
00:16:40.331 --> 00:16:40.971
oh no guys,

584
00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:43.130
don't forget about the story because I'm already doing a bit about it.

585
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:44.321
Well,

586
00:16:44.321 --> 00:16:46.250
you even if people forget about it,

587
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.010
you can re you know the idea,

588
00:16:49.011 --> 00:16:52.100
but the idea is that you forget about them because there's so many of another

589
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:52.860
one comes by.

590
00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.400
Just all constantly retweeting things where I'm like,

591
00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.243
what?

592
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.440
Like I'll retweet it and go,

593
00:16:57.441 --> 00:16:58.430
I got to write a bit about that,

594
00:16:58.431 --> 00:16:59.180
but it's,

595
00:16:59.180 --> 00:16:59.850
it just goes,

596
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.510
it goes by the wayside because it's just too much shit.

597
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:03.920
There's so much.

598
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.360
If you look online,

599
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:08.690
like if you have a bunch of good Twitter feeds that you follow,

600
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.450
you'll find some of the most ridiculous articles to store.

601
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.250
A guy got a new lot know fucking American tourist got to cotton,

602
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.390
a giant vaginas statute in Germany.

603
00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:18.623
He had a rescue,

604
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.150
the billboard for that.

605
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.410
Another billboard preview.

606
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.090
Nope.

607
00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:23.750
Lab site has a lot of things.

608
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:24.680
The headline,

609
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.490
just the one word,

610
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.690
the tops top of that.

611
00:17:26.691 --> 00:17:31.280
What the US student is rescued from a giant vagina sculpture in Germany.

612
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.710
You find it on my Twitter feed there too.

613
00:17:33.711 --> 00:17:34.470
They laugh at us.

614
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.971
How stupid.

615
00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:35.400
We are.

616
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.080
Dumb as fuck.

617
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.720
They let us look at this fucking giant vagina.

618
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:40.040
Yeah.

619
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.540
He's got his legs trapped in there,

620
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.433
fucking idiot.

621
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.030
The firemen had to kind and get them out.

622
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:45.381
What do you step in?

623
00:17:45.381 --> 00:17:47.690
And then they should have just hacked his legs off with an ax.

624
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.111
It,

625
00:17:48.111 --> 00:17:48.950
she came over,

626
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.620
left leg,

627
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.453
the leg in there.

628
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.150
She just grabbed the ax and he would have figured out a way to get out.

629
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:53.351
No,

630
00:17:53.351 --> 00:17:53.521
no,

631
00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:53.641
no,

632
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:53.821
no,

633
00:17:53.821 --> 00:17:53.981
no,

634
00:17:53.981 --> 00:17:54.161
no.

635
00:17:54.161 --> 00:17:54.550
Wait,

636
00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:55.310
I'm sorry.

637
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.190
I called nine one one.

638
00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.203
Sorry.

639
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.653
Hack.

640
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:01.500
Chop,

641
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.333
chop.

642
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:04.800
Just let me try to get my right leg out.

643
00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:05.200
No,

644
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:05.400
no.

645
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.270
Chop Chop.

646
00:18:06.271 --> 00:18:06.601
I realize.

647
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:07.321
Not even stuck though.

648
00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:08.560
Let me just shut up.

649
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.673
Shop.

650
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.611
Yeah,

651
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:12.780
the vagina sculpture.

652
00:18:12.781 --> 00:18:13.201
First of all,

653
00:18:13.201 --> 00:18:14.510
why do you have a vagina sculpture?

654
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:14.971
Germany.

655
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:15.930
You fucking Weirdos.

656
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.010
Like what is that about?

657
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:17.710
Germany.

658
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:18.543
Mozambique.

659
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.430
What an odd choice to have a fucking vagina sculpture outside.

660
00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:24.481
But me.

661
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:25.314
Meanwhile,

662
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.690
vaginas are fucking super important.

663
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:28.250
Yeah,

664
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.083
they're inviting.

665
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:29.371
Yeah.

666
00:18:29.371 --> 00:18:30.440
If it wasn't for Vaginas,

667
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:31.590
there'd really be no people.

668
00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:32.760
Of course we're supposed to get inside it.

669
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.860
But isn't that funny that for whatever reason,

670
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.140
like it's a bad time to have a vagina sculpture.

671
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.110
You can have a sculpture of a woman's face.

672
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:41.270
Yep.

673
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:42.103
That's no problem.

674
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:42.931
No problem.

675
00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:43.764
No controversy.

676
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.431
Controversy,

677
00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:45.090
shoulders,

678
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:45.923
shoulders,

679
00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:46.800
shoulders,

680
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.190
showing the boob off man boobs get tricky with those.

681
00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:51.323
Cover the boobs.

682
00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.310
As long as the boobs are colored and you're an angel,

683
00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:54.050
that's okay.

684
00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:54.660
You're an angel.

685
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.280
Forget about it.

686
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.820
And Angel thing like that.

687
00:18:56.821 --> 00:18:58.230
Your town square but a vagina.

688
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.480
That's when I don't like that.

689
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.720
It looks like a vagina to,

690
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.260
if you scroll down Jamie,

691
00:19:04.261 --> 00:19:07.830
there's a picture of this fucking poor slob was goofy glasses.

692
00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:08.040
Yeah.

693
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.430
This headline was it poor slob gets stuck in a statue.

694
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:11.761
Yeah.

695
00:19:11.761 --> 00:19:13.140
Look at this vagina statue.

696
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.213
What's that?

697
00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:15.613
You find the image?

698
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:16.231
I found foot.

699
00:19:16.231 --> 00:19:17.160
The more photos of it.

700
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.910
Oh this fucking crazy bitch got so far down.

701
00:19:20.911 --> 00:19:25.500
It's so stuffed into this thing that he couldn't move his legs like they had to

702
00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:27.300
figure out how to get him out of that thing.

703
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.190
We don't play that.

704
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:30.220
Just show that.

705
00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.790
Just go to photos cause this is the kind of shit that gets us kicked off of

706
00:19:32.791 --> 00:19:33.150
Youtube.

707
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:33.331
Yeah,

708
00:19:33.331 --> 00:19:33.601
he go,

709
00:19:33.601 --> 00:19:33.950
there he is.

710
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:34.670
Oh Wow.

711
00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:35.131
Look at this.

712
00:19:35.131 --> 00:19:36.900
Fuck the eyes is another one with its face.

713
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:37.763
We should shame him,

714
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:38.580
so,

715
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:39.301
oh wow.

716
00:19:39.301 --> 00:19:42.560
So He fell over or something and then he couldn't claim like an idiot and he's

717
00:19:42.561 --> 00:19:42.651
like,

718
00:19:42.651 --> 00:19:43.500
he's got smushed.

719
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.860
He got stuck or it's a gag.

720
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.550
It could be a stunt because that looks pretty tight in his legs though.

721
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:51.661
It does,

722
00:19:51.661 --> 00:19:55.040
but so does he always got to put everything up like it's possible as a stunt.

723
00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:55.890
Yeah,

724
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:56.723
always.

725
00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:57.603
It looks like it.

726
00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.793
If I had to guess,

727
00:19:59.120 --> 00:19:59.880
it looks like it's thought.

728
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.101
Yeah,

729
00:20:00.101 --> 00:20:02.560
he's 22 firefighters had to pry him open.

730
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.180
Oh my God.

731
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:04.470
Wow.

732
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.670
22 firefighters.

733
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.740
They probably got jerked off on him to lube it up.

734
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.060
That'd be great.

735
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:09.670
That'd be great.

736
00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:10.700
No magic.

737
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.060
There's only one way to do this.

738
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.690
We've got to jerk off on my legs.

739
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.440
That's the only way you up his legs.

740
00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.330
It's fucking Americans.

741
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.170
What does it feel like telling people in another country like China that you're

742
00:20:22.171 --> 00:20:22.641
American?

743
00:20:22.641 --> 00:20:23.340
Do they just go,

744
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.850
oh well the other Chinese people,

745
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:27.960
you didn't really talk too much.

746
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.100
You didn't talk to them much.

747
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:29.641
Barely.

748
00:20:29.641 --> 00:20:30.900
The only thing was the spoken English.

749
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.790
You hanging out with the Chinese ladies?

750
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:33.160
Yeah.

751
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:33.750
One bump,

752
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:34.400
bump bump.

753
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.660
I'm Brown.

754
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.940
She was at this bar that I like,

755
00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.470
that's I performed that are like right next door in this area.

756
00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.030
Um,

757
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.110
I thought she was in my show,

758
00:20:43.111 --> 00:20:44.490
but then later I wasn't positive.

759
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.800
Apparently they have a thing according to this guy who posted on the Rogan

760
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:53.500
board,

761
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.370
he lives in China,

762
00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.580
but they have a thing for people with big noses.

763
00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:58.300
Oh really?

764
00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.920
White white men with big noses.

765
00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.340
Crazy for it because it looks so different to them.

766
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:03.880
Yeah.

767
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.421
She just sort of,

768
00:21:04.421 --> 00:21:08.050
we didn't really talk English at all and we just sort of like,

769
00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:08.650
you know,

770
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:09.490
a couple of words,

771
00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:10.810
but then you got the vibe.

772
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.400
He's still a vibe there.

773
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.110
So he kind of knew.

774
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:15.550
Did you feel like you were like,

775
00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.680
like some crazy foreigner,

776
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.990
like some savage from another land?

777
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:20.853
A little bit.

778
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:22.600
Tell me more.

779
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:24.131
Well,

780
00:21:24.131 --> 00:21:24.701
that's the area,

781
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:26.470
but there's a lot of foreigners there.

782
00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.433
Right?

783
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.140
Um,

784
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.920
so they got area Lan Kwai Fong,

785
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:31.780
this guy in the Rogan board was saying,

786
00:21:31.781 --> 00:21:32.800
I should give the guy credit.

787
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.720
He was saying that,

788
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:35.583
um,

789
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.670
that these women that you'd have to tell them that you loved them.

790
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.420
Oh really?

791
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:40.721
Yeah,

792
00:21:40.721 --> 00:21:45.270
but saying that you love like saying that is different doesn't mean it's like,

793
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.050
it doesn't mean that means I love you.

794
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.741
What does it mean?

795
00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:49.240
Like what you think it means here?

796
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.440
Like people say it all.

797
00:21:50.441 --> 00:21:51.520
There were differences like that.

798
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:52.301
Yeah.

799
00:21:52.301 --> 00:21:54.880
And then he was also saying that when the breakout,

800
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:55.751
when you break up with them,

801
00:21:55.751 --> 00:21:56.650
they go fucking crazy.

802
00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:59.080
He was saying that you have,

803
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:00.670
he had a real problem with that.

804
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:02.380
You break up and they go crazy.

805
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:02.831
Yeah.

806
00:22:02.831 --> 00:22:04.600
Like suicidal or murderous.

807
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:05.583
Oh really?

808
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.790
Yeah.

809
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.580
His name is ripple.

810
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:06.971
That's there.

811
00:22:06.971 --> 00:22:08.530
The guys are very long thread.

812
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:09.140
Um,

813
00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.590
and it's on the rogue aboard.

814
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:14.770
It's actually from July 23rd of 2010.

815
00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:19.980
So it's a four year old thread and they just recently got a bumped up probably,

816
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.230
I mean maybe because of you being there.

817
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.153
Oh really?

818
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.920
That's cool.

819
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.480
Maybe,

820
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.410
maybe I'm wondering,

821
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.390
but it might just be coincidental,

822
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.830
but either way.

823
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.150
Pretty interesting shit.

824
00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:36.180
This guy talking about his experiences being a white guy in China and just

825
00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:37.630
dating chicks in heat.

826
00:22:37.631 --> 00:22:40.840
He never was into Chinese checks until he went to China.

827
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.750
And then he got like super into them.

828
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.100
I'll probably there all the time.

829
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.030
They're not fat.

830
00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.310
They're if they're all real thin,

831
00:22:48.311 --> 00:22:49.420
like I took two thin,

832
00:22:49.421 --> 00:22:51.030
almost too thin a lot of times.

833
00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:54.190
Like you've got to have some meat on your bones.

834
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:54.401
No,

835
00:22:54.401 --> 00:22:56.530
but so I would definitely no buts,

836
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:58.930
no buts were scarce.

837
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:00.430
That'd be a problem.

838
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.280
A lot of barbecue chicken clause

839
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.820
that that what he calls make tits.

840
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:11.500
He said that though the Chinese people that lived there that ate McDonald's grew

841
00:23:11.501 --> 00:23:12.130
tits.

842
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:12.820
Wow.

843
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.350
Because of all the hormones is shot into it.

844
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:15.550
Fuck.

845
00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.080
He said those were the ones.

846
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.760
It was like one of his,

847
00:23:18.761 --> 00:23:21.280
one of his things that they're out the mic.

848
00:23:21.281 --> 00:23:23.320
Tits theory be cups.

849
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.311
Ah,

850
00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:24.580
Nice.

851
00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.170
Big Up.

852
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:25.900
But you know,

853
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:26.630
nothing crazy man.

854
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.981
Tits.

855
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:27.814
That's funny.

856
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.500
Yeah.

857
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.050
And then interesting that the ones who ate a lot of Mcdonald's food.

858
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.173
Yeah.

859
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.050
So hilarious.

860
00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:36.970
It's is a mic,

861
00:23:36.971 --> 00:23:40.780
tits theory that the foreigners have formulated over their body type.

862
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.591
Wow,

863
00:23:41.591 --> 00:23:42.424
isn't that crazy?

864
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:44.350
But if they live off Mcdonald's,

865
00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.393
they have tits.

866
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.400
<v 1>But he was saying that they mistake 40 year olds for 30 year olds or younger.</v>

867
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.740
And I think I've heard some of them are like they're looking,

868
00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.340
well a lot of times they're also like um,

869
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.740
immigrant workers that when they get off they just look at a fuck.

870
00:23:57.741 --> 00:23:59.280
They're just looking to have a good time man.

871
00:23:59.281 --> 00:24:01.790
I've never seen anybody party like that on Sundays.

872
00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:06.230
They get off and they have very little rights and but Sundays you don't work and

873
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:09.410
they just fill up the markets and they all danced there all thought d like line

874
00:24:09.411 --> 00:24:11.510
dancing together by the bay.

875
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.790
Achy breaky Rankin.

876
00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:13.220
Yeah.

877
00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:13.571
All sweet.

878
00:24:13.571 --> 00:24:15.290
But like the Chinese music but absolutely.

879
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:19.280
They don't just know that there are things they party like they are free for one

880
00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:20.270
day for one day.

881
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:21.351
Wow.

882
00:24:21.351 --> 00:24:22.011
That's interesting.

883
00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:25.420
So do you think they like they're all bottled up and then they get that one job

884
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.640
so they had just enjoy your life.

885
00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.040
We're going to enjoy this.

886
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:29.480
We're going to enjoy our day off.

887
00:24:29.481 --> 00:24:30.680
No one's taking a staycation.

888
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:31.790
Let's all get out there.

889
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.080
Some comics have daisy barbecues all the time and they get super lazy.

890
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.390
Yeah,

891
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:38.330
I forget to appreciate those days off.

892
00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.193
You get used to it.

893
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.440
You Know Eddie Bravo always talks about that 80 bravo always talks about like

894
00:24:42.441 --> 00:24:44.630
learning to appreciate life like that.

895
00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:48.050
Sometimes in the middle of it it's really difficult to appreciate it and that

896
00:24:48.051 --> 00:24:50.570
you got to like force yourself to like really appreciate it.

897
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.030
Really step back and appreciate how awesome this is.

898
00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:53.210
Yeah.

899
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.410
Once in a while I'll get a new comic.

900
00:24:54.411 --> 00:24:55.244
They'll be like,

901
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.383
like,

902
00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.980
like genuinely like,

903
00:24:57.981 --> 00:24:58.131
man,

904
00:24:58.131 --> 00:25:00.500
you got your name on the wall at the comedy store.

905
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:01.791
That's so cool.

906
00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:02.360
And I'm like,

907
00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.230
Oh yeah.

908
00:25:03.231 --> 00:25:04.064
I mean I guess so.

909
00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.930
Did they take my name down?

910
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.250
No they don't.

911
00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:08.000
No,

912
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:08.900
they don't take names down.

913
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.170
They should slide names.

914
00:25:10.171 --> 00:25:11.004
You should take down.

915
00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.053
Yeah,

916
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.450
that's true.

917
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.410
It's a fun bunch of fucking names where you go.

918
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:16.400
Come on man.

919
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.410
I thought it's got his name up there.

920
00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:19.403
Fuck out of here.

921
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.140
If they would take those names down,

922
00:25:21.141 --> 00:25:22.600
I wouldn't be mad if they took mine down.

923
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:24.463
Got To get off.

924
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.500
You can take mine that while you can take my down.

925
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.780
Anybody.

926
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:28.880
But the is up at twice as he really,

927
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.550
they thought he'd slipped through the cracks and they put them up aside another

928
00:25:31.551 --> 00:25:32.840
time and then he didn't slip through the cracks.

929
00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:35.520
But that's how late they are about not taking names down because they look

930
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:36.031
twice.

931
00:25:36.031 --> 00:25:36.270
I'm like,

932
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:36.480
oh,

933
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.313
I guess it's up there.

934
00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:38.540
That's hilarious.

935
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.080
Yeah.

936
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.060
So what if someone did something terrible?

937
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.190
Like what about that comic that was like a rapist?

938
00:25:43.191 --> 00:25:44.500
Remember that comment rapist?

939
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.870
He was going to colleges and your name stays up.

940
00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:48.873
Wow.

941
00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:49.970
Is His name up there?

942
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:50.391
I don't know.

943
00:25:50.391 --> 00:25:50.691
Maybe.

944
00:25:50.691 --> 00:25:51.320
I don't know if he was,

945
00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.670
I don't think he wasn't paid regular,

946
00:25:52.671 --> 00:25:53.990
but I would have heard that if he was,

947
00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.700
somebody would have run into him.

948
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:58.940
That's it's fuck I had his name and the tips of my tongue.

949
00:25:59.120 --> 00:25:59.331
Yeah,

950
00:25:59.331 --> 00:26:00.560
that guy's in jail forever.

951
00:26:00.561 --> 00:26:01.070
Right?

952
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.010
Jail Joe from while.

953
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.170
Lot of rapes.

954
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.580
Lot of reps.

955
00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:06.470
Creepy religious shit to them.

956
00:26:06.471 --> 00:26:07.310
Like pray for me.

957
00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:08.503
Oh really?

958
00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.100
It's tell them to Vince champ.

959
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:10.700
That's it.

960
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.533
There it is.

961
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.760
Thanks.

962
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.593
Tip of tongue.

963
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:14.330
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

964
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.220
<v 1>I remember not knowing who that guy was,</v>

965
00:26:16.221 --> 00:26:18.200
but the people that did know who that guy was,

966
00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:18.470
we were like,

967
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.921
oh,

968
00:26:18.921 --> 00:26:19.754
I could see that.

969
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:20.733
I'm like,

970
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.030
oh,

971
00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:23.150
Adam Richmond just got acquitted.

972
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:24.430
Adam Richmond,

973
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:25.340
the food guy.

974
00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.253
No,

975
00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:27.680
no,

976
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.370
it's comic.

977
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:29.203
Oh my God,

978
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.790
who's an enrichment comic?

979
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.020
Scare the shit out of it.

980
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:36.710
I don't know why I'm scared of the Food Guy Getting raped or raping.

981
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:37.940
What happened?

982
00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.160
There was something in Minneapolis Ou.

983
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:40.730
Yeah,

984
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:41.131
with the weight.

985
00:26:41.131 --> 00:26:42.770
Someone accused him waitress.

986
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:43.883
Who Do you believe?

987
00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:45.800
Uh,

988
00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.200
well a lot of people find out in Richmond annoying.

989
00:26:48.201 --> 00:26:49.670
So a lot of the comic community was like,

990
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.091
I could see,

991
00:26:50.091 --> 00:26:50.421
I could see,

992
00:26:50.421 --> 00:26:50.661
I'm like,

993
00:26:50.661 --> 00:26:54.680
that's not equal to sexual assault and knowing is not the same as sexual

994
00:26:54.681 --> 00:26:55.090
assault.

995
00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:55.481
<v 0>Right.</v>

996
00:26:55.481 --> 00:26:58.300
But isn't annoying a sign of being a clueless fuck.

997
00:26:58.301 --> 00:27:02.200
And he's includes fuckers sign of being selfish and isn't being selfish to type

998
00:27:02.201 --> 00:27:02.890
of person.

999
00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:03.300
He's fun.

1000
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:03.690
Yeah.

1001
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:04.530
<v 1>He's also drunk.</v>

1002
00:27:04.531 --> 00:27:06.100
And he said he was getting aggressive to the coffee.

1003
00:27:06.101 --> 00:27:08.340
He said it was getting a little aggressive and then they have like some nine on

1004
00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:09.210
one foot,

1005
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:09.910

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:10.710

1010
00:27:13.771 --> 00:27:14.604

1011
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.473
We'll get outta here

<v 0>but acquitted.</v>

1013
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:20.410
Wow.

1014
00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:21.340
And what did he do?

1015
00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:21.611
Well,

1016
00:27:21.611 --> 00:27:22.310
who cares?

1017
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.740
What do we fucking TMZ.

1018
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.220
Yeah,

1019
00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.470
but you know what man,

1020
00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:29.380
there's a real problem when you have sexual urges.

1021
00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:30.010
Yeah.

1022
00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:31.420
Idiots and alcohol,

1023
00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:33.140
all those things together as two,

1024
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.840
it adds to it.

1025
00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.490
But also being an idiot,

1026
00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.500
you know you're not a sexual assaulter.

1027
00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:39.613
Yeah.

1028
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:40.640
You know,

1029
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.180
you wouldn't hold someone down and do something creepy to them if you were

1030
00:27:43.181 --> 00:27:44.014
drunk.

1031
00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.910
<v 1>What time is John coming out with Amy curfew in college as a friend.</v>

1032
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.140
You're just kissing and stuff.

1033
00:27:48.141 --> 00:27:48.441
And I was like,

1034
00:27:48.441 --> 00:27:50.090
come on and try and get in her pants and she goes,

1035
00:27:50.091 --> 00:27:50.451
no,

1036
00:27:50.451 --> 00:27:51.020
no,

1037
00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.460
like kissing was as far as it was going to go.

1038
00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:53.090
Right.

1039
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:53.811
And the other come on,

1040
00:27:53.811 --> 00:27:54.021
she's like,

1041
00:27:54.021 --> 00:27:54.441
no,

1042
00:27:54.441 --> 00:27:54.681
no,

1043
00:27:54.681 --> 00:27:54.981
come on,

1044
00:27:54.981 --> 00:27:55.814
stop.

1045
00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:56.630
Um,

1046
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.790
and then I got up to like as a joke to like lock the door.

1047
00:27:58.791 --> 00:27:59.001
Like,

1048
00:27:59.001 --> 00:27:59.180
hey,

1049
00:27:59.180 --> 00:27:59.750
lock the door.

1050
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:00.583
We're doing this.

1051
00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:01.371
And then as soon as I like to do,

1052
00:28:01.371 --> 00:28:02.111
I took one step back.

1053
00:28:02.111 --> 00:28:02.450
I'm like,

1054
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.571
oh,

1055
00:28:02.571 --> 00:28:04.910
this seems like a door opened it up.

1056
00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:05.580
This seems right.

1057
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.111
<v 0>This is weird.</v>

1058
00:28:06.111 --> 00:28:06.240
Why?

1059
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.073
It's not even funny.

1060
00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:08.190
It's like,

1061
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:09.023
yeah,

1062
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:12.210
but we've all been in that situation where it girls like,

1063
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:12.631
no,

1064
00:28:12.631 --> 00:28:12.960
and you're like,

1065
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.100
please,

1066
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:15.983
please.

1067
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:16.650
Yeah,

1068
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:17.760
but doesn't work sometimes.

1069
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:20.340
Some guys are assholes.

1070
00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.131
<v 1>What do you mean it doesn't work?</v>

1071
00:28:21.131 --> 00:28:22.970
Sometimes it never works to beg for policy.

1072
00:28:22.971 --> 00:28:23.804
Sometimes does.

1073
00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:24.221
Oh,

1074
00:28:24.221 --> 00:28:25.054
and they just give it negative.

1075
00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.300
I've ever heard of the [inaudible] time when a girl says,

1076
00:28:28.301 --> 00:28:29.050
okay,

1077
00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:29.883
Oh yeah,

1078
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.010
finally you can stop fighting.

1079
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:34.720
Okay,

1080
00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.590
but only put it on my ass.

1081
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:41.620
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1082
00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.170
but you add like idiocy,

1083
00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:48.310
sexual urges and alcohol is a fucking terrible,

1084
00:28:48.311 --> 00:28:48.731
terrible,

1085
00:28:48.731 --> 00:28:49.800
terrible combination.

1086
00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:50.741
But it's everywhere.

1087
00:28:50.741 --> 00:28:52.300
That's the weirdest thing about people.

1088
00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:57.370
He's like the worst combination of drugs to dating is what you get.

1089
00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.121
I mean,

1090
00:28:58.121 --> 00:29:00.070
good in that it's a social lubricant.

1091
00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:01.300
People relax,

1092
00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.221
have a couple of drinks.

1093
00:29:02.221 --> 00:29:03.460
It loosens up the vibe.

1094
00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:08.290
You might get a little loose and silly and have fun and be more,

1095
00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:09.880
more likely to fool around,

1096
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.130
but you know,

1097
00:29:12.131 --> 00:29:14.920
at a certain point you've got to realize that that's not everybody's,

1098
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.600
like we were talking about earlier in the podcast,

1099
00:29:16.601 --> 00:29:19.060
that I don't know what happens to some people when they drink,

1100
00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:19.983
but I've seen it.

1101
00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:20.831
Yeah,

1102
00:29:20.831 --> 00:29:21.550
you see you see it.

1103
00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:22.090
Yeah.

1104
00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.520
You seen that switch that goes off and they're not there anymore.

1105
00:29:24.521 --> 00:29:25.211
It's not you.

1106
00:29:25.211 --> 00:29:25.901
You don't do that.

1107
00:29:25.901 --> 00:29:26.710
I don't do that.

1108
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.630
But we all know guys who do do that.

1109
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:30.890
One of them's got a portrait in the bathroom mirror.

1110
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.380
It's one out of 10 you know,

1111
00:29:32.381 --> 00:29:33.214
whatever it is.

1112
00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.470
When you see that man,

1113
00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:40.000
you know that that guy shouldn't be drinking shoes around women if he has a

1114
00:29:40.001 --> 00:29:40.631
sexual urge.

1115
00:29:40.631 --> 00:29:42.190
Cause it's just going to be a disaster.

1116
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.063
Yeah,

1117
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.010
but that's the drug of choice.

1118
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:45.940
That's what you get.

1119
00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:46.810
You could go to a bar,

1120
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:47.710
you don't get an option.

1121
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.530
You can take ecstasy.

1122
00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.010
Yeah.

1123
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:51.790
Fuck Yak.

1124
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:52.960
You imagine being a chick and dude,

1125
00:29:52.961 --> 00:29:54.010
you're trying to drug you.

1126
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:55.060
Oh,

1127
00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.370
how many girls have you talked to that had been roofied Oh,

1128
00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:58.700
a lot right now.

1129
00:29:58.770 --> 00:29:59.890
All the ones I hung out with,

1130
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.713
I don't know

1131
00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.150
all the ones I roofie but that doesn't count.

1132
00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.050
Just fucking bitches had a coffee drink it.

1133
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.620
So you know,

1134
00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.630
the stats are all skewed.

1135
00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:13.780
It wasn't bill Cosby in trouble for some shit like that.

1136
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.793
Really?

1137
00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.720
No doctor Cosby,

1138
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:17.861
Bill Cosby.

1139
00:30:17.861 --> 00:30:18.641
Second only to Martin.

1140
00:30:18.641 --> 00:30:20.140
To the king and important black men.

1141
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:22.360
Not really bill Cosby.

1142
00:30:22.361 --> 00:30:24.100
Sexual assault allegations.

1143
00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:25.420
Um,

1144
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:25.691
uh,

1145
00:30:25.691 --> 00:30:27.580
why isn't anyone,

1146
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.540
why doesn't anyone care about the sexual assault allegations against bill Cosby

1147
00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:34.570
allegations that people agree that like once a month famous enough,

1148
00:30:34.571 --> 00:30:35.440
we're just not going to care.

1149
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:36.573
Yeah,

1150
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.600
I don't know man.

1151
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:39.101
I mean,

1152
00:30:39.101 --> 00:30:40.180
who the fuck knows it's true.

1153
00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.040
It also could be just,

1154
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.880
you know,

1155
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.180
it's,

1156
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.180
who knows the girl,

1157
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:48.010
the comedy store claim somebody raped her and one of the door guys and we've got

1158
00:30:48.011 --> 00:30:50.210
really weird for a while cause you don't really know who to believe.

1159
00:30:50.211 --> 00:30:51.790
But at the same time it's like this is bad.

1160
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.590
You're not gonna come out vehemently on,

1161
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:54.790
I'm inside of the door guy.

1162
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:55.541
You know,

1163
00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:56.021
you might be like,

1164
00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:57.010
I'm not gonna get involved.

1165
00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.900
And then a few months later she accused someone else or raping her.

1166
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.640
Uh,

1167
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.910
and then like eight months after that she accused the third person and

1168
00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:06.130
everything.

1169
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:06.371
I was like,

1170
00:31:06.371 --> 00:31:08.620
why do you keep hanging out at the rape house?

1171
00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:12.070
I'm starting to believe that maybe there's none of this happened.

1172
00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.413
Yeah.

1173
00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:15.220
Well that was,

1174
00:31:15.221 --> 00:31:15.820
um,

1175
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:16.270
the guy,

1176
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.160
the girl who claimed that Mike Tyson raped her.

1177
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.730
Yeah.

1178
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:23.410
She had made a false allegation or she was 18 about another guy.

1179
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.190
I feel like,

1180
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.350
I think either through it Mike Michael Tyson was,

1181
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.930
that wasn't a good conviction.

1182
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:30.250
Um,

1183
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.350
he probably did a bunch of bad shit,

1184
00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.210
but in that situation,

1185
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.480
yeah,

1186
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.110
it seems like that girl went back up to his room wanting to fuck.

1187
00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:39.910
She took her panty liner off.

1188
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.110
I don't know what happened.

1189
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.270
I don't want to speculate because I wasn't there.

1190
00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:44.920
You know what the fuck knows?

1191
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.410
But there's a lot of shit going on when,

1192
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.140
when you have someone who's got a false allegation,

1193
00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.390
it's like the problem is do players,

1194
00:31:52.391 --> 00:31:53.770
they all lost their seats worse.

1195
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:58.480
It's way worse to rape someone than it is to falsely accuse someone of rape.

1196
00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.500
In my opinion,

1197
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.980
it's worse because the rape is a violent crime,

1198
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.480
falsely accusing someone of rape,

1199
00:32:04.481 --> 00:32:09.481
although horrific in my id and my hierarchy of crimes is slightly lower.

1200
00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.760
What if the same amount of violence happened to you because of Dan?

1201
00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.750
It's the same crime.

1202
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.650
Like if you go to jail and then guys rape you because you with the punishment

1203
00:32:17.651 --> 00:32:18.560
for rape is,

1204
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.050
is it just the punishment?

1205
00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:20.651
If it's like,

1206
00:32:20.651 --> 00:32:20.861
okay,

1207
00:32:20.861 --> 00:32:21.694
that's about right.

1208
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:22.001
You know,

1209
00:32:22.001 --> 00:32:23.920
like the eight months of his personality and like that's too,

1210
00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:24.813
that's too much.

1211
00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.181
Whoa,

1212
00:32:25.181 --> 00:32:25.421
whoa.

1213
00:32:25.421 --> 00:32:25.811
Hold on,

1214
00:32:25.811 --> 00:32:26.081
hold on,

1215
00:32:26.081 --> 00:32:26.411
hold on.

1216
00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:27.244
Hold on.

1217
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.550
13 women said Kylie,

1218
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:31.000
she's bill Cosby drugging them

1219
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.593
with what?

1220
00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:35.723
Um,

1221
00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:38.533
Jello.

1222
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:40.130
Oh

1223
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.970
<v 1>my God.</v>

1224
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:41.871
13.

1225
00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:42.704
That's a lot.

1226
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:43.730
This is insane.

1227
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:45.501
Where there's smoke,

1228
00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:46.850
there's 13 fires.

1229
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:47.713
Wow,

1230
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.633
that's amazing.

1231
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.513
That's a lot.

1232
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:51.050
Yeah.

1233
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:52.730
I mean who knows what the fuck happened,

1234
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:53.690
but uh,

1235
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:54.681
you know,

1236
00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:56.240
and I don't want to be callous about it.

1237
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:56.961
I'm not,

1238
00:32:56.961 --> 00:32:57.741
I'm just saying who knows,

1239
00:32:57.741 --> 00:32:58.574
cause I don't know,

1240
00:32:58.790 --> 00:32:59.810
but I don't look good.

1241
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.460
Be Callin about it.

1242
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:02.783
Brian.

1243
00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:04.850
Cosby's cock.

1244
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:05.550
Cause listen,

1245
00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:08.840
understand seemed in the sun hawks with land on it,

1246
00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:10.740
you know,

1247
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.800
he makes its own Ruthie's,

1248
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.410
you don't even understand it.

1249
00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.260
They weren't drugged.

1250
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:16.730
They were fuck to sleep.

1251
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.630
You're big calendar about it.

1252
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.473
Catlin.

1253
00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:22.893
I like that.

1254
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:23.771
That's a dude's there,

1255
00:33:23.771 --> 00:33:24.030
right?

1256
00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:24.863
Yeah.

1257
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.640
Joey keys would probably say a similar thing.

1258
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.130
Bill Cosby drugging and those bitches,

1259
00:33:31.131 --> 00:33:33.770
he just gives him that sweet thick candy,

1260
00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:35.240
Jello Pudding Cup and pop.

1261
00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.370
Uh,

1262
00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.180
that's not a good amount of,

1263
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:39.170
that's not a good number.

1264
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.640
I almost saw him recently.

1265
00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:41.680
I went really?

1266
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:41.900
Yeah.

1267
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:42.410
They were telling.

1268
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:43.430
Everybody keeps telling me,

1269
00:33:43.431 --> 00:33:44.420
you gotta go see him live.

1270
00:33:44.421 --> 00:33:45.260
You've got to go see him live.

1271
00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:46.670
It'd be their first experience of like,

1272
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.300
it was a fun childhood.

1273
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:52.190
Like well also they say it's really good people shitting on a special and people

1274
00:33:52.191 --> 00:33:52.311
are like,

1275
00:33:52.311 --> 00:33:52.781
how can you show it?

1276
00:33:52.781 --> 00:33:53.571
Especially as legend.

1277
00:33:53.571 --> 00:33:54.890
Like cause we're not shitting on his,

1278
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.170
on his legacy was shitting on this one special.

1279
00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.260
That's how you can say everything he does is good now.

1280
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.360
He's definitely a good,

1281
00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.000
he's definitely a great artist.

1282
00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.130
As far as like his,

1283
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.260
the bulk of his stand up comedy history.

1284
00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:11.090
He's a million right now.

1285
00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:11.781
Great guys.

1286
00:34:11.781 --> 00:34:12.980
He's not perfect.

1287
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:13.641
He's a great,

1288
00:34:13.641 --> 00:34:15.680
great comedian for the longest time.

1289
00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:16.723
Yeah.

1290
00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.910
I didn't watch his new one that I watched a little bit of it on comedy central

1291
00:34:19.911 --> 00:34:21.500
and I never got a chance to see in Vegas.

1292
00:34:21.501 --> 00:34:22.970
I was with too many people too scared.

1293
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:25.130
Scared to go see it live.

1294
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:27.800
To know to watch the camera central thing because you'd hate it.

1295
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.850
I got enough respect for him.

1296
00:34:28.851 --> 00:34:29.650
I don't need to wash it.

1297
00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:30.020
Yeah.

1298
00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.870
But do you have more or less respect for him if he drug 14 chicks,

1299
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.473
that seems,

1300
00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.090
that seems like if it's special sucks,

1301
00:34:38.091 --> 00:34:39.470
that's not nearly as disappointing.

1302
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.050
It's like you gotta be more honest on stage if that's what you're gonna really

1303
00:34:42.051 --> 00:34:42.440
do.

1304
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.180
You got to deal with that from your act.

1305
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:45.380
Could you imagine if like,

1306
00:34:45.381 --> 00:34:47.950
he's like the squeaky clean guy,

1307
00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.650
but really just dirty in life.

1308
00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:52.770
It's rugging chicks and like that prices.

1309
00:34:52.771 --> 00:34:52.921
Right.

1310
00:34:52.921 --> 00:34:53.081
Right.

1311
00:34:53.081 --> 00:34:53.914
And that price is right.

1312
00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:55.970
We'll show is that family feud?

1313
00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.393
What did he do?

1314
00:34:59.060 --> 00:34:59.990
The height cameras.

1315
00:34:59.991 --> 00:35:00.950
Wasn't that movie height?

1316
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.761
Oh,

1317
00:35:01.761 --> 00:35:01.981
no,

1318
00:35:01.981 --> 00:35:02.221
no,

1319
00:35:02.221 --> 00:35:02.410
no,

1320
00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:02.651
no,

1321
00:35:02.651 --> 00:35:02.751
no.

1322
00:35:02.751 --> 00:35:03.710
Hogan's heroes.

1323
00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:04.040
Yeah,

1324
00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:04.590
yeah,

1325
00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:04.940
yeah,

1326
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:05.211
yeah,

1327
00:35:05.211 --> 00:35:05.511
yeah.

1328
00:35:05.511 --> 00:35:08.930
The other guy who is on the hug and tears was the host of family feud went on

1329
00:35:08.931 --> 00:35:09.151
to,

1330
00:35:09.151 --> 00:35:09.984
I remember

1331
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:12.650
the British combs.

1332
00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:13.290
Yeah.

1333
00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:13.461
No,

1334
00:35:13.461 --> 00:35:13.521
no,

1335
00:35:13.521 --> 00:35:14.360
no before him.

1336
00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:14.541
Oh,

1337
00:35:14.541 --> 00:35:14.841
really?

1338
00:35:14.841 --> 00:35:15.320
Shy.

1339
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.153
Yeah.

1340
00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:17.630
I don't remember.

1341
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:18.021
Oh yeah,

1342
00:35:18.021 --> 00:35:18.830
I remember that guy.

1343
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:19.670
The original guy?

1344
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:20.420
Yeah.

1345
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.470
He was the original guy.

1346
00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.101
Yeah.

1347
00:35:22.101 --> 00:35:22.660
I don't know.

1348
00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:23.493
Yeah.

1349
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:25.190
Who the fuck was his name is?

1350
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:26.581
What was that dude's name?

1351
00:35:26.581 --> 00:35:27.414
Jamie.

1352
00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:28.640
Awesome.

1353
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.473
Richard Dawson.

1354
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.120
Dawson would always kiss the luck and ladies.

1355
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.820
Yeah,

1356
00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:34.340
I remember he was in Hogan's heroes.

1357
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.660
That's why cause ladies,

1358
00:35:35.661 --> 00:35:37.070
because he was selfish to fucking horn.

1359
00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.110
They were just fi's evidence from our movie.

1360
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.153
That's him.

1361
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.990
That's him.

1362
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.360
Yeah.

1363
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.200
Richard Dawson.

1364
00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.470
So he's a British POW.

1365
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.393
Yeah,

1366
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:48.210

1367
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:51.030
Look at him slinging Dick would that fucking beautiful vest on.

1368
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:52.860
I got a suit made with a three piece.

1369
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:53.641

1370
00:35:53.641 --> 00:35:54.110

1371
00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:54.960

I retweeted you a Po.

1375
00:35:57.691 --> 00:35:58.740
Bruce Lee won the day.

1376
00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:00.300
That one got the most like favorites.

1377
00:36:00.301 --> 00:36:01.980
I've ever gotten through to that.

1378
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:03.360
What were you doing to his dick?

1379
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:05.880
And it was like the rod and I just like angled it.

1380
00:36:05.881 --> 00:36:08.820
So I was like right in his dick that's in Hong Kong.

1381
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.713
That was in Hong Kong.

1382
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:10.170
He's,

1383
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.970
he liked the biggest star to ever come out of Hong Kong International,

1384
00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:16.140
I believe so managing the other Chinese dudes like,

1385
00:36:16.141 --> 00:36:17.810
what the fuck do I have to do?

1386
00:36:17.811 --> 00:36:21.180
This doesn't make any sense to guys ever jet Li and him.

1387
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:22.043
That's it.

1388
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:22.913
That's it.

1389
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:24.090
Oh Jackie Chan,

1390
00:36:24.091 --> 00:36:24.571
whatever.

1391
00:36:24.571 --> 00:36:25.220
Three guys.

1392
00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:25.651
And one guy was like,

1393
00:36:25.651 --> 00:36:26.790
I invented tables.

1394
00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.090
I can't get a fucking footnote.

1395
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:32.760
Oh look at you balling.

1396
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.050
It was because he's made it.

1397
00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:35.190
How long did that take?

1398
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:38.190
Either go once they've measured you pick out a fabric.

1399
00:36:38.191 --> 00:36:38.970
They measure you.

1400
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:39.840
Rhodes told me about it.

1401
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:40.441
They love him.

1402
00:36:40.441 --> 00:36:41.490

1418

on Taylor and for like 45 years he had to pick out a fabric.

1419
00:37:04.231 --> 00:37:07.710
They measure you and then you come back the next day to like to like measure on

1420
00:37:07.711 --> 00:37:08.200

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.153
pick up a suit.

1424
00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:13.950
That's what they did for me for the UFC.

1425
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.890
All of you'll find like told you like we're going to do this for you.

1426
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:17.290
Yeah,

1427
00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:18.990
they gave up on me handmade suit.

1428
00:37:18.991 --> 00:37:19.540
They just made it for,

1429
00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:19.800
yeah.

1430
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.170
Great.

1431
00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:20.451
Thank you.

1432
00:37:20.451 --> 00:37:21.570
It won't fit better than that.

1433
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:23.580
It's Kinda tight.

1434
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:24.773
It is.

1435
00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.440
Yeah.

1436
00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.520
I stopped wearing the jacket.

1437
00:37:26.521 --> 00:37:27.480
The jacket is too much.

1438
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:28.801
I'm just a,

1439
00:37:28.801 --> 00:37:32.390
they don't make them for chimpanzees and make them for regular people and get it

1440
00:37:32.391 --> 00:37:35.170
made for your fucking garbage.

1441
00:37:35.171 --> 00:37:36.570
Cam does a body type.

1442
00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:39.083
It doesn't work.

1443
00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:39.631
It doesn't.

1444
00:37:39.631 --> 00:37:40.560
The jacket doesn't work.

1445
00:37:40.561 --> 00:37:41.520
The close work fine.

1446
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.630
Although they're a little tight.

1447
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:43.321
It's weird.

1448
00:37:43.321 --> 00:37:45.720
It's like a stretchy fabric so it doesn't feel bad that it's tight.

1449
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:46.150
Yeah.

1450
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.983
Moves real good.

1451
00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:48.480
But you know,

1452
00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:53.400
it's like there's like a slim look that people wearing these days.

1453
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:58.640
Slim Trim and sort of passels people like in like the lower east side where I'm

1454
00:37:58.651 --> 00:37:58.760

1455
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.030
God damn you look good.

1456
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.440
It's like a one button and like fuck.

1457
00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:04.360
Yeah man.

1458
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.520
Like fucking cool suits.

1459
00:38:05.521 --> 00:38:06.354

1460
00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:07.363

1461
00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:07.830
chicks,

1462
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.600
that shit walking around those stupid shoes on.

1463
00:38:09.601 --> 00:38:10.110
They like that.

1464
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:10.531
Oh yeah,

1465
00:38:10.531 --> 00:38:11.430
the stupid shoes.

1466
00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:11.970
Slippery,

1467
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:12.481
uncomfortable,

1468
00:38:12.481 --> 00:38:13.314
slippery shoes.

1469
00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:14.430
This is so ridiculous.

1470
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.540
They tried to get me to where those,

1471
00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.321
the slipper shoes.

1472
00:38:16.321 --> 00:38:16.591
I'm like,

1473
00:38:16.591 --> 00:38:16.960
bitch,

1474
00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.270
why you never been filmed my feet?

1475
00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:19.111
I should wear sneakers.

1476
00:38:19.111 --> 00:38:19.771
He's wear ratty.

1477
00:38:19.771 --> 00:38:21.750
Chuck Taylor's good move shit.

1478
00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.370
But occasionally to see my feet.

1479
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.810
So how you do that with bottom up?

1480
00:38:25.811 --> 00:38:26.820
Like I'm trying too hard.

1481
00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.390
Oh yeah.

1482
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:30.300
You know like if you're a comedian you wear chuck Taylors with a nice suit.

1483
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:31.763
Jordan Ruben.

1484
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:33.390
But it's like you're being a comedian,

1485
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:34.610
you're trying too hard.

1486
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:34.891
You're like,

1487
00:38:34.891 --> 00:38:35.140
look,

1488
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.060
I'm wacky.

1489
00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.110
<v 0>I'm a wacky guy.</v>

1490
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.520
I had a meeting with a dude once.

1491
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:40.630
There was a time,

1492
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.800
I don't know if I told you the story.

1493
00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.340
This is a time where they were giving out development deals,

1494
00:38:45.341 --> 00:38:46.970
like fucking crazy,

1495
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:47.860
left and right.

1496
00:38:47.861 --> 00:38:48.940
Mad Money,

1497
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:52.690
mad money for comedians and more importantly for writers.

1498
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.700
And this one guy was a writer,

1499
00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.380
he was a writer on like friends and he got a crazy deal,

1500
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:00.130
a crazy,

1501
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:00.990
and it was like,

1502
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:04.360
I think it was Michael Eisner's company and we're going to add some comp company

1503
00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.280
and an office and they say,

1504
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:07.421
we got you for two years.

1505
00:39:07.421 --> 00:39:08.051
Give us some ideas.

1506
00:39:08.051 --> 00:39:08.320
Yeah.

1507
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.530
And so I had a development deal with Fox at the time,

1508
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.150
so they wanted me to meet with this cat.

1509
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.871
So a,

1510
00:39:13.871 --> 00:39:15.010
I met with this guy to,

1511
00:39:15.011 --> 00:39:15.191
uh,

1512
00:39:15.191 --> 00:39:16.090
work on a sitcom.

1513
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.670
This is post news radio right after news radio ended,

1514
00:39:18.671 --> 00:39:20.110
I got this development deal done with us.

1515
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.040
You got to tell another story.

1516
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.390
So I go tell another story.

1517
00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:22.930
Yeah.

1518
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:23.500
Okay.

1519
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.980
You gotta tell me what it is you're writing down.

1520
00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:25.730
Okay.

1521
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.130
So I go,

1522
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.983
um,

1523
00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:29.523
freaked me out.

1524
00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:30.873
What was I talking about?

1525
00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.950
It's got this development too.

1526
00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:33.370
Oh yeah.

1527
00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:33.611
Okay.

1528
00:39:33.611 --> 00:39:34.660
So I go in this guy's office,

1529
00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:35.993
um,

1530
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.080
and they gave him this giant fucking development dealer.

1531
00:39:38.081 --> 00:39:39.190
Tell me how amazing he is.

1532
00:39:39.191 --> 00:39:40.450
One of the writers on friends guys.

1533
00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:40.940
Incredible.

1534
00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:44.830
It turns out he was actually a partner of a funny guy and he was the guy who

1535
00:39:44.831 --> 00:39:49.180
would write shit down and they're just like a two guy team and this guy got a

1536
00:39:49.181 --> 00:39:52.720
development deal but he was horrible.

1537
00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:57.200
So I go in to meet with him and he's wearing bowling shoes and I looked down and

1538
00:39:57.201 --> 00:39:58.480
I see those bowling shoes.

1539
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:59.623
Why does that work?

1540
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:03.370
Oh he's a wacky guy who wears bowling shoes cause he's silly,

1541
00:40:03.371 --> 00:40:04.204
don't you get it?

1542
00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:09.100
So this guy is like talking to me about plot and this and that and I'm looking

1543
00:40:09.101 --> 00:40:09.934
at his bowling shoes.

1544
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:11.500
You silly silly mother.

1545
00:40:11.501 --> 00:40:12.340
And I got out of there,

1546
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:13.910
Sussman said the same thing to me.

1547
00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:14.081
He goes,

1548
00:40:14.081 --> 00:40:14.914
you see a serious,

1549
00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.230
I was just wearing bowling shows and I go,

1550
00:40:17.231 --> 00:40:17.351
yeah,

1551
00:40:17.351 --> 00:40:17.891
what's up with that?

1552
00:40:17.891 --> 00:40:18.191
And he goes,

1553
00:40:18.191 --> 00:40:18.371
he's,

1554
00:40:18.371 --> 00:40:20.140
he's trying to once you to think he's wacky.

1555
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.970
Oh like who likes wacky crystal bumble,

1556
00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:23.813
wacky guy.

1557
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:26.320
Cause he was thinking like that's how you become a funny guy.

1558
00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.850
You've got to walk around with bowling shoes on.

1559
00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:31.310
The script that he wrote was such a massive hunk of shit.

1560
00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:36.660
Oh essentially it was about an immortal guy and the mortal guy who bang chicks,

1561
00:40:37.031 --> 00:40:37.131
he,

1562
00:40:37.131 --> 00:40:40.780
he like got cursed in Egypt and bank checks through the end of time,

1563
00:40:40.781 --> 00:40:43.750
like t to the future and had all these sexual dilemmas.

1564
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:44.583
It was like weird.

1565
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.120
It was so bad.

1566
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:46.931
It was so,

1567
00:40:46.931 --> 00:40:48.160
it didn't make any sense.

1568
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:49.540
It was like you would read it and you would go,

1569
00:40:49.541 --> 00:40:51.100
who could have thought this was funny.

1570
00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.180
I was in the office with the Fox people when they brought it to me and you know

1571
00:40:55.181 --> 00:40:55.811
they have this like,

1572
00:40:55.811 --> 00:40:56.381
did you like,

1573
00:40:56.381 --> 00:40:56.960
did you read it?

1574
00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.880
And so we have this meeting.

1575
00:40:57.881 --> 00:40:58.121
I go,

1576
00:40:58.121 --> 00:40:58.810
yeah,

1577
00:40:58.810 --> 00:40:59.643
did you read it?

1578
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:00.460
Oh yeah,

1579
00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:00.671
I go,

1580
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:01.630
I fucking told you.

1581
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.650
I like I told you.

1582
00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:03.521
And they're like,

1583
00:41:03.521 --> 00:41:05.350
well I mean it's important what?

1584
00:41:05.351 --> 00:41:06.610
He's really good at his story structure.

1585
00:41:06.611 --> 00:41:06.761
I go,

1586
00:41:06.761 --> 00:41:08.650
what the fuck do you mean by that?

1587
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.060
You just said nonsense.

1588
00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:10.301
What?

1589
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:11.740
He's really good as story structure.

1590
00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:16.450
The idea is that like maybe you comedians know how to make things laugh,

1591
00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:17.500
make people laugh.

1592
00:41:17.501 --> 00:41:19.810
But what you don't know is how to structure a story.

1593
00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.350
Like nobody really cares about the structure and the story when they say stuff

1594
00:41:23.351 --> 00:41:23.831
like that.

1595
00:41:23.831 --> 00:41:24.970
Like story structure.

1596
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.320
You know what they did just sing words

1597
00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:28.510
mean.

1598
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:30.070
So I'll just say it through an argue with me.

1599
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:34.010
Well there's guys who know how to write movies or books that are really

1600
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.221
<v 1>good.</v>

1601
00:41:34.221 --> 00:41:35.640
Good story structure.

1602
00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:35.920
Cash,

1603
00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.111
right?

1604
00:41:36.111 --> 00:41:36.850
24.

1605
00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:37.220
Yeah.

1606
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.150
That's hardest shit.

1607
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:39.043
Hardest Shit.

1608
00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:41.090
Really good at structuring stories.

1609
00:41:41.091 --> 00:41:42.290
He spent a ton of time on it,

1610
00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:47.980
but a sick comments about being funny stories are important but funny stories or

1611
00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.900
like Larry David was the master of that,

1612
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:51.650
you know,

1613
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:52.483
cause he would,

1614
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.550
you knew how to make a funny third through line.

1615
00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:56.330
It's funny though.

1616
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:58.490
The idea at itself,

1617
00:41:59.000 --> 00:41:59.631
he's hilarious.

1618
00:41:59.631 --> 00:41:59.761
Yeah,

1619
00:41:59.761 --> 00:42:00.560
exactly.

1620
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.130
Yeah.

1621
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:02.360
I want to follow audition for some,

1622
00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:05.900
for some part I told you this but I read it,

1623
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:06.740
you know,

1624
00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:09.510
some best friend character and a,

1625
00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.790
the casting director was like,

1626
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.653
um,

1627
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:12.650
okay.

1628
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:13.483
Uh,

1629
00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:14.420
I was good.

1630
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.253
My only note,

1631
00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.350
you didn't do any of the lines.

1632
00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.453
You told me this.

1633
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:20.811
I was like,

1634
00:42:20.811 --> 00:42:21.111
Oh yeah,

1635
00:42:21.111 --> 00:42:21.471
the blinds,

1636
00:42:21.471 --> 00:42:21.831
it's terrible.

1637
00:42:21.831 --> 00:42:22.101
I can't,

1638
00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:22.851
I cannot do those.

1639
00:42:22.851 --> 00:42:24.350
I was supposed to go off of that same role.

1640
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:25.520
That's hilarious.

1641
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.360
I read it and I was like,

1642
00:42:26.361 --> 00:42:27.470
get the fuck Outta here.

1643
00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:30.320
They're making a big push through the comedian community.

1644
00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.750
I got to me and I was like,

1645
00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:33.381
cause I'm not,

1646
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:34.610
I'm not completely out of the loop.

1647
00:42:34.611 --> 00:42:36.250
I don't audition for things,

1648
00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.580
I don't want to act.

1649
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:38.620
I don't have any desires.

1650
00:42:38.621 --> 00:42:39.381
So when it comes to me,

1651
00:42:39.381 --> 00:42:41.030
it's coming to me completely out of the blue.

1652
00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:41.690
Like I don't know,

1653
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:43.100
I don't put myself out in that world.

1654
00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.410
The only person I've ever acted with is Kevin James.

1655
00:42:45.411 --> 00:42:48.440
Cause we're friends in the last decade plus.

1656
00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:49.820
So I was like,

1657
00:42:49.821 --> 00:42:50.900
well maybe it's just really good.

1658
00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:52.821
You read it.

1659
00:42:52.821 --> 00:42:53.720
It's like I ain't could.

1660
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:55.220
And then I heard what you did and I was like,

1661
00:42:55.221 --> 00:42:55.630
that's,

1662
00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:56.510
that's how they handle it.

1663
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:59.090
I said yes before I read it.

1664
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.920
So now kind of fuck around.

1665
00:43:00.921 --> 00:43:02.450
How fun or so I just not go like,

1666
00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.410
why do you want me to handle it?

1667
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:04.730
I don't want to get you in trouble with the cousin Garth.

1668
00:43:04.731 --> 00:43:05.151
And she goes,

1669
00:43:05.151 --> 00:43:05.430
Ari,

1670
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:07.100
I'm never going to tell you not to do what you want to do.

1671
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.053
Wow.

1672
00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.070
It's good agent.

1673
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:11.241
Yeah,

1674
00:43:11.241 --> 00:43:13.280
but that's how they make a piece of Shit Sitcom near.

1675
00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.590
Just wonder how you took a funny guy.

1676
00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.100
Make a fucking terrible sitcom with them.

1677
00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.750
So I'll come up with some shitty writer who just whips it out in a week.

1678
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.780
It doesn't care about it at all.

1679
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:23.540
Some dickhead wearing bowling shoes thinking is wacky.

1680
00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:24.963
Oh

1681
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.020
well that's the beautiful thing about being a comic,

1682
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:33.500
about detaching yourself from that ridiculous system.

1683
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:38.270
Like for the longest time we were all taught that we had to get a sitcom.

1684
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:39.860
You what you want to do to get a second.

1685
00:43:39.861 --> 00:43:42.050
I mean I have to go to put together an act,

1686
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.221
get,

1687
00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:44.380
get your seven minutes.

1688
00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:45.500
I just want to go on the road.

1689
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.360
Just that's the only way you're gonna go on the road and have a draw.

1690
00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.140
Put a,

1691
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.010
put a say come together.

1692
00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.301
That was the thing,

1693
00:43:50.301 --> 00:43:50.570
man,

1694
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:51.061
that's what we owe.

1695
00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:53.810
We always were taught that and then suddenly you're like,

1696
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:56.510
I just lost faith in television.

1697
00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.310
Like I stopped even caring.

1698
00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:00.170
It was like a girl you're trying to fuck all the time.

1699
00:44:00.171 --> 00:44:01.640
She doesn't want to fuck you after a,

1700
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:03.110
it's like I'm not even mad at you.

1701
00:44:03.111 --> 00:44:03.500
I just,

1702
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.190
you're irrelevant.

1703
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:05.360
I just stopped thinking about you.

1704
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:05.811
Well,

1705
00:44:05.811 --> 00:44:06.680
one thing that I,

1706
00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:08.780
oh Dane Cook yeah,

1707
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:13.810
for sure is that Dane Cook inspired me to use social media more do this without,

1708
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:17.270
without the TV that the approval of some guy.

1709
00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:17.691
Well,

1710
00:44:17.691 --> 00:44:19.320
he inspired me to um,

1711
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:23.030
to use like social media in a promotion where I never used it before,

1712
00:44:23.031 --> 00:44:24.470
but I saw the results that he got,

1713
00:44:24.471 --> 00:44:26.090
which were insanely good.

1714
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.540
My space mean he got results from performances for sure,

1715
00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:31.130
but he also got results.

1716
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.130
The fact that

1717
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.420
<v 0>he had so many myspace friends,</v>

1718
00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:37.290
he capitalizes on those results of the shows that capitalize so hard on them.

1719
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:38.280
Yeah.

1720
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.113
Fascinating.

1721
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:40.140
Completely fascinating.

1722
00:44:40.141 --> 00:44:42.270
So that got me really into my space,

1723
00:44:42.271 --> 00:44:43.920
which got me really into Twitter,

1724
00:44:43.921 --> 00:44:44.700
which got me,

1725
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.020
I'd always had a message board.

1726
00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.810
But that's also when Brian and I started working together and he started

1727
00:44:48.811 --> 00:44:51.840
creating videos and that also nice.

1728
00:44:51.841 --> 00:44:52.710
But it's not the same.

1729
00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.823
But I,

1730
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.270
yeah,

1731
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:56.820
it's not the same that the message board is very exclusive,

1732
00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:57.991
exclusive,

1733
00:44:57.991 --> 00:44:58.470
but you know,

1734
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:59.190
limited.

1735
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:00.001
But once you see,

1736
00:45:00.001 --> 00:45:01.350
he showed the way a little bit where it's like,

1737
00:45:01.351 --> 00:45:01.620
guys,

1738
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:02.460
we don't need them anymore.

1739
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:03.060
Well,

1740
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:03.840
some of it are on.

1741
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.220
He was the first guy to break through.

1742
00:45:05.221 --> 00:45:06.450
And when I saw it I was like,

1743
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:09.390
I was looking at what he created by,

1744
00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:10.880
by breaking through like that now.

1745
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:12.060
And then I started seeing,

1746
00:45:12.061 --> 00:45:12.430
I was like,

1747
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.900
Ooh,

1748
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.220
there's gonna come a point in time.

1749
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.090
Maybe it's now,

1750
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.420
maybe it's in the future where all it's going to matter is how many people you

1751
00:45:18.421 --> 00:45:19.620
can connect with online.

1752
00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:20.830
Like what,

1753
00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:23.040
whatever you can create that people,

1754
00:45:23.041 --> 00:45:26.340
whether it's one of those videos that Brian used to do or whether it's a blog

1755
00:45:26.341 --> 00:45:30.870
entry or whether it's a standup comedy clip or whether it's a podcast,

1756
00:45:30.871 --> 00:45:32.730
which didn't even exist back then,

1757
00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:36.210
but I have a podcast called skeptic.

1758
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:38.940
Everyone should check it out.

1759
00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:39.660
It's pretty fun.

1760
00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:43.350
But that was one of the things that led us to doing those Justin.

1761
00:45:43.351 --> 00:45:44.280
Dot TV,

1762
00:45:44.281 --> 00:45:45.114
those justice.

1763
00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:48.360
The first kind of podcasts we did turn on the green room.

1764
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.740
We used to do these.

1765
00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:53.730
I used to have a thing that connected to my laptop that would like stream the

1766
00:45:53.731 --> 00:45:54.900
internet from my,

1767
00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:56.220
from like a cell phone.

1768
00:45:56.221 --> 00:45:57.150
It's a long time ago.

1769
00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:58.410
Oh yeah.

1770
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:00.810
We did have wifi and like the the cops green room.

1771
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.640
Oh it was a long time ago.

1772
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:07.590
It was one cell phone data was first starting to make an its way to laptops with

1773
00:46:07.591 --> 00:46:11.630
like this little USB things and then they started making some like thinkpads and

1774
00:46:11.631 --> 00:46:15.930
some certain cell phone or some certain laptops that had cellular connections

1775
00:46:15.931 --> 00:46:16.764
built into them.

1776
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.510
So they had a Wifi cellular data.

1777
00:46:18.511 --> 00:46:21.360
Like I have an iPad that's a Verizon iPad.

1778
00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:22.740
It's sinked up to Verizon,

1779
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:24.300
so even if there's no Wifi,

1780
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:25.380
I can still get on.

1781
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.820
I could still like,

1782
00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:27.480
wow.

1783
00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:27.811
You know,

1784
00:46:27.811 --> 00:46:29.160
look at websites and shit like that.

1785
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:29.611
I love it.

1786
00:46:29.611 --> 00:46:30.444
It's really cool.

1787
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:31.020
It's really cool.

1788
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:31.091
Yeah.

1789
00:46:31.091 --> 00:46:31.560
That's nice.

1790
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:31.801
Yeah,

1791
00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:32.370
it's nice.

1792
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:32.601
It's,

1793
00:46:32.601 --> 00:46:32.881
it's,

1794
00:46:32.881 --> 00:46:35.490
it's way better than like trying to look at something on your phone.

1795
00:46:35.491 --> 00:46:37.380
You can look at it on your why on your Ipad,

1796
00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:37.750
you know?

1797
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:39.030
It's like a real website,

1798
00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.810
but back then when we were in that room and we were doing it,

1799
00:46:42.811 --> 00:46:46.290
were streaming it from that little clunky USB thing that would stick in there,

1800
00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:47.300
that start,

1801
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:48.750
I'll start it off because they didn't cook.

1802
00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:50.790
He wasn't doing that at the time.

1803
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:51.780
He wasn't doing that,

1804
00:46:51.781 --> 00:46:54.960
but he did something online that I thought it was extraordinary.

1805
00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:56.040
I tell comics too,

1806
00:46:56.041 --> 00:46:56.400
I'm like,

1807
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:56.890
when they're like,

1808
00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:57.240
ah,

1809
00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:57.740
sort of private,

1810
00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:58.230
let's go to Paul.

1811
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.063
I was like,

1812
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.470
it might not be big and it's almost definitely won't,

1813
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:04.110
but keep doing things to move forward.

1814
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.000
You'll get a couple of fans.

1815
00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:06.390
Yeah,

1816
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:07.690
but it's not going to be at one mass.

1817
00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.600
It could easily be big if it's good.

1818
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.510
Beautiful thing about podcasts is that it's about merit.

1819
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:13.590
Like look at Joey Diaz.

1820
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:14.693
Perfect example.

1821
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.300
Joey Diaz is not famous for anything other than being awesome.

1822
00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:20.400
It all came from him being awesome.

1823
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:21.540
It didn't come from movies.

1824
00:47:21.541 --> 00:47:22.710
It didn't come from TV shows,

1825
00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.810
didn't come from anything else and they did a lot of those things,

1826
00:47:24.811 --> 00:47:25.644
did all those things.

1827
00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:30.190
Joey Diaz got famous for doing podcasts from people realizing what a funny

1828
00:47:30.191 --> 00:47:35.191
fucking guy he is just for being awesome and that that wasn't available.

1829
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:36.310
Man.

1830
00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:36.581
When I,

1831
00:47:36.581 --> 00:47:36.910
when,

1832
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:38.890
when Dane Cook popped out of the scene,

1833
00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:41.140
that was when I first became aware like,

1834
00:47:41.141 --> 00:47:41.441
Whoa,

1835
00:47:41.441 --> 00:47:43.510
the Internet isn't just for looking at stuff.

1836
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.931
It's,

1837
00:47:43.931 --> 00:47:44.890
they're putting stuff out.

1838
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.450
I love what you don't need anybody's approval [inaudible] stuff.

1839
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:49.451
Give us your fans,

1840
00:47:49.451 --> 00:47:50.200
give it to whoever.

1841
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.370
They can't take that back to them.

1842
00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:55.870
It's over and the way we use it is very unique too because we all support each

1843
00:47:55.871 --> 00:47:58.750
other and we tweet each other shit and we pump each other up.

1844
00:47:58.890 --> 00:47:59.130
We,

1845
00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.990
we do shows together like you meet Dunkin Diaz,

1846
00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:02.590
red band,

1847
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:03.251
Eddie Bravo,

1848
00:48:03.251 --> 00:48:05.080
everybody's all connected in this little thing.

1849
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:06.161
And because of that,

1850
00:48:06.161 --> 00:48:07.150
because of that connection,

1851
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:07.870
it's like,

1852
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:10.300
it makes like for an even bigger force,

1853
00:48:10.301 --> 00:48:12.010
like an even bigger impact,

1854
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:13.580
you know,

1855
00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.770
like Tripoli's fucking CD was number two on iTunes.

1856
00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:18.793
So happy.

1857
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:21.460
He was so happy it was mouth for like a week and a half.

1858
00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:21.950
Yeah.

1859
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:23.350
Like a whole week and a half.

1860
00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.220
Yeah.

1861
00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:24.641
Or happy.

1862
00:48:24.641 --> 00:48:25.474
Super happy.

1863
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:27.670
And also he sees the light at the end of the tunnel.

1864
00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:27.970
You know,

1865
00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:29.040
it's something like that happens.

1866
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:33.040
I can get a little bit of like fucking headlines all over the place in the road.

1867
00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:33.430
Now.

1868
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:34.390
He did Edmonton,

1869
00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:36.160
we did Edmonton the week before.

1870
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:36.611
He did,

1871
00:48:36.611 --> 00:48:36.970
uh,

1872
00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:41.350
the River Creek Casino with me and then he went back and got comedy club the

1873
00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:41.380
next week.

1874
00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:41.541
Yeah,

1875
00:48:41.541 --> 00:48:43.630
I was wondering that the first couple times I did it with you,

1876
00:48:43.631 --> 00:48:44.590
but it wasn't like the next week,

1877
00:48:44.591 --> 00:48:46.610
but it was like within some time and I'm like,

1878
00:48:46.611 --> 00:48:46.731
well,

1879
00:48:46.731 --> 00:48:46.811
hell,

1880
00:48:46.811 --> 00:48:47.531
it's called the club owner.

1881
00:48:47.531 --> 00:48:49.720
Make sure they're okay with it because we already had this thing booked,

1882
00:48:49.721 --> 00:48:50.440
you know?

1883
00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.800
But then a couple of them,

1884
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.021
it's okay.

1885
00:48:53.021 --> 00:48:54.820
And then you realize you're telling way more people.

1886
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:55.540
Yeah.

1887
00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:58.840
It's a lot of people will just come back and you're going to kill in front of

1888
00:48:58.841 --> 00:49:02.050
those 2000 people at the river Cree and they're going to tell them all.

1889
00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:03.190
We went to see this guy,

1890
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:04.090
Ari Shaffir.

1891
00:49:04.091 --> 00:49:04.691
Holy Shit.

1892
00:49:04.691 --> 00:49:05.470
Was He funny?

1893
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:06.011
Oh my God,

1894
00:49:06.011 --> 00:49:06.880
he's at the comedy club.

1895
00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:08.820
Next time if you get 30 people extra shelves,

1896
00:49:08.821 --> 00:49:09.161
they were like,

1897
00:49:09.161 --> 00:49:10.000
thank you so much.

1898
00:49:10.001 --> 00:49:10.834
Here's some extra money.

1899
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:16.230
They're so happy when a club like that that's consistently gets good people like

1900
00:49:17.381 --> 00:49:18.400
Brian Cowen was there.

1901
00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:20.290
We were on the plane and uh,

1902
00:49:20.291 --> 00:49:21.520
Adam Hunter was there.

1903
00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:22.271
Adam Hunter was there.

1904
00:49:22.271 --> 00:49:22.421
Yeah.

1905
00:49:22.421 --> 00:49:25.240
I was going up to Edmonton a couple of weeks ago and I ran into a hunter on a

1906
00:49:25.241 --> 00:49:25.570
plane.

1907
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:25.661
Oh,

1908
00:49:25.661 --> 00:49:26.440
that was for the hunting?

1909
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:26.681
Yeah,

1910
00:49:26.681 --> 00:49:27.490
the hundred minutes.

1911
00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:27.731
Yeah.

1912
00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:29.650
And Hunter was up there doing that comedy club.

1913
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:30.731
Kallan was there to,

1914
00:49:30.731 --> 00:49:31.660
we hunter was up there.

1915
00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:35.560
No Adam Hunt out of mind or the comedian just got the hunter.

1916
00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:37.360
I had up to five minutes.

1917
00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:38.470
Yeah,

1918
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:40.990
I've heard it's a great club that's owned by the same people who talked me out

1919
00:49:40.991 --> 00:49:42.340
of jail time at mall of America.

1920
00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:43.120
Pretty hilly.

1921
00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:43.570
Yeah.

1922
00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:44.351
They talked you out of it.

1923
00:49:44.351 --> 00:49:44.831
That got you.

1924
00:49:44.831 --> 00:49:45.280
Uh,

1925
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:45.431
yeah.

1926
00:49:45.431 --> 00:49:45.791
When I was,

1927
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:46.170
when I,

1928
00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:47.130
when I did the high,

1929
00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:48.670
the edible they,

1930
00:49:48.671 --> 00:49:51.200
so they allegedly was a really hot,

1931
00:49:51.201 --> 00:49:52.034
the edibles fan.

1932
00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:53.470
Right.

1933
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:57.310
We're not on trial a government man.

1934
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:58.690
I'm concerned.

1935
00:49:58.690 --> 00:49:59.680
I'm concerned about the future.

1936
00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:01.660
I had a conversation with someone about this today,

1937
00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:04.120
someone who was talking about um,

1938
00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:08.350
medical marijuana and marijuana being legal in Colorado and you know,

1939
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:10.140
cause I was just legal so I'll pop around.

1940
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:11.050
It's in the Rockies games.

1941
00:50:11.051 --> 00:50:13.060
So look for authentic woo.

1942
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:13.781
Amazing,

1943
00:50:13.781 --> 00:50:14.080
right?

1944
00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:14.400
Yeah.

1945
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.233
And then incredible.

1946
00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:19.930
I'm so worried about 2016 why?

1947
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:21.430
Because of a couple things.

1948
00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:22.960
The conversation went like this.

1949
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:26.830
We were talking about all this shit that's going down in Iraq and I,

1950
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:32.290
that if I rack it's really ugly and things started happening like really bad.

1951
00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:37.700
And then someone blames Obama and they blame Democrats and they blame weakness

1952
00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:41.300
switching over this time and then we'll will just tell us about with Obama.

1953
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:46.300
So Hillary doesn't have a chance can go Jeb Bush style and then I could go John

1954
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.580
Ashcroft style and then that same type of thinking.

1955
00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.930
I was like Chris Christie style that tries to like medical marijuana will never

1956
00:50:53.931 --> 00:50:54.920
be legal in my state.

1957
00:50:54.921 --> 00:50:55.401
Marijuana,

1958
00:50:55.401 --> 00:50:56.410
we never leave a little mystery.

1959
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:57.680
Children are losing,

1960
00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:59.080
they're dying out there.

1961
00:50:59.081 --> 00:50:59.914
They're parking.

1962
00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:00.890
Brains are rotting,

1963
00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.920
their feet are exploding inside their shoes,

1964
00:51:03.921 --> 00:51:07.010
their dicks or fallen off the these guys,

1965
00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.260
they're all like in that sort of vein.

1966
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:09.890
Like when he,

1967
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:12.290
when Chris Christie in 2000 fucking 14 it's spreading.

1968
00:51:12.291 --> 00:51:13.520
Misinformation is a guy who's,

1969
00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:18.960
what is he just crazy shit about cannabis and the effects on the human.

1970
00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:22.220
Her Nancy grace has been super into pop full us like six months.

1971
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:23.083
How's she been?

1972
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:24.800
She looks to pot.

1973
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:26.030
She smokes it constantly.

1974
00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:27.230
Just making that up.

1975
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.740
Yeah,

1976
00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.990
but maybe she might should probably lighten up.

1977
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.940
She probably realizes she's got to get out of that business.

1978
00:51:31.941 --> 00:51:32.774
It's bad Karma.

1979
00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:33.643
She's in the business.

1980
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:35.180
Talk about the crime spree in Denver.

1981
00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.470
She that the crime sprees here,

1982
00:51:36.471 --> 00:51:39.440
like what are you talking crime spree is here.

1983
00:51:39.441 --> 00:51:44.300
It's made its way to Florida directly proportion there.

1984
00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.153
Um,

1985
00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:49.490
this guy that I had this conversation with the conversation was worried about

1986
00:51:49.491 --> 00:51:54.491
what happens in 2016 because in 2016 snaps over and becomes Super Republican and

1987
00:51:55.371 --> 00:51:56.180
then you know,

1988
00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:58.880
things sort of go in and out.

1989
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.960
Yeah.

1990
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:00.471
I mean look,

1991
00:52:00.471 --> 00:52:03.020
the had the 60s he's worried what will happen if it goes super republican.

1992
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:03.890
Yeah,

1993
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:04.050
yeah.

1994
00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:06.860
the 60s and then you had the seventies and eighties,

1995
00:52:06.861 --> 00:52:07.910
which was Nancy Reagan.

1996
00:52:07.911 --> 00:52:08.744
Just say no.

1997
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.430
I mean that's all within two decades.

1998
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:11.570
This is your brain on drugs.

1999
00:52:11.571 --> 00:52:12.231
Remember all that shit.

2000
00:52:12.231 --> 00:52:14.480
It seems like when it snaps back to it's not smack harder,

2001
00:52:14.481 --> 00:52:15.020
harder,

2002
00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:15.430
moderate.

2003
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:16.050
The go like hard.

2004
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:16.561
And then people are like,

2005
00:52:16.561 --> 00:52:18.380
that's the one I'm like go super hard democrat.

2006
00:52:18.381 --> 00:52:19.131
That goes super.

2007
00:52:19.131 --> 00:52:23.350
And then eventually one of them is win or outlawed.

2008
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:23.870
The other one,

2009
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:27.770
they'll four in the rush tug and it'll be over or the aliens attack the aliens

2010
00:52:27.771 --> 00:52:28.604
land.

2011
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:29.533
And then we go to us.

2012
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:30.860
Remember when Ronald Reagan said that?

2013
00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:35.330
What do you mean you never remember that Ronald Reagan gave the speech that all

2014
00:52:35.331 --> 00:52:40.331
the Wacky Ufo dude's always point to evidence that the alien invasion is

2015
00:52:40.911 --> 00:52:41.744
eminent.

2016
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:46.850
It was Ronald Reagan talking about how quickly we would abandon our differences

2017
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:49.460
if we faced a threat from an alien world.

2018
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:51.620
And when he said it,

2019
00:52:51.621 --> 00:52:52.101
people were like,

2020
00:52:52.101 --> 00:52:53.960
what the fuck did you just say?

2021
00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:55.920
Like it is an interesting way.

2022
00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:59.170
No way he would say that other than if it was aliens sort of,

2023
00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.740
he was putting things into perspective.

2024
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.850
I mean it is kind of,

2025
00:53:01.851 --> 00:53:04.070
we would realize that we are citizens of the world.

2026
00:53:04.071 --> 00:53:05.990
If we were facing a threat from another world,

2027
00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:06.921
we would,

2028
00:53:06.921 --> 00:53:07.910
it would be us versus them.

2029
00:53:07.911 --> 00:53:09.170
The ultimate US versus them.

2030
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:09.760
Oh yeah.

2031
00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.440
It'd be planet earth pull.

2032
00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:12.201
Pull that up Jamie.

2033
00:53:12.201 --> 00:53:15.320
Cause it's quite fast and Roddenberry's view of the world later was like earth

2034
00:53:15.321 --> 00:53:17.450
comes together because the French region,

2035
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.140
but that's it.

2036
00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:18.741
Listen to this,

2037
00:53:18.741 --> 00:53:19.890
that little freak you out wraps.

2038
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:22.700
We need some outside universal threat.

2039
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:26.010
I occasionally think how quickly our

2040
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:31.010
<v 4>differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from</v>

2041
00:53:32.131 --> 00:53:33.450
outside this world.

2042
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:39.630
Yet I ask you is not an alien force already among us.

2043
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:45.560
What could be more alien to the universal aspirations of our people's war and

2044
00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:47.604
the threat of war.

2045
00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.780
<v 1>That's a great God damn speech,</v>

2046
00:53:49.781 --> 00:53:50.614
by the way.

2047
00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:52.650
You know Ronald Reagan was an old fuck and he,

2048
00:53:52.651 --> 00:53:52.850
he,

2049
00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:57.850
he died confused and selling arms to Iran and allegedly forgetting about it and

2050
00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:58.840
he's one of the good Republicans,

2051
00:53:59.010 --> 00:53:59.843
right?

2052
00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.430
Yeah.

2053
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:04.330
I guess back then he wasn't loved.

2054
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:05.560
I remember when I was a kid,

2055
00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:07.150
when Ronald Reagan was president,

2056
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:08.470
people fucking hate it.

2057
00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:09.040
Oh really?

2058
00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:09.873
Oh my God.

2059
00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:10.691
They hated him.

2060
00:54:10.691 --> 00:54:11.740
Especially towards the end.

2061
00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:13.210
They hit all the guys,

2062
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.931
all the presence.

2063
00:54:13.931 --> 00:54:14.540
So sick.

2064
00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:15.760
She'd because somebody off,

2065
00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:19.690
do you know Jimmy Tangle is no political comic,

2066
00:54:19.691 --> 00:54:23.080
political comic and back then in Boston he was just starting to become

2067
00:54:23.081 --> 00:54:23.680
political.

2068
00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:24.970
He was at a tape of ladies.

2069
00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:25.800
Yes.

2070
00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.570
We'll say at the comedy store and I suppose I put just like new comics.

2071
00:54:28.571 --> 00:54:30.910
Here's that shows the comedy and I hadn't talked about.

2072
00:54:30.911 --> 00:54:31.331
Some was on,

2073
00:54:31.331 --> 00:54:33.960
it just ate and it

2074
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:36.343
started.

2075
00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:37.870
It was just starting.

2076
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:40.390
How many days have you been into comedy?

2077
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:41.670
Yeah,

2078
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:44.170
he must have just less than a year.

2079
00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:44.920
Less than year,

2080
00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:47.800
and he was on tape and then you've got our city hall because he's watching with

2081
00:54:47.801 --> 00:54:48.634
Mitzi in the back.

2082
00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:49.420
He goes,

2083
00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.190
sometimes you just,

2084
00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:51.761
I forgot what he,

2085
00:54:51.761 --> 00:54:53.530
something like alongside you just don't got it.

2086
00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:54.400
Go home,

2087
00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.420
go home.

2088
00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:57.010
He said that about Doug Benson.

2089
00:54:57.250 --> 00:54:58.330
Cut it to make it seem like that.

2090
00:54:58.331 --> 00:54:59.164
I don't know.

2091
00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.310
Wow.

2092
00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.081
That's dark.

2093
00:55:01.081 --> 00:55:01.914
It was pretty funny.

2094
00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.880
But Jimmy tingle had the best job.

2095
00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.290
That was 2020 it was on 2020 yeah.

2096
00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:07.990
What was it about the comedy store?

2097
00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:09.370
I was just on the comedy and I'm,

2098
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:10.290
it's unconscious people.

2099
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:15.280
Doug Benson was up there bombing on 2020 I mean he recovered,

2100
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:16.353
recovered nicely.

2101
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:17.343
Very well.

2102
00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.101
He did very well.

2103
00:55:18.101 --> 00:55:19.390
Jimmy single was on there too.

2104
00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:19.721
Hey,

2105
00:55:19.721 --> 00:55:22.870
if I was eating a plate of shit up there too,

2106
00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:24.480
I jumped at the chance to be on 20th,

2107
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:29.020
20th chumpy credits and ate a fat pile of shit fat pile.

2108
00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:32.500
Jimmy tingle had this great joke about,

2109
00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:33.010
um,

2110
00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:37.120
when Ronald Reagan got in trouble for that,

2111
00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.021
he was,

2112
00:55:38.021 --> 00:55:38.854
um,

2113
00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:41.890
he was testifying in front of Congress and he said,

2114
00:55:41.891 --> 00:55:42.161
uh,

2115
00:55:42.161 --> 00:55:42.431
you know,

2116
00:55:42.431 --> 00:55:43.300
do you,

2117
00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:44.050
um,

2118
00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:45.580
did you sell arms to Iran?

2119
00:55:45.581 --> 00:55:46.061
And he was like,

2120
00:55:46.061 --> 00:55:46.930
I do not recall.

2121
00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:47.810
It wasn't,

2122
00:55:47.810 --> 00:55:49.230
let's put it that long and tingle.

2123
00:55:49.231 --> 00:55:49.401
Yeah.

2124
00:55:49.401 --> 00:55:50.234
And tingling goes,

2125
00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:51.190
Mister President,

2126
00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:55.360
when you sell arms to people who hate us,

2127
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.310
jot it down.

2128
00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:59.830
Write a note,

2129
00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:02.080
put it on your refrigerator.

2130
00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:04.660
It's like in that heavy,

2131
00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:06.250
heavy Boston accent.

2132
00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:07.001
That's funny.

2133
00:56:07.001 --> 00:56:07.834
Really funny.

2134
00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:08.843
Jimmy Tango.

2135
00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:09.521
How many?

2136
00:56:09.521 --> 00:56:09.940
Uh,

2137
00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:14.250
he's got 1,536 tweets following 11,000 people.

2138
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:14.770
People,

2139
00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:15.601
more people should follow him.

2140
00:56:15.601 --> 00:56:18.190
He was a funny fucking more followers and followers.

2141
00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:19.203
There you go.

2142
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:19.571
Oh,

2143
00:56:19.571 --> 00:56:22.990
here's what I can tell you to tell them the story of how you got that

2144
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.033
development deal.

2145
00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:25.533
<v 0>What Sussman did.</v>

2146
00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.280
Sossman is a wizard.

2147
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.210
Yeah.

2148
00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:33.210
I A had a development deal to do an offer to do a show on MTV.

2149
00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:34.470
And how much was that offer,

2150
00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:35.110
Joe?

2151
00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:35.943
I don't remember.

2152
00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:38.320
I don't really remember the money story I heard.

2153
00:56:38.321 --> 00:56:40.540
I think I remember it being like $500.

2154
00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:41.861
It wasn't more,

2155
00:56:41.861 --> 00:56:43.030
it's like a technical amount,

2156
00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:43.780
but it wasn't like,

2157
00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:44.531
it wasn't much.

2158
00:56:44.531 --> 00:56:45.700
It was somewhere around that.

2159
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:47.590
It wasn't much at all.

2160
00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:50.590
It was like they give you money for a week to do this pilot.

2161
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:52.030
It was really cheap.

2162
00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:53.680
And then if you did that pilot,

2163
00:56:53.681 --> 00:56:55.420
you were locked up for like years.

2164
00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:56.191
Like it was,

2165
00:56:56.191 --> 00:56:58.090
he locked up for like some long term contract.

2166
00:56:58.540 --> 00:56:59.051
So,

2167
00:56:59.051 --> 00:56:59.884
um,

2168
00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:04.930
Sussman decided to take my tape and then he was sent it out to all these

2169
00:57:07.541 --> 00:57:11.410
different development companies like NBC and CBS.

2170
00:57:11.411 --> 00:57:11.561
Yeah,

2171
00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:11.710
he,

2172
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:14.560
well he's just a wizard when it comes to planning a shit.

2173
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:16.600
So he sent this thing out and said,

2174
00:57:16.601 --> 00:57:16.691
hey,

2175
00:57:16.691 --> 00:57:18.910
this guy's about to sign a development deal for MTV.

2176
00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:19.570
Um,

2177
00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:21.430
if you want to do something with them,

2178
00:57:21.431 --> 00:57:22.264
you've got to act now.

2179
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:23.770
So you create like this domain.

2180
00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:24.790
Yeah.

2181
00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:27.220
And then all of a sudden my phone was ringing off the hook.

2182
00:57:27.221 --> 00:57:28.540
I had to leave my apartment.

2183
00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:30.550
I couldn't stay in my house because people are calling me.

2184
00:57:30.551 --> 00:57:31.530
They were sending me the same sand,

2185
00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:32.950
they're going to send a flight out for me.

2186
00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:35.640
I'm going gonna fly out of La Tonight and uh,

2187
00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:36.760
meet us out in,

2188
00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:38.100
or fly out of New York tonight,

2189
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:39.340
Munis and La in the morning.

2190
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:40.151
And,

2191
00:57:40.151 --> 00:57:40.780
uh,

2192
00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:45.370
you will have a 10:00 AM morning meeting with this guy at this executive and

2193
00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:46.750
this fucking network,

2194
00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:47.621
this fucking thing.

2195
00:57:47.621 --> 00:57:47.741
Like,

2196
00:57:47.741 --> 00:57:48.640
it was craziness,

2197
00:57:48.641 --> 00:57:48.911
right?

2198
00:57:48.911 --> 00:57:50.740
So I talked to Saltzman Saltzman goes,

2199
00:57:50.741 --> 00:57:51.431
don't answer the phone.

2200
00:57:51.431 --> 00:57:52.330
Just go to the pool hall.

2201
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:53.350
I'll call you that.

2202
00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:54.730
I didn't even have to cell phone back then.

2203
00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:55.630
No one had cell phones.

2204
00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:56.770
This is 1993.

2205
00:57:56.771 --> 00:57:57.490
Right?

2206
00:57:57.490 --> 00:57:58.360
So I,

2207
00:57:58.361 --> 00:57:59.194
um,

2208
00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:01.300
I take off,

2209
00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:05.260
I go to the pool when within two days it had just gotten completely crazy.

2210
00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:06.071
And then,

2211
00:58:06.071 --> 00:58:06.520
uh,

2212
00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:09.640
I think like a couple days after that I had a development deal with Disney,

2213
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.120
Disney one out and the next thing you know I was fucking flying out there and

2214
00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:15.070
talking to those guys.

2215
00:58:15.071 --> 00:58:15.550
Yeah.

2216
00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:17.470
Flying to La and talking to these people.

2217
00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:22.030
Gary Valentine stayed in my hotel room with me because Gary was a out of here.

2218
00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:22.380
Yeah,

2219
00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:23.111
Gary was out here.

2220
00:58:23.111 --> 00:58:26.140
Huffin and Kevin James had just one last comic standing.

2221
00:58:26.141 --> 00:58:26.890
So Kevin,

2222
00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:28.990
which has every lesson was not last comic standing,

2223
00:58:28.991 --> 00:58:29.321
excuse me,

2224
00:58:29.321 --> 00:58:32.980
Star Star structure starts with Kevin One star search.

2225
00:58:32.981 --> 00:58:34.480
So it was like a big deal.

2226
00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:35.141
Onstar.

2227
00:58:35.141 --> 00:58:36.580
So you definitely want a few rounds,

2228
00:58:36.581 --> 00:58:37.330
whatever it was.

2229
00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:37.990
Maybe want it.

2230
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.823
I Dunno.

2231
00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:39.723
Um,

2232
00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:40.480
he was fun.

2233
00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.350
He was really good.

2234
00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:42.340
Kevin James,

2235
00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.540
a very underrated comic,

2236
00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:44.440
very underrated.

2237
00:58:44.441 --> 00:58:47.380
Stand up the time he was killing it,

2238
00:58:47.381 --> 00:58:47.800
man.

2239
00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:48.341
He was killing,

2240
00:58:48.341 --> 00:58:50.230
he doesn't do it much anymore cause he does a lot of movies.

2241
00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:51.910
But anyway,

2242
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:52.450
um,

2243
00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:53.920
so within,

2244
00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.260
I got $150,000.

2245
00:58:56.290 --> 00:58:57.123
That's hilarious.

2246
00:58:57.850 --> 00:58:58.683
One 50,

2247
00:58:58.740 --> 00:58:59.620
150,000,

2248
00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:01.293
150 grand.

2249
00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:05.740
I went from being broke to 150 $200,000 craziest thing ever.

2250
00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:10.460
And then from then he just used their ability to like not be able to decipher

2251
00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.080
themselves like,

2252
00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:11.201
oh,

2253
00:59:11.201 --> 00:59:12.034
somebody else likes to look.

2254
00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:12.903
Hold on.

2255
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:13.211
Well,

2256
00:59:13.211 --> 00:59:18.211
he was also pissed off because the executives at NBC or a MTV rather,

2257
00:59:18.851 --> 00:59:23.000
they had this idea and the idea was that they had created stars,

2258
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:23.601
so they're like,

2259
00:59:23.601 --> 00:59:24.890
they did it with Denis leary and Dennis,

2260
00:59:24.891 --> 00:59:25.081
really?

2261
00:59:25.081 --> 00:59:25.914
You're left.

2262
00:59:26.050 --> 00:59:26.631
And so they were like,

2263
00:59:26.631 --> 00:59:27.740
we're not going to do that again.

2264
00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:28.940
Like we create stars.

2265
00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:29.531
If you come with us,

2266
00:59:29.531 --> 00:59:30.110
you're going to make it.

2267
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:30.741
It'll make you famous.

2268
00:59:30.741 --> 00:59:31.574
We don't have to pay you.

2269
00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.260
So they didn't want to pay much money.

2270
00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:33.980
Yeah,

2271
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:34.631
that's still the thing.

2272
00:59:34.631 --> 00:59:34.850
It's like,

2273
00:59:34.850 --> 00:59:36.920
and I know we mixed our was like sometimes not anymore.

2274
00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:38.530
Remember that?

2275
00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:38.871
Listen,

2276
00:59:38.871 --> 00:59:40.460
that fucking boat has sailed.

2277
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:41.750
That boat has gone.

2278
00:59:41.751 --> 00:59:42.620
It's not in the harbor.

2279
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:43.910
You can't even see it on the horizon.

2280
00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:44.661
That's a joke.

2281
00:59:44.661 --> 00:59:47.030
There's a million fucking cable channels now.

2282
00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:49.220
The idea that your one network,

2283
00:59:49.221 --> 00:59:51.260
it's valuable is preposterous.

2284
00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:54.830
Back then it was valuable because there weren't that many fucking channels.

2285
00:59:54.831 --> 00:59:56.690
There was no history channel and discovery channel,

2286
00:59:56.691 --> 00:59:57.270
Saifai,

2287
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:58.103
Spike TV,

2288
00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:59.330
all that shit didn't exist.

2289
00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:03.920
So MTV fucking Netflix now x box and and their own channel.

2290
01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:04.550
It's over.

2291
01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:04.851
It's over.

2292
01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.380
Direct TV has their own shows.

2293
01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:10.520
Back then it was like MTV had remote control and MTV created Jenny McCarthy.

2294
01:00:11.010 --> 01:00:11.510
Yup.

2295
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:13.610
And they created Chris Hardwick.

2296
01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:16.180
A lot of people forget that Jenny McCarthy show.

2297
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:18.280
He was the fucking guy who was on it with the,

2298
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.320
and for the longest time Jenny McCarthy was a famous one and Chris harder cause

2299
01:00:21.321 --> 01:00:25.310
the one that nobody who knew who the fuck he was and he fancies humongous.

2300
01:00:25.311 --> 01:00:29.690
Now Chris Hardwick is bawling because we're past world.

2301
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:34.280
He's took over the podcast world and the nurse Chris,

2302
01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:38.930
Chris Hardwick with Jenny Mccarthy and some chick who's got a nice ass.

2303
01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:41.090
Very nice common electric power.

2304
01:00:41.091 --> 01:00:41.930
That's what I'm talking about.

2305
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:44.600
That's a booty for the agents was on that show.

2306
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.990
Yup.

2307
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.823
Oh Wow.

2308
01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.111
This is all,

2309
01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:50.120
when I was an open miker this shit was going on there.

2310
01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:50.601
A good joke.

2311
01:00:50.601 --> 01:00:50.870
When he,

2312
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:52.100
when we were at open mics together.

2313
01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:53.163
<v 1>What do you still drink?</v>

2314
01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.780
It was this weekend.

2315
01:00:54.781 --> 01:00:57.120
I learned something at a wedding.

2316
01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:00.210
It's never okay to spill beer on a baby.

2317
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:01.770
Ooh,

2318
01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:03.300
it's true.

2319
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:03.840
Yeah,

2320
01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:04.630
it's true.

2321
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:05.530
<v 0>What was that other show?</v>

2322
01:01:05.531 --> 01:01:06.850
MTV remote control.

2323
01:01:06.851 --> 01:01:07.480
I remember that.

2324
01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:07.710
Yeah.

2325
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.901
Or MOCA.

2326
01:01:07.901 --> 01:01:09.130
Show salt that may Colin Quinn.

2327
01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:10.323
Yeah.

2328
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.860
It didn't really though.

2329
01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:12.850
Made Adam Sandler.

2330
01:01:12.851 --> 01:01:13.421
Colin Quinn.

2331
01:01:13.421 --> 01:01:14.420
People didn't know he wasn't it.

2332
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:15.820
It really making the time I live made them.

2333
01:01:15.821 --> 01:01:17.670
It got them known to be on tire live.

2334
01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:18.730
Got Him a little fame.

2335
01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.840
Where's Ken Ober?

2336
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:21.310
Remember that guy?

2337
01:01:21.370 --> 01:01:22.091
He was a jeweler.

2338
01:01:22.091 --> 01:01:22.211
Oh,

2339
01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:22.790

congratulations.

2343
01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:27.530
He died in 2009 wow.

2344
01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:31.730
Verizon will not turn on my Internet service.

2345
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.780
Wow.

2346
01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:33.680
New York life is,

2347
01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:36.290
she's 52 complaining of headaches.

2348
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:37.400
Chronic chest pain.

2349
01:01:37.401 --> 01:01:38.320
Flu like symptoms.

2350
01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:39.080
Really?

2351
01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:39.913
Yeah.

2352
01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:40.813
Wow.

2353
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:42.440
I Dunno man.

2354
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:43.250
That's fucked.

2355
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:44.780
Look at Colin Quinn there.

2356
01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:47.030
Holy Shit on the far right.

2357
01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:48.500
The guy laying down.

2358
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:49.950
Probably contestant maybe.

2359
01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.313
Wow.

2360
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:52.430
That's crazy.

2361
01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.160
Remote control.

2362
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:58.910
That was another big MTV show and it was supposed to be taking,

2363
01:01:58.911 --> 01:02:00.530
placing like Ken Obers basement,

2364
01:02:00.531 --> 01:02:02.660
like video that the idea was that his,

2365
01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:06.260
his parents had a basement and he always wants to have his own show,

2366
01:02:06.261 --> 01:02:07.190
so we put a show together.

2367
01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:07.910
Oh really?

2368
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:08.361
Yeah.

2369
01:02:08.361 --> 01:02:09.470
Something like this.

2370
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.843
Yeah.

2371
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.170
They had a show with a,

2372
01:02:13.171 --> 01:02:14.780
the chick from the Brady bunch.

2373
01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:18.260
It was a talk show called Ober and Olsen.

2374
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.050
Really?

2375
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:19.883
Yeah.

2376
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:23.190
Dennis leary was on remote control too.

2377
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.180
That's what launched him.

2378
01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.433
Wow.

2379
01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:26.423
Yeah.

2380
01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:28.560
And then MTV started doing these things for them.

2381
01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.270
All these little promo clips.

2382
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.960
It's hilarious.

2383
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.250
Promo credit rents.

2384
01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:33.280
Yeah.

2385
01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.200
And that's sort of what made them,

2386
01:02:34.201 --> 01:02:35.034
and then you know,

2387
01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.300
showtime special,

2388
01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:37.143
whatever it was,

2389
01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:37.831
showtime,

2390
01:02:37.831 --> 01:02:39.060
HBO or whatever the fuck his specialty.

2391
01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:41.220
They have fucking nano girl soon.

2392
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:43.180
Adam Sandler look at the girl's hair behind them.

2393
01:02:43.181 --> 01:02:44.190
It's interesting.

2394
01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.830
That's like from his show that 80 showed the wedding singer.

2395
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:47.671
God Damn,

2396
01:02:47.671 --> 01:02:48.870
the 80s were weird.

2397
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.210
That is so weird.

2398
01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:52.620
Look at the eighties man.

2399
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:53.971
What year was this?

2400
01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:54.804
Shit?

2401
01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:58.620
1987 don't get sun,

2402
01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:01.940
dare you picture,

2403
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:03.263
but don't guess,

2404
01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.920
don't gas always look.

2405
01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.080
It was in syndication.

2406
01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:08.880
89 to 90 really?

2407
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.073
Yeah.

2408
01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.560
It ran for five seasons from 87 to 1990 they had five seasons in three years.

2409
01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:16.531
I don't know how you'd do that,

2410
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:17.650
but um,

2411
01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:19.020
yeah.

2412
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:22.290
Mtvs first original nonmusical program.

2413
01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:23.220
Wow.

2414
01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:23.551
Wow.

2415
01:03:23.551 --> 01:03:27.160
Really new episodes were made for first run syndication.

2416
01:03:27.161 --> 01:03:27.994
You convincing them,

2417
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.333
hey,

2418
01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.370
I want to do something in the network that you just don't do.

2419
01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:33.653
I don't know.

2420
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:35.940
We want to do any music.

2421
01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:37.170
Break it up a little bit.

2422
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.730
The people that I talked to that were over there,

2423
01:03:38.731 --> 01:03:39.900
they wanted to break it up a bit.

2424
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.351
Oh,

2425
01:03:40.351 --> 01:03:40.751
you know who?

2426
01:03:40.751 --> 01:03:45.751
What it also made Carrie were you remember her carry wherever she is still hot.

2427
01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:51.530
She's 47 well,

2428
01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:52.381
that picture isn't it?

2429
01:03:52.381 --> 01:03:53.100
Yeah.

2430
01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:53.933
Look at the picture.

2431
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:55.591
That's her.

2432
01:03:55.591 --> 01:03:56.130
No,

2433
01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:57.000
no.

2434
01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.550
That's her from back then.

2435
01:03:59.551 --> 01:04:02.280
But if you see there's a picture of her now and Wikipedia.

2436
01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:02.691
Gosh,

2437
01:04:02.691 --> 01:04:03.211
she's cute.

2438
01:04:03.211 --> 01:04:04.044
She's still hot.

2439
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:07.500
She's got that a sexy mill thing going on.

2440
01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:11.250
Kapow Kapow Citizenship Cambridge.

2441
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.593
Is that her now?

2442
01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:13.770
It looks,

2443
01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:14.610
that's hard today.

2444
01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.710
I'm still in shape.

2445
01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:17.540
So unsafe,

2446
01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:17.910
powerful.

2447
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:22.200
Kerry war were or where were here where her I was on.

2448
01:04:22.201 --> 01:04:24.000
I'm politically incorrect with her.

2449
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:26.310
No really way back in the day,

2450
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:30.540
like in 1990 something I think.

2451
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.620
I think it was like,

2452
01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:33.690
I want to say,

2453
01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.830
I want to say it was the fear factor days,

2454
01:04:37.831 --> 01:04:39.180
but it might have been before that.

2455
01:04:39.181 --> 01:04:40.560
It might've been the news radio days.

2456
01:04:40.561 --> 01:04:41.394
I'm not even sure.

2457
01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:44.910
I know I was on at least once.

2458
01:04:45.330 --> 01:04:45.541
Yeah,

2459
01:04:45.541 --> 01:04:46.374
there's Carrie.

2460
01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:47.930
Carrie were were were,

2461
01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:50.280
were were though is.

2462
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:52.500
I don't remember at all.

2463
01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:55.630
She's hot as fuck you back in the news radio days.

2464
01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.473
Sexy as fuck.

2465
01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:00.170
Let a hair almost almost full.

2466
01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:02.270
Starting to go kind of shirts too.

2467
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:04.170
I love those big over the elbow.

2468
01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:05.363
Yeah.

2469
01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:10.080
I think was the news radio days and then after that was the a I did it again on

2470
01:05:10.081 --> 01:05:10.914
fear factor.

2471
01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:11.761
Oh,

2472
01:05:11.761 --> 01:05:12.510
that shirt.

2473
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:12.841
No,

2474
01:05:12.841 --> 01:05:13.021
no,

2475
01:05:13.021 --> 01:05:13.170
no,

2476
01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:13.321
no.

2477
01:05:13.321 --> 01:05:15.000
That show politically incorrect.

2478
01:05:15.001 --> 01:05:15.540
Whoa.

2479
01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:16.980
That was before he got in.

2480
01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:21.700
Remember he got in trouble for saying that we're cowards for fucking launching.

2481
01:05:21.701 --> 01:05:22.780
Never lost respect for him.

2482
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.520
Why'd you lose respect for him?

2483
01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:26.920
Not for that because he didn't stand up for it.

2484
01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:27.551
No.

2485
01:05:27.551 --> 01:05:30.190
Cause when I saw him this first show on an HBO afterwards,

2486
01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:31.660
he's like cursed and it goes,

2487
01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.490
this is why we wanted to come here.

2488
01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:36.100
This is why I wanted to get off network and come here like,

2489
01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:36.611
bitch,

2490
01:05:36.611 --> 01:05:40.240
you got thrown off pretending like you're responsible for that.

2491
01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:41.890
Begged for your job back.

2492
01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.330
He's a rebel.

2493
01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:44.320
The fuck you talking about?

2494
01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:45.731
Do you not know?

2495
01:05:45.731 --> 01:05:46.300
He's a rebel.

2496
01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:46.930
He's a,

2497
01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:47.950
that's what I like about it in the most,

2498
01:05:47.951 --> 01:05:49.390
he's a reference a dude.

2499
01:05:49.391 --> 01:05:50.224
He's a rebel.

2500
01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:51.070
Okay.

2501
01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:51.990
Wrecking Verizon.

2502
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.800
Maybe wait three times all day long for God damn technicians who never showed

2503
01:05:56.801 --> 01:05:57.310
up.

2504
01:05:57.310 --> 01:05:58.390
What does it have to do with Kerry war?

2505
01:05:58.391 --> 01:05:59.111
Where was the thing?

2506
01:05:59.111 --> 01:06:00.930
I just keep thinking about it and you're all angry brown.

2507
01:06:00.931 --> 01:06:02.110
I supposed to come on Saturday.

2508
01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:04.510
Verizon fries Internet.

2509
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.650
Oh you fucking,

2510
01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:06.940
you're really angry there right now.

2511
01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.140
It's the worst.

2512
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:09.790
And you call and be like,

2513
01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:09.981
sorry,

2514
01:06:09.981 --> 01:06:11.980
I get so angry at like the customer service.

2515
01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.570
I know they're not to blame,

2516
01:06:13.571 --> 01:06:16.540
but it's like fucking what time they going to be.

2517
01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:17.800
Stop saying you're sorry.

2518
01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:19.570
Stop it.

2519
01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:20.403
It's an insult.

2520
01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:24.810
Three days I've given up just waiting there for people that don't show up.

2521
01:06:24.810 --> 01:06:24.920
No.

2522
01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.070
So really guarantee with be done.

2523
01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.460
It'd be on by 5:00 PM today.

2524
01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.360
You're very upset.

2525
01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:32.620
Did you know how you go to someone's page and you know them on Twitter,

2526
01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:34.240
but then they don't follow you and you get sad?

2527
01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:34.630
Yeah,

2528
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:35.830
that's what I just went to carry.

2529
01:06:35.831 --> 01:06:37.060
Where were his page?

2530
01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.141
And she's not,

2531
01:06:38.141 --> 01:06:38.951
but I'm not following her.

2532
01:06:38.951 --> 01:06:40.840
So he just remembered her for the first time.

2533
01:06:40.841 --> 01:06:43.240
It's 20 years saying easy.

2534
01:06:43.241 --> 01:06:45.940
I'm trying to be nice looking at a recent picks.

2535
01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:46.480
No,

2536
01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.670
I just followed her on Twitter.

2537
01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.600
Whatever recent picks.

2538
01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:51.213
Put them up.

2539
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:52.120
It's pretty man.

2540
01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:52.331
Yeah.

2541
01:06:52.331 --> 01:06:52.670
Let me see.

2542
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:53.503
She's hanging in there.

2543
01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.331
You know what?

2544
01:06:55.331 --> 01:06:58.070
I saw a TV show the other day and wonder woman was on it.

2545
01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:58.780
You can't put them.

2546
01:06:58.780 --> 01:06:59.613
Oh really?

2547
01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.600
How was she as a motherfucker?

2548
01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:02.663
Aw.

2549
01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:03.760
Times a motherfucker.

2550
01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.380
Time is such a motherfucker.

2551
01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:07.240
Linda was ended up hard time.

2552
01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:07.541
Time.

2553
01:07:07.541 --> 01:07:08.560
See what's become of me.

2554
01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:10.000
Yeah,

2555
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:10.161
look,

2556
01:07:10.161 --> 01:07:10.994
it was become a her.

2557
01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:11.913
She that chick.

2558
01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:12.551
Oh,

2559
01:07:12.551 --> 01:07:13.384
the bags go.

2560
01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:14.380
Not so good.

2561
01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:15.070
Really?

2562
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:15.431
Oh No,

2563
01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:15.581
no,

2564
01:07:15.581 --> 01:07:15.761
no,

2565
01:07:15.761 --> 01:07:15.971
no.

2566
01:07:15.971 --> 01:07:16.631
I'm confused.

2567
01:07:16.631 --> 01:07:17.590
She's actually still pretty.

2568
01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:18.521
Uh,

2569
01:07:18.521 --> 01:07:22.240
for whatever reason I associated her with Jace grace.

2570
01:07:22.241 --> 01:07:23.460
Slick from uh,

2571
01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:25.090
from Jefferson star ship.

2572
01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.620
The tall black lady.

2573
01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:27.370
No,

2574
01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:28.203
that's Grace Jones.

2575
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:31.090
That was the one who Dolph Lundgren.

2576
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:31.450
Yeah.

2577
01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:31.631
No,

2578
01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:31.720
no,

2579
01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:31.961
no.

2580
01:07:31.961 --> 01:07:32.830
She didn't date flavor.

2581
01:07:32.831 --> 01:07:36.140
Flave you shit then she is a vet.

2582
01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:36.760
No,

2583
01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:37.301
no flavor.

2584
01:07:37.301 --> 01:07:40.960
Flave was the girl used to be married to Sylvester Stallone.

2585
01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:41.823
Who was that?

2586
01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.170
Bridgette Nielsen.

2587
01:07:43.210 --> 01:07:43.870
Yeah.

2588
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:44.590
Oh,

2589
01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:46.440
she was the one who dated flavor flip.

2590
01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.333
Yeah.

2591
01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.000
Confusing everybody.

2592
01:07:49.001 --> 01:07:49.834
Man.

2593
01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:50.920
I barely know you.

2594
01:07:50.921 --> 01:07:51.700
Actors.

2595
01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.170
I barely fucking know you.

2596
01:07:53.171 --> 01:07:54.070
That's your legacy.

2597
01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:54.953
Ah.

2598
01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:56.663
Um,

2599
01:07:56.710 --> 01:08:00.070
the grace slick was the lead singer of Jeff Jefferson star ship.

2600
01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:02.280
I need to go a lot of those Mexico.

2601
01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:03.143
Yeah.

2602
01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:08.950
Grace Slick was hot at one point in time within times a mother fucker.

2603
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:09.730
Dude.

2604
01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:10.563
Time doesn't wait.

2605
01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:11.770
Time gives no fucks.

2606
01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.990
Time keeps swinging.

2607
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.010
Even if your down time kicks you.

2608
01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.593
It was cool being,

2609
01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:18.493
let's wrap it up.

2610
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:19.310
But this is,

2611
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:20.060
uh,

2612
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:20.960
come back to the beginning.

2613
01:08:20.961 --> 01:08:24.350
It was cool being a forbidden city and the Great Wall of China and tucked in

2614
01:08:24.351 --> 01:08:24.771
these walls.

2615
01:08:24.771 --> 01:08:26.840
They like this has been here for a long time.

2616
01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:27.680
Yeah.

2617
01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.730
What did that feel like?

2618
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:30.950
It just was this cool connection to the past.

2619
01:08:30.951 --> 01:08:31.790
I mean it's not real,

2620
01:08:31.791 --> 01:08:35.570
but it just imagine this like emperors have been by here and touch this.

2621
01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:36.770
How about the Mongols?

2622
01:08:36.771 --> 01:08:39.410
They built it to fucking fight off the step people.

2623
01:08:39.790 --> 01:08:41.600
How did they did the matching separate?

2624
01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.550
Imagine walking through the forest,

2625
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:48.350
trudging and marching through the forest up and down mountains is mountainy

2626
01:08:48.351 --> 01:08:53.090
forests and then you're getting not even close to look their land and then all

2627
01:08:53.091 --> 01:08:53.601
of a sudden you're like,

2628
01:08:53.601 --> 01:08:54.434
what

2629
01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:58.580
the giant wall that you could see from space.

2630
01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.690
Get the horses up there.

2631
01:08:59.691 --> 01:09:00.590
I'll go around.

2632
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:04.520
You'd March three miles like all guys do even know which way is the end of this.

2633
01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.110
There's no end.

2634
01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.190
How long is that wall look at you?

2635
01:09:09.210 --> 01:09:12.170
You sexy bitch with no shirt holding the fucking Chinese flag.

2636
01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:14.570
I love taking my shirt off back.

2637
01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.070
They just think all the Chinese Bikini,

2638
01:09:16.071 --> 01:09:18.740
they just took this up and the men walking around like that.

2639
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.150
Why did you like taking your shirt off?

2640
01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:21.290
I love taking my shirt off.

2641
01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:22.370
I know his son in me.

2642
01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:23.300
Okay.

2643
01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:23.720
Yeah.

2644
01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:24.051
All right.

2645
01:09:24.051 --> 01:09:24.430
Keep pushing.

2646
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:26.120
Keep it closed on me here.

2647
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:29.060
So I walked out to the top password.

2648
01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:31.070
People like stop walking and then there's one guy is like,

2649
01:09:31.071 --> 01:09:32.750
if you go another as many kilometers,

2650
01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:35.230
that's like tower 23 that's as far as you can go.

2651
01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:35.601
And I was like,

2652
01:09:35.601 --> 01:09:35.961
fine,

2653
01:09:35.961 --> 01:09:36.650
cause I'm doing it.

2654
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:38.460
So you walked all the way to the end.

2655
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:41.150
It was so hot and so humid and so many steps.

2656
01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.470
Irregular shape steps.

2657
01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:43.880
It was so hard.

2658
01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:45.260
How long has the Great Wall?

2659
01:09:45.261 --> 01:09:46.430
Like what is the total district?

2660
01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:47.630
We got up somewhere.

2661
01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.420
We got up to somewhere near where this Toboggan to get down.

2662
01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:50.811
Okay,

2663
01:09:50.811 --> 01:09:51.410
let's find out.

2664
01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:52.040
But yeah,

2665
01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.120
it's the only manmade object.

2666
01:09:53.121 --> 01:09:54.110
Viewable from space.

2667
01:09:55.410 --> 01:09:55.850
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2668
01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:57.350
<v 1>The Great Wall of China.</v>

2669
01:10:01.290 --> 01:10:02.430
<v 5>Jesus Christ,</v>

2670
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:04.170
5,500 miles.

2671
01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:04.891
<v 1>This is it.</v>

2672
01:10:04.891 --> 01:10:05.820
That's insane.

2673
01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.433
Is that right?

2674
01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:08.670
5,000 what?

2675
01:10:08.730 --> 01:10:10.080
5,500 miles.

2676
01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:10.590
Is that right?

2677
01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:12.030
Longer than the United States of America.

2678
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:13.640
It goes up and gets windy too.

2679
01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:14.850
It goes up and over things.

2680
01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:16.050
Is that really right?

2681
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:18.680
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2682
01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.513
<v 1>Maybe.</v>

2683
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:20.930
Oh my God.

2684
01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:21.890
Wow.

2685
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:22.940
Undertaking was that.

2686
01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.220
That's like some pyramid level shit,

2687
01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:25.520
right?

2688
01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:25.910
How many really?

2689
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:26.451
That's about it.

2690
01:10:26.451 --> 01:10:27.284
Yeah.

2691
01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:29.870
It's 8,850 kilometers,

2692
01:10:29.871 --> 01:10:31.610
which is 5,000 just a straight up wall.

2693
01:10:32.670 --> 01:10:32.980
There's,

2694
01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:36.020
there's battlements you could stick your Arrow through and fire down without

2695
01:10:36.021 --> 01:10:36.854
getting shot.

2696
01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:37.821
It's all built.

2697
01:10:37.821 --> 01:10:38.654
Well,

2698
01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:39.493
that's so crazy.

2699
01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.270
I didn't know it was that long.

2700
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:42.980
It goes on forever.

2701
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:44.450
I figured it was like a hundred miles.

2702
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:46.190
That's what I thought.

2703
01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:46.641
My head.

2704
01:10:46.641 --> 01:10:47.061
I was like,

2705
01:10:47.061 --> 01:10:47.730
Eh,

2706
01:10:47.730 --> 01:10:49.670
a hundred miles probably.

2707
01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:50.990
That seems like long enough.

2708
01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.130
That's the not so great wall.

2709
01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:53.720
That's a wall.

2710
01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.010
Look how far it goes.

2711
01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:56.990
That's crazy.

2712
01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:58.431
Oh my God.

2713
01:10:58.431 --> 01:10:59.630
We are looking at a map right now.

2714
01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:01.670
It's a greater great wall.

2715
01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:02.450
That's what it says.

2716
01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:03.283
Is that what it says?

2717
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:04.183
Lengthen outbreak.

2718
01:11:05.150 --> 01:11:06.200
Extended sections.

2719
01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:07.913
What?

2720
01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.620
Why would they keep building a wall?

2721
01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.090
They do this a lot where they go,

2722
01:11:11.091 --> 01:11:11.924
uh,

2723
01:11:12.170 --> 01:11:13.320
we're going to Redo all this stuff.

2724
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.980
We're going to upkeep

2725
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:14.370
<v 0>it,</v>

2726
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.570
and they just replaced the wood.

2727
01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:16.080
They were placed,

2728
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:16.260
the,

2729
01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:18.750
the stuff they just like as if someone was still living here,

2730
01:11:18.751 --> 01:11:19.500
we're just going to keep it,

2731
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.310
keep it going.

2732
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.950
Wow.

2733
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:21.210
Yeah.

2734
01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:22.043
Weird.

2735
01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:26.580
It shows like they built and then date renovated will be like 45 years ago.

2736
01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:27.001
Right.

2737
01:11:27.001 --> 01:11:27.990
But why would they extend it?

2738
01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:28.831
I don't know.

2739
01:11:28.831 --> 01:11:29.664
Make it more of a,

2740
01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:30.420
I don't know.

2741
01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:31.260
Is it a tourist trap?

2742
01:11:31.261 --> 01:11:31.980
Is that what it is?

2743
01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:32.920
They extending it for,

2744
01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:34.200
for more tourist traps.

2745
01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:35.880
I went outside Beijing.

2746
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:37.290
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2747
01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:38.123
<v 0>Wow.</v>

2748
01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:38.993
What else can we do this,

2749
01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.260
why else would they do that?

2750
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:41.880
That doesn't make any sense.

2751
01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:45.160
Did you know the South Korea was smushed up against China?

2752
01:11:45.161 --> 01:11:45.994
Like that?

2753
01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:47.220
Where's that?

2754
01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:48.443
Oh,

2755
01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:49.643
right over there.

2756
01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:51.960
That's an insane,

2757
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.171
like,

2758
01:11:52.171 --> 01:11:53.640
it's so much bigger than Korea.

2759
01:11:53.850 --> 01:11:55.200
It's fucking huge.

2760
01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:57.150
I can't believe the wall was that big.

2761
01:11:58.230 --> 01:11:59.490
Maybe they just hate pink Floyd

2762
01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:03.440
down.

2763
01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:03.690
Shit.

2764
01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:06.690
I'm gonna keep going up even in the years after this is relevant as a defense

2765
01:12:06.691 --> 01:12:07.410
force,

2766
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:08.243
but you,

2767
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:09.111
did you,

2768
01:12:09.111 --> 01:12:09.540
um,

2769
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.700
ever see the renovations are doing to the Sphinx?

2770
01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:12.571
No.

2771
01:12:12.571 --> 01:12:13.080
What are they doing?

2772
01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.880
It's Kinda sad putting those back on.

2773
01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:15.511
No,

2774
01:12:15.511 --> 01:12:16.070
they are doing,

2775
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:18.390
they fix up the feet and shit and they're,

2776
01:12:18.391 --> 01:12:19.920
they're patching up the body,

2777
01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:21.390
but they're not really,

2778
01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:24.450
what they're doing is they're building their own version of it.

2779
01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:25.200
Oh really?

2780
01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:25.651
Yeah,

2781
01:12:25.651 --> 01:12:27.870
because they're covering over the Sphinx.

2782
01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.940
Like they're making the feet all smooth.

2783
01:12:29.941 --> 01:12:33.730
Like Jamie pull up the actual stone has something to it here,

2784
01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.280
not the design.

2785
01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:36.480
This is what's been here,

2786
01:12:36.481 --> 01:12:37.170
this object.

2787
01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:39.270
It's just a really soft stone.

2788
01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:40.200
And it's like,

2789
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.680
it's all worn out and shit style letting it flow down.

2790
01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:43.590
Yeah.

2791
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:44.161
No Shit.

2792
01:12:44.161 --> 01:12:45.120
But they don't do that.

2793
01:12:45.370 --> 01:12:46.530
How long it lasts on it.

2794
01:12:46.531 --> 01:12:47.370
So what do these pictures,

2795
01:12:47.371 --> 01:12:47.881
cause it's Kinda,

2796
01:12:47.881 --> 01:12:51.270
it's Kinda gross because what they're doing is they're making the feet all

2797
01:12:51.271 --> 01:12:52.440
smooth and shit.

2798
01:12:52.441 --> 01:12:54.010
And like the word pause,

2799
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:55.330
our was totally irregular.

2800
01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:58.860
Let's go to the video tape surveys.

2801
01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:01.283
What do you uh,

2802
01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:01.921
I found a page.

2803
01:13:01.921 --> 01:13:04.050
There was an Egyptian and just look up images,

2804
01:13:04.051 --> 01:13:06.390
do a Google search and images as Jamie instead of failing.

2805
01:13:06.391 --> 01:13:07.290
Why don't you not fail?

2806
01:13:07.291 --> 01:13:07.471
How about,

2807
01:13:07.471 --> 01:13:07.681
you know,

2808
01:13:07.681 --> 01:13:08.850
fail fucker.

2809
01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:11.380
That'll get you see the right hand corner like that.

2810
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:13.440
That shit is all just renovation.

2811
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:16.200
That's not what the feet originally looked like.

2812
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:16.890
What is it?

2813
01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:17.730
What do they go over it?

2814
01:13:17.731 --> 01:13:18.960
See all those little bricks?

2815
01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:19.740
Yeah,

2816
01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:20.130
the,

2817
01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:23.090
it was originally carved out of one unique set of stone.

2818
01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:23.340
Oh,

2819
01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:24.590
they're just putting new brick song.

2820
01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:25.051
Yes.

2821
01:13:25.051 --> 01:13:26.190
There's smoothing it all out.

2822
01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:28.050
It was what's called a Yardang.

2823
01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.460
What a Yardang is,

2824
01:13:29.461 --> 01:13:32.580
is something that comes up out of the desert and then they shape it.

2825
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:33.310
It's like,

2826
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:33.500
um,

2827
01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.910
it comes up out of the ground like a rock structure.

2828
01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:37.210
Would it bricks?

2829
01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:38.713
Exactly.

2830
01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:39.240
Oh,

2831
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.110
it's so stupid.

2832
01:13:40.111 --> 01:13:40.944
Like bat back.

2833
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:42.420
See if you can get some other photos of it.

2834
01:13:42.421 --> 01:13:43.830
You could see the food it was like before.

2835
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:44.551
Yeah.

2836
01:13:44.551 --> 01:13:45.384
See if there's that,

2837
01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:50.280
but there's a full image of the Sphinx where you could see it from a distance

2838
01:13:50.281 --> 01:13:50.760
and you can,

2839
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.580
you get a real sense of like that one,

2840
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:53.423
the right hand corner.

2841
01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:55.800
You get a real sense of what a travesty that is.

2842
01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.600
What they're doing is really kind of fucked up because what they're doing is

2843
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:01.733
it's just too bad.

2844
01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.060
They're making their own shit.

2845
01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:06.210
Like those feet are not the original Sphinx.

2846
01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.180
They're all smooth and bricks all over him.

2847
01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:12.350
The rest of the Sphinx used to be everything below the head,

2848
01:14:12.351 --> 01:14:13.240
all jacked up.

2849
01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:14.293
Fucked up.

2850
01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:16.720
Ward off some like demon or something?

2851
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:17.551
No,

2852
01:14:17.551 --> 01:14:17.831
no,

2853
01:14:17.831 --> 01:14:18.161
no.

2854
01:14:18.161 --> 01:14:18.971
Well the,

2855
01:14:18.971 --> 01:14:19.840
the thing,

2856
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:24.990
the thinking is rather that originally it was a lion and that one of those

2857
01:14:25.121 --> 01:14:25.840
pharaohs,

2858
01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.790
one of the Farrells was like fuck that line head shit in my head because they'll

2859
01:14:30.791 --> 01:14:32.890
face is fairly African.

2860
01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:35.480
So they believe that it took place after the Newbie.

2861
01:14:35.481 --> 01:14:40.481
Ian's conquered Egypt because there were two different types of people that were

2862
01:14:40.811 --> 01:14:41.740
ruling in Egypt.

2863
01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:43.570
The Sephardic people,

2864
01:14:43.571 --> 01:14:45.010
the original Egyptian people,

2865
01:14:45.011 --> 01:14:46.540
which are always depicted as,

2866
01:14:46.541 --> 01:14:46.840
you know,

2867
01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.100
like Arab looking folks.

2868
01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.700
Like Cleopatra was always depicted that way or you know,

2869
01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:53.050
Arabic a little bit.

2870
01:14:53.051 --> 01:14:53.271
Yeah,

2871
01:14:53.271 --> 01:14:55.900
I see dash well they actually look kind of strange,

2872
01:14:55.901 --> 01:14:56.201
you know,

2873
01:14:56.201 --> 01:14:59.380
like have you ever seen like what two ton common really looked like a recreation

2874
01:14:59.381 --> 01:15:00.170
of two ton common?

2875
01:15:00.170 --> 01:15:00.940
No.

2876
01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:01.241
Ooh,

2877
01:15:01.241 --> 01:15:02.074
it's weird,

2878
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.710
weird,

2879
01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:03.910
weird head man.

2880
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:04.820
He's got his,

2881
01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:05.110
uh,

2882
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:07.120
he had like an elongated skull.

2883
01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:10.840
His whole family had elongated skulls and they had,

2884
01:15:10.841 --> 01:15:11.674
um,

2885
01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:12.040
uh,

2886
01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.780
sculptures that were drawn of him.

2887
01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:14.710
That was what,

2888
01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:16.300
that was a recreation of what he looked like.

2889
01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:19.180
But that doesn't look as weird as when you see a side profile.

2890
01:15:19.290 --> 01:15:20.123
See if find out.

2891
01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.660
He died super young too.

2892
01:15:21.690 --> 01:15:22.130
I think he died.

2893
01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:22.963
Lexington like,

2894
01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:23.321
yeah,

2895
01:15:23.321 --> 01:15:24.820
like 17 or 18 or something.

2896
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:25.451
But like,

2897
01:15:25.451 --> 01:15:26.284
look at what it's

2898
01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:29.920
like they were freaks man.

2899
01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.073
Yeah.

2900
01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.650
And I don't remember who his father was.

2901
01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:37.000
See if you can find out who it's for.

2902
01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.530
I think his father was a,

2903
01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:39.640
I want to say taught Moses,

2904
01:15:39.641 --> 01:15:40.480
but I might be wrong,

2905
01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:44.380
but whoever his father was like a chicken from kids in the hall.

2906
01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.650
I'm knocking how cannot and yeah,

2907
01:15:47.651 --> 01:15:47.870
that's,

2908
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:48.703
that was what it was.

2909
01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:52.690
And [inaudible] had this very strangely shaped head and they have these

2910
01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:54.910
sculptures that were created of [inaudible] and I mean,

2911
01:15:54.911 --> 01:15:56.290
he looks like a God damn alien.

2912
01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:56.891
Look at,

2913
01:15:56.891 --> 01:15:57.340
look at it,

2914
01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:02.290
look at what he looked like because his fucking head and they don't know if

2915
01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:03.101
whether or not it was,

2916
01:16:03.101 --> 01:16:05.760
that was a result of head binding was.

2917
01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:07.150
That could be,

2918
01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:11.590
but it would also could be some weird genetic uh,

2919
01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:13.053
you know,

2920
01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:15.220
issue that some of those guys had.

2921
01:16:15.221 --> 01:16:17.800
And that's one of the reasons why they head bound in the first place to try to

2922
01:16:17.801 --> 01:16:18.634
recreate that.

2923
01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.073
Did it might've been,

2924
01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:20.771
you know,

2925
01:16:20.771 --> 01:16:22.660
like some people have strange slips,

2926
01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:23.840
some people at big jaws,

2927
01:16:23.841 --> 01:16:24.370
some people have,

2928
01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:24.810
you know,

2929
01:16:24.810 --> 01:16:28.630
they might've just naturally had weird shaped heads and they became bad

2930
01:16:28.631 --> 01:16:33.070
motherfuckers and then they all interbred there was a lot of that going on.

2931
01:16:33.071 --> 01:16:33.881
No royal blood,

2932
01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:37.840
fucking other royal blood or Florida state had a like that pump store maybe that

2933
01:16:37.841 --> 01:16:38.290
way.

2934
01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:38.490
Yeah,

2935
01:16:38.490 --> 01:16:39.700
it was all weird in the back.

2936
01:16:39.701 --> 01:16:42.990
It looked like the alien from above the head.

2937
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:43.301
Hold on.

2938
01:16:43.301 --> 01:16:44.134
What's that?

2939
01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.520
That's his real head.

2940
01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:47.373
Wow.

2941
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:49.930
That's two to uncommon.

2942
01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:52.060
Is that to done Kamara Ahca Naughton,

2943
01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:57.470
jpegs says it's knocking on was two ton common knocking on that.

2944
01:16:57.490 --> 01:16:58.360
Not the same guy.

2945
01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:00.820
That's a crazy fucking heads.

2946
01:17:00.821 --> 01:17:03.630
I'll look at this guy and it's like an extra three inches wide or a long run

2947
01:17:03.631 --> 01:17:03.910
there.

2948
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:04.750
Stop right there.

2949
01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:05.740
So strange.

2950
01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:09.740
So who was the dude that wasn't the store was a black one.

2951
01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:11.631
<v 1>Black Bob,</v>

2952
01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:11.871
sir.

2953
01:17:11.871 --> 01:17:12.350
His head.

2954
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:12.591
No,

2955
01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:13.160
it wasn't.

2956
01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:13.790
No,

2957
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:16.760
it was this black player they played with the Florida state that wants the pros.

2958
01:17:16.990 --> 01:17:18.230
Afterwards he shaved his head.

2959
01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:18.561
Fuck,

2960
01:17:18.561 --> 01:17:20.330
I forgot where he played and he had a crazy shape.

2961
01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:21.200
10 crazy shaped.

2962
01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:23.960
What would you do if you had a crazy shaped head and you had your head shaved my

2963
01:17:23.961 --> 01:17:24.440
head.

2964
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:25.273
But what have you had do?

2965
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:26.810
What if you're black and you're going bald?

2966
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:29.150
Black guys can't rock like this side.

2967
01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:29.511
Like,

2968
01:17:29.511 --> 01:17:29.990
uh,

2969
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.823
you know,

2970
01:17:30.970 --> 01:17:31.420
it doesn't,

2971
01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:31.670
you know,

2972
01:17:31.670 --> 01:17:35.030
I can't have to side here and bald on top of the Christmas wreath.

2973
01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:36.353
It doesn't look good.

2974
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:37.190
Yeah.

2975
01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:38.023
What do you do?

2976
01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:38.690
I don't know.

2977
01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:40.040
Do you think they do something about that?

2978
01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:43.130
They put like implants in there shaped the back of your head better?

2979
01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:44.443
No.

2980
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:46.160
Well think about all the shit that they do do.

2981
01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:49.370
Thinking about all the shit they do for like the straighten their hair.

2982
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:52.510
I read an article recently about South Korea and the,

2983
01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:52.581
uh,

2984
01:17:52.581 --> 01:17:53.810
the thing about Saudi Arabia,

2985
01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:54.650
oh my God,

2986
01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:55.520
it's crazy.

2987
01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:58.310
It's so common that I do it in China.

2988
01:17:58.311 --> 01:18:00.680
Two girls are getting their eyebrow eyeballs done.

2989
01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:01.750
It's like a rite of passage.

2990
01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:05.390
You got to cut them so you can have an overlap and you're on your eyebrows.

2991
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:07.100
Eyelashes,

2992
01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:07.880
whatever that's called.

2993
01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:08.713
I live,

2994
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:10.480
it's like ours fold over.

2995
01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:11.270
Oh yeah.

2996
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:12.380
There's don't fold over.

2997
01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:13.400
Oh Shit.

2998
01:18:13.401 --> 01:18:15.140
So they want to get him to look like they fold over.

2999
01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.610
So like at the surgery,

3000
01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:18.170
what did they look like with their eyes closed?

3001
01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:22.340
I think normal with her eyes closed and then when it's up it's like there's no

3002
01:18:22.341 --> 01:18:23.060
like lip,

3003
01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:24.740
you don't have to like folds over the top.

3004
01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:25.633
Yeah.

3005
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:27.290
In South Korea.

3006
01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.820
I think Bobby's mom got that surgery.

3007
01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:29.923
Bobby Lee,

3008
01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:30.853
she's Korean.

3009
01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:31.970
Boom boom.

3010
01:18:31.971 --> 01:18:32.650
That proves it.

3011
01:18:32.650 --> 01:18:33.770
Why does it Bobby get it done?

3012
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:34.601
How weird would that be?

3013
01:18:34.601 --> 01:18:36.230
False it and Bobby Lee and these crazy like,

3014
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.400
like what?

3015
01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:37.881
I'm weird.

3016
01:18:37.881 --> 01:18:38.714

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:17.710
Those all as implants?

3186
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:18.200
No,

3187
01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:19.000
they don't want any of them.

3188
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:19.960
I don't need directions.

3189
01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:25.170
Probably South Korean woman have become so immersed in western celebrity culture

3190
01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:26.830
that double eyelid surgery,

3191
01:23:26.831 --> 01:23:27.610
that's what it's called.

3192
01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:29.320
Which creates the Caucasian crease.

3193
01:23:29.321 --> 01:23:30.940
Many Asians don't naturally have,

3194
01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:34.780
has become as common as going to the dentist.

3195
01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:36.250
Wow.

3196
01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:36.521
Okay.

3197
01:23:36.521 --> 01:23:40.030
I got to go to sleep common as I owing to the dentist.

3198
01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:40.691
Think about that.

3199
01:23:40.691 --> 01:23:41.710
I want you to jerk off.

3200
01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:45.580
Think about plastic surgery in South Korea.

3201
01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:46.241
Meanwhile,

3202
01:23:46.241 --> 01:23:47.140
the doctor that does it.

3203
01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:48.313
Yeah.

3204
01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.900
Agents fuck looking.

3205
01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:50.813
Yeah.

3206
01:23:50.890 --> 01:23:51.760
Can't do it to themselves.

3207
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:52.120
Nope.

3208
01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:52.660
There's not one.

3209
01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:53.560
He's not interested in trust.

3210
01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:54.940
Anyone else with lesser talent than hips?

3211
01:23:54.941 --> 01:23:55.810
Like this is stupid.

3212
01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:56.943
These people are crazy.

3213
01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:58.420
There's no reason for it.

3214
01:23:58.421 --> 01:23:59.830
I got to take the training with blend in.

3215
01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:00.521
Debunked.

3216
01:24:00.521 --> 01:24:01.360
It's debunked.

3217
01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:04.660
You rang untrue to me.

3218
01:24:04.770 --> 01:24:04.931
Well,

3219
01:24:04.931 --> 01:24:05.764
I don't like that.

3220
01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:07.031
I don't like it.

3221
01:24:07.031 --> 01:24:07.781
It's probably false.

3222
01:24:07.781 --> 01:24:09.010
I feel like I just got ripped off.

3223
01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:09.791
What would you,

3224
01:24:09.791 --> 01:24:10.960
what did you get that from?

3225
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:11.823
What debunked it?

3226
01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:16.210
The way he was quoting to casually of the way with a good looking man like me

3227
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:17.650
and probably right.

3228
01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:18.883
Dammit.

3229
01:24:19.170 --> 01:24:21.400
Mother fuckers a arch fear.

3230
01:24:21.401 --> 01:24:22.240
Where can a,

3231
01:24:22.241 --> 01:24:22.781
the the,

3232
01:24:22.781 --> 01:24:24.820
the ladies and gentlemen see you doing your stand up?

3233
01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:25.270
Well,

3234
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:28.600
I'll be in Calgary and a September,

3235
01:24:28.601 --> 01:24:31.270
middle of the temporary Yucky ox and I guess I'll be in Chicago.

3236
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:32.320
Calgary Yuk.

3237
01:24:32.321 --> 01:24:35.350
Yuks I heard was one day on the 26th Calgary's fun dude.

3238
01:24:35.410 --> 01:24:35.990
Oh yeah,

3239
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.823
it's great.

3240
01:24:37.050 --> 01:24:38.380
You do Calgary with me.

3241
01:24:38.381 --> 01:24:40.890
Do we do times a few times there.

3242
01:24:41.050 --> 01:24:42.100
Those are fucking animals.

3243
01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:43.593
My rise.

3244
01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:45.220
It's chucks.

3245
01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:46.570
Even like two years he was like,

3246
01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:47.981
you sold out.

3247
01:24:47.981 --> 01:24:51.280
But like you had this trouble selling out that place and next year no press sold

3248
01:24:51.281 --> 01:24:52.114
out two shows.

3249
01:24:52.150 --> 01:24:53.080
Oh that's right,

3250
01:24:53.081 --> 01:24:53.820
that's right.

3251
01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:55.180
They'll get people behind us.

3252
01:24:55.181 --> 01:24:56.770
Remember Jacques Singer?

3253
01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:57.341
Jazz singer.

3254
01:24:57.341 --> 01:24:57.970
Yeah.

3255
01:24:57.970 --> 01:24:58.651
That was crazy.

3256
01:24:58.651 --> 01:25:00.930
As people behind us remember like they were up above.

3257
01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:01.770
Oh yeah.

3258
01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:05.010
Turn around and wave to him like I was that,

3259
01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:05.440
that one.

3260
01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:05.890
Yeah.

3261
01:25:05.890 --> 01:25:08.650
That was also the place where the oversold it and they didn't know what to do.

3262
01:25:08.651 --> 01:25:12.190
So they put seats on the stage on the stage.

3263
01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:12.960
That's what I mean.

3264
01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:13.301
Remember?

3265
01:25:13.301 --> 01:25:13.780
Yeah.

3266
01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:14.660
And like the giants,

3267
01:25:14.661 --> 01:25:15.760
they don't need all that room,

3268
01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:17.110
but they were going to not do it.

3269
01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.450
They were going to give those people their money back and send them home.

3270
01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:21.550
And so I said,

3271
01:25:21.610 --> 01:25:21.970
well,

3272
01:25:21.970 --> 01:25:23.740
you know I don't like,

3273
01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:24.850
that's okay.

3274
01:25:24.850 --> 01:25:26.260
Like you want to see them on the stage,

3275
01:25:26.261 --> 01:25:29.210
you can see them on the stage and so there was like a pow in a meeting and they

3276
01:25:29.211 --> 01:25:29.291
go,

3277
01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:29.501
okay,

3278
01:25:29.501 --> 01:25:30.130
we're going to see,

3279
01:25:30.130 --> 01:25:32.950
we're going to put the seats in our chairs out there and there was like 200

3280
01:25:32.951 --> 01:25:34.140
fucking people on the stage.

3281
01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:35.021
Canadian unions,

3282
01:25:35.021 --> 01:25:36.630
they finally got that shit set up in no time.

3283
01:25:36.690 --> 01:25:37.361
We're on the stage.

3284
01:25:37.361 --> 01:25:38.880
There's a lot of God damn people on the stage.

3285
01:25:38.890 --> 01:25:42.430
It was maybe 200 there was mad on the stage.

3286
01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:43.271
That was fun,

3287
01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:43.720
man.

3288
01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.553
Calgary's good.

3289
01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:46.600
Those towns like Edmonton,

3290
01:25:46.601 --> 01:25:47.081
Calgary,

3291
01:25:47.081 --> 01:25:48.390
like there's a lot of oil money.

3292
01:25:48.450 --> 01:25:50.010
Those folks have a lot of oil money.

3293
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:51.220
How to party and they party.

3294
01:25:51.490 --> 01:25:52.390
They party hard.

3295
01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:53.590
They go hard.

3296
01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:54.400
Yeah,

3297
01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.020
we did a Lloydminster.

3298
01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.660
Lloydminster is like a mining town.

3299
01:25:58.661 --> 01:26:00.700
The early hours from Edmonton.

3300
01:26:00.730 --> 01:26:01.240
That's cool.

3301
01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:01.391
Yeah.

3302
01:26:01.391 --> 01:26:02.200
It's like they look,

3303
01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.380
they look at Edmonton like all look at him open this.

3304
01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:05.481
Ha ha ha.

3305
01:26:05.481 --> 01:26:05.841
Yeah.

3306
01:26:05.841 --> 01:26:06.320
We were on,

3307
01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.960
we did a show in a hockey rink.

3308
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.390
Really?

3309
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.760
Yeah.

3310
01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:14.450
Callen Tony Hinchcliffe in me in a hockey rink in Lloydminster at a great

3311
01:26:14.451 --> 01:26:15.284
fucking time.

3312
01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:16.790
Sound system was kind of dog shit.

3313
01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:18.350
It was what threw me off a little bit.

3314
01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:22.580
It was tough because it was echoing a lot and I was on the side when Collin was

3315
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:23.930
onstage and clear,

3316
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.823
I couldn't hear him.

3317
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:25.310
Damn.

3318
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:28.040
I was on the side and I could barely understand what he's saying and I knew his

3319
01:26:28.041 --> 01:26:30.440
act and the people at the front got it.

3320
01:26:30.441 --> 01:26:30.770
Good.

3321
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:31.231
Fuck yeah.

3322
01:26:31.231 --> 01:26:32.064
Had manners.

3323
01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:32.440
No,

3324
01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:33.470
the crowds here already could have a good time.

3325
01:26:33.471 --> 01:26:33.681
It's like,

3326
01:26:33.681 --> 01:26:36.770
I know and you're not making them have as good a time as good a time as they

3327
01:26:36.771 --> 01:26:37.070
could.

3328
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:38.930
All they had to do was set it up a little bit better,

3329
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:40.700
put speakers in some different areas,

3330
01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.860
but now we know they don't do shows up there.

3331
01:26:42.861 --> 01:26:43.010
Yeah.

3332
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:43.371
That's the thing.

3333
01:26:43.371 --> 01:26:44.204
They're trying to figure it out.

3334
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:45.190
Yeah.

3335
01:26:45.190 --> 01:26:46.040
You met Harvey,

3336
01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:46.941
the promoter guy.

3337
01:26:46.941 --> 01:26:47.510
Yeah.

3338
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:48.343
He's a good dude.

3339
01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:49.040
So we,

3340
01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.030
we did it up there with him.

3341
01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:50.840
All right.

3342
01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.400
This fucking shows over are you should fear.

3343
01:26:52.401 --> 01:26:55.160
This is the second of two podcasts we did today,

3344
01:26:55.810 --> 01:26:56.110
man.

3345
01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:56.930
It's crazy.

3346
01:26:56.930 --> 01:26:57.570
Brothers was,

3347
01:26:57.570 --> 01:26:57.960
hey,

3348
01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:58.850
I sold that couch.

3349
01:26:58.851 --> 01:27:00.300
So we've got to go to dinner sometimes too.

3350
01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:05.300
Original couch from the original Joe Rogan experience podcast.

3351
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:07.100
I gave it to Ari years ago.

3352
01:27:07.101 --> 01:27:10.040
He kept it in as a park ranger was the nicest thing in my apartment for five

3353
01:27:10.041 --> 01:27:10.251
years.

3354
01:27:10.251 --> 01:27:11.084
Easy.

3355
01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:12.373
Ah,

3356
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:13.930
very nice couch.

3357
01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:15.051
And so,

3358
01:27:15.051 --> 01:27:15.500
uh,

3359
01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:16.580
then some dude bought it.

3360
01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.540
Yeah.

3361
01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:18.560
How much you got for that fucking thing?

3362
01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:19.730
40 bucks.

3363
01:27:19.730 --> 01:27:20.563
Holy Shit.

3364
01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:21.930
Iba.

3365
01:27:21.930 --> 01:27:22.350
Two,

3366
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:23.750
let's go to like a Morton's.

3367
01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:24.010
Yeah,

3368
01:27:24.010 --> 01:27:26.090
some really nice glass of wine.

3369
01:27:26.091 --> 01:27:26.924
Like gentlemen.

3370
01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:27.231
All right,

3371
01:27:27.231 --> 01:27:28.020
let's do it.

3372
01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:28.730
Alright,

3373
01:27:28.730 --> 01:27:30.110
follow Ari on Twitter.

3374
01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:31.070
Ari Shaffir,

3375
01:27:31.071 --> 01:27:32.270
a r I.

3376
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.601
S h,

3377
01:27:32.601 --> 01:27:33.140
a f,

3378
01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:33.380
f.

3379
01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.090
I.

3380
01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:35.090
R.

3381
01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:35.150
M.

3382
01:27:35.150 --> 01:27:37.820
And you can also get his standup comedy.

3383
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:38.321
What is you,

3384
01:27:38.321 --> 01:27:42.350
you have to stand up comedy cds that are available to comedy specials that are

3385
01:27:42.351 --> 01:27:42.930
available.

3386
01:27:42.930 --> 01:27:45.110
One that chill went down so it passes the guess if,

3387
01:27:45.111 --> 01:27:46.820
I guess comedy central's going to put it up.

3388
01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:47.011
Well,

3389
01:27:47.011 --> 01:27:49.190
I went down chill the website that did mine,

3390
01:27:49.191 --> 01:27:50.240
and Maria's improves as,

3391
01:27:50.241 --> 01:27:51.830
she can't buy it anywhere to buy it right now.

3392
01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.130
So revenge for the Holocaust is still out,

3393
01:27:55.131 --> 01:27:56.540
but there are illegal downloads.

3394
01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:57.670
Oh good.

3395
01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:02.270
You go to views player and put in passive aggressive or should fear,

3396
01:28:02.271 --> 01:28:03.770
you could probably find a seed for it,

3397
01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:06.170
but revenge for the Holocaust is to cds out.

3398
01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:06.480
Yes.

3399
01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.040
That's out.

3400
01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.720
And the other one is not out.

3401
01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:09.590
Not Out.

3402
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:10.430
God Damn.

3403
01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:11.210
Yeah.

3404
01:28:11.210 --> 01:28:11.931
Passive aggressive.

3405
01:28:11.931 --> 01:28:13.160
It's just out there in the ether somewhere.

3406
01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:14.270
We're getting it up.

3407
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:15.051
So you get put,

3408
01:28:15.051 --> 01:28:17.620
but right now they've got the green light to hit the torrents.

3409
01:28:17.621 --> 01:28:18.320
Yeah.

3410
01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.041
Oh absolutely.

3411
01:28:19.041 --> 01:28:19.780
The full green light.

3412
01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:20.490
Powerful Greenland.

3413
01:28:20.490 --> 01:28:20.870
All right.

3414
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.991
Oh,

3415
01:28:20.991 --> 01:28:22.310
and I have a story to tell or show on Monday.

3416
01:28:22.410 --> 01:28:22.710
Oh,

3417
01:28:22.710 --> 01:28:23.211
union hall.

3418
01:28:23.211 --> 01:28:24.650
But there's only like 40 seats.

3419
01:28:24.651 --> 01:28:25.450
So New York.

3420
01:28:25.450 --> 01:28:25.700
Yeah,

3421
01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:26.220
New York.

3422
01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:26.391
Oh,

3423
01:28:26.391 --> 01:28:26.890
beautiful.

3424
01:28:26.890 --> 01:28:27.723
Pat's doing it.

3425
01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:28.401
Oh Shit.

3426
01:28:28.401 --> 01:28:29.750
Ms Paths going to be on the podcast.

3427

You're going to love it.

3431
01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:32.511

01:28:36.990 --> 01:28:38.150

3446
01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:50.960
This is an awesome day.

3447

Alright.

3448
01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:51.801
