<v Speaker 3>See what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a laugh at the guy's face and </v>

119
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.780
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying,</v>

120
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.830
<v Speaker 3>but to me it's a dude just shot a load </v>
<v Speaker 3>on me and I can't deal with it.</v>

121
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:16.990
<v Speaker 3>I can deal with the dude pissing on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an act of aggression.</v>

122
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 3>A guy shooting a load on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

123
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 3>that guy basically just fucked me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

124
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 3>It just snapped from below.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

125
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:26.620
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's just an accident.</v>

126
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.950
<v Speaker 3>He's marking me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So an accident is how you usually market</v>

127
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 3>animals usually use Peter Marks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>

128
00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:35.380
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

129
00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:37.320
<v Speaker 3>that's an act of aggression and act of </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggression.</v>

130
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 3>Urinating on me would not offend me </v>
<v Speaker 3>nearly as much as dropping a load on me.</v>

131
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 3>That's just me though.</v>

132
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.970
<v Speaker 3>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things that I don't really think of.</v>

133
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 3>What if it feels a long beard?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

134
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Asparagus,</v>

135
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:53.500
<v Speaker 3>pis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four hours sitting in Yankee stadium,</v>

136
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.640
<v Speaker 3>drinking beer in the hot sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not.</v>

137
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 3>You're not a sports fan</v>

138
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

139
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 4>The only sport I was good at besides a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mixed martial arts and boxing is pool.</v>

140
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.830
<v Speaker 4>I watched professional pool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is completely.</v>

141
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.180
<v Speaker 2>I actually am watching the NBA finals </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have to have the game on mute </v>

142
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 2>because I'm convinced the announcers </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate my team and I.</v>

143
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.840
<v Speaker 2>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets insane.</v>

144
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 4>Do people get so fucking mad if they </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel like someone's doing bias </v>

145
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.661
<v Speaker 4>commentary?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get so much shit from dudes who are </v>

146
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:27.150
<v Speaker 4>angry at me because I called the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As I see it,</v>

147
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.080
<v Speaker 4>I try to be as objective as possible and</v>
<v Speaker 4>have like no one's my favorite.</v>

148
00:06:31.081 --> 00:06:33.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't want anybody in particular when </v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want it to happen.</v>

149
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.690
<v Speaker 4>I have a bunch of guys that I love </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching when they fight because they're</v>

150
00:06:36.691 --> 00:06:37.890
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't,</v>

151
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.390
<v Speaker 4>I try to never like root for somebody so</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do my best to stay objective,</v>

152
00:06:42.391 --> 00:06:42.570
<v Speaker 4>but I</v>

153
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.710
<v Speaker 2>cold like a fucking see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some tooth kid crazy just because </v>

154
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 2>they're so emotionally invested like me </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Celtics.</v>

155
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.610
<v Speaker 2>I want them to win and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

156
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:54.560
<v Speaker 2>like I haven't gotten invited to hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on down and watch,</v>

157
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.240
<v Speaker 2>watch game seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I can't,</v>

158
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.750
<v Speaker 2>I can't fucking deal with all these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to sit there by myself and I </v>

159
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.551
<v Speaker 2>have to watch it on mute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't be around a bunch of other </v>

160
00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:07.901
<v Speaker 2>people because there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>people there who don't give a fuck or </v>

161
00:07:07.901 --> 00:07:11.200
<v Speaker 2>they or they're going to be rooting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>another team and I will literally have </v>

162
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.160
<v Speaker 2>rage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

163
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I've really been examining it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what's silly?</v>

164
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:20.110
<v Speaker 2>It is silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard somebody told me that I think </v>

165
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.480
<v Speaker 2>Jay Leno said was I wasn't into sports </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was just like,</v>

166
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:25.481
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do I care if the peanuts beat the </v>

167
00:07:25.481 --> 00:07:25.481
<v Speaker 2>Kangaroos and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

168
00:07:25.481 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 2>And it just really sort of was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

169
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:28.490
<v Speaker 2>why do I give a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a trick.</v>

170
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 2>People think that that the NBA finals </v>
<v Speaker 2>are rigged.</v>

171
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Like the Kardashians going on tmz saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing is rigged is going on.</v>

172
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Kim Kardashians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert Kardashian.</v>

173
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Robert Carnegie I think is the brother </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Kim and he's like going on saying </v>

174
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.000
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

175
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.250
<v Speaker 2>the source that family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys.</v>

176
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.980
<v Speaker 2>And so they got to reexamine the Warren </v>
<v Speaker 2>Commission next,</v>

177
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 2>take another peek at the Zapruder film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

178
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:58.300
<v Speaker 2>Really the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the conditions looked into the moon </v>

179
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.331
<v Speaker 2>landing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't somebody off that in the </v>

180
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:01.331
<v Speaker 2>Kardashians?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Married to an NBA player though.</v>

181
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:01.590
<v Speaker 2>There were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

182
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:06.670
<v Speaker 2>that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the NBA also had a ref that got </v>

183
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:06.740
<v Speaker 2>busted with mob ties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I love how they acted.</v>

184
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:09.740
<v Speaker 2>Like he was the only one I was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

185
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.580
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't notice that if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Refereeing with them is 10 everybody up.</v>

186
00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:14.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if,</v>

187
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:16.910
<v Speaker 2>if he bet the under and everybody's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>falling out.</v>

188
00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I know that's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>exaggeration.</v>

189
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Every one of the easiest</v>

190
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.420
<v Speaker 4>games to fix,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

191
00:08:21.421 --> 00:08:23.160
<v Speaker 4>they had a problem with that with </v>
<v Speaker 4>professional pool,</v>

192
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.280
<v Speaker 4>with professional pool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only one time that a sports book </v>

193
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.060
<v Speaker 4>ever put a line on the event,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget what casino was in it,</v>

194
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 4>it was at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was in vegas and it was a big </v>

195
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 4>tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These guys are grinding.</v>

196
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 4>They're out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

197
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:36.810
<v Speaker 4>professional pool player,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't make much money,</v>

198
00:08:36.811 --> 00:08:38.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even the best in the world.</v>

199
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.720
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

200
00:08:39.721 --> 00:08:41.530
<v Speaker 4>there was an underdog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This Guy Mike Lebron,</v>

201
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:43.980
<v Speaker 4>he hadn't won a big tournament like that</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a long time.</v>

202
00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:45.360
<v Speaker 4>So they all got together and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey Mike,</v>

203
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.470
<v Speaker 4>Guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're one of the tournament,</v>

204
00:08:46.471 --> 00:08:51.471
<v Speaker 4>we're going to fucking bet on you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they all threw in and everybody </v>

205
00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:51.471
<v Speaker 4>dumped and they all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all dumped.</v>

206
00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:51.540
<v Speaker 4>Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lebron won.</v>

207
00:08:51.541 --> 00:08:54.420
<v Speaker 4>They cleaned up and the bookies never </v>
<v Speaker 4>put a line on pool again.</v>

208
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

209
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:56.170
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

210
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they obviously figured it out.</v>

211
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh fucking everybody knew their driving </v>
<v Speaker 4>balls into the rail.</v>

212
00:09:00.921 --> 00:09:02.720
<v Speaker 4>They're fucking supposed to get out ball</v>
<v Speaker 4>in hand.</v>

213
00:09:02.721 --> 00:09:04.010
<v Speaker 4>They don't get out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They scratch,</v>

214
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a bunch of shots were digital.</v>

215
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:09.950
<v Speaker 4>They will obviously bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you know,</v>

216
00:09:09.951 --> 00:09:14.951
<v Speaker 4>they do their best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but these guys a high level pros don't </v>

217
00:09:14.951 --> 00:09:14.951
<v Speaker 4>miss very often,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

218
00:09:14.951 --> 00:09:19.570
<v Speaker 4>so they can fuck up and take a bad path </v>
<v Speaker 4>on purpose and a path that gives them a </v>

219
00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.720
<v Speaker 4>high percentage of getting stuck behind </v>
<v Speaker 4>balls or something like that.</v>

220
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.120
<v Speaker 4>So they make errors on purpose and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at it and you're like,</v>

221
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.890
<v Speaker 4>why the fuck would that guy play that </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that?</v>

222
00:09:24.891 --> 00:09:27.470
<v Speaker 4>Like this guy's a top of the food chain </v>
<v Speaker 4>world champion,</v>

223
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.240
<v Speaker 4>a snooker player got busted recently for</v>
<v Speaker 4>a taking a 300,</v>

224
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.770
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>300,000</v>

225
00:09:33.771 --> 00:09:38.770
<v Speaker 4>euro bribe who's taken a bribe to a to </v>
<v Speaker 4>dump a bunch of matches and this guy was</v>

226
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.010
<v Speaker 4>like one of the very best in the world.</v>

227
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.680
<v Speaker 4>He's like a top line and snooker players</v>
<v Speaker 4>make big bank.</v>

228
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:47.090
<v Speaker 4>But apparently it's accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was his vice money?</v>

229
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.460
<v Speaker 4>Took it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want the money.</v>

230
00:09:49.461 --> 00:09:50.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

231
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.560
<v Speaker 4>he said that they've done it before and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

232
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.320
<v Speaker 4>they got this guy on hidden camera and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

233
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.720
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty devastating for the whole sneaker</v>

234
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:58.270
<v Speaker 4>community because he's like one of their</v>
<v Speaker 4>starburst,</v>

235
00:09:58.271 --> 00:10:01.040
<v Speaker 4>but all eight people who are in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>community over there,</v>

236
00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:03.740
<v Speaker 4>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't understand and giant snickers,</v>

237
00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:05.060
<v Speaker 4>this crazy game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like pool,</v>

238
00:10:05.061 --> 00:10:10.061
<v Speaker 4>but it's played on a giant table at 12 </v>
<v Speaker 4>by six and the pockets are really small </v>

239
00:10:10.061 --> 00:10:14.951
<v Speaker 4>and the balls are really small and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're colored and I don't know the </v>

240
00:10:14.951 --> 00:10:17.651
<v Speaker 4>exact with mushrooms on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not from the 70 percent of that </v>

241
00:10:17.651 --> 00:10:19.220
<v Speaker 4>bumper pool or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do remember bumper pull.</v>

242
00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:20.420
<v Speaker 4>That shit was ridiculous.</v>

243
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.460
<v Speaker 4>They had like little mushroom trees or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something in the middle.</v>

244
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.710
<v Speaker 4>Little rubber ones to bounce it off it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you didn't have space for a real</v>

245
00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:32.711
<v Speaker 4>table,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you get one of these goofy fucking </v>

246
00:10:32.711 --> 00:10:32.711
<v Speaker 4>things was only 10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had to make it more difficult.</v>

247
00:10:32.711 --> 00:10:32.711
<v Speaker 4>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

248
00:10:32.711 --> 00:10:37.001
<v Speaker 4>That was the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody put some sort of reference to </v>

249
00:10:37.001 --> 00:10:40.661
<v Speaker 4>drugs right on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pool has always had a problem with </v>

250
00:10:40.661 --> 00:10:42.170
<v Speaker 4>people gambling dumping money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like a common thing amongst,</v>

251
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.200
<v Speaker 4>amongst guys who bet like guys will back</v>
<v Speaker 4>pool players and the pool players were </v>

252
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.350
<v Speaker 4>dumping and cut up the money because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they know where they're going to win,</v>

253
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that whole world,</v>

254
00:10:50.481 --> 00:10:55.481
<v Speaker 4>the world of gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you get gambling involved with </v>

255
00:10:55.481 --> 00:10:55.481
<v Speaker 4>anything and there's a lot of gambling </v>
<v Speaker 4>on pro basketball,</v>

256
00:10:55.481 --> 00:10:57.440
<v Speaker 4>I would just assume it's rigged,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't you?</v>

257
00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

258
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think uh,</v>

259
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:05.900
<v Speaker 2>well I think the players make too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>money and so it's very hard like that.</v>

260
00:11:05.901 --> 00:11:08.750
<v Speaker 2>And the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way to definitely do it is some sort</v>

261
00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:13.751
<v Speaker 2>of authority figure on the court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like know referee and umpire or </v>

262
00:11:13.751 --> 00:11:13.910
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Given band halls.</v>

263
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.930
<v Speaker 2>I went to the game when a Kevin Garnett </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt his knee against Utah,</v>

264
00:11:17.931 --> 00:11:21.380
<v Speaker 2>which I'm sure you still have on </v>
<v Speaker 2>videotape essentially talking about poop</v>

265
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.030
<v Speaker 2>fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know those humans.</v>

266
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:27.920
<v Speaker 2>The referees were literally dictating </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pace of the game and it made like,</v>

267
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.010
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to equate it to what you do.</v>

268
00:11:31.011 --> 00:11:36.011
<v Speaker 2>Be like a guy had no stand up and all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sudden he was great at stand up and </v>

269
00:11:36.011 --> 00:11:36.470
<v Speaker 2>then five seconds later again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

270
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:37.470
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would,</v>

271
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.540
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be.</v>

272
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will call and everything.</v>

273
00:11:41.631 --> 00:11:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

274
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.090
<v Speaker 2>And then you could just see them loosen </v>
<v Speaker 2>up the reins.</v>

275
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Then a guy would like literally take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude's head off and they just had no </v>

276
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:49.120
<v Speaker 2>blood no foul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden it was like,</v>

277
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 2>did these guys bet as us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like they bet like a </v>

278
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.640
<v Speaker 2>specific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was,</v>

279
00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:56.620
<v Speaker 2>but it was one of the weirdest called </v>
<v Speaker 2>Games</v>

280
00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.160
<v Speaker 4>hasn't been busted for that though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

281
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.050
<v Speaker 4>Referees have been busted for doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

282
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had,</v>

283
00:12:02.131 --> 00:12:04.730
<v Speaker 2>they had that referee and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure if,</v>

284
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.660
<v Speaker 2>if other ones got busted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they kept it quiet.</v>

285
00:12:06.661 --> 00:12:09.960
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea as usual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have like one story and then EPA comes</v>

286
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spread it out over every sport to start </v>

287
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 2>pontificating,</v>

288
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.180
<v Speaker 4>more interested in conspiracy theorists </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I know because Bill Burr,</v>

289
00:12:19.181 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 4>you'll start talking to him about it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then five minutes and he'll.</v>

290
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.070
<v Speaker 4>He'll admit that he doesn't know what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck he's talking about.</v>

291
00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:25.750
<v Speaker 4>He saw a youtube video like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's this?</v>

292
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.070
<v Speaker 4>What's up with this gps?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm one of the people.</v>

293
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.050
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't use GPS.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I called him to give him directions.</v>

294
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got gps thinking,</v>

295
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:33.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to give him my address.</v>

296
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a Thomas Guide,</v>

297
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:41.320
<v Speaker 2>fucking Thomas Guide like a goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 2>pioneer and like a pencil and eraser and</v>

298
00:12:41.321 --> 00:12:43.210
<v Speaker 2>you're like putting compass like </v>
<v Speaker 2>directions on.</v>

299
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:45.250
<v Speaker 2>So you guys are acting like I'm churning</v>
<v Speaker 2>butter.</v>

300
00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:47.890
<v Speaker 2>You guys both had one like fucking five </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

301
00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:48.990
<v Speaker 2>Didn't show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

302
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Well I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get here.</v>

303
00:12:50.081 --> 00:12:51.990
<v Speaker 2>I was on the issue</v>

304
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.380
<v Speaker 4>early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early on with the GPS.</v>

305
00:12:55.381 --> 00:12:59.610
<v Speaker 4>I had the first gps was a CD based GPS.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was cd rom base,</v>

306
00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:01.440
<v Speaker 4>so it only.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I only had a map of Los Angeles.</v>

307
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.900
<v Speaker 2>I've never even used those books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I've just always used like </v>

308
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.961
<v Speaker 2>mapquest and stuff and maybe before that</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom would like write down the </v>

309
00:13:09.961 --> 00:13:12.721
<v Speaker 2>directions on like a Napkin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I first moved here I had it </v>

310
00:13:12.721 --> 00:13:14.390
<v Speaker 2>written down on an envelope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get here.</v>

311
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.040
<v Speaker 2>There was no problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very easy when I first moved to La,</v>

312
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.340
<v Speaker 2>but I haven't had one a long time for </v>
<v Speaker 2>la.</v>

313
00:13:21.341 --> 00:13:23.560
<v Speaker 2>That just seems impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is impossible.</v>

314
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:24.970
<v Speaker 2>There's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to think,</v>

315
00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:29.971
<v Speaker 2>don't use your brand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let the computer do a British woman </v>

316
00:13:29.971 --> 00:13:30.010
<v Speaker 2>telling me what to do.</v>

317
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.910
<v Speaker 4>GPS,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think the GPS is possibly dangerous?</v>

318
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.760
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a waste of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then also one of my many non researched </v>

319
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.880
<v Speaker 2>opinions is I just don't like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the fact that there's some sort of.</v>

320
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.880
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno what they beam a signal up to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>satellite.</v>

321
00:13:47.881 --> 00:13:52.881
<v Speaker 2>It Burns back down through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere and into my fucking car and </v>

322
00:13:52.881 --> 00:13:53.820
<v Speaker 2>then somebody talking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

323
00:13:53.821 --> 00:13:57.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it doesn't mean anything out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it just is like a receipt like a</v>

324
00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.410
<v Speaker 2>at you and it picks up what it's being </v>
<v Speaker 2>beamed at.</v>

325
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.840
<v Speaker 2>You as the time of that say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

326
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want stuff always beamed at me.</v>

327
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:11.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting it no matter what you're </v>

328
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:11.940
<v Speaker 2>getting right now you're getting into</v>

329
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.840
<v Speaker 4>see that if you receive it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a beam coming at you.</v>

330
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.760
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there's something to receive it,</v>

331
00:14:16.761 --> 00:14:19.660
<v Speaker 4>like a box,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some sort of gps box car,</v>

332
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.490
<v Speaker 4>but all that's doing is receiving </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's already there.</v>

333
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.160
<v Speaker 4>If your brand is going to be affected by</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

334
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.880
<v Speaker 4>it's getting effected by what's already </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

335
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.000
<v Speaker 2>No matter of the box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys don't.</v>

336
00:14:28.001 --> 00:14:28.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

337
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.840
<v Speaker 2>I have led.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've led on the inside of my thing.</v>

338
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:35.870
<v Speaker 2>You guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to die earlier because you </v>

339
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.870
<v Speaker 2>guys don't want to fucking use a Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 2>Guide.</v>

340
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:38.180
<v Speaker 4>Why would you think the GPS would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous though?</v>

341
00:14:38.181 --> 00:14:40.640
<v Speaker 4>It's like the radio being dangerous or </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's Wifi.</v>

342
00:14:40.641 --> 00:14:42.450
<v Speaker 4>We're doing this word broadcast in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shelters.</v>

343
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:43.110
<v Speaker 4>Big</v>

344
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.980
<v Speaker 2>bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're drinking now.</v>

345
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.330
<v Speaker 2>It's more dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

346
00:14:45.331 --> 00:14:48.690
<v Speaker 2>If you leave in classic Bar Room Point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 4>your car and it gets really hot out,</v>

357
00:15:12.921 --> 00:15:14.850

<v Speaker 2>the chemicals are in the plastic.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

360

<v Speaker 2>don't agree with that dude.</v>

361
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.900

00:15:55.191 --> 00:15:55.790
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:09.020
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and you're still out </v>
<v Speaker 2>partying and it's just like,</v>

379
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.950
<v Speaker 2>it's just one of those fucking people </v>
<v Speaker 2>just because you have a kid,</v>

380
00:16:12.951 --> 00:16:15.170
<v Speaker 2>they think that automatically makes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible.</v>

381
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:17.380
<v Speaker 2>You're still a fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have.</v>

383
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's really funny is the nobility that</v>

384
00:16:21.861 --> 00:16:26.861
<v Speaker 4>they attach to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is coming from someone who has </v>

385
00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:28.811
<v Speaker 4>two children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I used to get so annoyed when I </v>

386
00:16:28.811 --> 00:16:30.050
<v Speaker 4>would talk to people who had kids and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would compare their life to my life</v>

387
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:30.830
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

388
00:16:30.831 --> 00:16:31.610
<v Speaker 4>well look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

389
00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:33.530
<v Speaker 4>you're just a single guy just running </v>
<v Speaker 4>around being the same.</v>

390
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.830
<v Speaker 4>But what the fuck do we have to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>people?</v>

391
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:38.960
<v Speaker 4>Is there a shortage of fucking human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings?</v>

392
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.880
<v Speaker 4>There's 6 billion of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

393
00:16:40.881 --> 00:16:45.881
<v Speaker 4>There's plenty of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not more noble because you're </v>

394
00:16:45.881 --> 00:16:45.881
<v Speaker 4>raising a person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I commend you for it.</v>

395
00:16:45.881 --> 00:16:46.660
<v Speaker 4>I hope you enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope you,</v>

396
00:16:46.661 --> 00:16:51.661
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really commit to it and you raise a </v>

397
00:16:51.661 --> 00:16:51.661
<v Speaker 4>good person that doesn't turn out to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>a fucking psycho,</v>

398
00:16:51.661 --> 00:16:53.210
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't make you a more noble </v>
<v Speaker 4>person because you have a child.</v>

399
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:58.211
<v Speaker 4>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them think that they're more </v>

400
00:16:58.211 --> 00:17:02.201
<v Speaker 4>just are doing the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not being silly with their life </v>

401
00:17:02.201 --> 00:17:02.201
<v Speaker 4>like it's so slow.</v>

402
00:17:02.201 --> 00:17:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Guy Really wanted to go out and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasted and he was jealous that I can </v>

403
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:11.180
<v Speaker 2>continue to live my sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lonely life sticking in your face.</v>

404
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.420
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>single person so that I.</v>

405
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.370
<v Speaker 2>But he's a good shit though because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>called him up the next day.</v>

406
00:17:15.371 --> 00:17:15.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>your front steps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking your dog down the street and you</v>

<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Snooker and you're giving me shit.</v>

411
00:17:34.021 --> 00:17:39.021
<v Speaker 4>The superfly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that he would get on the top </v>

412
00:17:39.021 --> 00:17:39.021
<v Speaker 4>row and all that scar tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Love you,</v>

413
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.990

<v Speaker 4>He did have that scar tissue.</v>

414
00:17:42.991 --> 00:17:45.780
<v Speaker 4>That's what the old school guys would </v>
<v Speaker 4>cut their own forehead to bleed.</v>

415
00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:46.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The Rock is somehow related to superfly </v>

419
00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:54.160
<v Speaker 2>snuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

423
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:06.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you turn out to be a </v>

424
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.070
<v Speaker 4>wrestler herself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

425
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.070
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy superfly snuck.</v>

426
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.830
<v Speaker 4>It was my favorite when I was in high </v>
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

427
00:18:06.831 --> 00:18:11.831
<v Speaker 4>He was my number one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bob backlund was pretty good because he </v>

428
00:18:11.831 --> 00:18:11.831
<v Speaker 4>had a real wrestling stance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I appreciated that.</v>

429
00:18:11.831 --> 00:18:13.310
<v Speaker 4>He went in there and looked like he </v>
<v Speaker 4>really knew how to wrestle.</v>

430
00:18:13.311 --> 00:18:14.840
<v Speaker 4>He would arm drag dudes and shit.</v>

431
00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of the characters.</v>

432
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.070
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a joke writer hate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a performer,</v>

433
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:26.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in there doing like the was a real </v>

434
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.430
<v Speaker 2>wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

435
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.850
<v Speaker 2>what really sucks about wrestlers </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling,</v>

436
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:31.940
<v Speaker 4>one of the toughest sports in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's no professional avenue for </v>

437
00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:31.940
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tried it,</v>

438
00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.930
<v Speaker 4>they tried to professional wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 4>league a few years back,</v>

439
00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:35.670
<v Speaker 4>but nobody wanted to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

440
00:18:35.671 --> 00:18:37.830
<v Speaker 4>it hasn't caught on when things haven't </v>
<v Speaker 4>caught on.</v>

441
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:41.220
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard to get them to catch on </v>
<v Speaker 4>unless it's something fucking crazy.</v>

442
00:18:41.221 --> 00:18:46.221
<v Speaker 4>Like mixed martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mixed martial arts is so crazy and so </v>

443
00:18:46.221 --> 00:18:46.221
<v Speaker 4>primal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ones that started getting on TV,</v>

444
00:18:46.221 --> 00:18:46.560
<v Speaker 4>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

445
00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:47.670
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

446
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.700
<v Speaker 4>it just gets everybody in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to get that from </v>

447
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.531
<v Speaker 4>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But wrestling is easily more exciting </v>

448
00:18:54.531 --> 00:18:54.531
<v Speaker 4>than a lot of sports that are already on</v>
<v Speaker 4>TV,</v>

449
00:18:54.531 --> 00:18:54.531
<v Speaker 4>including,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

450
00:18:54.531 --> 00:18:56.820
<v Speaker 4>soccer soccer's not as exciting as </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling to me.</v>

451
00:18:56.821 --> 00:18:58.340
<v Speaker 4>I would way rather watch like really </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

452
00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Well actually I can defend soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not American American soccer is like if </v>

453
00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:07.770

454
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.130
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible.</v>

455
00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:11.160
<v Speaker 2>But international level soccer is pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

456
00:19:11.161 --> 00:19:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because now you're dealing with like the</v>

00:19:31.321 --> 00:19:31.321
<v Speaker 2>Africa?</v>

464
00:19:31.321 --> 00:19:32.340
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget what country it is in Africa,</v>

465
00:19:32.341 --> 00:19:34.710
<v Speaker 4>but two people have been killed in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of,</v>

466
00:19:34.711 --> 00:19:39.711
<v Speaker 4>been arrested for watching the World Cup</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's like super extreme Muslim </v>

467
00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:44.631
<v Speaker 4>village that has a very extreme </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretation of the Koran and </v>

468
00:19:44.631 --> 00:19:44.880
<v Speaker 4>apparently the Koran does not allow </v>
<v Speaker 4>gambling,</v>

469
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:50.090
<v Speaker 4>does not allow any sort of games and </v>
<v Speaker 4>does not allow dancing and any of those </v>

470
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.000
<v Speaker 4>things they'll lock you up for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is considered basically no gain,</v>

471
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:57.260
<v Speaker 4>no happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they go and go door to door in </v>

472
00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.650
<v Speaker 4>arresting people for watching the World </v>
<v Speaker 4>Cup.</v>

473
00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:00.480
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

476
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.150

<v Speaker 4>This is really good.</v>

478
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it smooth?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a coffee called Kopi Luwak and </v>

479
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.310
<v Speaker 4>it comes from the butthole of a thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>called a palm civet.</v>

480
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.600
<v Speaker 4>This animal that eats coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beans and shits amount and they go </v>

481
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.550
<v Speaker 4>through the Gi tract,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the digestive track,</v>

482
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:24.790
<v Speaker 4>and they pull these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

483
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.840
<v Speaker 4>these little beans out of his shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cleaned them up and sell them and they </v>

484
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.450
<v Speaker 4>see they make coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam in the coffee super smooth because </v>

<v Speaker 4>like a civic notice of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this big?</v>

487
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.850
<v Speaker 4>Fucking not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a little bit yet.</v>

488
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.240
<v Speaker 4>This is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

489
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.870
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>

490
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:43.580
<v Speaker 4>It's totally true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Called Kopi Luwak.</v>

491
00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:45.730
<v Speaker 4>Luw Ak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a cat.</v>

492
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.140
<v Speaker 4>Cat's a civic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it looks like a cat.</v>

493
00:20:47.141 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's got a long tail.</v>

494
00:20:48.101 --> 00:20:50.770
<v Speaker 4>It's like this weird animal that eats </v>
<v Speaker 4>coffee beans.</v>

495
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.920
<v Speaker 4>So it eats the beans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shits amount and then somehow or </v>

496
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.191
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess there were thought the beans </v>

497
00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:01.081
<v Speaker 4>were worth too much money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let these animals eat and like fuck </v>

498
00:21:01.081 --> 00:21:01.081
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's not let them go to waste.</v>

499
00:21:01.081 --> 00:21:01.390
<v Speaker 4>Like somebody must be desperate when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they first tried it,</v>

500
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:06.780
<v Speaker 4>but now it's worth like a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I probably wouldn't have tried it and </v>

501
00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:06.780
<v Speaker 4>let's discuss them with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What had been this Coffee Cup.</v>

502
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:12.700
<v Speaker 4>But then it has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has it added a new flavor,</v>

503
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.320
<v Speaker 4>changes the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes it more mellow.</v>

504
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:15.790
<v Speaker 4>It makes it taste better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really does.</v>

505
00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:17.050
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that good.</v>

506
00:21:17.051 --> 00:21:20.040
<v Speaker 4>I like my favorite coffees from Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>rocket launchers to on the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean someone like Liberia,</v>

526
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:17.080
<v Speaker 4>like some of the videos about you ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>seen the vice guide series online?</v>

527
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:23.250
<v Speaker 4>These guys that go to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the craziest fucking places in </v>

528
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:23.250
<v Speaker 4>the world and you see someone the </v>
<v Speaker 4>nuttiest shit,</v>

529
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.810
<v Speaker 4>like they went to the Arctic circle with</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy who lives up there in a fucking</v>

530
00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:28.270
<v Speaker 4>cabin in the arctic circle and then Hans</v>
<v Speaker 4>Caribou all day.</v>

531
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:33.540
<v Speaker 4>That's all he does is he hunts and eats </v>
<v Speaker 4>and and eats sort of happens when you </v>

532
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.051
<v Speaker 4>tap out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's been there for 30 years </v>

533
00:22:37.051 --> 00:22:37.051
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

534
00:22:37.051 --> 00:22:37.630
<v Speaker 4>It's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

535
00:22:37.631 --> 00:22:42.631
<v Speaker 4>they went to North Korea and they also </v>
<v Speaker 4>went to Liberia in Liberia is fucking </v>

536
00:22:42.631 --> 00:22:44.860
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are the first of all,</v>

537
00:22:44.861 --> 00:22:47.160
<v Speaker 4>there's been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's been war in Liberia forever.</v>

538
00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:52.170
<v Speaker 4>Liberia was basically founded the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from what I understand is they had </v>

539
00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:55.441
<v Speaker 4>American slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They let go and they sent them back to </v>

540
00:22:55.441 --> 00:22:57.790
<v Speaker 4>Africa and they formed Liberia and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>UN was there until really recently,</v>

541
00:22:57.791 --> 00:22:59.380
<v Speaker 4>like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years ago or something like that.</v>

542
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.500
<v Speaker 4>And now they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the place is just chaos,</v>

543
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:05.740
<v Speaker 4>it's just war and cannibalism is running</v>
<v Speaker 4>rampant.</v>

544
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.480
<v Speaker 4>They're eating each other left and </v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

545
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.470
<v Speaker 4>They sell like human food on the corner </v>
<v Speaker 4>like human meat and people don't know it</v>

546
00:23:11.471 --> 00:23:14.590
<v Speaker 4>and they buy it and guys turn people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's this one guy,</v>

547
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:19.830
<v Speaker 4>his name was general but naked because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he would go to war and he would get </v>

548
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:22.630
<v Speaker 4>buttoned naked and he believed that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>could not be killed because he would eat</v>

549
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.110
<v Speaker 4>the blood and flesh of an innocent child</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the enemy.</v>

550
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.050
<v Speaker 4>So they would go to the enemy's camp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would steal a child,</v>

551
00:23:29.051 --> 00:23:30.340
<v Speaker 4>killed the child and eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat,</v>

552
00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:35.370
<v Speaker 4>eat a piece of his fucking heart because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they felt like they wouldn't be able to </v>

553
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:35.710
<v Speaker 4>die in combat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a god that's alive right now.</v>

554
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:36.640
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like a plan.</v>

555
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:43.770
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Realize how fucking crazy the world can </v>

556
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:43.770
<v Speaker 4>be until you watch what's going on in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Africa.</v>

557
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.010
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

558
00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:45.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

559
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.950
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

560
00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:50.870
<v Speaker 2>I take a lot of comfort in knowing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I can only die once.</v>

561
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.610
<v Speaker 2>How do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did I don't think like you,</v>

562
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:56.630
<v Speaker 2>you work out too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be worth.</v>

563
00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.130
<v Speaker 2>He is the job like a flank steak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

564
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.890
<v Speaker 2>just some tough piece of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to.</v>

565
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.820
<v Speaker 2>You want be more ideas will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>delicious.</v>

566
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:09.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like veal and he could sell </v>

567
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:11.990
<v Speaker 2>them for days.</v>

568
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.500
<v Speaker 4>If you think about the way Africa is </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now with a lot of countries like </v>

569
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.530
<v Speaker 4>Liberia and Somalia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really is like the apocalypse.</v>

570
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.900
<v Speaker 4>Like if that was going on right here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that was over here,</v>

571
00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:22.200
<v Speaker 4>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we were in,</v>

572
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:22.970
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

573
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:28.040
<v Speaker 4>in fucking North Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was gangs that were eating each </v>

574
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.290
<v Speaker 4>other and fucking shooting at each other</v>
<v Speaker 4>and walking down the street with hyenas.</v>

575
00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.070
<v Speaker 4>We would go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

576
00:24:31.071 --> 00:24:32.600
<v Speaker 4>the end is here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the end.</v>

577
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I love about that </v>

578
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:37.640
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the guys who win all these.</v>

579
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Who's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Bill bixby.</v>

580
00:24:38.041 --> 00:24:40.090
<v Speaker 2>What the hell's the name of that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy with the.</v>

581
00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.210
<v Speaker 2>He's been riding a bicycle out here </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

582
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.410
<v Speaker 2>Solar panels in Bill Bixby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Ed Begley Jr.</v>

583
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm bad with the names and show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

584
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:55.500
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's goIng to be at the apocalypse.</v>

585
00:24:55.501 --> 00:24:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Comes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be fucked.</v>

586
00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.960
<v Speaker 2>I have this theory that people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>gather all this shit for it.</v>

587
00:25:00.961 --> 00:25:05.160
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need a militia because if you don't,</v>

588
00:25:05.161 --> 00:25:08.190
<v Speaker 2>all you're doing is you're just turning </v>
<v Speaker 2>your house into a supply room.</v>

589
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:13.450
<v Speaker 2>A target for the toughest guys who'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>come down the block and then just take </v>

590
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:13.450
<v Speaker 2>it from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My car,</v>

591
00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:18.530
<v Speaker 2>my car has like walkie talkies in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got fucking like every single </v>

592
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:22.720
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like sleeping bags just in case I've </v>

593
00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.430
<v Speaker 2>had to escape this city real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's starting to get retarded.</v>

594
00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Like I haven't like batteries that could</v>
<v Speaker 2>recharge by this sign and stuff like </v>

595
00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.271
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you realize the level of heads up </v>

596
00:25:32.271 --> 00:25:34.611
<v Speaker 2>that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How on the inside you'd have to be that </v>

597
00:25:34.611 --> 00:25:36.090
<v Speaker 2>this entire city wouldn't be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>gridlock of people leaving?</v>

598
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

599
00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:37.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

600
00:25:37.591 --> 00:25:42.591
<v Speaker 4>this city would be the worst ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't even know how many people in </v>

601
00:25:42.591 --> 00:25:42.591
<v Speaker 4>la.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I won't fill out the census.</v>

602
00:25:42.591 --> 00:25:42.890
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

603
00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:45.060
<v Speaker 4>filling out the census so you fit the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck is the point.</v>

604
00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:50.480
<v Speaker 4>There's about $20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million mexicans that you don't have a </v>

605
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.921
<v Speaker 4>count on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they literally have no idea how </v>

606
00:25:53.921 --> 00:25:56.331
<v Speaker 4>many mexicans are here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking just a flat out guests and </v>

607
00:25:56.331 --> 00:25:56.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm not shitting on mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

608
00:25:56.791 --> 00:26:00.840
<v Speaker 4>I would do the goddamn same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My grandparents were immigrants.</v>

609
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.760
<v Speaker 4>I would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got no problem with immigration.</v>

610
00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:05.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't even believe in countries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the whole thing is ridiculous.</v>

611
00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if they came over here,</v>

612
00:26:07.021 --> 00:26:08.010
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would fuck things up,</v>

613
00:26:08.011 --> 00:26:09.060
<v Speaker 4>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really.</v>

614
00:26:09.061 --> 00:26:14.061
<v Speaker 4>That's how it's supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to keep people </v>

615
00:26:14.061 --> 00:26:14.061
<v Speaker 4>impoverished in a shitty place just </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know you,</v>

616
00:26:14.061 --> 00:26:18.901
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you claim this patch of dirt and don't </v>

617
00:26:18.901 --> 00:26:18.901
<v Speaker 4>let them over here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's ridiculous.</v>

618
00:26:18.901 --> 00:26:22.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there weren't countries and you were </v>

619
00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:22.570
<v Speaker 2>just allowed to just sort of cruise </v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

620
00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:22.570
<v Speaker 2>like where would you go?</v>

621
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:25.240
<v Speaker 4>That would be the problem was things </v>
<v Speaker 4>would.</v>

622
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:30.290
<v Speaker 4>they would level out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is you let people go and </v>

623
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:33.971
<v Speaker 4>move to wherever they want and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are always going to move to the place </v>

624
00:26:33.971 --> 00:26:34.190
<v Speaker 4>where it's better and they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>abandon their shitty place,</v>

625
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:39.370
<v Speaker 4>but if you don't allow them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to stay in a shitty place and </v>

626
00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:39.370
<v Speaker 4>make their shitty place better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they never going to fucking do.</v>

627
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.500
<v Speaker 4>So you ensure that there's always going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be levels of people.</v>

628
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.980
<v Speaker 4>The only way to keep levels other than </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is just fuCking be heavily armed.</v>

629
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:52.250
<v Speaker 4>You have to be armed to the teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your whole town would have to be an </v>

630
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:52.250
<v Speaker 4>armory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

631
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:52.740
<v Speaker 4>like literally if you wanted to keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>people out,</v>

632
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.740
<v Speaker 4>you would have to like constantly be </v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting people constantly.</v>

633
00:26:55.741 --> 00:26:56.190
<v Speaker 4>THe weapons</v>

634
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.200
<v Speaker 2>they have now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

635
00:26:57.201 --> 00:27:02.201
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just love how they've been stealing </v>

636
00:27:02.201 --> 00:27:04.821
<v Speaker 2>money from our paychecks to basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>invent these weapons that will make it </v>

637
00:27:04.821 --> 00:27:06.090
<v Speaker 2>impossible for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll never be another revolution.</v>

638
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than,</v>

639
00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:07.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the blackwater guy,</v>

641
00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:13.250
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck it's called when we're</v>

<v Speaker 4>murder?</v>

660
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:04.810
<v Speaker 4>He's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's being processed from.</v>

661
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

662
00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.000
<v Speaker 2>he's the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually has his own hit basically.</v>

663
00:28:08.001 --> 00:28:08.840
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what I've heard,</v>

664
00:28:08.841 --> 00:28:13.841
<v Speaker 2>has his own militia and actually hired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets hired out by the us government </v>

665
00:28:13.841 --> 00:28:17.270
<v Speaker 2>for them to go over there when they want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do some covert extra filthy shit.</v>

666
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.280
<v Speaker 2>This is the worst.</v>

667
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.760
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend who went over there who </v>
<v Speaker 4>worked for who he worked for blackwater.</v>

668
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.500
<v Speaker 4>He went over there twice to two seconds </v>
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>

669
00:28:24.501 --> 00:28:25.710
<v Speaker 4>You asked me who they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

670
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:28.550
<v Speaker 4>I know who blackwater is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who this guy is that stores</v>

671
00:28:28.551 --> 00:28:31.190
<v Speaker 4>all these weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the head guy.</v>

672
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.360
<v Speaker 4>Well I have a friend who he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a sniper in the marines and when </v>

673
00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.510
<v Speaker 4>he got out he went back over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went back,</v>

674
00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.880
<v Speaker 4>I think he went to both Afghanistan and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Iraq,</v>

675
00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:45.910
<v Speaker 4>but he definitely went to Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went twice for money because he was </v>

676
00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.840
<v Speaker 4>opening up a gym and mixed martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 4>gym and he needed some cash.</v>

677
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:53.470
<v Speaker 4>So It just went over there for a few </v>
<v Speaker 4>months and he made some ridiculous </v>

678
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:54.440
<v Speaker 4>amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like something like $10,000</v>

679
00:28:54.441 --> 00:28:55.910
<v Speaker 4>a month or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a lot of money.</v>

680
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.190
<v Speaker 4>So for him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they'd go over for a couple months,</v>

681
00:28:58.191 --> 00:28:59.540
<v Speaker 4>make 30 grand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

682
00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:03.570
<v Speaker 4>did he do like the stereotypical go up </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the bell tower he had.</v>

683
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:08.710
<v Speaker 4>He was in a bell tower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was times where he was in the </v>

684
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.710
<v Speaker 4>tower.</v>

685
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's erik prince is the owner of a </v>

686
00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:12.370
<v Speaker 2>blackwater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm guessing that's,</v>

687
00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:13.320
<v Speaker 2>that's the guy that's in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

688
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:18.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like fleeing and he's in </v>

689
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.110
<v Speaker 2>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to take him down because he got</v>

690
00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:24.111
<v Speaker 2>too powerful because he could basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy could write out any sort of </v>

691
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:29.070
<v Speaker 2>uprising,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We haven't had merce rent mercenaries in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this country in a long,</v>

722
00:30:36.731 --> 00:30:37.990
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long fucking time.</v>

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.290
<v Speaker 3>This whole like giant mercenary </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporation sort of a thing.</v>

724
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:43.750
<v Speaker 3>This is very recent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just chaney and bush.</v>

725
00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:46.000
<v Speaker 3>They didn't use birth scenarios during </v>
<v Speaker 3>clinton.</v>

726
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.180
<v Speaker 3>There was no mercenaries during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>jimmy carter days.</v>

727
00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:49.810
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

728
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:51.970
<v Speaker 3>this is some crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chaney and bush,</v>

729
00:30:51.971 --> 00:30:54.940
<v Speaker 3>the hall and oates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that they can hire these people</v>

730
00:30:54.941 --> 00:30:56.890
<v Speaker 3>to go do shit that you're not supposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

731
00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:00.040
<v Speaker 3>They can ship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not in the geneva convention.</v>

732
00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.510
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's totally who I know we have,</v>

733
00:31:02.511 --> 00:31:04.730
<v Speaker 3>but we haven't been doing this openly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

734
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:06.770
<v Speaker 3>company to do it.</v>

735
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.560
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's definitely for that,</v>

736
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:13.620
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's like when wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 3>finally just came out and said it's </v>

737
00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:13.620
<v Speaker 3>sports entertainment.</v>

<v Speaker 3>oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

739
00:31:13.841 --> 00:31:15.880

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

00:31:18.341 --> 00:31:21.040
<v Speaker 3>And they changed it to wwe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He it the name of black water.</v>

743
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.870

<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

744
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.300
<v Speaker 3>Something short.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something happier.</v>

745
00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:28.430
<v Speaker 3>Bunny rabbits incorporated clearwater </v>
<v Speaker 3>fresh,</v>

746
00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:33.130

<v Speaker 3>Babies r us.</v>

747
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arrowhead.</v>

748
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.060
<v Speaker 3>We love the children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they changed it to.</v>

749
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:38.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>

750
00:31:38.381 --> 00:31:39.780
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

751
00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.000
<v Speaker 3>There's two schools of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is the world is a fucked up place.</v>

752
00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:45.730
<v Speaker 3>Look at what's going on in africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look what's going on in the middle east.</v>

753
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Don't you want somebody over there </v>
<v Speaker 3>protecting you?</v>

754
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.030
<v Speaker 3>They're just trying to keep America </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

755
00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:51.430
<v Speaker 3>Keep our stAndard alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep our standard of living the same.</v>

756
00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.680
<v Speaker 3>I see that argument too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you know,</v>

757
00:31:53.681 --> 00:31:57.940
<v Speaker 3>you see the also the other argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in that whole that those</v>

758
00:31:57.941 --> 00:32:00.910
<v Speaker 3>guys have to live the way they live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I live the way I live.</v>

759
00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:03.700
<v Speaker 3>It's still those guys on top can have as</v>
<v Speaker 3>much as they have.</v>

760
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.940
<v Speaker 3>Well that's definitely much more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what was pissing me off the other</v>

761
00:32:06.941 --> 00:32:10.290
<v Speaker 3>day like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think they also do keep it is,</v>

762
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.980
<v Speaker 3>it's a twofold argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

763
00:32:11.981 --> 00:32:16.981
<v Speaker 3>it's like they keep conflict going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the more conflict that keep going </v>

764
00:32:16.981 --> 00:32:19.861
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more we're going to need government </v>

765
00:32:19.861 --> 00:32:21.001
<v Speaker 3>and we're more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to need protection when </v>

766
00:32:21.001 --> 00:32:22.981
<v Speaker 3>that's been proven that the create </v>
<v Speaker 3>conflict in other parts of the world in </v>

767
00:32:22.981 --> 00:32:25.090
<v Speaker 3>order to control different regions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll arm someone if their enemy is,</v>

768
00:32:25.091 --> 00:32:30.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other side and they'll fuck with </v>

769
00:32:30.091 --> 00:32:30.091
<v Speaker 3>things and they manipulated it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But all that bullshit where they go,</v>

770
00:32:30.091 --> 00:32:35.051
<v Speaker 3>where they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well they justify like sweatshop labor </v>

771
00:32:35.051 --> 00:32:36.910
<v Speaker 3>and moving factories out of the us and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

772
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.670
<v Speaker 3>they just went around the unions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they,</v>

773
00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 3>they just justified</v>

774
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.090
<v Speaker 2>it by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

775
00:32:41.091 --> 00:32:45.380
<v Speaker 2>and they always say in order to compete </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a global economy,</v>

776
00:32:45.381 --> 00:32:50.381
<v Speaker 2>it's like fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like in order for you to have to </v>

777
00:32:50.381 --> 00:32:50.381
<v Speaker 2>get another yacht,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

778
00:32:50.381 --> 00:32:51.460
<v Speaker 2>You can't legally pay a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

779
00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:54.950
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck they pay over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in America.</v>

780
00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do it.</v>

781
00:32:56.511 --> 00:33:01.511
<v Speaker 2>So they just went around all of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and then they stuck all of </v>

782
00:33:01.511 --> 00:33:04.380
<v Speaker 2>everybody's in cubicles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the to is day because we were just </v>

783
00:33:04.641 --> 00:33:07.010
<v Speaker 2>talking about the military before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about the military.</v>

784
00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:08.780
<v Speaker 2>Now we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about corporations,</v>

785
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about big business where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think corporations are at the annual </v>

786
00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:15.200
<v Speaker 2>every quarter they have to show a profit</v>
<v Speaker 2>there at the end of what,</v>

787
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:20.320
<v Speaker 2>of legal ways to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now they're just straight up </v>

788
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.740
<v Speaker 2>beginning to steal like my fucking bank.</v>

789
00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.800
<v Speaker 2>That's taking 28 bucks a month out of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>account for no reason.</v>

790
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.480
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even notice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

791
00:33:26.481 --> 00:33:27.890
<v Speaker 2>on the road one of those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>accounts.</v>

792
00:33:27.891 --> 00:33:30.410
<v Speaker 2>You just have a couple hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I finally said,</v>

793
00:33:30.411 --> 00:33:32.690
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you take a 28 bucks out of this?</v>

794
00:33:32.691 --> 00:33:34.370
<v Speaker 2>And they did it on the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the laptop.</v>

795
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't be doing that.</v>

796
00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:39.020
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I've had this for five years.</v>

797
00:33:39.021 --> 00:33:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they go on.</v>

798
00:33:39.801 --> 00:33:42.700
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately sir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our records only go back four months.</v>

799
00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:47.760
<v Speaker 2>He had that convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet if I was getting 28 bucks from </v>

800
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:47.760
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the other way,</v>

801
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.920
<v Speaker 2>I bet they would fucking go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties.</v>

802
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:53.980
<v Speaker 2>SaMe thing happened to me and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>three months and this is what they said </v>

803
00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:53.980
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

804
00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:54.860
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if I bring in all my records?</v>

805
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.300
<v Speaker 2>What if I bring in all my records?</v>

806
00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.040
<v Speaker 2>And then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was still,</v>

807
00:33:58.041 --> 00:33:59.870
<v Speaker 2>we're only going to reimburse you for </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

808
00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:01.400
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got that.</v>

809
00:34:01.401 --> 00:34:02.660
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>

810
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.260
<v Speaker 2>and then the guy at the bank was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the bank looks at it like that's on</v>

811
00:34:06.261 --> 00:34:07.250
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

812
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Because I didn't send you to pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention that they're stealing,</v>

813
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:12.020
<v Speaker 2>stealing from me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paying attention.</v>

814
00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:16.910
<v Speaker 2>What he was basically saying what he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically saying was lawyer up.</v>

815
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're up buddy.</v>

816
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much how it works is that's why </v>

817
00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:23.410
<v Speaker 2>you have 30 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know for credit card,</v>

818
00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:27.101
<v Speaker 2>you have 30 days to return shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have 30 days to make sure all these </v>

819
00:34:27.101 --> 00:34:29.681
<v Speaker 2>charges are correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you get past 30 days and then </v>

820
00:34:29.681 --> 00:34:29.681
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty much screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

821
00:34:29.681 --> 00:34:31.400
<v Speaker 2>they do other shit where if you say one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these guys,</v>

822
00:34:31.401 --> 00:34:33.950
<v Speaker 2>I pay off my balance every month and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think you're getting them,</v>

823
00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:39.160
<v Speaker 2>this is what they do is if a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you pay it three days before it's a.</v>

824
00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.770
<v Speaker 2>This guy was telling me it ends up being</v>
<v Speaker 2>late because they send it somewhere else</v>

825
00:34:42.771 --> 00:34:44.630
<v Speaker 2>to be processed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They deliberately,</v>

826
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:49.170
<v Speaker 2>they artificially delay it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by the time it does get to the right,</v>

827
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:55.690
<v Speaker 2>it's messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is another one of those other </v>

828
00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:57.341
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone told me that in a starbucks and </v>

829
00:34:57.341 --> 00:34:57.341
<v Speaker 2>then I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

830
00:34:57.341 --> 00:35:00.371
<v Speaker 2>I got three quarters away through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence and I realized I didn't have </v>

831
00:35:00.371 --> 00:35:00.371
<v Speaker 2>any official.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

832
00:35:00.371 --> 00:35:04.850
<v Speaker 2>I do know that there has to be something</v>
<v Speaker 2>our official because nowadays you can </v>

833
00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:08.591
<v Speaker 2>write a check and within hours that </v>
<v Speaker 2>check clears your bank and I'm like </v>

834
00:35:08.591 --> 00:35:10.200
<v Speaker 2>that's a check and it's going through in</v>
<v Speaker 2>two hours.</v>

835
00:35:10.201 --> 00:35:10.680
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

836
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:11.490
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

837
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.600
<v Speaker 2>technology has changed in the banking </v>
<v Speaker 2>system so this is new.</v>

838
00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:18.080
<v Speaker 2>But yet if you try to pay something off </v>
<v Speaker 2>or do something like that,</v>

839
00:35:18.081 --> 00:35:23.081
<v Speaker 2>it's like immediately or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it takes like three days on your </v>

840
00:35:23.081 --> 00:35:25.460
<v Speaker 2>transfer funds takes like three days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it makes no sense.</v>

841
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:30.520
<v Speaker 2>It can be bad artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however long they can hold onto your </v>

842
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.130
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make interest off your money too.</v>

843
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:36.340
<v Speaker 2>So I guess if you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they hold onto your money and extra </v>

844
00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 2>few days before they do something and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you add that up</v>

845
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.640
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

846
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:42.270
<v Speaker 1>the million people they have in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>bank and the 365 days a year,</v>

847
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:47.480
<v Speaker 1>that practice probably nets them a </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant amount of money if you look </v>

848
00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:47.770
<v Speaker 1>at 28 bucks from every shit</v>

849
00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:50.170
<v Speaker 2>may who doesn't check for a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

850
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.500
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't notice when it until it </v>
<v Speaker 2>went under a thousand bucks because I </v>

851
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:55.500
<v Speaker 2>knew I had a thousand something in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

852
00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.780
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the thing counts I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>back east.</v>

853
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I came out here and I was always </v>

854
00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:03.350
<v Speaker 2>meaning to close that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

855
00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:04.890
<v Speaker 2>I had like 1200 bucks is something in it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't.</v>

856
00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:09.900
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden I'm out here </v>
<v Speaker 2>for like a year and a half and all a </v>

857
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.071
<v Speaker 2>sudden I get my statement and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like down to like 900 something bucks </v>

858
00:36:12.071 --> 00:36:15.891
<v Speaker 2>and that is on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is on me because I didn't realize </v>

859
00:36:15.891 --> 00:36:15.900
<v Speaker 2>that your bank could fucking steal from </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

860
00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:16.800
<v Speaker 2>And then just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

861
00:36:16.801 --> 00:36:17.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go fuck yourself.</v>

862
00:36:17.851 --> 00:36:19.440
<v Speaker 2>That's your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell you what,</v>

863
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.690
<v Speaker 2>we'll give you like 80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 bucks back.</v>

864
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gave you.</v>

865
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:24.510
<v Speaker 1>They gave you like three months back.</v>

866
00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if they did the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>steady what?</v>

867
00:36:27.301 --> 00:36:32.301
<v Speaker 2>I walked out disgusted and then the nba </v>
<v Speaker 2>final started read their circus and I </v>

868
00:36:32.301 --> 00:36:33.120
<v Speaker 2>started watching that and I never </v>
<v Speaker 2>followed up.</v>

869
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.130
<v Speaker 2>There's actually something that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed you guys,</v>

870
00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.440
<v Speaker 2>especially the audience might want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>check this out.</v>

871
00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:42.450
<v Speaker 2>I used to be a credit card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a bank or a credit card could like </v>

872
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:46.730
<v Speaker 2>if you had an ax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven charges go through at the same </v>

873
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.281
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can take out all those seven </v>

874
00:36:49.281 --> 00:36:49.281
<v Speaker 2>charges and in charge you seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>overdraft fees.</v>

875
00:36:49.281 --> 00:36:50.580
<v Speaker 2>That's how they used to be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

876
00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.760
<v Speaker 2>But something just passed recently that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could tell your credit cards and </v>

877
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.880
<v Speaker 2>your bank that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's no money in your account,</v>

878
00:36:56.881 --> 00:37:01.881
<v Speaker 2>you are not allowed to pull money out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're tryIng to trick you into </v>

879
00:37:01.881 --> 00:37:02.700
<v Speaker 2>signing and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

880
00:37:02.701 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 2>let's keep it the old way.</v>

881
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.970
<v Speaker 2>So they'll call you up or they'll tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>you like,</v>

882
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:06.900

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

883
00:37:06.901 --> 00:37:08.730

<v Speaker 2>go through,</v>

884
00:37:08.731 --> 00:37:09.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

885
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:14.511
<v Speaker 2>Well you need to accept the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That letter was that new letter is so </v>

886
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:19.560
<v Speaker 2>don't blow it off till all your credit </v>
<v Speaker 2>card companies know that if there is no </v>

887
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:23.241
<v Speaker 2>money in the account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want it to go through and </v>

888
00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:23.241
<v Speaker 2>you'll save yourself all those over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll,</v>

889
00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:25.500
<v Speaker 2>you'll never have an overdraft again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forcing overdraft fees on people.</v>

890
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:28.350
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to go back to the old way</v>

891
00:37:28.351 --> 00:37:33.351
<v Speaker 2>where you'd have seven things go through</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a $3 charge and then you get </v>

892
00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:34.470
<v Speaker 2>charged $39 for an overdraft fee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

893
00:37:34.471 --> 00:37:37.750
<v Speaker 2>well why did it go through?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no money in my account,</v>

894
00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made a deposit to cover it.</v>

895
00:37:39.331 --> 00:37:42.420
<v Speaker 2>They let they input the deposit last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

896
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.320
<v Speaker 2>And then bam,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

899
00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:49.460
<v Speaker 2>it deposit takes 90 days to go through </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the charge only takes three </v>

900
00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:49.830
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's nothing we can do.</v>

903
00:37:53.461 --> 00:37:54.540
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you always get.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

906
00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:02.620
<v Speaker 2>I got on a plane ticket the other day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I show up and all of a sudden I </v>

907
00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.350
<v Speaker 2>don't have a seat reservation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had one on the way out.</v>

908
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Well it's oversold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I didn't do that.</v>

909
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:11.770
<v Speaker 2>And then the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the lady has like an attitude </v>

910
00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:11.870
<v Speaker 2>with me and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

911
00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:16.160
<v Speaker 2>I spent full $500 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They asked me where I wanted to sit.</v>

912
00:38:16.161 --> 00:38:19.550
<v Speaker 2>I picked out the fucking seat and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>told to have a reservation.</v>

913
00:38:19.551 --> 00:38:20.520
<v Speaker 2>And then you oversaw</v>

914
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:23.010
<v Speaker 1>with a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

915
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.360
<v Speaker 1>If somebody pays for a car and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

916
00:38:25.361 --> 00:38:27.220
<v Speaker 1>your car is waiting for you and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes down.</v>

917
00:38:27.221 --> 00:38:28.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

918
00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.160
<v Speaker 1>it was oversold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I oversold.</v>

919
00:38:30.161 --> 00:38:31.150
<v Speaker 1>It should be against the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

920
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:33.460
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to make sure I sold the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I sold it twice.</v>

921
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not even as bad because you </v>

922
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:38.670
<v Speaker 1>can get in your</v>

923
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:39.190
<v Speaker 2>car and fucking drive home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be imagine if they go to interrupt you.</v>

924
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I know we oversold whatever car you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

925
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:46.500
<v Speaker 2>So they had to come and take yours and </v>
<v Speaker 2>took it away and you're fucking sitting </v>

926
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:46.500
<v Speaker 2>in your house going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

927
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:46.500
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to go to the airport.</v>

928
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing we could do.</v>

929
00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:50.480
<v Speaker 1>How can they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

930
00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:55.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if they're losing money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can they sell more seats than there </v>

931
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.490
<v Speaker 1>are seats?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should be.</v>

932
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.870
<v Speaker 1>That should be.</v>

933
00:38:55.990 --> 00:39:00.990
<v Speaker 2>I think they fought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figured out a way to have like 10 </v>

934
00:39:01.271 --> 00:39:06.271
<v Speaker 2>years ago when used to go on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times was the seat next to </v>

935
00:39:06.271 --> 00:39:06.271
<v Speaker 2>empty?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the time.</v>

936
00:39:06.271 --> 00:39:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally you'd get the whole row and</v>
<v Speaker 2>curl up back in the good old days.</v>

937
00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:11.710
<v Speaker 2>The good old good old days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When does that happen now?</v>

938
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:14.270
<v Speaker 2>And it never happens now because they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>always say like,</v>

939
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.810
<v Speaker 2>the cancel flights together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

940
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:18.950
<v Speaker 2>Don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

941
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.280
<v Speaker 2>And they'll just give away tickets to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that were like,</v>

942
00:39:21.281 --> 00:39:22.860
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a free ticket if you,</v>

943
00:39:22.861 --> 00:39:24.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just wait til the next flight.</v>

944
00:39:24.521 --> 00:39:29.521
<v Speaker 2>So they're not actually overselling it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't get rid of those </v>

945
00:39:29.521 --> 00:39:29.521
<v Speaker 2>tickets for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what though?</v>

946
00:39:29.521 --> 00:39:32.370
<v Speaker 1>The way I look at it that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have fucking airlines or I wouldn't have</v>

947
00:39:32.371 --> 00:39:34.860
<v Speaker 1>a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally need airlines to get along.</v>

948
00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:35.110
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

949
00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:37.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not against airlines.</v>

950
00:39:37.111 --> 00:39:39.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not telling me I have whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I don't,</v>

951
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.690
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate that too.</v>

952
00:39:40.691 --> 00:39:43.980
<v Speaker 1>But whatever the fuck they have to do to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay in business for us.</v>

953
00:39:43.981 --> 00:39:48.981
<v Speaker 1>For comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if you had a fucking </v>

954
00:39:48.981 --> 00:39:48.981
<v Speaker 1>drive to all your gigs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if you have a drive?</v>

955
00:39:48.981 --> 00:39:51.000
<v Speaker 1>If you had a New York gig?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

956
00:39:51.001 --> 00:39:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I got a gig on friday in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's monday.</v>

957
00:39:53.461 --> 00:39:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm packing up my car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you fucking imagine?</v>

958
00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:57.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't be great.</v>

959
00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Would be immediately how regional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All our comedy boston jokes.</v>

960
00:40:04.571 --> 00:40:05.380
<v Speaker 2>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

961
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.250
<v Speaker 2>there was a chain like seven slash 11 </v>
<v Speaker 2>called christie's.</v>

962
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:11.440
<v Speaker 2>You remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget the first time I did a</v>

963
00:40:11.441 --> 00:40:12.880
<v Speaker 2>gig outside of boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to,</v>

964
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:17.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like New Hampshire and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had some stupid joke about winning the </v>

965
00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:21.841
<v Speaker 2>lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How nobody respects you that you move </v>

966
00:40:21.841 --> 00:40:21.841
<v Speaker 2>into a rich neighborhood and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm a brain surgeon.</v>

969
00:40:22.871 --> 00:40:23.530
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

970
00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.600
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to christie's,</v>

971
00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:24.990
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

972
00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:30.080
<v Speaker 2>meaning I got a lottery ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even a good fucking job to </v>

973
00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.701
<v Speaker 2>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I went up to New Hampshire and </v>

974
00:40:32.701 --> 00:40:32.701
<v Speaker 2>I told the joke and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to christie's.</v>

975
00:40:32.701 --> 00:40:35.060
<v Speaker 2>That was the first time I used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reference that nobody fucking got.</v>

976
00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:40.240
<v Speaker 2>And I remember that high five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were gone by then the high five gig </v>

977
00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.260

<v Speaker 2>skyscraper.</v>

978
00:40:41.261 --> 00:40:42.580
<v Speaker 2>And like manchester,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Hampshire.</v>

979
00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

980
00:40:45.021 --> 00:40:45.680
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

981
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:50.910

<v Speaker 1>I used to do a lot of local material </v>

982
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.350
<v Speaker 1>when I was living in boston because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would kill,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he jokes about girls and revere with </v>

<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

986
00:41:01.661 --> 00:41:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I was disarmed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like none of my references would work.</v>

<v Speaker 2>references.</v>

996
00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.750
<v Speaker 2>The only time that's happened lately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lately is up.</v>

997
00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:28.670
<v Speaker 2>If I go over to europe and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was saying to somebody the other day,</v>

998
00:41:28.671 --> 00:41:30.350
<v Speaker 2>one of the few things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only,</v>

999
00:41:30.351 --> 00:41:35.351
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have to change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fucking was a reference to a,</v>

1000
00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:37.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ric flair.</v>

1001
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Really ric flair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how big those guys are.</v>

1002
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1003
00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.610
<v Speaker 2>dublin and glasgow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scotland.</v>

1004
00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:48.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a lot of american,</v>

1005
00:41:48.331 --> 00:41:50.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>american culture over there.</v>

1006
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:55.420
<v Speaker 4>England especially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find it english american comedians </v>

1007
00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.510
<v Speaker 4>translate way quicker to england in </v>
<v Speaker 4>england due to american.</v>

1008
00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:58.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

1009
00:41:58.741 --> 00:41:59.640
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1010
00:41:59.641 --> 00:42:02.640
<v Speaker 2>we're stuck with snobs over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hear like a british accent.</v>

1011
00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.300
<v Speaker 4>English.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1012
00:42:04.301 --> 00:42:09.301
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying like the comedy doesn't </v>

1013
00:42:09.301 --> 00:42:10.300
<v Speaker 4>translate as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a very specific type of humor.</v>

1014
00:42:10.301 --> 00:42:12.070
<v Speaker 4>But they get ours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1015
00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I feel like I felt </v>

1016
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:18.050
<v Speaker 2>when british comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians,</v>

1017
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:21.660
<v Speaker 2>comedian over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I either love him or I not only do,</v>

1018
00:42:21.661 --> 00:42:26.661
<v Speaker 2>I not like them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like they're like 15 years </v>

1019
00:42:26.661 --> 00:42:26.661
<v Speaker 2>behind the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is</v>

1020
00:42:26.661 --> 00:42:30.850
<v Speaker 4>because nice over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like the attitude they have </v>

1021
00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:34.091
<v Speaker 4>as a country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a culture hampers their ability to </v>

1022
00:42:34.091 --> 00:42:34.790
<v Speaker 4>stand up because real standup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a part of real estate.</v>

1023
00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:36.380
<v Speaker 4>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

1024
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have that.</v>

1025
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.740
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't get.</v>

1026
00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.700
<v Speaker 4>But somehow it comes out in the music </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

1027
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:45.730
<v Speaker 4>Like it always seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know everything from like the sex </v>

1028
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:45.790
<v Speaker 4>pistols to fuckin ozzy osborne,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these elders,</v>

1029
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.310
<v Speaker 4>these baroque angry fucking dudes </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting too.</v>

1030
00:42:49.311 --> 00:42:51.980
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of tough mma guys would </v>
<v Speaker 4>come out of the uk somehow.</v>

1031
00:42:51.981 --> 00:42:53.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to think of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're more poLite.</v>

1032
00:42:53.841 --> 00:42:55.720
<v Speaker 4>There's something about their humor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

1033
00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:57.230
<v Speaker 4>you know what It is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cheeky.</v>

1034
00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:00.320
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that the word that she is cheeky?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1035
00:43:00.321 --> 00:43:03.200
<v Speaker 4>What it is is just some of them were </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good,</v>

1036
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:06.020
<v Speaker 4>but some of them are just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just doesn't,</v>

1037
00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think first of all,</v>

1038
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:10.760
<v Speaker 4>those style of comedy that you and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>come from too,</v>

1039
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:14.720
<v Speaker 4>you get very spoiled at a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular type of colleague.</v>

1040
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:17.990
<v Speaker 4>Boston comedy is a very specific kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy.</v>

1041
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.230
<v Speaker 4>If you stop and think about how many </v>
<v Speaker 4>good comics have come from boston,</v>

1042
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:23.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jay leno came from boston.</v>

1043
00:43:23.721 --> 00:43:28.721
<v Speaker 4>Steven wright came from boston guys that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't know that it probably </v>

1044
00:43:28.721 --> 00:43:29.960
<v Speaker 4>better than 90 percent of the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are like big name comics.</v>

1045
00:43:29.961 --> 00:43:33.200
<v Speaker 4>Like gavin don gavin's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the funniest guys ever walked the</v>

1046
00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:34.730
<v Speaker 4>face of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1047
00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:36.530
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a monster.</v>

1048
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:37.330
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>

1049
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.650
<v Speaker 2>I think it's all like the east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all the way down to like dc,</v>

1050
00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.200
<v Speaker 2>the amount of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I.</v>

1051
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:49.700
<v Speaker 4>But I also think because we're from </v>
<v Speaker 4>boston doesn't have to leave.</v>

1052
00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:52.230
<v Speaker 4>They didn't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those guys stayed there.</v>

1053
00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.780
<v Speaker 4>No one left boston.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The big monsters.</v>

1054
00:43:54.781 --> 00:43:57.950
<v Speaker 4>Steve sweeney,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kenny rogers sang those.</v>

1055
00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:01.020
<v Speaker 4>Don gavin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike Donovan when I was a kid.</v>

1056
00:44:01.021 --> 00:44:02.100
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I will,</v>

1057
00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:07.140
<v Speaker 4>when I first started doing open mics </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and those guys were all the </v>

1058
00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:07.830
<v Speaker 4>national headliners or the local </v>
<v Speaker 4>headlines rather they'd be at nick's and</v>

1059
00:44:07.831 --> 00:44:09.360
<v Speaker 4>they'd be it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The connection.</v>

1060
00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:14.930
<v Speaker 4>I remember sitting there watching those </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys and they would have like some like </v>

1061
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:18.711
<v Speaker 4>national guy would come through like </v>
<v Speaker 4>billy crystal and billy crystal would </v>

1062
00:44:18.711 --> 00:44:19.590
<v Speaker 4>come through and they would put on dawn </v>
<v Speaker 4>gavin,</v>

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:24.710
<v Speaker 4>steve sweeney and fucking and lenny </v>
<v Speaker 4>clarke in a row and then bring up billy </v>

1064
00:44:24.811 --> 00:44:27.630
<v Speaker 4>crystal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they did it on purpose.</v>

1065
00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:28.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1066
00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.510

<v Speaker 4>so high there.</v>

1067
00:44:30.511 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 4>And these guys were doing 20 minutes</v>

1068
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.260
<v Speaker 3>tight to say 20 minutes to do it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

1069
00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.140
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them were doing local </v>
<v Speaker 3>references.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did something.</v>

1088
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:24.300
<v Speaker 3>He had some sort of back and forth with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the boss and he made this reference,</v>

1089
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:29.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically tell him the boss to go fuck </v>

<v Speaker 3>shit on the clock if I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I fucking fell out because it was </v>

00:45:33.861 --> 00:45:35.940
<v Speaker 3>always that lazy fuck wouldn't help </v>
<v Speaker 3>unload the trucks.</v>

1093
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:40.941
<v Speaker 3>He had every god damn trick in the book </v>
<v Speaker 3>and how to somehow make that eight hour </v>

1094
00:45:40.941 --> 00:45:44.331
<v Speaker 3>day go by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of them was when he had grabbed </v>

1095
00:45:44.331 --> 00:45:46.701
<v Speaker 3>the herald and the globe to go take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and it would somehow take like </v>

<v Speaker 3>working for cash for a long time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>nyt now.</v>

1153
00:48:00.201 --> 00:48:01.840
<v Speaker 3>We'd go from here to there and are there</v>

1154
00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.300

1160
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:21.400

<v Speaker 3>like a keg of beer over one shoulder and</v>

1161
00:48:21.401 --> 00:48:26.401
<v Speaker 3>like an eight ball in their hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we'll just be going from club to </v>

1162
00:48:26.401 --> 00:48:29.341

<v Speaker 3>I can wear a zip up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the sport coat,</v>

1262
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:51.190
<v Speaker 3>it just doesn't move with the shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wore a sport coat the first time I </v>

1263
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:54.941
<v Speaker 3>went on stage because I thought that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>how you're supposed to dress out of </v>

1264
00:52:54.941 --> 00:52:57.480
<v Speaker 3>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coat with the sleeves rolled up like </v>

00:54:07.531 --> 00:54:09.570
<v Speaker 3>He was number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he gets kicked off.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1297
00:54:13.411 --> 00:54:16.290
<v Speaker 3>That's what no one wants to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conan o'brian on the tonight show wasn't</v>

1298
00:54:16.291 --> 00:54:21.291
<v Speaker 3>that good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's bullshit because linda is </v>

1299
00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:21.291
<v Speaker 3>doing the exact same ratings right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>as as.</v>

1300
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:22.600
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1301
00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:27.650
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we're going to go back to that </v>

1302
00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:29.031
<v Speaker 3>dropped substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It dropped substantially from where it </v>

1303
00:54:29.031 --> 00:54:29.550
<v Speaker 3>was before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From where it was when linda was hosting</v>

1304
00:54:29.551 --> 00:54:33.000
<v Speaker 3>it to conan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on,</v>

1305
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:38.030
<v Speaker 3>hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fuck conan by not letting them do </v>

1306
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.030
<v Speaker 3>any of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't do the masturbating.</v>

1307
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:40.350
<v Speaker 3>Bear couldn't do all these different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different sketches.</v>

1308
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:45.500
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't do triuMph.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The insult dog couldn't do any of that </v>

1309
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:45.500
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

1310
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:49.490
<v Speaker 3>Because it's 11:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>show they fucked if when jay leno got </v>

1311
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:53.091
<v Speaker 3>the tonight show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he had to follow Johnny Carson </v>

1312
00:54:53.091 --> 00:54:54.120
<v Speaker 3>bombing for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally right about that.</v>

1313
00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:59.190
<v Speaker 3>But that's like if a comedian bombs in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of you,</v>

1314
00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:04.370
<v Speaker 3>right for an half hour in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you got to jack the tonight show </v>

1315
00:55:05.311 --> 00:55:10.311
<v Speaker 3>because of the tonight show was always </v>
<v Speaker 3>the late night show where guys would go </v>

1316
00:55:10.311 --> 00:55:11.520
<v Speaker 3>on and all the guests would go on and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be like an important spot.</v>

1317
00:55:11.521 --> 00:55:14.550
<v Speaker 3>Will the 10:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>spot became just as important.</v>

1318
00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:17.190
<v Speaker 3>So he was like siphoning off guests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1319
00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:19.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't have a guy who's promoting,</v>

1320
00:55:19.081 --> 00:55:24.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mel gibson goes on jay leno show and </v>

1321
00:55:24.081 --> 00:55:24.081
<v Speaker 3>then goes on tonight show as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1322
00:55:24.081 --> 00:55:26.250
<v Speaker 3>you're only gonna have one of the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>is all about with atlanta.</v>

1323
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:31.990
<v Speaker 3>So the brilliance of it was jay bombing </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually fucked conan conan here.</v>

1324
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:37.680
<v Speaker 3>We had this show for like six months </v>
<v Speaker 3>before they were started going like,</v>

1325
00:55:37.681 --> 00:55:38.850
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get this guy out.</v>

1326
00:55:38.851 --> 00:55:40.750
<v Speaker 3>And he got it back now I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1327
00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:43.740
<v Speaker 3>I think taking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a brilliant away from it.</v>

1328
00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:46.200
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>

1329
00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:50.170
<v Speaker 3>The way jpl played it was absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant and I don't know,</v>

1330
00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:52.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying bond on purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way he played it,</v>

1331
00:55:52.291 --> 00:55:52.590
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1332
00:55:52.591 --> 00:55:53.040
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

1333
00:55:53.041 --> 00:55:54.930
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the twelfth hour,</v>

1334
00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.570
<v Speaker 3>yeah I'm going to leave but I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>retiring.</v>

1335
00:55:57.571 --> 00:56:00.770
<v Speaker 3>and then they freaked the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like he knows,</v>

1336
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:03.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how we look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I understand jay being like,</v>

1337
00:56:03.661 --> 00:56:04.710
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I the number one show,</v>

1338
00:56:04.711 --> 00:56:07.020
<v Speaker 3>what are you kicking me off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or he's totally right about that.</v>

1339
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:09.750
<v Speaker 3>But I also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't look at conan like he failed,</v>

1340
00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:14.010
<v Speaker 3>like calling got fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got fucked.</v>

1341
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:19.100
<v Speaker 3>I completely agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I'm saying is you've got to </v>

1342
00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:19.100
<v Speaker 3>realize that jay leno had the number one</v>
<v Speaker 3>spot.</v>

1343
00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:22.800
<v Speaker 3>He was number one in the late night wars</v>
<v Speaker 3>before they gave it to conan.</v>

1344
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 3>So why would he</v>

1345
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.860
<v Speaker 4>give a fuck if they gave the show to </v>
<v Speaker 4>call and offered it back to him?</v>

1346
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:29.030
<v Speaker 4>Why would he not take it him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1347
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1348
00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:35.010
<v Speaker 4>but everybody's making it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like jay is this asshole for taking </v>

1349
00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:35.010
<v Speaker 4>conan's job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1350
00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:36.340
<v Speaker 4>gone and took his job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Conan's not a,</v>

1351
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.260
<v Speaker 4>he's not a poor man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a rich man.</v>

1352
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.790
<v Speaker 4>Like we're really</v>

1353
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.610
<v Speaker 2>worry about the most fucked up about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1354
00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:44.460
<v Speaker 2>And keeps saying don't feel bad for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made it.</v>

1355
00:56:44.461 --> 00:56:47.550
<v Speaker 2>He made a great little a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said a great little thing on his last</v>

1356
00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:48.300
<v Speaker 2>episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1357
00:56:48.301 --> 00:56:49.890
<v Speaker 2>don't be cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1358
00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.430
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

1359
00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I hate people who were cynically said </v>
<v Speaker 2>this really positive thing,</v>

1360
00:56:52.921 --> 00:56:55.620
<v Speaker 2>don't feel bad for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Played fucking free bird with the band.</v>

1361
00:56:56.010 --> 00:57:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Went out like a man and that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's never bitched about it or any of </v>

1362
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:01.920
<v Speaker 2>that type of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Million dollars.</v>

1363
00:57:01.921 --> 00:57:03.600
<v Speaker 2>I think that was super smooth things </v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

1364
00:57:03.601 --> 00:57:04.770
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what kona does,</v>

1365
00:57:04.771 --> 00:57:07.630
<v Speaker 2>he's an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1366
00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he gave a lot of that money.</v>

1367
00:57:10.801 --> 00:57:13.110
<v Speaker 2>He gave a lot of that money out to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people he worked with.</v>

1368
00:57:13.111 --> 00:57:14.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want it to fucking move back.</v>

1369
00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:20.120
<v Speaker 2>He felt bad for those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that I find annoying </v>

1370
00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:23.481
<v Speaker 2>about jay leno is acting as though he </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't a shrewd businessman.</v>

1371
00:57:24.421 --> 00:57:25.040
<v Speaker 2>That whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1372
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:30.050
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm going to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's how he wants to portray </v>

1373
00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:30.480
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the industry,</v>

1533
01:03:43.821 --> 01:03:48.821
<v Speaker 4>the financial industry.</v>

1535
01:03:49.701 --> 01:03:51.920
<v Speaker 4>dove in even though none of it made </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>

1536
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:54.200
<v Speaker 4>There was people that were calling for </v>

<v Speaker 4>I think I was the fucking head of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fcc at one point in time or what does it</v>

<v Speaker 4>Was it nasdaq?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was the head of,</v>

1541
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:09.020
<v Speaker 4>I think he was the head of nasdaq and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the not fcc.</v>

1542
01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:14.060
<v Speaker 4>He's the head of nasdaq and this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy goes on to be the biggest ponzi </v>

1543
01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.550
<v Speaker 4>scheme mastermind in the history of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

1544
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's pretty incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A guy that like worked in the system,</v>

1545
01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.950
<v Speaker 4>he must've known that it's impossible to</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure it out.</v>

1546
01:04:21.951 --> 01:04:24.050
<v Speaker 4>like I always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never paid attention.</v>

1547
01:04:24.051 --> 01:04:29.051
<v Speaker 4>Like I look at the stock market,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see all those numbers going back and </v>

1548
01:04:29.051 --> 01:04:29.051
<v Speaker 4>forth and I'm wondering what the fuck is</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that?</v>

1549
01:04:29.051 --> 01:04:29.680
<v Speaker 4>What does that even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1550
01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:33.770
<v Speaker 4>somebody knows to crap table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like it's all bullshit,</v>

1551
01:04:33.771 --> 01:04:38.771
<v Speaker 4>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously there's this alan greenspan </v>

1552
01:04:38.771 --> 01:04:38.771
<v Speaker 4>guy seems very bright.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got everything under wraps.</v>

1553
01:04:38.771 --> 01:04:42.400
<v Speaker 4>Someone knows until this whole financial</v>
<v Speaker 4>collapse came along and this bernie made</v>

1554
01:04:42.401 --> 01:04:43.130
<v Speaker 4>off thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>came along.</v>

1555
01:04:43.131 --> 01:04:43.760
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1556
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:45.590
<v Speaker 4>they don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody even knows.</v>

1557
01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:46.910
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows how this thing works.</v>

1558
01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:47.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1559
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:53.230
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a belief system that's crazy that </v>

1560
01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:54.090
<v Speaker 2>you have to believe that it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started reading,</v>

1561
01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:59.370
<v Speaker 2>I started reading up on it and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>

1562
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I always do,</v>

1563
01:05:00.391 --> 01:05:05.391
<v Speaker 2>I read a little bit and then I start </v>
<v Speaker 2>pontificating and then two follow up </v>

1564
01:05:05.391 --> 01:05:06.210
<v Speaker 2>questions that in my whole argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>falls on the ground.</v>

1565
01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:08.760
<v Speaker 2>But after reading a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read that book,</v>

1566
01:05:08.761 --> 01:05:11.430
<v Speaker 2>the case against the fed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1567
01:05:11.431 --> 01:05:16.431
<v Speaker 2>I stopped talking to people about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's like if I really start </v>

1568
01:05:16.431 --> 01:05:18.340
<v Speaker 2>informing people and everybody knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole is gonna fucking collapsed.</v>

1569
01:05:18.341 --> 01:05:23.341
<v Speaker 2>So I just became part of the line that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>liked,</v>

1570
01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.500
<v Speaker 2>lIke people going to put your money in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bank.</v>

1571
01:05:26.501 --> 01:05:31.501
<v Speaker 2>it's safe that it's insured up to 200 </v>
<v Speaker 2>really and you're going to go with </v>

1572
01:05:31.501 --> 01:05:35.701
<v Speaker 2>insurance companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only people that's fucking more </v>

1573
01:05:35.701 --> 01:05:35.701
<v Speaker 2>corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1574
01:05:35.701 --> 01:05:35.701
<v Speaker 2>it's insured until it isn't.</v>

1575
01:05:35.701 --> 01:05:40.470
<v Speaker 1>The craziest thing is when you go to New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York in times square and you said that </v>

1576
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:43.171
<v Speaker 1>one building that has the national debt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how it's accumulating and it's just </v>

1577
01:05:43.171 --> 01:05:47.071
<v Speaker 1>spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just add an extra fucking zero to it </v>

1578
01:05:47.071 --> 01:05:47.071
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

1579
01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:47.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1580
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:49.410
<v Speaker 2>they coming around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a,</v>

1581
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:51.230
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hit a point,</v>

1582
01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:54.320
<v Speaker 2>the legal amount of debt we're allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have.</v>

1583
01:05:54.321 --> 01:05:59.321
<v Speaker 2>So we didn't know what the fuck to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had a quick meeting and then </v>

1584
01:05:59.321 --> 01:06:01.160
<v Speaker 2>they just doubled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just doubled.</v>

1585
01:06:02.110 --> 01:06:03.640
<v Speaker 2>So now it's not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1586
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:05.660
<v Speaker 2>it's only halfway there now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1587
01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:06.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1588
01:06:06.531 --> 01:06:09.140
<v Speaker 2>do what I gotta admit like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of terrifying things about</v>

1589
01:06:09.141 --> 01:06:14.141
<v Speaker 2>living out here in los angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living in a city that is in a bankrupt </v>

1590
01:06:14.141 --> 01:06:14.860
<v Speaker 2>state with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1591
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:17.150
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really have a water supply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Technically.</v>

1592
01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:22.420
<v Speaker 2>You live in a fucking desert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The property is like a really overrun </v>

1593
01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:24.530
<v Speaker 2>and all that crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A drug cartel shit.</v>

1594
01:06:24.531 --> 01:06:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Emmy is essentially a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapidly.</v>

1595
01:06:27.351 --> 01:06:29.330
<v Speaker 2>It's right down the fucking street</v>

1596
01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:34.890
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you live in in Afghanistan </v>

1597
01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:34.890
<v Speaker 1>and the war is two hours away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like,</v>

1598
01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:35.590
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're pretty close to the sheer.</v>

1599
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:36.190
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1600
01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.600
<v Speaker 2>They take a road trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to go to the war today?</v>

1601
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally.</v>

1602
01:06:40.131 --> 01:06:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're in san diego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever I'm down in san diego,</v>

1603
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:45.330
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking half an hour from 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>walnuts.</v>

1604
01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.330
<v Speaker 2>Unsettling and those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

1605
01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:47.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1606
01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:52.810
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that I wish there was a </v>

1607
01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:56.510
<v Speaker 2>mexican comedian here right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really just thought it was because of </v>

1608
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:59.270
<v Speaker 2>this call will be barcelona one I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>always wondered is why they got so </v>

1609
01:06:59.270 --> 01:07:01.360
<v Speaker 2>offended by that sign that has the </v>
<v Speaker 2>running.</v>

1610
01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans don't running family across the</v>
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

1611
01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.230
<v Speaker 2>Why is that offensive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to run over you.</v>

1612
01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:14.330
<v Speaker 1>people are embarrassed because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed by the idea that mexicans </v>

1613
01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:14.330
<v Speaker 1>have to get into this country that way</v>

1614
01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:15.550
<v Speaker 2>and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1615
01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:20.580
<v Speaker 2>It's embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not realistic because there's only </v>

1616
01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:21.430
<v Speaker 2>three people in the field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's embarrassing.</v>

1617
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea about Mexico being that </v>
<v Speaker 1>close,</v>

1618
01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:26.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be embarrassing.</v>

1619
01:07:26.241 --> 01:07:31.241
<v Speaker 1>There's no other place in the world that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know of where there's a first world </v>

1620
01:07:31.241 --> 01:07:31.241
<v Speaker 1>country connected to a third world </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

1621
01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:36.640
<v Speaker 1>You know what the fuck is this solution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See If you open the borders and you let </v>

1622
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.640
<v Speaker 1>people go everywhere that they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

1623
01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.140
<v Speaker 1>this is not gonna last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1624
01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:42.410
<v Speaker 1>this standard of living that we have in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

1625
01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.260
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be the same if we had open </v>
<v Speaker 1>borders and anybody could just immigrate</v>

1626
01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:47.270
<v Speaker 1>to America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would get fucked quick.</v>

1676
01:09:56.411 --> 01:10:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm really surprised at some of the shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I finally like.</v>

1677
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:05.290
<v Speaker 2>The only thing I ever worked on was </v>
<v Speaker 2>being a comedian because I thought it </v>

1678
01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:05.500
<v Speaker 2>was going to solve all my problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are going to see me on stage.</v>

1679
01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:08.390
<v Speaker 2>He's funny and every going to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking with me and everything was gonna</v>

1680
01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:13.410
<v Speaker 2>work out and then what ended up </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening is the only thing I was </v>

1681
01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:13.410
<v Speaker 2>remotely decent that was being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian.</v>

1682
01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:15.010
<v Speaker 2>So I finally learned how to start fixing</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1683
01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of shit did I fix my </v>
<v Speaker 2>toilet and one in New York.</v>

1684
01:10:18.701 --> 01:10:20.980
<v Speaker 2>I got a tenant back there and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitching about something.</v>

1685
01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:24.430
<v Speaker 2>We got this fucking awful landlord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He always comes in,</v>

1686
01:10:24.431 --> 01:10:26.800
<v Speaker 2>I swear to god with used parts from </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

1687
01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:32.160
<v Speaker 2>other apartments and they never worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just looked in the back like I was </v>

1688
01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.510
<v Speaker 2>just picturing how dumb he looks yet he </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows how to do it.</v>

1689
01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:35.740
<v Speaker 2>So I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I did.</v>

1690
01:10:35.741 --> 01:10:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I went on youtube and watched a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>of videos,</v>

1691
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:41.560
<v Speaker 2>a toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basic and I just sorta figured shit</v>

1692
01:10:41.561 --> 01:10:41.980
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1693
01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:44.290
<v Speaker 2>and I listened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I flushed it,</v>

1694
01:10:44.291 --> 01:10:46.990
<v Speaker 2>I looked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured out what the flapper.</v>

1695
01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking $8 flapper and then I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1696
01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1697
01:10:51.131 --> 01:10:52.440
<v Speaker 2>how does this go in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's just like,</v>

1698
01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:57.450
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like when I got better at </v>

1699
01:10:57.450 --> 01:10:58.210
<v Speaker 2>computers where I stopped freaking out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just was like,</v>

1700
01:10:58.211 --> 01:11:01.090
<v Speaker 2>just stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take in information,</v>

1701
01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:04.770
<v Speaker 2>process it and think that's what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking it.</v>

1702
01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.670
<v Speaker 3>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had the time,</v>

1703
01:11:06.671 --> 01:11:11.671
<v Speaker 3>the patients and the interest to build </v>
<v Speaker 3>my own car because I would love to get </v>

1704
01:11:11.671 --> 01:11:12.440
<v Speaker 3>one of those kits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Corvette,</v>

<v Speaker 3>The body's good on fucking toss at 3:50.</v>

1706
01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:20.130
<v Speaker 3>I wish they didn't do it with bondo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's off the mask.</v>

1707
01:11:20.131 --> 01:11:22.630
<v Speaker 3>On the old jeep kits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you remember the old jeep kits.</v>

1708
01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:24.390
<v Speaker 3>You could buy a kit and build your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>army.</v>

1709
01:11:24.391 --> 01:11:26.070
<v Speaker 3>Jeep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember it was like a thousand bucks or</v>

1710
01:11:26.071 --> 01:11:27.520
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They still have costs.</v>

1711
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:32.990
<v Speaker 3>And you can take a kit car like a noble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember they used to sell the noble </v>

1712
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:34.170
<v Speaker 3>in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you couldn't buy with a powertrain.</v>

1713
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:36.490
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't buy with an engineer to put</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own engine.</v>

1714
01:11:36.491 --> 01:11:41.491
<v Speaker 3>You're on powertrain in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's basically like a do it yourself </v>

1715
01:11:41.491 --> 01:11:41.491
<v Speaker 3>fucking car</v>

1716
01:11:41.491 --> 01:11:41.700
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1717
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:44.430
<v Speaker 2>who had a friend in this state I used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>live in.</v>

1718
01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to say where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1719
01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:51.530
<v Speaker 2>back in the day that jeep cj seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically kept the same chassis,</v>

1720
01:11:52.081 --> 01:11:55.410
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that shit for like fucking 15 years,</v>

1721
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:57.750
<v Speaker 2>so he had some old piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1722
01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:02.840
<v Speaker 2>so he did was he went out and he stole a</v>
<v Speaker 2>brand new one and just parked them side </v>

1723
01:12:03.631 --> 01:12:08.250
<v Speaker 2>by side in his garage and just took </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart the new one and put all the new so</v>

1724
01:12:08.251 --> 01:12:13.251
<v Speaker 2>all the numbers still match whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers are supposed to be like on the </v>

1725
01:12:13.251 --> 01:12:14.400
<v Speaker 2>frame and all that to everything matched</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he just,</v>

1726
01:12:14.401 --> 01:12:19.401
<v Speaker 2>he did like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like plastic surgery and he just took </v>

1727
01:12:19.401 --> 01:12:22.611
<v Speaker 2>all the new shit that he needed a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he had to keep his engine block </v>

1728
01:12:22.611 --> 01:12:26.870
<v Speaker 2>and there was the frame or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like gearheads would know what he would </v>

1729
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:27.210
<v Speaker 2>have to do with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the stuff.</v>

1730
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Then he just took like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had like a welt and he was like a </v>

1731
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.270
<v Speaker 2>welding thing and he just sort of cut it</v>
<v Speaker 2>into pieces</v>

1732
01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:36.530
<v Speaker 3>of remember the greatest scape when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would just drive the dirt on the bottom.</v>

1733
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just sort of dumped shit here or </v>

1734
01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:41.960
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just have a piece of a frame,</v>

1735
01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:42.600
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to give a fuck or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1736
01:12:42.601 --> 01:12:44.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you prove it?</v>

1737
01:12:44.730 --> 01:12:45.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1738
01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I didn't really.</v>

1739
01:12:46.411 --> 01:12:50.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't have the mechanical know </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to say exactly what he did,</v>

1740
01:12:50.221 --> 01:12:52.020
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I said what did he do with the extra</v>

1741
01:12:52.021 --> 01:12:57.021
<v Speaker 2>shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was basically yet he cut it down </v>

1742
01:12:57.021 --> 01:12:57.021
<v Speaker 2>into smaller pieces.</v>

1743
01:12:57.021 --> 01:13:00.100
<v Speaker 3>You can't fucking build a car today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't build a new 2011 shelby </v>

1744
01:13:00.471 --> 01:13:03.040
<v Speaker 3>mustang convertible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't build it now with no.</v>

1745
01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:06.590
<v Speaker 3>But when you can do and there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit going on.</v>

1746
01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:08.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so complicated.</v>

1747
01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like the old days,</v>

1748
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

1749
01:13:10.911 --> 01:13:13.490
<v Speaker 3>if you in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're fucking engine blew,</v>

1750
01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.320
<v Speaker 3>you could replace your engine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1751
01:13:15.321 --> 01:13:20.321
<v Speaker 3>all you need is like a crane and a buddy</v>
<v Speaker 3>knew what the fuck he was doing and you </v>

1752
01:13:20.321 --> 01:13:20.321
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1753
01:13:20.321 --> 01:13:23.040
<v Speaker 2>but it was also much more like my first </v>
<v Speaker 2>card I had,</v>

1754
01:13:23.041 --> 01:13:26.520
<v Speaker 2>I had a ford ranger and I actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned if I wanted to go,</v>

1755
01:13:26.521 --> 01:13:30.000
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't have the balls to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't have a friend who could</v>

1756
01:13:30.001 --> 01:13:32.040
<v Speaker 2>fix the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1757
01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:34.500
<v Speaker 2>So I had to keep it very light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like a hygienist,</v>

1758
01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:37.310
<v Speaker 2>but like working on fucking car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1759
01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:38.470
<v Speaker 2>you learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1760
01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:41.670
<v Speaker 2>changing the oil is the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then You learn how to change the belts,</v>

1761
01:13:42.150 --> 01:13:44.730
<v Speaker 2>then you start doing the spark plugs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the timing light.</v>

1762
01:13:44.731 --> 01:13:47.980
<v Speaker 2>And I got right to the point where I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to start fucking with the,</v>

1763
01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I dunno what trying to do like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pistons and shit and maybe I'll,</v>

1764
01:13:51.481 --> 01:13:56.481
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to get some more horsepower in </v>

1765
01:13:56.481 --> 01:13:56.481
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>

1766
01:13:56.481 --> 01:13:56.481
<v Speaker 2>phil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking ford ranger,</v>

1767
01:13:56.481 --> 01:13:57.070
<v Speaker 2>two wheel drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you at?</v>

1768
01:13:57.430 --> 01:14:02.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just be happy that it says that is </v>

1769
01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:05.911
<v Speaker 3>running a change once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I dumped it into the sewer and </v>

1770
01:14:05.911 --> 01:14:07.900
<v Speaker 3>dumped it into one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was legal.</v>

1771
01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.900
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even think I was 17 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

1772
01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1773
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.230
<v Speaker 1>and as I'm dumping in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy walks by,</v>

1774
01:14:14.231 --> 01:14:14.620
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1775
01:14:14.621 --> 01:14:16.750
<v Speaker 1>that's a good place for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

1776
01:14:16.751 --> 01:14:17.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good place.</v>

1777
01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:18.460
<v Speaker 1>And I thought about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1778
01:14:18.461 --> 01:14:21.190
<v Speaker 1>he's making fun of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god,</v>

1779
01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm a douche bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1780
01:14:22.301 --> 01:14:24.820
<v Speaker 1>why did I think it was okay to pour the </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil and it's fucking drink.</v>

1781
01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.660
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought that fucks with me </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

1782
01:14:27.690 --> 01:14:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Really still still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about it sometimes I think about</v>

1783
01:14:30.490 --> 01:14:32.320
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that I poured oil into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>drain,</v>

1784
01:14:32.321 --> 01:14:34.330
<v Speaker 1>like a retard and that this guy came by </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>

1785
01:14:34.331 --> 01:14:35.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good place with that.</v>

1786
01:14:35.290 --> 01:14:36.490
<v Speaker 1>And then I was so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1787
01:14:36.491 --> 01:14:37.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a good place for it.</v>

1788
01:14:37.361 --> 01:14:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1789
01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:42.640
<v Speaker 2>It fucks with you because you're into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment or because he made you </v>

1790
01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:42.640
<v Speaker 2>look stupid because I was a retard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because it made me look stupid.</v>

1791
01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:47.650
<v Speaker 2>I was stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He probably thinks the same thing like </v>

1792
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:47.650
<v Speaker 2>that asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't probably still.</v>

1793
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:48.050

<v Speaker 2>That'll fuck.</v>

1794
01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:53.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a long time ago you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>uninformed because you're uninformed.</v>

1795
01:14:55.041 --> 01:14:57.050
<v Speaker 2>He becomes an old facility and old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That gentleman,</v>

1798
01:15:02.421 --> 01:15:07.421
<v Speaker 2>he's probably passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many weird things like that </v>

1799
01:15:07.421 --> 01:15:08.660
<v Speaker 2>that you're not allowed to dispose of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that to monitor water.</v>

1800
01:15:08.661 --> 01:15:09.830
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets into the ocean,</v>

1801
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:11.970
<v Speaker 2>but the crazy thing is that the oil</v>

1802
01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.570
<v Speaker 1>put in is nothing compared to what's on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking road every day.</v>

1803
01:15:14.571 --> 01:15:15.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's leaking oil.</v>

1804
01:15:15.801 --> 01:15:17.300
<v Speaker 1>You're driving up and down the street at</v>
<v Speaker 1>range,</v>

1805
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:18.050
<v Speaker 1>goes in the gutter,</v>

1806
01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:19.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo shout,</v>

1807
01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:21.730
<v Speaker 2>justify it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>any way you have to justify it.</v>

1808
01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:24.520
<v Speaker 2>I told you I'm ashamed to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One time I was in,</v>

1809
01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:29.530
<v Speaker 2>I was fishing and dump it in the woods </v>
<v Speaker 2>really has taken because I didn't.</v>

1810
01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:32.450
<v Speaker 2>I didn't smell as bad as that river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>

1811
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:34.670
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that you weren't supposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

1812
01:15:34.671 --> 01:15:39.671
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I figured out they had this </v>

1813
01:15:39.671 --> 01:15:39.671
<v Speaker 2>place down the street near the fire </v>
<v Speaker 2>department.</v>

1814
01:15:39.671 --> 01:15:41.720
<v Speaker 2>They had this big giant thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1815
01:15:41.730 --> 01:15:46.730
<v Speaker 2>you just dumped your oil and right back </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the day when there wasn't a computer </v>

1816
01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:46.730
<v Speaker 2>chips and it was easy.</v>

1817
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:47.930
<v Speaker 1>I was in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1818
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I was in the charles river fishing once </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was right across the street from </v>

1819
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:56.331
<v Speaker 1>my house where I lived in boston and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw this bubbling in the water and I </v>

1820
01:15:56.331 --> 01:15:56.331
<v Speaker 1>couldn't figure out what the fuck it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

1821
01:15:56.331 --> 01:15:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I was looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1822
01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:58.650
<v Speaker 1>something's like bubbling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like water's coming up.</v>

1823
01:15:58.651 --> 01:16:03.651
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw a rubber and then I </v>

1824
01:16:03.651 --> 01:16:04.050
<v Speaker 1>realized that what I was looking at with</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1825
01:16:04.051 --> 01:16:09.051
<v Speaker 1>some of it was shed broken sewer pipe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was pouring directly into the </v>

1826
01:16:09.051 --> 01:16:13.401
<v Speaker 1>river.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's too many fucking people and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep.</v>

1902
01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:09.580
<v Speaker 2>The problem is is they make too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>money off of us like we're not like </v>

1903
01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:10.520

<v Speaker 2>when the robots take over,</v>

1908
01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:19.580
<v Speaker 4>it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am legend.</v>

01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:21.140
<v Speaker 4>Deer running through the streets of </v>

<v Speaker 2>because they'll keep manhattan,</v>

1912

<v Speaker 4>People are useless.</v>

1915
01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:34.850
<v Speaker 4>I went to Colorado and I was living </v>
<v Speaker 4>there for four months and when I came </v>

1916
01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:35.570
<v Speaker 4>back a deer had decided to make my </v>
<v Speaker 4>backyard home in la,</v>

1917
01:19:35.690 --> 01:19:40.690
<v Speaker 4>this right out here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and every day this deer would be </v>

1918
01:19:40.690 --> 01:19:40.690
<v Speaker 4>wandering through my yard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chewing grass,</v>

1919
01:19:40.690 --> 01:19:41.990
<v Speaker 4>and they just decided to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Since nobody was here,</v>

1920
01:19:41.991 --> 01:19:43.820
<v Speaker 4>there's no noise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just started moving in.</v>

1921
01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.090
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Soon as I moved back in,</v>

1922
01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:51.100
<v Speaker 4>she stopped coming around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she could literally jump that fence </v>

1923
01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:51.100
<v Speaker 4>six feet high and it's fucking a wrought</v>
<v Speaker 4>iron.</v>

1924
01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.130
<v Speaker 4>She'd jump right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1925
01:19:52.131 --> 01:19:53.510
<v Speaker 4>they got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be eight feet.</v>

1926
01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:55.820
<v Speaker 4>I got a buddy of mine has a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has a problem with that,</v>

1927
01:19:55.821 --> 01:19:58.910

<v Speaker 4>You're really not that naval.</v>

1928
01:19:58.911 --> 01:19:59.410
<v Speaker 4>He'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no dude,</v>

1929
01:19:59.411 --> 01:20:02.570
<v Speaker 4>I got a kitten and the name at the deer </v>

1931
01:20:03.501 --> 01:20:05.830

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:24.840
<v Speaker 2>firstly you have to know like how a lock</v>
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>

1966
01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.140
<v Speaker 2>like what it is in there and this person</v>

1969
01:21:33.621 --> 01:21:34.020
<v Speaker 2>then take like a hairpin.</v>

1972
01:21:39.021 --> 01:21:41.880

2020
01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:47.350
<v Speaker 3>the ones who are in the group.</v>

2021
01:23:47.410 --> 01:23:50.050
<v Speaker 3>most people don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that.</v>

2022
01:23:50.051 --> 01:23:55.051
<v Speaker 3>I would say that a lot of people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>jewish probably have a problem with </v>

2023
01:23:55.051 --> 01:23:55.051
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2024
01:23:55.051 --> 01:23:55.300
<v Speaker 3>People are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very sensitive to that.</v>

2028
01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:04.920
<v Speaker 3>to explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

2029
01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:05.020
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think he was making fun of </v>
<v Speaker 3>jewish people.</v>

2030
01:24:05.021 --> 01:24:10.021
<v Speaker 3>He was saying like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>horrible thing and it is a holocaust,</v>

2036
01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:24.220

<v Speaker 3>university.</v>

2038
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:31.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a tricky one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The holocaust,</v>

2039
01:24:31.330 --> 01:24:36.330
<v Speaker 3>like it's trademarked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a word to describe anything that's </v>

2040
01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:36.330
<v Speaker 3>atrocious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything that's horrible.</v>

2041
01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:37.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really what it is.</v>

2042
01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:38.620
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a word to describe.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Usually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never looked it up.</v>

2044
01:24:40.691 --> 01:24:45.691
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's look up the official term of </v>

2045
01:24:45.691 --> 01:24:45.691
<v Speaker 3>holocaust.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I look up a and then look up the law.</v>

2047
01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:49.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2048
01:24:49.630 --> 01:24:54.630
<v Speaker 3>it was clear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that he's making light of this </v>

2049
01:24:54.630 --> 01:24:55.600
<v Speaker 3>horrible situation that has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a play on words,</v>

2050
01:24:55.810 --> 01:25:00.810
<v Speaker 3>but then he did make light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he fucked up and said they should </v>

01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:00.810
<v Speaker 3>get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was his fucking 60 years ago.</v>

01:25:02.861 --> 01:25:05.950
<v Speaker 3>he'd get away with it because it sounded</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheeky.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They gave you a day to get fucking used </v>

2059

01:25:20.011 --> 01:25:20.050
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>then you did the gig and then they flew </v>
<v Speaker 3>you back.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's kind of how I was in sydney.</v>

2063
01:25:26.411 --> 01:25:28.030
<v Speaker 3>I was only in sydney for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>

2064
01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:31.600

<v Speaker 3>but they do glean back in the tail and </v>

2073
01:25:58.531 --> 01:25:58.531

<v Speaker 3>inside.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that fucking elbow.</v>

2077
01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:04.610
<v Speaker 3>You've got to claim the most important </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2078
01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:09.640
<v Speaker 3>Can you get that clinch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got no space between you and take </v>

2079
01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:09.640
<v Speaker 3>the kangaroo to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>

2080
01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:12.590
<v Speaker 3>They've got a great standup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I bounced right back to their feet,</v>

2081
01:26:12.591 --> 01:26:13.220
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't even try.</v>

2082
01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:15.650
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking fucking arms are too </v>
<v Speaker 3>small.</v>

2083
01:26:15.651 --> 01:26:18.260
<v Speaker 3>The grapple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go to the under hooks ups,</v>

2084
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:21.200
<v Speaker 3>but you've got to go randy coture star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We juSt press them up against a tree and</v>

2085
01:26:21.201 --> 01:26:22.190
<v Speaker 3>work them over with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

2086
01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.810
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just breaking balls.</v>

2087
01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:26.150
<v Speaker 3>Work on animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Racking balls.</v>

2088
01:26:26.210 --> 01:26:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you rack a dog's balls,</v>

2089
01:26:28.041 --> 01:26:30.860
<v Speaker 3>do they go at all or are we the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones?</v>

2090
01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:35.920
<v Speaker 3>I think it hurts them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think when an animal gets into </v>

2091
01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:36.260
<v Speaker 3>that state where they're attacking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to kill you,</v>

2092
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:38.120
<v Speaker 3>they don't think about painting the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>people do.</v>

2093
01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:38.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2094
01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:41.540
<v Speaker 3>I've seen dogs fight with each other and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2095
01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:46.541
<v Speaker 3>they're wagging their tail like happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile they're ripping each other's </v>

2096
01:26:46.541 --> 01:26:46.790
<v Speaker 3>faces apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially pitbulls pitbulls.</v>

2097
01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:49.070
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't seem to experience any pain.</v>

2098
01:26:49.071 --> 01:26:54.071
<v Speaker 3>When they fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they seem to just just do it and then </v>

2099
01:26:54.071 --> 01:26:54.071
<v Speaker 3>think about the pain later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they block it out somehow because I</v>

2100
01:26:54.071 --> 01:26:56.000
<v Speaker 3>would not count on kicking a dog and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>balls.</v>

2101
01:26:56.150 --> 01:27:01.150
<v Speaker 3>If a dog is attacking you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your best move is to choke it </v>

2102
01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:03.791
<v Speaker 3>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if there's videos of monkeys </v>

2103
01:27:03.791 --> 01:27:03.791
<v Speaker 3>getting racked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know monkeys.</v>

2104
01:27:03.791 --> 01:27:04.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it would suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know her.</v>

2105
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:09.390
<v Speaker 3>They know it sucks because when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>attack people and chimps attack people </v>

2106
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.560
<v Speaker 3>that go for your balls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the number one things.</v>

2107
01:27:09.561 --> 01:27:14.561
<v Speaker 3>So do they try to eat your genitalia </v>
<v Speaker 3>that a rip your balls off and then </v>

2108
01:27:14.561 --> 01:27:17.330
<v Speaker 3>usually twist your foot off to take your</v>
<v Speaker 3>fingers off the bite.</v>

2109
01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:22.330
<v Speaker 3>People's fingers off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go for your balls to try to blind </v>

2110
01:27:22.330 --> 01:27:24.641
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They try to take away everything that </v>

2111
01:27:24.641 --> 01:27:24.641
<v Speaker 3>makes you human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All your valuable assets,</v>

2112
01:27:24.641 --> 01:27:26.660
<v Speaker 3>your ability to control things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your ability to use your dick.</v>

2113
01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.270
<v Speaker 3>I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate monkeys.</v>

2114
01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:31.190
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just some a bottom.</v>

2115
01:27:31.191 --> 01:27:33.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't like chimps or scariest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind chimps.</v>

2116
01:27:33.561 --> 01:27:38.561
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind gorillas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those little fucking throwing shit </v>

2117
01:27:38.561 --> 01:27:38.660
<v Speaker 3>at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spider monkeys.</v>

2118
01:27:38.661 --> 01:27:43.661
<v Speaker 3>I jusT don't fucking lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's from Indiana jones because </v>

2119
01:27:43.661 --> 01:27:46.121
<v Speaker 3>that monkey was a dick and ever since </v>
<v Speaker 3>some aggregated small month dixon organ </v>

2120
01:27:46.121 --> 01:27:48.530
<v Speaker 3>grinder guy from back when I was a kid </v>
<v Speaker 3>down in faneuil hall,</v>

2121
01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:53.740
<v Speaker 3>they would always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Granted they've had to wear that stupid </v>

2122
01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:53.740
<v Speaker 3>bellboy outfit so they probably weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a good mood,</v>

2123
01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:55.250
<v Speaker 3>but they will always creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2124
01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:58.790
<v Speaker 3>I grew up with a monkey now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not my monkey monkey by my grandmother's</v>

2125
01:27:58.791 --> 01:27:59.120
<v Speaker 3>monkey.</v>

2126
01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:00.560
<v Speaker 3>You're criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had a monkey,</v>

2127
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:03.380
<v Speaker 3>a grandmother and a monkey named chichi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chichi lived in the attic.</v>

2128
01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:05.530
<v Speaker 3>And you couldn't ever have chichi around</v>
<v Speaker 3>people because she,</v>

2129
01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.070
<v Speaker 3>she would bite you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheat,</v>

2130
01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:12.100
<v Speaker 3>you would chew gum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would give her gum and he would </v>

2131
01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:12.950
<v Speaker 3>unwrap the gum it in his mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he only liked my grandmother,</v>

2132
01:28:12.951 --> 01:28:15.130
<v Speaker 3>didn't trust anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if anybody got near him,</v>

2133
01:28:15.131 --> 01:28:18.680
<v Speaker 3>cheat you would attack you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I was in Costa Rica,</v>

2134
01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.560
<v Speaker 3>I had a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking crazy.</v>

2135
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:26.770
<v Speaker 3>Monkey jumped on my back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the monkey that they had in </v>

2136

<v Speaker 3>jumped on my back,</v>

2138
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:32.570
<v Speaker 3>hooked it's tail around my neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so now it's hanging.</v>

2139
01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.070
<v Speaker 3>It's inverted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging upside down.</v>

2140
01:28:34.071 --> 01:28:39.071
<v Speaker 3>It went right in my pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took my hotel keys and then went up the </v>

2141
01:28:39.071 --> 01:28:39.071
<v Speaker 3>tree in like two seconds.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was like a half a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Half of a monkey.</v>

2169
01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird animal.</v>

2170
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:46.830
<v Speaker 3>Baboons eat babies too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2171
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:48.870
<v Speaker 3>So to chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chimps eat babies.</v>

2172
01:29:48.871 --> 01:29:53.871
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you leave babies around and chimps </v>

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.780
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen the video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chimp eating the monkey?</v>

2219
01:31:39.781 --> 01:31:42.420
<v Speaker 3>If it's too far and it just shines on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the back of your head.</v>

2220

01:32:27.131 --> 01:32:31.390
<v Speaker 2>you could tell he never got arrested for</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything in his life and he just,</v>

2243
01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:46.650
<v Speaker 2>So they basically get her to go in there</v>
<v Speaker 2>again to go under and they drilled in </v>

2264
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Is he in a white collar prison?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2265
01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.890
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably can get fresca spite.</v>

2266
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:43.950
<v Speaker 2>The fact that his felonies were so </v>
<v Speaker 2>egregious that because they're not </v>

2267
01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:49.020
<v Speaker 2>violent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't give a shit so and so and he </v>

2268
01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:53.130
<v Speaker 2>nonviolent offenses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put them with other nonviolent </v>

2269
01:33:53.130 --> 01:33:53.130
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it works,</v>

2270
01:33:53.130 --> 01:33:53.710
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just know if you're rich,</v>

2271
01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:56.950
<v Speaker 2>you don't go to real jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he actually fucked.</v>

2272
01:33:57.190 --> 01:34:02.190
<v Speaker 2>The problem was was not how much money </v>
<v Speaker 2>he took was I think who we took it from </v>

2273
01:34:02.190 --> 01:34:04.660
<v Speaker 2>and they had as much influence if not </v>
<v Speaker 2>more as he did.</v>

2274
01:34:04.661 --> 01:34:08.650
<v Speaker 2>So he actually got life in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That unusual.</v>

2275
01:34:08.651 --> 01:34:11.700
<v Speaker 2>I just pulled that on my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what fucking.</v>

2276
01:34:11.710 --> 01:34:13.600
<v Speaker 2>I think it's unusual that he got life in</v>
<v Speaker 2>prison.</v>

2277
01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:16.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he did was fucking $50,</v>

2278
01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:17.260
<v Speaker 2>million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2279
01:34:17.490 --> 01:34:22.490
<v Speaker 2>you got to put them In jail for life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way he's going to pay that </v>

2280
01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:22.490
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2281
01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:23.170
<v Speaker 2>what would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that thing in,</v>

2282
01:34:23.171 --> 01:34:24.970
<v Speaker 2>in uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in rolling stone that this month,</v>

2283
01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.550
<v Speaker 2>matt [inaudible] article that it was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>one about,</v>

2284
01:34:27.551 --> 01:34:32.551
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those kids that have the biggest </v>

2285
01:34:32.551 --> 01:34:34.600
<v Speaker 2>internet cyberspace crime ever?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2286
01:34:34.601 --> 01:34:35.650
<v Speaker 2>I haven't read that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2287
01:34:35.651 --> 01:34:40.651
<v Speaker 2>he got to read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit will make you super paranoid </v>

2288
01:34:40.651 --> 01:34:41.350
<v Speaker 2>about where you use your credit card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys would sit outside the mall.</v>

2289
01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:42.820
<v Speaker 2>This was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was their,</v>

2290
01:34:42.821 --> 01:34:43.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

2291
01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:45.040
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their hacky way.</v>

2292
01:34:45.041 --> 01:34:50.041
<v Speaker 2>They first did it would sit there in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>car with like a fucking eight foot to </v>

2293
01:34:50.041 --> 01:34:53.100
<v Speaker 2>antenna and they somehow tap in to </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that shit in the fucking air is</v>

2294
01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:58.490
<v Speaker 2>that computer shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The satellite thing went back to that.</v>

2295
01:34:58.730 --> 01:35:03.730
<v Speaker 2>And as you use the credit cards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they somehow they would break into the </v>

2296
01:35:03.730 --> 01:35:03.730
<v Speaker 2>system or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>

2297
01:35:03.730 --> 01:35:05.660
<v Speaker 2>I can't even explain it to fucking dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's even,</v>

2298
01:35:05.661 --> 01:35:07.250
<v Speaker 2>even for a guy like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was fascinating.</v>

2299
01:35:07.290 --> 01:35:09.920
<v Speaker 1>So there was some sort of a wireless </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmission of your car,</v>

2300
01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:10.660
<v Speaker 1>your credit card,</v>

2301
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:12.360
<v Speaker 2>you in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2302
01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:13.930
<v Speaker 2>Buying a thermal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2303
01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:19.090
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you swipe your card and as they're </v>

2304
01:35:19.090 --> 01:35:22.561
<v Speaker 2>putting it into the system or as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>swipe it somehow that tapped into this </v>

2305
01:35:22.561 --> 01:35:24.010
<v Speaker 2>shit through the fucking air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's literally like magic,</v>

2306
01:35:24.250 --> 01:35:29.250
<v Speaker 2>like all those years of people pulling </v>
<v Speaker 2>out rabbits out of hats and it was all </v>

2307
01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:29.250
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys,</v>

2308
01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:30.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the fuck they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

2309
01:35:30.130 --> 01:35:31.780
<v Speaker 2>So they would do that and then they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2310
01:35:31.781 --> 01:35:32.670
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is bullshit.</v>

2311
01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:34.120
<v Speaker 2>It's too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too risky.</v>

2312
01:35:34.690 --> 01:35:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they somehow then they took it to the </v>

2313
01:35:39.690 --> 01:35:41.710
<v Speaker 2>next level and they got into the main </v>
<v Speaker 2>database database.</v>

2314
01:35:41.711 --> 01:35:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I needed a word.</v>

2315
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:47.910
<v Speaker 2>I'll go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The main database of all the macy's or </v>

2316
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.910
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people's critical.</v>

2317
01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:48.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2318
01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:50.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got like,</v>

2319
01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.100
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2320
01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:52.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what number am I?</v>

2321
01:35:52.130 --> 01:35:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Seven say 50 million credit cards.</v>

2322
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Banks are totally corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that the banks would hack into</v>

2323
01:35:57.331 --> 01:36:02.331
<v Speaker 1>people's shit on purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hired people to hack into people's </v>

2324
01:36:02.331 --> 01:36:02.331
<v Speaker 1>shit?</v>

2325
01:36:02.331 --> 01:36:02.331
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I think about.</v>

2326
01:36:02.331 --> 01:36:03.440
<v Speaker 2>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I,</v>

2327
01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:06.340
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I don't like is it's not my</v>

2328
01:36:06.341 --> 01:36:11.341
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's their money and they give it to me </v>

2329
01:36:11.341 --> 01:36:14.341
<v Speaker 2>in my job is to get in debt with it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't then they just fucking take </v>

2330
01:36:14.341 --> 01:36:15.460
<v Speaker 2>it for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's basically what happens.</v>

2331
01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean the hackers,</v>

2332
01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean tanked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that,</v>

2333
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:23.120
<v Speaker 1>you know how like the cia's always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>accused of selling drugs and the,</v>

2334
01:36:23.121 --> 01:36:28.121
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument for it is the bad guys are </v>

2335
01:36:28.121 --> 01:36:28.121
<v Speaker 1>going to sell drugs no matter what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

2336
01:36:28.121 --> 01:36:31.070
<v Speaker 1>The cia takes that money and use it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>covert operation to protect americans,</v>

2337
01:36:31.071 --> 01:36:31.310
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2338
01:36:31.311 --> 01:36:31.550
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2339
01:36:31.551 --> 01:36:36.551
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cia's always sold drugs and that's </v>

2340
01:36:36.551 --> 01:36:38.801
<v Speaker 1>just the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the bankers would get </v>

2341
01:36:38.801 --> 01:36:38.801
<v Speaker 1>involved in hacker activity just because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they figured,</v>

2342
01:36:38.801 --> 01:36:39.320
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to do this,</v>

2343
01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.340
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do this</v>

2344
01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:42.160
<v Speaker 2>at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be in another.</v>

2345
01:36:42.190 --> 01:36:44.080
<v Speaker 2>They just look at everything as revenue </v>
<v Speaker 2>streams.</v>

2346
01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that they look at shit,</v>

2347
01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:47.940
<v Speaker 2>well not we worked because they will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>self,</v>

2348
01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:50.750
<v Speaker 2>they will be sabotaging themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2349
01:36:50.751 --> 01:36:51.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my questions like,</v>

2350
01:36:51.851 --> 01:36:53.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always looking at these,</v>

2351
01:36:53.050 --> 01:36:58.050
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't think bankers are above </v>

2352
01:36:58.050 --> 01:36:58.050
<v Speaker 2>stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2353
01:36:58.050 --> 01:36:58.050
<v Speaker 2>of course</v>

2354
01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:00.120
<v Speaker 1>these hacker situations and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2355
01:37:00.250 --> 01:37:03.310
<v Speaker 1>you hear about this fucking russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>teenager made $50,000,000</v>

2356
01:37:03.311 --> 01:37:04.170
<v Speaker 1>in a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2357
01:37:04.171 --> 01:37:06.600
<v Speaker 1>in his basement and then he started an </v>
<v Speaker 1>empire,</v>

2358
01:37:06.601 --> 01:37:07.080
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>

2359
01:37:07.081 --> 01:37:08.370
<v Speaker 1>And he was just a hacker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2360
01:37:08.371 --> 01:37:13.371
<v Speaker 1>if I'm reading about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be some people that are </v>

2361
01:37:13.371 --> 01:37:15.711
<v Speaker 1>rich and powerful and recognize that $50</v>
<v Speaker 1>million some real money and if this </v>

2362
01:37:15.711 --> 01:37:17.550
<v Speaker 1>goofball kid in his basement is making </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of money,</v>

2363
01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:20.210
<v Speaker 1>is there a way they can do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I mean,</v>

2364
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:25.510
<v Speaker 2>is there any of this shit they have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hack into their own system.</v>

2365
01:37:25.581 --> 01:37:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I Think that they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2366
01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:30.980
<v Speaker 2>they steal from the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2367
01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:33.140
<v Speaker 2>the people who put money on us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the customers,</v>

2368
01:37:33.141 --> 01:37:36.140
<v Speaker 2>they still through like fees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2369
01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:37.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they definitely do that too.</v>

2370
01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:39.860
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get the gun a risk what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have for doing hacker shit.</v>

2371
01:37:39.861 --> 01:37:41.360
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if this guy is super rich,</v>

2372
01:37:41.361 --> 01:37:42.700
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to risk everything as</v>

2373
01:37:43.210 --> 01:37:44.550
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been a button.</v>

2374
01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Some other countries are pulling some </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit off.</v>

2375
01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.120
<v Speaker 2>There's something about that shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

2376
01:37:48.121 --> 01:37:53.121
<v Speaker 2>where I find that that type of shit is </v>
<v Speaker 2>so fascinating where you know,</v>

2377
01:37:53.250 --> 01:37:58.250
<v Speaker 2>you learn how to pick a lock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bullshit that I'm doing is no big </v>

2378
01:37:58.250 --> 01:37:58.250
<v Speaker 2>deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those guys who can actually,</v>

2379
01:37:58.250 --> 01:37:59.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hack their way.</v>

2380
01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:04.820
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what's even more </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting is that you'd be going to </v>

2381
01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:07.341
<v Speaker 2>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's ways to show you how to get </v>

2382
01:38:07.341 --> 01:38:09.711
<v Speaker 2>those like things that you put on atm at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gas pump and there's videos showing </v>

2383
01:38:09.711 --> 01:38:11.310
<v Speaker 2>how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how and where to buy them,</v>

2384
01:38:11.311 --> 01:38:16.311
<v Speaker 2>where it's like this thing that fits </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the credit card slot at your gas </v>

2385
01:38:16.311 --> 01:38:17.220
<v Speaker 2>pump and there's like a little camera </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you tape into the corner.</v>

2386
01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:22.310
<v Speaker 2>So wheN you're using outside right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why you never use your fucking </v>

2387
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:23.730
<v Speaker 2>atm because that's your money.</v>

2393
01:38:35.150 --> 01:38:40.150
<v Speaker 2>I used to be on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they would constantly be shutting </v>

2394
01:38:40.150 --> 01:38:40.800
<v Speaker 2>my credit card off and not realizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was a comedian.</v>

2453
01:40:54.090 --> 01:40:55.840
<v Speaker 1>hot and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was just,</v>

2454
01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say her name,</v>

<v Speaker 1>ago and she wasn't the type of girl to </v>

2457
01:41:04.331 --> 01:41:05.520
<v Speaker 1>work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was just type of girl that,</v>

01:41:05.521 --> 01:41:06.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was young,</v>

2459
01:41:06.541 --> 01:41:09.420
<v Speaker 1>she was 19 when I was 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just getting by on her looks,</v>

2460
01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:14.550

<v Speaker 1>exercise and it was so sad.</v>

2461
01:41:15.450 --> 01:41:18.030

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:39.330
<v Speaker 1>All I did was train and fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I did.</v>

2469
01:41:39.331 --> 01:41:42.090
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any social life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a girlfriend here and there.</v>

2470

<v Speaker 1>break up with me and whatever,</v>

2471
01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:47.880
<v Speaker 1>but all I did was train and fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't party.</v>

01:43:10.861 --> 01:43:15.861
<v Speaker 1>You can't stay in boston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so intoxicating because you can </v>

2512
01:43:15.861 --> 01:43:18.801
<v Speaker 1>make a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be in boston in the unit if </v>

2513
01:43:18.801 --> 01:43:18.801
<v Speaker 1>you were a nobody,</v>

2517
01:43:25.971 --> 01:43:25.971
<v Speaker 1>travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had $500 cash a week,</v>

2518
01:43:25.971 --> 01:43:25.980
<v Speaker 1>you could pay for your bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could eat.</v>

2519
01:43:26.190 --> 01:43:27.720
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to try to go on the </v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2557
01:44:45.970 --> 01:44:50.970

<v Speaker 2>Might've reopened it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2564
01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:02.520

<v Speaker 3>Because when I saw him,</v>

2754

<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2927
01:59:13.271 --> 01:59:13.990
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

2928
01:59:14.410 --> 01:59:15.790
<v Speaker 1>So I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just,</v>

2929
01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:17.800
<v Speaker 1>when you can't take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just tap out.</v>

2930
01:59:17.890 --> 01:59:19.810
<v Speaker 1>And I locked the choke on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squeeze on,</v>

2931
01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:24.840
<v Speaker 1>and he goes to tap and he's already </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and I let them go thinking </v>

2932
01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:27.430
<v Speaker 1>that he tapped and he falls and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>face plants on the carpet boxes.</v>

2933
01:59:27.490 --> 01:59:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Head of the carpet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was only,</v>

2934
01:59:28.610 --> 01:59:32.110
<v Speaker 1>he only fell a couple of inches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was unconscious immediately.</v>

2935
01:59:32.111 --> 01:59:33.700
<v Speaker 1>If you just let someone squeeze your </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck,</v>

2936
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.020
<v Speaker 1>he'd go out pretty quick.</v>

2937
01:59:35.090 --> 01:59:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that became the thing to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>for like,</v>

2938
01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:40.760
<v Speaker 2>like maybe like a week and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was in seventh grade,</v>

2939
01:59:40.850 --> 01:59:45.850
<v Speaker 2>we didn't understand what we were doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with somebody came up with it choking </v>

2940
01:59:45.850 --> 01:59:48.960
<v Speaker 2>now we you do is you would just </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically grabbed two handfuls of </v>

2941
01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:50.990
<v Speaker 2>somebody's neck on each side grabbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that juggler.</v>

2942
01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:53.230
<v Speaker 2>But the thIng about it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like this.</v>

2943
01:59:53.250 --> 01:59:55.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We Didn't know what we were doing.</v>

2944
01:59:55.220 --> 01:59:57.890
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some people were just grabbing like,</v>

2945
01:59:57.930 --> 01:59:59.990
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neck muscle they will,</v>

2946
02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:03.350
<v Speaker 2>they will back here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But occasionally people would grab them.</v>

2947
02:00:03.351 --> 02:00:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>False shit.</v>

2948
02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The file.</v>

2949
02:00:07.710 --> 02:00:12.710
<v Speaker 2>What happened with someone did it </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly and the dude did the same </v>

2950
02:00:12.710 --> 02:00:13.970
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fell straight forward and uh,</v>

2951
02:00:14.030 --> 02:00:19.030
<v Speaker 2>and then there was announcements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>announcements at the end of the day and </v>

2952
02:00:19.030 --> 02:00:22.480
<v Speaker 2>there's been a fad around the school to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be grabbing your classmates next.</v>

2953
02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:26.060
<v Speaker 2>His whole fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very dangerous.</v>

<v Speaker 2>lobe and all this fucking bullshit.</v>

2955
02:00:29.421 --> 02:00:31.600
<v Speaker 2>And it just basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you please stop choking?</v>

2956
02:00:31.730 --> 02:00:35.090

<v Speaker 2>It's fucking with you ever since.</v>

2970
02:01:02.060 --> 02:01:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Figure four leg lock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2971
02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:08.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't fuck with me until football a </v>

2972
02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:08.440
<v Speaker 2>few years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unorganized,</v>

2973
02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:08.440
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I never had the grades.</v>

2974
02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:10.260
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2975
02:01:10.380 --> 02:01:13.520
<v Speaker 2>that's when it really got bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the first first back pain ever had.</v>

2976
02:01:14.970 --> 02:01:19.970
<v Speaker 1>What do you thinking about those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that say that back pain is all </v>

2977
02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:19.970
<v Speaker 1>psychological?</v>

2978
02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:19.970
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bull shit.</v>

2979
02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people that actually say that</v>

2980
02:01:20.970 --> 02:01:23.960
<v Speaker 1>john sarno guy on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's fucking,</v>

2981
02:01:24.290 --> 02:01:26.690
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological back pain.</v>

2982
02:01:26.970 --> 02:01:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The injuries it exists but doesn't mean </v>

2983
02:01:31.970 --> 02:01:32.470
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all this</v>

2984
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:33.460
<v Speaker 1>guy like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2985
02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:36.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he says all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he attributes a lot of them.</v>

2986
02:01:36.371 --> 02:01:38.260
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they have injuries,</v>

2987
02:01:38.261 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>the injuries don't really hurt nearly as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much as I think they</v>

2988
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:41.510
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all psychosomatic.</v>

2989
02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:44.570
<v Speaker 4>I agree that he's basically saying we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of pussies pussies.</v>

2990
02:01:44.571 --> 02:01:45.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bunch of pussies.</v>

2991
02:01:45.591 --> 02:01:49.460
<v Speaker 4>And the idea is that the injuries a </v>
<v Speaker 4>distract you from other stress,</v>

2992
02:01:49.670 --> 02:01:50.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and take it.</v>

2993
02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:55.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a firm believer of just stretching </v>

2994
02:01:55.740 --> 02:01:56.030
<v Speaker 2>yoga and that type of shit because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2995
02:01:56.050 --> 02:01:57.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happens when you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>older,</v>

2996
02:01:57.791 --> 02:02:00.810
<v Speaker 2>but even just sleeping the amount more </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your,</v>

2997
02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:03.250
<v Speaker 2>your attendance or whatever shrivel up </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2998
02:02:03.251 --> 02:02:06.100
<v Speaker 2>If you have a sodomy hobbled to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathroom in the morning,</v>

2999
02:02:06.101 --> 02:02:11.101
<v Speaker 2>you would think that I played like five </v>
<v Speaker 2>years of professional ball or I don't </v>

3000
02:02:11.101 --> 02:02:14.191
<v Speaker 2>know what's going on with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I put if I stretched before I go to </v>

3001
02:02:14.191 --> 02:02:16.120
<v Speaker 2>bed or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm way better really.</v>

3002
02:02:16.630 --> 02:02:19.150
<v Speaker 2>My forte,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my foot is fucking jacked.</v>

3003
02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:22.960
<v Speaker 2>It's an old injury I had from playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>drums and uh,</v>

3004
02:02:23.090 --> 02:02:25.770
<v Speaker 4>it's a real hard to drum injury.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3005
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:27.230
<v Speaker 4>you'd be surprised.</v>

3006
02:02:27.790 --> 02:02:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Some other drummers went up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>planters,</v>

3007
02:02:29.501 --> 02:02:31.030
<v Speaker 2>fish a lot on what the fuck they call </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3008
02:02:31.031 --> 02:02:34.870
<v Speaker 2>but it was from I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had poor technique and I was trying to</v>

3009
02:02:34.930 --> 02:02:39.930
<v Speaker 2>do this bass drum lick a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing that john bonham did and the </v>

<v Speaker 2>song good times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad times.</v>

3011
02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:42.190
<v Speaker 2>These really quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 16th note,</v>

3012
02:02:42.191 --> 02:02:43.180
<v Speaker 2>triplets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>triplets.</v>

3013

<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fight game.</v>

3014
02:02:44.650 --> 02:02:45.730
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying,</v>

3015
02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:47.710
<v Speaker 2>I had bad technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I was doing and I,</v>

3016
02:02:47.711 --> 02:02:52.711
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up the arch of it and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally felt like as I was walking </v>

3017
02:02:52.711 --> 02:02:52.711
<v Speaker 2>down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone was like,</v>

3018
02:02:52.711 --> 02:02:54.730
<v Speaker 2>I was stepping on nails and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what to do.</v>

3019
02:02:54.970 --> 02:02:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Typical irish guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought,</v>

3020
02:02:56.711 --> 02:02:59.500
<v Speaker 2>well just fucking stick it in the air </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a minute and it'll be fine.</v>

3021
02:02:59.501 --> 02:03:01.850
<v Speaker 2>And I tuft and I finally had to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is literally,</v>

3022
02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:06.190
<v Speaker 2>you got to like take a bottled water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freeze it in the fridge,</v>

3023
02:03:06.230 --> 02:03:11.230
<v Speaker 2>right and step on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then just sit there rolling on the </v>

3024
02:03:11.230 --> 02:03:11.230
<v Speaker 2>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You foot antiinflammatories.</v>

3025
02:03:11.230 --> 02:03:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Then you've gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you got arrested up.</v>

3026
02:03:12.130 --> 02:03:14.370
<v Speaker 4>So what is the actual injuries </v>
<v Speaker 4>attendant?</v>

3027
02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:17.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carpal tunnel for drummers.</v>

3028
02:03:17.930 --> 02:03:22.250
<v Speaker 4>I always stop and tHink about if I lived</v>
<v Speaker 4>like just 100 years ago or even less,</v>

3029
02:03:22.251 --> 02:03:27.251
<v Speaker 4>I would be useless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My body's been screwed back together so </v>

3030
02:03:27.251 --> 02:03:27.251
<v Speaker 4>many different times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody different things.</v>

3031
02:03:27.251 --> 02:03:31.841
<v Speaker 4>I've had three pretty significant knee </v>
<v Speaker 4>surgeries to reconstructions both knees </v>

3032
02:03:31.841 --> 02:03:33.350
<v Speaker 4>over the acl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Replaced this one.</v>

3033
02:03:33.351 --> 02:03:35.870
<v Speaker 4>I had my meniscus done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had my nose fixed,</v>

3034
02:03:35.871 --> 02:03:38.930
<v Speaker 4>my nose was broken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows how many fucking times.</v>

3035
02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:42.890
<v Speaker 4>So they had a scoop out all the shit out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of my nose and a deviated septum repair.</v>

3036
02:03:43.370 --> 02:03:48.370
<v Speaker 4>I stop and think about it like if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if modern science wasn't around modern </v>

3037
02:03:48.370 --> 02:03:48.410
<v Speaker 4>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be fuck you be an ogre.</v>

3038
02:03:48.940 --> 02:03:51.230
<v Speaker 4>I'll be living under a bridge a bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>crippled.</v>

3039
02:03:51.260 --> 02:03:56.260
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be able to do anything for </v>
<v Speaker 4>without fear of my legs given out and </v>

3040
02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:56.660
<v Speaker 4>popping out and fall onto the ground and</v>
<v Speaker 4>in agony.</v>

3041
02:03:57.720 --> 02:03:58.920
<v Speaker 4>That's just what people did back then.</v>

3042
02:03:59.010 --> 02:03:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've been dead.</v>

3043
02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:02.430
<v Speaker 2>My appendix ruptured in the sixth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would've been.</v>

3044
02:04:02.431 --> 02:04:03.840
<v Speaker 2>It would've been a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3045
02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:06.930
<v Speaker 2>One of those cakes ruptures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>

3046
02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Your parents tell you to go take a nap </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't believe it.</v>

3047
02:04:12.340 --> 02:04:15.570
<v Speaker 2>And then finally they'd take it down </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and you,</v>

3048
02:04:15.571 --> 02:04:16.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you almost die.</v>

3049
02:04:17.530 --> 02:04:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always present yourselves for that </v>

3050
02:04:22.530 --> 02:04:22.530
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just didn't believe,</v>

3051
02:04:22.530 --> 02:04:23.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3052
02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:25.680
<v Speaker 2>My brothers convinced I was playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>baseball and that's what happened.</v>

3053
02:04:25.681 --> 02:04:30.681
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just kept having like side pain and </v>

3054
02:04:30.681 --> 02:04:31.470
<v Speaker 2>then then the next day I would feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

3055
02:04:31.471 --> 02:04:33.390
<v Speaker 2>Then I have a fever and then I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel fine.</v>

3056
02:04:34.050 --> 02:04:36.300
<v Speaker 2>And then one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it just burst.</v>

3057
02:04:36.990 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it crazy that what</v>

3058
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:42.370
<v Speaker 4>your appendix is an organ that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>use anymore because it's used to meet.</v>

3059
02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:45.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So evolve past bone,</v>

3060
02:04:45.691 --> 02:04:49.080
<v Speaker 4>breaking doWn bone is your is your urine</v>
<v Speaker 4>or in Oregon?</v>

3061
02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:51.270
<v Speaker 4>I thought your organs like the liver,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pancreas,</v>

3062
02:04:51.690 --> 02:04:52.440
<v Speaker 4>google,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intestines.</v>

3063
02:04:52.441 --> 02:04:57.441
<v Speaker 4>Find out what the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure that would intestine is </v>

3064
02:04:57.441 --> 02:05:01.040
<v Speaker 4>not a test in the appendix rather would </v>
<v Speaker 4>appendix is is an organ that we used to </v>

3065
02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:04.380
<v Speaker 4>use when we processed meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we processed much more raw meat.</v>

3066
02:05:04.770 --> 02:05:07.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was when we ate leaves,</v>

3067
02:05:07.380 --> 02:05:09.900
<v Speaker 4>that was bone phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

3068
02:05:09.901 --> 02:05:14.901
<v Speaker 4>look at it between the three of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have a fucking clue if it's </v>

3069
02:05:14.901 --> 02:05:19.671
<v Speaker 4>something that we're evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're evolving so we don't use it </v>

3070
02:05:19.671 --> 02:05:24.381
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>WHich is pretty fascinating when you </v>

3071
02:05:24.381 --> 02:05:24.381
<v Speaker 4>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually mean.</v>

3072
02:05:24.381 --> 02:05:28.460
<v Speaker 4>It couldn't have been that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like clear evidence that the human </v>

3073
02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:30.780
<v Speaker 4>body is adapting to its environment and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then we literally don't use this fucking</v>

3074
02:05:30.781 --> 02:05:33.000
<v Speaker 4>Oregon anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes it blows up in your body,</v>

3075
02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.940
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what it does right?</v>

3076
02:05:35.941 --> 02:05:39.200
<v Speaker 4>It just fucking suicide bombs.</v>

3077
02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:40.480
<v Speaker 2>I would've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've died too,</v>

3078
02:05:40.481 --> 02:05:45.481
<v Speaker 2>that there's a couple of things I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have died if I broke my arm when I was </v>

3079
02:05:45.481 --> 02:05:45.481
<v Speaker 2>six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got hit by a car.</v>

3080
02:05:45.740 --> 02:05:47.460
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was the 18 hundreds,</v>

3081
02:05:47.461 --> 02:05:48.700
<v Speaker 2>I would have died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I get hit by it,</v>

3082
02:05:48.750 --> 02:05:52.170
<v Speaker 2>like getting hit by that car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 hundreds was hit by a car.</v>

3083
02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:57.260
<v Speaker 2>I didn't look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was racing my brother home and he had </v>

3084
02:05:57.260 --> 02:05:57.260
<v Speaker 2>stronger legs than I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3085
02:05:57.260 --> 02:05:58.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured if I cross,</v>

3086
02:05:58.141 --> 02:06:02.190
<v Speaker 2>I was sure I looked and I just do right </v>
<v Speaker 2>out in front of a jeep.</v>

3087
02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:04.920
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had video because I stIll don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know how I didn't get run over.</v>

3088
02:06:04.921 --> 02:06:09.921
<v Speaker 2>All I remember was being upside down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling the heat of the engine and </v>

3089
02:06:09.921 --> 02:06:11.160
<v Speaker 2>seeing the bumper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my.</v>

3090
02:06:11.370 --> 02:06:15.770
<v Speaker 2>And then the next thing I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was lying perpendicular to the,</v>

3091
02:06:15.771 --> 02:06:17.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the double lines.</v>

3092
02:06:17.850 --> 02:06:20.670
<v Speaker 2>I was only out for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like belzer when he got choked out.</v>

3093
02:06:20.671 --> 02:06:23.670
<v Speaker 2>it was only off for a second because </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I came to,</v>

3094
02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:25.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest dude,</v>

3095
02:06:26.140 --> 02:06:31.140
<v Speaker 2>sonia life gets out of this jeep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably had nightmares because of </v>

3096
02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:34.700
<v Speaker 2>the way I just wrote out in front of me </v>
<v Speaker 2>already crying.</v>

3097
02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:36.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

3098
02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:40.490
<v Speaker 2>and I all I could think was my dad's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to fucking kill me.</v>

3099
02:06:40.491 --> 02:06:43.700
<v Speaker 2>and I got up and I ran a only thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking happened.</v>

3100
02:06:43.701 --> 02:06:48.701
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that other than I got knocked </v>

3101
02:06:48.701 --> 02:06:48.701
<v Speaker 2>out was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3102
02:06:48.710 --> 02:06:49.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing here,</v>

3103
02:06:49.631 --> 02:06:54.631
<v Speaker 2>if you bite down on your back teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing that goes in and out on the </v>

3104
02:06:54.631 --> 02:06:54.631
<v Speaker 2>side of your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>THat's right where I got hurt.</v>

3105
02:06:54.631 --> 02:06:57.470
<v Speaker 2>So I had to eat with a little spoon for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of days.</v>

3106
02:06:57.471 --> 02:07:02.471
<v Speaker 2>I remember it happened on a wednesday </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the doctor says you don't have </v>

3107
02:07:02.471 --> 02:07:02.471
<v Speaker 2>to go to school for the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

3108
02:07:02.471 --> 02:07:03.710
<v Speaker 2>And I was psyched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I finally didn't have to fake school and</v>

3109
02:07:03.711 --> 02:07:05.510
<v Speaker 2>I had fucking thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friday,</v>

3110
02:07:05.511 --> 02:07:06.710
<v Speaker 2>saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sunday off.</v>

3111
02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:07.750
<v Speaker 2>It was totally worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

3112
02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:12.940
<v Speaker 4>it was one of the reasons why I stopped </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting is because when I was </v>

3113
02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:12.940
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3114
02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:13.130
<v Speaker 4>there was many nights where couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>chew my food.</v>

3115
02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:18.790
<v Speaker 4>I'd come home and I literally couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>chew all because too much side of the </v>

3116
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:22.301
<v Speaker 4>head and I would get headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd lay in bed at night and get fUcking </v>

3117
02:07:22.301 --> 02:07:22.301
<v Speaker 4>viciouS headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was not fun.</v>

3118
02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:25.400
<v Speaker 4>Scary shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>funded.</v>

3123
02:07:36.431 --> 02:07:38.840
<v Speaker 3>right up right up until fifth grade and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then all the.</v>

3124
02:07:38.850 --> 02:07:42.310
<v Speaker 3>I went from being one of the bigger kids</v>
<v Speaker 3>to one of the smaller kids and then also</v>

3125
02:07:42.311 --> 02:07:47.311
<v Speaker 3>kids started getting to be like a buck </v>
<v Speaker 3>20 and kind of knowing how to throw a </v>

02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:56.580
<v Speaker 4>bunch of dudes who had brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew a bunch of dudes from boxing gyms</v>

3129
02:07:56.640 --> 02:07:59.250
<v Speaker 4>that had brain damage wasn't too </v>
<v Speaker 4>significant,</v>

3130
02:07:59.251 --> 02:08:02.330
<v Speaker 4>but it was enough that you could see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had seen guys from uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and every</v>

3194
02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:39.220
<v Speaker 1>time I'd run with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker would mount me and </v>

3195
02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:39.220
<v Speaker 1>choked me and armbar me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would tap me three,</v>

3196
02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:41.360
<v Speaker 1>four times and I was exhausted just over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and over and over again.</v>

3197
02:10:41.361 --> 02:10:43.400
<v Speaker 1>He would tap me now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't hurt me.</v>

3198
02:10:43.401 --> 02:10:43.960
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3199
02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:49.000
<v Speaker 2>What was the level of frustration coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>from being a national champion and </v>

3200
02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:49.270
<v Speaker 2>ongoing</v>

3201
02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:51.310
<v Speaker 1>was it was eyeopening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3202
02:10:51.311 --> 02:10:56.311
<v Speaker 1>there was one of the reasons why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped doing taekwondo is because </v>

3203
02:10:56.311 --> 02:10:58.471
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't punch to the head and the </v>

3204
02:10:58.471 --> 02:10:58.471
<v Speaker 1>tournament's and I started kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started working with.</v>

3205
02:10:58.471 --> 02:11:02.490
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy named joe lake was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing coach in boston and he was </v>

3206
02:11:02.490 --> 02:11:05.791
<v Speaker 1>training at the same gym that I was at </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was offering me to teach me </v>

3207
02:11:05.791 --> 02:11:09.721
<v Speaker 1>boxing if I would teach him how to kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we sort of made this little deal </v>

3208
02:11:09.721 --> 02:11:13.151
<v Speaker 1>and we'll work back and forth with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and I started boxing and as I </v>

3209
02:11:13.151 --> 02:11:15.751
<v Speaker 1>started boxing I realized how bad my </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands were from taekwondo and then I'm </v>

3210
02:11:15.751 --> 02:11:19.171
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've wasted all my time doing this </v>

3211
02:11:19.171 --> 02:11:20.700
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when I go box with guys and </v>

3212
02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:20.700
<v Speaker 1>kickbox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking terrible with my hands.</v>

3213
02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:22.360
<v Speaker 1>So I started getting really good at my </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands and working on it.</v>

3214
02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:27.510
<v Speaker 1>So I'd already been enligHtened to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that my original path was not the </v>

3215
02:11:27.510 --> 02:11:28.360
<v Speaker 1>best path in the world and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why I stopped fighting.</v>

3216
02:11:28.510 --> 02:11:33.510
<v Speaker 1>I stopped fighting and taekwondo </v>
<v Speaker 1>tournament because I realized how silly </v>

3217
02:11:33.510 --> 02:11:36.091
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how easy it was for people to punch me </v>

3218
02:11:36.091 --> 02:11:36.091
<v Speaker 1>in the face and how many techniques </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't work.</v>

3219
02:11:36.091 --> 02:11:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Once you added punching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when the ultimate fighting </v>

3220
02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:40.030
<v Speaker 1>championship came along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized like,</v>

3221
02:11:40.060 --> 02:11:41.740
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look what this fucking guy does.</v>

3222
02:11:41.741 --> 02:11:42.440
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3223
02:11:42.490 --> 02:11:44.920
<v Speaker 1>hoists gracie just takes guys down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>strangles them.</v>

3224
02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:46.750
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck would I do if that guy got</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

3225
02:11:47.070 --> 02:11:47.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

3226
02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:50.680
<v Speaker 1>So I started doing jujitsu and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a rank beginner.</v>

3227
02:11:50.681 --> 02:11:53.110
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrestled one year in high school,</v>

3228
02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:55.750
<v Speaker 1>so I knew how to throw bodies around a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

3229
02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:00.960
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know how to defend myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>against anybody who's any good and this </v>

3230
02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:01.330
<v Speaker 1>kid just mangled me over and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he never really hurt me,</v>

3231
02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:06.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this was kickboxing and he did that </v>

3232
02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:06.480
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would've given me brain damage,</v>

3233
02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:07.450
<v Speaker 1>but my face knocked me out.</v>

3234
02:12:07.690 --> 02:12:09.700
<v Speaker 1>But this guy just choked me and I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>tapped and yarn,</v>

3235
02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:10.540
<v Speaker 1>pardon me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I tapped.</v>

3236
02:12:10.690 --> 02:12:13.390
<v Speaker 1>But he's not really hurting you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time he's doing this to you,</v>

3237
02:12:13.391 --> 02:12:16.360
<v Speaker 1>just tap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just emotionally devastating.</v>

3238
02:12:17.710 --> 02:12:20.200
<v Speaker 1>You don't realize until you roll with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who's good,</v>

3239
02:12:20.230 --> 02:12:22.140
<v Speaker 1>how a guy who's like that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3240
02:12:22.150 --> 02:12:27.150
<v Speaker 1>high level purple builds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a strong guy can just do whatever the </v>

3241
02:12:27.150 --> 02:12:27.150
<v Speaker 1>fuck he wants to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like literally,</v>

3242
02:12:27.150 --> 02:12:29.680
<v Speaker 1>you have no defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's almost nothing you can do if you</v>

3243
02:12:29.681 --> 02:12:34.681
<v Speaker 1>don't punch him and knock him </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious as he's grabbing a hold of </v>

3244
02:12:34.681 --> 02:12:34.681
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once it grabs You,</v>

3245
02:12:34.681 --> 02:12:35.590
<v Speaker 1>you're a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a victim.</v>

3246
02:12:36.170 --> 02:12:41.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like if you get grabbed by </v>

3247
02:12:41.170 --> 02:12:41.170
<v Speaker 2>like a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a wild animal,</v>

3248
02:12:41.170 --> 02:12:41.930
<v Speaker 2>it's a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They grab your button down,</v>

3249
02:12:41.950 --> 02:12:44.320
<v Speaker 2>your worse for the bear finished.</v>

3250
02:12:44.420 --> 02:12:47.480
<v Speaker 1>You imagine what it must feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a photo that a guy took.</v>

3251
02:12:47.650 --> 02:12:48.140
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3252
02:12:48.220 --> 02:12:50.030

<v Speaker 1>He was killed by this bear,</v>

3253
02:12:50.210 --> 02:12:55.210
<v Speaker 1>but he got one last photograph of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>female charging him because he was a </v>
