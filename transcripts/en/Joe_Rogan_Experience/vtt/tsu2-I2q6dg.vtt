This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by stamps.com

2
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.470
if you go to stamps.com and click on the upper lip,

3
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.040
there's a photograph of an old school microphone.

4
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.740
You know the kind that everybody likes to use in photographs.

5
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.770
Nobody likes to use those stupid things in practice because they suck,

6
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.480
but for whatever reason there's a certain piece of nostalgia that's connected to

7
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:37.830
one of those old school microphones like the birth of the beast,

8
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.301
like that's,

9
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:38.850
that's,

10
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.960
that's the origin of it.

11
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:41.760
So for whatever talking into a microphone,

12
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:42.594
people love that,

13
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.770
but click on that thing.

14
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:48.771
It's an icon and enter in the code word j r e just for Joe Rogan experience and

17
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.740
stamps.com is an awesome thing to have if you are running a personal business.

18
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:04.980
If you have a small business and you work for yourself and maybe you're an

19
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:05.460
artist,

20
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.170
maybe you send things online.

21
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.450
Going to the post office is a huge drag for people.

22
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.950
And with something like stamps.com you can buy and print official us postage

23
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:15.600
using your own computer and printer.

24
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.440
Uh,

25
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.951
if you,

26
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:17.190
uh,

27
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.620
by any of Brian's a kitty cat tee shirts,

28
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.940
those death squad shirts,

29
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.230
death squad.tv,

30
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.891
he sends every,

31
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:25.890
all this stuff for like anything.

32
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:27.930
He sells bumper stickers,

33
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.770
tee shirts,

34
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.090
all that stuff goes through stamps.com and he used to have to do it at the going

35
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:34.500
to the post office and waiting in line.

36
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:35.700
It's a huge pain in the ass.

37
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.541
So it's really easy.

38
00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:37.570
You do it all on your,

39
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.060
your own home computer.

40
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.530
You have a digital scale,

41
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:41.364
you weigh everything out,

42
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.690
but the postage on it,

43
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.740
mailman picks it up.

44
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.340
Boom,

45
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.173
you're done.

46
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.721
And again,

47
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:46.680
use the code word j,

48
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:48.930
r e and you'll save yourself some cash.

49
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.790
We're also brought to you by hover.

50
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.860
Hover is a domain name company that's owned by the same people that own Tang and

51
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:57.150
you know how much we love them.

52
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.140
Um,

53
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.910
hover has the same sort of principles.

54
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.270
Hover is a really easy website to use.

55
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.350
Very intuitive.

56
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.550
I actually have domains that I have personally registered through hover,

57
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:10.830
so I have actual experience doing it.

58
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:13.980
And if a monkey like me can pull it off with no hitches,

59
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.150
you can't too.

60
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.780
They also offer good stuff like they give you free things like,

61
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:18.990
uh,

62
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.520
who is domain name.

63
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.000
Um,

64
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.030
I identity guard where your anonymity,

65
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.650
so you don't have to,

66
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:26.450
um,

67
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.800
the actual words privacy who has domain name privacy.

68
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.660
But it's,

69
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.870
that's basically what it is like.

70
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:34.800
So if you have some freaky website and you don't want people to know where you

71
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:35.634
live,

72
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.410
which is probably a good idea,

73
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.190
uh,

74
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.240
they will do that for free.

75
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.380
Whereas other companies,

76
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.890
uh,

77
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.940
who is domain named privacy is actually something that you have to pay for it,

78
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:44.790
which is kind of silly.

79
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.470
If you go to hover.com forward slash Rogan,

80
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:53.490
you will save 10% off your domain name registrations.

81
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:54.271
All right,

82
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:54.860
to go there,

83
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.693
you're freaks.

84
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.650
And we're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com as always.

85
00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.080
Um,

86
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.760
I've always searched for a way to describe what a on it's supposed to be and uh,

87
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:04.280
it's,

88
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.010
it's like a human performance website.

89
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.510
What we sell is all stuff that we find to be beneficial,

90
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:12.490
whether it's for fitness,

91
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:17.380
like a kettle bells and battle ropes and weight vests and medicine balls and

92
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.310
Chin up bars and all sorts of things that I think are very beneficial for,

93
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:21.610
for,

94
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.950
for fitness to dictate your body in shape,

95
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:28.610
to do things to foods like hemp protein powder and mall walnut,

96
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.100
almond cashew butter.

97
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.420
We,

98
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.420
we try to just sell you a bunch of healthy shit like whatever hemp protein bars,

99
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.920
which are really delicious and nutrient dense.

100
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.391
And I think,

101
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:40.990
um,

102
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.220
the idea behind the company is just sell shit that you would use Michelle sell

103
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:46.210
shit that you would,

104
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.770
you would buy and you would use.

105
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.281
And a,

106
00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:50.050
that's essentially what it is.

107
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.790
If you use a code name Rogan,

108
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:56.110
you will save 10% off any and all supplements seating that quick and get through

109
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:56.441
that shit,

110
00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:57.274
Jamie.

111
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.060
Oh,

112
00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.840
that was quick.

113
00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.440
That was,

114
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.490
that was like professional.

115
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.091
All Right,

116
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:01.924
ladies and gentlemen,

117
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.640
Graham Hancock is here and,

118
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.870
uh,

119
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.000
I can't tell you how fucking pumped I am to talk to you sir.

120
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.410
And Cue the music.

121
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.000
Let's get this party rolling.

122
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.670
<v 2>Well,</v>

123
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.940
good experience

124
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.210
Graham Hancock.

125
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.840
Alright,

126
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.673
sorry.

127
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.280
Just

128
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.610
<v 3>fine.</v>

129
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.121
You've,

130
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:27.870
um,

131
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.160
you've kicked the green bench.

132
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.010
Yes.

133
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.540
After a 24 year intense relationship with the,

134
00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:37.080
uh,

135
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.630
the green goddess or the Green Bitch,

136
00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:41.160
depending on what mood she's in,

137
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.750
I had to stop.

138
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.530
Um,

139
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.363
and uh,

140
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.230
I've come in for some,

141
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.490
I've commenced for some,

142
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.910
for some criticism for this and that.

143
00:04:49.911 --> 00:04:50.190
And,

144
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.410
and I feel it's important to say that,

145
00:04:54.411 --> 00:04:54.810
uh,

146
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.410
I hugely value and a love cannabis.

147
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.400
I think it's a wonderful herbal ally and I think that,

148
00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:06.150
I don't think that I would ever have written my books off historical mystery if

149
00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:09.690
I had not encountered cannabis rather late in life.

150
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.720
I did not smoke any dope until I was 37 years old and I'm now 62 wire and,

151
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:16.500
uh,

152
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.420
roughly rather by the age of 38.

153
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:22.440
That's when I started getting into historical mysteries or that it was all,

154
00:05:22.441 --> 00:05:24.120
of course it's total stoner stuff.

155
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.030
Before that it was all carried,

156
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:27.681
the fairs,

157
00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:28.500
you know,

158
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.801
so,

159
00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:31.170
but suddenly something opened up for me and I'm very,

160
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:33.210
and I'm very grateful to the herb for that.

161
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.120
And initially my real,

162
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.290
I again,

163
00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:38.280
I need to emphasize this.

164
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.580
I think the problem I eventually ended up having with cannabis,

165
00:05:41.581 --> 00:05:42.810
it's not the fault of cannabis,

166
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:44.760
it's the fault of Graham Hancock.

167
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.920
I think my relationship became abusive with the herb.

168
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.170
It was not initially.

169
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.770
Initially it was something I would do evenings and weekends.

170
00:05:52.771 --> 00:05:56.070
I would not try to write while I was actually stoned.

171
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.010
I would do my days

172
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.280
<v 4>work and then chill out in the evening with a pipe or a joint.</v>

173
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.790
That was,

174
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.970
that was how it was for me for quite awhile.

175
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.160
And I went through my first big historical mystery book,

176
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:08.330
the sign and the seal,

177
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.940
uh,

178
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.810
which was published in 1992 with that pattern.

179
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.280
In other words that I would be,

180
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.390
I would be smoking only after I down tools at the end of the evening.

181
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:18.740
And I was ready to chill.

182
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.670
Um,

183
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.750
and that worked fine.

184
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:22.250
But then when I started,

185
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.970
when I started writing fingerprints of the gods,

186
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:27.280
which was the biggest book I've,

187
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.340
I've ever done,

188
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:30.550
a 5 million copy bestseller all around the world,

189
00:06:30.551 --> 00:06:31.940
when I started writing that I thought,

190
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:33.020
I'll experiment.

191
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.340
Let's see if I can be stoned and right.

192
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.830
And I discovered that I could,

193
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.190
I couldn't be started right.

194
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.560
And I like being stuck so much that in a way it,

195
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.840
it,

196
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.890
it urged me to just write all the time,

197
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:49.160
you know,

198
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.120
because then I had this,

199
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:53.090
I had this incredibly good reason to be stoned all the time.

200
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.210
And um,

201
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.880
it took away all the physical boredom of sitting there in my chair in front of

202
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:00.620
my computer screen,

203
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.060
just everything went away.

204
00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:02.691
And I went into,

205
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:07.691
drifted into this space where I could explore ideas and manifest those ideas

206
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:08.510
down,

207
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.440
down on the page.

208
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.670
And I literally,

209
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:15.620
that's when I began what was to become ultimately an abusive relationship with

210
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:16.071
cannabis,

211
00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:18.440
which I would fire up in those days,

212
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:22.880
might my joint or my pipe at a nine or 10 in the morning.

213
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.043
And I would,

214
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.310
I'm a hard worker.

215
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.870
I work 16 hours a day,

216
00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:27.980
very often when I'm writing.

217
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:29.570
So come two o'clock the next morning,

218
00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:31.640
I'd still be there smoking away.

219
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.103
Um,

220
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.970
and as the years went by,

221
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.930
this became a permanent daily pattern for me.

222
00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:40.430
Whether I was writing or not,

223
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.960
I would be stoned from the moment I got up until the moment I went to bed.

224
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.690
And most people who came by my house or talk to me on the phone,

225
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:50.240
they would have had absolutely no idea because I was,

226
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.980
I was completely in control.

227
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.200
I didn't seem hi,

228
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.420
I could hold a rational conversation.

229
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.081
I was,

230
00:07:57.081 --> 00:07:58.010
I was just fine.

231
00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:58.551
Um,

232
00:07:58.551 --> 00:07:59.330
and I've just felt,

233
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.410
I just felt really good.

234
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.960
And this is how it went on for many years.

235
00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:03.021
Uh,

236
00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:06.500
later on about in the early [inaudible] 2005,

237
00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:06.831
actually,

238
00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:07.850
I think perhaps a little earlier,

239
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.440
one of my kids told me that,

240
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:09.711
you know,

241
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:10.191
this stuff,

242
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:11.150
this smoke is,

243
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.220
you don't need to have combustion products.

244
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:14.690
Why don't you use a vaporizer?

245
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.970
So I bought myself a volcano

246
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.870
on the Internet and,

247
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.733
and um,

248
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:25.820
and then I heard that the British government was going to ban the use of ban all

249
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:26.654
peripherals.

250
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.520
So I bought myself two more volcanoes.

251
00:08:28.521 --> 00:08:29.600
Volcanoes are quite expensive,

252
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:33.530
but that shows how dedicated I was covering your bases.

253
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.420
I had to make sure that I covered my bases.

254
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:35.680
Um,

255
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.590
and then I would be vaporizing from nine in the morning until two o'clock the

256
00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:40.131
next morning,

257
00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:42.830
seven days a weekend and increasingly strong strains.

258
00:08:42.831 --> 00:08:45.980
And this is one thing that I would say if we lived in a regime and irrational

259
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:50.510
regime where there was no attempt by the government to police our states of

260
00:08:50.511 --> 00:08:51.344
consciousness,

261
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.860
we could have much more choice in the kind of cannabis we get hold of for,

262
00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:00.230
I would have liked to have canvas with much more CBD and maybe less THC with the

263
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:03.390
varieties I were smoking were very,

264
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:04.290
very THC,

265
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.340
THC,

266
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.850
uh,

267
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:06.670
loaded.

268
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.010
What's the difference in effect?

269
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:08.491
Well,

270
00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:08.881
okay.

271
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:09.714
I mean the,

272
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.820
it depends how much you buy into the research on this,

273
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:12.150
but,

274
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.090
but the law,

275
00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.480
a lot of good science has been done.

276
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:20.400
And the suggestion is that THC can promote a,

277
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.480
or reveal.

278
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.140
I don't want to see,

279
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.250
I don't want to blame the herb.

280
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.500
Anything I,

281
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.590
it can reveal certain psychotic tendencies in oneself.

282
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.440
And this is the well known paranoia,

283
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.010
which,

284
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:32.843
which uh,

285
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.060
many people associate with,

286
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.220
with smoking cannabis.

287
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.200
The CBD is an antipsychotic agent.

288
00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.450
So the natural herb is balanced with CBD and THC and,

289
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.490
and it looks after you very well,

290
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.950
but where are we going into intensive breeding of the herb,

291
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.350
focusing on the element that makes you really high,

292
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:50.580
which is the THC.

293
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:51.840
Then we get,

294
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.170
uh,

295
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.330
get a herb that is somewhat unbalanced as a result of the interference of a,

296
00:09:56.331 --> 00:09:56.560
of,

297
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.393
of humanity and,

298
00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:57.890
and,

299
00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:58.290
and,

300
00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.880
but you get more bang for your buck.

301
00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:00.151
You know,

302
00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:00.984
that's a very,

303
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.400
that's a very strong herb.

304
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:06.630
And I began to like a particular variety called cheese.

305
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.300
I think it's called cheese because it smells like,

306
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:09.991
you know,

307
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:11.490
old socks or,

308
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:11.911
or,

309
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:12.570
um,

310
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.350
Stilton you know,

311
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.430
like a blue cheese.

312
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.810
And a,

313
00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:20.811
I found a grower who lived local to me who was just had an amazing green fingers

314
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:21.291
and,

315
00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:24.150
and I would buy from him and,

316
00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:24.720
um,

317
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.950
and I would sometimes have,

318
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:26.251
you know,

319
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:29.430
five or six ounces of the herb in my house cause I was blazing through this

320
00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:31.920
stuff at the vendors at a tremendous rate.

321
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.680
That's enough to you where you could get in trouble for it.

322
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.460
So that's where the paranoia starts to become legitimate,

323
00:10:38.461 --> 00:10:38.851
you know,

324
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:40.320
because actually they can not,

325
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.890
they can break down your door and they can confiscate your home and take away

326
00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:45.570
your liberty and fuck you up forever.

327
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:46.111
You know,

328
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:47.010
they can do that.

329
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:47.221
And,

330
00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:49.650
and so every time I heard a ring at the door or,

331
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:50.251
you know,

332
00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:51.630
a car came up the street,

333
00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:52.290
I would,

334
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:52.920
I would,

335
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.220
you know,

336
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:53.461
get,

337
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:53.760
get,

338
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.350
get,

339
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:55.183
get paranoid.

340
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.880
So that was high and I was high paranoid when you were a high,

341
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:00.750
well,

342
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.640
this is one of the reasons why,

343
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:03.923
um,

344
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.823
look,

345
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.030
what happened to me was that run about 2003,

346
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:13.530
I started for reasons of research initially,

347
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:14.191
uh,

348
00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:16.600
working with Iowa Osca the,

349
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.940
the vine of souls.

350
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:18.781
This is the,

351
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:20.670
the powerful psychedelic brew,

352
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.970
which has been consumed by shamanistic cultures in the Amazon for thousands and

353
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:26.731
thousands of years.

354
00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:28.920
And it's not called the vine of souls for nothing.

355
00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:29.754
It's a,

356
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.400
uh,

357
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.081
it's a,

358
00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:35.310
it's an extraordinary portal into other realms.

359
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:35.540
And,

360
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.360
and in some ways those realms are associated with death and perhaps sort of what

361
00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:40.290
waits for us after death.

362
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.550
Nobody knows the answer to that.

363
00:11:41.551 --> 00:11:44.670
But in [inaudible] you have certain experiences relating to that.

364
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.300
And right from the beginning when I started to drink Iowasca,

365
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.070
I mean this sounds nuts to anybody who hasn't done DMT or who hasn't drunk

366
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.430
Iowasca but you do meet intelligent entities and more and more around the world,

367
00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:00.070
people drinking Iowasca I'm meeting this goddess figure.

368
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:01.660
She might appear as a serpent.

369
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.460
She might appear as a woman.

370
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.400
She might appear as some kind of panther or Jaguar,

371
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.140
a very powerful,

372
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.560
tough love kind of lady who reveals to you the truth about yourself and just

373
00:12:14.891 --> 00:12:15.161
says,

374
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:15.640
you know,

375
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.650
you fucking deal with it cause that's how you are.

376
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.340
And what the truth that was revealed to me from quite early on was my

377
00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:25.000
relationship with cannabis and got out of balance and I needed to get it back

378
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:25.511
into balance.

379
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:29.260
And of course I ignored those messages completely because I was so,

380
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:34.180
I was so much in love with my cannabis relationship that my wife said that

381
00:12:34.181 --> 00:12:35.590
really it was like a head of mistress.

382
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:36.521
You know,

383
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:39.880
who I spent all my time with was the cat was the cannabis rather than rather

384
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:40.660
than her.

385
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.400
And this went on for many,

386
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:44.350
many years now the paranoia aspect,

387
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:44.621
okay,

388
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:46.090
I'm going to bare my heart here.

389
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.830
And you know,

390
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.840
I believe in being honest,

391
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.130
the paranoia aspect began to affect my relationship with my beloved partner,

392
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.820
Santa who I just love from the bottom of my heart.

393
00:12:57.821 --> 00:12:59.980
And she is the best,

394
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:00.371
the most,

395
00:13:00.371 --> 00:13:01.570
the most pure hearted,

396
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.531
generous,

397
00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:03.131
spirited,

398
00:13:03.131 --> 00:13:04.030
loving lady.

399
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.750
It's possible,

400
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.620
possible to imagine,

401
00:13:05.621 --> 00:13:09.220
but I started to develop all kinds of suspicions about her,

402
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.200
which were completely groundless.

403
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:15.120
I started to imagine all sorts of stuff we're going on and then I started to act

404
00:13:15.121 --> 00:13:15.550
up,

405
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.100
act towards her as though those suspicions were real.

406
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:23.050
And all of this was also related to my consumption of cannabis.

407
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.360
It was not caused by my consumption of cannabis.

408
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.570
I think this is a latent aspect of my own personality.

409
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.680
It was being revealed by this over abuse of,

410
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:33.160
of the,

411
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.850
of the cannabis herb and,

412
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.040
and therefore I was making my beautiful partner's life,

413
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.750
a misery sometimes,

414
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.703
not every day,

415
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.790
but sometimes,

416
00:13:42.791 --> 00:13:44.410
and she was patiently putting up with this,

417
00:13:44.411 --> 00:13:49.411
but she was suffering and we went down to Brazil in October,

418
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.440
2011 and if I had been told when we got on that plane and went down to Brazil,

419
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.480
that when I came back two weeks later,

420
00:13:55.481 --> 00:13:57.430
I would probably never smoked cannabis again.

421
00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.800
I would have laughed in the face of the person who told me that.

422
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.080
But the encounters that I had with the spirit of Iowasca,

423
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:05.861
whatever that is,

424
00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:08.170
I'm willing to accept that there is no spirit of Iowasca,

425
00:14:08.171 --> 00:14:10.150
that it's all something we generate out of our brains,

426
00:14:10.151 --> 00:14:10.984
but for me,

427
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:15.190
she manifests as a re like a goddess and the encounters I had with that,

428
00:14:15.191 --> 00:14:16.390
and I do think she's real,

429
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.530
that's just my personal belief system and those encounters that I had were

430
00:14:20.531 --> 00:14:24.580
incredibly powerful and she took me to a place that was something like hell and

431
00:14:24.581 --> 00:14:28.870
she took me to a place that was something like the judgment scene in the ancient

432
00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:29.651
Egyptian religion.

433
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:34.540
Now the judgment scene is a place where your heart is weighed in the scales

434
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.410
against the feather of truth and harmony and cosmic justice,

435
00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:41.470
and you do not want your heart to be heavy in those skills.

436
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.290
You want to be able to look back on your life and say,

437
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.190
I did good.

438
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.440
I did not add to the misery in the world.

439
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.800
I did something worthwhile with this incredible gift of life that the gave me

440
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:52.370
and I,

441
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:52.700
and,

442
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.010
and everything you've done every second,

443
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:57.650
every minute of your life is completely transparent.

444
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.550
Every thought,

445
00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.810
every action,

446
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.190
everything you did from the moment that you became conscious until the moment of

447
00:15:04.191 --> 00:15:05.930
your death is laid out before you.

448
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:07.250
And there's no hiding from it.

449
00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:11.960
Like we great at creating illusions about our own behavior and persuading

450
00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:15.560
ourselves that we're behaving just fine in the judgment hall of Osiris,

451
00:15:15.561 --> 00:15:17.100
which is also called the hall of mark,

452
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.320
where the scene takes place.

453
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:20.810
All of that stripped away and you confront the truth.

454
00:15:20.811 --> 00:15:24.920
And I was put there and I confronted the truth about myself and I saw the way

455
00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:27.380
that I was behaving towards my partner and,

456
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:27.730
and,

457
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:28.040
and,

458
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.310
and I was shown that this had to stop otherwise,

459
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.580
otherwise I was going to pay a huge price for it.

460
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:35.660
Um,

461
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.130
it,

462
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:36.450
I,

463
00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.690
I had a series of terrifying,

464
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:40.490
terrifying experiences,

465
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:44.640
which my partner saw science I've shared with me because we were drinking Iowa,

466
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.810
get together and at a certain point entities came to her and,

467
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.740
and she had the experience of her heart being pulled out of her chest and the

468
00:15:51.741 --> 00:15:52.760
entity said to her,

469
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.700
and she thought she was going to die and the entity said to her,

470
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.940
we're going to do this to you to teach grammar lesson.

471
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.610
And Santa's communicated that to me.

472
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:06.760
And I would rank that as probably the single most terrifying night of my entire

473
00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:08.090
life.

474
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:13.090
And I've had some terrifying nights that was just absolutely scared,

475
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:14.060
rigid.

476
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:14.541
And I,

477
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:17.000
and I came out of that with,

478
00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:17.460
uh,

479
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.230
a feeling,

480
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.400
a very clear feeling in a,

481
00:16:19.401 --> 00:16:23.450
in Iowa we have sharings the next day after you've drunk the brew,

482
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.390
you share with the rest of the group that you've drunk with the experiences you

483
00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:27.141
had the night before,

484
00:16:27.141 --> 00:16:28.190
as much as you want to share.

485
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:29.660
And what I shared,

486
00:16:29.661 --> 00:16:32.870
because I still didn't believe that I could stop smoking cannabis.

487
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:38.230
What I shared was that I was going to change my relationship with cannabis and,

488
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:42.650
and to get to a place where cannabis was serving me again rather than me serving

489
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:43.484
her.

490
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.120
Um,

491
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:44.381
and,

492
00:16:44.381 --> 00:16:45.590
and that's what I believed.

493
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.120
But when I got back to England,

494
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.253
long flight,

495
00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.910
what's the first thing I do?

496
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.590
I get out my vaporizer,

497
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.910
get out of my stash,

498
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.450
fire up the vaporizer and fill an ice bag of,

499
00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.670
of the vapor.

500
00:16:59.060 --> 00:16:59.591
He says,

501
00:16:59.591 --> 00:17:00.470
warn us to articulate.

502
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.071
Well,

503
00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:01.904
I miss it.

504
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:02.541
I miss it.

505
00:17:02.541 --> 00:17:02.871
You know,

506
00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:03.320
this was,

507
00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.153
there would be,

508
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:08.060
cannabis is such a beautiful sensual ally if she's used.

509
00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:08.390
Right.

510
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.350
So do you think it's just an imbalance issue with the CBD THC ratio?

511
00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:13.370
We'll let me just,

512
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:14.480
let me just finish with what,

513
00:17:14.481 --> 00:17:15.320
with what happened to me.

514
00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.790
So I fill up the bag and I'm down there in my basement and I take the first and

515
00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:24.080
I take the first draw and I'm suddenly filled with the most intense feelings of

516
00:17:24.081 --> 00:17:25.490
horror and loading.

517
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.660
And it is exactly like I'm back in that space that ask it took me to,

518
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.360
and I try a second puff and I can't do it.

519
00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:34.070
I physically could not continue.

520
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.170
I knew that I just,

521
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.340
I just could not continue.

522
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.410
I expressed the vapor out of the bag,

523
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.660
like crumpled up the bag.

524
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:46.930
I put it away and the next day I got rid of several ounces of cannabis and I

525
00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:48.261
know,

526
00:17:48.261 --> 00:17:49.094
I know it's terrible.

527
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.140
It's a terrible thing to do,

528
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:50.600
but,

529
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:50.830
but,

530
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.360
but for me it was the right thing to do.

531
00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.560
24 years,

532
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.050
nonstop relationship with cannabis,

533
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.760
definitely abusing the herb.

534
00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.810
I had got to the point where the only rational course of action was what I was

535
00:18:01.811 --> 00:18:02.950
shown in Iowasca,

536
00:18:02.951 --> 00:18:03.611
which was to stop.

537
00:18:03.611 --> 00:18:07.300
And I don't know whether it was because there was way too much THC and not

538
00:18:07.301 --> 00:18:12.301
enough CBD or whether it was just me not being responsible for my own behavior.

539
00:18:12.731 --> 00:18:13.381
I go,

540
00:18:13.381 --> 00:18:14.051
I go around,

541
00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:14.290
you know,

542
00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.930
saying that I believe in adult responsibility and I do,

543
00:18:16.931 --> 00:18:18.690
but I don't think I was being responsible.

544
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.800
I don't think I was using the herb in a responsible way.

545
00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:24.370
I don't think I was using it in a respectful way and I paid a price for that.

546
00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:25.031
<v 5>Well,</v>

547
00:18:25.031 --> 00:18:27.430
that's very honest and forthcoming of you to,

548
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:31.090
to talk about it and it's very uncomfortable for people to,

549
00:18:31.091 --> 00:18:31.450
uh,

550
00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:35.980
to discuss mistakes they've made or passive gone down that they didn't,

551
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:36.911
for whatever reason,

552
00:18:36.911 --> 00:18:40.210
they got caught up in the momentum and they didn't see where it was hot headed

553
00:18:40.211 --> 00:18:41.830
in until they hit the wall.

554
00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:46.330
It sounds like you have a legitimate like chemical reaction to it.

555
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:48.040
It doesn't just sound like,

556
00:18:48.041 --> 00:18:48.874
um,

557
00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:53.140
it doesn't just sound like an abusive relationship because the effect that,

558
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.160
that it was having,

559
00:18:54.161 --> 00:18:57.520
the extreme paranoia fact and the unease.

560
00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.230
Do you take care of your body?

561
00:18:59.231 --> 00:18:59.950
Do you work out?

562
00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.120
Do you do any exercise

563
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:02.200
<v 4>enough?</v>

564
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:02.891
Not Enough.

565
00:19:02.891 --> 00:19:03.724
I do some,

566
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.870
I do some calisthenics.

567
00:19:04.871 --> 00:19:05.260
I don't,

568
00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.390
I don't do a whole lot of,

569
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.730
<v 5>you should do my yoga.</v>

570
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.990
How do you not do yoga?

571
00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:09.831
You should do yoga,

572
00:19:09.831 --> 00:19:10.664
man.

573
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.590
Graham Hancock Yoga has your name on it.

574
00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:13.750
<v 4>Oddly enough,</v>

575
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.150
somebodies come up to me recently and,

576
00:19:16.151 --> 00:19:18.780
and suggested I join a yoga or yoga.

577
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.861
<v 5>Listen man,</v>

578
00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:21.510
you have to join it yesterday.

579
00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:21.930
Okay.

580
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:22.763
For Real.

581
00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:27.020
It's for a guy like you because it's a way to get high without doing any,

582
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.950
any drugs I've gotten,

583
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.140
there's only one time in my whole life I did it,

584
00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:35.790
but I got so high after a yoga session that it was like,

585
00:19:35.791 --> 00:19:36.840
I just smoke weed.

586
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.730
Like I felt exactly like,

587
00:19:38.731 --> 00:19:41.610
like I just smoked a lot of weed now was sitting there in a hotel room and I was

588
00:19:41.611 --> 00:19:41.761
like,

589
00:19:41.761 --> 00:19:42.810
this is incredible.

590
00:19:42.811 --> 00:19:45.240
Like I would swear I'm high as fuck right now.

591
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:46.850
I hadn't smoked in dance.

592
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.300
Okay,

593
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.060
okay.

594
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.590
And it gives you,

595
00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:50.424
um,

596
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.590
it's a reset and it gives you a reset.

597
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.990
It gives you like a to me,

598
00:19:54.991 --> 00:19:58.440
like it gets rid of the excess in balances things out.

599
00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.190
Like three.

600
00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:00.023
You can,

601
00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:04.110
the reason why people have road rage and the reacting so strongly to nothing.

602
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:07.140
What a guy got in front of you and it's going to take you three extra seconds to

603
00:20:07.141 --> 00:20:07.890
get where you're going.

604
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.340
You go crazy and fucking dad is not him.

605
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:12.510
And that is not this the guy.

606
00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:12.931
Yes,

607
00:20:12.931 --> 00:20:14.160
maybe he shouldn't have done that.

608
00:20:14.161 --> 00:20:15.510
But there's a degree bothering you.

609
00:20:15.511 --> 00:20:16.410
Does it mean anything?

610
00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:18.631
I got in front of you.

611
00:20:18.631 --> 00:20:19.300
What's the big deal?

612
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:19.540
Yeah,

613
00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.090
that's built up.

614
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.730
It's built up and there's imbalance.

615
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.370
It's energy and balances and people and yes,

616
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:26.220
we all,

617
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:31.110
we were stuck in cubicles or doing jobs that we don't appreciate and people blow

618
00:20:31.111 --> 00:20:31.590
up.

619
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.960
And the best way to,

620
00:20:33.961 --> 00:20:34.240
uh,

621
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.180
avoid that kind of stuff to me is yoga.

622
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:37.130
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

623
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.630
Well,

624
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:38.490
but what about all the,

625
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.040
the stretching and the,

626
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.371
you know,

627
00:20:40.371 --> 00:20:42.650
the joy in my knees and my hips.

628
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:43.410
I have a high high,

629
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:44.750
my hip replaced six weeks ago.

630
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:45.601
<v 5>Oh my God,</v>

631
00:20:45.601 --> 00:20:46.890
you did six weeks ago,

632
00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:47.993
six weeks ago,

633
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.030
<v 4>six weeks ago I was in hospital.</v>

634
00:20:51.031 --> 00:20:53.610
I got a massive scar down the outside of my right thigh.

635
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.610
They replaced my replay to replace my hip,

636
00:20:56.611 --> 00:20:57.300
but I guess I wasn't,

637
00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.160
could start gently and just sort of build up.

638
00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.140
You would have to talk to an expert about that.

639
00:21:01.141 --> 00:21:03.180
Cause I don't know what physical limitations,

640
00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.600
the thought the surgery had gone well.

641
00:21:06.601 --> 00:21:07.434
And uh,

642
00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.180
I'm all set.

643
00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.390
So they told you you were running.

644
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.411
I can go running,

645
00:21:10.411 --> 00:21:11.101
I can go swimming.

646
00:21:11.101 --> 00:21:11.870
I can do anything,

647
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:12.480
you know.

648
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:12.990
Wow.

649
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.220
That's incredible.

650
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.781
That's incredible.

651
00:21:15.781 --> 00:21:18.090
And it's like it's a serious operation.

652
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:18.751
Serious operation.

653
00:21:18.751 --> 00:21:21.450
I know it's a serious operation because I helped it to stay awake during it.

654
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:22.160
Oh,

655
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:22.801
well I'm a writer,

656
00:21:22.801 --> 00:21:23.041
you know,

657
00:21:23.041 --> 00:21:24.410
I have to stuff to write about it.

658
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:24.631
Oh,

659
00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:25.470
that's hilarious.

660
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.030
Tell them that.

661
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:27.240
Yeah,

662
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:27.601
I did.

663
00:21:27.601 --> 00:21:28.434
Yeah.

664
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.780
So what they do is they give you a spinal.

665
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:31.441
Um,

666
00:21:31.441 --> 00:21:32.350
so it's an epidural.

667
00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.460
It's a bit like an epidural that women get when they're giving,

668
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.593
giving birth.

669
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.800
It's slightly different,

670
00:21:37.801 --> 00:21:39.060
but that's basically what it is.

671
00:21:39.061 --> 00:21:41.190
And that freezes the lower half of your body.

672
00:21:41.191 --> 00:21:42.720
You use the use of your legs,

673
00:21:42.721 --> 00:21:44.370
you're paralyzed and there's no,

674
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.750
there's no pain whatsoever.

675
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.900
But then because they regard the operation as a,

676
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.300
the surgery is kind of scary procedure.

677
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.320
They then give you massive dose of sedatives and you kind of go off into

678
00:21:55.321 --> 00:21:55.831
dreamland.

679
00:21:55.831 --> 00:21:57.120
So I declined those.

680
00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.060
Um,

681
00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.790
and they wouldn't actually let me look.

682
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.330
They put some kind of curtain device between my face and my hip,

683
00:22:03.331 --> 00:22:05.100
but I heard the soil.

684
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.470
Then I heard the hammering.

685
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.161
Oh Man.

686
00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:10.100
I felt like he's fairly sure.

687
00:22:10.101 --> 00:22:11.230
I had a carpenter's bench,

688
00:22:11.231 --> 00:22:11.850
you know,

689
00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:13.380
I heard them talking.

690
00:22:13.381 --> 00:22:14.220
It was interesting.

691
00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:15.630
It was an interesting experience,

692
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.000
but then very nice to come out of it,

693
00:22:18.001 --> 00:22:21.600
be fully awake afterwards and gradually the feeling comes back to your legs.

694
00:22:21.601 --> 00:22:22.230
And uh,

695
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:26.100
I spent four days in the hospital and initially I thought it was going to be

696
00:22:26.101 --> 00:22:29.190
very tough and I thought it'd be on sticks for a long time.

697
00:22:29.191 --> 00:22:31.740
But I did the physio and I just carried on working,

698
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.130
working,

699
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:33.000
edit and I'm okay.

700
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.130
I stayed awake for my first knee surgery.

701
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.330
Right.

702
00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:37.050
And uh,

703
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:38.040
while the guy was working,

704
00:22:38.041 --> 00:22:40.650
it was really weird because I was like half in it and half out of it.

705
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.240
And he was,

706
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:43.200
you know,

707
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.990
he was just a guy that was like tired of being a doctor.

708
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.530
<v 5>I really wasn't into people or whatever it was.</v>

709
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:50.080
I mean,

710
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:50.881
he fixed my knee,

711
00:22:50.881 --> 00:22:51.790
it's still fixing his day,

712
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:56.810
a Patella tendon graft or they take a slice of your Patella and they open you up

713
00:22:56.821 --> 00:23:00.490
and take a piece of bone out of your shin and a piece of bone in your kneecap.

714
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.360
And they used that to replace your interior cruciate ligament.

715
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.050
Right.

716
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:04.890
And um,

717
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.491
they,

718
00:23:05.491 --> 00:23:07.900
he puts it in there and like moves my leg around.

719
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.131
He goes,

720
00:23:08.131 --> 00:23:08.370
well,

721
00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.203
better than it was.

722
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:10.160
That's what he says.

723
00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:10.650
And he said like,

724
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:11.550
I was awake.

725
00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:11.881
Right,

726
00:23:11.881 --> 00:23:12.031
right.

727
00:23:12.031 --> 00:23:15.510
Like I don't know if he just forgot it was awake or thought I wouldn't remember.

728
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.010
But I remember him moving around like,

729
00:23:17.011 --> 00:23:17.360
well,

730
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:17.670
I don't know.

731
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:18.580
It was like,

732
00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.550
like that's it not we,

733
00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:21.670
we've got it done.

734
00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.860
A beautiful job.

735
00:23:22.861 --> 00:23:27.150
This young man will be up and walking and no time better than it was because

736
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.720
ambition,

737
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:27.841
who,

738
00:23:27.841 --> 00:23:28.750
his attitude,

739
00:23:28.751 --> 00:23:29.341
it was just like,

740
00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:31.080
so he didn't give a fuck.

741
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:35.250
And I remember visiting him to get it looked at like after,

742
00:23:35.251 --> 00:23:35.491
you know,

743
00:23:35.491 --> 00:23:38.730
he would like want to do a checkup to see how it was like months later,

744
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.050
like the guy just didn't like people he could tell had the thing,

745
00:23:43.051 --> 00:23:43.890
it's just done.

746
00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:44.521
Just done.

747
00:23:44.521 --> 00:23:46.000
There was no bedside manners.

748
00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:46.420
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

749
00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.051
He was courteous.

750
00:23:47.051 --> 00:23:48.280
He wasn't yelling at you or anything,

751
00:23:48.281 --> 00:23:49.040
but it was just,

752
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.680
you would just another piece of meat on the table.

753
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:51.400
Yeah.

754
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:51.880
It's,

755
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.140
it's weird to watch though,

756
00:23:53.141 --> 00:23:53.471
isn't it?

757
00:23:53.471 --> 00:23:54.750
Your body getting operated on

758
00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:56.640
<v 4>very strange experience to undergo.</v>

759
00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.560
And in my sense in my case has had,

760
00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:01.340
was not able to watch it because they put up occurred,

761
00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:06.350
but I heard it and the particular things that I heard were sewing

762
00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:07.523
<v 1>and hammering.</v>

763
00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.680
I saw it on a screen.

764
00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.340
Right.

765
00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:09.790
I didn't it,

766
00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:10.623
I didn't watch it.

767
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:11.830
I couldn't watch it in front of me,

768
00:24:11.831 --> 00:24:13.270
but I saw what was happening on screen.

769
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:14.351
It was crazy.

770
00:24:14.351 --> 00:24:15.370
It was real weird though.

771
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.120
They will open you up like a fish and yeah.

772
00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.480
But the hip replacement is a gigantic one.

773
00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.230
That's a big,

774
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:21.220
it's a big surgery.

775
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.100
How was it six weeks later and you're walking around like you're great.

776
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.690
Well I just have a limp at all.

777
00:24:25.691 --> 00:24:26.000
No,

778
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:26.471
<v 4>I guess I,</v>

779
00:24:26.471 --> 00:24:28.100
I guess in some ways I've,

780
00:24:28.101 --> 00:24:28.271
I've,

781
00:24:28.271 --> 00:24:30.940
I must've been reasonably fit and um,

782
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:31.700
got on.

783
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.020
You know,

784
00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:32.601
<v 1>that's good.</v>

785
00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:32.770
Cut.

786
00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:33.460
Cut Back.

787
00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.630
That's a very important,

788
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:38.380
cause I know for folks that are like overweight or have these shoes already

789
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.810
allow like a hip injury to let them get overweight.

790
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.350
Yeah.

791
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:42.850
That's a big Rican,

792
00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.540
you know,

793
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:44.590
rehabilitation.

794
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:44.931
It's a,

795
00:24:44.931 --> 00:24:45.401
it's a big,

796
00:24:45.401 --> 00:24:46.370
it's a big thing and it,

797
00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.560
and it is major surgery,

798
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.590
the end of your bone off.

799
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:50.181
<v 4>So,</v>

800
00:24:50.181 --> 00:24:51.980
so we made in a way,

801
00:24:51.981 --> 00:24:54.890
our buddies are like machines and we've got this ball and socket joint and the

802
00:24:54.891 --> 00:24:55.724
hip.

803
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.180
Um,

804
00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.390
and so the ball is on the end of the long bone.

805
00:24:59.391 --> 00:25:00.800
The femur I think it is.

806
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:01.490
And they,

807
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:02.600
so they chopped that off.

808
00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:04.010
That comes off.

809
00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.120
Okay.

810
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.440
And then the socket,

811
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:07.611
in my case,

812
00:25:07.611 --> 00:25:09.080
they were cysts in the socket,

813
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:11.930
which hollow spaces that had come in there because of the,

814
00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:12.951
the,

815
00:25:12.951 --> 00:25:14.480
the ball joint was out of,

816
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.760
was out of kilter and it was rubbing in the wrong way.

817
00:25:16.761 --> 00:25:17.511
And this is why it was called,

818
00:25:17.511 --> 00:25:17.960
it was called,

819
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.330
I was in severe pain for a year before this happened.

820
00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.970
And um,

821
00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.560
and so they put in,

822
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:28.040
what they do is they put in a titanium unit there where the socket is and they

823
00:25:28.041 --> 00:25:29.900
put it to Tanium shaft that goes,

824
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.610
that they hammered down into the bone.

825
00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:32.600
But then,

826
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.310
but then on the top of the Tanium is ceramic.

827
00:25:35.311 --> 00:25:36.770
So the actual bearings,

828
00:25:36.771 --> 00:25:37.391
both the,

829
00:25:37.391 --> 00:25:37.661
the,

830
00:25:37.661 --> 00:25:42.661
the titanium socket is lined with ceramic and the bearing that moves around in

831
00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:45.160
it and that sits on top of the detainees,

832
00:25:45.161 --> 00:25:45.651
IOM shaft,

833
00:25:45.651 --> 00:25:46.700
that's also ceramic.

834
00:25:46.701 --> 00:25:48.470
So there's no metal rubbing against metal,

835
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.540
which has caused problems in the past.

836
00:25:50.541 --> 00:25:54.110
People get fragments of metal into their bloodstream and so ceramic and ceramic

837
00:25:54.111 --> 00:25:54.944
bearings,

838
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.670
um,

839
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:56.510
and uh,

840
00:25:56.511 --> 00:25:57.380
and it's very good.

841
00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:57.861
You know,

842
00:25:57.861 --> 00:25:59.490
it works well and I'm not in pain and,

843
00:25:59.491 --> 00:25:59.930
and,

844
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:00.570
and uh,

845
00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:01.580
that very bad,

846
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.210
bad period of not being able to walk more than a quarter of a mile without

847
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:07.280
having to sit down and recover.

848
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:08.183
It's all gone.

849
00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:09.351
<v 1>It's incredible.</v>

850
00:26:09.351 --> 00:26:09.590
I mean,

851
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:12.080
how long is it going to be before we have bionic parties?

852
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:12.831
Well,

853
00:26:12.831 --> 00:26:13.820
what's already happening?

854
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.790
We're already getting burning and,

855
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.900
and this is one of the good things,

856
00:26:17.901 --> 00:26:19.940
which medical medical science had done some terrible things.

857
00:26:19.941 --> 00:26:21.500
But one of the good things it's done is,

858
00:26:21.501 --> 00:26:21.741
is,

859
00:26:21.741 --> 00:26:22.090
I mean,

860
00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:22.701
this is,

861
00:26:22.701 --> 00:26:24.140
this had happened 50 years ago.

862
00:26:24.141 --> 00:26:26.030
I would have been crippled at the age of 62.

863
00:26:26.031 --> 00:26:27.830
I couldn't have gone on with my life.

864
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.780
Eventually did in Hunter Thompson.

865
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.500
Right.

866
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.690
Who was in constant pain?

867
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.490
Pain.

868
00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:32.720
Yeah.

869
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.160
I believe he had hip replacement two,

870
00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:35.270
but it was like old school.

871
00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.201
They didn't really,

872
00:26:36.201 --> 00:26:36.440
yeah,

873
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.610
they've got a lot better.

874
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.473
A lot better.

875
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:38.720
Yeah.

876
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.980
That's the image right there.

877
00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:42.140
We're looking at it up on that screen.

878
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.680
There we go.

879
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:42.910
Yeah.

880
00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:43.930
Oh God.

881
00:26:43.931 --> 00:26:44.830
Graham Hancock.

882
00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:46.503
Louisa's.

883
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:48.863
Ooh,

884
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.240
it's crazy.

885
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.440
It's the idea that you're going to run around on that.

886
00:26:53.441 --> 00:26:55.040
That's a fake fake joint.

887
00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:59.030
<v 4>When you hammer that titanium shaft down inside the bone,</v>

888
00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:02.360
is there any danger that you could split the burn and he said,

889
00:27:02.361 --> 00:27:02.571
yeah,

890
00:27:02.571 --> 00:27:03.404
sure.

891
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.420
Sometimes split the boat,

892
00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:04.911
but he said,

893
00:27:04.911 --> 00:27:05.950
then we just turned,

894
00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.620
we just find it

895
00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.050
<v 1>with wire card.</v>

896
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:09.201
You just,

897
00:27:09.201 --> 00:27:13.880
what you fucking tied up with duct tape is so crazy.

898
00:27:13.881 --> 00:27:14.750
The Hammer,

899
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.830
a piece of metal into the s,

900
00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.500
the center with a marrow is mother fucker.

901
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.780
Yeah.

902
00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.460
Does it danger in danger?

903
00:27:22.461 --> 00:27:23.480
The leg does it.

904
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.160
Wow.

905
00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.150
That's incredible.

906
00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:26.540
It's good.

907
00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.350
It's good stuff.

908
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:32.000
And then the body just absorbs the titanium or it was part of the buddy bone

909
00:27:32.001 --> 00:27:33.760
tissue forms around as well and,

910
00:27:33.761 --> 00:27:35.210
and you're all set and mates to it,

911
00:27:35.211 --> 00:27:35.540
right?

912
00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.320
Yeah.

913
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.153
Wow.

914
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.150
That's incredible.

915
00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:42.430
<v 4>I'm pleasantly surprised by the way that this has has turned out.</v>

916
00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:43.330
I thought I like,

917
00:27:43.331 --> 00:27:45.040
I'm here in America now.

918
00:27:45.041 --> 00:27:48.370
I thought I would have to take sticks with me on this trip.

919
00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:49.390
Wow.

920
00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:50.340
I haven't had to do so.

921
00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:51.820
You planned on taking sticks?

922
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.470
I did,

923
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.250
but in the end I decided not to.

924
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.921
<v 1>It's incredible.</v>

925
00:27:54.921 --> 00:27:56.480
And you're just walking around totally normal.

926
00:27:56.481 --> 00:27:57.250
I don't want to,

927
00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.090
I have neat screws in both knees.

928
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.320
I don't know why I'm so surprised,

929
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.250
but I just,

930
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.371
I,

931
00:28:01.371 --> 00:28:02.600
for whatever reason,

932
00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.940
a hip replacement seems like an incredible,

933
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:05.171
yeah,

934
00:28:05.171 --> 00:28:06.380
it's kind of intimate as well.

935
00:28:06.381 --> 00:28:06.651
You know?

936
00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:08.240
It's right in the center in being there.

937
00:28:08.241 --> 00:28:08.930
It's kind of,

938
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:09.920
it's right next to junk.

939
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:11.023
That's what I'm saying.

940
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:14.990
I mean that sounds incredibly in the way it feels,

941
00:28:14.991 --> 00:28:15.380
you know?

942
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:15.981
That's what it is.

943
00:28:15.981 --> 00:28:16.820
There's a vulnerability.

944
00:28:16.821 --> 00:28:19.340
It's it's inches away from your penis and they're sawing.

945
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.911
Plus,

946
00:28:22.911 --> 00:28:23.420
I mean,

947
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:23.600
I said,

948
00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:23.721
well,

949
00:28:23.721 --> 00:28:25.520
since we did the business of revelations here,

950
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.490
they have to the,

951
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.510
the other thing that they have to

952
00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:31.310
<v 4>do when you go and you have the surgery for the 24 hours after the surgery is</v>

953
00:28:31.311 --> 00:28:32.360
you have to have a catheter

954
00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.420
through the penis and into the plateau.

955
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.160
Because for those first 24 hours,

956
00:28:37.161 --> 00:28:40.370
you cannot get up out of bed and you can't lift up to use a bed pans.

957
00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.520
So they stick in a catheter.

958
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:45.470
And I felt,

959
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.580
I felt I wanted that out as soon as possible.

960
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:52.400
I wanted to out as soon as possible.

961
00:28:52.401 --> 00:28:56.960
I wanted to return to autonomy over my body as quickly as possible.

962
00:28:56.961 --> 00:29:01.961
I did not want it to be subject to the whims or fantasies of others I want.

963
00:29:02.331 --> 00:29:03.890
And I made a big fuss about this.

964
00:29:03.891 --> 00:29:06.710
I wanted the catheter out the next morning and they said,

965
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:08.460
and I literally,

966
00:29:08.461 --> 00:29:13.040
it was up on a Zimmer frame than the by midday the next day and hobbling,

967
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.270
hobbling to the,

968
00:29:14.271 --> 00:29:14.510
uh,

969
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.343
to the toilet.

970
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.740
So how many days was it before he could walk?

971
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.100
So I was walking the very next day on his fight on a Zimmer frame.

972
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:22.600
Yeah.

973
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:22.820
Yeah.

974
00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:23.960
And they tell you to do this.

975
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.350
Yup.

976
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.190
You'll have to get going.

977
00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.790
You can't sit there and do nothing.

978
00:29:28.791 --> 00:29:29.541
You got to get going.

979
00:29:29.541 --> 00:29:30.590
So I walked on a Zimmer frame,

980
00:29:30.591 --> 00:29:33.380
then I walked on to two sticks and then I then one stick.

981
00:29:33.381 --> 00:29:34.840
And how long to one's to,

982
00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:35.601
oh,

983
00:29:35.601 --> 00:29:39.110
I only got rid of the one stick about 10 days ago.

984
00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:43.930
<v 1>So it was a how long in before you could do one sec?</v>

985
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:45.110
<v 4>Um,</v>

986
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.390
let's say a four and a half weeks.

987
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:48.430
<v 1>Four and a half weeks.</v>

988
00:29:48.431 --> 00:29:49.570
You just walking around with a cane?

989
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:50.030
Yeah.

990
00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:50.370
Yeah.

991
00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:50.950
Wow.

992
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:51.450
Yeah.

993
00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:52.283
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

994
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:52.920
Worth it.

995
00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.753
Worth it.

996
00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.623
I'm very happy.

997
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:58.110
I'm very happy that I had it done and that I don't have to suffer the pain cause

998
00:29:58.111 --> 00:29:59.550
I had severe osteoarthritis.

999
00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:00.660
I don't know why.

1000
00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:02.123
I mean,

1001
00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.120
we all think we're young,

1002
00:30:03.121 --> 00:30:03.360
you know,

1003
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:03.870
I,

1004
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:04.440
I feel,

1005
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.273
I feel young.

1006
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:05.490
I mean,

1007
00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.200
I'm 62 and,

1008
00:30:07.201 --> 00:30:07.721
and I,

1009
00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:09.840
I don't know why I was afflicted with this at,

1010
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.090
at an age when most people who go for hip replacement,

1011
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.380
they're into their seventies,

1012
00:30:13.381 --> 00:30:13.680
you know,

1013
00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.360
so I don't know why it hit me so hard.

1014
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.170
I liked the line from leaders of the lost Ark.

1015
00:30:19.171 --> 00:30:19.411
You know,

1016
00:30:19.411 --> 00:30:20.190
where,

1017
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:24.960
where Indiana Jones is all beat up sitting in the ships ships cabin and some

1018
00:30:24.961 --> 00:30:25.321
cabin.

1019
00:30:25.321 --> 00:30:27.630
And The lady with him comments on his appearance,

1020
00:30:27.631 --> 00:30:27.841
you know,

1021
00:30:27.841 --> 00:30:28.674
and he says,

1022
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.610
it's not the years,

1023
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:30.690
it's the mileage.

1024
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.350
And I think I put down some mileage over the years.

1025
00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:34.701
<v 1>Well,</v>

1026
00:30:34.701 --> 00:30:36.320
I know a lot of martial artists,

1027
00:30:36.321 --> 00:30:37.700
they get hip replacements.

1028
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:38.690
Mark Coleman,

1029
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:40.490
former UFC heavyweight champion,

1030
00:30:40.491 --> 00:30:43.270
just a tweeted that he's going in for a hip replacement.

1031
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:43.431
Even.

1032
00:30:43.431 --> 00:30:43.841
We're actually,

1033
00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:44.631
he's already done it.

1034
00:30:44.631 --> 00:30:47.570
And I believe Chuck Norris has had hip replacements.

1035
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.550
It's very common.

1036
00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.720
Yeah.

1037
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.210
Yeah.

1038
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.641
And I have a,

1039
00:30:50.641 --> 00:30:51.441
a buddy,

1040
00:30:51.441 --> 00:30:53.810
my friend Shuki who's a Moitai instructor,

1041
00:30:53.811 --> 00:30:57.320
I believe he was in line for a hip replacement the last time I saw him.

1042
00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:58.131
It's,

1043
00:30:58.131 --> 00:30:58.760
um,

1044
00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.590
it's a weird joint sometimes,

1045
00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:01.290
which I,

1046
00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:03.010
but the good news is it's,

1047
00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.070
it's doable.

1048
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:08.600
And after a few weeks of pain and discomfort to your back on your feet and fully

1049
00:31:08.601 --> 00:31:09.120
functional,

1050
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.340
unless the surgeon screws up,

1051
00:31:10.341 --> 00:31:13.130
which they do sometimes I wonder about guys like,

1052
00:31:13.131 --> 00:31:13.964
um,

1053
00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:14.810
uh,

1054
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:15.710
Bo Jackson,

1055
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:16.401
he was a,

1056
00:31:16.401 --> 00:31:19.910
a football player that was injured really badly and he had to get a hip

1057
00:31:19.911 --> 00:31:22.190
replacement and it basically ended his career.

1058
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.240
Uh,

1059
00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.680
he was playing football and baseball at the same time.

1060
00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.110
He was a super athlete,

1061
00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.130
like incredible athlete.

1062
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.550
But if they could have fixed him with this back then,

1063
00:31:31.551 --> 00:31:33.690
it seems like he could have continued playing football.

1064
00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.053
That's insane.

1065
00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:35.480
Yeah.

1066
00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.920
Football and an artificial hip.

1067
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.730
But why,

1068
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:38.810
why should I be shocked?

1069
00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:39.081
You know?

1070
00:31:39.081 --> 00:31:39.291
I mean,

1071
00:31:39.291 --> 00:31:41.690
we have metal tubes that fly to other countries.

1072
00:31:41.691 --> 00:31:43.610
Why should I be shocked that they can fix your,

1073
00:31:43.611 --> 00:31:44.120
your hip?

1074
00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:44.470
Yeah.

1075
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.710
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:45.040
Um,

1077
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.490
and what that comes down to is they can wear your quality of life has

1078
00:31:48.491 --> 00:31:50.890
deteriorated because of pain and the mobility.

1079
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.150
You can recapture that.

1080
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.830
You don't get your quality of life back.

1081
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:54.661
And that's what,

1082
00:31:54.661 --> 00:31:54.910
uh,

1083
00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:55.411
what I've already,

1084
00:31:55.411 --> 00:31:56.010
okay,

1085
00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:58.550
<v 1>that's another place where cannabis is a beautiful drug.</v>

1086
00:31:58.551 --> 00:31:59.384
When you're injured,

1087
00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.240
you know,

1088
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.420
just give you a sense of ease of your body.

1089
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:02.830
Yeah.

1090
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.520
It's uh,

1091
00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.060
it's for people that are in pain,

1092
00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:05.301
you know,

1093
00:32:05.301 --> 00:32:06.350
people have back problems.

1094
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.313
This is a wonderful

1095
00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:10.003
things.

1096
00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.520
<v 4>I have to say that I did wonder and I still do wonder,</v>

1097
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.360
um,

1098
00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:19.360
whether the fact that I quit cannabis in October,

1099
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:25.090
2011 and started feeling severe hip pain just three months later in the early

1100
00:32:26.991 --> 00:32:31.991
part of 2012 whether there's some connection or whether the cannabis was either

1101
00:32:32.271 --> 00:32:33.104
in some way,

1102
00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.393
um,

1103
00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:39.500
protecting me from the onset of severe osteoarthritis or whether at least was

1104
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.280
reducing

1105
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.050
<v 3>my sensitivity to the pain,</v>

1106
00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:42.950
the osteoarthritis.

1107
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:44.390
Cause that's when I started noticing it.

1108
00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.690
<v 5>So your body was just out of alignment.</v>

1109
00:32:46.691 --> 00:32:49.510
The hip was out of socket or something was wearing in a funny way,

1110
00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.573
it was wearing

1111
00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:51.361
<v 3>funny way.</v>

1112
00:32:51.361 --> 00:32:51.840
It seemed that,

1113
00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.100
that,

1114
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:52.331
that,

1115
00:32:52.331 --> 00:32:52.471
that,

1116
00:32:52.471 --> 00:32:54.060
that ball socket joint was not,

1117
00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.010
was not quite the right shape and

1118
00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:57.540
<v 5>I was just a natural,</v>

1119
00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.460
some kind of some kind of natural thing.

1120
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:04.530
When you talked about the Iowasca experience and you talked about the,

1121
00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.140
the,

1122
00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:05.541
the,

1123
00:33:05.541 --> 00:33:09.780
the goddess coming to you and that you choose to believe that it's real.

1124
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.880
Um,

1125
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.570
my,

1126
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:17.190
my thoughts on this whole what is real and what is not real thing,

1127
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:22.220
what I've been thinking lately is that it doesn't really even matter because

1128
00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:27.570
what it is is it's about the experience itself and the,

1129
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.830
the best parts of psychedelic experiences are the learning parts.

1130
00:33:31.831 --> 00:33:35.370
It sounds like so boring to people because they think like,

1131
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:35.971
oh no,

1132
00:33:35.971 --> 00:33:39.780
I thought it was going to see amazing things and I was going to watch elephants

1133
00:33:39.781 --> 00:33:41.550
fly and it was going to be,

1134
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.120
you know,

1135
00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.590
mad hallucinations,

1136
00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:44.161
which yeah,

1137
00:33:44.161 --> 00:33:45.480
it does occur sometimes,

1138
00:33:45.481 --> 00:33:46.130
but that's,

1139
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:47.550
that's not what it's really about.

1140
00:33:47.551 --> 00:33:50.880
What it's really about is about a learning experience.

1141
00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:55.880
It's about massive leaps in development of your personality and your psyche,

1142
00:33:56.191 --> 00:33:57.024
your worldview,

1143
00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:58.230
your personal view,

1144
00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.940
and these,

1145
00:33:59.941 --> 00:34:03.090
these massive leaps that happened through psychedelics,

1146
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.180
they happen exactly the same way.

1147
00:34:06.181 --> 00:34:11.181
If you really do in counter goddess or if this goddess is just conjured up by

1148
00:34:11.521 --> 00:34:14.400
your imagination in incredibly vivid detail,

1149
00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:18.720
either one is the same experience to you personally.

1150
00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:20.070
I think that's a very important point,

1151
00:34:20.071 --> 00:34:21.900
very important point because yes,

1152
00:34:21.901 --> 00:34:23.310
it might be hallucination,

1153
00:34:23.311 --> 00:34:28.020
but it is immensely beneficial or it might not be a hallucination and we might

1154
00:34:28.021 --> 00:34:31.590
not have a full account of what the fuck goes on in the human consciousness,

1155
00:34:31.591 --> 00:34:33.090
especially during altered states.

1156
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:38.570
And to aid to go one way or the other I think is absurd to do that.

1157
00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:40.570
We don't need to,

1158
00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:41.403
we don't know.

1159
00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:42.630
Here is an incredible,

1160
00:34:42.631 --> 00:34:42.790
doubly

1161
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:44.380
<v 3>valuable experience.</v>

1162
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:44.860
Yes.

1163
00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:45.040
Uh,

1164
00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:45.551
which is,

1165
00:34:45.551 --> 00:34:47.890
which is available to us and which,

1166
00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:48.430
uh,

1167
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:52.480
let's not forget that humanity has had a long relationship with these plants.

1168
00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:53.231
Uh,

1169
00:34:53.231 --> 00:34:54.040
this is,

1170
00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:54.880
this is one of the,

1171
00:34:54.881 --> 00:34:57.220
I think one of the problems again,

1172
00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:58.990
caused by the war on drugs,

1173
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.650
which is that it sought to intervene in that relationship and demonize and,

1174
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:08.430
and make it a dangerous to use them because you might get sent to prison.

1175
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:09.630
You can't get sent to prison for a,

1176
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:10.570
for a very long time.

1177
00:35:10.571 --> 00:35:11.404
People live in fear.

1178
00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:12.700
What we need is a,

1179
00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:17.140
is a nurturing society which makes it possible for people to have these

1180
00:35:17.141 --> 00:35:19.900
experiences in the safest,

1181
00:35:19.901 --> 00:35:21.340
most loving environment.

1182
00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:22.630
The love is love is key.

1183
00:35:22.631 --> 00:35:26.200
If you're feeling threatened in your head at a particular time,

1184
00:35:26.201 --> 00:35:27.034
if you're in a,

1185
00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.990
if you're in a space that that is,

1186
00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:30.870
is uncomfortable or difficult for you,

1187
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.500
chances are the psychedelic experience.

1188
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.180
We'll also be uncomfortable and difficult.

1189
00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:34.991
Um,

1190
00:35:34.991 --> 00:35:36.790
the more that you can control the space,

1191
00:35:36.791 --> 00:35:37.180
the,

1192
00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:37.900
that,

1193
00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:38.210
uh,

1194
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:42.430
you can be surrounded by others who love you and have your best interests at

1195
00:35:42.431 --> 00:35:42.760
heart,

1196
00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.760
the more likely you are to have a very beneficial experience from that.

1197
00:35:45.761 --> 00:35:49.600
And though that those beneficial experiences can and frequently do include

1198
00:35:49.601 --> 00:35:52.780
painful moments when you come to realization of,

1199
00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:56.260
of actually who you are and what and what you are.

1200
00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:56.800
And,

1201
00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.910
and this is,

1202
00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:02.640
I mean it's absolutely fundamental with Iowasca is what I call the life review.

1203
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.610
Um,

1204
00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:04.443
where you,

1205
00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.420
you see the impact of your behavior on others,

1206
00:36:07.421 --> 00:36:09.850
which previously you had insulated yourself from.

1207
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:12.460
And when you see the pain you'd caused,

1208
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:15.850
you might've felt perfectly justified at the time.

1209
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:18.400
When you see it and you see it there with that clarity,

1210
00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:21.340
it makes you strongly motivated not to do that again.

1211
00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:23.710
So it's a very important learning experience.

1212
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:24.940
They call them plant teachers,

1213
00:36:24.941 --> 00:36:26.260
they called them teachers in the Amazon.

1214
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.360
<v 5>That aspect that,</v>

1215
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:31.260
that learning from your past mistake aspects exist and a lot of psychedelics,

1216
00:36:31.261 --> 00:36:32.410
it's a core factor of,

1217
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:33.920
so I'd say it's a core factor of,

1218
00:36:33.921 --> 00:36:34.770
of all psychedelic.

1219
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.640
And I've always felt,

1220
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.271
I always felt like,

1221
00:36:36.271 --> 00:36:40.560
it's really ironic that law enforcement works against psychedelics because

1222
00:36:40.561 --> 00:36:44.940
nothing would benefit law enforcement more than psychedelics.

1223
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.530
Psychedelics were legal.

1224
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:48.620
There'd be so many less crimes.

1225
00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:49.951
First of all,

1226
00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:54.951
the drug crimes be out the door and then it would be a matter of how many people

1227
00:36:54.981 --> 00:36:56.370
are on mushrooms going to rob your house.

1228
00:36:56.371 --> 00:36:57.210
How about zero?

1229
00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:57.980
You know,

1230
00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.690
it means they would ask you for food if they were that starving.

1231
00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:01.190
Yeah.

1232
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.860
Yeah.

1233
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:06.300
I just think that we have this incredible ally,

1234
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.820
uh,

1235
00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.241
that our,

1236
00:37:07.241 --> 00:37:07.981
our culture,

1237
00:37:07.981 --> 00:37:08.701
our society,

1238
00:37:08.701 --> 00:37:13.290
we have this amazing plant thing that we've discovered in several different

1239
00:37:13.291 --> 00:37:13.711
forms.

1240
00:37:13.711 --> 00:37:14.220
Yeah.

1241
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.820
And we've made all of them outside of our reach.

1242
00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.190
We put all of them outside legal reach,

1243
00:37:20.191 --> 00:37:21.024
which is insane.

1244
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.720
It's insane.

1245
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.040
It makes you wonder what's going on.

1246
00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:23.540
Why,

1247
00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.373
why,

1248
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:28.090
why is society on this self destructive trip ignorant?

1249
00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:29.820
It's essentially with,

1250
00:37:29.821 --> 00:37:30.270
this is,

1251
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:31.103
I believe,

1252
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:31.921
and this is,

1253
00:37:31.921 --> 00:37:32.760
it sounds crazy,

1254
00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:34.440
but I believe this.

1255
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.430
I believe that psychedelics are here for human beings to take,

1256
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:42.030
to move to the next level of consciousness and they can elevate us away from our

1257
00:37:42.031 --> 00:37:42.890
war ways.

1258
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:43.410
I'm with you on,

1259
00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:44.430
I think it's the only thing,

1260
00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.290
the only thing I don't think ideology,

1261
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:51.330
morality shifts with understanding with the exchange of information.

1262
00:37:51.331 --> 00:37:52.290
I think morality,

1263
00:37:52.291 --> 00:37:54.870
escalate slowly but surely all throughout culture.

1264
00:37:54.871 --> 00:37:55.591
And eventually may,

1265
00:37:55.591 --> 00:37:59.880
we may get to a term or a time in the future where we're not war like at all.

1266
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.990
But the best way to do that is through psychedelics.

1267
00:38:01.991 --> 00:38:03.150
Psychedelics and yeah,

1268
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.030
the,

1269
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:08.700
the people who are involved in the running of things most likely are ignorant to

1270
00:38:08.701 --> 00:38:09.534
the experience.

1271
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:14.750
And so what you're dealing with is someone who is 50 60 years into a lifelong

1272
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:19.470
close to off ego trip of death and destruction.

1273
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.420
And they're the ones that are running the world,

1274
00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:22.000
unfortunately,

1275
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.500
that that's,

1276
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.170
that's why we're so fucked.

1277
00:38:25.171 --> 00:38:27.060
We're not so fucked because humans are evil.

1278
00:38:27.061 --> 00:38:29.460
And when you look around at all the nice people that you meet,

1279
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.160
you get really confused as to how the world can be so fucked up.

1280
00:38:32.161 --> 00:38:33.270
Can it be so fucked up?

1281
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.860
Because they build up basically.

1282
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.123
Yeah,

1283
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:36.980
<v 1>we're good.</v>

1284
00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.540
But the people that are running shit,

1285
00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:39.530
most of them are not good.

1286
00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:40.670
Yeah.

1287
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.960
And,

1288
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.400
and then they get like the personality types.

1289
00:38:43.401 --> 00:38:43.611
Like,

1290
00:38:43.611 --> 00:38:43.821
I mean,

1291
00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:45.110
if you want to run shit,

1292
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:48.200
then right there you've got a certain kind of personality.

1293
00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.100
Yeah.

1294
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.150
Anybody that wants to be president should not be allowed to be proud of exactly.

1295
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:54.320
Instant this qualification,

1296
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:54.610
you know,

1297
00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:55.251
you should be,

1298
00:38:55.251 --> 00:38:58.340
you'd be absolutely not wanting that job would be like the lottery.

1299
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.761
You know,

1300
00:38:58.761 --> 00:39:00.680
like you should like the public,

1301
00:39:00.681 --> 00:39:02.720
like a new president comes in every month.

1302
00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:04.520
If you do a good job,

1303
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.701
you know,

1304
00:39:04.701 --> 00:39:07.700
you get to keep the people get to vote whether we keep you for a few months.

1305
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.300
Yeah.

1306
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.560
And it's just a person.

1307
00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:13.100
You have a random qualifications as far as education,

1308
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:14.120
as far as your background,

1309
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:17.180
some power hungry EGOMANIAC who wants to push you around,

1310
00:39:17.181 --> 00:39:17.511
which is,

1311
00:39:17.511 --> 00:39:18.830
which is unfortunately the case,

1312
00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.570
the old boy network,

1313
00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:24.290
the thing that comes into place when these guys [inaudible] cronies and they all

1314
00:39:24.291 --> 00:39:27.140
help each other out and hook each other up and communicate with each other.

1315
00:39:27.141 --> 00:39:30.500
And then there's lobbyists and special interest groups and they all want to make

1316
00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:31.460
sure that this keeps going.

1317
00:39:31.461 --> 00:39:34.410
So that makes sure that the law has continued to stay on the books that allowed

1318
00:39:34.411 --> 00:39:35.450
them to deal with the stupidity,

1319
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:39.530
especially when like Congress can't be guilty of insider trading.

1320
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.580
Have you seen that?

1321
00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.413
I didn't see that.

1322
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.240
Let me Google that because I want to make sure that I'm correct.

1323
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.570
Congress not guilty of insider trading.

1324
00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.780
I think you can't accuse them of insider trading.

1325
00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:51.913
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1326
00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:53.140
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1327
00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:53.501
Oh dear.

1328
00:39:53.501 --> 00:39:54.550
Is the right way to say that?

1329
00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:54.821
Let me,

1330
00:39:54.821 --> 00:39:57.550
let me Google that to make sure that that's true.

1331
00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.133
<v 0>Congress.</v>

1332
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:02.150
<v 1>So basically they get immunity.</v>

1333
00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.140
Yeah.

1334
00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:03.440
Uh,

1335
00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.273
hold on.

1336
00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.900
I wrote it the wrong can't be,

1337
00:40:05.901 --> 00:40:06.920
maybe can't be Lt.

1338
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:08.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1339
00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.820
<v 1>Immune to insider trading.</v>

1340
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:10.270
Hmm.

1341
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:11.103
Let's try immune.

1342
00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:11.501
Yeah.

1343
00:40:11.501 --> 00:40:12.071
There's something,

1344
00:40:12.071 --> 00:40:13.840
I'm looking at some articles on this here.

1345
00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:15.490
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1346
00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:17.410
<v 1>Well politicians are always cutting themselves.</v>

1347
00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:18.730
All the slack there is,

1348
00:40:18.731 --> 00:40:19.220
you know,

1349
00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:19.670
that do,

1350
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.710
that is exactly what it is.

1351
00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:22.360
Congress believes there are,

1352
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:26.440
there are immune to insider trading laws and uh,

1353
00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:26.821
there's,

1354
00:40:26.821 --> 00:40:29.440
are there legal professors that are debating them.

1355
00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:30.850
Um,

1356
00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:31.660
and uh,

1357
00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:35.680
the legal analysis by law professor Donna Nagli of the Indiana University

1358
00:40:35.681 --> 00:40:40.360
suggest that members of Congress may not be immune to insider trading laws after

1359
00:40:40.361 --> 00:40:40.810
all.

1360
00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:43.690
Apparently there was a 60 minutes piece where they went on about this.

1361
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.970
So it's one of those legal things where apparently this is probably,

1362
00:40:46.971 --> 00:40:49.630
you have to go over it with a fine tooth comb and then find out what,

1363
00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:50.970
what exactly the staff,

1364
00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.030
how it's written.

1365
00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:52.961
It's all crazy.

1366
00:40:52.961 --> 00:40:55.210
Bunch of corrupt Boston's you.

1367
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:56.291
That's it.

1368
00:40:56.291 --> 00:40:56.741
That's it.

1369
00:40:56.741 --> 00:40:57.280
They wanted to,

1370
00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:57.880
they wanted,

1371
00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.610
they wanted to do that job because they like controlling other people.

1372
00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.930
Fact that they can say that they don't want to be prosecuted for insider

1373
00:41:04.931 --> 00:41:05.560
trading.

1374
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.280
It's like,

1375
00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.091
why is that?

1376
00:41:07.091 --> 00:41:08.020
How much are you doing?

1377
00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:08.883
How much inside?

1378
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:09.790
Guess what?

1379
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:12.070
You can come to me all day and you say,

1380
00:41:12.071 --> 00:41:12.551
Hey Joe,

1381
00:41:12.551 --> 00:41:14.530
do you think the insider trading should be illegal?

1382
00:41:14.531 --> 00:41:15.400
I'll say yes,

1383
00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.110
and if I do insider trading,

1384
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.033
prosecute me.

1385
00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:19.510
But if I'm coming out saying,

1386
00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:21.730
I don't want you to prosecute me for insider trading,

1387
00:41:21.731 --> 00:41:24.390
definitely got something to hide to fucking dude,

1388
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.233
man.

1389
00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:29.080
That's why you want it to be a congressman so you can just profit off of the

1390
00:41:29.081 --> 00:41:29.950
stock market.

1391
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:30.550
You creep.

1392
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.361
So I thought,

1393
00:41:31.361 --> 00:41:32.770
and I've made this proposal several,

1394
00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:34.010
several that,

1395
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.460
<v 3>um,</v>

1396
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.180
that what,

1397
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:35.451
you know,

1398
00:41:35.451 --> 00:41:38.000
what I would like to see is anybody running for high office,

1399
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:39.320
they first started right off.

1400
00:41:39.321 --> 00:41:40.670
They've got to do 10.

1401
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:41.710
I was concessions.

1402
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:42.710
It's a great idea.

1403
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:43.040
You know,

1404
00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:43.491
that's it.

1405
00:41:43.491 --> 00:41:43.731
That's,

1406
00:41:43.731 --> 00:41:44.420
that's the first,

1407
00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:45.380
that's the first hurdle.

1408
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.221
They've got to do that.

1409
00:41:46.221 --> 00:41:48.860
They've got to go through it and we'll see how they feel afterwards.

1410
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:50.060
Um,

1411
00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:50.860
could be 10,

1412
00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:51.170
you know,

1413
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:52.350
strong mushroom sessions.

1414
00:41:52.351 --> 00:41:53.300
So we're just as good.

1415
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.111
But,

1416
00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:54.620
uh,

1417
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:54.980
you know,

1418
00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:55.430
they've got it.

1419
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.590
They've got to be able to do that.

1420
00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:58.700
You know what's really crazy?

1421
00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.040
The solution exists

1422
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.280
<v 5>to a better world.</v>

1423
00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:03.030
It exists.

1424
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.721
It exists right here.

1425
00:42:03.721 --> 00:42:05.640
It's not like we,

1426
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.330
wow,

1427
00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:11.330
imagine if some benevolent race from another planet came down here and be gifted

1428
00:42:11.641 --> 00:42:13.710
us with some space fruit.

1429
00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:15.330
And if we eat this space fruit,

1430
00:42:15.331 --> 00:42:17.600
we'll see ourselves for who we truly are.

1431
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.140
<v 3>People hold,</v>

1432
00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:22.640
they're letting go of their responsibility for their own lives,

1433
00:42:22.641 --> 00:42:23.050
you know?

1434
00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:23.670
Yes,

1435
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:24.503
yes.

1436
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:26.410
<v 5>But if you told people that,</v>

1437
00:42:26.411 --> 00:42:27.640
that you would go,

1438
00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:28.061
wow,

1439
00:42:28.061 --> 00:42:28.960
that would be great,

1440
00:42:28.961 --> 00:42:30.790
but it's science fiction.

1441
00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:31.300
Yeah.

1442
00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:31.481
Well,

1443
00:42:31.481 --> 00:42:36.220
the exact thing exists with Iowasca psychedelic mushrooms.

1444
00:42:36.221 --> 00:42:36.640
That's true.

1445
00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.360
It exists.

1446
00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.830
And for whatever reason,

1447
00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:39.460
you know,

1448
00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.980
discussing it is a very controversial thing.

1449
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:43.510
It's very controversial.

1450
00:42:43.511 --> 00:42:43.811
Like I've,

1451
00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:46.690
I've like had producers like ask me like,

1452
00:42:46.691 --> 00:42:50.410
why are you talking about TV shows and I'm working on why are you talking about

1453
00:42:50.411 --> 00:42:51.244
illegal drugs

1454
00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:52.210
<v 3>been asked.</v>

1455
00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:54.270
I've been asked to stay away from those.

1456
00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:54.490
Yep.

1457
00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:56.130
<v 5>Chorus don't talk.</v>

1458
00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.870
You're going to fuck up this whole thing,

1459
00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.520
this ancient archeology.

1460
00:42:59.521 --> 00:43:00.420
I think you're on to something,

1461
00:43:00.421 --> 00:43:00.840
Graham.

1462
00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.520
I think you've done some good work.

1463
00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.160
Believe the mushrooms out putting exactly.

1464
00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:06.650
I've had that crash.

1465
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:07.590
Had that conversation.

1466
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.781
You don't need,

1467
00:43:09.781 --> 00:43:11.730
the mushrooms were making some money over here,

1468
00:43:11.731 --> 00:43:12.150
Graham.

1469
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.690
Yeah,

1470
00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:13.140
yeah,

1471
00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:13.470
yeah.

1472
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:13.920
It's,

1473
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:14.251
it's,

1474
00:43:14.251 --> 00:43:15.084
it exists.

1475
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:17.680
<v 3>And I think that was part of the problem with my ted talk to,</v>

1476
00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:18.560
okay.

1477
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.340
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1478
00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.560
We could live in a Narnia world.

1479
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:23.660
We could live in a world like Avatar.

1480
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.490
If everybody was doing Iowasca,

1481
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:29.330
we could pull this world together with a rapid quickness.

1482
00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:29.570
Yeah.

1483
00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:33.050
If they just broke out IOWASCA ceremonies all over the globe.

1484
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.760
If it became the next big thing,

1485
00:43:34.761 --> 00:43:35.810
sort of like cell phones.

1486
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.360
Everybody's got IOWASCA ceremony is on every corner.

1487
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:39.051
We,

1488
00:43:39.051 --> 00:43:44.051
you could change the whole world within our lifetime in an astounding loving way

1489
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:49.670
where people would abandoned so many of your ideas about business and so many of

1490
00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:54.290
their ideas about controlling resources and killing people.

1491
00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:54.921
And you know,

1492
00:43:54.921 --> 00:43:56.690
the amazing thing is that it is actually,

1493
00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:00.850
<v 3>it is actually happening admittedly on a small scale,</v>

1494
00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:01.961
but for me,

1495
00:44:01.961 --> 00:44:03.300
this is one of the mysteries of,

1496
00:44:03.301 --> 00:44:07.840
of Iowasca at a time when the Amazon jungle is under such terrible threat that

1497
00:44:07.841 --> 00:44:09.910
out of the jungle emerge these two plants,

1498
00:44:09.911 --> 00:44:11.050
one of which is a vine,

1499
00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:11.681
you know,

1500
00:44:11.681 --> 00:44:16.330
which then begins to spread her tentacles or all around the planet and to call

1501
00:44:16.331 --> 00:44:17.260
out to people.

1502
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.120
And people are drawn to Iosco.

1503
00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:22.030
I can't tell you how often I get asked a,

1504
00:44:22.031 --> 00:44:23.400
where do I go for,

1505
00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:27.790
for a good Iowasca ceremony where I know I can trust the sham on it to get it

1506
00:44:27.791 --> 00:44:27.971
again,

1507
00:44:27.971 --> 00:44:28.930
as it's happening everywhere,

1508
00:44:28.931 --> 00:44:29.890
it's happening in Japan,

1509
00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:30.993
it's happening in,

1510
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:32.820
it's happening in Germany,

1511
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:33.511
it's happening,

1512
00:44:33.511 --> 00:44:34.680
it's happening all over the world.

1513
00:44:34.681 --> 00:44:35.514
And so you get a,

1514
00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:36.320
uh,

1515
00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.010
a small but growing group of,

1516
00:44:38.011 --> 00:44:38.380
of,

1517
00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.640
of initiates who have had this shared experience.

1518
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:42.450
And uh,

1519
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:42.721
you know,

1520
00:44:42.721 --> 00:44:44.430
we kind of know each other when we meet

1521
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:49.090
<v 5>and the initiates that have had this experience are talking about it and more</v>

1522
00:44:49.091 --> 00:44:49.924
are coming.

1523
00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:53.620
It's building and building and the Io Oscar tourism and south Americans gigantic

1524
00:44:53.621 --> 00:44:53.891
now.

1525
00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:54.640
So it's really,

1526
00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.390
yeah.

1527
00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:56.360
<v 3>And I again,</v>

1528
00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.060
a number of times I stabbed up at the,

1529
00:44:58.061 --> 00:44:58.930
and I'm giving a,

1530
00:44:58.931 --> 00:45:03.380
a presentation somewhere and I'm talking about Iowasca and then somebody stands

1531
00:45:03.381 --> 00:45:03.981
up in the audience.

1532
00:45:03.981 --> 00:45:04.341
They don't,

1533
00:45:04.341 --> 00:45:08.090
you realize that by promoting Iowasca you're leading to the depletion of the

1534
00:45:08.091 --> 00:45:08.924
rain forest.

1535
00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:11.120
Quite the opposite is the truth is the case.

1536
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.770
Uh,

1537
00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:12.290
the,

1538
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:15.620
what's happened with Iowasca is the Iowaska is being massively planted in the

1539
00:45:15.621 --> 00:45:18.350
rainforest now because of Iowasca tourism.

1540
00:45:18.351 --> 00:45:20.210
Iowasca tourism is a really good thing for,

1541
00:45:20.211 --> 00:45:21.044
I'll ask it.

1542
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:23.270
It's not causing any depletion.

1543
00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:23.691
And,

1544
00:45:23.691 --> 00:45:24.201
and uh,

1545
00:45:24.201 --> 00:45:24.650
I'll ask,

1546
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:27.050
it can be grown in many different parts of the world.

1547
00:45:27.051 --> 00:45:27.561
And it is,

1548
00:45:27.561 --> 00:45:28.730
and it has been being grown.

1549
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:29.820
That's the divine.

1550
00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:30.740
So

1551
00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:31.151
<v 5>it's a,</v>

1552
00:45:31.151 --> 00:45:31.540
it's,

1553
00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:32.001
it's a really,

1554
00:45:32.001 --> 00:45:33.290
it's a fascinating subject.

1555
00:45:33.291 --> 00:45:36.500
The fact that something does exist to give you that experience.

1556
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.800
Yeah.

1557
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.730
I've always said about the,

1558
00:45:37.731 --> 00:45:39.140
the DMT experience at like,

1559
00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:43.120
if you could just show someone like what you see if you,

1560
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:43.970
without taking it,

1561
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:45.110
if you could just show someone,

1562
00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:45.560
yeah.

1563
00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.520
They would want to do it.

1564
00:45:46.521 --> 00:45:48.380
They would want to go wait a minute and it doesn't hurt.

1565
00:45:48.381 --> 00:45:49.040
You know,

1566
00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:49.840
it doesn't,

1567
00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.673
you're not going to get hurt.

1568
00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:52.130
But most people,

1569
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:53.990
most people probably shouldn't do it though.

1570
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:55.190
That's what I think.

1571
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:56.180
Also what I think,

1572
00:45:56.181 --> 00:45:57.680
and I think even baby steps.

1573
00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.340
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1574
00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:02.360
If we lived in that ideal world where we as adults have the right to make

1575
00:46:02.361 --> 00:46:04.250
sovereign decisions about our own consciousness,

1576
00:46:04.251 --> 00:46:06.350
I think most people wouldn't choose to do it.

1577
00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:06.701
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1578
00:46:06.701 --> 00:46:07.301
I think you're right.

1579
00:46:07.301 --> 00:46:07.451
Well,

1580
00:46:07.451 --> 00:46:11.500
if you look at how it is in Holland where marijuana is essentially legal and

1581
00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:12.181
nobody,

1582
00:46:12.181 --> 00:46:12.510
you know,

1583
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:16.640
like they look down upon people that get high all the time and they also look

1584
00:46:16.641 --> 00:46:20.200
down upon hard drugs because of the fact that you can get most things they

1585
00:46:20.201 --> 00:46:22.390
understand with great clarity.

1586
00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.540
What's dangerous and what's not dangerous and people are always going to make

1587
00:46:25.541 --> 00:46:26.020
bad money.

1588
00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:26.420
<v 3>That's it.</v>

1589
00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:26.610
You know,

1590
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:30.360
you just have to treat people as adults and you have to understand that some

1591
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:33.600
people will make mistakes and there will be problems,

1592
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.600
but that is that that should not be an obstacle to what,

1593
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.210
what has to be a fundamental freedom.

1594
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:43.050
<v 5>But what about allowing people into your community that sell them,</v>

1595
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:47.670
allowing people in your community of friends and neighbors that profit off of

1596
00:46:47.671 --> 00:46:51.120
the addiction of others because there are certain drugs like math.

1597
00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.330
I'm not saying that math should be illegal.

1598
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.820
I don't,

1599
00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.870
I don't know whether or not you,

1600
00:46:56.020 --> 00:47:00.120
I don't know whether or not there's a way to handle it where you get the maximum

1601
00:47:00.121 --> 00:47:00.570
benefit.

1602
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:02.430
I don't know whether it's making it illegal,

1603
00:47:02.431 --> 00:47:03.690
decriminalizing it,

1604
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.690
making it so that people can't get prosecuted for using,

1605
00:47:06.691 --> 00:47:09.600
but they can get prosecuted for selling complicated area.

1606
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:10.831
Some of these,

1607
00:47:10.831 --> 00:47:12.870
some of these substances are very harmful.

1608
00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:13.501
Personally,

1609
00:47:13.501 --> 00:47:14.610
I don't want to smoke meth,

1610
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:16.440
but if you were next door to a math guy,

1611
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:19.380
like you would not want that guy in your communities profiting off of,

1612
00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:22.470
in slaving chemical enslaving people.

1613
00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:23.310
So this is,

1614
00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:25.950
this is an area where more work has to be done.

1615
00:47:25.951 --> 00:47:26.784
But I think that,

1616
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.770
I think if we approach the problem from a spirit of love

1617
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.550
<v 3>and from a spirit of respect for the sovereignty of other adults,</v>

1618
00:47:33.551 --> 00:47:36.370
it'll be whole lot better than the way we are approaching the problem right now.

1619
00:47:36.371 --> 00:47:37.210
And as we know,

1620
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:42.390
making these toxic substances illegal doesn't prevent their use.

1621
00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:42.941
It does,

1622
00:47:42.941 --> 00:47:44.140
it absolutely does not prevent,

1623
00:47:44.141 --> 00:47:44.561
they use,

1624
00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:46.600
the use has gone up and up and up and up and up,

1625
00:47:46.601 --> 00:47:46.901
over,

1626
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:47.490
over the deck.

1627
00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:48.810
<v 5>And it's kind of unique.</v>

1628
00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:49.020
The,

1629
00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:52.710
the one of the properties of psychedelics,

1630
00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:53.410
whether it's,

1631
00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:54.240
uh,

1632
00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.080
like some per,

1633
00:47:55.081 --> 00:47:55.770
some works,

1634
00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:56.470
some forks,

1635
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.900
um,

1636
00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:01.900
Ibogaine has a great result for curing addictions in Iowasca has a great result.

1637
00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:09.060
And the people that are doing these very things in selling these very drugs,

1638
00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:10.950
both participating in both sides,

1639
00:48:10.951 --> 00:48:13.520
selling and dealing could both benefit from my Oscar.

1640
00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:14.030
Like,

1641
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.640
if you're,

1642
00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.690
if you're a meth dealer,

1643
00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.590
you're an asshole.

1644
00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:17.760
Like what an asshole.

1645
00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:17.960
You're,

1646
00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.980
you're selling something that fucking kills piano.

1647
00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:21.900
It makes them polar skin off of their face.

1648
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:22.480
Yeah.

1649
00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.313
What are you doing?

1650
00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:24.680
<v 3>One of the first,</v>

1651
00:48:24.681 --> 00:48:25.100
um,

1652
00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.470
Iowasca sessions I went to in Brazil,

1653
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:30.230
there was a guy there from la who,

1654
00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:33.860
who was a heavy smoker of crystal meth.

1655
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:34.461
Oh,

1656
00:48:34.461 --> 00:48:35.100
Jesus.

1657
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:35.933
And He,

1658
00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:36.620
um,

1659
00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:38.060
came there in a state.

1660
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:43.160
He was just so wired and he came out as we were discussing,

1661
00:48:43.161 --> 00:48:43.911
as were talking,

1662
00:48:43.911 --> 00:48:45.290
it came out that he had been,

1663
00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:49.520
he had a rival in love and he'd gone out and got a gun and he,

1664
00:48:49.521 --> 00:48:51.170
and just before he left La,

1665
00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.740
but best decision he ever made was to leave La and come down to Brazil and drink

1666
00:48:54.741 --> 00:48:55.550
IOWASCA.

1667
00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:58.400
He was getting close to the point of murdering a fellow human being.

1668
00:48:59.130 --> 00:48:59.963
Um,

1669
00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:02.000
two weeks in Brazil,

1670
00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.470
five ios sessions,

1671
00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:04.760
completely turned him around,

1672
00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:06.500
completely turned them around and,

1673
00:49:06.501 --> 00:49:10.250
and he revolutionized his life and he became such a loving,

1674
00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.331
positive,

1675
00:49:11.331 --> 00:49:11.661
warm,

1676
00:49:11.661 --> 00:49:12.650
spirited person.

1677
00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.180
And all his anger was gone.

1678
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:14.600
And,

1679
00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.760
and he moved on in his life in amazing ways.

1680
00:49:16.761 --> 00:49:17.840
And I've seen many,

1681
00:49:17.841 --> 00:49:18.111
many,

1682
00:49:18.111 --> 00:49:18.411
many,

1683
00:49:18.411 --> 00:49:18.741
many,

1684
00:49:18.741 --> 00:49:19.820
many examples of that.

1685
00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:20.810
I don't want to pretend,

1686
00:49:20.811 --> 00:49:21.644
however,

1687
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:24.710
that it's all sweetness and light in the garden.

1688
00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:25.550
Um,

1689
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:26.150
there,

1690
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:28.320
there are problems also with,

1691
00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:31.040
with Iowasca and people should be aware of this.

1692
00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:34.490
There are Shamans who are abusing their power.

1693
00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:35.301
Uh,

1694
00:49:35.301 --> 00:49:36.080
there are,

1695
00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:36.440
uh,

1696
00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:36.681
you know,

1697
00:49:36.681 --> 00:49:38.900
if you've got to a place like a ketose in Peru,

1698
00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:41.390
you'll find those two types of showman's,

1699
00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.690
one type I the cure and Darrow's there,

1700
00:49:43.691 --> 00:49:44.524
the healers,

1701
00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.610
the other type of the brew hose there.

1702
00:49:46.611 --> 00:49:49.740
So sorceress actually and um,

1703
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:54.050
they will use Iowasca to gain power over others.

1704
00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:57.320
And there have been one or two horrendous cases that occurred with this.

1705
00:49:57.321 --> 00:49:58.190
So I do think the,

1706
00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:03.760
the intention of the individuals who are involved is also an important part of

1707
00:50:04.641 --> 00:50:04.820
this.

1708
00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:05.653
And psychedelics,

1709
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:07.730
I agree with you.

1710
00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:07.981
The,

1711
00:50:07.981 --> 00:50:08.221
the,

1712
00:50:08.221 --> 00:50:08.431
the,

1713
00:50:08.431 --> 00:50:08.641
the,

1714
00:50:08.641 --> 00:50:08.841
the,

1715
00:50:08.841 --> 00:50:13.841
the single one stop shop to transform our society and make it a better place,

1716
00:50:15.501 --> 00:50:20.000
a far better place than it can be today is the correct use of psychedelics.

1717
00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:25.090
But I would be wrong to say that psychedelics are a magic potion because they're

1718
00:50:25.161 --> 00:50:25.790
not,

1719
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:26.660
and there have been,

1720
00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.620
which have misused psychedelics profoundly.

1721
00:50:30.621 --> 00:50:33.170
I would say that the Aztecs in Mexico,

1722
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.340
we're one of those.

1723
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:35.210
What did they do?

1724
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:35.571
Well,

1725
00:50:35.571 --> 00:50:36.890
they used Psilocybin,

1726
00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:42.080
but they did not use it for a gentle consciousness exploration.

1727
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:46.880
The Aztecs used psilocybin preparatory to rituals of human sacrifice.

1728
00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.130
The Aztecs,

1729
00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:48.520
uh,

1730
00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:53.510
the Aztecs used psilocybin as a vehicle to communicate with their day teas.

1731
00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:57.830
And those deities included characters like we'd sort of partially who was the

1732
00:50:57.831 --> 00:51:02.831
war God who spoke to Marty Zuma was the last Aztec emperor and a,

1733
00:51:04.011 --> 00:51:04.850
that's 15,

1734
00:51:04.851 --> 00:51:05.684
19.

1735
00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:06.280
Uh,

1736
00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.940
when Cortez appears in Mexico.

1737
00:51:07.941 --> 00:51:10.430
And what is Zuma was in daily communication with,

1738
00:51:10.431 --> 00:51:11.510
with the war God,

1739
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:15.440
by means of Psilocybin mushrooms and,

1740
00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:18.170
and what the war God was telling him to do.

1741
00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:18.591
You know,

1742
00:51:18.591 --> 00:51:20.510
there's demons out there as well as angels.

1743
00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:25.130
What the war God was telling him to do was to kill people and to stretch them

1744
00:51:25.131 --> 00:51:29.810
over a stone and cut out their hearts and their where there was a horrendous

1745
00:51:29.811 --> 00:51:31.400
situation in Tennessee state land,

1746
00:51:31.401 --> 00:51:32.540
which was the capital city,

1747
00:51:32.541 --> 00:51:33.650
which is now Mexico City.

1748
00:51:33.651 --> 00:51:34.371
As a matter of fact,

1749
00:51:34.371 --> 00:51:36.740
when they inaugurated the great pyramid,

1750
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:38.600
reliable accounts,

1751
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:43.960
80,000 people were sacrificed to the god of war and four days in four days,

1752
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.340
80,000 people.

1753
00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:47.361
Now this is a,

1754
00:51:47.361 --> 00:51:51.510
this is a bloody awful thing that was going on there and psychedelics were in

1755
00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:51.730
Boston.

1756
00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:53.510
I'm not saying that psychedelics caused it,

1757
00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:54.171
and again,

1758
00:51:54.171 --> 00:51:55.220
we come to this issue,

1759
00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:56.420
is it,

1760
00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:00.980
are these entities that we encounter projections of our own minds or are there,

1761
00:52:00.981 --> 00:52:02.330
is there some other level,

1762
00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:06.770
more realm or level of existence where nonphysical entities that communicate

1763
00:52:06.771 --> 00:52:08.660
with us at the level of consciousness exist?

1764
00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:09.470
Uh,

1765
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:10.370
whichever it is,

1766
00:52:10.371 --> 00:52:11.990
whether it's a projection of our own minds,

1767
00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:12.860
as you rightly say,

1768
00:52:12.861 --> 00:52:16.400
or whether those entities are real is less important than the effects on our

1769
00:52:16.401 --> 00:52:16.851
behavior.

1770
00:52:16.851 --> 00:52:21.851
But if what is being projected from our own mind is very dark and negative and

1771
00:52:22.311 --> 00:52:23.030
wicked,

1772
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:28.030
or if those entities also include evil angels as well as good guys,

1773
00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:32.090
then you can get cultures misled down this path.

1774
00:52:32.091 --> 00:52:33.770
And I do believe that's what happened with the,

1775
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:34.873
with the Aztecs.

1776
00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.250
There's also recently,

1777
00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:37.083
and again,

1778
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:39.020
I think truth is really important.

1779
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.340
Truth is really important.

1780
00:52:40.341 --> 00:52:41.630
So let's be truthful about this.

1781
00:52:41.631 --> 00:52:42.440
Also,

1782
00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.990
there have been some tragic cases with the,

1783
00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:47.000
with Iowasca most recently in Chile,

1784
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.631
uh,

1785
00:52:47.631 --> 00:52:48.020
which,

1786
00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.060
which actually involved the human sacrifice,

1787
00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:51.190
which actually involved the,

1788
00:52:51.191 --> 00:52:51.461
the,

1789
00:52:51.461 --> 00:52:52.680
the burning to death of a,

1790
00:52:52.681 --> 00:52:57.681
of a baby on the instructions of the so-called Gulu or Sharman who formed the

1791
00:52:58.461 --> 00:52:59.300
kind of death cult,

1792
00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:01.220
but their sacrament was Iowasca.

1793
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:02.300
Um,

1794
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:03.560
this is very rare,

1795
00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:06.920
but it does happen and I think people should be aware when they enter Iowasca

1796
00:53:06.921 --> 00:53:10.130
space that one of the things I was good does is it makes you more suggestible.

1797
00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.600
It opens your heart,

1798
00:53:11.601 --> 00:53:12.231
it makes you,

1799
00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:12.640
it makes,

1800
00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:12.900
if,

1801
00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:13.671
if a powerful,

1802
00:53:13.671 --> 00:53:16.580
strong negative personality comes along and says to you,

1803
00:53:16.581 --> 00:53:17.031
do this,

1804
00:53:17.031 --> 00:53:17.421
do this,

1805
00:53:17.421 --> 00:53:17.811
do this,

1806
00:53:17.811 --> 00:53:18.201
do this,

1807
00:53:18.201 --> 00:53:18.830
do this.

1808
00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:19.790
You might just do it.

1809
00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:21.260
And that's,

1810
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:22.460
that is also their possible.

1811
00:53:22.461 --> 00:53:23.294
So you have to,

1812
00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:25.010
you have to be strong in yourself.

1813
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:26.490
You have to be clear on your intent.

1814
00:53:26.491 --> 00:53:26.740
And,

1815
00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:26.951
and,

1816
00:53:26.951 --> 00:53:27.221
and,

1817
00:53:27.221 --> 00:53:29.800
and if you're not going into this with good intent,

1818
00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.020
then bad things also can happen.

1819
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:32.761
<v 5>Well,</v>

1820
00:53:32.761 --> 00:53:32.881
I,

1821
00:53:32.881 --> 00:53:37.881
I just also wonder what would it be like to introduce psychedelics into the

1822
00:53:38.071 --> 00:53:43.071
insane warlike environment of Aztec Mexico and the 15 hundreds?

1823
00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:44.221
I mean,

1824
00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:44.550
what,

1825
00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:48.330
what would it have been like this living back then and what,

1826
00:53:48.331 --> 00:53:53.160
what would it take to become a PR person of royalty,

1827
00:53:53.161 --> 00:53:55.260
an emperor or king in those days?

1828
00:53:55.261 --> 00:53:56.910
It was insane.

1829
00:53:56.911 --> 00:53:57.660
Bloodshed.

1830
00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:58.500
<v 3>It's just insane.</v>

1831
00:53:58.501 --> 00:53:58.980
Bloodshed.

1832
00:53:58.980 --> 00:53:59.280
Theirs,

1833
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.010
they were very dark and demonic culture.

1834
00:54:02.011 --> 00:54:03.180
And unfortunately,

1835
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:08.910
that demonic aspect of avast tech culture was without any shadow of a doubt

1836
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:11.040
mediated by psilocybin mushrooms.

1837
00:54:11.041 --> 00:54:12.440
And they called them [inaudible],

1838
00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:13.950
which means the flesh of the gods.

1839
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:18.330
And they were used for communication with demonic entities.

1840
00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:18.840
And,

1841
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.260
um,

1842
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.040
um,

1843
00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:20.730
we cannot,

1844
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:22.110
we cannot pretend that that was not,

1845
00:54:22.111 --> 00:54:23.880
so this was the case.

1846
00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:25.140
And indeed,

1847
00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:25.340
if,

1848
00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:30.340
if the Aztecs had not been those people who murdered their neighbors,

1849
00:54:30.451 --> 00:54:32.700
who use their neighbors as a sort of farm.

1850
00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:32.941
I mean,

1851
00:54:32.941 --> 00:54:37.941
if you imagine a society which was run by serial killers and in the interest of

1852
00:54:39.091 --> 00:54:39.900
serial killers,

1853
00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:44.900
that's roughly as tech society and 1519 so they would have neighboring tribes

1854
00:54:45.251 --> 00:54:46.230
who they would pray on.

1855
00:54:46.231 --> 00:54:47.940
They could easily have completely defeated them,

1856
00:54:47.941 --> 00:54:49.770
but they preferred not to completely defeat them.

1857
00:54:49.771 --> 00:54:52.620
They preferred to use them for warfare every year,

1858
00:54:52.621 --> 00:54:53.460
make war on them,

1859
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.510
take captives,

1860
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:58.020
bring the captors back to Tennessee tech lab and cut out their hearts.

1861
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:59.580
And this is why there's Karma.

1862
00:54:59.581 --> 00:55:00.750
There's such a thing as Karma.

1863
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:01.280
Well,

1864
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.120
this is why Montezuma was brought down,

1865
00:55:03.121 --> 00:55:03.361
I mean,

1866
00:55:03.361 --> 00:55:08.340
490 Spaniards turn up on the coast of Mexico and destroy a standing army of

1867
00:55:08.341 --> 00:55:09.420
200,000 men.

1868
00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:10.590
Why does that happen?

1869
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:13.560
It happened because the neighbors of the Aztecs hated the Aztecs.

1870
00:55:13.561 --> 00:55:14.760
They utterly hated them.

1871
00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:15.550
And,

1872
00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:17.730
and they were looking for liberation from that,

1873
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.160
from that horror that was being in.

1874
00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.010
<v 5>Isn't that a better,</v>

1875
00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:23.163
isn't that?

1876
00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:23.890
No,

1877
00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:24.611
I shouldn't say better,

1878
00:55:24.611 --> 00:55:29.611
but isn't a possibility that what you're dealing with is a bunch of sociopaths

1879
00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:34.750
and a bunch of crazy people.

1880
00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:39.780
And if you introduce psilocybin into their system in this insane warlike world,

1881
00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.900
that where you're conjuring up is their imagination.

1882
00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:44.891
And it is the,

1883
00:55:44.891 --> 00:55:45.310
the,

1884
00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:46.060
the inner,

1885
00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:46.381
I mean,

1886
00:55:46.381 --> 00:55:51.381
the desire to manifest these things that we ask them to do horrible things.

1887
00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:57.110
And this is a core behavior pattern in human beings when they get in control of

1888
00:55:57.551 --> 00:55:58.350
armies.

1889
00:55:58.350 --> 00:55:58.550
Yeah.

1890
00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:03.520
It is absolute complete total ruthlessness as barbaric behavior is,

1891
00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.140
not only is it,

1892
00:56:05.141 --> 00:56:06.610
is it beneficial,

1893
00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:07.720
but it's necessary.

1894
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:09.000
It's applauded.

1895
00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:09.311
Yeah.

1896
00:56:09.311 --> 00:56:09.941
It's applauded.

1897
00:56:09.941 --> 00:56:10.681
It's necessary.

1898
00:56:10.681 --> 00:56:11.680
When does your metals,

1899
00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:12.790
and if you don't do it,

1900
00:56:12.791 --> 00:56:14.110
someone around you is going to do it.

1901
00:56:14.111 --> 00:56:14.960
So you have to do it.

1902
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:15.320
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1903
00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:16.470
So there's the,

1904
00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:18.180
there's the interesting question right there.

1905
00:56:18.181 --> 00:56:18.361
I mean,

1906
00:56:18.361 --> 00:56:19.980
we have armies now in the world today,

1907
00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:23.070
which are going out doing murderous stuff.

1908
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:23.590
Right.

1909
00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:24.070
Um,

1910
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:25.600
<v 1>and so the question is if we,</v>

1911
00:56:25.601 --> 00:56:29.950
if we were to be in such a position that we could massively introduced

1912
00:56:29.951 --> 00:56:31.210
psychedelics into those,

1913
00:56:31.211 --> 00:56:32.044
into those armies,

1914
00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.300
would it actually make them worse or better?

1915
00:56:34.301 --> 00:56:34.541
This is,

1916
00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:36.010
I'm not sure what the answer is.

1917
00:56:36.011 --> 00:56:36.341
You know,

1918
00:56:36.341 --> 00:56:36.641
I'm not,

1919
00:56:36.641 --> 00:56:40.090
I'm not sure what the very honest of you to not be sure that is the,

1920
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:41.950
I think there's no way that we,

1921
00:56:41.951 --> 00:56:42.520
sure.

1922
00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.510
We know that the,

1923
00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:44.920
the Vikings Ma,

1924
00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:47.350
they berserker on mushrooms,

1925
00:56:47.351 --> 00:56:47.981
they will use it.

1926
00:56:47.981 --> 00:56:48.860
How many of them are scary?

1927
00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:49.500
So scary?

1928
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:49.621
I,

1929
00:56:49.621 --> 00:56:50.000
yeah.

1930
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:50.740
Yeah.

1931
00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:51.970
I never had much luck with that.

1932
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:53.020
Me Neither.

1933
00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:53.351
Yeah.

1934
00:56:53.351 --> 00:56:56.290
That's what I hear from a lot of people felt weird.

1935
00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:57.400
You want to have luck with it.

1936
00:56:57.670 --> 00:57:00.010
You've got to pass it through urine,

1937
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:00.640
urine,

1938
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:04.630
even pass it through a reindeer or through or through the bladder of a showman,

1939
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:06.380
vandal WIC.

1940
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:09.430
You know how convenient you have to drink.

1941
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:10.263
Sharman pissed.

1942
00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:11.231
Yeah.

1943
00:57:11.231 --> 00:57:13.810
That's the thing that they always say you have to recycle your urine.

1944
00:57:13.811 --> 00:57:14.320
I'm like,

1945
00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:18.700
this is though the middle of the body functions as a filter and it removes set

1946
00:57:18.701 --> 00:57:19.630
and impurities,

1947
00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:22.210
which then allow the good stuff to remain.

1948
00:57:22.211 --> 00:57:23.160
And that comes through in your,

1949
00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:25.990
and apparently you can pass it through seven human bodies that doesn't lose.

1950
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:26.780
Hey,

1951
00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:27.910
easy.

1952
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.960
Um,

1953
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:29.860
I know a,

1954
00:57:29.861 --> 00:57:31.960
a buddy who did it and he uh,

1955
00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.850
he was on mushrooms and they told him to drink his urine.

1956
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:35.200
He's like,

1957
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.220
I am so high right now.

1958
00:57:36.221 --> 00:57:37.420
I did not need to drink my urine.

1959
00:57:37.421 --> 00:57:37.780
And they're like,

1960
00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:38.261
trust me,

1961
00:57:38.261 --> 00:57:39.094
drink your urine.

1962
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:40.690
And he said he drank his urine.

1963
00:57:40.691 --> 00:57:43.210
It was like just getting shot through a cyclone.

1964
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.641
Boom.

1965
00:57:44.641 --> 00:57:48.640
He said the whole thing just took some incredible path.

1966
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:49.120
Yeah.

1967
00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.470
From drinking his own urine.

1968
00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:50.711
Yeah.

1969
00:57:50.711 --> 00:57:52.540
I must say that's not an experience I've had.

1970
00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:54.390
What would welcome that.

1971
00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:55.960
But that's what the research shows.

1972
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:58.100
I have drunk my own urine on several occasion.

1973
00:57:58.480 --> 00:57:58.781
Yeah.

1974
00:57:58.781 --> 00:57:59.231
Just to see,

1975
00:57:59.231 --> 00:57:59.690
cause I,

1976
00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:02.560
I read about year in therapy so I wanted to find out what it was about.

1977
00:58:02.561 --> 00:58:03.570
Like does it,

1978
00:58:03.571 --> 00:58:03.820
yeah.

1979
00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:06.610
Does it really make you feel better when you're sick and it did work.

1980
00:58:06.611 --> 00:58:07.720
But it might've been totally,

1981
00:58:07.721 --> 00:58:08.740
might've been placebo.

1982
00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:09.520
I Dunno.

1983
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.810
But there was one time when I was sick and I took it.

1984
00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:13.600
I called my friend Yana,

1985
00:58:13.601 --> 00:58:13.961
but I'm like,

1986
00:58:13.961 --> 00:58:14.171
dude,

1987
00:58:14.171 --> 00:58:15.530
I track my own piss off work.

1988
00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:17.140
It was just,

1989
00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:18.940
it was crazy cause he was like big on it,

1990
00:58:18.941 --> 00:58:19.720
you know,

1991
00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.190
cause you're in therapy and we'll taste,

1992
00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:24.250
it doesn't taste nearly as bad as you would think it tastes.

1993
00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:29.110
The idea is a lot worse than the actual reality of it is hard to cross.

1994
00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:30.730
But it's just like warm water.

1995
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:34.390
It's not horrific tasting gag a little when you smell it,

1996
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:35.890
you know like you can't believe when I drank this.

1997
00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:37.360
But once you're actually drinking it,

1998
00:58:37.361 --> 00:58:37.900
it's really,

1999
00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:38.860
it's not that big a deal.

2000
00:58:38.861 --> 00:58:40.360
I'm haven't done in a long time.

2001
00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:44.560
I don't want to say like the Leo Machida who's a famous UFC fighter,

2002
00:58:44.561 --> 00:58:47.290
he drinks his own urine every morning and there's another guy,

2003
00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:48.220
Juan Manwell,

2004
00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:50.350
mark as a famous boxer from Mexico.

2005
00:58:50.351 --> 00:58:50.850
Same thing.

2006
00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:51.880
He was drinking his own,

2007
00:58:51.881 --> 00:58:52.714
I think he quit.

2008
00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:55.350
He gave up and you guys might as well have some laminated NASCAR.

2009
00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:55.541
Yeah.

2010
00:58:55.541 --> 00:58:56.050
And then,

2011
00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:56.441
yeah,

2012
00:58:56.441 --> 00:58:57.310
you might as well.

2013
00:58:57.311 --> 00:58:58.144
And even then,

2014
00:58:58.660 --> 00:58:59.493
yeah,

2015
00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:01.840
I wonder if when you're,

2016
00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:04.960
when a person goes completely psycho,

2017
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.460
when you're living in war.

2018
00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:08.380
And one of the things about the Mexicans,

2019
00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:10.900
the Aztecs rather as a,

2020
00:59:10.901 --> 00:59:12.400
I don't even think they had horses yet.

2021
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:13.001
No,

2022
00:59:13.001 --> 00:59:13.510
they didn't.

2023
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.931
This is,

2024
00:59:13.931 --> 00:59:18.931
this is one of the reasons again why a relatively small force of Spaniards were

2025
00:59:19.421 --> 00:59:22.280
able to defeat them was because the horse

2026
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.580
<v 3>had been extinct in the Americas for 12,000 years.</v>

2027
00:59:25.770 --> 00:59:26.180
Wow.

2028
00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.830
From the end of the last ice age.

2029
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:30.980
And so when the Spanish turned up with actually only 16 horses,

2030
00:59:30.981 --> 00:59:31.910
16 heavy,

2031
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.390
heavy hunters that were trained for,

2032
00:59:35.391 --> 00:59:36.224
for warfare,

2033
00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:36.921
uh,

2034
00:59:36.921 --> 00:59:41.240
European armies that had thousands of years to develop strategies to deal with

2035
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:43.410
men on horseback and they were dead.

2036
00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:47.060
They were definite specific tactics and responses that you used when you were

2037
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:48.253
charged.

2038
00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:49.153
But the,

2039
00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.750
the Maya and the Aztecs,

2040
00:59:50.751 --> 00:59:52.560
they had no idea what they were looking at there.

2041
00:59:52.561 --> 00:59:53.151
They actually,

2042
00:59:53.151 --> 00:59:54.230
if you look at their accounts,

2043
00:59:54.231 --> 00:59:54.591
which I've,

2044
00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:55.221
which I've done,

2045
00:59:55.221 --> 00:59:59.180
you'll find that they initially thought that they were dealing with supernatural

2046
00:59:59.181 --> 00:59:59.631
beings,

2047
00:59:59.631 --> 01:00:00.464
which we're part,

2048
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:01.970
part deer actually.

2049
01:00:01.971 --> 01:00:04.700
Cause that was the nearest animal that they could relate to a horse park,

2050
01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:05.840
deer and part human.

2051
01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:06.680
Um,

2052
01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:06.881
and,

2053
01:00:06.881 --> 01:00:10.550
and they did a know how to handle these things and they,

2054
01:00:10.551 --> 01:00:10.731
you know,

2055
01:00:10.731 --> 01:00:13.340
they're coming down at you at 25 or 30 miles an hour.

2056
01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:14.810
They're covered in armor,

2057
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:15.351
uh,

2058
01:00:15.351 --> 01:00:16.550
the horse and the man.

2059
01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:17.120
And,

2060
01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.220
and it's a pretty terrifying prospect.

2061
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:23.870
And they broke armies of tens of thousands of men where we'd just fled in terror

2062
01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:24.561
at the,

2063
01:00:24.561 --> 01:00:25.700
at the site of these,

2064
01:00:25.701 --> 01:00:25.850
uh,

2065
01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:27.620
these entities charging down on them.

2066
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:28.910
Eventually they learned.

2067
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.080
Um,

2068
01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:34.940
and there's a famous case that one of the tribes in Mexico that fought most

2069
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.310
vigorously against Montezuma,

2070
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:39.050
where people called the class Collins.

2071
01:00:39.051 --> 01:00:42.230
He used them for human sacrifice and they're very independent spirited people,

2072
01:00:42.231 --> 01:00:43.064
great warriors.

2073
01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:46.130
And you would've thought when the Spanish came into Mexico,

2074
01:00:46.131 --> 01:00:49.250
that the first people who would become their allies would be the plus gallons.

2075
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:50.361
But in fact,

2076
01:00:50.361 --> 01:00:54.830
that plus gallons had a heroic character called Chica Tanka who was their battle

2077
01:00:54.831 --> 01:00:55.310
king.

2078
01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:58.100
And he saw the future and he saw what,

2079
01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:00.380
what Spain would eventually due to Mexico.

2080
01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.750
And so initially and very hard,

2081
01:01:02.751 --> 01:01:07.010
he fought the Spanish tooth and nail for over a long campaign that lasted about

2082
01:01:07.011 --> 01:01:07.844
six weeks.

2083
01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:08.660
Um,

2084
01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:09.560
and during that,

2085
01:01:09.561 --> 01:01:11.540
during that campaign on one,

2086
01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:12.381
on one occasion,

2087
01:01:12.381 --> 01:01:17.381
one of his warriors actually took the head off a horse with a single blow of

2088
01:01:18.381 --> 01:01:18.951
their weapon,

2089
01:01:18.951 --> 01:01:20.330
which was a bit like a sword.

2090
01:01:20.331 --> 01:01:21.164
It was made of wood.

2091
01:01:21.370 --> 01:01:22.700
It was called a macro wheedle.

2092
01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:26.390
And it had flakes of obsidian lined along the edges of the blade.

2093
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.760
And that horse was not wearing armor that day.

2094
01:01:28.761 --> 01:01:29.810
And the horse was beheaded,

2095
01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.680
shocked the Spanish.

2096
01:01:30.681 --> 01:01:31.280
It was the first time.

2097
01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.720
Suddenly there was proof for the people in front of them that these animals were

2098
01:01:35.721 --> 01:01:36.650
not supernatural,

2099
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:37.543
that they could be,

2100
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:38.930
that they could be killed.

2101
01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.793
And uh,

2102
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:40.820
but eventually,

2103
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.570
you know,

2104
01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:42.980
Cortez was a terrorist.

2105
01:01:42.981 --> 01:01:45.410
He went around massacring called villages.

2106
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:47.540
He burned people at the stake.

2107
01:01:47.541 --> 01:01:49.580
He Fed people to dogs.

2108
01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:53.450
And eventually the coolest Carlin's did the calculation and they said,

2109
01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.900
we better join this guy rather than carry on with this.

2110
01:01:56.901 --> 01:02:01.040
And so eventually they did join forces with him and suddenly he had 100,000

2111
01:02:01.041 --> 01:02:06.041
auxiliaries who were ready to take a Moctezuma on Jesus Christ.

2112
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:06.830
Who's cute.

2113
01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:09.410
Imagine living back then extraordinary times,

2114
01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:11.030
and I have to say,

2115
01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:11.930
although I,

2116
01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:16.970
although I really detest a lot of the things that the Spanish did,

2117
01:02:16.971 --> 01:02:20.130
I have to say those 490 they had balls

2118
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:20.963
<v 4>of steel.</v>

2119
01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:21.780
You know,

2120
01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:22.830
they had balls of steel.

2121
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:23.843
I mean to turn,

2122
01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.690
to turn up on this distant coast with no resources,

2123
01:02:27.691 --> 01:02:28.441
no reserves,

2124
01:02:28.441 --> 01:02:29.580
nothing to fall back on.

2125
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:31.790
And to know that you're confronting a,

2126
01:02:31.791 --> 01:02:35.370
an enemy that is a militaristic power that has hundreds of thousands of men

2127
01:02:35.371 --> 01:02:40.371
under arms that sacrifices you if it catches you and still to go for it.

2128
01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:45.300
That takes tremendous coach Cortez actually scuttled all his ships so that his

2129
01:02:45.301 --> 01:02:46.380
men could not flee.

2130
01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:47.640
The ships were scuttled.

2131
01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:48.271
What does that mean?

2132
01:02:48.271 --> 01:02:49.260
It's cuddled sunk.

2133
01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:50.460
He sunk them.

2134
01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:51.121
Put holes in them.

2135
01:02:51.121 --> 01:02:51.690
Yeah,

2136
01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:52.950
we put holes in them and sunk them.

2137
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:54.180
And gangster.

2138
01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:54.540
And,

2139
01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:54.811
and,

2140
01:02:54.811 --> 01:02:56.460
and then he said this is it.

2141
01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:57.360
There's no going back.

2142
01:02:57.361 --> 01:02:58.171
Jesus Christ,

2143
01:02:58.171 --> 01:02:58.950
we conquer,

2144
01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:01.710
we conquer or we or we die.

2145
01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:03.240
Fucking psycho.

2146
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:03.430
Yeah.

2147
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:04.171
So total psycho.

2148
01:03:04.171 --> 01:03:07.500
So it's been interesting for me cause this is my latest writing effort,

2149
01:03:07.501 --> 01:03:08.130
has been,

2150
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:10.920
has been a novel about the Spanish conquest of Mexico these days.

2151
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.690
I do novels as well as nonfiction.

2152
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.950
It's been interesting for me to get inside the head of a man like Cortez to get

2153
01:03:16.951 --> 01:03:18.950
inside the head of a man like Moctezuma.

2154
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:19.540
Uh,

2155
01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:20.311
and to add,

2156
01:03:20.311 --> 01:03:21.330
to figure out what,

2157
01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.730
what drove them and what,

2158
01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:23.670
what made these,

2159
01:03:23.671 --> 01:03:24.600
these characters,

2160
01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:24.871
what,

2161
01:03:24.871 --> 01:03:25.270
what they,

2162
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:25.861
what they were.

2163
01:03:25.861 --> 01:03:27.300
And I have a witch in the story,

2164
01:03:27.301 --> 01:03:28.170
a young Aztec,

2165
01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:28.531
which,

2166
01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:32.400
and I have a famous woman called Molenaar who became Cortez Lover,

2167
01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:33.390
um,

2168
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:35.790
who had a grudge against Montezuma history.

2169
01:03:35.791 --> 01:03:36.690
Doesn't tell us why,

2170
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:40.350
but I give her a motive in the story cause he tried to sacrifice.

2171
01:03:40.351 --> 01:03:41.760
It's kind of cool that you can do that with history,

2172
01:03:41.761 --> 01:03:43.380
can do that with history and you can't,

2173
01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:44.400
you can do that with fiction.

2174
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:46.180
And so she,

2175
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:47.430
she's a key player in the,

2176
01:03:47.431 --> 01:03:48.630
in not just in my story,

2177
01:03:48.631 --> 01:03:51.240
but in the story of history because she became Cortez interpreter.

2178
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:52.680
She was very clever.

2179
01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.120
She learned Spanish very,

2180
01:03:54.121 --> 01:03:57.810
very fast and she would be so in the paintings from those days,

2181
01:03:57.811 --> 01:04:01.890
you always see her standing beside Cortez and coming out of her mouth is the

2182
01:04:01.891 --> 01:04:03.270
glyphs that means speech.

2183
01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:04.070
And,

2184
01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:06.960
and she gave the whole story away to Cortez.

2185
01:04:06.961 --> 01:04:09.480
She told Cortez how to defeat Montezuma.

2186
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:12.750
And that was to play on the myth of [inaudible] collateral of the feathered

2187
01:04:12.751 --> 01:04:17.751
serpent who would return and bring in a new age and overthrow a wicked king.

2188
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:21.610
And she had Cortez fill the boots of quite sarco apple.

2189
01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:23.093
Wow.

2190
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.340
How did you get so involved in the Aztec culture?

2191
01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:26.850
Just,

2192
01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:27.683
it's so fast.

2193
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:31.470
This is the book by the way.

2194
01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:32.610
Oh God.

2195
01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:33.030
Yeah.

2196
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:33.863
Yeah.

2197
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:34.703
This is it.

2198
01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:35.760
Um,

2199
01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:40.760
when I was researching fingerprints of the gods back in the early nineties,

2200
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.770
um,

2201
01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:48.770
I traveled extensively and widely in Mexico as part of my research because

2202
01:04:49.921 --> 01:04:51.900
Mexico is a fascinating place from the,

2203
01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:54.060
from the point of view of a lost civilization.

2204
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.601
You know,

2205
01:04:54.601 --> 01:04:59.550
we have the old mech culture we have for these that those gigantic stone heads,

2206
01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:00.420
um,

2207
01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:03.180
from a site that's thought to be three and a half thousand years old.

2208
01:05:03.181 --> 01:05:07.200
I think it's probably much older than that on the Gulf of Mexico heads in the

2209
01:05:07.201 --> 01:05:08.430
form of African heads,

2210
01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:09.840
which is very puzzling and weird.

2211
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:10.680
Um,

2212
01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:11.580
but also,

2213
01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:12.803
uh,

2214
01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:13.860
images of,

2215
01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:16.800
of people with very strongly Caucasian features with,

2216
01:05:16.801 --> 01:05:18.160
with massive beards.

2217
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:18.820
<v 3>Um,</v>

2218
01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:20.800
definitely not American Indian faces.

2219
01:05:20.801 --> 01:05:21.270
And there they are.

2220
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:22.420
So I was wondering,

2221
01:05:22.421 --> 01:05:26.590
are these the remnants of some lost civilization because history does not

2222
01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:29.850
explain how individuals with that appearance ever turned up in a,

2223
01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:30.693
in Mexico.

2224
01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:34.450
And I inadvertently,

2225
01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:37.210
as I was researching fingerprints of the Gods in Mexico,

2226
01:05:37.211 --> 01:05:42.211
I inadvertently traveled the route of Cortez and I found myself again and again

2227
01:05:43.421 --> 01:05:48.421
crossing the path that Cortez had taken from the Gulf of Mexico up to what is

2228
01:05:49.031 --> 01:05:50.050
now Mexico City.

2229
01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:54.340
And I began to realize there was a fascinating story to tell here and a story

2230
01:05:54.341 --> 01:05:56.080
that had never been properly told.

2231
01:05:56.081 --> 01:05:58.570
And I used the accounts of some of the cookies to doors.

2232
01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.000
Men like Ben Ideas who give us,

2233
01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:02.320
who give us eye witness,

2234
01:06:02.321 --> 01:06:04.120
accounts of Aztec society.

2235
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.720
Uh,

2236
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:09.720
this helped me to under because the Aztecs were late comers in the civilization

2237
01:06:10.271 --> 01:06:11.104
of Mexico,

2238
01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:12.970
but they only existed as a,

2239
01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:13.390
as a,

2240
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:16.360
as an an empire for 200 years before Cortez came.

2241
01:06:17.170 --> 01:06:19.570
But they revered earlier cultures.

2242
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.590
Um,

2243
01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:21.060
and,

2244
01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.990
and the particularly the,

2245
01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:23.260
uh,

2246
01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:28.000
amazing pyramid site of Teotihuacan 30 miles north of Mexico City was the,

2247
01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:29.860
which means the place where men became gods.

2248
01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:33.250
So I was investigating the possibility of a lost civilization,

2249
01:06:33.251 --> 01:06:37.000
but I was kind of imbibing the story of Cortez and,

2250
01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:39.010
and of the Aztecs at the same time.

2251
01:06:39.011 --> 01:06:44.011
And I felt this kind of Paul of sadness that hangs over and Mexico,

2252
01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:47.620
this feeling that something terrible happened there.

2253
01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:51.010
And what's at the heart of my story without,

2254
01:06:51.011 --> 01:06:52.600
without giving too much of it away,

2255
01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:53.410
is this,

2256
01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:57.600
is this notion of demonic influence that Montezuma and I accepted.

2257
01:06:57.601 --> 01:07:00.640
It could be projection of the individual's mind because he's just a particularly

2258
01:07:00.641 --> 01:07:00.971
wicked,

2259
01:07:00.971 --> 01:07:01.721
evil individual.

2260
01:07:01.721 --> 01:07:03.850
Or it could be that there are real demons out there.

2261
01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:08.710
So Montezuma is communicated with and advised by Witsell or possibly the war God

2262
01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:10.530
and Cortez is well known,

2263
01:07:10.570 --> 01:07:13.210
had believed he had a special relationship with Saint Peter.

2264
01:07:13.790 --> 01:07:14.130
Uh,

2265
01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:14.710
and that,

2266
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:19.600
and he in dreams encountered Saint Peter and Saint Peter advised him to carry

2267
01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:23.710
out some of the most horrific acts of genocide that have been ever recorded in

2268
01:07:23.711 --> 01:07:24.730
the history of the Americas.

2269
01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:26.430
And so convenient.

2270
01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:26.970
There's,

2271
01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:27.220
yeah,

2272
01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:31.900
the speculation of the novel is that both the entity that appeared to Montezuma

2273
01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:37.020
as the war God and the entity that appeared to Cortez as Saint Peter,

2274
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:42.100
we're actually one and the same demonic entity seeking to multiply human misery.

2275
01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:43.510
Cause that's what demons do.

2276
01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:46.810
And if we think it was bad under the Aztecs,

2277
01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:51.400
let's be honest and accept that it was a thousand times worse after the Spanish

2278
01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:53.650
took over the population of Mexico.

2279
01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:56.440
It was calculated to be 30 million in 15,

2280
01:07:56.441 --> 01:07:57.274
19.

2281
01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.980
Within 40 years it was 1 million.

2282
01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.220
29 million people died,

2283
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:05.530
gigantic.

2284
01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:06.131
Wow.

2285
01:08:06.131 --> 01:08:10.420
Renders genocide and the Spanish were monsters.

2286
01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:11.150
This,

2287
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:15.070
they would use people to test the edge,

2288
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.741
their weapons.

2289
01:08:15.741 --> 01:08:19.970
Let's just see if we can chop off somebody's arm here.

2290
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:22.100
Let's see what this acts will do.

2291
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.611
Oh,

2292
01:08:22.611 --> 01:08:23.690
the dogs are hungry.

2293
01:08:23.691 --> 01:08:26.370
Let's just throw a bunch of people to the dogs.

2294
01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.850
That's where the phrase throwing them to the dogs comes from as a matter of

2295
01:08:28.851 --> 01:08:29.684
fact.

2296
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.830
So they weren't,

2297
01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:33.590
they were awful people and it's been a dark story to write.

2298
01:08:33.591 --> 01:08:34.060
But I've,

2299
01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:34.221
I,

2300
01:08:34.221 --> 01:08:34.551
I've,

2301
01:08:34.551 --> 01:08:36.020
I've also found that in this,

2302
01:08:36.021 --> 01:08:36.741
in this world,

2303
01:08:36.741 --> 01:08:37.311
in this realm,

2304
01:08:37.311 --> 01:08:38.390
at that time there was,

2305
01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:39.680
there was the capacity for love,

2306
01:08:39.681 --> 01:08:41.450
the word decent people who did their best.

2307
01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.420
<v 5>My Dad has a pretty sensible guy.</v>

2308
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:47.680
He's never for weirdness or spiritual shit.

2309
01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:49.330
He's just not that kind of guy.

2310
01:08:50.230 --> 01:08:53.440
But he was telling me about going to Gettysburg and he said that was a

2311
01:08:53.441 --> 01:08:54.770
horrendous battle.

2312
01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:57.820
And he said he could feel sadness in the air.

2313
01:08:57.821 --> 01:08:58.930
And he said it was in escapable.

2314
01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.100
It was almost overwhelming.

2315
01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:01.450
And he said,

2316
01:09:01.451 --> 01:09:02.620
I just didn't expect that.

2317
01:09:02.621 --> 01:09:02.980
He said,

2318
01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:03.251
you know,

2319
01:09:03.251 --> 01:09:03.820
I didn't,

2320
01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:04.091
I mean,

2321
01:09:04.091 --> 01:09:04.930
I don't know what it is.

2322
01:09:04.931 --> 01:09:05.530
I Dunno what it is.

2323
01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:07.660
Maybe it's the knowledge of what happened there.

2324
01:09:07.690 --> 01:09:07.931
He goes,

2325
01:09:07.931 --> 01:09:08.760
but I don't think so.

2326
01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.150
It's just like he goes,

2327
01:09:10.151 --> 01:09:10.571
it was like,

2328
01:09:10.571 --> 01:09:13.150
it was in the air penetrates the atmosphere.

2329
01:09:13.210 --> 01:09:18.040
And you felt that I felt that very strongly that there was this terrible sadness

2330
01:09:18.041 --> 01:09:18.810
hanging over myself.

2331
01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:19.643
I was always high.

2332
01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:22.390
It could have been that,

2333
01:09:22.391 --> 01:09:22.840
right?

2334
01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:23.201
Yeah.

2335
01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:24.430
Can we a high in Mexico?

2336
01:09:24.431 --> 01:09:25.480
You fucking gangster.

2337
01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:27.010
Damn.

2338
01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:27.843
That's dangerous.

2339
01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:28.490
Um,

2340
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:31.060
I wanted to ask you about this because there's a guy in my message board,

2341
01:09:31.061 --> 01:09:32.600
his name is Frodo Swagmans,

2342
01:09:32.610 --> 01:09:33.850
and he sent me a cool link,

2343
01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:34.620
um,

2344
01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:35.110
to,

2345
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.740
um,

2346
01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:40.740
this new thing that's been found under tio two a con they found a jade mask from

2347
01:09:42.881 --> 01:09:45.220
an earlier era and um,

2348
01:09:45.221 --> 01:09:45.610
some,

2349
01:09:45.610 --> 01:09:46.600
some building,

2350
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.411
some,

2351
01:09:47.411 --> 01:09:50.980
some work underneath there that they're investigating now that they believe was

2352
01:09:50.981 --> 01:09:51.630
all men.

2353
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:52.050
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2354
01:09:52.050 --> 01:09:52.380
Yeah.

2355
01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:53.490
It doesn't surprise me at all,

2356
01:09:53.491 --> 01:09:54.090
I think.

2357
01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:57.840
I think we're gonna find the [inaudible] what con actually goes way back,

2358
01:09:57.870 --> 01:10:00.480
not just to the beginnings of the historical epoch,

2359
01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:05.100
but far deep into prehistory and all make these so called all Max of Central

2360
01:10:05.101 --> 01:10:06.870
America may go back 10,

2361
01:10:06.871 --> 01:10:07.890
12,000 years.

2362
01:10:07.891 --> 01:10:08.700
They may not be,

2363
01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:11.340
I don't think we should just limit them to the last three and a half thousand

2364
01:10:11.341 --> 01:10:11.641
years.

2365
01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:14.520
So this is the case with many of these sites.

2366
01:10:14.521 --> 01:10:14.971
It's the same,

2367
01:10:14.971 --> 01:10:15.271
by the way,

2368
01:10:15.271 --> 01:10:15.871
if you've got a church,

2369
01:10:15.871 --> 01:10:16.650
Anita,

2370
01:10:16.650 --> 01:10:19.080
if you can get inside the pyramid of cook,

2371
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:19.963
can a chicken,

2372
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:20.280
chicken,

2373
01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:20.540
Nissan,

2374
01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:23.820
Cook County is just another name for quite so quietal you'll find that it's

2375
01:10:23.821 --> 01:10:25.500
built on top of another pyramid,

2376
01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:30.550
which is inside it and older pyramid and preserved completely inside a new can

2377
01:10:30.551 --> 01:10:32.700
even get inside that that older pyramid,

2378
01:10:32.701 --> 01:10:34.230
and I think it's the case all over the world,

2379
01:10:34.231 --> 01:10:38.250
that sites have been built on top of all sites reincarnated in a way.

2380
01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:42.840
So there was an ancient sacred place and later cultures came along and honored

2381
01:10:42.841 --> 01:10:45.060
it and built new monuments on top of it.

2382
01:10:45.061 --> 01:10:45.300
But,

2383
01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:45.770
but the,

2384
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:48.720
the mistake they are killed just make is that the origins of the site of the

2385
01:10:48.721 --> 01:10:51.570
later culture and they don't take account of the earlier culture.

2386
01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:51.831
<v 5>Well,</v>

2387
01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:55.340
that was one of the things that John Anthony West was suggesting about Egypt.

2388
01:10:55.341 --> 01:10:59.210
When we show that very different construction methods that coincidentally are

2389
01:10:59.211 --> 01:11:01.010
below the ground,

2390
01:11:01.050 --> 01:11:03.830
like you have to dig out the sand to pull these things up and oh,

2391
01:11:03.831 --> 01:11:04.670
Lo and behold,

2392
01:11:04.671 --> 01:11:05.451
they looked different.

2393
01:11:05.451 --> 01:11:05.680
Yeah.

2394
01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:06.850
And that's like the Syria

2395
01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:08.090
<v 3>at um,</v>

2396
01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:08.470
uh,

2397
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:10.140
in Abby dose in Upper Egypt,

2398
01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:12.870
which is 50 or 60 feet lower than the temple of,

2399
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:13.651
to first,

2400
01:11:13.651 --> 01:11:14.250
and was actually

2401
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:18.030
<v 4>covered with 50 feet of sedimentation until archeologists dug out.</v>

2402
01:11:18.031 --> 01:11:20.370
But they still insist on giving it to seti the first.

2403
01:11:20.371 --> 01:11:20.670
Yes.

2404
01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:21.503
<v 1>No,</v>

2405
01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:23.380
it's a fascinating thing.

2406
01:11:23.381 --> 01:11:26.350
The denialism that's involved in Egypt,

2407
01:11:26.351 --> 01:11:26.730
Thailand.

2408
01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:27.940
It is Zoe.

2409
01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:31.000
Hawaiians dude is a trip just to watch him talk about them.

2410
01:11:31.001 --> 01:11:36.001
So like how were you in control of how this thing gets labeled or discovered or

2411
01:11:36.251 --> 01:11:39.820
researched and extraordinary things are his rise to power.

2412
01:11:39.821 --> 01:11:41.530
And then his subsequent fall,

2413
01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:42.521
is he in trouble now?

2414
01:11:42.521 --> 01:11:44.230
He's in deep shit.

2415
01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:45.203
Is he going to jail?

2416
01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.233
Yeah.

2417
01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:47.163
Corruption.

2418
01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:48.010
<v 4>Um,</v>

2419
01:11:48.010 --> 01:11:48.580
so,

2420
01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:48.821
well,

2421
01:11:48.821 --> 01:11:49.031
no,

2422
01:11:49.031 --> 01:11:49.600
he's made,

2423
01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:53.950
his main thing was that he was closely associated with the Mubarak family,

2424
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:56.710
particularly with Susan Mubarak.

2425
01:11:56.711 --> 01:12:01.210
The wife of the deposed President Hosni Mubarak and they protected him so he

2426
01:12:01.211 --> 01:12:05.470
could do whatever he liked while Mubarak was running Egypt and therefore he was

2427
01:12:05.471 --> 01:12:09.220
one of the closest to Mubarak in the Egyptian regime.

2428
01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:13.330
So when Mubarak fell and a whole new system came into play in Egypt,

2429
01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:13.700
does that,

2430
01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:14.770
he was one of the first to go.

2431
01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:15.970
<v 1>Uh,</v>

2432
01:12:15.970 --> 01:12:17.730
it was a shocking the,

2433
01:12:17.731 --> 01:12:17.930
the,

2434
01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:18.321
the,

2435
01:12:18.321 --> 01:12:21.320
the John Anthony West series magical Egypt is one of my favorites.

2436
01:12:21.321 --> 01:12:22.071
DVD series.

2437
01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:26.930
John is such a brilliant human being and he's devoted his life to exploring the

2438
01:12:26.931 --> 01:12:28.820
mystery of Egypt and the magic of Egypt.

2439
01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:29.270
This is,

2440
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:31.010
this is what archeologist never do.

2441
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.851
And if he's listening,

2442
01:12:31.851 --> 01:12:32.661
I owe you an email,

2443
01:12:32.661 --> 01:12:32.960
dude.

2444
01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:33.711
I swear to God,

2445
01:12:33.711 --> 01:12:34.670
I'm gonna email you back quick.

2446
01:12:34.671 --> 01:12:38.420
I'm just been crazy busy cause even like stairs with John Today,

2447
01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:42.640
I've been so swamped with this new TV show that I'm doing that I,

2448
01:12:42.641 --> 01:12:42.921
I'm,

2449
01:12:42.921 --> 01:12:44.000
I'm behind on everything.

2450
01:12:44.001 --> 01:12:46.220
Text messages and emails and all that.

2451
01:12:46.221 --> 01:12:49.450
But I'm a big fan of that guy's work and that magical Egypt things.

2452
01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:52.330
Just one of the most stunning documentary series I've ever watched.

2453
01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:52.920
It's it,

2454
01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.770
it's like 10 DVDs or something like that.

2455
01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:56.093
It's amount of work.

2456
01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:57.620
Corporate incorporating.

2457
01:12:57.621 --> 01:12:57.730
Yeah.

2458
01:12:57.730 --> 01:13:01.870
<v 4>John's just vast encyclopedic knowledge of the mysteries of Egypt.</v>

2459
01:13:01.871 --> 01:13:02.381
It's all,

2460
01:13:02.381 --> 01:13:02.771
it's all,

2461
01:13:02.771 --> 01:13:04.120
it's all expressed in there.

2462
01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:04.930
Incredible.

2463
01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:06.640
So John is about to be vindicated,

2464
01:13:06.641 --> 01:13:07.480
I would say.

2465
01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.510
Um,

2466
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:12.100
he and Robert Schoch from Boston University,

2467
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.620
we did,

2468
01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:15.370
this was John's work initially and Robert Schoch became involved in it,

2469
01:13:15.371 --> 01:13:16.204
which was the,

2470
01:13:16.210 --> 01:13:19.600
you'll remember the argument about the Sphinx and the Sphinx.

2471
01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:24.930
There's very characteristic erosion marks both on its body and on the trench dug

2472
01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:26.434
around it.

2473
01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:30.010
And that those are the marks of precipitation induced weathering of exposure to

2474
01:13:30.011 --> 01:13:31.510
thousands of years of heavy rainfall.

2475
01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:32.740
Cut a long story short,

2476
01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:35.530
no such rain fall in Egypt in the last 5,000 years.

2477
01:13:35.531 --> 01:13:36.400
You have to go back 10,

2478
01:13:36.401 --> 01:13:37.570
12,000 years,

2479
01:13:37.571 --> 01:13:40.270
the end of the last ice age to get that kind of climate.

2480
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:44.470
<v 1>And then you have to have thousands of years of those conditions to create that</v>

2481
01:13:44.471 --> 01:13:45.010
together.

2482
01:13:45.010 --> 01:13:45.560
<v 4>Get that,</v>

2483
01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:46.393
to get that weathering.

2484
01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:51.580
So when John and John Anthony West and Robert Schoch and dropped this bombshell

2485
01:13:51.651 --> 01:13:56.651
on Egyptology in roughly 1992 that the Sphinx actually might be thousands of

2486
01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:00.740
years older than the Egypt Egyptologists imagine there was a huge outcry and

2487
01:14:00.741 --> 01:14:01.970
egyptologist became very,

2488
01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:05.450
very angry about it because they were threatened and the in the core of their

2489
01:14:05.451 --> 01:14:06.284
being.

2490
01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:07.940
And one of the arguments they made,

2491
01:14:07.941 --> 01:14:10.250
which they thought was the killer argument was,

2492
01:14:10.251 --> 01:14:10.850
look,

2493
01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:13.340
you're this monument is 12,000 years old,

2494
01:14:13.670 --> 01:14:16.520
but there are no other large monuments anywhere in the world,

2495
01:14:16.521 --> 01:14:17.930
which are 12,000 years old.

2496
01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:20.360
Unfortunately for the Egyptologists,

2497
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:23.140
that's no longer true because there's the,

2498
01:14:23.150 --> 01:14:27.160
just the most amazing site has been discovered in Turkey called go back Beckley

2499
01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:27.390
Cathy.

2500
01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:27.590
Yeah,

2501
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:30.470
we talked about the last time you had amazing and,

2502
01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:34.910
and it was deliberately buried by the people who've made it 14,000 years.

2503
01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:35.061
Well,

2504
01:14:35.061 --> 01:14:35.201
no,

2505
01:14:35.201 --> 01:14:35.361
they,

2506
01:14:35.361 --> 01:14:35.640
they,

2507
01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.610
it looks like it was made 12,000 years,

2508
01:14:37.611 --> 01:14:39.710
12 to deliberately buried 10,000 years ago.

2509
01:14:39.710 --> 01:14:44.510
And that means that no later culture has trumped over it to confuse the dating

2510
01:14:44.511 --> 01:14:45.344
record.

2511
01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.660
And therefore we have a pristine site.

2512
01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:52.550
And when a site is pristine and it's approached by a mainstream archaeologists

2513
01:14:52.551 --> 01:14:55.220
such as clash spirit from the German archeological institute who's the

2514
01:14:55.221 --> 01:14:55.910
excavator,

2515
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:57.950
he has to honestly put his hand on his heart and say,

2516
01:14:58.100 --> 01:14:59.630
this side is 12,000 years old.

2517
01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:01.850
And if got Beckley Tempe as 12,000 years old,

2518
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:04.850
then there's no reason on earth why this thinks shouldn't be 12,000 years old.

2519
01:15:04.851 --> 01:15:07.490
And if the Sphinx and go back to the Tempe at 12,000 years old,

2520
01:15:07.491 --> 01:15:09.530
and I'm sorry we have to rewrite the history book.

2521
01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:11.740
<v 5>There was a real weird moment,</v>

2522
01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:12.220
um,

2523
01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:17.220
on whatever documentary it was that showed a Robert Schoch presenting his

2524
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:21.640
findings because he's an academic and he's the only one that they would allow to

2525
01:15:21.641 --> 01:15:22.061
present.

2526
01:15:22.061 --> 01:15:23.620
And that sort of geology at Boston University.

2527
01:15:23.621 --> 01:15:27.610
And John Anthony West is not an academic and he's an Egypt expert.

2528
01:15:27.611 --> 01:15:29.890
He's a guy who's immersed himself in Egypt his whole life.

2529
01:15:29.891 --> 01:15:32.140
But I don't know what his formal education is,

2530
01:15:32.141 --> 01:15:34.240
but the fact that that guy hasn't given,

2531
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:35.830
been given some sort of uh,

2532
01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:40.090
at least like someone test him and give the guy a fucking degree because like

2533
01:15:40.091 --> 01:15:45.091
who the hell knows more about ancient Egypt and John Anthony West and it should

2534
01:15:45.371 --> 01:15:48.600
obviously his credentials should be examined and I'm in his,

2535
01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:49.150
his,

2536
01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:53.380
his word should be checked but I'm sure that he's on,

2537
01:15:53.630 --> 01:15:54.720
I mean he's on,

2538
01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:59.470
I've never heard a single thing about any of his translations about any of his

2539
01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:01.990
disc that it seemed to me anything less than country,

2540
01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:02.860
if there were negative,

2541
01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:04.330
like it didn't make any sense at all.

2542
01:16:04.331 --> 01:16:07.350
Like I think he's a pretty astounding person when it comes to knowledge

2543
01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.150
<v 4>person and I beat the case.</v>

2544
01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.500
I think that he's brought a unique insight to ancient Egypt and he's done far

2545
01:16:13.501 --> 01:16:17.560
more for the exploration of the past than any credentialed Egyptologists.

2546
01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.060
Yeah.

2547
01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:18.860
<v 5>So now that go,</v>

2548
01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:22.410
Beckley tap has been clearly established at least 10,000 years old.

2549
01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:26.610
That's when it was cause the best stuff is the oldest 10,000 years,

2550
01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:27.631
10,000 years ago,

2551
01:16:27.631 --> 01:16:28.680
like a time capsule.

2552
01:16:28.681 --> 01:16:29.820
They bury it and by the way,

2553
01:16:29.821 --> 01:16:32.250
it's only 5% of it has been excavated.

2554
01:16:32.251 --> 01:16:36.680
A huge vast area be who knows what the hell they're going to find under there,

2555
01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:38.580
whether they're going to find artifacts or what have you.

2556
01:16:38.581 --> 01:16:43.581
That that explain things a little bit better but we know people were capable of

2557
01:16:43.951 --> 01:16:44.550
doing that thing.

2558
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:45.870
Now that's 100%

2559
01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:49.010
<v 4>and therefore if they're capable cause some of those megaliths way up,</v>

2560
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:50.420
one of them weighs 50 tons.

2561
01:16:50.421 --> 01:16:51.140
You know,

2562
01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.880
go back to the Tempe is a stone circle.

2563
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.800
There's a circle of a series of stories of stone circles and therefore we're

2564
01:16:57.801 --> 01:17:01.670
looking at a culture that 12,000 years ago was already capable of doing that.

2565
01:17:01.671 --> 01:17:02.504
In other words,

2566
01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:05.120
we can't say that they just made that up overnight.

2567
01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:05.330
Right.

2568
01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:07.190
There has to be a long background to that.

2569
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:11.790
That got them to the point where they could do that and that that is why go back

2570
01:17:11.791 --> 01:17:15.970
to Tapi is the single most important archeological site in the world because it

2571
01:17:15.971 --> 01:17:18.190
could not have appeared by magic.

2572
01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:22.270
It had to be the result of a culture which had figured out how to work with

2573
01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:26.390
large and heavy blocks of stone and to add to query them and carve them and move

2574
01:17:26.391 --> 01:17:28.660
them around and that we're not our ancestors.

2575
01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:30.770
I supposed to have been a hunter gatherers,

2576
01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:31.450
you know,

2577
01:17:31.450 --> 01:17:32.860
living in small groups,

2578
01:17:33.130 --> 01:17:33.860
um,

2579
01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:36.390
without any large scale organization and go back to the top.

2580
01:17:36.391 --> 01:17:37.450
It gives the light of that

2581
01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:41.570
<v 5>and there's a very sophisticated carving method employed on these,</v>

2582
01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:42.360
these beams,

2583
01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:46.730
a three dimensional carving method where instead of carving the image into the

2584
01:17:46.731 --> 01:17:47.481
stone itself,

2585
01:17:47.481 --> 01:17:49.040
which is the easy way to draw something,

2586
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:51.890
they actually left the piece of stone.

2587
01:17:51.891 --> 01:17:52.070
Yeah.

2588
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:53.360
Like if they drew a lizard,

2589
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:57.140
it would cut away everything else and leave the lizard to stand out.

2590
01:17:57.141 --> 01:17:57.680
Exactly.

2591
01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:58.880
That's very difficult.

2592
01:17:59.330 --> 01:17:59.930
<v 4>High relief.</v>

2593
01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:00.650
It's extremely,

2594
01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:01.880
it's extremely difficult to do.

2595
01:18:01.881 --> 01:18:02.690
And again,

2596
01:18:02.690 --> 01:18:03.710
it takes practice.

2597
01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.420
It takes a culture that's worked on that.

2598
01:18:05.421 --> 01:18:07.100
So we have to say there's a background to this,

2599
01:18:07.101 --> 01:18:10.790
which goes thousands of years earlier than the site that we found and as more

2600
01:18:10.791 --> 01:18:11.870
excavation is done,

2601
01:18:11.871 --> 01:18:13.550
I believe more and more of that is,

2602
01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:14.960
is going to come out.

2603
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.600
So

2604
01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:20.070
<v 5>one of my favorite quotes of yours is that we're a civilization with Amnesia</v>

2605
01:18:20.190 --> 01:18:22.210
spaces with amnesiac needs.

2606
01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:22.670
Yeah.

2607
01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:23.050
It's,

2608
01:18:23.050 --> 01:18:27.150
it's such a great way of putting it because when you keep digging holes and

2609
01:18:27.151 --> 01:18:29.310
finding things that are like old as fuck,

2610
01:18:29.490 --> 01:18:31.500
like go back to the temp was found by a farmer,

2611
01:18:31.501 --> 01:18:31.771
right.

2612
01:18:31.771 --> 01:18:33.570
And it was just putzing around and was like,

2613
01:18:33.571 --> 01:18:34.321
what the hell is this?

2614
01:18:34.321 --> 01:18:34.921
He kicks it,

2615
01:18:34.921 --> 01:18:35.640
he moves it around.

2616
01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.600
It's like this is weird.

2617
01:18:36.730 --> 01:18:38.370
He starts digging and boom.

2618
01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.860
It's one of the most important archeological findings ever.

2619
01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:41.460
Absolutely.

2620
01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:44.690
But none of this existed while you guys were dealing with Zalia hos no,

2621
01:18:45.090 --> 01:18:45.450
no.

2622
01:18:45.450 --> 01:18:46.740
I was watching that.

2623
01:18:46.741 --> 01:18:51.030
And the other thing was the other academic who he was communicating with,

2624
01:18:51.031 --> 01:18:51.990
whatever that guy's name is,

2625
01:18:51.991 --> 01:18:54.070
no need to even say it in such a country.

2626
01:18:54.071 --> 01:18:55.290
You human being

2627
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:57.200
<v 1>the way he was laughing,</v>

2628
01:18:57.201 --> 01:18:59.000
like what culture are we talking about?

2629
01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:00.680
But he existed 10,000 years.

2630
01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:02.370
That just,

2631
01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:02.651
why,

2632
01:19:02.651 --> 01:19:03.740
why is that funny to you?

2633
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:04.880
That's him remain nameless.

2634
01:19:04.881 --> 01:19:07.220
I know who you remember the name was and um,

2635
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:07.521
yeah,

2636
01:19:07.521 --> 01:19:08.960
they pour scorn on these,

2637
01:19:08.961 --> 01:19:09.794
on these ideas.

2638
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:10.800
Intellectual score.

2639
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:11.030
No,

2640
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:12.110
fucking arrogant.

2641
01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:12.860
You know,

2642
01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:13.693
not all of them.

2643
01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:14.190
No,

2644
01:19:14.190 --> 01:19:14.821
not all of them,

2645
01:19:14.821 --> 01:19:16.640
but I mean most of them are doing amazing things.

2646
01:19:16.641 --> 01:19:17.990
The reason why you have an incredible hip,

2647
01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:21.080
I cry some bad mother fuckers in academia.

2648
01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:22.861
Absolutely.

2649
01:19:22.861 --> 01:19:23.260
Yeah.

2650
01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:23.900
I'm not,

2651
01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:27.320
I'm not insulting science as such as humans.

2652
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:29.420
Just shitty ego is just some Shitty,

2653
01:19:29.421 --> 01:19:30.171
ego-driven human.

2654
01:19:30.171 --> 01:19:30.260
Yeah.

2655
01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:30.390
<v 4>Is,</v>

2656
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:35.390
and it happens that archaeology is one of those areas of study which is very

2657
01:19:35.761 --> 01:19:37.350
territorial and where,

2658
01:19:37.710 --> 01:19:42.710
where scholars have staked their reputation on a particular view of the past and

2659
01:19:42.751 --> 01:19:46.650
they get very angry when anybody threatened threatens that.

2660
01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:47.401
And they're very,

2661
01:19:47.401 --> 01:19:47.881
very,

2662
01:19:47.881 --> 01:19:50.900
very obnoxious to one another as well as to outside.

2663
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:55.940
<v 5>And they've told this story and given degrees based on what they've taught for</v>

2664
01:19:55.941 --> 01:19:56.601
decades.

2665
01:19:56.601 --> 01:19:57.200
Yes.

2666
01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.011
Decades after,

2667
01:19:58.011 --> 01:19:58.970
decades after decades.

2668
01:19:58.971 --> 01:20:00.440
And to all of a sudden step in and say,

2669
01:20:00.710 --> 01:20:01.543
we were wrong.

2670
01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:02.300
Yeah,

2671
01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:04.730
there's no way this guy,

2672
01:20:04.930 --> 01:20:05.380
you know,

2673
01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:06.430
<v 4>it's very difficult to do.</v>

2674
01:20:06.490 --> 01:20:06.830
It's very,

2675
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:07.740
very to do.

2676
01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:08.410
And,

2677
01:20:08.410 --> 01:20:11.310
and in saying these negative things about Egyptology,

2678
01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:15.000
I also do want to say that they also do great work.

2679
01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.700
There's a fantastic work has been done by Egyptology.

2680
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:18.480
Um,

2681
01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:18.721
and,

2682
01:20:18.721 --> 01:20:21.840
and I don't think that I could have written any of my books if I hadn't been

2683
01:20:21.841 --> 01:20:23.130
able to draw on the,

2684
01:20:23.131 --> 01:20:24.930
on the huge amount of data that,

2685
01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.520
that Egyptology has provided.

2686
01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:30.090
But sometimes I put a different interpretation on it from the one that they put

2687
01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:30.331
on it.

2688
01:20:30.331 --> 01:20:31.920
So I don't want to put them down completely.

2689
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:32.700
They've done,

2690
01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:33.810
they've done great work,

2691
01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:37.380
but they're narrowly focused on a particular reference frame,

2692
01:20:37.381 --> 01:20:40.140
a particular idea of how human history evolved.

2693
01:20:40.141 --> 01:20:44.040
And they should let the evidence speak for itself rather than impose that.

2694
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.140
And we should point out that on it.

2695
01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:48.930
<v 5>We should point out that there is a small group of people,</v>

2696
01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:49.470
um,

2697
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:49.920
that,

2698
01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:50.190
uh,

2699
01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:50.971
not a small group.

2700
01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:52.590
I shouldn't even say I shouldn't quantify them.

2701
01:20:53.010 --> 01:20:53.400
Um,

2702
01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:57.180
there's some people believe that the water erosion,

2703
01:20:57.260 --> 01:20:57.990
the feature,

2704
01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:59.520
it was actually wind and sand.

2705
01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:00.211
Um,

2706
01:21:00.211 --> 01:21:00.411
I've,

2707
01:21:00.411 --> 01:21:02.460
I've seen that argument and um,

2708
01:21:02.461 --> 01:21:04.110
I'm not a geologist obviously,

2709
01:21:04.111 --> 01:21:07.230
but when I saw Robert Schoch deal with that argument,

2710
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:08.423
it doesn't seem to hold,

2711
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:10.170
<v 4>shucks.</v>

2712
01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:13.410
Got An excellent answer tool to all of that and add it is not,

2713
01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:16.290
it is not we'd weathering so it was not sand.

2714
01:21:16.291 --> 01:21:16.591
Anyway,

2715
01:21:16.591 --> 01:21:18.510
the Sphinx was covered with sand for a very long

2716
01:21:19.010 --> 01:21:24.010
<v 5>comes like cuts down and in it looks like water had been pouring down for a long</v>

2717
01:21:24.041 --> 01:21:24.874
time.

2718
01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:27.730
Cutting grooves into the Roth in groovy.

2719
01:21:27.731 --> 01:21:28.061
Like,

2720
01:21:28.061 --> 01:21:28.301
you know,

2721
01:21:28.301 --> 01:21:29.134
I mean,

2722
01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:30.461
I don't know though.

2723
01:21:30.461 --> 01:21:30.910
I'm not,

2724
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:32.110
I'm not qualified to,

2725
01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:32.860
that's why.

2726
01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:33.521
<v 4>Why shock,</v>

2727
01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:34.090
you know,

2728
01:21:34.090 --> 01:21:37.630
it has made a marvelous contribution to this whole field because he is a credit

2729
01:21:37.631 --> 01:21:38.464
shield academic.

2730
01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:42.280
He is a geologist and he's been prepared to put his reputation on the line and

2731
01:21:42.281 --> 01:21:42.551
say,

2732
01:21:42.551 --> 01:21:43.001
I'm sorry.

2733
01:21:43.001 --> 01:21:43.990
I think the sinks is really,

2734
01:21:43.991 --> 01:21:44.730
really helpful.

2735
01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:45.061
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2736
01:21:45.061 --> 01:21:49.920
What bothers me about the people that debunk it is they claim to be correct.

2737
01:21:50.190 --> 01:21:51.050
The people that look at it,

2738
01:21:51.051 --> 01:21:54.210
it's very obvious you're dealing with some pretty significant erosion.

2739
01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:58.920
So why is it so different looking than the erosion on the outside of the Sphinx,

2740
01:21:58.921 --> 01:22:00.450
which looks like when sand.

2741
01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:00.840
Yeah.

2742
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.320
Why are you dealing with it in this enclosure where this thing was buried for so

2743
01:22:04.321 --> 01:22:04.651
long?

2744
01:22:04.651 --> 01:22:05.251
Like why?

2745
01:22:05.251 --> 01:22:06.360
Why is it different here?

2746
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:08.400
Is it the type of stone?

2747
01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:09.480
Is that what it is?

2748
01:22:09.481 --> 01:22:09.751
I mean,

2749
01:22:09.751 --> 01:22:12.690
what is it or is it evidence of an older time?

2750
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:17.670
Is it possibly something that was built into some malleable stone a long fucking

2751
01:22:17.671 --> 01:22:20.070
time ago and then pretending that it's not possible?

2752
01:22:20.071 --> 01:22:20.910
It's kind of silly.

2753
01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:22.680
It's kind of silly because you don't know.

2754
01:22:22.681 --> 01:22:26.460
We don't have it really accurate map of what happened 10,000 years ago.

2755
01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:28.410
How do you know that the history of science as such,

2756
01:22:28.411 --> 01:22:29.790
we know again and again

2757
01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:34.450
<v 4>that fixed and rigid views about how the world is do get overthrown.</v>

2758
01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.650
It didn't get changed,

2759
01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:38.590
but reluctantly in summary with a fight,

2760
01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:42.760
but eventually the new evidence overwhelms the old and I think we're in the

2761
01:22:42.761 --> 01:22:43.840
realm of ancient history.

2762
01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:47.590
We are poised on the verge of that kind of revolution.

2763
01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:48.480
I think it's got to happen

2764
01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:50.280
<v 5>with Zoe Huw os out of the picture.</v>

2765
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:54.420
Is it possible now that can excavate some sites that they weren't allowed to

2766
01:22:54.421 --> 01:22:54.871
before?

2767
01:22:54.871 --> 01:22:57.720
Like I know there was something where they wanted to do something under the paw

2768
01:22:57.721 --> 01:22:58.291
of the Sphinx.

2769
01:22:58.291 --> 01:22:59.490
They had found some chamber

2770
01:22:59.810 --> 01:23:00.643
<v 4>that's a needed,</v>

2771
01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.930
that's a needed project,

2772
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.370
which needed,

2773
01:23:03.370 --> 01:23:04.040
which needs to be done.

2774
01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:04.850
I don't know.

2775
01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:06.320
I know whether the new authorities

2776
01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:09.910
<v 3>to right now Egypt is just so busy surviving and so busy,</v>

2777
01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:12.700
so busy trying to figure out where it goes next.

2778
01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:13.770
And um,

2779
01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:14.111
you know,

2780
01:23:14.111 --> 01:23:16.750
they've had a major political change.

2781
01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:17.590
Um,

2782
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:20.800
but many of the old guard are still in place in many,

2783
01:23:20.801 --> 01:23:21.640
many ways.

2784
01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:22.520
And a,

2785
01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:25.210
there is this popular uprising in Egypt,

2786
01:23:25.211 --> 01:23:27.020
but it's disorganized and unplanned it.

2787
01:23:27.021 --> 01:23:30.850
So right now the last thing that most Egyptians are thinking about is,

2788
01:23:30.851 --> 01:23:31.270
um,

2789
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:36.270
is ancient history take on that part of the world as a comedian is that if

2790
01:23:37.031 --> 01:23:38.770
that's the birthplace of civilization,

2791
01:23:38.771 --> 01:23:41.050
that's the cradle of civilization that those people right now,

2792
01:23:41.051 --> 01:23:42.700
that's the townies of the world.

2793
01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:43.210
Yeah.

2794
01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:47.350
That's the people that never left the people that literally are living like with

2795
01:23:47.351 --> 01:23:47.500
the,

2796
01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:51.670
the echoes of the behavior of people that live 10,000 years ago on that very

2797
01:23:51.671 --> 01:23:52.250
same spot.

2798
01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:52.980
Yeah.

2799
01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:55.510
That's why in particular,

2800
01:23:55.511 --> 01:23:59.950
Egypt's Coptic population who'd number out of 60 million,

2801
01:23:59.951 --> 01:24:00.311
I believe,

2802
01:24:00.311 --> 01:24:02.530
roughly 6 million our cops.

2803
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:03.760
So they are,

2804
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:06.790
they are practicing a particularly ancient form of Christianity.

2805
01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:12.060
They're language is structurally very closely related to the ancient Egyptian

2806
01:24:12.401 --> 01:24:16.510
language and they are the direct inheritors of the ancient Egyptian tradition.

2807
01:24:16.511 --> 01:24:21.511
So when ancient Egyptians were converted to Christianity roundabout three or 400

2808
01:24:22.481 --> 01:24:23.590
years after Christ,

2809
01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:24.430
um,

2810
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:26.860
that was the beginning of the Coptic church in,

2811
01:24:26.861 --> 01:24:27.611
in ancient Egypt.

2812
01:24:27.611 --> 01:24:32.611
And the Coptic people are the true inheritors of the lost wisdom.

2813
01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:35.100
Fascinating and ancient Dj.

2814
01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:36.700
And I bet they suck to hang out with,

2815
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:38.630
but they're really annoying.

2816
01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:40.180
But they've got some crazy rules.

2817
01:24:40.181 --> 01:24:42.100
They do a lot of weird stuff to their people.

2818
01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:42.690
Well,

2819
01:24:42.690 --> 01:24:43.070
they could,

2820
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.391
they do.

2821
01:24:43.391 --> 01:24:45.640
They are they involved in general population now?

2822
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:46.050
Really?

2823
01:24:46.050 --> 01:24:47.030
There's two ways to get there.

2824
01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.280
A persecuted minority.

2825
01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:49.173
Yeah.

2826
01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:49.421
Very,

2827
01:24:49.421 --> 01:24:49.781
very much.

2828
01:24:49.781 --> 01:24:50.770
6 million of them.

2829
01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:53.770
But out of 60 million and in an area which is,

2830
01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:54.613
um,

2831
01:24:54.730 --> 01:24:58.120
which is involved with Islamic fundamentalism are very much,

2832
01:24:58.121 --> 01:25:00.290
it's difficult to be a minority in that situation.

2833
01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:00.911
So what you're saying,

2834
01:25:00.911 --> 01:25:01.331
it's better.

2835
01:25:01.331 --> 01:25:02.860
It's better to be a Christian in that area.

2836
01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:03.970
No,

2837
01:25:03.970 --> 01:25:04.351
I,

2838
01:25:04.351 --> 01:25:08.080
I think that all three of the world's monotheistic faiths,

2839
01:25:08.081 --> 01:25:09.360
whether it's Christianity,

2840
01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:10.653
Judaism,

2841
01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:15.690
or Islam have been responsible for just a vast amount of misery in the world.

2842
01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:18.460
And I think if we're not going to move on as a human race,

2843
01:25:18.461 --> 01:25:21.790
unless we actually move on from that time where we don't,

2844
01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:26.410
we don't accept that something is true just because our parents or some guy with

2845
01:25:26.411 --> 01:25:28.000
a beard tells us that it's true.

2846
01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:28.660
You know,

2847
01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:31.930
we look for direct experience of the spirit and the divine.

2848
01:25:31.931 --> 01:25:33.730
This is the problem with all of those big religions.

2849
01:25:33.731 --> 01:25:35.470
I don't care whether they call themselves Christians,

2850
01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:37.000
Muslims or Jews,

2851
01:25:37.001 --> 01:25:37.361
you know,

2852
01:25:37.361 --> 01:25:38.710
is that there are hierarchies,

2853
01:25:38.711 --> 01:25:42.370
their bureaucracies that power structures and uh,

2854
01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:44.800
they do not offer a direct experience of that.

2855
01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.320
That's why all of them persecute the use of psychedelics.

2856
01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:51.460
They don't want people to have direct contact with the divine or you,

2857
01:25:51.461 --> 01:25:54.580
I'm hopeful about things when you see like Arab spring,

2858
01:25:54.610 --> 01:25:58.300
people were rising up and trying to remove dictators and what happened in Egypt,

2859
01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:59.440
getting rid of Mubarak.

2860
01:25:59.441 --> 01:26:01.210
And I am hopeful and I think it's,

2861
01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:04.850
I think it is happening all over the world and I think the Internet has played a

2862
01:26:04.851 --> 01:26:07.160
part with it and it's happening in America.

2863
01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:08.300
Um,

2864
01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:08.660
you know,

2865
01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:08.890
I,

2866
01:26:08.890 --> 01:26:10.370
I come here as a,

2867
01:26:10.371 --> 01:26:11.061
as a foreigner,

2868
01:26:11.061 --> 01:26:11.661
I'm British.

2869
01:26:11.661 --> 01:26:12.261
I come to,

2870
01:26:12.261 --> 01:26:13.160
I come to America.

2871
01:26:13.190 --> 01:26:14.023
Awesome.

2872
01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:14.990
Um,

2873
01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:16.730
I have family here in America.

2874
01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:19.790
I feel very closely connected with America.

2875
01:26:19.791 --> 01:26:21.290
And America is a paradox.

2876
01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:21.861
You know,

2877
01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:24.350
it's a huge paradox because on the world's stage,

2878
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:25.101
uh,

2879
01:26:25.101 --> 01:26:28.340
America is a very dark and malignant force,

2880
01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:29.241
which,

2881
01:26:29.241 --> 01:26:29.510
uh,

2882
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:31.400
which does tremendous harm,

2883
01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:32.600
uh,

2884
01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:35.180
consistently and has done for it for a long time.

2885
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:37.010
But at the individual level,

2886
01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:40.430
there's a tremendous spirit of awakening in America.

2887
01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:40.971
Look,

2888
01:26:40.971 --> 01:26:44.240
just what's happening with cannabis laws in America in the last,

2889
01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:45.410
in the last 10 years,

2890
01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.720
that's unimaginable in Britain.

2891
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:52.160
We can't make changes like that because we don't have this spirit of

2892
01:26:52.161 --> 01:26:52.701
independence.

2893
01:26:52.701 --> 01:26:57.290
We don't have the structure where individual states can make decisions on key

2894
01:26:57.291 --> 01:26:58.160
issues like that.

2895
01:26:58.570 --> 01:26:58.820
And,

2896
01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:02.090
and of course in America that there's a conflict between state law and federal

2897
01:27:02.091 --> 01:27:02.810
law.

2898
01:27:02.810 --> 01:27:03.081
You know,

2899
01:27:03.081 --> 01:27:06.920
the federal government is not always respecting state laws and is seeking to

2900
01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:07.970
persecute people who are,

2901
01:27:07.971 --> 01:27:08.810
who are using cannabis.

2902
01:27:08.811 --> 01:27:09.700
But you know,

2903
01:27:09.710 --> 01:27:11.120
I think that that in itself,

2904
01:27:11.121 --> 01:27:15.200
the fact that a number of states have decriminalized or even legalized cannabis,

2905
01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:15.920
uh,

2906
01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:17.250
is a sign of a,

2907
01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:22.400
a sea change that is underway at the moment and what it reflects is an awakening

2908
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:23.870
of the American people.

2909
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:24.980
So even though,

2910
01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:26.481
you know,

2911
01:27:26.481 --> 01:27:31.481
huge negative forces are still at work and I was still sitting in the seat of

2912
01:27:31.581 --> 01:27:32.240
power,

2913
01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:32.751
I think,

2914
01:27:32.751 --> 01:27:35.390
I think there's a tremendous hope for the future in America.

2915
01:27:35.391 --> 01:27:36.121
And that comes from the,

2916
01:27:36.121 --> 01:27:36.310
the,

2917
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:40.370
the awakening to consciousness of the American people.

2918
01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:42.200
And maybe it's small right now,

2919
01:27:42.230 --> 01:27:43.190
but it's growing.

2920
01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:44.690
And in that sense,

2921
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:46.580
far more than any other,

2922
01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:48.950
I believe America is leading the world.

2923
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:51.640
That there is this possibility for awakening here.

2924
01:27:51.641 --> 01:27:55.880
And maybe it goes back to the founding fathers and the frontier days and just

2925
01:27:55.881 --> 01:27:56.331
that the,

2926
01:27:56.331 --> 01:27:56.541
the,

2927
01:27:56.541 --> 01:27:56.750
the,

2928
01:27:56.750 --> 01:28:00.230
the sense that that people should be able to make decisions about their own

2929
01:28:00.231 --> 01:28:02.150
lives without government telling them what to do.

2930
01:28:02.151 --> 01:28:03.860
That's the step we all need to take.

2931
01:28:03.861 --> 01:28:04.760
We need to move ahead.

2932
01:28:04.761 --> 01:28:09.761
We need to set aside our commitment to these large monolithic religions.

2933
01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:12.830
We need to set aside our commitment to large,

2934
01:28:12.831 --> 01:28:13.940
monolithic states.

2935
01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:18.620
We need to run our own lives and make decisions for ourselves and it just

2936
01:28:18.621 --> 01:28:22.160
happens that that is very close to the heart of what America is all about.

2937
01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:22.941
Would,

2938
01:28:22.941 --> 01:28:23.850
it should be all about

2939
01:28:25.470 --> 01:28:28.310
we're living inside of the balls and the Dick that's fucking the world.

2940
01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:28.600
Yeah.

2941
01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.230
That's really what it's all about.

2942
01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.210
Living inside the balls.

2943
01:28:32.211 --> 01:28:36.680
You're in a position to give that dig this fucking the world a real well without

2944
01:28:36.681 --> 01:28:39.710
even better is if the deck would just get shit together.

2945
01:28:40.050 --> 01:28:40.800
Yeah.

2946
01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:41.633
It's,

2947
01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.540
it's all going to be done by the American people or the by the,

2948
01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:46.250
by the awakening of the American people.

2949
01:28:46.251 --> 01:28:46.731
And they will say,

2950
01:28:46.731 --> 01:28:49.550
enough is enough and we will not accept this crap anymore.

2951
01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:53.000
And slowly but surely the old guard dies off or,

2952
01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.940
and then there's huge industry of brainwashing which goes on,

2953
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.550
makes it difficult for people to think for themselves.

2954
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.690
Um,

2955
01:28:59.690 --> 01:29:00.111
you know,

2956
01:29:00.111 --> 01:29:01.090
it's very washing.

2957
01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:02.940
Like how well through the media,

2958
01:29:02.941 --> 01:29:03.774
I mean just through,

2959
01:29:03.790 --> 01:29:04.201
through the,

2960
01:29:04.201 --> 01:29:04.861
through the controls.

2961
01:29:04.861 --> 01:29:07.260
So there's this whole ethic that our lives,

2962
01:29:07.261 --> 01:29:11.400
I suppose to be about production and consumption and nothing else that we define

2963
01:29:11.401 --> 01:29:12.930
ourselves in terms of what we owed.

2964
01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:17.010
We're prepared to go into huge debt to own a shiny car or you know,

2965
01:29:17.011 --> 01:29:18.510
a better house and,

2966
01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:19.180
and uh,

2967
01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:20.940
that's supposed to be right and proper.

2968
01:29:20.970 --> 01:29:21.271
And,

2969
01:29:21.271 --> 01:29:21.571
and,

2970
01:29:21.571 --> 01:29:22.470
and then we're supposed to,

2971
01:29:22.471 --> 01:29:24.600
we define ourselves in terms of our consumption.

2972
01:29:24.910 --> 01:29:25.181
Uh,

2973
01:29:25.181 --> 01:29:26.520
and we must work hard.

2974
01:29:26.521 --> 01:29:28.090
We must go to the office every day.

2975
01:29:28.091 --> 01:29:28.921
We must all of these,

2976
01:29:28.921 --> 01:29:30.360
all of these things are brainwashing.

2977
01:29:30.361 --> 01:29:30.960
And then,

2978
01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.220
and then there's the TV.

2979
01:29:32.221 --> 01:29:33.570
We can have a little relaxation,

2980
01:29:33.571 --> 01:29:34.860
we can enjoy some fantasy,

2981
01:29:34.861 --> 01:29:36.480
maybe we'll win the lottery one day.

2982
01:29:36.630 --> 01:29:38.580
All of these are mechanisms of control,

2983
01:29:38.730 --> 01:29:39.060
which,

2984
01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:41.880
which keep people quiet in society and distraction.

2985
01:29:41.881 --> 01:29:42.290
Yeah.

2986
01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:43.970
<v 5>Distractions from the great beyond.</v>

2987
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:49.030
It's just there's too much out there to really stop and think about the fact

2988
01:29:49.491 --> 01:29:51.590
that your body's going to slowly expire.

2989
01:29:52.110 --> 01:29:54.920
Even the sun that heats the world itself is going to die out.

2990
01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:59.300
And I think the possibilities when we really consider them all are pretty

2991
01:29:59.301 --> 01:29:59.841
terrifying.

2992
01:29:59.841 --> 01:30:02.570
So we watched storage wars,

2993
01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:03.220
you know,

2994
01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:04.110
do you have storage warrants?

2995
01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:05.083
No.

2996
01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.020
One of the best shows ever.

2997
01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:06.710
Not really.

2998
01:30:06.710 --> 01:30:07.310
It's terrible.

2999
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:08.870
But I mean it's hilarious.

3000
01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:13.820
They go to storage units that people haven't paid for and they open up the door

3001
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:15.230
and they find things in there and like,

3002
01:30:15.231 --> 01:30:15.710
Whoa,

3003
01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:16.311
what is this?

3004
01:30:16.311 --> 01:30:17.360
And they bid on the door.

3005
01:30:17.361 --> 01:30:20.900
Like if there's like 10 people sitting around and they all bid on the contents

3006
01:30:20.901 --> 01:30:21.591
and if you get lucky,

3007
01:30:21.591 --> 01:30:21.951
who knows?

3008
01:30:21.951 --> 01:30:25.310
It might be gold bullying in there that someone saved or not.

3009
01:30:25.710 --> 01:30:30.530
So these idiots go and open up these boxes and then pull shit out.

3010
01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:35.330
And then it turns out that it's not even really what the contents were.

3011
01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:38.450
They added fake contents to these storage places.

3012
01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:39.500
Right.

3013
01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.370
But people watch it.

3014
01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:40.460
Yeah.

3015
01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:41.540
<v 3>They just stay distracted.</v>

3016
01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:43.220
It's a distraction.

3017
01:30:43.221 --> 01:30:43.571
So,

3018
01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:45.140
so if we're going to wake up,

3019
01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:46.040
um,

3020
01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:50.660
we have to overthrow these systems of mental control,

3021
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:51.170
which are,

3022
01:30:51.170 --> 01:30:52.130
which are in place

3023
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:54.950
<v 5>take responsibility for your own time.</v>

3024
01:30:55.250 --> 01:30:56.083
Because those,

3025
01:30:56.210 --> 01:30:58.700
those distractions are just their money extractors.

3026
01:30:58.701 --> 01:30:59.360
That's what they are.

3027
01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:00.110
They're all money,

3028
01:31:00.110 --> 01:31:00.943
their own money.

3029
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:03.740
They're selling tide or Toyota trucks or whatever the hell they're selling.

3030
01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:03.980
Yeah.

3031
01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:04.671
And you know,

3032
01:31:04.671 --> 01:31:06.020
they're just putting on this thing cause that's,

3033
01:31:06.021 --> 01:31:06.351
it's a,

3034
01:31:06.351 --> 01:31:08.360
it's a machine that they can press and it just,

3035
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:11.060
it's like an automatic program that runs and extracts money.

3036
01:31:11.061 --> 01:31:13.100
It's not really necessarily a work of art.

3037
01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:13.521
It's just,

3038
01:31:13.521 --> 01:31:13.731
you know,

3039
01:31:13.731 --> 01:31:14.600
you've made a hack,

3040
01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:15.800
terrifying prospect,

3041
01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:16.931
but it doesn't,

3042
01:31:16.931 --> 01:31:17.960
you don't have to do it.

3043
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.201
You know,

3044
01:31:18.201 --> 01:31:21.230
I think what people really need is what,

3045
01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:21.790
you know,

3046
01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:22.551
it sounds crazy,

3047
01:31:22.551 --> 01:31:26.840
but people really need is guys like you to talk about things guys like you to

3048
01:31:26.841 --> 01:31:29.150
put ideas out there that makes them go,

3049
01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:29.541
yeah,

3050
01:31:29.541 --> 01:31:30.440
what am I doing?

3051
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.590
Yeah,

3052
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:35.590
what is this and what is and start the ball rolling of rethinking their,

3053
01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:36.750
their thoughts.

3054
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:37.583
<v 3>Yes,</v>

3055
01:31:38.350 --> 01:31:40.360
rethinking is a badly needed.

3056
01:31:40.690 --> 01:31:41.381
It's everything,

3057
01:31:41.381 --> 01:31:42.200
right?

3058
01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:43.001
It's everything.

3059
01:31:43.001 --> 01:31:48.001
And I do and I do think that it's something that I bang on about a lot is the

3060
01:31:48.191 --> 01:31:50.110
issue of sovereignty over consciousness.

3061
01:31:50.710 --> 01:31:53.200
That is to me just one of the very,

3062
01:31:53.201 --> 01:31:53.441
very,

3063
01:31:53.441 --> 01:31:57.160
very key issues which a lot a lot of people have been persuaded not ever to

3064
01:31:57.161 --> 01:31:57.700
think about.

3065
01:31:57.700 --> 01:31:59.020
But once you start thinking about it,

3066
01:31:59.110 --> 01:32:00.340
you realize that this mysterious,

3067
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:02.050
<v 4>and we don't even know what consciousness is,</v>

3068
01:32:02.051 --> 01:32:02.411
you know,

3069
01:32:02.411 --> 01:32:03.244
I mean there is no,

3070
01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:05.560
there is no clear science on what it is or,

3071
01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:06.730
or to explain it.

3072
01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:10.390
But we know we've got it and whatever it is,

3073
01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:12.100
it's the essence of ourselves.

3074
01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:17.220
And why can we not make sovereign decisions over the most intimate and personal

3075
01:32:17.321 --> 01:32:18.610
part of ourselves as crazy.

3076
01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:19.311
And,

3077
01:32:19.311 --> 01:32:22.450
and when I find when you put that to put that to people,

3078
01:32:22.451 --> 01:32:23.980
even even to arch Republicans,

3079
01:32:23.981 --> 01:32:24.400
you know,

3080
01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.210
they get it,

3081
01:32:25.210 --> 01:32:26.530
they suddenly realize,

3082
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:27.281
you know,

3083
01:32:27.281 --> 01:32:27.901
that even,

3084
01:32:27.901 --> 01:32:28.110
um,

3085
01:32:28.110 --> 01:32:28.270
that,

3086
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:28.441
that,

3087
01:32:28.441 --> 01:32:31.660
that they actually legal legalizing psychedelics is a republican issue.

3088
01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:32.660
<v 5>I'll tell you what the problem is,</v>

3089
01:32:32.661 --> 01:32:34.460
Graham Hancock is the children where you're,

3090
01:32:34.461 --> 01:32:37.730
you're ignoring is Yuri endorsing drug use to children.

3091
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:39.890
And I think that's incredibly irresponsible.

3092
01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:42.140
<v 4>That's exactly what Ted said when they banned my tool.</v>

3093
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:44.571
What did that statements,

3094
01:32:44.571 --> 01:32:48.860
they said that we can't allow this talk to be on the air because some young man

3095
01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:54.100
might go off to South America and drink IOWASCA that's so hilariously bad.

3096
01:32:54.290 --> 01:32:58.100
CanNot be seen to be endorsing the drinking of Iowa.

3097
01:32:58.140 --> 01:32:59.220
<v 5>Is that the what?</v>

3098
01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:00.930
There wasn't a huge issue with you.

3099
01:33:00.931 --> 01:33:01.411
And by the way,

3100
01:33:01.411 --> 01:33:06.360
your issue was after Eddie Wong came in here and as long told his gross story

3101
01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:07.470
that makes you just go,

3102
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.920
oh,

3103
01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:08.730
ted.

3104
01:33:08.730 --> 01:33:11.010
Apparently John Anthony West has a 10 story as well.

3105
01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:11.850
Um,

3106
01:33:11.850 --> 01:33:14.430
and I think that there's,

3107
01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:15.293
uh,

3108
01:33:15.410 --> 01:33:18.420
a lot of beautiful things had come out of tech,

3109
01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:19.950
a lot of incredible tools,

3110
01:33:20.150 --> 01:33:22.890
but it seems like any organization,

3111
01:33:22.891 --> 01:33:27.891
once people get into power and once people have the ability to tell other people

3112
01:33:28.081 --> 01:33:29.460
what's cool and what's not cool,

3113
01:33:29.730 --> 01:33:32.580
it starts getting weird and you start telling Eddie Wong he has to attend all

3114
01:33:32.581 --> 01:33:36.270
these different things and meet all these donors and like some kind of freaky

3115
01:33:36.271 --> 01:33:36.740
cult.

3116
01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:37.100
Yeah.

3117
01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:38.070
Well that's what he felt like.

3118
01:33:38.230 --> 01:33:39.390
You felt like it was really strange.

3119
01:33:39.450 --> 01:33:40.460
Now your,

3120
01:33:40.461 --> 01:33:41.670
your thing got pulled.

3121
01:33:41.671 --> 01:33:45.780
And what was the scientific explanation for why they got polled?

3122
01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:46.270
Um,

3123
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.691
was there,

3124
01:33:46.691 --> 01:33:47.461
was you,

3125
01:33:47.461 --> 01:33:51.120
you had an exchange with one of the guys on Ted.

3126
01:33:51.121 --> 01:33:55.080
I read the comments and you presented all the things that he had said and said,

3127
01:33:55.081 --> 01:33:57.300
please show your example of when I said this,

3128
01:33:57.301 --> 01:33:58.134
I never said this.

3129
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:59.303
What were the various,

3130
01:33:59.310 --> 01:34:01.590
what was the thing that he accused you of and what was the response?

3131
01:34:02.190 --> 01:34:03.320
<v 4>Got Our talks deleted.</v>

3132
01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:05.170
Rupert Sheldrake sheltering is the other,

3133
01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:05.511
his toe,

3134
01:34:05.511 --> 01:34:07.070
it was called the science delusion might talk,

3135
01:34:07.071 --> 01:34:08.300
was called the war on consciousness.

3136
01:34:08.530 --> 01:34:11.380
<v 5>He can't be shitting on science like that called the science to illusion.</v>

3137
01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:11.950
Rupert,

3138
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:14.760
how dare you poked it was as though it was as though

3139
01:34:14.830 --> 01:34:19.420
<v 4>Ted felt that these talks must automatically be wrong and that they had some</v>

3140
01:34:19.421 --> 01:34:21.280
kind of preconception about what we were saying.

3141
01:34:21.281 --> 01:34:24.970
So they didn't even bother to sit down and listen to the actual 18 minute talks,

3142
01:34:24.971 --> 01:34:25.990
not that much to listen to,

3143
01:34:25.991 --> 01:34:26.500
you know,

3144
01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.600
before deleting it from their youtube channel.

3145
01:34:28.810 --> 01:34:30.760
They just said this is pseudoscience.

3146
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:31.211
Uh,

3147
01:34:31.211 --> 01:34:31.780
it's full of,

3148
01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:34.840
and they listed a series of false statements that we'd supposedly made,

3149
01:34:35.050 --> 01:34:37.810
but the problem was neither I nor Rupert had made those statements.

3150
01:34:37.950 --> 01:34:39.900
<v 5>So they never even bothered to look at it.</v>

3151
01:34:39.901 --> 01:34:41.980
They just read complaints and then responding.

3152
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:43.160
None of

3153
01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:43.890
<v 4>the basis of those.</v>

3154
01:34:43.890 --> 01:34:45.030
So when we challenged them,

3155
01:34:45.031 --> 01:34:45.241
okay,

3156
01:34:45.241 --> 01:34:46.920
please go through in my case,

3157
01:34:46.921 --> 01:34:48.060
go through my talk and,

3158
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:53.270
and find where I say that Iowasca allows you to communicate with an ancient

3159
01:34:54.811 --> 01:34:55.710
mother culture.

3160
01:34:55.770 --> 01:34:56.670
Where do I say that?

3161
01:34:56.671 --> 01:34:57.260
I never,

3162
01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.093
that in my talk,

3163
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:00.080
I never said any such thing in my talk.

3164
01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:01.730
They actually couldn't do it.

3165
01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:02.520
And,

3166
01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:03.950
and something you've said before?

3167
01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:04.460
No,

3168
01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:05.300
I've never seen that.

3169
01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.590
I've never said that right now.

3170
01:35:06.591 --> 01:35:07.424
I heard you.

3171
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:12.230
What I talked about was the mother got,

3172
01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:14.780
or the experience of an encounter with a man that God is,

3173
01:35:14.781 --> 01:35:18.200
but I never said it allows you to communicate with an ancient mother culture,

3174
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:19.670
like a lost civilization.

3175
01:35:19.671 --> 01:35:21.740
They knew I had written books about lost civilizations,

3176
01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:23.530
so they thought I must be bringing the,

3177
01:35:23.531 --> 01:35:25.850
my lost civilization beef into the,

3178
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:27.260
into my ted talk,

3179
01:35:27.261 --> 01:35:27.680
which I did.

3180
01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:29.540
And it didn't have anything to do with lost civilization.

3181
01:35:29.541 --> 01:35:30.374
It was a talk about,

3182
01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:31.670
talk about consciousness anyway.

3183
01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:32.331
And the real,

3184
01:35:32.331 --> 01:35:35.260
the original version was giving up the green bitch where you were talking to

3185
01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:35.661
recently.

3186
01:35:35.661 --> 01:35:36.890
I originally called the talk,

3187
01:35:36.891 --> 01:35:37.650
giving up the Greens.

3188
01:35:37.650 --> 01:35:41.060
I watch shows because I was giving my personal story of,

3189
01:35:41.061 --> 01:35:41.421
of,

3190
01:35:41.421 --> 01:35:41.880
of,

3191
01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:42.200
uh,

3192
01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:42.441
you know,

3193
01:35:42.441 --> 01:35:42.910
why I,

3194
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:45.080
why I gave up her cannabis.

3195
01:35:45.450 --> 01:35:45.890
Um,

3196
01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:48.830
I changed that title because a lot of people pointed out to me that that's

3197
01:35:48.831 --> 01:35:51.230
deeply disrespectful of cannabis and that for many people,

3198
01:35:51.231 --> 01:35:54.770
cannabis is a green goddess and cannabis was a green goddess for me.

3199
01:35:54.771 --> 01:35:55.521
And I accepted that.

3200
01:35:55.521 --> 01:35:56.780
So that got to those people,

3201
01:35:56.781 --> 01:35:58.370
I'd say fucking relax.

3202
01:35:58.700 --> 01:35:59.120
Okay.

3203
01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.110
Cause I love cannabis.

3204
01:36:00.111 --> 01:36:00.411
To me,

3205
01:36:00.411 --> 01:36:01.280
it didn't bother me.

3206
01:36:01.810 --> 01:36:03.530
People got really upset.

3207
01:36:03.531 --> 01:36:04.770
I realized that to be absurd,

3208
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:07.760
I realized that there is in fact a cannabis orthodoxy as well,

3209
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:10.510
which I wish my wish by talking about my,

3210
01:36:10.690 --> 01:36:11.030
my,

3211
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:12.050
my quitting of cannabis,

3212
01:36:12.051 --> 01:36:13.490
I hit upset this orthodoxy.

3213
01:36:13.730 --> 01:36:15.020
But when I looked at my talk,

3214
01:36:15.021 --> 01:36:18.410
my talk was much more about the war on consciousness than it was about that.

3215
01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:19.550
And that's what it was really about.

3216
01:36:19.551 --> 01:36:20.390
So for example,

3217
01:36:20.391 --> 01:36:22.070
I made the point that,

3218
01:36:22.071 --> 01:36:22.670
um,

3219
01:36:22.670 --> 01:36:26.270
our society doesn't object in principle to altering consciousness.

3220
01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:26.811
I mean,

3221
01:36:26.811 --> 01:36:28.820
what happens when you put a kid on Ritalin?

3222
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.361
You know,

3223
01:36:29.361 --> 01:36:31.490
that's a powerful pharmacological drug,

3224
01:36:31.491 --> 01:36:33.590
which is altering consciousness when you win,

3225
01:36:33.591 --> 01:36:38.591
you over prescribed Prozac or Ciroc sat for conditions of depression that those

3226
01:36:39.441 --> 01:36:40.970
drugs are altering consciousness.

3227
01:36:40.971 --> 01:36:42.170
We value alcohol.

3228
01:36:42.171 --> 01:36:42.700
We invest,

3229
01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:42.900
you know,

3230
01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:45.260
have multibillion dollar alcohol industry.

3231
01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.380
People don't primarily Rick drink alcohol because of the taste.

3232
01:36:48.381 --> 01:36:51.260
They drink it because it alters their consciousness in a way that they like.

3233
01:36:51.610 --> 01:36:51.880
And,

3234
01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:54.860
and so we don't object to altering consciousness in principle,

3235
01:36:54.861 --> 01:36:58.460
but we object to altering consciousness in certain kinds of ways which threaten

3236
01:36:58.461 --> 01:36:59.420
the status quo.

3237
01:36:59.870 --> 01:37:01.460
And that's what psychedelics do.

3238
01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:05.870
They alter consciousness in ways that lead people to ask profound questions

3239
01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:08.240
about the nature of the society they live in.

3240
01:37:08.241 --> 01:37:10.310
And that appears to be the line that I crossed.

3241
01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:14.060
So Ted tied to try to dress it up as pseudoscience.

3242
01:37:14.061 --> 01:37:17.930
And when I called them on that in the end because they realized I think that

3243
01:37:17.931 --> 01:37:18.320
they were,

3244
01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.680
they'd got themselves into some kind of danger and it's still there on the,

3245
01:37:21.681 --> 01:37:23.870
on the webpage that w Rupert and I call it,

3246
01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:24.800
they're naughty corner,

3247
01:37:25.110 --> 01:37:28.110
they created a naughty corner of the Ted website where I've talked to him quick

3248
01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:31.400
back on line and with all their reasons why they've taken them off.

3249
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:34.400
So first thing they did was they crossed out all their reasons.

3250
01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:38.090
So you can find that everything they said has actually been crossed out.

3251
01:37:38.150 --> 01:37:40.430
And then they published our rebuttals completely.

3252
01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:41.393
We know,

3253
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:44.960
we insisted that they accepted that nothing they'd said was true,

3254
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:46.970
but we insisted they leave it there.

3255
01:37:46.971 --> 01:37:48.020
On the public record,

3256
01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:49.700
but put a line through it.

3257
01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:50.390
Oh Wow.

3258
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.760
So that,

3259
01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:51.540
so that they did,

3260
01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:52.373
they did that.

3261
01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:53.450
They did that.

3262
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:54.140
Oh my God,

3263
01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:55.920
they did that and then they of a cool victory.

3264
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:56.640
I know,

3265
01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:57.151
I know.

3266
01:37:57.151 --> 01:37:58.830
And they published our rebuttals in full,

3267
01:37:58.950 --> 01:38:01.200
but it wasn't a complete victory because what they didn't do,

3268
01:38:01.201 --> 01:38:04.530
which is all we wanted was for our talks to burry it reinstated on the TEDX

3269
01:38:04.531 --> 01:38:05.220
youtube channel.

3270
01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:05.521
No,

3271
01:38:05.521 --> 01:38:05.731
no,

3272
01:38:05.731 --> 01:38:05.911
no.

3273
01:38:05.911 --> 01:38:06.211
Only that.

3274
01:38:06.211 --> 01:38:07.260
But you can't put your tea,

3275
01:38:07.290 --> 01:38:09.090
your talk online yourself.

3276
01:38:09.330 --> 01:38:09.691
Well,

3277
01:38:09.691 --> 01:38:10.051
no,

3278
01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:10.281
I've,

3279
01:38:10.281 --> 01:38:14.910
I have put my talk on line myself and [inaudible] so have about a hundred other

3280
01:38:14.911 --> 01:38:15.780
youtube channels.

3281
01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:21.540
And I think Ted took such a massive beating over this for a big,

3282
01:38:21.541 --> 01:38:23.400
because it clearly was an act of censorship.

3283
01:38:23.730 --> 01:38:24.151
However,

3284
01:38:24.151 --> 01:38:27.720
they tried to dress it up that they've decided not to go and pull,

3285
01:38:27.970 --> 01:38:28.430
uh,

3286
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:29.580
the talks from,

3287
01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.361
from Youtube,

3288
01:38:30.361 --> 01:38:31.920
which probably probably they could do.

3289
01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:32.460
So,

3290
01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:32.761
I mean,

3291
01:38:32.761 --> 01:38:37.050
my talk had 132,000 views on youtube on their channel when they pulled it.

3292
01:38:37.290 --> 01:38:40.350
But since then it's had hundreds of thousands of more views all over the

3293
01:38:40.351 --> 01:38:40.801
internet.

3294
01:38:40.801 --> 01:38:41.131
So,

3295
01:38:41.131 --> 01:38:41.491
you know,

3296
01:38:41.491 --> 01:38:41.910
they the,

3297
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:44.040
rather than actually suppress the talk,

3298
01:38:44.490 --> 01:38:46.110
I think it's called the Streisand effect,

3299
01:38:46.111 --> 01:38:46.321
you know,

3300
01:38:46.321 --> 01:38:47.550
rather than suppress the talks,

3301
01:38:47.551 --> 01:38:48.540
they ended up multiplying.

3302
01:38:48.541 --> 01:38:51.060
Same but same with customers apparently.

3303
01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:51.953
Apparently the,

3304
01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:56.240
I think it was by Australia and tried to stop some public statement that had

3305
01:38:56.241 --> 01:38:58.830
been made about her and it ended up multiplying the statement.

3306
01:38:58.831 --> 01:38:59.041
You know,

3307
01:38:59.041 --> 01:38:59.730
when you try it,

3308
01:38:59.730 --> 01:39:01.050
this is the great thing about the Internet.

3309
01:39:01.051 --> 01:39:02.760
When you try to suppress something,

3310
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.870
it grows,

3311
01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:05.250
it doesn't get suppressed.

3312
01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:07.260
The Internet is sucking Dick Pictures.

3313
01:39:08.230 --> 01:39:11.700
One of those out there come back around Graham Hancock.

3314
01:39:11.890 --> 01:39:12.723
I'm going to find you.

3315
01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:15.270
I've never had my dick photograph.

3316
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:16.350
Congratulations.

3317
01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:17.213
How about you

3318
01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:19.813
<v 5>plead the fifth?</v>

3319
01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:21.110
Um,

3320
01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:22.930
so now the,

3321
01:39:22.931 --> 01:39:23.291
the,

3322
01:39:23.291 --> 01:39:23.600
the,

3323
01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.430
the page got polled your,

3324
01:39:25.431 --> 01:39:27.440
your talk on polled it got reinstated.

3325
01:39:27.441 --> 01:39:30.920
They crossed a line and put up in the naughty corner.

3326
01:39:30.921 --> 01:39:32.810
But at least it's on youtube as well.

3327
01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:33.880
And um,

3328
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:37.220
is it possible that this is what I know?

3329
01:39:37.250 --> 01:39:37.730
Okay.

3330
01:39:37.730 --> 01:39:38.151
I,

3331
01:39:38.151 --> 01:39:38.980
uh,

3332
01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:39.950
I really love your work.

3333
01:39:39.951 --> 01:39:41.710
I've been a fan ever since,

3334
01:39:41.711 --> 01:39:41.900
uh,

3335
01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:42.980
fingerprints of the gods.

3336
01:39:43.130 --> 01:39:46.990
It was a fascinating book that really changed the way I looked at history there.

3337
01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:48.110
I think you're a brilliant guy,

3338
01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:50.480
but I take more shit for,

3339
01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:52.840
for you from the like six streams,

3340
01:39:52.850 --> 01:39:53.870
science dorks.

3341
01:39:54.110 --> 01:39:56.180
I take more shit about having you.

3342
01:39:56.270 --> 01:40:01.110
Well it's Bram Hancock gonna come on your podcast and in pump out his pseudo

3343
01:40:01.111 --> 01:40:01.944
science.

3344
01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:07.020
It's like so many people get so twatty about you and it's a science thing and it

3345
01:40:08.841 --> 01:40:11.030
could be mistakes that you've made in the past.

3346
01:40:11.031 --> 01:40:13.280
We all make them that they want to Chirp on.

3347
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:13.730
Uh,

3348
01:40:13.730 --> 01:40:15.320
it could be the whole Mars thing,

3349
01:40:15.370 --> 01:40:18.650
the whole face on Mars think I look cookie with that kind of look cookie with

3350
01:40:18.651 --> 01:40:18.861
that.

3351
01:40:18.861 --> 01:40:20.210
Still think it's an interesting phenomena.

3352
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:21.140
It is interesting.

3353
01:40:21.170 --> 01:40:23.060
There's a lot of interesting rocks on Mars.

3354
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.580
It,

3355
01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:26.630
it might have at one point in time how to culture.

3356
01:40:26.631 --> 01:40:27.560
I don't know what they are.

3357
01:40:27.561 --> 01:40:28.100
No,

3358
01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:29.840
<v 4>we need to need to do we need to do more work,</v>

3359
01:40:29.841 --> 01:40:30.111
but yeah,

3360
01:40:30.111 --> 01:40:30.351
I do.

3361
01:40:30.351 --> 01:40:30.871
I haven't,

3362
01:40:30.871 --> 01:40:30.991
no,

3363
01:40:30.991 --> 01:40:31.824
I'd scientists,

3364
01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:32.571
I tell you what,

3365
01:40:32.571 --> 01:40:33.590
it's not actually.

3366
01:40:33.670 --> 01:40:33.830
I,

3367
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:35.060
I've certainly made mistakes.

3368
01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:35.993
Right?

3369
01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:37.770
<v 5>What about a junk DNA?</v>

3370
01:40:37.771 --> 01:40:38.131
There was,

3371
01:40:38.131 --> 01:40:38.460
uh,

3372
01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:39.330
something about,

3373
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.500
uh,

3374
01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:40.890
the contents of junk DNA.

3375
01:40:40.891 --> 01:40:42.500
That's one thing that they keep harping,

3376
01:40:44.130 --> 01:40:45.390
erroneously stated,

3377
01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:46.170
you know,

3378
01:40:46.170 --> 01:40:48.960
something about the knowledge that we have of junk DNA.

3379
01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:49.441
<v 4>Well,</v>

3380
01:40:49.441 --> 01:40:49.511
uh,

3381
01:40:49.511 --> 01:40:49.871
yes,

3382
01:40:49.871 --> 01:40:53.760
I said that 97% of DNA is defined as and,

3383
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:54.290
and uh,

3384
01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:55.123
maybe it isn't.

3385
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:55.660
Um,

3386
01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:56.261
and that,

3387
01:40:56.261 --> 01:40:56.710
uh,

3388
01:40:56.710 --> 01:40:59.860
there may be data stored on DNA.

3389
01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:00.700
Um,

3390
01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:03.070
and as a matter of fact that this is now being done,

3391
01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:04.660
data is being stored on DNA.

3392
01:41:04.890 --> 01:41:05.723
Um,

3393
01:41:06.210 --> 01:41:07.043
misinformed.

3394
01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:08.110
Um,

3395
01:41:08.110 --> 01:41:09.580
I don't think that I was misinformed.

3396
01:41:09.581 --> 01:41:11.500
I think that I was exploring an interesting,

3397
01:41:11.501 --> 01:41:12.940
an interesting area of inquiry.

3398
01:41:12.941 --> 01:41:17.170
That's true since I published on that in 2005 that some new workers could have

3399
01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:20.290
been done on junk so called junk DNA and it is found to have,

3400
01:41:20.291 --> 01:41:20.680
uh,

3401
01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:23.140
an important bio physical function.

3402
01:41:23.470 --> 01:41:23.950
Um,

3403
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:24.970
but what I,

3404
01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:27.040
what I reported,

3405
01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:32.280
and this was in my book supernatural in 2005 was a study published in the

3406
01:41:32.561 --> 01:41:34.960
magazine science by Eugene Stanley.

3407
01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:35.890
Um,

3408
01:41:35.890 --> 01:41:40.120
which looked at the language like structure of junk DNA.

3409
01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:42.160
The junk DNA has a structure,

3410
01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:45.370
a very similar to all human languages.

3411
01:41:45.370 --> 01:41:49.000
There are certain patterns that repeat in languages that appear also in junk

3412
01:41:49.001 --> 01:41:49.834
DNA.

3413
01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:50.590
Um,

3414
01:41:50.590 --> 01:41:53.860
and this I simply wanted to speculate on this.

3415
01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:57.310
Is it possible that junk DNA is some kind of archive?

3416
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:58.330
I was looking,

3417
01:41:58.330 --> 01:41:58.750
you know,

3418
01:41:58.750 --> 01:41:59.920
in when I wrote supernatural,

3419
01:41:59.921 --> 01:42:04.750
I was looking at this connection with entities that people have in altered

3420
01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:05.890
states of consciousness.

3421
01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:06.640
And,

3422
01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:11.640
and I were saying that kind of place I would bet on is that in some weird way

3423
01:42:12.341 --> 01:42:13.780
these entities may be real.

3424
01:42:14.170 --> 01:42:18.330
That is in itself a very annoying statement to make to any materials scientist,

3425
01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:18.610
right?

3426
01:42:18.610 --> 01:42:19.421
But then I said,

3427
01:42:19.421 --> 01:42:19.511
well,

3428
01:42:19.511 --> 01:42:21.040
maybe there's another possibility.

3429
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:22.870
Maybe there's a,

3430
01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:28.080
an archive of information stored on all our DNA all around the world.

3431
01:42:28.751 --> 01:42:30.490
And maybe in altered states of consciousness,

3432
01:42:30.491 --> 01:42:31.840
we gain access to the archive.

3433
01:42:31.841 --> 01:42:35.020
And that's maybe why people from all different cultures at different periods of

3434
01:42:35.021 --> 01:42:36.460
history see the same thing.

3435
01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:41.460
And I cited the work of Francis Crick who was the discoverer of the double helix

3436
01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:44.770
form of DNA,

3437
01:42:45.370 --> 01:42:45.731
uh,

3438
01:42:45.731 --> 01:42:48.100
in a book that he wrote called life itself,

3439
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:52.780
where Crick speculates that DNA did not evolve on this planet.

3440
01:42:52.810 --> 01:42:53.221
This is the,

3441
01:42:53.221 --> 01:42:54.610
this is the Nobel Prize winner,

3442
01:42:54.611 --> 01:42:55.444
Francis Crick.

3443
01:42:55.450 --> 01:42:57.460
This is not Graham Hancock who is making the statement,

3444
01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:02.590
crikey suggests a phenomenon called directed Panspermia that,

3445
01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:03.041
uh,

3446
01:43:03.041 --> 01:43:07.810
that the reason that life exploded so rapidly and amazingly on this planet

3447
01:43:07.811 --> 01:43:10.900
within a hundred million years of the planet being cool enough to support life

3448
01:43:10.901 --> 01:43:13.120
roughly 4 billion years ago,

3449
01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:17.020
the reason that it exploded so suddenly was that he came here from elsewhere and

3450
01:43:17.021 --> 01:43:21.070
he suggested that there had been some advanced alien culture on the other side

3451
01:43:21.071 --> 01:43:24.160
of the galaxy that faced annihilation.

3452
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:28.240
Perhaps a supernova was going to go off in their vicinity and they look

3453
01:43:28.241 --> 01:43:30.790
desperately for some way to preserve life.

3454
01:43:30.791 --> 01:43:33.280
And their first thought was could they get themselves off the planet?

3455
01:43:33.670 --> 01:43:35.500
And they realized that yes they could,

3456
01:43:35.530 --> 01:43:40.530
but that they could not travel through interstellar space for thousands or

3457
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:42.970
millions of years to reach other possibly habitable planets.

3458
01:43:42.971 --> 01:43:43.571
So in the end,

3459
01:43:43.571 --> 01:43:48.571
what they did was they sent bacteria out into the universe on space ships and

3460
01:43:48.791 --> 01:43:52.160
they genetically engineered those bacteria to make incredibly hardy.

3461
01:43:52.161 --> 01:43:53.660
This was cricks suggestion,

3462
01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:54.853
not mine.

3463
01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:58.820
And the only thing you got to really say that the only thing I added to it was

3464
01:43:58.850 --> 01:43:59.421
if they,

3465
01:43:59.421 --> 01:44:04.421
if his theory had bit were right and that life spiraled up on this planet

3466
01:44:04.641 --> 01:44:08.660
because one of those spaceships hit the ancient earth and spilled out it's cargo

3467
01:44:08.661 --> 01:44:10.640
of genetically engineered bacteria.

3468
01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:14.870
Well maybe they wrote a message on the DNA of those bacteria and maybe that

3469
01:44:14.871 --> 01:44:16.550
message has been preserved,

3470
01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:17.630
highly preserved.

3471
01:44:17.631 --> 01:44:21.800
And there are certain strands of DNA that are preserved for for hundreds of

3472
01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:25.430
millions or billions of years and passed down into modern human beings.

3473
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:30.790
And maybe it's a message for us about that last ancestor culture that made the

3474
01:44:31.191 --> 01:44:32.180
DNA that,

3475
01:44:32.930 --> 01:44:34.070
or rather didn't make it,

3476
01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:37.460
but engineered the DNA in the bacteria that started life on earth.

3477
01:44:37.670 --> 01:44:39.380
And that eventually evolved into us.

3478
01:44:39.710 --> 01:44:44.240
And it was just an interesting inquiry as this lends credence to the idea of

3479
01:44:44.241 --> 01:44:45.800
Francis Crick did a lot of acid,

3480
01:44:45.850 --> 01:44:46.231
why would,

3481
01:44:46.231 --> 01:44:47.690
she certainly did Francis Crick,

3482
01:44:48.030 --> 01:44:48.831
I'm denying this,

3483
01:44:48.831 --> 01:44:50.630
Michio Kaku wouldn't agree with me on us.

3484
01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:52.790
Francis Crick was a big user of acid and,

3485
01:44:52.791 --> 01:44:54.050
and so we're posing alleged.

3486
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:56.480
So were many intellectuals in that period.

3487
01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:58.580
This is essentially the Prometheans story I guess.

3488
01:44:58.581 --> 01:44:59.260
A lot of ways.

3489
01:44:59.260 --> 01:44:59.540
Yeah,

3490
01:44:59.540 --> 01:44:59.930
I guess it,

3491
01:44:59.930 --> 01:45:00.560
I guess it is.

3492
01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.450
So I thought it was an interesting area to inquire.

3493
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:03.060
Quite simple.

3494
01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:03.890
For me.

3495
01:45:03.890 --> 01:45:04.723
I feel my,

3496
01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:09.500
my role is to inquire into interesting things that are forbidden territory for

3497
01:45:09.501 --> 01:45:10.370
scientists.

3498
01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:12.680
And when I inquire into them,

3499
01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:16.130
it doesn't mean that I'm insisting this is a fact.

3500
01:45:16.190 --> 01:45:16.551
It me,

3501
01:45:16.551 --> 01:45:20.210
what I'm saying is this is something that we need an alternative point of view

3502
01:45:20.211 --> 01:45:22.610
on and let's look at and consider what this,

3503
01:45:22.611 --> 01:45:23.630
what this might mean.

3504
01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:25.160
And I may be completely wrong,

3505
01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:27.260
but I think the exploration is worthwhile.

3506
01:45:27.261 --> 01:45:27.800
That's the,

3507
01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:29.060
that's the position that I take.

3508
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:30.170
It doesn't know sides.

3509
01:45:30.170 --> 01:45:33.680
I think the other reason it annoys scientists is because,

3510
01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:34.640
um,

3511
01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:36.140
I don't mean to pat myself on the back,

3512
01:45:36.141 --> 01:45:36.650
but I'm,

3513
01:45:36.650 --> 01:45:38.810
I'm not particularly lunatic,

3514
01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:39.231
you know,

3515
01:45:39.231 --> 01:45:40.490
on a day to day basis.

3516
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:42.170
I'm not particularly cookie.

3517
01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:43.820
I'm moderately rational.

3518
01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.350
I can make an argument,

3519
01:45:45.351 --> 01:45:46.730
I can express things.

3520
01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:47.520
And,

3521
01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:48.980
and I think if I was,

3522
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.760
you know,

3523
01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.230
an obvious nutcase,

3524
01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:53.570
they wouldn't need to get so angry with me.

3525
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:55.280
But because,

3526
01:45:55.281 --> 01:45:56.390
because I'm fairly,

3527
01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:58.960
I'm fairly reasonable and open to discussion and persuasion,

3528
01:45:58.980 --> 01:45:59.840
I think it makes me,

3529
01:46:00.190 --> 01:46:02.330
it makes me more a little bit more dangerous to them.

3530
01:46:02.331 --> 01:46:03.620
And it's the same with John Anthony West.

3531
01:46:03.621 --> 01:46:05.000
John is a very reasonable man.

3532
01:46:05.001 --> 01:46:05.301
You know,

3533
01:46:05.301 --> 01:46:07.700
he's coming out with extraordinary ideas about the past.

3534
01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:08.240
Uh,

3535
01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:09.380
but he's arguing them very,

3536
01:46:09.381 --> 01:46:13.400
very well and very coherently and based on based on evidence,

3537
01:46:13.710 --> 01:46:18.710
<v 3>intellectual ideas also are the battlefield of scientists and science thinkers</v>

3538
01:46:19.321 --> 01:46:20.220
in science dorks.

3539
01:46:20.250 --> 01:46:23.850
Me Proving someone incorrect is a huge feather in your cap.

3540
01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:28.770
Being able to point out inconsistencies in correcting mistakes and that's how

3541
01:46:28.771 --> 01:46:30.070
science works and that's what's,

3542
01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:31.560
that's what's great about it.

3543
01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:32.450
Yes.

3544
01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:33.061
On the one had,

3545
01:46:33.061 --> 01:46:34.260
it's what's good about science,

3546
01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:37.530
which is what what you would call destructive criticism.

3547
01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:39.240
Here is a new idea.

3548
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:42.480
Let's figure out any way we can to destroy it.

3549
01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:47.820
Anything is left after we've exposed it to that fire for a decade.

3550
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:50.010
That thing that's left

3551
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:51.360
<v 1>is probably worthwhile.</v>

3552
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:52.140
That's,

3553
01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:52.831
and that's,

3554
01:46:52.831 --> 01:46:54.450
that is the scientific method.

3555
01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:56.520
I think there's room for another method.

3556
01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:59.180
Here's this extraordinary idea that somebody put over,

3557
01:46:59.310 --> 01:47:01.020
let's look for what's good in that idea.

3558
01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:03.000
Let's see if we can find something good in that.

3559
01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:03.740
Yeah.

3560
01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:03.940
See,

3561
01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:06.990
to see if there's something possible approach just in a positive way,

3562
01:47:06.991 --> 01:47:08.460
just in a positive way rather than,

3563
01:47:08.461 --> 01:47:08.670
uh,

3564
01:47:08.670 --> 01:47:10.230
rather than a negative way.

3565
01:47:10.231 --> 01:47:10.490
So.

3566
01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:10.940
Right.

3567
01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:11.161
You know,

3568
01:47:11.161 --> 01:47:11.580
I think,

3569
01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:12.690
I think that both are,

3570
01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:14.460
both are both are possible.

3571
01:47:14.490 --> 01:47:16.050
It's the same attitude essentially.

3572
01:47:16.051 --> 01:47:16.980
You're trying to find truth.

3573
01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:17.340
Yeah.

3574
01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:17.641
It just,

3575
01:47:17.641 --> 01:47:18.320
you're saying,

3576
01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:18.630
uh,

3577
01:47:18.630 --> 01:47:18.931
is,

3578
01:47:18.931 --> 01:47:19.764
is there,

3579
01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:21.690
is there a possibility of this,

3580
01:47:21.691 --> 01:47:22.890
is there a truth in here?

3581
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:23.120
Yeah.

3582
01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:24.090
And is there a benefit?

3583
01:47:24.091 --> 01:47:28.160
Like that's what a real egyptologist would do if they examine the spanx.

3584
01:47:28.161 --> 01:47:28.501
They would say,

3585
01:47:28.501 --> 01:47:28.711
you know,

3586
01:47:28.711 --> 01:47:30.810
this really bare some consideration.

3587
01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:31.830
This is really unique.

3588
01:47:32.010 --> 01:47:33.030
It's unusual.

3589
01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:35.280
I end geologists seemed to be pointing to this,

3590
01:47:35.281 --> 01:47:35.760
let's,

3591
01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:36.150
let's,

3592
01:47:36.150 --> 01:47:37.390
let's discuss this on this,

3593
01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:40.620
spread that rather than just get rid of it right at the beginning of massively

3594
01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:42.280
destroy culture.

3595
01:47:42.281 --> 01:47:44.550
Or are we talking about from 10,000 years ago?

3596
01:47:44.551 --> 01:47:45.210
Exactly.

3597
01:47:45.210 --> 01:47:46.043
Exactly.

3598
01:47:46.110 --> 01:47:48.090
And so with this destructive methods,

3599
01:47:48.091 --> 01:47:50.820
scientists seek to destroy each other's reputations.

3600
01:47:51.210 --> 01:47:51.691
And so,

3601
01:47:51.691 --> 01:47:51.961
you know,

3602
01:47:51.961 --> 01:47:52.321
many,

3603
01:47:52.321 --> 01:47:57.321
many great individuals have suffered most painful experiences as a result of

3604
01:47:57.751 --> 01:47:57.960
this,

3605
01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:00.240
but have ended up later to be proved to be right.

3606
01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:01.321
Sometimes,

3607
01:48:01.321 --> 01:48:01.920
sometimes,

3608
01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:02.850
sometimes not.

3609
01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:05.400
It's not quacks out there too and they need to be exposed.

3610
01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:07.050
One of the things I've,

3611
01:48:07.051 --> 01:48:09.180
I'm doing this new show on the Scifi channel,

3612
01:48:09.181 --> 01:48:10.890
it's called Joe Rogan questions everything.

3613
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:11.700
And uh,

3614
01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:12.480
eventually,

3615
01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:12.711
uh,

3616
01:48:12.711 --> 01:48:17.711
where I would like to get to the mysteries of ancient civilizations and whether

3617
01:48:18.031 --> 01:48:21.130
or not there were some sort of Atlantean type civilization.

3618
01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:22.620
I would love to talk to you about this.

3619
01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:23.580
But what,

3620
01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:28.580
what I'm seeing when I'm doing this show is how important science really is.

3621
01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:33.920
I'm getting an a massive dose of the reality of how many people are really Kooky

3622
01:48:35.611 --> 01:48:40.611
out there and have some really kooky ideas that they cling to like a cat stuck

3623
01:48:41.461 --> 01:48:45.120
in a tree or Cody's fucking cookie ideas.

3624
01:48:45.330 --> 01:48:49.020
And no matter how many experts you bring in there that are true experts on

3625
01:48:49.050 --> 01:48:50.880
whatever subject it is at hand.

3626
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:54.000
If that person has a Kooky idea that they've clung to,

3627
01:48:54.210 --> 01:48:56.130
they are not letting that fucking thing go.

3628
01:48:56.850 --> 01:48:58.220
That's why science is so important.

3629
01:48:58.240 --> 01:48:58.770
Science is,

3630
01:48:58.770 --> 01:49:00.060
science is incredibly important.

3631
01:49:00.061 --> 01:49:01.090
It's the ego and pride.

3632
01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:01.651
It's a pride.

3633
01:49:01.651 --> 01:49:06.000
I'm sitting here in this chair where the painfree hip as a result of science.

3634
01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:06.600
Yeah,

3635
01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:07.500
that is science.

3636
01:49:07.530 --> 01:49:09.510
Science gave me my legs back.

3637
01:49:09.570 --> 01:49:11.610
Science gave me my mobility sciences,

3638
01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:12.121
how we're doing this.

3639
01:49:12.121 --> 01:49:14.280
Podcast science is how we're doing this podcast.

3640
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.761
It's a,

3641
01:49:14.761 --> 01:49:16.020
it's a wonderful thing.

3642
01:49:16.021 --> 01:49:17.340
It's an incredible instrument.

3643
01:49:17.370 --> 01:49:19.260
We should not despise it in itself,

3644
01:49:19.710 --> 01:49:21.300
but we should I think,

3645
01:49:21.330 --> 01:49:25.680
be open to the view that there are other modes of inquiry into the nature of

3646
01:49:25.681 --> 01:49:26.514
reality,

3647
01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.950
which should be also considered.

3648
01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:29.793
It could even be done,

3649
01:49:29.970 --> 01:49:30.570
done,

3650
01:49:30.570 --> 01:49:32.280
done scientifically.

3651
01:49:32.590 --> 01:49:32.970
Uh,

3652
01:49:32.970 --> 01:49:33.661
for example,

3653
01:49:33.661 --> 01:49:36.870
psychedelics are a marvelous tool for inquiring into consciousness,

3654
01:49:36.871 --> 01:49:38.100
this mystery of consciousness.

3655
01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:40.600
And we could have detailed scientific study.

3656
01:49:40.601 --> 01:49:44.100
So he has the hypothesis with psychedelics.

3657
01:49:44.101 --> 01:49:47.410
We reach you in the receiver wavelength of the brain and gate hypothesis.

3658
01:49:47.411 --> 01:49:48.190
Mind you and gain

3659
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:50.020
<v 4>access to other levels of reality,</v>

3660
01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:51.640
parallel universes if you like,

3661
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:53.920
which are inhabited by intelligent beings.

3662
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:55.000
Okay,

3663
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.250
let's explore that hypothesis scientifically.

3664
01:49:57.251 --> 01:49:58.270
How are we going to do that?

3665
01:49:59.020 --> 01:49:59.700
Psychedelics?

3666
01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:00.720
Very best way.

3667
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:04.090
Put people into deeply altered states of consciousness on cue,

3668
01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:04.810
you know,

3669
01:50:04.810 --> 01:50:06.520
and then get them to compare notes,

3670
01:50:06.521 --> 01:50:08.440
get them to ask questions of those entities,

3671
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:09.970
see if any new information,

3672
01:50:09.971 --> 01:50:12.970
any novel information comes back that couldn't possibly have been known.

3673
01:50:13.390 --> 01:50:13.840
You know,

3674
01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:15.370
that that kind of thing is being done.

3675
01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:17.740
Interestingly with near death research,

3676
01:50:17.770 --> 01:50:18.440
um,

3677
01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:18.660
uh,

3678
01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:18.911
there,

3679
01:50:18.911 --> 01:50:19.301
there is,

3680
01:50:19.301 --> 01:50:19.571
you know,

3681
01:50:19.571 --> 01:50:22.990
there's another area where most materialist mainstream scientists,

3682
01:50:22.991 --> 01:50:24.160
we'll say nonsense,

3683
01:50:24.161 --> 01:50:27.520
there's no possibility of any kind of survival of death,

3684
01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:32.350
but people report these astonishing near death experiences and they report a

3685
01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:34.690
seeing things that they should not have been able to see.

3686
01:50:34.691 --> 01:50:36.250
So now in operating theaters,

3687
01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:37.780
in emergency rooms,

3688
01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:38.410
uh,

3689
01:50:38.410 --> 01:50:40.600
in a number of hospitals in London,

3690
01:50:40.890 --> 01:50:41.140
uh,

3691
01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:43.450
but also I believe in the United States as well,

3692
01:50:43.690 --> 01:50:47.770
they have created shelves up at a high level where they have placed certain

3693
01:50:47.771 --> 01:50:49.120
images and,

3694
01:50:49.121 --> 01:50:49.500
uh,

3695
01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:51.070
they are recording the data right now.

3696
01:50:51.071 --> 01:50:54.490
When people have a near death experience and they have had the sense of leaving

3697
01:50:54.491 --> 01:50:56.500
their bodies and being up around the ceiling.

3698
01:50:56.620 --> 01:50:57.760
Have they seen these images?

3699
01:50:57.790 --> 01:51:01.300
If they've seen those images and it can be documented scientifically,

3700
01:51:01.630 --> 01:51:02.351
then you know,

3701
01:51:02.351 --> 01:51:03.820
we have to think again about consciousness.

3702
01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:07.330
<v 5>So they're putting the images up there specifically to catch people looking.</v>

3703
01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:08.373
Yeah.

3704
01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:09.530
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

3705
01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:10.880
So when the guy comes back,

3706
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:15.500
when he flat lines and he's considered to be brain dead and they bring him back

3707
01:51:15.501 --> 01:51:16.160
to life,

3708
01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:19.280
this is happening more and more with advanced resuscitation techniques.

3709
01:51:19.490 --> 01:51:22.850
Many of them report having experiences out of their body.

3710
01:51:22.851 --> 01:51:24.830
Well now here's a scientific way to test that.

3711
01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:27.140
Is that imagination or is there something real going on

3712
01:51:27.190 --> 01:51:28.360
<v 5>and what's the data so far,</v>

3713
01:51:28.361 --> 01:51:30.300
if people seen those images of they had,

3714
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:30.770
there's some,

3715
01:51:30.770 --> 01:51:31.380
there's some

3716
01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:32.760
<v 4>quite compelling,</v>

3717
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:34.530
there's some quite compelling data,

3718
01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:37.440
but there's an elusive nature to the phenomenon,

3719
01:51:37.890 --> 01:51:41.700
which is that very often when somebody has a near death experience,

3720
01:51:41.701 --> 01:51:42.750
they've had it in the vault,

3721
01:51:42.810 --> 01:51:45.570
the one theater that didn't have the images on view.

3722
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:46.703
So they're looking,

3723
01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:48.660
they're looking for a convenient,

3724
01:51:48.661 --> 01:51:49.494
how convenient.

3725
01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:51.000
They're looking for a way round this,

3726
01:51:51.001 --> 01:51:54.420
which might involve using a like iPad devices,

3727
01:51:54.421 --> 01:51:58.890
which can be moved around very rapidly and placed in certain certain spots

3728
01:51:59.330 --> 01:52:02.090
<v 5>where the resuscitating resuscitating people,</v>

3729
01:52:02.170 --> 01:52:02.990
I don't think,

3730
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.260
see,

3731
01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:04.640
I think this is part of the issue.

3732
01:52:04.670 --> 01:52:05.210
You know,

3733
01:52:05.210 --> 01:52:08.000
when we say why doesn't science do this?

3734
01:52:08.001 --> 01:52:09.260
Or what if science did that?

3735
01:52:09.261 --> 01:52:10.550
I really don't think it's science.

3736
01:52:10.551 --> 01:52:14.930
I think science and the scientific method are awesome and very hugely important.

3737
01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:16.040
I think it's people.

3738
01:52:16.190 --> 01:52:16.520
Yeah.

3739
01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:17.960
I think the issue is people,

3740
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:19.040
it's personalities.

3741
01:52:19.041 --> 01:52:21.080
It's people's style of communication.

3742
01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:25.970
It's people's styles of interaction and there the sense of competition that they

3743
01:52:25.971 --> 01:52:29.570
have with exchanging ideas and with exploring ideas.

3744
01:52:29.571 --> 01:52:29.870
Yeah.

3745
01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:33.410
It's a massive amount of competition involved in being intellectually correct.

3746
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.830
Yeah.

3747
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:34.760
Getting those points,

3748
01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:36.050
the points for being correct,

3749
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.640
right.

3750
01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:38.990
It's a competition for them.

3751
01:52:38.991 --> 01:52:39.261
I mean,

3752
01:52:39.261 --> 01:52:39.411
I,

3753
01:52:39.411 --> 01:52:40.970
I've seen it on my message board.

3754
01:52:40.971 --> 01:52:42.290
I've seen on reddit there's,

3755
01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:43.490
when you're writing something,

3756
01:52:43.491 --> 01:52:45.080
you're not just writing something.

3757
01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:49.250
Also sort of expressing yourself in a way that you would like to get Brownie

3758
01:52:49.251 --> 01:52:51.350
points for that you would like to be powerful.

3759
01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:52.461
<v 3>Good name,</v>

3760
01:52:52.461 --> 01:52:53.770
mapping it to what you say.

3761
01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:54.550
Right.

3762
01:52:54.550 --> 01:52:55.120
We would like,

3763
01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:56.680
you would like people we all want to be like,

3764
01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:59.160
<v 5>so when people go to battle about ideas,</v>

3765
01:52:59.190 --> 01:53:00.840
the real issue is ego.

3766
01:53:00.841 --> 01:53:01.501
It's humans.

3767
01:53:01.501 --> 01:53:02.950
It's not the scientific method,

3768
01:53:03.330 --> 01:53:06.780
which the scientific method should most certainly be applied to psychedelics.

3769
01:53:06.781 --> 01:53:11.550
It should most certainly be applied to every aspect of the known world.

3770
01:53:11.551 --> 01:53:11.760
Yeah.

3771
01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:12.330
Yeah.

3772
01:53:12.330 --> 01:53:17.330
And in fact if that was the case then more people would probably do psychedelics

3773
01:53:17.461 --> 01:53:19.170
and we'd have less of an issue in the first place.

3774
01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:20.430
I would rather,

3775
01:53:20.430 --> 01:53:21.330
I would rather think so.

3776
01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:22.391
So you're,

3777
01:53:22.391 --> 01:53:24.030
you're not an anti science guy,

3778
01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:25.620
you just an anti asshole guy.

3779
01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:26.761
Thank you.

3780
01:53:26.761 --> 01:53:28.020
That's a good way to put it,

3781
01:53:28.850 --> 01:53:29.610
I think.

3782
01:53:29.610 --> 01:53:33.930
But there's a label that people like to throw on you that you are anti

3783
01:53:33.931 --> 01:53:38.040
scientific and I think that's one of the ways that this ted thing built momentum

3784
01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:39.480
and when,

3785
01:53:39.481 --> 01:53:39.550
yeah,

3786
01:53:39.550 --> 01:53:39.970
<v 3>they do,</v>

3787
01:53:39.970 --> 01:53:41.530
they do like to throw that label.

3788
01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:42.401
As a matter of fact,

3789
01:53:42.401 --> 01:53:43.234
pseudoscience.

3790
01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:44.530
As a matter of fact,

3791
01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:49.560
it's one of the reasons amongst many why I started to write fiction as well as

3792
01:53:50.111 --> 01:53:50.944
nonfiction.

3793
01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:56.380
Because if I explore extraordinary ideas in the realm of fiction,

3794
01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:00.460
I'm not actually then making a claim that this is fact.

3795
01:54:00.970 --> 01:54:01.930
Nevertheless,

3796
01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:05.290
the ideas are there to be explored in what,

3797
01:54:05.291 --> 01:54:06.124
in what I've written.

3798
01:54:06.430 --> 01:54:07.720
So it becomes,

3799
01:54:07.721 --> 01:54:12.520
it becomes possible to enter into an inquiry,

3800
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:17.790
into the nature of reality without having to create this huge superstructure of

3801
01:54:18.251 --> 01:54:19.084
defense,

3802
01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:19.691
uh,

3803
01:54:19.691 --> 01:54:21.730
against attacks by,

3804
01:54:21.790 --> 01:54:22.660
by scientists.

3805
01:54:22.690 --> 01:54:26.170
And I think it's a very useful way forward as far as,

3806
01:54:26.171 --> 01:54:27.250
as far as I'm concerned,

3807
01:54:27.251 --> 01:54:29.440
because I did find that writing,

3808
01:54:29.650 --> 01:54:30.430
um,

3809
01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:31.990
the writing nonfiction,

3810
01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:33.100
uh,

3811
01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:38.100
more and more because I've become this target figure for scientists required me

3812
01:54:39.881 --> 01:54:43.270
to bulletproof my arguments in ways that make them,

3813
01:54:43.271 --> 01:54:43.661
frankly,

3814
01:54:43.661 --> 01:54:44.830
a bit boring to read,

3815
01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:45.580
you know?

3816
01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:46.030
And,

3817
01:54:46.030 --> 01:54:46.660
and I'm,

3818
01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:48.940
I quite like the liberation of not having to do that.

3819
01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:50.080
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

3820
01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:50.771
I agree.

3821
01:54:50.771 --> 01:54:52.180
I think your,

3822
01:54:52.210 --> 01:54:55.300
your ideas are always very novel and you're very interesting dude.

3823
01:54:55.301 --> 01:54:58.600
But I think in a lot of ways you're sort of a barred,

3824
01:54:58.960 --> 01:54:59.440
you know,

3825
01:54:59.440 --> 01:54:59.691
you,

3826
01:54:59.691 --> 01:55:03.670
you're a great storyteller and you're an exciter of the imagination and in

3827
01:55:03.690 --> 01:55:05.320
inspire of questions.

3828
01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:05.710
Thank you.

3829
01:55:05.710 --> 01:55:06.970
I feel that's what I'm supposed to do.

3830
01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.320
That's what you do best man.

3831
01:55:08.321 --> 01:55:08.891
That book,

3832
01:55:08.891 --> 01:55:13.480
fingerprints of the Gods got me looking at so many different aspects of our

3833
01:55:13.481 --> 01:55:16.900
culture and then questioning how we got to this point in the first place.

3834
01:55:16.901 --> 01:55:18.490
How it is that I get up in the morning,

3835
01:55:18.491 --> 01:55:21.550
I get in my car and I drive to work as it was doing this after reading your

3836
01:55:21.551 --> 01:55:21.791
book,

3837
01:55:21.791 --> 01:55:26.140
I was thinking how strange it is that we live in this society where I was born

3838
01:55:26.141 --> 01:55:27.340
in 1967.

3839
01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:27.730
Um,

3840
01:55:27.730 --> 01:55:28.330
I was,

3841
01:55:28.330 --> 01:55:28.601
you know,

3842
01:55:28.601 --> 01:55:29.351
we've this,

3843
01:55:29.351 --> 01:55:31.390
the cities have been here since I was a baby.

3844
01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:32.590
Cars had been here.

3845
01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:34.090
I have assumed that they've always been here.

3846
01:55:34.091 --> 01:55:38.290
But then when you really stop and think about what a short period of time,

3847
01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:41.530
2,500 BC is or what a short period of time,

3848
01:55:41.531 --> 01:55:43.350
even 30,000 BC is.

3849
01:55:43.351 --> 01:55:43.690
Yeah.

3850
01:55:43.690 --> 01:55:43.840
Well,

3851
01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:46.260
that's nothing man in the history of the world.

3852
01:55:46.261 --> 01:55:47.760
It's all a a blink.

3853
01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:48.030
Yes,

3854
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:48.863
it's a nothing.

3855
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:51.030
And we are in the middle of this.

3856
01:55:51.031 --> 01:55:51.864
We wake up,

3857
01:55:52.060 --> 01:55:55.230
it being born is like waking up in the middle of a trip.

3858
01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:56.303
Like where are we?

3859
01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:57.173
Where are we going?

3860
01:55:57.300 --> 01:55:59.340
And that's the entire collective culture.

3861
01:55:59.341 --> 01:56:02.610
And that was really probably the first time I've ever really considered that was

3862
01:56:02.611 --> 01:56:03.444
in reading your book.

3863
01:56:03.660 --> 01:56:06.300
And that made me so excited about history.

3864
01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:08.400
I wasn't excited about history from school.

3865
01:56:08.401 --> 01:56:08.611
I mean,

3866
01:56:08.611 --> 01:56:10.050
I took the obligatory classes,

3867
01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:11.450
<v 3>glad to have had that,</v>

3868
01:56:11.590 --> 01:56:12.590
to have had that effect.

3869
01:56:12.591 --> 01:56:13.670
And it makes me feel good as,

3870
01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:15.140
as I'm getting on in life.

3871
01:56:15.141 --> 01:56:17.500
One of the things that makes me feel good is this,

3872
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:20.240
the feedback that I do get from people who've read my books,

3873
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:22.880
which I've sweated blood in order to,

3874
01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:23.570
to write.

3875
01:56:23.570 --> 01:56:24.920
And I've taken a lot of,

3876
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:25.221
uh,

3877
01:56:25.221 --> 01:56:26.000
attacks,

3878
01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:26.270
uh,

3879
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:26.841
from doing that.

3880
01:56:26.841 --> 01:56:28.880
But I find this the new thing for me.

3881
01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:29.870
Um,

3882
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:30.231
you know,

3883
01:56:30.231 --> 01:56:31.040
Facebook,

3884
01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:31.541
I mean I,

3885
01:56:31.541 --> 01:56:33.200
I'm a novice at Facebook,

3886
01:56:33.201 --> 01:56:37.940
but I've started to interact really quite strongly on my Facebook pages.

3887
01:56:37.941 --> 01:56:40.010
I enjoy the interaction that I get there.

3888
01:56:40.011 --> 01:56:40.844
I enjoy,

3889
01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:41.370
uh,

3890
01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:43.260
the new ideas that are put to me by,

3891
01:56:43.290 --> 01:56:44.020
by others.

3892
01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:44.330
Um,

3893
01:56:44.330 --> 01:56:44.871
and uh,

3894
01:56:44.871 --> 01:56:45.141
yeah.

3895
01:56:45.141 --> 01:56:45.181
Uh,

3896
01:56:45.181 --> 01:56:45.561
frankly,

3897
01:56:45.561 --> 01:56:46.580
it's really nice when,

3898
01:56:46.581 --> 01:56:47.241
when some,

3899
01:56:47.241 --> 01:56:48.440
some kid in his 20s,

3900
01:56:48.441 --> 01:56:51.230
right writes to me and says he red fingerprints of the gods and it changed the

3901
01:56:51.231 --> 01:56:52.910
way that he looks at the world.

3902
01:56:52.911 --> 01:56:53.070
I've,

3903
01:56:53.070 --> 01:56:53.310
that,

3904
01:56:53.310 --> 01:56:54.800
that makes me feel I've done something.

3905
01:56:54.801 --> 01:56:55.940
I've done something,

3906
01:56:55.941 --> 01:56:56.271
right.

3907
01:56:56.271 --> 01:56:56.960
Anyway,

3908
01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:58.790
in all the mistakes I may have made,

3909
01:56:58.791 --> 01:56:59.360
I've done,

3910
01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:00.410
I've done something

3911
01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:01.381
<v 5>you've done quite a bit,</v>

3912
01:57:01.381 --> 01:57:01.620
right?

3913
01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:03.300
But one of the things I think that you,

3914
01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:03.640
you,

3915
01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:06.750
you haven't done yet that you could totally be amazing at is do your own

3916
01:57:06.751 --> 01:57:07.584
podcast.

3917
01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:08.940
You're a windup guy.

3918
01:57:08.941 --> 01:57:09.860
I can press you,

3919
01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:11.220
I can start you up.

3920
01:57:11.250 --> 01:57:11.651
Tell what,

3921
01:57:11.651 --> 01:57:11.801
what,

3922
01:57:11.801 --> 01:57:13.140
what's this Iowasca stuff?

3923
01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:13.591
Bang,

3924
01:57:13.591 --> 01:57:14.331
press play.

3925
01:57:14.331 --> 01:57:16.370
And you will,

3926
01:57:16.410 --> 01:57:17.540
you will do the dance and,

3927
01:57:17.541 --> 01:57:22.541
and captivate with amazing descriptions and this very,

3928
01:57:22.691 --> 01:57:22.780
uh,

3929
01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:23.040
in,

3930
01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:26.070
in trancing and way of communicating.

3931
01:57:26.071 --> 01:57:26.690
Interesting.

3932
01:57:26.690 --> 01:57:28.310
I think that's the,

3933
01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:32.130
the people like that are really important in culture and most scientists are

3934
01:57:32.131 --> 01:57:33.060
boring as fuck.

3935
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:35.490
And even though they're doing amazing work and it's,

3936
01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:38.850
we wouldn't be communicating if it wasn't for some boring scientist.

3937
01:57:39.090 --> 01:57:42.900
The reality is you're not going to excite people with that shitty personality of

3938
01:57:42.901 --> 01:57:43.500
yours.

3939
01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:43.940
Yeah.

3940
01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:44.280
Yeah.

3941
01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:45.360
And it's not all of them.

3942
01:57:45.390 --> 01:57:46.051
Let me find one.

3943
01:57:46.051 --> 01:57:48.420
Was legendarily charismatic,

3944
01:57:48.450 --> 01:57:50.220
there's some great guys crossing again,

3945
01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:50.640
you know,

3946
01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:53.220
Neil degrasse Tyson is brilliant in that regard.

3947
01:57:53.221 --> 01:57:53.591
He's a,

3948
01:57:53.591 --> 01:57:55.940
he's a brilliant man and he's brilliant,

3949
01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:59.790
is captivating and entertaining and he draws you in and they're very important

3950
01:57:59.791 --> 01:58:00.211
as well,

3951
01:58:00.211 --> 01:58:01.044
are important as well.

3952
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:02.370
There's a lot of,

3953
01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:03.233
uh,

3954
01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:04.300
<v 3>well I will look at the,</v>

3955
01:58:04.301 --> 01:58:05.090
um,

3956
01:58:05.090 --> 01:58:06.830
<v 5>podcast my friend</v>

3957
01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:09.930
<v 3>now that I have now that I've kind of initiated myself into the Internet world</v>

3958
01:58:09.931 --> 01:58:13.140
and got talking to people on Facebook and so on and my website,

3959
01:58:13.141 --> 01:58:13.531
you know,

3960
01:58:13.531 --> 01:58:14.950
all of these things our way.

3961
01:58:15.050 --> 01:58:16.200
And the one thing I haven't done,

3962
01:58:16.201 --> 01:58:17.280
I do have a youtube channel,

3963
01:58:17.281 --> 01:58:18.600
but what I don't have is,

3964
01:58:18.601 --> 01:58:18.930
uh,

3965
01:58:18.930 --> 01:58:19.171
is,

3966
01:58:19.171 --> 01:58:19.431
is,

3967
01:58:19.431 --> 01:58:19.681
is,

3968
01:58:19.681 --> 01:58:19.800
uh,

3969
01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:21.150
is a podcast and it might be some

3970
01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:22.570
<v 5>massively important,</v>

3971
01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:26.410
it's the best way to communicate with people because even in writing,

3972
01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:29.590
sometimes things are lost in tone and tone.

3973
01:58:29.591 --> 01:58:32.490
And the way you can be sarcastic and just joking around,

3974
01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:33.400
you actually have to write it.

3975
01:58:33.401 --> 01:58:34.031
Just kidding.

3976
01:58:34.031 --> 01:58:34.301
You know,

3977
01:58:34.301 --> 01:58:36.140
you have to actually quantify it.

3978
01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:39.340
Whereas people know in the inflection of your voice,

3979
01:58:39.341 --> 01:58:40.330
the look on your face.

3980
01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:41.390
That's why we'd like do this.

3981
01:58:41.391 --> 01:58:42.070
You,

3982
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:44.350
even though most of the people listen to this podcast,

3983
01:58:44.590 --> 01:58:48.160
we like to have an iTunes version so you could see sometimes we're making silly

3984
01:58:48.161 --> 01:58:49.390
faces were joking around.

3985
01:58:49.930 --> 01:58:50.650
Um,

3986
01:58:50.650 --> 01:58:55.450
I think for you it would be an excellent way to explore new ideas,

3987
01:58:55.570 --> 01:58:59.710
the things that come to you and also respond to people online instead of like

3988
01:58:59.711 --> 01:59:01.330
sitting down and writing everything out.

3989
01:59:01.630 --> 01:59:04.540
Pick a few emails every week and respond to them.

3990
01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:05.573
And

3991
01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:07.680
I will take your advice.

3992
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:08.141
Perfect.

3993
01:59:08.141 --> 01:59:08.974
For you,

3994
01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:14.340
what was the argument against Rupert Sheldrake from what I've read online was a

3995
01:59:14.441 --> 01:59:17.050
bit stronger than the argument for you?

3996
01:59:17.150 --> 01:59:17.331
<v 4>No,</v>

3997
01:59:17.331 --> 01:59:18.164
I don't think so.

3998
01:59:18.170 --> 01:59:18.480
Again,

3999
01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:20.420
they attributed statements to him that he didn't make,

4000
01:59:20.450 --> 01:59:22.910
so it was more of the same type of same type of thing.

4001
01:59:22.911 --> 01:59:23.270
He,

4002
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.700
he,

4003
01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:24.090
his,

4004
01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:24.590
his,

4005
01:59:24.590 --> 01:59:24.800
uh,

4006
01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:25.580
controversial,

4007
01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:25.791
well,

4008
01:59:25.791 --> 01:59:30.791
he's saying that that scientist science is locked in what we call a materialist

4009
01:59:31.071 --> 01:59:31.881
reference frame,

4010
01:59:31.881 --> 01:59:36.200
which is that it seeks to reduce everything to matter and that there cannot be.

4011
01:59:36.201 --> 01:59:37.100
And so therefore,

4012
01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:38.720
the idea of telepathy,

4013
01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:39.920
for example,

4014
01:59:40.370 --> 01:59:44.450
is an impossible idea as far as mainstream science is concerned.

4015
01:59:44.451 --> 01:59:48.710
Because if your consciousness is simply something that's generated by your brain

4016
01:59:48.711 --> 01:59:48.891
way,

4017
01:59:48.891 --> 01:59:51.410
how can you then pick up the thoughts of somebody else,

4018
01:59:51.650 --> 01:59:52.220
you know,

4019
01:59:52.220 --> 01:59:53.590
across a continent or,

4020
01:59:53.591 --> 01:59:55.070
or on the other side of the world.

4021
01:59:55.071 --> 01:59:55.581
How is that,

4022
01:59:55.581 --> 01:59:56.600
how is that possible?

4023
01:59:56.900 --> 01:59:57.640
Um,

4024
01:59:57.640 --> 01:59:57.951
and,

4025
01:59:57.951 --> 01:59:58.401
and,

4026
01:59:58.401 --> 01:59:58.790
uh,

4027
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:59.421
so he,

4028
01:59:59.421 --> 01:59:59.781
he was,

4029
01:59:59.781 --> 02:00:03.830
he is questioning the materialist reference frame of mainstream science.

4030
02:00:03.831 --> 02:00:08.710
And since the most vocal advocates of mainstream science are materialists who do

4031
02:00:08.711 --> 02:00:08.780
it,

4032
02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:13.250
they do believe that consciousness is an accidental epi phenomenon of brain

4033
02:00:13.251 --> 02:00:14.084
activity.

4034
02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:15.080
That there is nothing,

4035
02:00:15.110 --> 02:00:18.500
there is nothing else to it than that he got under a lot of skin.

4036
02:00:18.670 --> 02:00:18.821
<v 5>Well,</v>

4037
02:00:18.821 --> 02:00:20.860
there's also the one that don't believe that.

4038
02:00:20.861 --> 02:00:23.050
And having clearly defined what consciousness is,

4039
02:00:23.051 --> 02:00:27.160
but say if psychic abilities do exist,

4040
02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:29.000
<v 4>show them yeah.</v>

4041
02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:30.233
Exhibit them.

4042
02:00:30.270 --> 02:00:30.421
Well,

4043
02:00:30.421 --> 02:00:32.040
that's precisely what [inaudible] has done.

4044
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:32.810
Okay.

4045
02:00:32.810 --> 02:00:33.130
Yes.

4046
02:00:33.130 --> 02:00:35.430
But what has he done clearly that shows,

4047
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.940
um,

4048
02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:36.660
in your opinion?

4049
02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:37.493
Well,

4050
02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:37.920
for,

4051
02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:38.940
for example,

4052
02:00:38.970 --> 02:00:39.510
um,

4053
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:42.250
documenting the sense of being stared at that people,

4054
02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:46.590
people know when they're being right and he's done experiments which document

4055
02:00:46.591 --> 02:00:50.790
this and prove it at a level of statistical significance.

4056
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.840
Got a couple of percent,

4057
02:00:51.841 --> 02:00:52.300
right.

4058
02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:53.250
Couple of percent.

4059
02:00:54.270 --> 02:00:56.400
Why does your dog know when you're coming home?

4060
02:00:56.480 --> 02:00:57.960
Has that been disproven ever?

4061
02:00:58.130 --> 02:00:58.680
No.

4062
02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:02.340
Even though the owner of the dog varies,

4063
02:01:02.341 --> 02:01:06.420
the root comes home by a different route in a different way.

4064
02:01:06.810 --> 02:01:07.430
Um,

4065
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:08.400
everything might be your wife.

4066
02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:08.770
Yeah,

4067
02:01:08.770 --> 02:01:10.130
that's probably [inaudible].

4068
02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:11.873
Hello?

4069
02:01:14.110 --> 02:01:14.640
<v 6>Oh,</v>

4070
02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:15.473
it's your neighbor.

4071
02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:17.561
<v 5>Oh yeah,</v>

4072
02:01:17.561 --> 02:01:18.160
she's here.

4073
02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:18.670
Okay.

4074
02:01:18.670 --> 02:01:20.380
We'll have someone come out and get it right now.

4075
02:01:20.410 --> 02:01:21.370
Thank you very much.

4076
02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:22.631
All right,

4077
02:01:22.631 --> 02:01:22.961
Jamie,

4078
02:01:22.961 --> 02:01:24.940
just go out and tell her we'll wrap this up.

4079
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:26.263
That's our neighbor.

4080
02:01:26.270 --> 02:01:26.740
Yeah.

4081
02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:28.150
She must've been knocking on the door.

4082
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:29.090
The great

4083
02:01:29.090 --> 02:01:30.620
<v 4>thing about a live,</v>

4084
02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:31.820
a live discussion.

4085
02:01:32.090 --> 02:01:32.930
It's beautiful.

4086
02:01:35.010 --> 02:01:37.430
Ted's up at the door and she's,

4087
02:01:37.431 --> 02:01:38.360
she's got a telephone.

4088
02:01:38.890 --> 02:01:39.950
It's cool because people

4089
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:41.480
<v 1>know that it's not some etiquette,</v>

4090
02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:42.201
you know,

4091
02:01:42.201 --> 02:01:42.530
uh,

4092
02:01:42.530 --> 02:01:44.750
it's not edited and polished.

4093
02:01:44.751 --> 02:01:44.991
It's a,

4094
02:01:44.991 --> 02:01:46.130
it's a real conversation.

4095
02:01:46.131 --> 02:01:46.960
And that way,

4096
02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:47.241
you know,

4097
02:01:47.241 --> 02:01:49.730
like we couldn't have this conversation afterwards and he'd say,

4098
02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:49.911
ah,

4099
02:01:49.911 --> 02:01:50.151
you know,

4100
02:01:50.151 --> 02:01:51.050
the thing about science,

4101
02:01:51.051 --> 02:01:52.280
maybe I said something,

4102
02:01:52.281 --> 02:01:52.701
could we,

4103
02:01:52.701 --> 02:01:53.600
could we cut that out?

4104
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:54.660
No,

4105
02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:55.450
it's role.

4106
02:01:55.450 --> 02:01:57.220
<v 4>It's real and uh,</v>

4107
02:01:57.440 --> 02:01:57.820
and,

4108
02:01:57.820 --> 02:01:58.160
and,

4109
02:01:58.160 --> 02:01:58.690
and,

4110
02:01:58.690 --> 02:01:59.523
and it works.

4111
02:01:59.740 --> 02:02:00.460
Um,

4112
02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:01.060
can I,

4113
02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:03.400
can I say a couple of things which I would like people to hear?

4114
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.970
Sure.

4115
02:02:03.970 --> 02:02:04.800
One is,

4116
02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:05.633
um,

4117
02:02:06.010 --> 02:02:06.900
I this,

4118
02:02:06.901 --> 02:02:09.070
this is an odd thing to ask because I've been very,

4119
02:02:09.071 --> 02:02:11.830
I've been very successful as a nonfiction author,

4120
02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:12.430
but,

4121
02:02:12.430 --> 02:02:17.430
but I am hoping that people will pay attention to my fiction and that people

4122
02:02:17.921 --> 02:02:19.000
will listen to my fiction.

4123
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.631
It's very,

4124
02:02:19.631 --> 02:02:23.530
very difficult for me to be published as a novelist.

4125
02:02:23.531 --> 02:02:28.531
The publishing industry want me to stay in my box as a successful nonfiction

4126
02:02:29.531 --> 02:02:33.460
author and they don't want me to explore the fictional side of things.

4127
02:02:33.461 --> 02:02:36.070
So I've managed to get a British publisher for my novel,

4128
02:02:36.370 --> 02:02:37.480
which we talked about earlier,

4129
02:02:37.481 --> 02:02:37.931
War God,

4130
02:02:37.931 --> 02:02:39.610
about the Spanish conquest of Mexico.

4131
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:44.910
But so far I don't have an American publisher and I have been helped a lot by my

4132
02:02:45.521 --> 02:02:46.630
Facebook community,

4133
02:02:46.750 --> 02:02:51.750
many of whom are Americans who have gone to Amazon UK and bought the British

4134
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:54.760
edition of my book.

4135
02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:59.740
I'm from America and it will be delivered to them here in America,

4136
02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:00.280
uh,

4137
02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:03.250
in a few days because the book is published on the 30th of May.

4138
02:03:03.850 --> 02:03:05.980
And if anybody's interested in that story,

4139
02:03:05.981 --> 02:03:09.010
I would appreciate if they'd make the effort to go to Amazon UK and pick up the

4140
02:03:09.011 --> 02:03:09.161
book.

4141
02:03:09.161 --> 02:03:13.210
Because what that does then is it gives the book the possibility of some success

4142
02:03:13.211 --> 02:03:15.490
in Britain and if it succeeds in Britain,

4143
02:03:15.790 --> 02:03:19.210
then it will be picked up by an American publisher.

4144
02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:21.940
The resistance is just that it's nonfiction.

4145
02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:22.660
Yeah,

4146
02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:23.260
that's right.

4147
02:03:23.260 --> 02:03:23.690
Publishing,

4148
02:03:23.690 --> 02:03:26.710
publishing industries and industry that thinks in terms of brands,

4149
02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:29.650
and I am branded as a nonfiction author.

4150
02:03:29.710 --> 02:03:31.390
This is your second [inaudible] is my second.

4151
02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:32.233
There's a second.

4152
02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:36.190
So when I first novel vanished without a trace because it had,

4153
02:03:36.191 --> 02:03:40.250
that was called entangled because it had absolutely no support from,

4154
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:41.560
from the publishers at all.

4155
02:03:41.561 --> 02:03:42.820
It's sold a few thousand copies.

4156
02:03:42.821 --> 02:03:43.551
But really it was,

4157
02:03:43.551 --> 02:03:44.770
it was completely ignored.

4158
02:03:45.220 --> 02:03:47.620
And the same thing is going to happen with,

4159
02:03:47.621 --> 02:03:47.890
uh,

4160
02:03:47.890 --> 02:03:49.240
with war God as well.

4161
02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:50.020
Um,

4162
02:03:50.020 --> 02:03:50.311
and,

4163
02:03:50.311 --> 02:03:51.570
and less if people find it.

4164
02:03:51.571 --> 02:03:53.860
And now what I've done is I've put free chapters,

4165
02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:58.460
free to read chapters online on my website and be very as Graham hancock.com.

4166
02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:00.910
That's www dot Graham Hancock dot.

4167
02:04:00.911 --> 02:04:01.220
Yeah,

4168
02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:02.200
<v 1>we've got to fix her Twitter,</v>

4169
02:04:02.210 --> 02:04:03.043
man.

4170
02:04:03.230 --> 02:04:05.360
Double underscore is confusing,

4171
02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:06.600
but I can't,

4172
02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:07.910
I couldn't get that name.

4173
02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:09.740
I couldn't get at Graham Hancock.

4174
02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:10.790
I got at Graham.

4175
02:04:10.810 --> 02:04:11.900
Who's Graham Hancock?

4176
02:04:11.901 --> 02:04:13.100
Who's the at Graham Hancock?

4177
02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:13.371
Well,

4178
02:04:13.371 --> 02:04:15.920
there's another guy with my name and his name is Graham Hancock.

4179
02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:16.840
His name is Greg [inaudible].

4180
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:17.691
He got it first.

4181
02:04:17.691 --> 02:04:18.560
So nothing can be,

4182
02:04:18.561 --> 02:04:20.090
not just a double underscore.

4183
02:04:20.210 --> 02:04:24.170
Couldn't you just do something else like Graham Hancock in one word?

4184
02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:25.380
No,

4185
02:04:25.380 --> 02:04:26.240
that's what he's got.

4186
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.990
He's got it.

4187
02:04:26.990 --> 02:04:27.590
Oh,

4188
02:04:27.590 --> 02:04:28.490
well how about,

4189
02:04:28.491 --> 02:04:29.324
uh,

4190
02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:30.973
did you have a middle name?

4191
02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:32.520
Gray and brief sign code?

4192
02:04:32.810 --> 02:04:33.800
Granby Hancock.

4193
02:04:33.801 --> 02:04:34.320
Yeah.

4194
02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:34.500
Well,

4195
02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:35.300
how about that?

4196
02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:35.511
No,

4197
02:04:35.511 --> 02:04:36.320
that's stupid.

4198
02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:36.680
Yeah,

4199
02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:37.260
I forgot it.

4200
02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:38.093
I forgot what I was saying.

4201
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:39.040
Yeah.

4202
02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:39.420
You know,

4203
02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:40.140
my,

4204
02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:40.441
my,

4205
02:04:40.441 --> 02:04:44.700
my mother bless her when she gave me my name [inaudible] she had him.

4206
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:46.980
So my initials are [inaudible] Hancock.

4207
02:04:46.981 --> 02:04:47.370
Okay.

4208
02:04:47.370 --> 02:04:48.660
Right when she gave me my name,

4209
02:04:48.661 --> 02:04:49.230
she,

4210
02:04:49.230 --> 02:04:50.460
she was thinking of yeah.

4211
02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:50.640
That,

4212
02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:50.831
that's,

4213
02:04:50.831 --> 02:04:52.320
that's what I use on my email address.

4214
02:04:52.321 --> 02:04:53.610
She was thinking about you fucked up,

4215
02:04:53.611 --> 02:04:55.980
someone's going to hit you with email and hit me with emails anyway.

4216
02:04:55.981 --> 02:04:56.670
It's okay.

4217
02:04:56.670 --> 02:05:00.540
She was thinking in a rather grandiose way of George Bernard Shaw,

4218
02:05:00.570 --> 02:05:01.360
you know,

4219
02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:01.980
Gb.

4220
02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:02.460
Oh.

4221
02:05:02.460 --> 02:05:06.630
So she called me Gb hung and not realizing that Gbh also stands for grievous

4222
02:05:06.631 --> 02:05:07.411
bodily harm,

4223
02:05:07.411 --> 02:05:08.000
you know.

4224
02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:08.210
Oh,

4225
02:05:08.210 --> 02:05:08.640
it does.

4226
02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:09.900
In Briston in British law.

4227
02:05:09.901 --> 02:05:10.230
Yeah.

4228
02:05:10.230 --> 02:05:10.651
That's a,

4229
02:05:10.651 --> 02:05:11.670
that's a particular,

4230
02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:13.890
that's a particular crime.

4231
02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:14.231
You know,

4232
02:05:14.231 --> 02:05:17.330
that you've committed an act of grievance of Gbh somebody.

4233
02:05:17.610 --> 02:05:18.480
So that's my,

4234
02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:18.810
that's,

4235
02:05:18.810 --> 02:05:19.830
that's my initials.

4236
02:05:20.130 --> 02:05:21.480
I don't know what to,

4237
02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:21.990
um,

4238
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:23.370
what to do about my Twitter name.

4239
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:25.850
Maybe we'll just have to keep it stable and just double underscore this is,

4240
02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:26.693
so there's an underscore.

4241
02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:29.820
Can I introduce my Sottha?

4242
02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:30.121
Sure.

4243
02:05:30.121 --> 02:05:30.954
If she wants to stop,

4244
02:05:31.050 --> 02:05:31.883
come here.

4245
02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:33.113
Hi Samantha.

4246
02:05:33.330 --> 02:05:34.080
Hi.

4247
02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:34.620
What's up?

4248
02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:34.870
Okay.

4249
02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:35.670
Okay.

4250
02:05:35.670 --> 02:05:37.250
He's all so happy now that he quit.

4251
02:05:37.251 --> 02:05:37.471
Quit.

4252
02:05:37.471 --> 02:05:39.840
We'd look at them completely.

4253
02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:40.680
Yes.

4254
02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:41.513
Are you happier?

4255
02:05:41.550 --> 02:05:42.610
Nobody quit weekly.

4256
02:05:42.750 --> 02:05:43.410
Wow.

4257
02:05:43.410 --> 02:05:44.243
Thank God.

4258
02:05:45.870 --> 02:05:46.830
That's hilarious.

4259
02:05:47.010 --> 02:05:47.420
Yeah.

4260
02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:47.570
No,

4261
02:05:47.570 --> 02:05:50.300
because it's simply because he was abusing this sounds right.

4262
02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:51.480
It is.

4263
02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:51.751
Yeah.

4264
02:05:51.751 --> 02:05:52.400
I understand.

4265
02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:52.750
Yeah.

4266
02:05:52.750 --> 02:05:57.750
It was the substance controlling him being in control of him as opposed to him.

4267
02:05:57.980 --> 02:05:58.450
Yeah.

4268
02:05:58.450 --> 02:06:00.790
Shell of the substances.

4269
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:01.110
Yeah.

4270
02:06:01.110 --> 02:06:02.280
We went deep into it.

4271
02:06:02.550 --> 02:06:03.383
Yeah.

4272
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:04.440
It's interesting stuff.

4273
02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:05.430
Do you have this on?

4274
02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:05.990
Um,

4275
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.823
Kendall?

4276
02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:07.300
Uh,

4277
02:06:07.300 --> 02:06:07.781
yes,

4278
02:06:07.781 --> 02:06:10.780
but you have to buy it in England and I think there's some things that make it

4279
02:06:10.781 --> 02:06:12.850
difficult for Americans to buy the kindle edition.

4280
02:06:12.851 --> 02:06:13.571
They can only,

4281
02:06:13.571 --> 02:06:14.231
they can only buy,

4282
02:06:14.231 --> 02:06:15.180
they're the hard,

4283
02:06:15.230 --> 02:06:16.720
the hardback edition [inaudible] still.

4284
02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:17.350
But there's,

4285
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:21.700
there's links on my website which go to the right place to buy it and those

4286
02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:23.410
chapters to read so people can meet.

4287
02:06:23.410 --> 02:06:24.580
I'm not asking people to buy it.

4288
02:06:24.581 --> 02:06:26.290
Blind people can make up their own minds.

4289
02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:26.981
Read chapters.

4290
02:06:26.981 --> 02:06:27.550
If they hate it,

4291
02:06:27.550 --> 02:06:28.383
don't buy it.

4292
02:06:28.690 --> 02:06:29.351
Graham Hancock,

4293
02:06:29.351 --> 02:06:32.510
one of our sponsors is audible.com is audible.com.

4294
02:06:32.511 --> 02:06:32.620
Yeah.

4295
02:06:32.620 --> 02:06:33.201
Do you do?

4296
02:06:33.201 --> 02:06:34.230
You might not know.

4297
02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:38.740
The US edition of my first novel entangled is available on audible,

4298
02:06:38.770 --> 02:06:40.840
but right now I do not have,

4299
02:06:40.870 --> 02:06:41.703
did you read it?

4300
02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:42.220
Huh?

4301
02:06:42.220 --> 02:06:42.550
No,

4302
02:06:42.550 --> 02:06:43.000
I did it.

4303
02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:43.500
It was red,

4304
02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:44.710
but it was right by somebody else.

4305
02:06:44.711 --> 02:06:44.930
Yeah.

4306
02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:45.200
Yeah.

4307
02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:46.450
Do you like the person who read it?

4308
02:06:46.510 --> 02:06:47.110
Is it good?

4309
02:06:47.110 --> 02:06:50.770
It's gotta be weird or hearing someone read your words.

4310
02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:51.640
It's weird.

4311
02:06:51.670 --> 02:06:52.001
Um,

4312
02:06:52.001 --> 02:06:53.080
if they don't do it well,

4313
02:06:53.081 --> 02:06:54.310
but in this case it was done well.

4314
02:06:54.820 --> 02:06:55.390
Wow.

4315
02:06:55.390 --> 02:06:55.571
Yeah.

4316
02:06:55.571 --> 02:06:57.880
You don't want to buy a Stephen King's when he reads them.

4317
02:06:57.940 --> 02:06:58.660
That's the only,

4318
02:06:58.660 --> 02:06:59.800
if I were to give advice,

4319
02:06:59.830 --> 02:07:00.521
not had that plan.

4320
02:07:00.521 --> 02:07:01.810
I'm a huge Stephen King Fan.

4321
02:07:01.810 --> 02:07:03.610
Me toward the king is brilliant.

4322
02:07:03.630 --> 02:07:04.360
This is amazing.

4323
02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:06.860
His he and his book on writing is equally amazing.

4324
02:07:06.861 --> 02:07:07.950
And Stephen King on writing,

4325
02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:08.420
writing.

4326
02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:08.810
All right.

4327
02:07:08.810 --> 02:07:09.190
Yeah.

4328
02:07:09.190 --> 02:07:10.270
If you are a writer,

4329
02:07:10.300 --> 02:07:13.360
there's two books you need the war of art and Stephen King on writing.

4330
02:07:13.390 --> 02:07:14.450
Those are the two we want to stay.

4331
02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:14.830
Steven,

4332
02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:15.551
Steven Pressfield's,

4333
02:07:15.551 --> 02:07:15.910
the war,

4334
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:18.430
the war or not and his new one turning pro.

4335
02:07:18.431 --> 02:07:19.610
It's equally brilliant.

4336
02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:19.990
Yeah.

4337
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.500
Plastic.

4338
02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:24.790
Don't ever get an audio book that Stephen King reads cause he's fucking boring

4339
02:07:24.791 --> 02:07:25.350
as shit.

4340
02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:25.760
Okay.

4341
02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:26.830
He'll put your right to sleep.

4342
02:07:26.831 --> 02:07:26.981
I mean,

4343
02:07:26.981 --> 02:07:29.410
the guy's the greatest author ever as far as I'm concerned.

4344
02:07:29.411 --> 02:07:29.561
Yeah,

4345
02:07:29.561 --> 02:07:29.921
I agree.

4346
02:07:29.921 --> 02:07:30.020
Yeah,

4347
02:07:30.020 --> 02:07:30.221
he's,

4348
02:07:30.221 --> 02:07:30.620
he is,

4349
02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:31.391
he is the best.

4350
02:07:31.391 --> 02:07:32.230
He writes just a,

4351
02:07:32.231 --> 02:07:33.580
just an amazing Marita.

4352
02:07:33.581 --> 02:07:34.660
There's amazing stories.

4353
02:07:34.661 --> 02:07:35.560
He's got gift.

4354
02:07:35.620 --> 02:07:37.030
Fantastic gift of writing a story.

4355
02:07:37.060 --> 02:07:37.301
Yeah.

4356
02:07:37.301 --> 02:07:40.060
I remember reading some of his stuff and I was a young teenager,

4357
02:07:40.090 --> 02:07:40.751
like thinking like,

4358
02:07:40.751 --> 02:07:41.081
Jesus,

4359
02:07:41.081 --> 02:07:42.250
I shouldn't even be reading this.

4360
02:07:42.490 --> 02:07:43.450
What the fuck?

4361
02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:43.920
Yeah.

4362
02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:44.550
Like the,

4363
02:07:44.550 --> 02:07:45.780
his descriptions like that,

4364
02:07:45.781 --> 02:07:47.080
they bordered on creepy,

4365
02:07:47.081 --> 02:07:48.690
like some of the sexual stuff and yeah,

4366
02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:49.690
he's in it.

4367
02:07:49.690 --> 02:07:50.740
He's just a beast.

4368
02:07:50.850 --> 02:07:51.380
Yeah.

4369
02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:51.760
Yeah.

4370
02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:55.240
But he's also been given a gift by the universe.

4371
02:07:55.990 --> 02:07:56.380
Right.

4372
02:07:56.380 --> 02:07:59.590
Amazing stories that make you want to keep turning the pages.

4373
02:07:59.591 --> 02:08:00.130
And you're right.

4374
02:08:00.130 --> 02:08:03.430
His book on writing for anybody who aspires to become a writer,

4375
02:08:03.670 --> 02:08:05.350
that is the first place you go.

4376
02:08:05.410 --> 02:08:06.820
Is it read Stephen King on writing?

4377
02:08:07.110 --> 02:08:07.330
Yeah.

4378
02:08:07.330 --> 02:08:08.230
It's a brilliant book.

4379
02:08:08.231 --> 02:08:12.610
And he's so forthcoming about all of his trials and struggles and yeah,

4380
02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:13.500
he's a,

4381
02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:13.830
uh,

4382
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:14.500
amazing,

4383
02:08:14.500 --> 02:08:17.920
and that's my favorite kind of movie is,

4384
02:08:17.960 --> 02:08:19.660
or his books,

4385
02:08:19.661 --> 02:08:21.190
like where it's just fantasy.

4386
02:08:21.610 --> 02:08:23.860
I don't need thanks to be real in my fiction.

4387
02:08:24.150 --> 02:08:24.540
You know,

4388
02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:24.780
I,

4389
02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:26.020
I enjoy fiction,

4390
02:08:26.021 --> 02:08:29.140
but I don't need to see like a really depressing movie where everybody's got

4391
02:08:29.141 --> 02:08:30.160
cancer and Oh my God,

4392
02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:31.300
so brilliantly acted,

4393
02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:32.433
stop,

4394
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:33.370
entertain me,

4395
02:08:33.550 --> 02:08:34.080
make me,

4396
02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:35.980
show me an evil car that kills people.

4397
02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:36.853
You know,

4398
02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:39.130
show me the dude next door neighbor's a werewolf.

4399
02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:40.640
<v 4>I think that's the,</v>

4400
02:08:40.641 --> 02:08:42.200
that's the rightest first task.

4401
02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:44.210
And the fiction writers first task is to entertain.

4402
02:08:44.330 --> 02:08:44.920
Did you,

4403
02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:46.610
you mean you said witches in this?

4404
02:08:46.611 --> 02:08:49.460
Did you throw some supernatural ship war?

4405
02:08:49.461 --> 02:08:49.950
God is,

4406
02:08:49.950 --> 02:08:51.230
is full of the supernatural.

4407
02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:51.490
And,

4408
02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:51.800
and,

4409
02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:54.680
and I was able to bounce off the fact because,

4410
02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:55.700
um,

4411
02:08:55.700 --> 02:09:00.320
the Aztec society has been rightly described as the last magical civilization.

4412
02:09:00.321 --> 02:09:00.661
They were,

4413
02:09:00.661 --> 02:09:00.731
it,

4414
02:09:00.731 --> 02:09:01.850
they were involved in,

4415
02:09:01.851 --> 02:09:03.710
in magic and witchcraft in a huge,

4416
02:09:03.740 --> 02:09:04.573
in a huge way.

4417
02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:05.051
And that,

4418
02:09:05.051 --> 02:09:06.230
but they also persecuted,

4419
02:09:06.231 --> 02:09:08.750
which is just as European society in the Middle Ages,

4420
02:09:08.751 --> 02:09:09.291
persecuted,

4421
02:09:09.291 --> 02:09:12.500
which is so they're strong supernatural elements in this,

4422
02:09:12.530 --> 02:09:13.221
in this story.

4423
02:09:13.221 --> 02:09:13.551
And I,

4424
02:09:13.551 --> 02:09:13.910
and,

4425
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:18.170
and in a way I think it's only possible to understand what happened between 15,

4426
02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:22.670
19 and 1521 when you take the beliefs in the supernatural into account,

4427
02:09:23.190 --> 02:09:24.290
it sounds like they were,

4428
02:09:24.380 --> 02:09:24.621
I mean,

4429
02:09:24.621 --> 02:09:29.320
what your description of a nation of serial killers is apt text word.

4430
02:09:29.330 --> 02:09:30.163
That's what they are.

4431
02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:31.580
And here's the thing is he,

4432
02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:32.420
I mean my,

4433
02:09:32.420 --> 02:09:37.130
my two set central female characters meet in what's called a fattening pen.

4434
02:09:37.580 --> 02:09:39.050
So this is what the aspects did.

4435
02:09:39.051 --> 02:09:39.201
They,

4436
02:09:39.201 --> 02:09:40.670
their human sacrificial victims,

4437
02:09:40.671 --> 02:09:40.941
they would,

4438
02:09:40.941 --> 02:09:41.481
first of all,

4439
02:09:41.481 --> 02:09:43.700
they would fatten them up in,

4440
02:09:43.770 --> 02:09:44.510
um,

4441
02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:45.320
prisons.

4442
02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:46.250
Why would they fatten them?

4443
02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:48.560
Because they wanted to present them to the God plump,

4444
02:09:49.130 --> 02:09:49.963
desirable.

4445
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:52.640
So they would fatten them for months on end.

4446
02:09:52.730 --> 02:09:54.160
And can you imagine living in,

4447
02:09:54.170 --> 02:09:55.040
that's your situation.

4448
02:09:55.041 --> 02:09:56.540
You've been put in the fattening pen,

4449
02:09:56.810 --> 02:10:00.650
they're feeding you this high calorie diet and at a certain date you're going to

4450
02:10:00.651 --> 02:10:02.540
be marched up there and have your heart cut out.

4451
02:10:02.570 --> 02:10:03.440
But that takes,

4452
02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:06.920
that takes some courage to resist.

4453
02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:11.770
<v 1>That's hill to con sacrifice of four days of 80,000 people.</v>

4454
02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:13.650
I told that to my friend Steve Rinella.

4455
02:10:13.651 --> 02:10:13.841
Noah,

4456
02:10:13.841 --> 02:10:14.860
and he didn't even believe me.

4457
02:10:14.861 --> 02:10:14.970
Yeah,

4458
02:10:14.970 --> 02:10:15.731
10 notch tit land,

4459
02:10:15.731 --> 02:10:16.390
by the way.

4460
02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:17.223
10 hours.

4461
02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:18.140
How do you say it?

4462
02:10:18.140 --> 02:10:18.990
[inaudible] club.

4463
02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:20.830
That was the ancient name of Mexico City.

4464
02:10:20.831 --> 02:10:22.810
You used to be an island in the middle of a lake,

4465
02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:26.730
approached by causeways and the temple was called [inaudible].

4466
02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:27.221
<v 4>No,</v>

4467
02:10:27.221 --> 02:10:29.470
that's actually 35 miles north of Mexico City.

4468
02:10:29.471 --> 02:10:31.480
That's a place that's the pyramid of the Sun,

4469
02:10:31.481 --> 02:10:35.450
the Pyramid of the moon and the pyramid of quite soco adol which the Aztecs

4470
02:10:35.451 --> 02:10:39.080
revered as the place where men became gods.

4471
02:10:39.110 --> 02:10:39.801
That is what,

4472
02:10:39.801 --> 02:10:41.890
but they didn't know who made tail to what can't they?

4473
02:10:41.970 --> 02:10:42.061
What?

4474
02:10:42.061 --> 02:10:46.460
[inaudible] was already remotely ancient when the Aztecs came into the Valley of

4475
02:10:46.461 --> 02:10:47.660
Mexico and encountered it.

4476
02:10:47.970 --> 02:10:48.840
<v 5>Pyramid of the sun.</v>

4477
02:10:48.841 --> 02:10:52.260
The completion of that was when they killed 80,000

4478
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.880
<v 4>no,</v>

4479
02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:53.150
no.

4480
02:10:53.150 --> 02:10:54.980
That was the pyramid of the war God,

4481
02:10:55.730 --> 02:10:57.490
which is why my novel is called War God,

4482
02:10:57.520 --> 02:10:58.353
and that stood out.

4483
02:10:58.450 --> 02:11:01.520
That stood in the heart of what is now Mexico City,

4484
02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:04.760
and when the Spanish took that city,

4485
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:08.480
the very first thing they did was to take that pyramid apart stone by stone.

4486
02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:09.350
Did you see what happen?

4487
02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:10.880
And Billy's recently.

4488
02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:11.571
Yeah,

4489
02:11:11.571 --> 02:11:11.991
so,

4490
02:11:11.991 --> 02:11:16.970
so an ancient Mayan pyramid is used as a construction material by some asshole

4491
02:11:17.410 --> 02:11:18.330
from who?

4492
02:11:18.331 --> 02:11:22.250
Who used diggers to just break down the body of the pyramid and use it to make

4493
02:11:22.251 --> 02:11:23.000
roads.

4494
02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:23.180
Yeah.

4495
02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:23.841
How crazy is,

4496
02:11:23.841 --> 02:11:25.940
it kind of sums up everything that's wrong with our culture.

4497
02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:27.710
That's not our culture.

4498
02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:28.460
Well,

4499
02:11:28.460 --> 02:11:29.090
that's the,

4500
02:11:29.090 --> 02:11:31.130
that's the place where John McAfee was living.

4501
02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:31.993
I referred whole.

4502
02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:33.441
Absolutely.

4503
02:11:33.441 --> 02:11:34.790
I refer to global culture,

4504
02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:36.860
global culture and production and consumption.

4505
02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:37.801
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

4506
02:11:37.801 --> 02:11:38.461
It is a,

4507
02:11:38.461 --> 02:11:40.930
it was astounding that someone would be willing to do that.

4508
02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:44.220
You're destroying an archeological site for just for it's limestone.

4509
02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:44.670
Yeah.

4510
02:11:44.670 --> 02:11:45.281
Like whoa.

4511
02:11:45.281 --> 02:11:47.270
Like that is some short sighted asshole.

4512
02:11:47.470 --> 02:11:47.930
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

4513
02:11:47.930 --> 02:11:48.400
Yeah.

4514
02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:49.220
It's incredible.

4515
02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:49.830
But the way that,

4516
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:50.561
but that doesn't,

4517
02:11:50.561 --> 02:11:53.680
that shortsightedness that the pursuit of short term goals,

4518
02:11:53.890 --> 02:11:58.000
which might be immediately profitable even though long term massively damaging.

4519
02:11:58.001 --> 02:12:01.510
Doesn't that actually completely sum up everything that's wrong with global

4520
02:12:01.511 --> 02:12:02.141
culture today.

4521
02:12:02.141 --> 02:12:03.460
I mean if you wanted to take one act,

4522
02:12:03.461 --> 02:12:05.080
which kind of expresses it,

4523
02:12:05.081 --> 02:12:05.651
that would be,

4524
02:12:05.651 --> 02:12:06.484
that would be it.

4525
02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:08.950
You know you don't think long term.

4526
02:12:08.951 --> 02:12:11.290
We don't think in terms of the sacred,

4527
02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:12.820
we don't the Amazon jungle,

4528
02:12:13.150 --> 02:12:14.730
nobody considers you know when the,

4529
02:12:14.740 --> 02:12:15.131
when the,

4530
02:12:15.131 --> 02:12:17.920
when it's being exploited as an economic resource,

4531
02:12:18.220 --> 02:12:20.500
what that means for our planet in the rot,

4532
02:12:20.530 --> 02:12:21.220
in the long run.

4533
02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:24.790
If all of those trees come down short term to many might've made out of it long

4534
02:12:24.791 --> 02:12:25.540
term.

4535
02:12:25.540 --> 02:12:26.980
We're losing the lungs of our planet.

4536
02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:32.090
<v 5>Pattern is the real issue with human beings is our ability to do things in large</v>

4537
02:12:32.091 --> 02:12:32.511
numbers.

4538
02:12:32.511 --> 02:12:37.130
That would be horrific if we did singularly the diffusion of responsibility that

4539
02:12:37.131 --> 02:12:42.131
comes from acting as a corporation or acting as an army or acting were horrific.

4540
02:12:42.441 --> 02:12:47.441
Things can be justified because you're only a part of one huge group of people

4541
02:12:47.991 --> 02:12:49.040
that are doing these things.

4542
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:50.840
<v 4>We talked about science.</v>

4543
02:12:50.841 --> 02:12:53.570
There's been some interesting science done on exactly that point,

4544
02:12:54.110 --> 02:12:56.210
which is that they set it up with actors.

4545
02:12:56.211 --> 02:12:59.520
You put a situation where somebody is on the street and they're in jeopardy.

4546
02:12:59.521 --> 02:13:01.310
Perhaps a woman is perhaps being attacked.

4547
02:13:02.060 --> 02:13:04.760
If there are two or three people walking on the street,

4548
02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:08.090
they will almost always intervene to prevent the attack,

4549
02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:10.580
but if there's a thousand people walking on the street,

4550
02:13:10.590 --> 02:13:11.510
nobody intervenes.

4551
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:12.600
Yeah.

4552
02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:13.160
Well,

4553
02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:13.993
I think

4554
02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:17.490
<v 5>that happens most of the time it can happen,</v>

4555
02:13:17.491 --> 02:13:19.230
but I think a lot of people would intervene.

4556
02:13:19.290 --> 02:13:19.480
Yeah,

4557
02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:19.711
yeah.

4558
02:13:19.711 --> 02:13:19.940
You know,

4559
02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:21.930
I think once one of those weird things,

4560
02:13:21.931 --> 02:13:26.760
that is like a psychological principle that gets brought up as a sort of,

4561
02:13:26.761 --> 02:13:28.020
as a matter of fact,

4562
02:13:28.350 --> 02:13:31.050
I don't necessarily think it's a matter of fact because if I saw someone raping

4563
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:32.370
and I kicked her ass,

4564
02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:33.840
but you might try at least

4565
02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:36.000
<v 4>be the the extraordinary exception.</v>

4566
02:13:36.070 --> 02:13:36.360
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

4567
02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:37.190
I don't think so.

4568
02:13:37.190 --> 02:13:38.660
I think there's a lot of people jump in,

4569
02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:41.960
but you hear stories like that all the time where people save someone from this

4570
02:13:41.961 --> 02:13:43.070
and you did something there.

4571
02:13:43.340 --> 02:13:48.050
I think it's more likely that cowards would walk away if there's a thousand

4572
02:13:48.051 --> 02:13:48.800
people,

4573
02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:53.180
but they're still at a thousand people who's going to do something as somebody

4574
02:13:53.181 --> 02:13:54.830
who realizes we're all in this together.

4575
02:13:55.190 --> 02:13:55.640
<v 4>Loyalty,</v>

4576
02:13:55.640 --> 02:13:55.980
right.

4577
02:13:55.980 --> 02:13:58.430
I share your faith in the human race.

4578
02:13:58.431 --> 02:14:01.400
I think we have amazing potential,

4579
02:14:01.401 --> 02:14:02.660
amazing capacity to love,

4580
02:14:02.661 --> 02:14:06.680
amazing capacity to give amazing generosity and decency.

4581
02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:08.960
That's what I encounter day to day.

4582
02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:09.731
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

4583
02:14:09.731 --> 02:14:10.451
For the most part,

4584
02:14:10.451 --> 02:14:10.691
right?

4585
02:14:10.691 --> 02:14:10.900
Yeah.

4586
02:14:10.900 --> 02:14:12.160
Mostly people are awesome.

4587
02:14:12.230 --> 02:14:12.580
Yeah.

4588
02:14:12.580 --> 02:14:17.380
It's just a few of these Montezuma motherfuckers running around killing

4589
02:14:17.381 --> 02:14:18.160
everybody.

4590
02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:20.050
And throughout history there's been,

4591
02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:20.410
gee,

4592
02:14:20.410 --> 02:14:20.890
you know,

4593
02:14:20.890 --> 02:14:25.890
giant groups of people led by serial killers and that's a big part of that other

4594
02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:27.490
part of reality.

4595
02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:28.780
They're the ones who go for that job.

4596
02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:29.411
Yeah.

4597
02:14:29.411 --> 02:14:33.460
I'm a big fan of this podcast called hardcore history that it's talking about

4598
02:14:33.461 --> 02:14:34.150
all the time.

4599
02:14:34.150 --> 02:14:34.510
But,

4600
02:14:34.510 --> 02:14:34.930
um,

4601
02:14:34.930 --> 02:14:37.480
I've been listening to it lately.

4602
02:14:37.481 --> 02:14:37.841
It's been,

4603
02:14:37.841 --> 02:14:38.674
uh,

4604
02:14:39.190 --> 02:14:39.520
uh,

4605
02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:40.181
talk about,

4606
02:14:40.181 --> 02:14:40.540
uh,

4607
02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:43.030
the Nazis in World War II.

4608
02:14:43.110 --> 02:14:43.630
And,

4609
02:14:43.630 --> 02:14:44.620
but it's when you,

4610
02:14:44.621 --> 02:14:48.580
when you go back and pay attention to some of the things that happened in

4611
02:14:48.581 --> 02:14:53.581
history and you see the amazing level of ruthlessness that people exhibited,

4612
02:14:53.940 --> 02:14:54.670
uh,

4613
02:14:54.670 --> 02:14:58.510
against their enemies just drew out the history of humans.

4614
02:14:58.511 --> 02:14:59.800
There's been groups that flared up,

4615
02:14:59.801 --> 02:15:02.390
whether it's the Mongols are the Nazis or you know,

4616
02:15:02.410 --> 02:15:03.370
the Romans are there.

4617
02:15:03.380 --> 02:15:06.280
This has been so many groups of ruthless people.

4618
02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:07.001
<v 4>Now,</v>

4619
02:15:07.001 --> 02:15:07.440
Joe,

4620
02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:07.681
I mean,

4621
02:15:07.681 --> 02:15:07.901
you know,

4622
02:15:07.901 --> 02:15:08.340
when,

4623
02:15:08.340 --> 02:15:12.280
when a drone flies over a village in Afghanistan or Pakistan and,

4624
02:15:12.310 --> 02:15:14.380
and 120 people get slaughtered.

4625
02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:15.131
Yeah,

4626
02:15:15.131 --> 02:15:15.911
it's a bit remote.

4627
02:15:15.911 --> 02:15:16.721
It's a bit distant.

4628
02:15:16.721 --> 02:15:17.890
We're not getting our hands dirty,

4629
02:15:17.891 --> 02:15:19.180
but people are still being killed.

4630
02:15:19.380 --> 02:15:19.540
Well,

4631
02:15:19.540 --> 02:15:20.021
it's crazy.

4632
02:15:20.021 --> 02:15:21.740
Children are being deprived of their parents.

4633
02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:22.990
<v 5>Children dying.</v>

4634
02:15:22.991 --> 02:15:27.160
Children are getting the names and the numbers are so skewed in,

4635
02:15:27.161 --> 02:15:28.600
in the favor of,

4636
02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:29.200
uh,

4637
02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:32.800
people who were the casualties that were innocent.

4638
02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:36.490
And there's way more people that are innocent that are getting killed by these

4639
02:15:36.491 --> 02:15:39.040
drones then because then they say,

4640
02:15:39.041 --> 02:15:39.161
well,

4641
02:15:39.161 --> 02:15:40.300
that's because these terrorists,

4642
02:15:40.301 --> 02:15:42.520
they do things in highly populated area as well.

4643
02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:44.830
Well then you can't do that.

4644
02:15:44.860 --> 02:15:46.330
You can't just say we're going to kill.

4645
02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:50.100
That's that is one of the most unamerican things you could ever did.

4646
02:15:50.101 --> 02:15:51.250
Terrible at American thing.

4647
02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:53.590
The idea that you could kill all these oppressed,

4648
02:15:53.591 --> 02:15:55.840
innocent people just to get this one bad guy.

4649
02:15:55.870 --> 02:15:57.490
It's patiently obviously role

4650
02:15:57.750 --> 02:15:59.190
<v 4>and yet at the level of government,</v>

4651
02:15:59.191 --> 02:16:00.660
nobody seems to have got it yet.

4652
02:16:00.661 --> 02:16:01.520
How wrong it is.

4653
02:16:01.521 --> 02:16:01.570
Yeah.

4654
02:16:01.570 --> 02:16:06.570
<v 5>It's diffusion of responsibility and a digital technological form of warfare</v>

4655
02:16:07.241 --> 02:16:07.850
form.

4656
02:16:07.850 --> 02:16:08.140
Yeah,

4657
02:16:08.140 --> 02:16:08.973
completely.

4658
02:16:09.190 --> 02:16:09.401
I mean,

4659
02:16:09.401 --> 02:16:10.330
no one's even there.

4660
02:16:10.331 --> 02:16:11.770
I mean this is what we can do.

4661
02:16:11.771 --> 02:16:13.930
Instead of doing some horrific war crimes,

4662
02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:16.960
we send soldiers in there to slaughter all these innocence to get these bad

4663
02:16:16.961 --> 02:16:17.740
people.

4664
02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:18.461
Instead of doing that,

4665
02:16:18.461 --> 02:16:19.900
which is totally unacceptable.

4666
02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:22.300
We'll just do it this way where you're not even really there.

4667
02:16:22.350 --> 02:16:22.651
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

4668
02:16:22.651 --> 02:16:26.190
Like seven guys sitting in a control tower playing a computer game really

4669
02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:26.381
<v 5>well.</v>

4670
02:16:26.381 --> 02:16:28.000
How about the fact they're going to give the metals?

4671
02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:29.970
That was one of the big things there.

4672
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:31.470
They're going to give drone pilots,

4673
02:16:31.471 --> 02:16:32.520
metals and people are like,

4674
02:16:32.521 --> 02:16:34.020
what are you doing?

4675
02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:35.670
Like this is getting,

4676
02:16:35.671 --> 02:16:37.230
but no act of courage is involved.

4677
02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:39.120
Well,

4678
02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:42.450
apparently there's been new scandal where four Americans were killed and a

4679
02:16:42.451 --> 02:16:44.220
recent drums drone strike.

4680
02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:49.400
And now Obama is trying to restrict the use of drones and trying to say that

4681
02:16:50.041 --> 02:16:51.540
they can't be used on Americans,

4682
02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:55.320
but whatever we live in strange times,

4683
02:16:55.321 --> 02:16:56.154
we live in strange times.

4684
02:16:56.160 --> 02:17:00.090
Is it because our humanity has not yet caught up to our technological

4685
02:17:00.091 --> 02:17:01.300
capabilities that we are,

4686
02:17:01.450 --> 02:17:06.450
we are evolved techno technologically so much in the past several hundred years.

4687
02:17:07.351 --> 02:17:10.050
We've like literally change the world entirely.

4688
02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:11.790
But yet the tissue,

4689
02:17:11.820 --> 02:17:12.720
the DNA,

4690
02:17:12.721 --> 02:17:13.350
the,

4691
02:17:13.350 --> 02:17:13.621
the,

4692
02:17:13.621 --> 02:17:13.951
the,

4693
02:17:13.951 --> 02:17:14.221
the,

4694
02:17:14.221 --> 02:17:19.221
the echoes of the past that lie in our language and in our cultures has really

4695
02:17:19.681 --> 02:17:22.140
not caught up by any stretch of the imagination.

4696
02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:23.040
<v 4>Good point.</v>

4697
02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:23.851
I think that's,

4698
02:17:23.851 --> 02:17:24.780
I think that's a good point.

4699
02:17:24.781 --> 02:17:25.051
We,

4700
02:17:25.051 --> 02:17:26.010
we've got these,

4701
02:17:26.011 --> 02:17:26.844
um,

4702
02:17:27.090 --> 02:17:28.470
we've got these incredible toys,

4703
02:17:28.471 --> 02:17:30.660
but we haven't learned to play with them responsibility yet.

4704
02:17:30.850 --> 02:17:30.971
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

4705
02:17:30.971 --> 02:17:34.210
We've got this barbaric mindset that's still in place to run.

4706
02:17:34.211 --> 02:17:34.540
Shit.

4707
02:17:34.540 --> 02:17:35.500
If you want to run shit,

4708
02:17:35.501 --> 02:17:36.640
you gotta be a fucking savage.

4709
02:17:36.660 --> 02:17:41.610
<v 4>The mindset hasn't changed that much in the last thousand or 500 years.</v>

4710
02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:41.851
But yeah,

4711
02:17:41.851 --> 02:17:42.684
we're hopeful.

4712
02:17:42.930 --> 02:17:44.280
But we are hopeful and I,

4713
02:17:44.281 --> 02:17:46.260
and I and I remain hopeful.

4714
02:17:46.530 --> 02:17:49.890
I think it's a wonderful thing to be human.

4715
02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:52.020
It's a great gift to be born in the human body.

4716
02:17:52.050 --> 02:17:52.883
We have this,

4717
02:17:53.550 --> 02:17:54.383
you know,

4718
02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:56.790
that's part of it actually is the,

4719
02:17:58.740 --> 02:18:03.570
what did the human predicament is the predicament of making choices between

4720
02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:07.020
alternatives between good and evil,

4721
02:18:07.050 --> 02:18:09.120
between dark and light and the world.

4722
02:18:09.150 --> 02:18:12.330
Our world we live in today is filled with darkness and with light.

4723
02:18:12.450 --> 02:18:16.680
But the one thing that all of us can do as individuals is we can make the right

4724
02:18:16.681 --> 02:18:18.810
choice rather than the the wrong choice.

4725
02:18:18.811 --> 02:18:21.330
We don't have to add to the misery in the world.

4726
02:18:21.331 --> 02:18:24.360
Not even one tiny fraction.

4727
02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:27.390
We always got the choices we make.

4728
02:18:27.900 --> 02:18:31.710
Those are our responsibility alone and now we cannot develop those on others.

4729
02:18:31.711 --> 02:18:33.090
We can't say it's the government's fault.

4730
02:18:33.091 --> 02:18:34.920
The choices we make are our choices.

4731
02:18:35.250 --> 02:18:37.400
<v 5>That is the message of Iowasca isn't.</v>

4732
02:18:37.401 --> 02:18:37.820
Yes.

4733
02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:38.880
That's the message of Ios.

4734
02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:40.520
That's why everybody needs it.

4735
02:18:40.660 --> 02:18:41.410
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

4736
02:18:41.410 --> 02:18:41.770
Yeah.

4737
02:18:41.770 --> 02:18:42.730
Because your choices,

4738
02:18:42.731 --> 02:18:45.480
your choices are yours and your choices we'll define.

4739
02:18:45.481 --> 02:18:45.560
Yeah.

4740
02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:45.890
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

4741
02:18:45.890 --> 02:18:48.920
Isn't it funny that that would be one of the single most

4742
02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:53.720
powerful changing elements in this,

4743
02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:54.561
in this culture.

4744
02:18:54.561 --> 02:18:58.490
If all of a sudden IOWASCA center started opening them up and we started

4745
02:18:58.491 --> 02:19:00.500
exploring it scientifically,

4746
02:19:00.501 --> 02:19:01.334
we started

4747
02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:02.920
<v 4>as long as the content,</v>

4748
02:19:03.130 --> 02:19:04.900
those centers were run by goodhearted,

4749
02:19:04.980 --> 02:19:05.813
paid by Goodheart,

4750
02:19:06.270 --> 02:19:11.270
who had the capacity to love and wanted the betterment of mankind rather than

4751
02:19:11.311 --> 02:19:13.610
who was seeking personal gain or personal power,

4752
02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:16.760
<v 5>the evil ones in the Peru and where have you,</v>

4753
02:19:17.210 --> 02:19:18.560
are they taking it as well?

4754
02:19:18.590 --> 02:19:19.190
Yeah.

4755
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:22.370
So they're taking it and doing evil things once they take it,

4756
02:19:22.371 --> 02:19:22.791
I'm afraid.

4757
02:19:22.791 --> 02:19:23.030
So,

4758
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.450
yeah.

4759
02:19:23.450 --> 02:19:23.930
Wow.

4760
02:19:23.930 --> 02:19:24.590
So you,

4761
02:19:24.590 --> 02:19:28.030
do you think that they're just psychopaths that got of some Iowasca

4762
02:19:28.030 --> 02:19:28.740
<v 1>and that funny?</v>

4763
02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:30.040
Can't fix that kind of crazy.

4764
02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:30.761
<v 4>Yes.</v>

4765
02:19:30.761 --> 02:19:31.301
If you,

4766
02:19:31.301 --> 02:19:31.601
if,

4767
02:19:31.601 --> 02:19:35.860
if you come to this medicine with wicked intent,

4768
02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:37.630
then bad things can happen.

4769
02:19:38.170 --> 02:19:41.350
<v 1>So you really believe in the idea of entities being evil.</v>

4770
02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:42.770
You believe in the,

4771
02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:43.150
the,

4772
02:19:43.150 --> 02:19:45.370
the communication of evil entities.

4773
02:19:46.290 --> 02:19:47.040
<v 4>I think it's a,</v>

4774
02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:49.410
I think it's a very interesting possibility,

4775
02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:51.690
which explains a lot in human history.

4776
02:19:52.380 --> 02:19:53.213
Demons,

4777
02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:54.593
demons.

4778
02:19:54.600 --> 02:19:55.590
I think it's a,

4779
02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:57.510
I think that's a simple shorthand for it,

4780
02:19:57.540 --> 02:20:00.540
just as just as there are also angels.

4781
02:20:00.600 --> 02:20:05.220
I think that the reality is much more complicated than we imagine that a,

4782
02:20:05.221 --> 02:20:06.270
that there are huge,

4783
02:20:06.330 --> 02:20:08.880
unseen realms which impact upon us in,

4784
02:20:08.881 --> 02:20:10.080
in important ways.

4785
02:20:10.500 --> 02:20:11.390
And uh,

4786
02:20:11.430 --> 02:20:14.100
we are interacting with them whether we like it or not.

4787
02:20:14.190 --> 02:20:18.990
And in certain states of consciousness that interaction can become conscious and

4788
02:20:18.991 --> 02:20:21.360
we can and we can gain access to those,

4789
02:20:21.660 --> 02:20:22.440
to those realms.

4790
02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:23.550
And furthermore,

4791
02:20:24.030 --> 02:20:24.510
um,

4792
02:20:24.510 --> 02:20:26.720
I would say I,

4793
02:20:27.300 --> 02:20:29.970
I believe ultimately in the unity of all things,

4794
02:20:30.300 --> 02:20:34.140
but right now in this particular learning experience that we're undergoing in a

4795
02:20:34.141 --> 02:20:35.250
human incarnation,

4796
02:20:35.640 --> 02:20:38.850
I think it's really useful that those choices exist.

4797
02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:39.601
What after all,

4798
02:20:39.601 --> 02:20:41.620
if everything was all good and,

4799
02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:46.320
and rosy and perfect and that were not possible to do wrong,

4800
02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:50.100
what could we learn from this experience of life if we don't have the

4801
02:20:50.101 --> 02:20:51.780
opportunity to make mistakes?

4802
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.823
If we don't,

4803
02:20:53.370 --> 02:20:55.920
if we are not faced with fundamental choices,

4804
02:20:55.940 --> 02:20:56.150
what,

4805
02:20:56.150 --> 02:21:00.150
what would we benefit from in living this life in a human body?

4806
02:21:00.310 --> 02:21:00.461
<v 1>Well,</v>

4807
02:21:00.461 --> 02:21:00.791
you know,

4808
02:21:00.791 --> 02:21:03.790
that's one of the main arguments for computer simulation theory.

4809
02:21:03.910 --> 02:21:04.721
Excellent argument.

4810
02:21:04.721 --> 02:21:05.110
Yeah.

4811
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:08.050
It's one of the main arguments is that we've got ourselves to a point where life

4812
02:21:08.051 --> 02:21:10.780
is fucking boring cause we've solved all the problems,

4813
02:21:10.781 --> 02:21:12.940
we've eliminated all the stress and conflict.

4814
02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:15.550
We haven't solved all the problems.

4815
02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:17.560
This is a computer simulation.

4816
02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:21.430
The life we are living that we're in the roaring twenties of the digital era.

4817
02:21:21.490 --> 02:21:22.630
We're in the simulation.

4818
02:21:22.690 --> 02:21:23.320
Yeah.

4819
02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:24.490
Where it's indiscernible.

4820
02:21:24.570 --> 02:21:24.751
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

4821
02:21:24.751 --> 02:21:25.340
What is,

4822
02:21:25.340 --> 02:21:29.610
it's quite possible to imagine virtual reality even in our technology today,

4823
02:21:29.611 --> 02:21:32.850
getting to the point where you wouldn't know that it was virtual,

4824
02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:36.180
where you're totally immersed in that reality and for all we now Joe,

4825
02:21:36.510 --> 02:21:38.040
that's exactly what you and I are.

4826
02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.450
And at the end of our lifespan,

4827
02:21:42.570 --> 02:21:45.510
our 70 or 80 years or however many years we get,

4828
02:21:45.530 --> 02:21:46.050
you know,

4829
02:21:46.050 --> 02:21:49.620
random element in that we're going to step out and find ourselves in a room and

4830
02:21:49.621 --> 02:21:52.920
when we've been where we've been playing this game all along and then we'll be

4831
02:21:52.921 --> 02:21:54.660
scored on what we did,

4832
02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:55.620
you know,

4833
02:21:55.620 --> 02:21:55.911
and,

4834
02:21:55.911 --> 02:21:56.231
and,

4835
02:21:56.231 --> 02:21:56.680
and,

4836
02:21:56.680 --> 02:21:56.981
and,

4837
02:21:56.981 --> 02:21:57.814
and did we,

4838
02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:01.410
did we actually fulfill the objectives that we set out at the beginning of the

4839
02:22:01.411 --> 02:22:01.801
game.

4840
02:22:01.801 --> 02:22:03.270
With there you get there,

4841
02:22:03.271 --> 02:22:06.110
you get actually with that idea of a computer simulation,

4842
02:22:06.111 --> 02:22:06.944
do you actually get to the,

4843
02:22:07.230 --> 02:22:11.190
you find yourself coming full circle and meeting very ancient spiritual ideas

4844
02:22:11.460 --> 02:22:14.250
like that thing that I called the weighing of the,

4845
02:22:14.310 --> 02:22:15.143
of the soul,

4846
02:22:15.390 --> 02:22:16.650
the ancient Egyptian system.

4847
02:22:16.950 --> 02:22:17.640
That's where,

4848
02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:21.330
that's where you get scored on how you performed in the computer game and how

4849
02:22:21.331 --> 02:22:23.520
you maybe how you performed was not,

4850
02:22:23.820 --> 02:22:24.151
you know,

4851
02:22:24.151 --> 02:22:26.700
how much money you made or how much power you had.

4852
02:22:27.060 --> 02:22:29.730
Maybe it was really how much love you gave that was the,

4853
02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:31.380
that was the thing you most need it to do.

4854
02:22:31.890 --> 02:22:34.190
<v 5>Is it possible that the,</v>

4855
02:22:34.191 --> 02:22:34.470
the,

4856
02:22:34.470 --> 02:22:34.780
the,

4857
02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:38.370
those sorta the fractal nature of reality,

4858
02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:39.450
um,

4859
02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:44.190
manifest itself in the idea of these demons being that in that you,

4860
02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:47.760
you must reinforce good and you must punish bad.

4861
02:22:47.940 --> 02:22:51.930
And the only way these dumb people ever really completely understand is if they

4862
02:22:51.931 --> 02:22:55.470
feel a physical manifestation of the evil that they've caused.

4863
02:22:55.471 --> 02:22:56.580
And that's what a demon is.

4864
02:22:56.581 --> 02:23:00.600
So it's just sort of a guide rail that you bump into something that's supposed

4865
02:23:00.601 --> 02:23:02.520
to steer you towards the positive,

4866
02:23:02.730 --> 02:23:07.140
the very reason why you evolve after like a psychedelic trip,

4867
02:23:07.290 --> 02:23:09.180
seeing the bad that you're doing,

4868
02:23:09.630 --> 02:23:12.570
seeing the evil as manifested as an actual being.

4869
02:23:12.571 --> 02:23:13.020
Yeah.

4870
02:23:13.020 --> 02:23:16.920
Where it's most terrifying your common enemies that you have in real life,

4871
02:23:16.921 --> 02:23:18.630
whether it's predators or enemies,

4872
02:23:18.780 --> 02:23:20.430
there are physical manifestations.

4873
02:23:20.510 --> 02:23:21.200
<v 4>Absolutely.</v>

4874
02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:22.130
So we don't,

4875
02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:22.431
you know,

4876
02:23:22.431 --> 02:23:24.230
we don't know the answer to these questions.

4877
02:23:24.231 --> 02:23:26.810
These are these way of touching here upon a great mystery.

4878
02:23:27.380 --> 02:23:27.950
Uh,

4879
02:23:27.950 --> 02:23:32.450
people all over the world have these experiences and report remarkably similar

4880
02:23:32.451 --> 02:23:34.670
encounters with entities,

4881
02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:36.170
either demonic or angelic.

4882
02:23:36.171 --> 02:23:38.450
And this has been going on throughout human culture.

4883
02:23:38.900 --> 02:23:41.750
And it's a feature of the psychedelic experience as well,

4884
02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:44.780
and we don't know what those things are.

4885
02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:45.561
This is,

4886
02:23:45.561 --> 02:23:46.640
this is just not clear.

4887
02:23:46.641 --> 02:23:46.791
We'll,

4888
02:23:46.791 --> 02:23:50.150
do they have an independent existence from us or are they part of a teaching

4889
02:23:50.151 --> 02:23:52.910
program that we need to encounter as you're suggesting just now?

4890
02:23:52.940 --> 02:23:54.920
I think they're very interesting question is to examine,

4891
02:23:54.921 --> 02:23:56.060
but I don't know the answer to them.

4892
02:23:56.540 --> 02:23:58.130
<v 5>I've always had an issue with the,</v>

4893
02:23:58.131 --> 02:23:58.291
the,

4894
02:23:58.291 --> 02:24:02.360
the possibility of archetypes to that people have already established that

4895
02:24:02.361 --> 02:24:05.030
archetypes that people already have in their hands so that they,

4896
02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:05.391
you know,

4897
02:24:05.391 --> 02:24:05.671
when,

4898
02:24:05.671 --> 02:24:07.340
when the have an abduction experience,

4899
02:24:07.341 --> 02:24:08.720
what you think is an abduction as parents,

4900
02:24:08.980 --> 02:24:11.630
you sort of fill in the blanks with whatever these entities are,

4901
02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:11.961
all the,

4902
02:24:11.961 --> 02:24:13.580
all of a sudden they become these gray guys,

4903
02:24:13.581 --> 02:24:17.690
a big black eyes because that's the cultural archetype that we've sort of

4904
02:24:17.691 --> 02:24:20.120
subscribed to and in all these stories.

4905
02:24:20.121 --> 02:24:20.260
Yeah.

4906
02:24:20.260 --> 02:24:23.290
<v 4>Why do we find them painted on cave walls 25,000 years ago?</v>

4907
02:24:23.291 --> 02:24:24.160
That's a good question.

4908
02:24:24.210 --> 02:24:25.043
It's a good question.

4909
02:24:25.420 --> 02:24:26.530
Which ones did we find?

4910
02:24:26.590 --> 02:24:27.423
Well,

4911
02:24:27.490 --> 02:24:29.030
particularly on the walls of,

4912
02:24:29.300 --> 02:24:29.621
in fact,

4913
02:24:29.621 --> 02:24:33.040
on a little alcove in the ceiling inside Pesh male cave in France.

4914
02:24:33.041 --> 02:24:37.700
There's a fantastically recognizable depiction of what we would call a gray

4915
02:24:37.701 --> 02:24:38.490
today.

4916
02:24:38.490 --> 02:24:39.323
Can you pull that up?

4917
02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:39.690
Okay.

4918
02:24:39.690 --> 02:24:40.780
How you spell column there?

4919
02:24:40.781 --> 02:24:41.614
The um,

4920
02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:42.910
the um,

4921
02:24:43.330 --> 02:24:44.163
uh,

4922
02:24:44.230 --> 02:24:45.670
the wounded man sometimes he's,

4923
02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:46.461
he's passionate.

4924
02:24:46.461 --> 02:24:48.940
L P E C h m e R,

4925
02:24:48.941 --> 02:24:49.210
l,

4926
02:24:49.210 --> 02:24:50.043
e,

4927
02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:50.993
passion male,

4928
02:24:51.310 --> 02:24:55.330
and he is peers through the body with a number of spears and he has this kind of

4929
02:24:55.331 --> 02:25:00.331
high domed forehead and narrow pointed Chin and just a hint of large,

4930
02:25:00.941 --> 02:25:01.710
dark eyes.

4931
02:25:01.710 --> 02:25:05.980
<v 5>Do you think that these things are actually physically visiting or do you think</v>

4932
02:25:05.981 --> 02:25:09.700
that there's a chemical doorway that's a open through psychedelics or through

4933
02:25:09.701 --> 02:25:12.430
some technology and that that's how they're appearing?

4934
02:25:12.570 --> 02:25:15.270
<v 4>I think it's a chemical doorway.</v>

4935
02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:16.630
I think that we have a,

4936
02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:21.660
I think we have a headend doorway inside our minds through which we can project

4937
02:25:21.661 --> 02:25:25.000
our consciousness into levels of reality.

4938
02:25:25.001 --> 02:25:26.230
I can't prove that,

4939
02:25:26.290 --> 02:25:27.390
but that's what I,

4940
02:25:27.630 --> 02:25:29.440
I think maybe maybe going on.

4941
02:25:29.540 --> 02:25:32.370
<v 5>That's what it feels to you when you experienced this as what it feels to me</v>

4942
02:25:32.371 --> 02:25:33.510
like that I mentoring,

4943
02:25:33.511 --> 02:25:34.050
um,

4944
02:25:34.050 --> 02:25:34.141
uh,

4945
02:25:34.141 --> 02:25:36.690
seamlessly convincing parallel world.

4946
02:25:36.750 --> 02:25:37.291
And again,

4947
02:25:37.291 --> 02:25:40.110
I want to stress the point that because you've had this experience,

4948
02:25:40.111 --> 02:25:41.850
this is true experiences.

4949
02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:43.680
If they're just a hallucination,

4950
02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:45.970
a byproduct of the mind that is impossible.

4951
02:25:45.971 --> 02:25:48.810
The prove you're still having the exact same experience.

4952
02:25:49.020 --> 02:25:49.530
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

4953
02:25:49.530 --> 02:25:50.181
You're still having the,

4954
02:25:50.181 --> 02:25:51.001
it's actually an experience.

4955
02:25:51.001 --> 02:25:53.820
So there you come back to the point we made earlier that what do you then learn

4956
02:25:53.821 --> 02:25:54.720
from that experience?

4957
02:25:54.721 --> 02:25:57.330
And if you grow in some way through that experience,

4958
02:25:57.331 --> 02:25:58.770
it doesn't really matter whether it's

4959
02:25:59.310 --> 02:26:01.830
<v 5>freestanding reality or whether it's a,</v>

4960
02:26:01.831 --> 02:26:02.191
you know,

4961
02:26:02.191 --> 02:26:03.090
something you projected.

4962
02:26:03.091 --> 02:26:07.440
And as we become more interconnected with our ability to communicate and our,

4963
02:26:07.441 --> 02:26:07.651
our,

4964
02:26:07.651 --> 02:26:07.971
our,

4965
02:26:07.971 --> 02:26:12.090
our idea that the human race really is one gigantic super organism.

4966
02:26:12.540 --> 02:26:16.500
As we accept that idea more and more,

4967
02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:16.950
it,

4968
02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:19.590
it opens up a lot of other possibilities.

4969
02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:24.620
It opens up a lot of pot possibilities for just our overall view of things.

4970
02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:26.473
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

4971
02:26:26.810 --> 02:26:27.051
yeah,

4972
02:26:27.051 --> 02:26:27.710
sure.

4973
02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:28.521
This is a,

4974
02:26:28.521 --> 02:26:29.480
this is the,

4975
02:26:30.050 --> 02:26:30.980
the new,

4976
02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:31.640
um,

4977
02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:34.550
Copernican revolution that we're poised on the edge of,

4978
02:26:34.551 --> 02:26:34.911
you know,

4979
02:26:34.911 --> 02:26:35.900
at one time,

4980
02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:36.801
uh,

4981
02:26:36.801 --> 02:26:38.570
it was considered that the,

4982
02:26:38.580 --> 02:26:38.930
uh,

4983
02:26:38.930 --> 02:26:43.880
that the sun went around the earth and that all the stars revolved around the

4984
02:26:43.881 --> 02:26:46.130
earth and the earth was fixed and still in the center.

4985
02:26:46.610 --> 02:26:51.290
And then some people started having experiences or if you like finding data

4986
02:26:51.291 --> 02:26:55.040
which contradicted that and eventually a whole worldview was,

4987
02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:55.910
was thrown away.

4988
02:26:55.911 --> 02:26:56.744
And I think we're,

4989
02:26:56.770 --> 02:26:57.100
you know,

4990
02:26:57.100 --> 02:26:59.690
at the edge of moving into a new,

4991
02:26:59.691 --> 02:26:59.930
into,

4992
02:26:59.930 --> 02:27:03.680
into a whole new revolution about the nature of reality that it is just much

4993
02:27:03.681 --> 02:27:05.900
more complicated than we've imagined.

4994
02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:06.310
Um,

4995
02:27:06.310 --> 02:27:06.501
yeah,

4996
02:27:06.501 --> 02:27:07.220
that's a,

4997
02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:08.990
that's a kind of sketch of the patch male figure.

4998
02:27:08.991 --> 02:27:10.940
That's not the original cave painting.

4999
02:27:10.941 --> 02:27:15.440
And I'm afraid the only Ufos that are actually present are the ones above the

5000
02:27:15.441 --> 02:27:16.101
individuals had.

5001
02:27:16.101 --> 02:27:17.210
The other two are not there in the,

5002
02:27:17.310 --> 02:27:19.110
<v 5>so let's go see if you can find the original one,</v>

5003
02:27:19.111 --> 02:27:19.381
Jamie.

5004
02:27:19.381 --> 02:27:19.790
Cause I only,

5005
02:27:19.790 --> 02:27:22.970
it's like shit that looks like an animal to the,

5006
02:27:23.010 --> 02:27:23.311
you know,

5007
02:27:23.311 --> 02:27:23.821
who knows what.

5008
02:27:23.821 --> 02:27:25.560
They were really terrible at drawing to

5009
02:27:27.140 --> 02:27:27.450
drawing.

5010
02:27:27.450 --> 02:27:28.021
Some of them were,

5011
02:27:28.021 --> 02:27:30.570
some of the cave paintings are absolutely stunning.

5012
02:27:31.020 --> 02:27:31.853
I wouldn't pay for him.

5013
02:27:32.010 --> 02:27:33.480
I mean I would if I knew they were really old.

5014
02:27:33.481 --> 02:27:34.171
You'd haven't seen,

5015
02:27:34.171 --> 02:27:34.821
it's like some dude,

5016
02:27:34.821 --> 02:27:38.110
dude just came along and that was his version of a Buffalo Lake Bitch.

5017
02:27:38.210 --> 02:27:39.043
Yes.

5018
02:27:39.180 --> 02:27:43.110
You haven't seen what he's painted inside Chauvet Cave and I watched that

5019
02:27:43.111 --> 02:27:43.944
documentary,

5020
02:27:44.130 --> 02:27:45.280
the word of Herzog documentary.

5021
02:27:45.310 --> 02:27:45.530
I,

5022
02:27:45.530 --> 02:27:45.691
no,

5023
02:27:45.691 --> 02:27:46.270
it's amazing.

5024
02:27:46.270 --> 02:27:49.170
I'm joking around obviously as you can,

5025
02:27:49.380 --> 02:27:51.120
but still know.

5026
02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:52.830
I'd rather buy an Alex Gray painting.

5027
02:27:52.900 --> 02:27:53.431
I think it's shit.

5028
02:27:53.431 --> 02:27:53.940
It's cool.

5029
02:27:53.940 --> 02:27:54.291
Yeah.

5030
02:27:54.291 --> 02:27:56.880
I and I would like some frank Frazetta that's art to me.

5031
02:27:57.120 --> 02:27:59.130
There's no frank Frazetta on cave walls.

5032
02:27:59.490 --> 02:28:00.323
They didn't really,

5033
02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:02.980
I mean

5034
02:28:02.980 --> 02:28:04.330
<v 4>the caves,</v>

5035
02:28:04.420 --> 02:28:07.870
this is what the great experiences we can have as human beings is to go into

5036
02:28:07.871 --> 02:28:12.871
those painted caves and go in and silence and in darkness and just get a sense

5037
02:28:13.001 --> 02:28:13.834
of the atmosphere there.

5038
02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:15.190
Transformative spaces.

5039
02:28:15.230 --> 02:28:18.910
They knew something about set and setting in those times.

5040
02:28:18.940 --> 02:28:21.920
And of course I'm convinced they were using psychedelics.

5041
02:28:22.030 --> 02:28:22.800
<v 5>And that was a,</v>

5042
02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:24.290
the the caves in France

5043
02:28:24.450 --> 02:28:25.440
<v 4>or caves in France.</v>

5044
02:28:25.441 --> 02:28:26.370
Caves in Spain.

5045
02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:26.790
Yeah.

5046
02:28:26.790 --> 02:28:27.720
And what are the oldest ones?

5047
02:28:27.730 --> 02:28:28.480
Through the cave?

5048
02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:31.560
Very oldest is full Monte cave in Italy,

5049
02:28:31.590 --> 02:28:33.540
which is 35,000 years old.

5050
02:28:34.110 --> 02:28:37.950
Chauvet cave about 33 32,000 years old.

5051
02:28:38.210 --> 02:28:38.920
Uh,

5052
02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:39.221
they're,

5053
02:28:39.221 --> 02:28:39.511
they,

5054
02:28:39.511 --> 02:28:40.010
they're,

5055
02:28:40.010 --> 02:28:40.410
they're,

5056
02:28:40.410 --> 02:28:41.040
they're pretty,

5057
02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:41.873
pretty fucking Asia.

5058
02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:44.790
<v 5>So do you think that those were people that were living in those caves</v>

5059
02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:45.810
<v 4>that wouldn't be making,</v>

5060
02:28:45.810 --> 02:28:47.480
that artwork will never lived in those caves?

5061
02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:48.260
Never lived in them?

5062
02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:48.431
No.

5063
02:28:48.431 --> 02:28:48.590
No,

5064
02:28:48.590 --> 02:28:49.070
they didn't.

5065
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:50.570
They use them as sacred spaces.

5066
02:28:50.571 --> 02:28:52.340
They visited them in small numbers,

5067
02:28:52.700 --> 02:28:54.140
often separated.

5068
02:28:54.141 --> 02:28:57.620
There might be an interval of 2000 years between when one group went in and when

5069
02:28:57.621 --> 02:28:58.610
another group went in.

5070
02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:02.360
<v 5>So our idea of cave art as the lay person's ideas,</v>

5071
02:29:02.361 --> 02:29:04.310
these cave men were inside this cave.

5072
02:29:04.580 --> 02:29:07.100
And then at nighttime they would light fires and draw cave art.

5073
02:29:07.130 --> 02:29:07.963
That's not what was,

5074
02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:09.160
<v 4>they love it.</v>

5075
02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:10.390
They never lived in those spaces.

5076
02:29:10.391 --> 02:29:11.111
They lived outside.

5077
02:29:11.111 --> 02:29:11.944
They lived in,

5078
02:29:12.250 --> 02:29:12.761
you know,

5079
02:29:12.761 --> 02:29:14.800
in portable structures like tps.

5080
02:29:15.100 --> 02:29:15.550
Um,

5081
02:29:15.550 --> 02:29:16.060
they were,

5082
02:29:16.060 --> 02:29:20.740
they were hunter gatherers and they use the caves as sacred spaces are,

5083
02:29:20.741 --> 02:29:24.610
they communicated their most profound ideas about the spirit.

5084
02:29:24.910 --> 02:29:27.910
<v 5>So they were a lot more sophisticated than we like to believe.</v>

5085
02:29:27.940 --> 02:29:29.620
I would just as sophisticated as we are.

5086
02:29:29.740 --> 02:29:34.740
Was there ever a time before that that we know of where they weren't,

5087
02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:38.560
where like the Endo talls supposedly are being,

5088
02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:38.940
uh,

5089
02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:39.380
they,

5090
02:29:39.380 --> 02:29:39.651
they,

5091
02:29:39.651 --> 02:29:41.020
they did some cave art as well,

5092
02:29:41.080 --> 02:29:41.321
<v 4>correct.</v>

5093
02:29:41.321 --> 02:29:41.590
Yep.

5094
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:44.560
This is the new discovery that some of the very oldest cave art was almost

5095
02:29:44.561 --> 02:29:45.760
certainly done by neanderthals.

5096
02:29:45.761 --> 02:29:50.070
So the neanderthal image is due for a complete rehabilitation,

5097
02:29:50.280 --> 02:29:50.770
uh,

5098
02:29:50.770 --> 02:29:50.981
very,

5099
02:29:50.981 --> 02:29:51.280
very,

5100
02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:51.900
very sued.

5101
02:29:51.900 --> 02:29:52.270
Uh,

5102
02:29:52.270 --> 02:29:52.470
the,

5103
02:29:52.470 --> 02:29:53.530
the neanderthals,

5104
02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:56.560
the image that we have of neanderthals is completely wrong,

5105
02:29:57.100 --> 02:30:01.390
but there's a thing I call 6 million years of boredom,

5106
02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:02.343
which is,

5107
02:30:02.350 --> 02:30:02.711
you know,

5108
02:30:02.711 --> 02:30:05.950
from the last common ancestor with the chimpanzee through until,

5109
02:30:05.951 --> 02:30:06.191
well,

5110
02:30:06.191 --> 02:30:08.530
after the emergence of anatomically modern humans,

5111
02:30:08.531 --> 02:30:10.240
our ancestors were very dull.

5112
02:30:10.660 --> 02:30:12.160
Judging by what they left behind,

5113
02:30:12.250 --> 02:30:13.720
judging by what they produced,

5114
02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:16.390
they were not thinking laterally.

5115
02:30:16.391 --> 02:30:17.640
They were not creating the,

5116
02:30:17.641 --> 02:30:18.474
they were not,

5117
02:30:18.580 --> 02:30:20.710
they did not have spiritual concepts or ideas.

5118
02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:24.790
And it's rather like a light is switched on in the human brain all around the

5119
02:30:24.791 --> 02:30:26.980
world somewhere after a hundred thousand years ago,

5120
02:30:27.390 --> 02:30:28.250
um,

5121
02:30:28.660 --> 02:30:30.910
really 40,000 years ago,

5122
02:30:31.150 --> 02:30:35.740
that we get this amazing explosion of symbolic art and suddenly you recognize

5123
02:30:35.741 --> 02:30:38.800
that the creatures are just like us and that we are,

5124
02:30:38.830 --> 02:30:40.660
we are dealing with,

5125
02:30:40.661 --> 02:30:41.470
um,

5126
02:30:41.470 --> 02:30:43.690
with people we could communicate with on a,

5127
02:30:43.691 --> 02:30:44.050
on a,

5128
02:30:44.050 --> 02:30:45.010
on a symbolic level.

5129
02:30:45.040 --> 02:30:47.800
So something happened to our ancestors and I,

5130
02:30:47.801 --> 02:30:50.680
and I made this case extensively in my book,

5131
02:30:50.681 --> 02:30:51.311
supernatural,

5132
02:30:51.311 --> 02:30:55.060
that what happened to our ancestors was encounters with psychedelics.

5133
02:30:55.810 --> 02:31:00.810
That's what took us out of the dull and boring zone and put us into the realm of

5134
02:31:01.691 --> 02:31:03.550
imagination and creativity and spirit.

5135
02:31:04.310 --> 02:31:04.550
<v 5>Well,</v>

5136
02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:09.290
it's a fascinating idea and it's a weird one to dismiss because we know that the

5137
02:31:09.291 --> 02:31:12.620
impact of psychedelics on the mind is so astonishing.

5138
02:31:12.621 --> 02:31:16.370
It's very poopooed in marginalized because it's thought to be frivolous and

5139
02:31:16.371 --> 02:31:17.060
silly,

5140
02:31:17.060 --> 02:31:18.680
but that's only by people who haven't done it.

5141
02:31:18.730 --> 02:31:19.180
Yeah.

5142
02:31:19.180 --> 02:31:19.390
Yeah.

5143
02:31:19.390 --> 02:31:20.290
It's one of the weirdest

5144
02:31:20.290 --> 02:31:21.390
<v 1>things where it's,</v>

5145
02:31:21.391 --> 02:31:24.250
it's persecuted by people who really need it more than anybody.

5146
02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:26.131
<v 4>Exactly.</v>

5147
02:31:26.131 --> 02:31:26.581
Exactly.

5148
02:31:26.581 --> 02:31:27.040
I mean,

5149
02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:27.370
for,

5150
02:31:27.370 --> 02:31:32.370
for those who've never had a psychedelic experience to put down others who have

5151
02:31:32.611 --> 02:31:36.290
had it and to tell them that that experience is,

5152
02:31:36.291 --> 02:31:36.901
is wrong.

5153
02:31:36.901 --> 02:31:37.171
I mean,

5154
02:31:37.171 --> 02:31:38.520
that's like a cell a bit,

5155
02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:39.450
you know,

5156
02:31:39.450 --> 02:31:44.450
telling somebody not to have sex they celebrate has no experience of the thing

5157
02:31:45.661 --> 02:31:46.530
that they're talking about.

5158
02:31:46.770 --> 02:31:48.780
How dare they make judgments about that?

5159
02:31:49.620 --> 02:31:50.020
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

5160
02:31:50.020 --> 02:31:50.700
that's a good point.

5161
02:31:50.700 --> 02:31:52.050
It's strange,

5162
02:31:52.080 --> 02:31:53.040
but I think that,

5163
02:31:53.070 --> 02:31:53.820
um,

5164
02:31:53.820 --> 02:31:56.040
people like you that are brave enough to speak out about this,

5165
02:31:56.090 --> 02:31:56.551
in fact,

5166
02:31:56.551 --> 02:31:57.570
even write books about it,

5167
02:31:58.200 --> 02:31:58.640
that's,

5168
02:31:58.640 --> 02:32:02.520
that's the ripples that sends out this information and the universe picks it up

5169
02:32:02.820 --> 02:32:06.870
and the internet grabs it and duplicates it and throws it up on Twitter and then

5170
02:32:06.871 --> 02:32:07.260
boom,

5171
02:32:07.260 --> 02:32:10.860
we're off to the races and new ideas are introduced into the minds of the young

5172
02:32:10.861 --> 02:32:11.431
people who,

5173
02:32:11.431 --> 02:32:12.840
I think that's what,

5174
02:32:12.880 --> 02:32:13.800
what gives me up.

5175
02:32:13.890 --> 02:32:14.910
That's what gives me hope too.

5176
02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:16.890
Younger is fantastic.

5177
02:32:16.950 --> 02:32:18.720
Growing community of alert,

5178
02:32:18.721 --> 02:32:19.381
intelligent,

5179
02:32:19.381 --> 02:32:19.830
awake,

5180
02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:22.530
aware young people out there that grew up with the Internet,

5181
02:32:22.760 --> 02:32:24.830
<v 4>grew up with the Internet and um,</v>

5182
02:32:24.890 --> 02:32:25.311
that,

5183
02:32:25.311 --> 02:32:25.520
uh,

5184
02:32:25.520 --> 02:32:30.170
I'm not going to put up with all that shit any longer that comes down from a

5185
02:32:30.171 --> 02:32:32.120
hierarchical controlling,

5186
02:32:32.121 --> 02:32:33.080
dominated culture.

5187
02:32:33.470 --> 02:32:34.250
<v 1>Boom.</v>

5188
02:32:34.250 --> 02:32:35.250
Graham Hancock.

5189
02:32:35.330 --> 02:32:37.100
Just drop some science.

5190
02:32:38.480 --> 02:32:39.980
That was a beautiful conversation man.

5191
02:32:40.040 --> 02:32:40.760
Thank you very much.

5192
02:32:40.760 --> 02:32:42.200
Thank you to you got to do this more often.

5193
02:32:42.500 --> 02:32:43.160
I agree.

5194
02:32:43.160 --> 02:32:44.750
When are you back in a America?

5195
02:32:44.830 --> 02:32:45.710
Oh,

5196
02:32:45.740 --> 02:32:46.610
late October.

5197
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:51.380
So if people want to buy war God they can go to amazon.co.

5198
02:32:51.381 --> 02:32:51.651
Dot.

5199
02:32:51.651 --> 02:32:52.620
UK Right.

5200
02:32:52.621 --> 02:32:54.650
The easiest way to do it is to go to my website.

5201
02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:55.011
Okay.

5202
02:32:55.011 --> 02:32:57.450
Graham hancock.com [inaudible] dot com.

5203
02:32:57.500 --> 02:32:57.801
Okay.

5204
02:32:57.801 --> 02:32:58.491
You already have,

5205
02:32:58.491 --> 02:33:02.200
you have the Canadian and the UK link cause that's the two places that somebody

5206
02:33:02.510 --> 02:33:04.400
in Canada or Amazon UK would,

5207
02:33:04.401 --> 02:33:07.670
they can buy it there and hopefully even all our friends at audible or

5208
02:33:07.671 --> 02:33:08.270
listening,

5209
02:33:08.270 --> 02:33:08.721
hook it up,

5210
02:33:08.721 --> 02:33:09.440
bitch.

5211
02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:10.550
Get somebody to read it.

5212
02:33:10.551 --> 02:33:11.360
Come on.

5213
02:33:11.360 --> 02:33:13.310
I'd love to have that in my car when I'm driving around.

5214
02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:14.180
Um,

5215
02:33:14.180 --> 02:33:14.511
but I will,

5216
02:33:14.511 --> 02:33:15.530
I'll pick it up as well.

5217
02:33:15.620 --> 02:33:16.370
Support.

5218
02:33:16.370 --> 02:33:16.910
Frank.

5219
02:33:16.910 --> 02:33:17.570
Thank you sir.

5220
02:33:17.570 --> 02:33:18.020
Um,

5221
02:33:18.020 --> 02:33:19.490
and is that the original k word?

5222
02:33:19.610 --> 02:33:19.821
Yes,

5223
02:33:19.821 --> 02:33:20.320
it is.

5224
02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:20.740
There it is.

5225
02:33:20.740 --> 02:33:25.740
So you could see that high domed forehead up there could just be shitty art that

5226
02:33:26.511 --> 02:33:28.430
art start to see that you could see the dark guys.

5227
02:33:28.431 --> 02:33:28.581
Well,

5228
02:33:28.581 --> 02:33:29.121
what you could have,

5229
02:33:29.121 --> 02:33:29.810
but you know what?

5230
02:33:29.810 --> 02:33:32.060
It's also set up in the sky up above it.

5231
02:33:32.061 --> 02:33:32.301
I mean,

5232
02:33:32.301 --> 02:33:32.750
what is it?

5233
02:33:32.750 --> 02:33:33.220
Say something.

5234
02:33:33.220 --> 02:33:34.820
I got a three year old and she draws people.

5235
02:33:34.821 --> 02:33:35.930
They look exactly like that.

5236
02:33:37.100 --> 02:33:38.780
She's not trying to depict aliens.

5237
02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:40.430
She's just shitty at drawing.

5238
02:33:40.670 --> 02:33:41.180
This is,

5239
02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:41.600
you know,

5240
02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:43.550
it's the problem with this is is it's too,

5241
02:33:43.820 --> 02:33:44.810
it's too ambiguous.

5242
02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:46.280
It's like that's not good art.

5243
02:33:46.630 --> 02:33:46.931
I mean,

5244
02:33:46.931 --> 02:33:48.170
so I don't know what that is.

5245
02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:50.040
That a spider could be a spider.

5246
02:33:50.041 --> 02:33:50.900
It could be like a crab.

5247
02:33:51.430 --> 02:33:51.710
It's a,

5248
02:33:51.710 --> 02:33:56.020
it's a human thing in the upper left with spears pit pierced through his body.

5249
02:33:56.080 --> 02:33:57.290
What about that thing in the upper left?

5250
02:33:57.291 --> 02:33:58.420
What the hell is that thing there?

5251
02:33:58.421 --> 02:33:59.270
I nobody knows.

5252
02:33:59.300 --> 02:34:01.170
Nobody knows what he fucking shitty spider.

5253
02:34:04.220 --> 02:34:05.060
That guy sucked.

5254
02:34:05.330 --> 02:34:07.240
I hope that guy was way better at killing buffaloes.

5255
02:34:07.480 --> 02:34:07.880
Drugs.

5256
02:34:07.880 --> 02:34:08.361
A dog.

5257
02:34:08.361 --> 02:34:10.580
Shit to send you into the painted cave.

5258
02:34:11.060 --> 02:34:13.370
I think I'm joking around completely.

5259
02:34:13.371 --> 02:34:15.110
I mean this I'm not that impressed with,

5260
02:34:15.111 --> 02:34:16.070
I would like to look at it.

5261
02:34:16.071 --> 02:34:19.080
I'm thinking it's fascinating because it's so old as a work of art,

5262
02:34:19.081 --> 02:34:19.980
it's not impressive.

5263
02:34:19.981 --> 02:34:22.980
But as a subject matter what you know,

5264
02:34:22.981 --> 02:34:25.770
what is being depicted there is rather is rather interesting.

5265
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:30.090
I sort of disagree and this is why I disagree because this thing in the upper

5266
02:34:30.091 --> 02:34:30.381
left,

5267
02:34:30.381 --> 02:34:31.350
it might be a spider,

5268
02:34:31.530 --> 02:34:36.240
shows me a really rudimentary level of replicating what they're trying to draw.

5269
02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:37.530
That looks like shit.

5270
02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:38.940
And so this looks like shit too.

5271
02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:39.953
I don't know what it is.

5272
02:34:39.990 --> 02:34:41.610
It might be a bug,

5273
02:34:41.790 --> 02:34:43.560
it might be a an animal.

5274
02:34:43.710 --> 02:34:45.180
It's like the guy sucks at drawing.

5275
02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:46.380
He's not that good.

5276
02:34:46.381 --> 02:34:48.430
So to try to attribute anything to it,

5277
02:34:48.431 --> 02:34:48.660
I said,

5278
02:34:48.660 --> 02:34:50.490
I think it will be a little disingenuous.

5279
02:34:50.820 --> 02:34:51.630
So those uh,

5280
02:34:51.630 --> 02:34:56.250
archeologists that you know that are trying to figure what this thing out is,

5281
02:34:56.610 --> 02:34:57.510
it just gets it man.

5282
02:34:57.570 --> 02:35:00.150
Same sort of image is found all over the world.

5283
02:35:00.450 --> 02:35:03.020
It is that the image of the gray hair,

5284
02:35:03.170 --> 02:35:04.003
<v 4>right?</v>

5285
02:35:04.210 --> 02:35:05.990
Guy Image of the,

5286
02:35:05.991 --> 02:35:07.030
of the theory and throat,

5287
02:35:07.031 --> 02:35:10.390
which is the creature that's part human and part animal informed that is found,

5288
02:35:10.450 --> 02:35:12.310
that is found a wall all around the world.

5289
02:35:12.311 --> 02:35:16.480
Often I've seen virtually identical images in the painted caves in France and in

5290
02:35:16.481 --> 02:35:17.950
canyons in Utah for example.

5291
02:35:18.100 --> 02:35:21.610
<v 1>And you feel that that is directly related to psychedelic use,</v>

5292
02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:22.690
the spirit world.

5293
02:35:22.691 --> 02:35:24.580
And I think this is related to psychedelics as well.

5294
02:35:24.581 --> 02:35:26.050
I think that's a painting of a vision.

5295
02:35:26.460 --> 02:35:27.190
Um,

5296
02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:28.420
and the vision might've been,

5297
02:35:28.450 --> 02:35:28.721
you know,

5298
02:35:28.721 --> 02:35:29.590
not very clear,

5299
02:35:29.591 --> 02:35:29.900
but,

5300
02:35:29.900 --> 02:35:30.610
but that's what,

5301
02:35:30.610 --> 02:35:31.480
that's what's being paid.

5302
02:35:31.620 --> 02:35:35.260
I think somebody gave her three year old a colored rock and that's what the

5303
02:35:35.261 --> 02:35:36.094
true,

5304
02:35:36.220 --> 02:35:37.680
that's my three year old draws.

5305
02:35:37.690 --> 02:35:38.523
I'm telling you man.

5306
02:35:38.950 --> 02:35:39.783
Um,

5307
02:35:39.960 --> 02:35:40.321
the,

5308
02:35:40.321 --> 02:35:41.340
the idea of the,

5309
02:35:41.341 --> 02:35:42.051
the morphing,

5310
02:35:42.051 --> 02:35:42.730
right?

5311
02:35:42.730 --> 02:35:43.410
<v 4>If you,</v>

5312
02:35:43.410 --> 02:35:45.380
if you it Google call up,

5313
02:35:45.470 --> 02:35:48.680
call up show v Chauvet cave images for Chauvet cave.

5314
02:35:48.681 --> 02:35:50.110
I want Joe to see some beautiful images.

5315
02:35:50.350 --> 02:35:50.771
<v 1>Oh No,</v>

5316
02:35:50.771 --> 02:35:51.330
I will.

5317
02:35:51.330 --> 02:35:52.540
I will be very impressed.

5318
02:35:52.541 --> 02:35:55.810
I'm just joking around and being completely joking and silly,

5319
02:35:55.870 --> 02:35:56.411
but you're right.

5320
02:35:56.411 --> 02:35:56.750
That ain't me.

5321
02:35:56.750 --> 02:35:58.000
That image is rudimentary.

5322
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:59.560
What are the best images?

5323
02:35:59.590 --> 02:36:00.550
The best images,

5324
02:36:00.551 --> 02:36:03.430
depictions of aliens to you that you,

5325
02:36:03.710 --> 02:36:03.861
<v 4>well,</v>

5326
02:36:03.861 --> 02:36:04.520
first of all,

5327
02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:05.061
first of all,

5328
02:36:05.061 --> 02:36:05.420
let me,

5329
02:36:05.420 --> 02:36:06.740
let me make it clear.

5330
02:36:06.741 --> 02:36:08.420
I don't think that the,

5331
02:36:08.450 --> 02:36:10.480
that we're dealing with aliens,

5332
02:36:10.790 --> 02:36:12.490
quote unquote great.

5333
02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:12.951
I'm sorry.

5334
02:36:12.951 --> 02:36:13.784
I agree.

5335
02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:15.740
I think we're dealing with a mystery.

5336
02:36:15.741 --> 02:36:19.160
I think we're dealing with a phenomenon and I think we as a culture or certain

5337
02:36:19.161 --> 02:36:23.480
members of our culture or jumping to the conclusion that creatures a bit like us

5338
02:36:23.570 --> 02:36:28.160
perhaps looking slightly different in very high tech craft are crossing

5339
02:36:28.161 --> 02:36:29.180
interstellar space.

5340
02:36:29.181 --> 02:36:30.840
There's beautiful picture from Chavez.

5341
02:36:31.090 --> 02:36:34.730
So bad I crossing interstellar space and are coming here in technology.

5342
02:36:34.731 --> 02:36:35.990
But I personally think,

5343
02:36:35.991 --> 02:36:36.231
again,

5344
02:36:36.231 --> 02:36:36.891
I can't prove it,

5345
02:36:36.891 --> 02:36:40.670
but I think it's more likely we're dealing with interdimensional contacts that

5346
02:36:40.671 --> 02:36:40.941
these,

5347
02:36:40.941 --> 02:36:42.020
that these entities are,

5348
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:45.020
are not high tech aliens from a planet,

5349
02:36:45.021 --> 02:36:46.070
a bit like ours,

5350
02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:48.920
but they're coming to us from literally the other side of reality.

5351
02:36:49.270 --> 02:36:49.690
<v 1>Well,</v>

5352
02:36:49.690 --> 02:36:51.640
my unfortunate labeling aside,

5353
02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:52.210
um,

5354
02:36:52.210 --> 02:36:53.021
calling them aliens,

5355
02:36:53.021 --> 02:36:56.560
I meant that archetype that big that you say repeats itself over and over again

5356
02:36:56.890 --> 02:36:58.270
in Africa for example,

5357
02:36:58.360 --> 02:36:59.860
in the drag is the big mountains.

5358
02:37:00.370 --> 02:37:01.010
Just like that.

5359
02:37:01.010 --> 02:37:01.540
Is that the,

5360
02:37:01.540 --> 02:37:03.310
what's the best example we can pull up right now?

5361
02:37:03.311 --> 02:37:03.810
So we just,

5362
02:37:03.810 --> 02:37:05.290
I don't think you'd be able to pull this up.

5363
02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:05.651
No,

5364
02:37:05.651 --> 02:37:07.030
they don't have those images online.

5365
02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:07.871
You might,

5366
02:37:07.871 --> 02:37:08.591
you might find it.

5367
02:37:08.591 --> 02:37:10.180
I'm not sure thing is on the Internet.

5368
02:37:10.210 --> 02:37:13.060
I'm not sure I have it in my,

5369
02:37:13.061 --> 02:37:14.560
in my book supernatural.

5370
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:16.100
But what is the best one that's

5371
02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:17.360
<v 5>online in your opinion?</v>

5372
02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:18.500
I honestly couldn't tell you.

5373
02:37:18.501 --> 02:37:19.250
Okay.

5374
02:37:19.250 --> 02:37:20.570
I just wanted to get some,

5375
02:37:20.571 --> 02:37:22.940
I've seen some really fascinating ones.

5376
02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:23.470
Um,

5377
02:37:23.470 --> 02:37:24.020
uh,

5378
02:37:24.020 --> 02:37:26.420
one crazy shaman.

5379
02:37:26.690 --> 02:37:28.600
The where it's a [inaudible],

5380
02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:32.210
it's a very strange looking creature.

5381
02:37:32.211 --> 02:37:33.490
He looks like it could be

5382
02:37:34.210 --> 02:37:35.800
<v 4>Shalon Cave in Texas.</v>

5383
02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:36.310
Puzzling.

5384
02:37:36.310 --> 02:37:37.143
Is that what it is?

5385
02:37:37.390 --> 02:37:38.051
And those are his,

5386
02:37:38.051 --> 02:37:39.520
those native American depictions.

5387
02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:40.010
Soundness,

5388
02:37:40.010 --> 02:37:40.350
yeah.

5389
02:37:40.350 --> 02:37:40.510
Yeah.

5390
02:37:40.510 --> 02:37:41.870
But then you find similar things from,

5391
02:37:41.930 --> 02:37:42.970
from [inaudible] in,

5392
02:37:42.971 --> 02:37:43.804
in Algeria.

5393
02:37:44.270 --> 02:37:44.650
You know,

5394
02:37:44.650 --> 02:37:47.260
these kind of glowing figures that seem to,

5395
02:37:47.740 --> 02:37:49.540
it's very easy to construe them as,

5396
02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:51.400
as alien visitors from,

5397
02:37:51.430 --> 02:37:52.263
from other planets.

5398
02:37:52.820 --> 02:37:53.720
<v 5>So many drugs,</v>

5399
02:37:53.721 --> 02:37:58.490
like whether it's Iowaska or there's other ones that have archetypes that are

5400
02:37:58.491 --> 02:38:00.420
built in like snakes and you know,

5401
02:38:00.470 --> 02:38:01.303
Jaguars.

5402
02:38:01.430 --> 02:38:01.761
What do you,

5403
02:38:01.761 --> 02:38:02.740
what do you think that is?

5404
02:38:02.741 --> 02:38:05.690
Do you think that's the experiences of the people that have taken it before you?

5405
02:38:06.970 --> 02:38:07.211
<v 4>Well,</v>

5406
02:38:07.211 --> 02:38:07.571
first of all,

5407
02:38:07.571 --> 02:38:09.820
I don't think it's that we don't know what an archetype is,

5408
02:38:09.850 --> 02:38:10.170
right?

5409
02:38:10.170 --> 02:38:13.690
It's this idea that the human brain has all these patterns and shapes just built

5410
02:38:13.691 --> 02:38:14.051
into it.

5411
02:38:14.051 --> 02:38:19.051
Archetypally but I think just as easy just as possible is that there are other

5412
02:38:19.540 --> 02:38:23.980
levels of reality in which entities are able to look like that shape shifting

5413
02:38:23.981 --> 02:38:27.850
entities that can take on many different forms that the experience is very

5414
02:38:27.851 --> 02:38:28.684
universal.

5415
02:38:28.810 --> 02:38:29.471
For example,

5416
02:38:29.471 --> 02:38:31.060
everyone who drinks Iowasca,

5417
02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:31.840
um,

5418
02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:33.070
pretty much everyone,

5419
02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:34.480
if they persist with it,

5420
02:38:34.510 --> 02:38:39.510
we'll encounter serpents and those serpents aren't like your everyday sip and

5421
02:38:39.941 --> 02:38:40.240
you know,

5422
02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:44.360
the 500 feet long with no miles,

5423
02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:46.720
the size of cars and,

5424
02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:47.710
and um,

5425
02:38:48.550 --> 02:38:51.640
richly colored and colored and patterned and,

5426
02:38:51.700 --> 02:38:52.690
and intelligent,

5427
02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:53.351
you know.

5428
02:38:53.351 --> 02:38:57.400
Now why is it that somebody who drinks Iowasca in Tokyo and somebody who drinks

5429
02:38:57.401 --> 02:38:59.680
it in New York and somebody who drinks it in the Amazon,

5430
02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:03.810
that they all encounter these serpent intelligence serpent entities?

5431
02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:04.900
Fingerless well,

5432
02:39:04.901 --> 02:39:09.040
I think that there's something out there which chooses to manifest in that form.

5433
02:39:09.100 --> 02:39:13.810
And I think that it's being witnessed just as just as if I'm three different

5434
02:39:13.811 --> 02:39:17.530
explorers went into the jungle and met the same previously uncontacted con

5435
02:39:17.590 --> 02:39:19.930
uncontacted tribe and came back and drew us images.

5436
02:39:19.931 --> 02:39:21.490
And they think that there is some reality to it,

5437
02:39:21.491 --> 02:39:22.780
but I can't prove that.

5438
02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:24.760
I just think that that's what's,

5439
02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:25.930
that's what's going on.

5440
02:39:25.990 --> 02:39:27.640
And I've had enough in Canada,

5441
02:39:27.641 --> 02:39:29.550
so like Rick Strassman's work with DMT,

5442
02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:32.710
which I know that you're familiar with because you presented the Dmt,

5443
02:39:32.711 --> 02:39:34.600
the spirit molecule documentary,

5444
02:39:35.110 --> 02:39:40.110
you know that a number of his volunteers in counter entities who say to them,

5445
02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:44.080
we're so glad you've discovered this technology,

5446
02:39:44.410 --> 02:39:46.810
now we can communicate with you more often.

5447
02:39:46.970 --> 02:39:47.350
<v 5>Right?</v>

5448
02:39:47.350 --> 02:39:47.800
Yeah,

5449
02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:48.280
yeah,

5450
02:39:48.280 --> 02:39:48.920
yeah.

5451
02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:50.780
I always wonder about those trips,

5452
02:39:50.781 --> 02:39:54.470
whether or not that's just your imagination on hyperdrive creating these

5453
02:39:55.230 --> 02:39:57.380
impromptu right and proper that you should wonder about.

5454
02:39:57.400 --> 02:39:58.100
Yeah.

5455
02:39:58.100 --> 02:40:00.440
But there's also the possibility that no,

5456
02:40:00.441 --> 02:40:00.771
it's a,

5457
02:40:00.771 --> 02:40:02.090
you're communicating with something.

5458
02:40:02.091 --> 02:40:02.320
Yeah.

5459
02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:02.660
Yeah.

5460
02:40:02.660 --> 02:40:03.440
But either way,

5461
02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:03.771
again,

5462
02:40:03.771 --> 02:40:04.251
like we said,

5463
02:40:04.251 --> 02:40:05.120
it's the same experience.

5464
02:40:05.150 --> 02:40:05.450
Yeah.

5465
02:40:05.450 --> 02:40:05.780
Right.

5466
02:40:05.780 --> 02:40:06.470
Yeah.

5467
02:40:06.470 --> 02:40:07.340
You're a bad mother fucker.

5468
