00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.363
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the ces wrap up with young Jamie.</v>

3
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.030
<v Speaker 2>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you decided to go to the consumer</v>

5
00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 2>electronic show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this big gigantic expo that they have in</v>

6
00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Vegas every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the show for new computer,</v>

7
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.610
<v Speaker 2>gadget tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and like anything you'd see</v>

8
00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:31.420
<v Speaker 2>at like a fry's or best buy from all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way down to anything that'd be in a car.</v>

9
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Anything in a kitchen or anything in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bedroom?</v>

10
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Consumer electronics basically.</v>

11
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 2>So the show is essentially everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's coming out,</v>

12
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.090
<v Speaker 2>all the stuff that's on its way out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that have just been announced I</v>

13
00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:44.440
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I think most of the stuff</v>

14
00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:46.600
<v Speaker 2>that's supposed to be coming out for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sale this year.</v>

15
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some of it is,</v>

16
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.010
<v Speaker 2>we were just about to get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were like,</v>

17
00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:52.450
<v Speaker 2>God you got to say it for the podcast.</v>

18
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.330
<v Speaker 2>You were saying that some of it you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think they're kind of bullshitting.</v>

19
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.300
<v Speaker 2>I saw a lot of things that I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might not be ready or their</v>

20
00:00:58.301 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 2>prototypes and just like at a car show</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

21
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:01.780
<v Speaker 2>There are some things are just showing</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

22
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.570
<v Speaker 2>this is what we can do right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't even what's going to be</v>

23
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:05.950
<v Speaker 2>available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what we can do.</v>

24
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if there's a lot of interests will</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it.</v>

25
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.200
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this really cool laptop that</v>

26
00:01:11.201 --> 00:01:14.920
<v Speaker 2>has three screens on it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if the gaming laptop that you can get</v>

27
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.310
<v Speaker 2>some sort of crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were just prototypes to and two</v>

28
00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.890
<v Speaker 2>of them just got stolen last night or</v>
<v Speaker 2>two days ago.</v>

29
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 2>So they're trying to get at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take them back.</v>

30
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 2>So they stole prototypes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that could have even</v>

31
00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:28.710
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

32
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.583
<v Speaker 2>gross.</v>

33
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.080
<v Speaker 2>How gross to think that some nerds are</v>
<v Speaker 2>thieves,</v>

34
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you like to think that like</v>

35
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 2>whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

36
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.080
<v Speaker 2>whoever you have to be to be an</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovator in technology and electronics,</v>

37
00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:43.240
<v Speaker 2>you would have to be some super fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart guy.</v>

38
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.660
<v Speaker 2>You would think you'd just leave every</v>
<v Speaker 2>room open with people like that.</v>

39
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you like to think that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like.</v>

40
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure you'd like to.</v>

41
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.150
<v Speaker 2>But that's accounting world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of threw them,</v>

42
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

43
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.380
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm balls deep into house of cards right</v>

44
00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First season apparent.</v>

45
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:01.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many seasons.</v>

46
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:03.090
<v Speaker 2>It started in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

47
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

48
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.700
<v Speaker 2>There's three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three seasons.</v>

49
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:07.760
<v Speaker 2>I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

50
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:10.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So did they take a long time to make a</v>

51
00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:11.630
<v Speaker 2>season?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

52
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.400
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think they completed it and</v>

53
00:02:13.401 --> 00:02:15.530
<v Speaker 2>then they shot the whole thing then read</v>
<v Speaker 2>it again.</v>

54
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.290
<v Speaker 2>So there's a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

55
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 2>God Damn show dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A spoiler alert.</v>

56
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:21.410
<v Speaker 2>She anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you?</v>

57
00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:24.530
<v Speaker 2>Dare you send.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many episodes are there?</v>

58
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 2>You think it's probably 11 or 12 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>each one.</v>

59
00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:31.700
<v Speaker 2>So God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good show that Kevin Spacey's</v>

60
00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:33.400
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>

61
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good ups and</v>

62
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.450
<v Speaker 2>telling me that thing is just the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumbest shit ever is discussing a show.</v>

63
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

64
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.020
<v Speaker 2>like today in this day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you could talk about loss</v>

65
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:50.030
<v Speaker 2>because it was just on the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

66
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 2>when we were watching last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how recent this dvr thing and</v>

67
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:58.610
<v Speaker 2>this streaming thing has gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we were watching last.</v>

68
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't a long ago</v>

69
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody waited until it came on</v>

70
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 3>the next week and you could dvr it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you didn't.</v>

71
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 3>He didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bend Watch</v>

72
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.080
<v Speaker 4>wasn't there even that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

73
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.730
<v Speaker 4>they even did things that we had where</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would show like three episodes and</v>

74
00:03:11.731 --> 00:03:15.030
<v Speaker 4>then take a four week break and then to</v>
<v Speaker 4>show two more and then take another</v>

75
00:03:15.031 --> 00:03:16.890
<v Speaker 4>break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You remember how that would work.</v>

76
00:03:16.891 --> 00:03:19.320
<v Speaker 4>And then I think the writer's strike</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened in the middle of it too.</v>

77
00:03:19.321 --> 00:03:24.150
<v Speaker 4>So there was a longer gap too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I came into last.</v>

78
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.610
<v Speaker 3>Well I think I got the DVD of like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>

79
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.090
<v Speaker 3>the like when the second season was out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the first season.</v>

80
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.750
<v Speaker 3>I think that's how I got into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of trying to remember now.</v>

81
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.760
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoyed it up until the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll never forget this one moment.</v>

82
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.510
<v Speaker 3>There was this one moment where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were all standard around this pond and</v>

83
00:03:45.511 --> 00:03:49.050
<v Speaker 3>it was like some pond that like brings</v>
<v Speaker 3>you back to life or some shit like that.</v>

84
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.950
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what the scene was,</v>

85
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 3>but it was something insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're sitting there with their</v>

86
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 3>arms crossed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting for their turn to talk.</v>

87
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 3>Like the scene was so flat and fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

88
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

89
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 3>You guys are in front of a magical lake</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

90
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 3>You're not freaking out like this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how you respond.</v>

91
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:11.800
<v Speaker 3>And you just standing there with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>arms crossed,</v>

92
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 3>just do another merger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Glueck,</v>

93
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.000

<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

94
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:18.250
<v Speaker 3>I can't do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it anymore.</v>

95
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 3>Plus they killed Charlie</v>

96
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.860

<v Speaker 4>I was that Bonita that day as such.</v>

97
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 4>I was really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably the best episode of the</v>

98
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.030
<v Speaker 4>whole show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole.</v>

<v Speaker 4>remember seeing one or two westworld</v>
<v Speaker 4>people even up for anything.</v>

119
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.040
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of shitty.</v>

120
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.290
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they missed the nomination date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

121
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.840
<v Speaker 3>How could she not nominate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That show's awesome.</v>

122
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.490
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shows good.</v>

123
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.670
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

124
00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:42.090
<v Speaker 3>it just shows you if that is the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's just there's a lot of other</v>

125
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:45.540
<v Speaker 3>shows that are even more awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The we're just not aware of yet.</v>

126
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.300
<v Speaker 3>This seems like the Golden Age for TV</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows.</v>

127
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.160
<v Speaker 3>It really does.</v>

128
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.581
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The show.</v>

129
00:05:49.581 --> 00:05:51.590
<v Speaker 4>That one I hadn't heard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called the night manager.</v>

130
00:05:51.591 --> 00:05:54.080
<v Speaker 4>That one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a Hugh Laurie who used to be house.</v>

131
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.050
<v Speaker 4>He won an award for that and the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guy Tom Hiddleston when another word.</v>

132
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 4>Somebody was just telling me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone's short six,</v>

133
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 4>seven episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a Netflix thing,</v>

134
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:03.824
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

135
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 4>It might be on Netflix now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it was on something else to</v>

136
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:07.663
<v Speaker 4>originally.</v>

137
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 3>This is an amazing time for television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about all the great shows.</v>

138
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.010
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen the OAA yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I keep hearing that.</v>

139
00:06:15.011 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good too.</v>

140
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to even want to say what</v>

141
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:21.990
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

142
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 3>you're not even supposed to know too</v>
<v Speaker 3>much about it before you watch it.</v>

143
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 3>That's the best way to do this.</v>

144
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.010
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A good way to go.</v>

145
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 3>Like stranger things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know shit about stranger things</v>

146
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 3>until I jumped in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know a goddamn thing.</v>

147
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.110
<v Speaker 4>I still haven't got play on it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah,</v>

148
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>

149
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 4>Don't let.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't let red band steer you wrong.</v>

150
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.960
<v Speaker 4>It's some things to see you just see a</v>
<v Speaker 4>tweet some time to just what's in your</v>

151
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is about the day</v>

152
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 4>you see it or the timing was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck that show.</v>

153
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 4>So He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen it.</v>

154
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:54.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't care how it would have been</v>
<v Speaker 4>awesome if you hit play,</v>

155
00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:59.180
<v Speaker 4>but somebody says just it's the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing you heard about it and now you're</v>

156
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:00.560
<v Speaker 4>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

157
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 4>And then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

158
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 4>sometimes you watch it and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>surprised.</v>

159
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know how often that happens</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're surprised on some.</v>

160
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:07.424
<v Speaker 4>You see,</v>

161
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard to tell because people's</v>
<v Speaker 3>tastes vary so much.</v>

162
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like they're watching</v>
<v Speaker 3>something different than you</v>

163
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.810
<v Speaker 3>who you are like as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life experiences and what that show</v>

164
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.510
<v Speaker 3>means to you when you're watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so different for all of us.</v>

165
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.670
<v Speaker 3>Like for each one of us is different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's weird about televisions.</v>

166
00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:34.750
<v Speaker 3>What's weird about books and music and</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy and pretty much everything.</v>

167
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.920
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not one universal awesome thing.</v>

168
00:07:38.921 --> 00:07:40.960
<v Speaker 3>There's some shit that like everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>

169
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:42.690
<v Speaker 3>God down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good no matter what [inaudible]</v>

170
00:07:42.691 --> 00:07:44.900
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Michael Jackson and his prime.</v>

171
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember there was this radio station</v>

172
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:49.300
<v Speaker 3>in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

173
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

174
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.101
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

175
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:57.101
<v Speaker 3>pretty sure it was wbcn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was either wbcn or Wcio Z.</v>

176
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.820
<v Speaker 3>Those are like the two rock stations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coc was a little harder.</v>

177
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Speaker 3>If you're a nosy person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were like a little bit more into</v>

178
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 3>like Metallica a little harder.</v>

179
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And bcn.</v>

180
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it's bcn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They played a Michael Jackson song and</v>

181
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 3>Dez back when Djs could just play music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

182
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.370
<v Speaker 3>was a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could just play whatever they</v>

183
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:24.740
<v Speaker 3>wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could just like as if you were a DJ</v>

184
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:27.840
<v Speaker 3>right now and you had a bunch of records</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you had an internet radio station.</v>

185
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.660
<v Speaker 3>If they let you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can,</v>

186
00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 3>but if they did let you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just play those records.</v>

187
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm play whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't exist anymore.</v>

188
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this dude,</v>

189
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:43.631
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could remember who it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just started playing this Michael</v>

190
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.051
<v Speaker 3>Jackson Song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

191
00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:47.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't care why you like this is great</v>
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>

192
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:50.743
<v Speaker 4>You don't remember the song?</v>

193
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Sure was Billie Jean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

194
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:59.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it was billy Jean because that</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't that all off a thriller was</v>

195
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:06.051
<v Speaker 3>Billie Jean on thriller to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard,</v>

196
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 3>I think for people today because there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many superstars,</v>

197
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 3>there's so many different venues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's people that are</v>

198
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:15.710
<v Speaker 3>superstars just from the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

199
00:09:15.711 --> 00:09:17.160
<v Speaker 3>it was on thriller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

200
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.360
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think today I think there's a much,</v>

201
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 3>much larger number of celebrities and</v>
<v Speaker 3>have super celebrities,</v>

202
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of beyond ses and Jay z and Kanye</v>

203
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.370
<v Speaker 3>West's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many of those now that it,</v>

204
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.530
<v Speaker 3>it kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

205
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>

206
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we can appreciate today</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it was like when Michael Jackson</v>

207
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:44.870
<v Speaker 3>was in his heyday because there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

208
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was one,</v>

209
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.340
<v Speaker 3>it was one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was one guy that just boom,</v>

210
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.410
<v Speaker 3>there was no one like Michael Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one guy who had so much impact on the</v>

211
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:58.710
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were wearing those stupid jackets</v>

212
00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 3>everywhere and dancing that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

213
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.620
<v Speaker 3>Corey Feldman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Corey Feldman and Corey Haim,</v>

214
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:07.380
<v Speaker 3>the two of them would go out and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were buddies with Michael Jackson,</v>

215
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:09.150
<v Speaker 3>so they would dress like him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>

216
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 3>it was a serious trend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

217
00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.730
<v Speaker 3>People wanted a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was that trend and there was the</v>

218
00:10:15.731 --> 00:10:18.470
<v Speaker 3>other one with the hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smooth criminal,</v>

219
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.350
<v Speaker 3>there was a little bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people were one glove.</v>

220
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.310
<v Speaker 3>Was that a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

221
00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:23.390
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

222
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:26.710
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

223
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.640
<v Speaker 3>I think it's hard for us to appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 3>how crazy that was with no internet,</v>

224
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.210
<v Speaker 3>just television stations and radio</v>
<v Speaker 3>stations</v>

225
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:42.070
<v Speaker 3>and much less people on the planet</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's even weirder.</v>

226
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:48.110
<v Speaker 3>So what do we have like 100 million more</v>
<v Speaker 3>people than when I was a kid.</v>

227
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.100
<v Speaker 3>What was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the,</v>

228
00:10:51.101 --> 00:10:54.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find out what the population was in 1980</v>

229
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.310
<v Speaker 3>in the United States because that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been when I was like 13</v>

230
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:07.180
<v Speaker 3>because I was in high school in</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 81 to 226 point $5 million.</v>

231
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.900
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred million more people here</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

232
00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:16.430
<v Speaker 3>$100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Million more people here than when I was</v>

233
00:11:16.431 --> 00:11:19.640
<v Speaker 3>a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking bananas.</v>

234
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an insane number</v>

235
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:32.160
<v Speaker 3>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really hard to imagine.</v>

236
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:37.190
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to imagine you stop and</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about what that means for another</v>

237
00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:43.130
<v Speaker 3>30 or 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's going to go up another 100</v>

238
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.810
<v Speaker 3>million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are we going to put all these</v>

239
00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:49.370
<v Speaker 3>fucking people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they say that it peaks off</v>

240
00:11:49.371 --> 00:11:51.200
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

241
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:56.230
<v Speaker 3>when cities and start doing better</v>
<v Speaker 3>because then they start having less</v>

242
00:11:56.561 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 3>children because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

243
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:03.660
<v Speaker 3>there economic situation turns up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then a lot of women get careers and</v>

244
00:12:04.081 --> 00:12:07.980
<v Speaker 3>they're more reluctant to give up those</v>
<v Speaker 3>careers to have children and they have</v>

245
00:12:07.981 --> 00:12:09.750
<v Speaker 3>less children when they do have</v>
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>

246
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:15.470
<v Speaker 3>And so they think that if you look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the trends towards urbanization,</v>

247
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.280
<v Speaker 3>there could potentially be a time in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future where we worried about a decline</v>

248
00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:22.320
<v Speaker 3>in population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a natural decline.</v>

249
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.900
<v Speaker 3>But it sounds like horse shit to me.</v>

250
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.470
<v Speaker 5>I've heard that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like Porsche,</v>

251
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.090
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I've heard it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's happening now that it's not</v>

252
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.460
<v Speaker 5>that we've almost not peaked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

253
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.130
<v Speaker 5>it's on a decline in some places for</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

254
00:12:35.131 --> 00:12:35.964
<v Speaker 5>I think I've read.</v>

255
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.810
<v Speaker 3>I think people are just moving out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those spots and coming here.</v>

256
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.340
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's obvious there's more people now</v>

257
00:12:43.341 --> 00:12:44.900
<v Speaker 3>than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a trend.</v>

258
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.980
<v Speaker 3>It's 100 million trend in the last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was.</v>

259
00:12:48.981 --> 00:12:49.970
<v Speaker 3>Thirty plus years.</v>

260
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.350
<v Speaker 5>I wish I was trying to pull it up right</v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

261
00:12:51.351 --> 00:12:56.351
<v Speaker 5>I just saw an article yesterday maybe</v>
<v Speaker 5>about how many houses are needed in Los</v>

262
00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.780
<v Speaker 5>Angeles to keep up with the housing</v>
<v Speaker 5>required in 100,000 houses a year.</v>

263
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:01.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

264
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 3>They have to build a 100,000 houses a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

265
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.073
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's like,</v>

266
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.090
<v Speaker 5>that's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

267
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:08.320
<v Speaker 5>that's insane.</v>

268
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:10.973
<v Speaker 2>Because there's no room.</v>

269
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:17.830
<v Speaker 3>I did this thing before my showtime</v>
<v Speaker 3>special in 2005 where I was comparing</v>

270
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.540
<v Speaker 3>like mountains and lakes and rivers to</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you see when you see a city,</v>

271
00:13:25.541 --> 00:13:28.930
<v Speaker 3>how it looks like a growth and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of other gross,</v>

272
00:13:28.931 --> 00:13:31.750
<v Speaker 3>like even if you burn it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you got to burn it all off.</v>

273
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:35.740
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise it just comes back and it gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger and stronger and if you could</v>

274
00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:38.530
<v Speaker 3>look at it as something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you were outside of</v>

275
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:45.730
<v Speaker 3>our understandings and our knowledge of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what cities are and people and languages</v>

276
00:13:46.611 --> 00:13:50.390
<v Speaker 3>and communities and cultures and if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could look past all that,</v>

277
00:13:50.391 --> 00:13:53.660
<v Speaker 3>you'd look at these things that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing on this planet.</v>

278
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:59.080
<v Speaker 3>He'd look at this concrete weird fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>growth and when you break it out,</v>

279
00:14:00.411 --> 00:14:03.530
<v Speaker 3>if that's a real number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we need 100,000 houses a year,</v>

280
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.230
<v Speaker 5>I saw this picture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was on reddit yesterday or the</v>

281
00:14:07.231 --> 00:14:09.750
<v Speaker 5>other day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is a 60 square foot flat.</v>

282
00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.430
<v Speaker 5>It says in Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe.</v>

283
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.440
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

284
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.390
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's basically people that I look.</v>

285
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how many.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is two people living in here.</v>

286
00:14:17.341 --> 00:14:18.390
<v Speaker 5>It looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least to.</v>

287
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.160
<v Speaker 5>This is like a closet</v>

288
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.200
<v Speaker 3>and every time the closet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is in there.</v>

289
00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:26.290
<v Speaker 3>The tiny little refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tiny little sink.</v>

290
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.150
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>

291
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just sleeping on bunk beds.</v>

292
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

293
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.310
<v Speaker 3>It's just this is not good for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

294
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.320
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would people choose to do.</v>

295
00:14:39.321 --> 00:14:42.890
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you weren't a person and you were</v>

296
00:14:42.891 --> 00:14:44.470
<v Speaker 3>looking at this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

297
00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:47.100
<v Speaker 3>why don't they spread out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't they spread out?</v>

298
00:14:47.101 --> 00:14:49.500
<v Speaker 3>What are they doing in themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they like it like this?</v>

299
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.690
<v Speaker 3>Does they have to be there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A</v>

300
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:54.310
<v Speaker 2>family keeps them there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the city or like from keeping for</v>

301
00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.930
<v Speaker 2>moving to Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we can only speculate,</v>

302
00:14:56.931 --> 00:14:57.350
<v Speaker 2>but I think</v>

303
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.720
<v Speaker 3>the population in Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking bananas.</v>

304
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.593
<v Speaker 3>It's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

305
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.860
<v Speaker 3>There's just too many fucking people</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

306
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

307
00:15:04.791 --> 00:15:06.860
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just weirds me out.</v>

308
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.660
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at people like a</v>

309
00:15:08.661 --> 00:15:11.960
<v Speaker 3>mathematical thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't just look at him like,</v>

310
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:13.580
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my friend Jamie.</v>

311
00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:14.601
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

312
00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:16.370
<v Speaker 3>that's this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know that guy.</v>

313
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:17.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy is cool.</v>

314
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.220
<v Speaker 3>Instead of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just looking at like math.</v>

315
00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:24.221
<v Speaker 3>Let's just look at the sheer volume.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then watch it as it multiplies and</v>

316
00:15:24.831 --> 00:15:28.070
<v Speaker 3>continues to multiply in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one multiplies and keeps going and</v>

317
00:15:28.071 --> 00:15:31.640
<v Speaker 3>going and then the people move here and</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiply and it's all multiplication.</v>

318
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:33.161
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>

319
00:15:33.161 --> 00:15:33.591
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>

320
00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:33.981
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>

321
00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:38.981
<v Speaker 3>we're not planning this out or oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just stack it up.</v>

322
00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:43.490
<v Speaker 3>Fucking houses weighted mean it's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get to a point where there's nothing</v>

323
00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:47.980
<v Speaker 3>else but houses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we keep going,</v>

324
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand why people think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's totally sustainable by the way.</v>

325
00:15:53.801 --> 00:15:55.180
<v Speaker 3>That's coming from someone with three</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>

326
00:15:55.181 --> 00:15:56.380
<v Speaker 3>So I should probably shut the fuck up.</v>

327
00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.673
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

328
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.270
<v Speaker 2>have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you gotten further into Black</v>

329
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.850
<v Speaker 2>Mirror yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

330
00:16:01.851 --> 00:16:03.550
<v Speaker 2>just two episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just did two.</v>

331
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.170
<v Speaker 2>I will go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will watch more,</v>

332
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.310
<v Speaker 2>but I really enjoyed the memory one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the one that you kept telling</v>

333
00:16:10.311 --> 00:16:10.850
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saying?</v>

334
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:11.683
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

335
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Well they had an awesome take on it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the um,</v>

336
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to spoiler alert anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

337
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.313
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

338
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:24.320
<v Speaker 3>they were able to record their memories</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what we've been talking about</v>

339
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:26.870
<v Speaker 3>that for years that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

340
00:16:26.871 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about that because it's pretty</v>

341
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.100
<v Speaker 3>obvious transition between being able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>record memories with your phone,</v>

342
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.930
<v Speaker 3>which is essentially that's what a felon</v>
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>

343
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.170
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're taking photos and videos and</v>

344
00:16:39.171 --> 00:16:43.140
<v Speaker 3>stuff from your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you recording memories and how long</v>

345
00:16:43.141 --> 00:16:45.960
<v Speaker 3>before it's somewhere where you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>play it on your brain.</v>

346
00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.050
<v Speaker 3>I could see it in your head and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

347
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:49.933
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>

348
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.480
<v Speaker 3>we think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

349
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.640
<v Speaker 3>I would love to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there is a way that they can even</v>

350
00:16:58.861 --> 00:17:02.840
<v Speaker 3>take photos that way because I know they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can transfer images.</v>

351
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.980
<v Speaker 3>They can transfer like an image into</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's mind now.</v>

352
00:17:06.981 --> 00:17:11.120
<v Speaker 3>Like in like very like simple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a triangle and you see a triangle.</v>

353
00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:13.630
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that in that the latest</v>

354
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:15.390
<v Speaker 2>sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's still a.</v>

355
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.793
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

356
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.720
<v Speaker 2>I know you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

357
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.200
<v Speaker 2>and there was one where they were able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to transmit a word through the Internet.</v>

358
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was more like a one and zero thing.</v>

359
00:17:26.351 --> 00:17:28.870
<v Speaker 2>It was like on or off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like are you feeling and not kind of</v>

360
00:17:28.871 --> 00:17:29.800
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

361
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.490
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was an actual word or</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten into what a word is spelled that</v>

362
00:17:33.491 --> 00:17:34.660
<v Speaker 2>they might have spelled out the word.</v>

363
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it was a spelled out</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

364
00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.920
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could remember the explanation</v>
<v Speaker 3>they gave for it,</v>

365
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.460
<v Speaker 3>but I think it was like what that word</v>
<v Speaker 3>represents,</v>

366
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

367
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:50.390
<v Speaker 3>So the intent of that word</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like so the person on the other</v>

368
00:17:50.391 --> 00:17:51.800
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I knew the word,</v>

369
00:17:51.801 --> 00:17:55.370
<v Speaker 3>like know or knew the word not or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the word was</v>

370
00:17:55.850 --> 00:18:00.850
<v Speaker 4>says they were able to send the words</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ola and chow from Indian France subjects</v>

371
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.720
<v Speaker 4>solve messages of flashes of light in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the peripheral vision.</v>

372
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.540
<v Speaker 3>The results described as remarkable step</v>
<v Speaker 3>in human communication.</v>

373
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:14.570
<v Speaker 3>Who that is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sending messages through the</v>

374
00:18:18.111 --> 00:18:20.890
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were able to send the words,</v>

375
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.860
<v Speaker 3>scroll up a little bit back where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were.</v>

376
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.730
<v Speaker 3>They were able to send the words Olan</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chow from a location in India to</v>

377
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:31.280
<v Speaker 3>location and France transmitted signals</v>
<v Speaker 3>directly.</v>

378
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.030
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is nuts.</v>

379
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.440
<v Speaker 3>It's just hard to imagine</v>
<v Speaker 3>how far that could go.</v>

380
00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.470
<v Speaker 3>You know they can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

381
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.400
<v Speaker 3>What I've been thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sounds like total bananas,</v>

382
00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:51.000
<v Speaker 3>but I've really been thinking a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it lately is that you don't have</v>

383
00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:53.570
<v Speaker 3>the internet kind of allows everybody to</v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate together.</v>

384
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.100
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have your twitter account and</v>

385
00:18:55.101 --> 00:19:00.020
<v Speaker 3>your facebook and all that jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like what's gonna happen with</v>

386
00:19:00.021 --> 00:19:04.640
<v Speaker 3>this kind of technology and this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>hive mind technology.</v>

387
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:10.570
<v Speaker 3>It's if they can transmit signals from</v>
<v Speaker 3>one person to another person through the</v>

388
00:19:10.761 --> 00:19:12.740
<v Speaker 3>brain with with this technology.</v>

389
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:18.280
<v Speaker 3>This is real similar to like when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>first started putting things on message</v>

390
00:19:18.281 --> 00:19:22.210
<v Speaker 3>boards and the Internet and bulletin</v>
<v Speaker 3>boards and like someone would put it up</v>

391
00:19:22.211 --> 00:19:25.330
<v Speaker 3>and then you'd have to check it and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the only method of communication.</v>

392
00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.700
<v Speaker 3>Like my friend Andrew's talked to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>about that a lot.</v>

393
00:19:27.701 --> 00:19:32.701
<v Speaker 3>He was on in the really early days of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet and those se bulletin</v>

394
00:19:33.191 --> 00:19:37.810
<v Speaker 3>boards were really primitive and this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the first things that people had</v>

395
00:19:37.811 --> 00:19:41.530
<v Speaker 3>devised to communicate with online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now here we are 20 years later and</v>

396
00:19:41.531 --> 00:19:45.730
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're streaming live on instagram and</v>

397
00:19:45.731 --> 00:19:49.270
<v Speaker 3>you're doing facebook live and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are taking pictures</v>

398
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:54.271
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously uploading them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna they're gonna be able to</v>

399
00:19:54.311 --> 00:19:58.690
<v Speaker 3>some way somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another allow us to interface with our</v>

400
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:03.700
<v Speaker 3>brain's the same way we interfaced using</v>
<v Speaker 3>these phones and using computers.</v>

401
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.150
<v Speaker 4>I was just a way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that happens,</v>

402
00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.043
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

403
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how this work.</v>

404
00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:12.550
<v Speaker 4>This obviously was a two way</v>
<v Speaker 4>communication.</v>

405
00:20:12.551 --> 00:20:16.630
<v Speaker 4>They're both wanting it to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In this scenario you're bringing up</v>

406
00:20:16.631 --> 00:20:17.590
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if a,</v>

407
00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.470
<v Speaker 4>you sent me a message I didn't want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will or I didn't want to have right</v>

408
00:20:20.471 --> 00:20:22.270
<v Speaker 4>then I didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now I'm busy,</v>

409
00:20:22.271 --> 00:20:25.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing something else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or You just blasting me with this</v>

410
00:20:25.961 --> 00:20:26.480
<v Speaker 4>message.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

411
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.020
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

412
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:27.750
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wake up,</v>

413
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.020
<v Speaker 4>wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to come to sleep.</v>

414
00:20:29.021 --> 00:20:32.730
<v Speaker 4>Or who knows what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or I'm getting 10 messages from all</v>

415
00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:34.690
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting spam messages from outside</v>

416
00:20:34.691 --> 00:20:36.880
<v Speaker 4>too because they're going to be a way to</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn it off.</v>

417
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're probably going to be able</v>

418
00:20:40.371 --> 00:20:42.860
<v Speaker 3>to opt out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how many people are going to opt out</v>

419
00:20:42.861 --> 00:20:43.460
<v Speaker 3>of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

420
00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.010
<v Speaker 3>and even if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you could turn it off airplane</v>

421
00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:46.844
<v Speaker 3>mode,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

422
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 3>and like you do what your phone</v>

423
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.550
<v Speaker 6>at night if you're watching a TV show or</v>
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>

424
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:57.210
<v Speaker 6>I think that if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're really gonna keep going with</v>

425
00:20:57.461 --> 00:21:02.461
<v Speaker 6>this and it seems like they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean if they're doing things like</v>

426
00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:04.480
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not going to stop right there.</v>

427
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:05.670
<v Speaker 6>It's not going well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We did it.</v>

428
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.610
<v Speaker 6>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's just leave it there.</v>

429
00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.410
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there they have these new batteries.</v>

430
00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.100
<v Speaker 6>Have you seen these new fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>batteries that uh,</v>

431
00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.970
<v Speaker 6>they're powering with nuclear waste?</v>

432
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.223
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

433
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the last for like 5,000 years.</v>

434
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.450
<v Speaker 2>I did see that Tesla's factory got</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned on and they started making</v>

435
00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:26.620
<v Speaker 2>batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

436
00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was something about batteries</v>

437
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:32.170
<v Speaker 2>being made with nuclear waste.</v>

438
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.280
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

439
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.630
<v Speaker 2>diamond battery made from nuclear ladies</v>
<v Speaker 2>can last more than 5,000 years.</v>

440
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put that in a cell phone and put it</v>

441
00:21:46.721 --> 00:21:51.580
<v Speaker 2>right next to your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shouldn't hurt him at all because</v>

442
00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:54.610
<v Speaker 2>radioactive sources in case safely</v>
<v Speaker 2>within the diamond,</v>

443
00:21:54.611 --> 00:21:57.490
<v Speaker 2>the hardest known substance it would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe to use.</v>

444
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Say the researchers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck those guys.</v>

445
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.190
<v Speaker 2>They're going to open up a port to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those guys from halflife.</v>

446
00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

447
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.000
<v Speaker 2>You're going to put what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know the chicks are going to</v>

448
00:22:10.001 --> 00:22:14.350
<v Speaker 2>want God damn nuclear diamond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know those really super fucking high</v>

449
00:22:14.351 --> 00:22:17.050
<v Speaker 2>maintenance checks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all gonna want nuclear diamonds,</v>

450
00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.600
<v Speaker 2>like a regular diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not going to be good enough.</v>

451
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:24.670
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be the next top level</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit is a diamond with nuclear waste</v>

452
00:22:24.671 --> 00:22:29.671
<v Speaker 2>inside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see this a cremation diamonds.</v>

453
00:22:30.521 --> 00:22:32.550
<v Speaker 2>People are being cremated and turned</v>
<v Speaker 2>into diamonds.</v>

454
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful.</v>

455
00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:37.270
<v Speaker 2>So what that those two things possibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>related.</v>

456
00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.020
<v Speaker 2>It's cremations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird ways and you were probably fucked</v>

457
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.740
<v Speaker 6>can over nature by being cremated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We really are.</v>

458
00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:48.310
<v Speaker 6>We're probably fucking over nature also</v>
<v Speaker 6>with a formaldehyde.</v>

459
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.170
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's some,</v>

460
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.920
<v Speaker 6>that's probably one of the disconnects</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we have with nature,</v>

461
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:58.030
<v Speaker 6>like we don't absorb into it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't,</v>

462
00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.120
<v Speaker 6>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we don't just bury our dead and then let</v>

463
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:05.450
<v Speaker 6>the body do its natural decomposing</v>
<v Speaker 6>process and then become a part of the</v>

464
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.760
<v Speaker 6>natural ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now we've completely removed ourselves</v>

465
00:23:09.761 --> 00:23:11.560
<v Speaker 6>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We take the body,</v>

466
00:23:11.561 --> 00:23:16.561
<v Speaker 6>we drain all the shit out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We fill it up with chemicals we spray.</v>

467
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.110
<v Speaker 6>Painted is weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you seen a body like that's about</v>

468
00:23:20.111 --> 00:23:20.944
<v Speaker 6>to be buried?</v>

469
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Not for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

470
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:25.840
<v Speaker 2>my grandpa freaked me out</v>

471
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:27.751
<v Speaker 6>cause I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

472
00:23:27.751 --> 00:23:29.220
<v Speaker 6>he's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

473
00:23:29.221 --> 00:23:31.290
<v Speaker 6>this is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It didn't,</v>

474
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.290
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was nothing good about it.</v>

475
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.960
<v Speaker 6>It was nothing good about being there</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>

476
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:41.520
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to use the words grotesque,</v>

477
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:47.120
<v Speaker 6>but there is something severely damaged</v>
<v Speaker 6>about the idea behind it.</v>

478
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:50.940
<v Speaker 6>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my God.</v>

479
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:55.670
<v Speaker 6>I felt like I was watching some crazy</v>
<v Speaker 6>ritualistic shit.</v>

480
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.480
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was like reenacted from the</v>

481
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.210
<v Speaker 6>primitive days of early man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

482
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:06.730
<v Speaker 6>looking down at this spray painted shell</v>
<v Speaker 6>of a human,</v>

483
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:09.410
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's bizarre man.</v>

484
00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.360
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could tell that's not.</v>

485
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.690
<v Speaker 6>He's not really there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is this?</v>

486
00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:17.970
<v Speaker 6>These are different funerals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does it say?</v>

487
00:24:17.971 --> 00:24:20.610
<v Speaker 6>Puerto Rican gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Puerto Rico gangster.</v>

488
00:24:20.611 --> 00:24:23.400
<v Speaker 6>Propped up playing dominoes at his</v>
<v Speaker 6>funeral.</v>

489
00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:26.120
<v Speaker 6>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As Superhero.</v>

<v Speaker 6>This guy's in a car.</v>

491
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.790
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is crazy.</v>

492
00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:35.310
<v Speaker 6>I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've had like different disguises.</v>

493
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:39.060
<v Speaker 6>Here's a boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

494
00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.360
<v Speaker 6>He's a boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they put him in his</v>

495
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.050
<v Speaker 6>warm up suit and they put them in a</v>
<v Speaker 6>corner of a ring.</v>

496
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.150
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is crazy.</v>

497
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.370

<v Speaker 6>I want you have sunglasses and you read</v>

498
00:24:51.371 --> 00:24:55.260
<v Speaker 6>about the fight and</v>
<v Speaker 6>want to see a crazy fucking picture.</v>

499
00:24:55.261 --> 00:25:00.261
<v Speaker 6>That Guy Joseph Smith Jr who just</v>
<v Speaker 6>knocked out Bernard Hopkins first day on</v>

500
00:25:00.571 --> 00:25:05.571
<v Speaker 6>the job since he won the world title and</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's got a photo of themselves,</v>

501
00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:09.810
<v Speaker 6>a Gi Joe Smith Jr.</v>

502
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:19.760
<v Speaker 6>He's got to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's got two instagrams where I saw it.</v>

503
00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.030
<v Speaker 6>Maybe cHabad it up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

504
00:25:22.031 --> 00:25:24.070
<v Speaker 6>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at that.</v>

505
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.610
<v Speaker 6>Joe smith's first day on the job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Since he one.</v>

506
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.710
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this guy just knocked out bernard</v>

507
00:25:29.711 --> 00:25:32.680
<v Speaker 6>hopkins and he has a construction worker</v>
<v Speaker 6>job.</v>

508
00:25:32.681 --> 00:25:35.350
<v Speaker 6>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's insane.</v>

509
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.810
<v Speaker 6>that's insane.</v>

510
00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:40.600
<v Speaker 6>Hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quit that job.</v>

511
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.490
<v Speaker 6>As I say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you think at this point he needs to</v>

512
00:25:42.491 --> 00:25:44.560
<v Speaker 6>do that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how much you got paid,</v>

513
00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he might just be a and have another</v>

514
00:25:46.721 --> 00:25:48.760
<v Speaker 6>fight lined up or.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

515
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.780
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think everyone would just assume that</v>

516
00:25:52.781 --> 00:25:54.970
<v Speaker 6>if someone's world champion that they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>rIch,</v>

517
00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.720
<v Speaker 6>but it's not really the case.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to be a famous world champion.</v>

518
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:00.311
<v Speaker 6>the real,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the money.</v>

519
00:26:00.311 --> 00:26:02.680
<v Speaker 6>I Mean the money's in promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The money is in,</v>

520
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.840
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a guy like oscar de la hoya in his</v>

521
00:26:04.841 --> 00:26:07.000
<v Speaker 6>prime.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was a,</v>

522
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:12.030
<v Speaker 6>like a teen idol and also an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 6>boxer or olympiC gold medalist that</v>

523
00:26:12.641 --> 00:26:15.640
<v Speaker 6>kinda guy sold tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Floyd mayweather sells tickets.</v>

524
00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:19.810
<v Speaker 6>Mandy pack out sells tickets</v>
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>

525
00:26:19.811 --> 00:26:21.970
<v Speaker 6>Joe smith jr.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His next fight will probably make a lot</v>

526
00:26:21.971 --> 00:26:22.990
<v Speaker 6>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

527
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:26.950
<v Speaker 6>this was an opportunity for him and he</v>
<v Speaker 6>capitalized on it and he knocked out one</v>

528
00:26:26.951 --> 00:26:29.740
<v Speaker 6>of the greatest of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it was</v>

529
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.930
<v Speaker 6>just weird to see them working.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

530
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.210
<v Speaker 6>that fight was fucked though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know what rounded that happened in</v>

531
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.560
<v Speaker 6>like the fourth or the fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember.</v>

532
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.180
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>

533
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:50.340
<v Speaker 3>he had been getting to bernard hopkins</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it looked like one of those classic</v>

534
00:26:50.341 --> 00:26:54.300
<v Speaker 3>fights where the old veteran just as</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost a step,</v>

535
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was getting to bernard hopkins,</v>

536
00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.060
<v Speaker 3>he tagged when some big shots and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he got him in the corner and just</v>

537
00:27:00.061 --> 00:27:03.330
<v Speaker 3>unloaded those shots on him and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>bernard fell back on his head.</v>

538
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:04.441
<v Speaker 3>I was Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>

539
00:27:04.441 --> 00:27:08.730
<v Speaker 3>this is just so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just such a fucked up way to end an</v>

540
00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:13.440
<v Speaker 3>amazing career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan is just what that sport does,</v>

541
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.770
<v Speaker 3>does what that sport does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no getting around that.</v>

542
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:22.070
<v Speaker 3>If you're a 51 year old band and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to fight one of the best young</v>

543
00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:23.640
<v Speaker 3>lions in the game.</v>

544
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.420
<v Speaker 3>Especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not on pds or anything.</v>

545
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:28.930
<v Speaker 3>He's not on any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

546
00:27:28.931 --> 00:27:30.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he is.</v>

547
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.980
<v Speaker 3>He might be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I doubt it.</v>

548
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.570
<v Speaker 3>He seems like Just a super disciplined</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy and his body sort of reflectS that.</v>

549
00:27:36.571 --> 00:27:39.030
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't quite have the same body that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had when he was younger,</v>

550
00:27:39.031 --> 00:27:41.610
<v Speaker 3>but he still looked very fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when he was younger,</v>

551
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:45.000
<v Speaker 3>he was a savage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when he beat like felix trinidad,</v>

552
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.640
<v Speaker 3>nobody gave him a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody thought he was done.</v>

553
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:50.550
<v Speaker 3>They thought he was old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel extremely.</v>

554
00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.330
<v Speaker 3>That was going to fuck him up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he went on to fight for like 13 more</v>

555
00:27:54.331 --> 00:27:55.164
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

556
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:59.431
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

557
00:27:59.431 --> 00:28:00.810
<v Speaker 3>he fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kelly pavlock,</v>

558
00:28:00.811 --> 00:28:04.800
<v Speaker 3>they thought he was old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he went to fight kelly pavlick and</v>

559
00:28:04.801 --> 00:28:05.401
<v Speaker 3>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

560
00:28:05.401 --> 00:28:07.500
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be a bad fight for</v>
<v Speaker 3>bernard hopkins.</v>

561
00:28:07.501 --> 00:28:08.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

562
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was 39 or something like</v>

563
00:28:11.041 --> 00:28:12.180
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget how old he was.</v>

564
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.103
<v Speaker 3>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>

565
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Might've been a little younger than</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

566
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.110
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fucked up.</v>

567
00:28:16.111 --> 00:28:17.490
<v Speaker 3>Kelly pavlik.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

568
00:28:17.491 --> 00:28:22.491
<v Speaker 3>he was in his forties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find out how old bernard hopkins was</v>

569
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:26.700
<v Speaker 3>when he fought kelly pavlik after</v>
<v Speaker 3>pavlock had already become the champ.</v>

570
00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:27.660
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

571
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:33.420
<v Speaker 3>I want to say he pavlock had beaten</v>
<v Speaker 3>jermaine taylor.</v>

572
00:28:33.421 --> 00:28:38.330
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think man,</v>

573
00:28:38.331 --> 00:28:40.400
<v Speaker 3>hopkins might've been 40 years old at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>

574
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.880
<v Speaker 3>cause it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stop and think about boxers.</v>

575
00:28:46.881 --> 00:28:50.050
<v Speaker 3>In the paSt there was a few guys like</v>
<v Speaker 3>archie moore,</v>

576
00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:55.120
<v Speaker 3>George Foreman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was 43 and 26.</v>

577
00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.590
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And almost 10 years later he's trying to</v>

578
00:29:00.591 --> 00:29:05.591
<v Speaker 3>still do that with these murderous white</v>
<v Speaker 3>men because kelly pavlock was a</v>

579
00:29:06.681 --> 00:29:09.560
<v Speaker 3>murderous white dude to murderous</v>
<v Speaker 3>puncher.</v>

580
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:10.610
<v Speaker 3>And then thIs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

581
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:14.660
<v Speaker 3>Joe Smith juniors at ferocious puncher</v>
<v Speaker 3>or he's just a killer.</v>

582
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.650
<v Speaker 3>Bernard hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you got a one thing you gotta give</v>

583
00:29:18.651 --> 00:29:21.200
<v Speaker 3>the guy is amazing as his career has</v>
<v Speaker 3>been.</v>

584
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:26.030
<v Speaker 3>Even at the very last fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he takes the toughest fight he can find</v>

585
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:27.710
<v Speaker 3>or one of the toughest ones.</v>

586
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.930
<v Speaker 3>Just a real young dangerous kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it just,</v>

587
00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.560
<v Speaker 3>even though like we've seen it happen</v>
<v Speaker 3>with sugar ray leonard,</v>

588
00:29:36.561 --> 00:29:37.340
<v Speaker 3>we saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

589
00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.920
<v Speaker 3>remember when sugar ray leonard got beat</v>
<v Speaker 3>up by hector camacho.</v>

590
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:44.020
<v Speaker 3>I just in long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And hector camacho just beat the shit</v>

591
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:44.831
<v Speaker 3>out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

592
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:46.930
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is weird to watch.</v>

593
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.110
<v Speaker 3>And he had billy blanks in his corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Billy blanks,</v>

594
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:53.570
<v Speaker 3>teaching them tibo</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>

595
00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.930
<v Speaker 3>He had billy blanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Billy blanks is a karate champion too.</v>

596
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.160
<v Speaker 3>He was a yoke dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

597
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.200
<v Speaker 3>knows a lot aBout fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently triggered something</v>

598
00:30:02.201 --> 00:30:05.350
<v Speaker 3>fucked up with his calf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you pulled a muscle in his calf.</v>

599
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Then he had to get a cortisone shot</v>
<v Speaker 3>before the fight.</v>

600
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:13.600
<v Speaker 3>He had like a little bit of a limp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember would Hector camacho fucked</v>

601
00:30:13.601 --> 00:30:16.930
<v Speaker 3>him up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the really scary one was Terry</v>

602
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.240
<v Speaker 3>Norris when Terry Norris beat up sugar</v>
<v Speaker 3>ray leonard.</v>

603
00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:22.420
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terry norris jr</v>

604
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.980
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terry norris.</v>

605
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:31.060
<v Speaker 3>He put a beating on a lot of dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a scary kid</v>

606
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.860
<v Speaker 3>when he was at his best terry noises</v>
<v Speaker 3>like lightning.</v>

607
00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is when Terry Norris was,</v>

608
00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>world class and he was just a step</v>

609
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:49.270
<v Speaker 3>faster than sugar ray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you could see he's getting into him.</v>

610
00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:54.730
<v Speaker 3>Terry norris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had been knocked out a few times</v>

611
00:30:54.731 --> 00:30:57.280
<v Speaker 3>himself to man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got gotten the war is one of the</v>

612
00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.470
<v Speaker 3>exciting things about norris was that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

613
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.200
<v Speaker 3>he would get hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would get in front of guys and he</v>

614
00:31:02.201 --> 00:31:03.034
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

615
00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:08.620
<v Speaker 3>really take some risks and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons why he was so fun to watch,</v>

616
00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.450
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just,</v>

617
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't even remember exactly how this</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight ends,</v>

618
00:31:16.301 --> 00:31:20.920
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pretty sure terry stopped him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

619
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:23.610
<v Speaker 3>this is just round seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a highlight or.</v>

620
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:25.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

621
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:29.920
<v Speaker 3>They got knocked down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

622
00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:31.780
<v Speaker 3>See when you see shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

623
00:31:31.781 --> 00:31:33.570
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See him,</v>

624
00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:34.690
<v Speaker 3>get up staggered.</v>

625
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.110
<v Speaker 3>We've seen this so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't.</v>

626
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:43.480
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be weird at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

627
00:31:43.481 --> 00:31:44.810
<v Speaker 3>what a good time for the internet to</v>
<v Speaker 3>freeze.</v>

628
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:53.310
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be a confusing to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just some.</v>

629
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.850
<v Speaker 3>It's this story that repeats itself over</v>
<v Speaker 3>and over and over again.</v>

630
00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:00.910
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem like anybody ever learns</v>
<v Speaker 3>their lesson.</v>

631
00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:04.600
<v Speaker 3>There's a few guys that get out on top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lIke if I really do hope,</v>

632
00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:07.000
<v Speaker 3>floyd mayweather says fuck you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

633
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.210
<v Speaker 3>It just takes all that money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do hope he does that.</v>

634
00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:14.860
<v Speaker 3>I would love to see a guy get through</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing without ever getting</v>

635
00:32:14.861 --> 00:32:18.070
<v Speaker 3>fucked up once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I mean if you think about what he's</v>

636
00:32:18.071 --> 00:32:22.000
<v Speaker 3>done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>made stupid amounts of money and got</v>

637
00:32:22.001 --> 00:32:26.080
<v Speaker 3>through the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might have gotten her three or four</v>

638
00:32:26.081 --> 00:32:29.170
<v Speaker 3>times and it's whole career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might have gotten tagged,</v>

639
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:31.720
<v Speaker 3>never got beat up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never got knocked out.</v>

640
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:36.190
<v Speaker 3>Just get tagged a few times over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>course of how many fights.</v>

641
00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's beautiful.</v>

642
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 3>Someone can do</v>

643
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.700
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's like retiring as a bmx rider with</v>

644
00:32:43.701 --> 00:32:47.330
<v Speaker 6>no broken bones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that possible to do?</v>

645
00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.313
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that.</v>

646
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:50.610
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

647
00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.920
<v Speaker 6>See what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what he's done.</v>

648
00:32:52.921 --> 00:32:57.390
<v Speaker 6>If floyd mayweather retires,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's done the thing that nobody ever</v>

649
00:32:57.391 --> 00:33:01.590
<v Speaker 6>does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He went out on top undefeated with all</v>

650
00:33:01.591 --> 00:33:06.440
<v Speaker 6>the money after having fought all</v>
<v Speaker 6>challengers mean he might've fought pack</v>

651
00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.250
<v Speaker 6>y'all late,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you can't deny that he fought all</v>

652
00:33:08.251 --> 00:33:09.084
<v Speaker 6>challengers.</v>

653
00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:14.260
<v Speaker 4>Hooky as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the 50 things seems to be an</v>

654
00:33:14.261 --> 00:33:17.660
<v Speaker 4>issue or not an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forty to 50.</v>

655
00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:19.210
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not he wants to break the</v>

656
00:33:19.211 --> 00:33:22.000
<v Speaker 4>record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean how much of that as his ego.</v>

657
00:33:22.001 --> 00:33:23.500
<v Speaker 4>That's gonna last for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

658
00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:24.580
<v Speaker 4>he's still pretty young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

659
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean he's,</v>

660
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:30.050
<v Speaker 6>I think he's 36 if I had a gas,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's in really good shape.</v>

661
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.600
<v Speaker 6>I mean he takes care of himself really</v>
<v Speaker 6>well.</v>

662
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:38.080
<v Speaker 6>He's notoriously disciplined about</v>
<v Speaker 6>workouts and he'll even go out at night,</v>

663
00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.210
<v Speaker 6>go to a nightclub,</v>
<v Speaker 6>drink water,</v>

664
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.380
<v Speaker 6>and then work out at 2:00 in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 6>because he has his own gym and his own</v>

665
00:33:45.381 --> 00:33:50.381
<v Speaker 6>thing and he and he works hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't get that good on just talent.</v>

666
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.090
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get that good on talent and</v>

667
00:33:53.091 --> 00:33:56.540
<v Speaker 6>discipline and hard fucking work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's just no way around it.</v>

668
00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.880
<v Speaker 6>And smart.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You've got to be smart too.</v>

669
00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.890
<v Speaker 6>You got to be sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to be clever.</v>

670
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:01.940
<v Speaker 4>Do you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

671
00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.560
<v Speaker 4>who is training right now for a fight?</v>

672
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:05.130
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a trained soldier.</v>

673
00:34:05.131 --> 00:34:10.131
<v Speaker 6>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>soldier boy is really going to fight</v>

674
00:34:10.891 --> 00:34:12.000
<v Speaker 6>chris brown.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that real?</v>

675
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.883
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

676
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:16.670
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't seem like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's been talked about for a few</v>

677
00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.550
<v Speaker 4>days now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently it's going to be on paper</v>

678
00:34:18.551 --> 00:34:20.120
<v Speaker 4>view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

679
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.340
<v Speaker 4>and fighting over a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't.</v>

680
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chris brown is gonna fuck him up.</v>

681
00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:25.963
<v Speaker 4>Probably.</v>

682
00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:28.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's an angry dude that.</v>

683
00:34:28.161 --> 00:34:29.460
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that dude is on the left with the red.</v>

684
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.290
<v Speaker 6>That's a real angry dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The other dude,</v>

685
00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:37.750
<v Speaker 6>I just do not think he is angry,</v>

686
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:40.933
<v Speaker 4>but knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

687
00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.620
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen either of them</v>
<v Speaker 4>personally know</v>

688
00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.090
<v Speaker 6>one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe soulja boy's been hide some sick</v>

689
00:34:45.091 --> 00:34:48.330
<v Speaker 6>boxing skills and just pretending this</v>
<v Speaker 6>whole time,</v>

690
00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.600
<v Speaker 6>I doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>

691
00:34:49.601 --> 00:34:52.210
<v Speaker 6>I feel like chris brown is probably</v>
<v Speaker 6>punched a lot more people,</v>

692
00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.910
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't you think?</v>

693
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.810
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All,</v>

694
00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:58.510
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wife beating girl beating jokes aside.</v>

695
00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:03.190
<v Speaker 6>He's definitely seems like a dude who is</v>
<v Speaker 6>much more likely to punch people.</v>

696
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:05.540
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>

697
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:08.930
<v Speaker 4>maybe more likely to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I couldn't really see neither either</v>

698
00:35:08.931 --> 00:35:10.640
<v Speaker 4>of them getting in like a street fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>or anything.</v>

699
00:35:10.641 --> 00:35:15.350
<v Speaker 4>They've been pretty famous for most of</v>
<v Speaker 4>their life and pretending to hm.</v>

700
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:17.660
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two guys,</v>

702

<v Speaker 4>So I mean they might have thrown some</v>

703
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.130
<v Speaker 4>darn down once or twice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh</v>

715
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:52.930
<v Speaker 4>Have a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to think about this.</v>

716
00:35:52.931 --> 00:35:54.550
<v Speaker 4>Hasn't there been other things?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

717
00:35:54.551 --> 00:35:57.010
<v Speaker 4>I know you were supposedly supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight wesley snipes,</v>

718
00:35:57.011 --> 00:35:59.620
<v Speaker 4>but like wasn't there other things like</v>
<v Speaker 4>this ever happen?</v>

719
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:03.260
<v Speaker 6>The whole celebrity boxing show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember That happened a couple times.</v>

720
00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:06.090
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Danny bonaduce fought screech.</v>

721
00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:08.930
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he fucked up a couple of people.</v>

722
00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.840
<v Speaker 4>I remember when I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were supposed to be a big event</v>

723
00:36:11.841 --> 00:36:15.140
<v Speaker 4>where shaquille o'neal was supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go one on one on pay per view with this</v>

724
00:36:15.141 --> 00:36:17.930
<v Speaker 4>other big player named chemo chemo one</v>
<v Speaker 4>box.</v>

725
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:19.520
<v Speaker 4>Not box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were going to come play basketball</v>

726
00:36:19.521 --> 00:36:22.160
<v Speaker 4>one on one for a million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it never ended up happening.</v>

727
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:23.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't know wHy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

728
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:27.470
<v Speaker 4>it went away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was just kinD of wondering in my</v>

729
00:36:27.471 --> 00:36:30.380
<v Speaker 4>head like I feel like this is how I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>heard things like this coming up and</v>

730
00:36:30.381 --> 00:36:31.820
<v Speaker 4>have like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or at least been announced,</v>

731
00:36:31.821 --> 00:36:33.050
<v Speaker 4>but that just kind of fizzle out.</v>

732
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:34.540
<v Speaker 6>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

733
00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.540
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people have done crazy shit.</v>

734
00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:41.920
<v Speaker 6>This just seems like a really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really nutty one and they're fighting</v>

735
00:36:41.921 --> 00:36:45.020
<v Speaker 6>over a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just.</v>

736
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.590
<v Speaker 6>Have you seen any evidence of soldier</v>
<v Speaker 6>boy's athleticism?</v>

737
00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:51.350
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody put up a video of him working</v>

738
00:36:51.351 --> 00:36:54.080
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a compilation of him working</v>

739
00:36:54.081 --> 00:36:54.930
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

740
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.110
<v Speaker 6>but it's hard to tell if he's just being</v>
<v Speaker 6>silly,</v>

741
00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.310
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

742
00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.390
<v Speaker 6>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's shadow boxing and he's riding an</v>

743
00:37:02.391 --> 00:37:05.780
<v Speaker 6>elliptical machine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He seems like a really young guy.</v>

744
00:37:05.781 --> 00:37:06.614
<v Speaker 6>How old is he?</v>

745
00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.690
<v Speaker 7>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 7>In his twenties still too.</v>

746
00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:12.850
<v Speaker 6>He's in his twenties.</v>

747
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:13.743
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

748
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.970
<v Speaker 6>Well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a bunch of this complication</v>

749
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:25.520
<v Speaker 6>here is so</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoever they do,</v>

750
00:37:25.521 --> 00:37:26.810
<v Speaker 6>that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>

751
00:37:26.811 --> 00:37:28.520
<v Speaker 6>oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

752
00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:33.830
<v Speaker 6>you're working out with your socks on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is not the same compilation,</v>

753
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:35.660
<v Speaker 6>but it was pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

754
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:38.350
<v Speaker 6>only real savages.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Workout with their socks off.</v>

755
00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:44.330
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

756
00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:46.270
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

757
00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.590
<v Speaker 6>why do they want to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's two,</v>

758
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.380
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they need a hug it out.</v>

759
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:55.450
<v Speaker 4>When you were talking about that black</v>
<v Speaker 4>mirror episode,</v>

760
00:37:55.451 --> 00:37:56.710
<v Speaker 4>I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the one that you saw.</v>

761
00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:59.430
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I actually got on and</v>

762
00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.540
<v Speaker 4>was seeing shown at this seat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

763
00:38:01.541 --> 00:38:05.650
<v Speaker 4>Event was that I showed it to the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>night that gopro gimbal I got.</v>

764
00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:10.730
<v Speaker 4>It's called the a karma grip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lets you hold onto it.</v>

765
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:15.900
<v Speaker 4>I'll see it if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is some of the video I shot</v>

766
00:38:15.901 --> 00:38:16.490
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>

767
00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.780
<v Speaker 6>And so the idea is that it balances</v>
<v Speaker 6>itself.</v>

768
00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:20.740
<v Speaker 4>Put the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the camera's on you.</v>

769
00:38:20.741 --> 00:38:23.230
<v Speaker 4>So like you just kind of hold it and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>keeps itself stem stable.</v>

770
00:38:23.231 --> 00:38:26.680
<v Speaker 4>So like as you can jiggle it around a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit and it stays pretty simple.</v>

771
00:38:26.681 --> 00:38:30.490
<v Speaker 4>And this was me walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have it at two to a double speed here.</v>

772
00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.130
<v Speaker 4>But this was connected to my shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically.</v>

773
00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:35.653
<v Speaker 4>And I was walking.</v>

774
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.940
<v Speaker 6>So you taped it to shoulder?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

775
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:42.540
<v Speaker 6>I had a velcro strap</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this.</v>

776
00:38:42.541 --> 00:38:43.560
<v Speaker 6>I had a brown my backpack.</v>

777
00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.900
<v Speaker 5>And so I was just kind of like walking</v>
<v Speaker 5>around the event and here's one of the,</v>

778
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:51.380
<v Speaker 5>here's one of the cool things I did see</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the event too was a projector that's</v>

779
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.660
<v Speaker 5>projecting on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

780
00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:57.520
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the stabilization actually</v>

781
00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:03.100
<v Speaker 5>stay up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this,</v>

782
00:39:03.101 --> 00:39:06.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this projector right here is projecting</v>

783
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:09.790
<v Speaker 5>onto a curtain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I kind of ran past it pretty fast.</v>

784
00:39:09.791 --> 00:39:11.650
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't really shooting my video for</v>
<v Speaker 5>that purpose,</v>

785
00:39:11.651 --> 00:39:12.160
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

786
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.830
<v Speaker 6>let's take a shower curtain with like a</v>
<v Speaker 6>pattern on it.</v>

787
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.290
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's showing a solid image on that.</v>

788
00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:19.020
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's showing a hockey game and you're</v>

789
00:39:19.021 --> 00:39:22.890
<v Speaker 5>not seeing the ripples,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you don't need a flat screen for this</v>

790
00:39:22.891 --> 00:39:24.750
<v Speaker 5>projector.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can project it on anything.</v>

791
00:39:24.751 --> 00:39:28.440
<v Speaker 5>And I got three exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or ideally you would want something a</v>

792
00:39:28.441 --> 00:39:29.580
<v Speaker 5>little smoother than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

793
00:39:29.581 --> 00:39:31.140
<v Speaker 5>you could still have a flat image on</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

794
00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:33.030
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

795
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.280
<v Speaker 5>that was pretty neat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But some of this video is pretty cool on</v>

796
00:39:35.281 --> 00:39:38.370
<v Speaker 5>the stabilization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I went over to the samsung</v>

797
00:39:38.371 --> 00:39:41.820
<v Speaker 5>booth and they have what they're kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>showing here.</v>

798
00:39:41.821 --> 00:39:46.821
<v Speaker 5>Is this stuff flat flat hanging tv.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which different.</v>

799
00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:52.170
<v Speaker 5>Only way it's different from the things</v>
<v Speaker 5>now as like when you hang a tv up on a</v>

800
00:39:52.171 --> 00:39:54.180
<v Speaker 5>wall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of hanging off about four to</v>

801
00:39:54.181 --> 00:39:56.790
<v Speaker 5>six inches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is literally flat.</v>

802
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:58.880
<v Speaker 5>Don't know if you can see right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

803
00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.560
<v Speaker 5>it looks like I couldn't get very close</v>
<v Speaker 5>paper.</v>

804
00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:02.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can't really.</v>

805
00:40:02.521 --> 00:40:04.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you could slide anything</v>
<v Speaker 5>in there.</v>

806
00:40:04.011 --> 00:40:07.800
<v Speaker 5>It says it's a no gap wall mount and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then there's really no cords hanging off</v>

807
00:40:07.801 --> 00:40:09.630
<v Speaker 5>of there either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one cord.</v>

808
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.420
<v Speaker 5>No htmi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know if power was coming</v>

809
00:40:12.421 --> 00:40:15.390
<v Speaker 5>off of it either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It then one optical cord.</v>

810
00:40:15.391 --> 00:40:18.750
<v Speaker 5>So it's like using light optical cables.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Use light waves.</v>

811
00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.120
<v Speaker 6>So the one chord is powering it and</v>
<v Speaker 6>providing the data.</v>

812
00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.020
<v Speaker 5>See it says invisible connection right</v>
<v Speaker 5>there on top.</v>

813
00:40:26.021 --> 00:40:27.490
<v Speaker 5>It's showing some of the data.</v>

814
00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.870
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it kind of makes sense.</v>

815
00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.720
<v Speaker 6>What would they can do now with these</v>
<v Speaker 6>power?</v>

816
00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.170
<v Speaker 6>I should say</v>

817
00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:35.190
<v Speaker 5>set a power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It hasn't,</v>

818
00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:38.830
<v Speaker 5>but it does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do all the four k data does the htmi in</v>

819
00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:40.080
<v Speaker 5>every place has all of that.</v>

820
00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.240
<v Speaker 6>But with these new iphones,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with that,</v>

821
00:40:42.241 --> 00:40:43.860
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is that connection connecting</v>

822
00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.810
<v Speaker 6>lightning connector,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that connector,</v>

823
00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.790
<v Speaker 6>you use it for sound like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

824
00:40:47.791 --> 00:40:48.630
<v Speaker 6>your earplugs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>

825
00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:51.180
<v Speaker 6>Your era earbuds,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you use it for,</v>

826
00:40:51.181 --> 00:40:52.560
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an external microphone.</v>

827
00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:57.980
<v Speaker 6>You can use it for the charges if you</v>
<v Speaker 6>could split it off so it charges it at</v>

828
00:40:59.191 --> 00:41:01.830
<v Speaker 6>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're also listening to music so both</v>

829
00:41:01.831 --> 00:41:03.150
<v Speaker 6>things can go through at the same time.</v>

830
00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.680
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>another interesting thing that was being</v>

831
00:41:05.681 --> 00:41:09.380
<v Speaker 5>shown is some transparent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

832
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.120
<v Speaker 5>lcd screens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm trying to say this one a little</v>

833
00:41:13.121 --> 00:41:15.760
<v Speaker 5>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This one right here in the middle,</v>

834
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:19.210
<v Speaker 5>discuss trying to show you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This screen right here is actually a</v>

835
00:41:19.211 --> 00:41:24.100
<v Speaker 5>full lcd screen pointing at the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's an art display shown over</v>

836
00:41:24.101 --> 00:41:26.650
<v Speaker 5>top of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like an eight ink art display.</v>

837
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:29.440
<v Speaker 5>So when you're not using it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're not using the tv,</v>

838
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.560
<v Speaker 5>it looks like a piece of art hanging on</v>
<v Speaker 5>your wall with the rest of the art.</v>

839
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.840
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

840
00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.280
<v Speaker 3>so it's a screensaver,</v>

841
00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.870
<v Speaker 5>basically a screensaver.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's insane.</v>

842
00:41:39.871 --> 00:41:44.250
<v Speaker 5>And there were a couple other companies</v>
<v Speaker 5>showing some seethrough lcd screens that</v>

843
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.070
<v Speaker 5>great idea white.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are all,</v>

844
00:41:47.071 --> 00:41:49.230
<v Speaker 5>still haven't come to market yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is some of the stuff that</v>

845
00:41:49.231 --> 00:41:50.064
<v Speaker 5>they're showing.</v>

846
00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:53.320
<v Speaker 3>It's so beautiful too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's beautiful artwork and if you can</v>

847
00:41:53.321 --> 00:41:55.060
<v Speaker 3>do it with that kind of resolution.</v>

848
00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just,</v>

849
00:41:57.941 --> 00:41:59.860
<v Speaker 5>I looked at some three d,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the curved,</v>

850
00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:01.010
<v Speaker 5>curved,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

851
00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.400
<v Speaker 5>monitors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is like the most curved monitor</v>

852
00:42:03.401 --> 00:42:06.070
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm still not super sold on these.</v>

853
00:42:06.071 --> 00:42:11.071
<v Speaker 5>I don't really understand why everyone</v>
<v Speaker 5>or why they're selling them so hard.</v>

854
00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:14.560
<v Speaker 5>I don't really have an interest in</v>
<v Speaker 5>buying when I've tried a few times to</v>

855
00:42:14.561 --> 00:42:15.350
<v Speaker 5>look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

856
00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:18.650
<v Speaker 3>it's very gimmicky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me like,</v>

857
00:42:18.651 --> 00:42:20.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember when those three d tvs were</v>

858
00:42:20.961 --> 00:42:23.330
<v Speaker 3>coming out and everyone was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>convince everybody you need to get it.</v>

859
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:26.810
<v Speaker 3>Three d tvs coming and I've watched it</v>
<v Speaker 3>for like a couple of minutes with the</v>

860
00:42:26.811 --> 00:42:27.740
<v Speaker 3>glasses on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

861
00:42:27.741 --> 00:42:29.900
<v Speaker 3>this is not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not here yet.</v>

862
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:33.530
<v Speaker 3>Know it's just two goofy that's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much gone.</v>

863
00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the same with these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

864
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.450
<v Speaker 3>I think people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to use them for awhile then</v>

865
00:42:38.451 --> 00:42:39.740
<v Speaker 3>you're going to go with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is,</v>

866
00:42:39.741 --> 00:42:41.300
<v Speaker 3>why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why am I doing this?</v>

867
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:43.160
<v Speaker 3>Why am I curving the fucking</v>

868
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:45.530
<v Speaker 5>screen?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like it's only for one viewer</v>

869
00:42:45.531 --> 00:42:47.150
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause if your curve and it's for the</v>

870
00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:48.280
<v Speaker 5>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they can't.</v>

871
00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.890
<v Speaker 3>It's fucks it up for everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes it to one person.</v>

872
00:42:50.891 --> 00:42:55.750
<v Speaker 3>But I would say the majority of people's</v>
<v Speaker 3>use of computers is probably one person.</v>

873
00:42:55.751 --> 00:42:56.584
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

874
00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.201
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

875
00:42:57.201 --> 00:42:58.880
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At least one person at a time.</v>

876
00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:02.980
<v Speaker 5>So in this video you can also see kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of how crowded this whole event was to.</v>

877
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.080
<v Speaker 5>Is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a.</v>

878
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.500
<v Speaker 5>I walked 25 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think my,</v>

879
00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.800
<v Speaker 5>my fitbit tracked 25 miles in two days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

880
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:14.760
<v Speaker 5>And that was the only six to seven hours</v>
<v Speaker 5>per time that tired after that.</v>

881
00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.111
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

882
00:43:16.111 --> 00:43:18.870
<v Speaker 5>you had a workout for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was carrying around a backpack,</v>

883
00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:23.340
<v Speaker 5>a pounds of gear in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But here's an interesting new laptop</v>

884
00:43:23.341 --> 00:43:26.250
<v Speaker 5>coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't really get a good view on it.</v>

885
00:43:26.251 --> 00:43:28.980
<v Speaker 5>I kind of picked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's literally,</v>

886
00:43:28.981 --> 00:43:32.670
<v Speaker 5>I think it weighs less than a pound or</v>
<v Speaker 5>right around a pound.</v>

887
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:36.870
<v Speaker 5>And it felt like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a kid's toy.</v>

888
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:40.340
<v Speaker 5>That's how the plasticky it did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to say it felt cheap,</v>

889
00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.650
<v Speaker 5>but it felt like a toy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It felt like you could just throw it</v>

890
00:43:42.651 --> 00:43:46.400
<v Speaker 5>like a frisbee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was a full laptop made by</v>

891
00:43:46.401 --> 00:43:47.480
<v Speaker 5>samsung.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

892
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.830
<v Speaker 5>and had an lcd screen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a full keyboard,</v>

893
00:43:49.831 --> 00:43:52.900
<v Speaker 5>I had a mouse pad and they had a little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

894
00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.030
<v Speaker 5>I think it was a scale next to each</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that just proved to you how much</v>

895
00:43:56.031 --> 00:43:56.864
<v Speaker 5>it weighed.</v>

896
00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:01.230
<v Speaker 3>But are you that much of a pussy that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can carry around a one pound laptop?</v>

897
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:04.080
<v Speaker 3>Get it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes and no,</v>

898
00:44:04.081 --> 00:44:04.720
<v Speaker 3>but I mean the safe.</v>

899
00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.370
<v Speaker 5>If you want to take one hunting and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>need to,</v>

900
00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:08.280
<v Speaker 5>you all your ounces like oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well</v>

901
00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.980
<v Speaker 3>definitely shouldn't take a laptop or</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

902
00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.680
<v Speaker 3>But if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

903
00:44:12.681 --> 00:44:14.530
<v Speaker 3>you would definitely want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

904
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:19.080
<v Speaker 3>Guys cut their toothbrushes in half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of like drastic weight</v>

905
00:44:19.081 --> 00:44:22.590
<v Speaker 3>reduction when it comes to those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just feel like for laptops it's</v>

906
00:44:22.591 --> 00:44:25.020
<v Speaker 3>not that hard to carry one around and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

907
00:44:25.021 --> 00:44:30.021
<v Speaker 3>you put it on your back and to me like</v>
<v Speaker 3>features and a hard drive and</v>

908
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.190
<v Speaker 2>speed and that's the most important</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

909
00:44:34.191 --> 00:44:38.430
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that hard to carry a pound or</v>

910
00:44:38.431 --> 00:44:40.690
<v Speaker 2>two pounds or whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three pounds.</v>

911
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:45.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't gotten that back crazy.</v>

912
00:44:45.121 --> 00:44:47.230
<v Speaker 2>I guess they are getting all lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

913
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Means that doesn't weigh that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those retina displays are very light and</v>

914
00:44:51.031 --> 00:44:53.000
<v Speaker 2>it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

915
00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:56.040
<v Speaker 2>And then they have the heirs and those</v>
<v Speaker 2>are featherlite.</v>

916
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.140
<v Speaker 2>You don't need anything lighter than a</v>
<v Speaker 2>goddamn mac book.</v>

917
00:44:58.141 --> 00:45:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Air sure that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

918
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be a reason.</v>

919
00:45:02.221 --> 00:45:04.800
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be a small market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also probably is way cheaper than a</v>

920
00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:06.240
<v Speaker 2>macbook air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to say.</v>

921
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Well you remember when people want it</v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller and smaller phones,</v>

922
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:12.750
<v Speaker 2>we bias fullness that big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a phone once that like it was so</v>

923
00:45:12.751 --> 00:45:17.130
<v Speaker 2>small that like there was a dial for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember how the fucking</v>

924
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 2>numbers were pressed.</v>

925
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:24.050
<v Speaker 2>There was some novel way of like they</v>
<v Speaker 2>barely could fit a number pad like to</v>

926
00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.700
<v Speaker 2>dial phone numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they had some weird dial thing to it.</v>

927
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Trying to remember just reminded me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be making this up.</v>

928
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:36.510
<v Speaker 2>Iphone prototype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It showed an iphone prototype.</v>

929
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:38.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it came out today or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not today,</v>

930
00:45:38.251 --> 00:45:43.251
<v Speaker 2>but this week someone made a or showed</v>
<v Speaker 2>video of how one of the ways in Iceland</v>

931
00:45:45.061 --> 00:45:48.540
<v Speaker 2>was supposed to originally work and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was using that scroll wheel that used to</v>

932
00:45:48.541 --> 00:45:50.880
<v Speaker 2>be on an eye on the old ipods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do remember that?</v>

933
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:54.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so someone kind of hacked it together.</v>

934
00:45:54.571 --> 00:45:57.870
<v Speaker 2>I think on a current iphone to show you</v>
<v Speaker 2>how this worked,</v>

935
00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:01.980
<v Speaker 2>this operating system worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seemed like the aap obviously</v>

936
00:46:01.981 --> 00:46:06.981
<v Speaker 2>worst way ever to be controlling a phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>because even I think you would had to</v>

937
00:46:07.111 --> 00:46:09.780
<v Speaker 2>input numbers that way by scrolling two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

938
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:12.720
<v Speaker 2>four seems so bad.</v>

939
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:15.480
<v Speaker 2>It was that really considered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's work.</v>

940
00:46:15.481 --> 00:46:18.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a working prototype,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd have to say someone at least</v>

941
00:46:18.511 --> 00:46:20.310
<v Speaker 2>thought it might've been a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

942
00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:24.480
<v Speaker 2>it has to be that they went through a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of different ideas before they</v>

943
00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:25.950
<v Speaker 2>came up with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

944
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean I heard they're going through 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>different phones right now just to try</v>

945
00:46:28.591 --> 00:46:31.830
<v Speaker 2>to figure out what the next iphone</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to go with this or 10</v>

946
00:46:31.831 --> 00:46:34.590
<v Speaker 2>different testing models.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you think that they've hit that</v>

947
00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:39.591
<v Speaker 2>point of critical mass where it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless something really huge comes along</v>

948
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.830
<v Speaker 2>like a hologram projectors or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>really bananas,</v>

949
00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.860
<v Speaker 2>you've got everything now you've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing cameras,</v>

950
00:46:46.861 --> 00:46:51.861
<v Speaker 2>you've got massive hard drive space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got so much you've got.</v>

951
00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:55.170
<v Speaker 2>You have all these apps that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>use.</v>

952
00:46:55.171 --> 00:46:58.140
<v Speaker 2>You've got all this usability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what are you gonna do that's gonna</v>

953
00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:02.460
<v Speaker 2>make people want like a next generation</v>
<v Speaker 2>and next generation and next generation.</v>

954
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Like there has to be some sort of a leap</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it seems like for all the</v>

955
00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:09.630
<v Speaker 2>technology we have today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are almost like over computered</v>

956
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.210
<v Speaker 2>and an over phoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

957
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Definitely for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

958
00:47:13.761 --> 00:47:15.690
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to walk when I was walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>around that event,</v>

959
00:47:15.691 --> 00:47:19.610
<v Speaker 2>I was looking for like either the big</v>
<v Speaker 2>crowds to see what everyone was like</v>

960
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.610
<v Speaker 2>stuck around looking at because this</v>
<v Speaker 2>event was so huge to,</v>

961
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:26.360
<v Speaker 2>to stop and spend five minutes at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a particular,</v>

962
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pod or product</v>

963
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:34.300
<v Speaker 4>or even just let someone talk to you to</v>
<v Speaker 4>take your time for that five minutes is</v>

964
00:47:34.301 --> 00:47:36.400
<v Speaker 4>insane because there's just so much to</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at.</v>

965
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.580
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time,</v>

966
00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.810
<v Speaker 4>well I kind of lost what I was doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

967
00:47:42.811 --> 00:47:45.460
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just kind of looked over at this thing</v>

968
00:47:45.461 --> 00:47:49.450
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to show you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was distinct called vertifi,</v>

969
00:47:49.451 --> 00:47:52.160
<v Speaker 4>which is this three d virtual reality</v>
<v Speaker 4>program who,</v>

970
00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:55.000
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they showed this guy over here doing a</v>

971
00:47:55.001 --> 00:47:56.440
<v Speaker 4>demo for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to wait in line.</v>

972
00:47:56.441 --> 00:47:58.510
<v Speaker 4>I really didn't want to wait in any</v>
<v Speaker 4>lines there because there was so many</v>

973
00:47:58.511 --> 00:48:02.900
<v Speaker 4>people and I didn't feel very good to</v>
<v Speaker 4>stand somewhere for 30 minutes.</v>

974
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.823
<v Speaker 4>Sweat</v>

975
00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:06.450
<v Speaker 6>young.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jamie got the same stomach flu that I</v>

976
00:48:06.451 --> 00:48:07.284
<v Speaker 6>had.</v>

977
00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:09.490
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what this shows right here is this.</v>

978
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:12.750
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm pretty sure that this thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>on top of yours to camera that records</v>

979
00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.950
<v Speaker 4>the event.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

980
00:48:14.951 --> 00:48:16.960
<v Speaker 4>Then what they were showing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy was getting a demo of it,</v>

981
00:48:16.961 --> 00:48:20.980
<v Speaker 4>which I wasn't seeing on this screen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they did show and you can kind of</v>

982
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:22.810
<v Speaker 4>see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pinching his hand up there on top</v>

983
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.680
<v Speaker 4>on this video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They show you watching,</v>

984
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:28.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a vr headset,</v>

985
00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:32.610
<v Speaker 4>let's say a concert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you can decide to grab the lead</v>

986
00:48:32.611 --> 00:48:34.440
<v Speaker 4>singer and move them into your living</v>
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>

987
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.970
<v Speaker 4>So the performance this now he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

988
00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:41.250
<v Speaker 4>it was real weird how it showed it and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have it on this actual video.</v>

989
00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:42.690
<v Speaker 4>I went back and watched another</v>

990
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.660
<v Speaker 6>and so he's wearing some fairly small</v>
<v Speaker 6>goggles.</v>

991
00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.550
<v Speaker 6>It was not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not a lot to what he's wearing.</v>

992
00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:49.421
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the,</v>

993
00:48:49.421 --> 00:48:50.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

994
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.810
<v Speaker 4>There's about four or five big things</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on there.</v>

995
00:48:52.811 --> 00:48:57.130
<v Speaker 4>There's vr headsets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different new multiple companies sharing</v>

996
00:48:57.131 --> 00:48:57.870
<v Speaker 4>vr headsets.</v>

997
00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:01.110
<v Speaker 6>Was this augmented or was it virtual</v>
<v Speaker 6>reality?</v>

998
00:49:01.111 --> 00:49:03.150
<v Speaker 6>Because I believe it was the virtual</v>
<v Speaker 6>reality,</v>

999
00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:07.140
<v Speaker 6>but he reached up and grabbed someone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pinched it and brought it in yet.</v>

1000
00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.840
<v Speaker 6>But it would have to be a little</v>
<v Speaker 6>augmented because you were seeing it in</v>

1001
00:49:09.841 --> 00:49:11.910
<v Speaker 6>your living room.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to also see the living room.</v>

1002
00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.770
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you go back to the video,</v>

1003
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:17.190
<v Speaker 6>you being there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like see,</v>

1004
00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.980
<v Speaker 6>like when you see his actual goggles</v>
<v Speaker 6>itself,</v>

1005
00:49:19.981 --> 00:49:22.860
<v Speaker 6>like watch ice pass by a little bit on</v>
<v Speaker 6>the can see it.</v>

1006
00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.030
<v Speaker 4>See that's the lead singer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Moved onto the couch.</v>

1007
00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.970
<v Speaker 4>Just bringing the artists to our home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How bizarre.</v>

1008
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.690
<v Speaker 4>Which would I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of like pulled into the comedy</v>

1009
00:49:32.691 --> 00:49:34.130
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could bring the comedian into your</v>

1010
00:49:34.131 --> 00:49:36.170
<v Speaker 4>living room and just have performed</v>
<v Speaker 4>performing your front and your living</v>

1011
00:49:36.171 --> 00:49:39.650
<v Speaker 4>room instead of at the comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That venue that they were at,</v>

1012
00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:41.270
<v Speaker 4>which would be interesting.</v>

1013
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:43.203
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1014
00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:45.820
<v Speaker 4>How odd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1015
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:51.030
<v Speaker 4>drones was a big a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are tons of drones now,</v>

1016
00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.020
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tiny ones.</v>

1017
00:49:53.021 --> 00:49:55.740
<v Speaker 4>There's this selfie drone which didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>seem like it worked very well.</v>

1018
00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.530
<v Speaker 4>It kept flying up and flying down</v>
<v Speaker 4>different sides.</v>

1019
00:49:58.531 --> 00:49:59.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm not quite sure how you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do</v>

1020
00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:00.470
<v Speaker 6>controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go.</v>

1021
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:04.070
<v Speaker 6>Go through this for a couple more</v>
<v Speaker 6>seconds to see that guy's a goggles</v>

1022
00:50:04.071 --> 00:50:05.990
<v Speaker 6>because I think he gets see through</v>
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

1023
00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:07.730
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look how he's looking.</v>

1024
00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:09.350
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1025
00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:14.350
<v Speaker 6>See how you see his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's what it seems like to me.</v>

1026
00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:16.710
<v Speaker 6>I have that microsoft surface.</v>

1027
00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:22.370
<v Speaker 4>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a behind it too as a</v>

1028
00:50:22.371 --> 00:50:24.230
<v Speaker 4>wireless vr headset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they were,</v>

1029
00:50:24.231 --> 00:50:26.270
<v Speaker 4>like I said too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were a lot of headsets and there</v>

1030
00:50:26.271 --> 00:50:29.600
<v Speaker 4>are lots of things and let's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me just throw out a number and say I</v>

1031
00:50:29.601 --> 00:50:34.370
<v Speaker 4>did five tech demos out of those five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two or three didn't work or that didn't</v>

1032
00:50:34.371 --> 00:50:36.740
<v Speaker 4>go well or that didn't work perfectly at</v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

1033
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:40.240
<v Speaker 4>So thAt's where I've kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that a lot of this stuff</v>

1034
00:50:40.241 --> 00:50:43.420
<v Speaker 4>wasn't maybe not ready or maybe it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be shown that way.</v>

1035
00:50:43.421 --> 00:50:44.254
<v Speaker 4>And you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like,</v>

1036
00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:48.370
<v Speaker 4>this is our only demo product we have</v>
<v Speaker 4>for you guys to see where it's supposed</v>

1037
00:50:48.371 --> 00:50:50.380
<v Speaker 4>to work all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It usually does,</v>

1038
00:50:50.381 --> 00:50:53.260
<v Speaker 4>but we've done so many demos today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It kind of froze up a little bit.</v>

1039
00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.030
<v Speaker 4>That could have been happening to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit,</v>

1040
00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:58.270
<v Speaker 4>but there is a lot of things going on</v>
<v Speaker 4>here where they're just trying to show</v>

1041
00:50:58.271 --> 00:51:00.970
<v Speaker 4>you some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Show you an idea and hope someone with a</v>

1042
00:51:00.971 --> 00:51:02.620
<v Speaker 4>lot of money walks by and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

1043
00:51:02.621 --> 00:51:04.230
<v Speaker 4>that looks like a good idea here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some one kid</v>

1044

<v Speaker 6>go make it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That kind of thing.</v>

1045
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:10.370
<v Speaker 6>Like some 19 thirties carnival barker</v>
<v Speaker 6>and know it works out for that.</v>

1046
00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:13.880
<v Speaker 6>does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are there lIke guys who troll around</v>

1047
00:51:13.881 --> 00:51:17.230
<v Speaker 6>this place and look for a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw products.</v>

1048
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:18.290
<v Speaker 6>I just walked by.</v>

1049
00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:20.870
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the intel booth and randomly saw a guy</v>

1050
00:51:20.871 --> 00:51:22.700
<v Speaker 4>will walk up to one of their workers and</v>
<v Speaker 4>say like,</v>

1051
00:51:22.701 --> 00:51:25.250
<v Speaker 4>I have some patents on baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wifi technology,</v>

1052
00:51:25.251 --> 00:51:26.084
<v Speaker 4>who do I talk?</v>

1053
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.380
<v Speaker 6>That kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's all.</v>

1054
00:51:27.381 --> 00:51:30.530
<v Speaker 6>there's tons of different meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Things sorting are happening by the way,</v>

1055
00:51:30.531 --> 00:51:32.630
<v Speaker 6>in case anybody misinterprets what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 6>saying.</v>

1056
00:51:32.631 --> 00:51:35.810
<v Speaker 6>Troll around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't mean like a fuck with people on</v>

1057
00:51:35.811 --> 00:51:38.660
<v Speaker 6>the internet troll.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean like fishing troll.</v>

1058
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.870
<v Speaker 6>when you drag a line behind you go look</v>
<v Speaker 6>for things to catch.</v>

1059
00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:44.790
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

1060
00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:49.850
<v Speaker 6>this was like the big thing in this ces</v>
<v Speaker 6>though as far as emerging technologies</v>

1061
00:51:50.301 --> 00:51:52.100
<v Speaker 6>with all this virtual reality stuff</v>

1062
00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:57.020
<v Speaker 4>every year it is a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently it's focused on something</v>

1063
00:51:57.021 --> 00:51:59.230
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this year there wasn't very much</v>

1064
00:51:59.231 --> 00:52:02.440
<v Speaker 4>cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything really and used in the past</v>

1065
00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.150
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's been big announcements of</v>

1066
00:52:04.151 --> 00:52:08.420
<v Speaker 4>cell phones from different companies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I only even solid maybe one and</v>

1067
00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.670
<v Speaker 4>it was this company called highway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe it's how you say it because</v>

1068
00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:14.580
<v Speaker 4>they had a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they paired with this a really well</v>

1069
00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:17.950
<v Speaker 4>known camera company called leica and</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a 20 megapixel camera.</v>

1070
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:23.230
<v Speaker 4>They make binoculars and stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1071
00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:28.420
<v Speaker 4>but I tested that out to see how good it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was and I wasn't sure if I was holding</v>

1072
00:52:28.421 --> 00:52:31.030
<v Speaker 4>the actual correct model,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was the one that had all the best</v>

1073
00:52:31.031 --> 00:52:33.730
<v Speaker 4>features in it because I had a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 4>different models out there.</v>

1074
00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:38.140
<v Speaker 4>So much going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really hard to get a grasp of</v>

1075
00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:39.250
<v Speaker 4>what you were doing.</v>

1076
00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:41.050
<v Speaker 6>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You bring this up.</v>

1077
00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:46.060
<v Speaker 6>It's making me think like when you get</v>
<v Speaker 6>to a certain level of this virtual</v>

1078
00:52:46.061 --> 00:52:48.580
<v Speaker 6>reality stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna want to look through like</v>

1079
00:52:48.581 --> 00:52:51.140
<v Speaker 6>the best lens available.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1080
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:55.360
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna want one of those high end</v>
<v Speaker 6>binocular companies to come along and</v>

1081
00:52:55.361 --> 00:52:56.320
<v Speaker 6>craft something.</v>

1082
00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1083
00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:01.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to remember right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say it's gopro.</v>

1084
00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:03.850
<v Speaker 4>I'll have to google it for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of say something off,</v>

1085
00:53:03.851 --> 00:53:05.380
<v Speaker 4>but do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you heard of the company called</v>

1086
00:53:05.381 --> 00:53:06.880
<v Speaker 4>hasselblad?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1087
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.730
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1088
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:10.460
<v Speaker 6>Go camera company that they were the</v>
<v Speaker 6>people that uh,</v>

1089
00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:12.250
<v Speaker 6>had the cameras that they put on the</v>
<v Speaker 6>moon.</v>

1090
00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:13.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's dji,</v>

1091
00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:19.030
<v Speaker 4>dji mobile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Allegedly they were on the moon.</v>

1092
00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:24.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So dji is a arguably the best drone</v>

1093
00:53:24.241 --> 00:53:25.680
<v Speaker 4>maker right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're biggest company.</v>

1094
00:53:25.681 --> 00:53:28.710
<v Speaker 4>It's a company come out of China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They make a,</v>

1095
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:30.870
<v Speaker 4>the phantom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was,</v>

1096
00:53:30.871 --> 00:53:34.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the biggest consumer drone and right now</v>

1097
00:53:34.691 --> 00:53:36.190
<v Speaker 4>they just put out the thing called the</v>
<v Speaker 4>maverick,</v>

1098
00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:38.860
<v Speaker 4>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they acquired hassle bad.</v>

1099
00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:41.650
<v Speaker 4>Apparently they had a minor stake in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>company and they just took a major</v>

1100
00:53:41.651 --> 00:53:45.230
<v Speaker 4>stake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they just took over the stockholding</v>

1101
00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:48.120
<v Speaker 4>what's the correct pronunciation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hassle bland.</v>

1102
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.983
<v Speaker 4>I believe so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1103
00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.110
<v Speaker 4>So dgi is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they made this thing called the</v>

1104
00:53:53.111 --> 00:53:54.970
<v Speaker 4>maverick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I got to hold up the event.</v>

1105
00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:58.060
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get the buy one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not there on backorder still</v>

1106
00:53:58.061 --> 00:53:59.950
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've been there for a little while</v>

1107
00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:03.160
<v Speaker 4>folded up because each of these legs</v>
<v Speaker 4>folds together.</v>

1108
00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:08.970
<v Speaker 4>It's a a little bit smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit bigger than this than my</v>

1109
00:54:08.971 --> 00:54:13.020
<v Speaker 4>iphone seven s a little bit thicker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can see that sticker,</v>

1110
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:17.780
<v Speaker 4>but the actual size you can hold it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's about same size as the palm of your</v>

1111
00:54:17.781 --> 00:54:19.070
<v Speaker 4>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>HolY shit.</v>

1112
00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.010
<v Speaker 4>And it shoots four k video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It goes up to,</v>

1113
00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:24.170
<v Speaker 4>I want to say for about four miles away</v>
<v Speaker 4>from you.</v>

1114
00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:27.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you'd obvIously you're going to lose</v>

1115
00:54:27.231 --> 00:54:29.840
<v Speaker 4>sight of it and it goes to I think 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30,</v>

1116
00:54:29.841 --> 00:54:34.400
<v Speaker 4>40 miles an hour or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something crazy and this is a bite sized</v>

1117
00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:39.650
<v Speaker 4>god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it avoid avoid things or obstacle</v>

1118
00:54:39.651 --> 00:54:41.540
<v Speaker 4>avoidance?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what these cameras on the front</v>

1119
00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:43.490
<v Speaker 4>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some on the back or the bottom</v>

1120
00:54:43.491 --> 00:54:46.200
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they have another versIon which is</v>

1121
00:54:46.201 --> 00:54:49.030
<v Speaker 4>the phantom four.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A pro I believe,</v>

1122
00:54:49.031 --> 00:54:51.750
<v Speaker 4>which is a bigger version than this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have an inspired,</v>

1123
00:54:51.751 --> 00:54:54.820
<v Speaker 4>which is the way bigger version and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have like the full film,</v>

1124
00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:59.100
<v Speaker 4>like a film company would use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has got like eight big crazy props</v>

1125
00:54:59.101 --> 00:54:59.790
<v Speaker 4>on it and whatnot.</v>

1126
00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:01.920
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember when they filmed that</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie?</v>

1127
00:55:01.921 --> 00:55:05.490
<v Speaker 3>The twilight zone and they didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>drones back then.</v>

1128
00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:10.160
<v Speaker 3>They had a helicopter and actual real</v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopter behind them doing a stunt.</v>

1129
00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:12.620
<v Speaker 4>which</v>

1130
00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:14.510
<v Speaker 3>do you remember that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible accident?</v>

1131
00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:16.341
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1132
00:55:16.341 --> 00:55:20.510
<v Speaker 3>it was a horrible accident where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>actor in this little girl were killed.</v>

1133
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.370
<v Speaker 4>Oh wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The helicopter came crashing down on</v>

1134
00:55:24.371 --> 00:55:26.140
<v Speaker 4>them that you said that there was two</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1135
00:55:26.141 --> 00:55:28.360
<v Speaker 4>I think I did hear about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't even show me this dude.</v>

1136
00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:32.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't even want to watch that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can try.</v>

1137
00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:36.840
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something.</v>

1138
00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.073
<v Speaker 4>Something about</v>

1139
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.880
<v Speaker 3>seeing people die for a movie too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like particularly gruesome.</v>

1140
00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:45.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did you think that you could just</v>

1141
00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:48.250
<v Speaker 3>fly that helicopter right next to</v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

1142
00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:50.380
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1143
00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.140
<v Speaker 4>with all this drone stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm able to kind of asked you this</v>

1144
00:55:53.141 --> 00:55:57.740
<v Speaker 4>question because I don't know if it's an</v>
<v Speaker 4>actual trend I see happening or if it's</v>

1145
00:55:57.741 --> 00:56:01.040
<v Speaker 4>just something they're forcing or what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's just seems to be a lot of,</v>

1146
00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:04.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>camera equipment being made available</v>

1147
00:56:04.081 --> 00:56:08.730
<v Speaker 4>for the individual to use to make really</v>
<v Speaker 4>high end stuff.</v>

1148
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:12.600
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know if it's the trend that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were just going to start making</v>

1149
00:56:12.601 --> 00:56:15.610
<v Speaker 4>all this content.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they gonna just start shooting</v>

1150
00:56:15.611 --> 00:56:18.440
<v Speaker 4>everything they're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they just making it as technology</v>

1151
00:56:18.441 --> 00:56:22.200
<v Speaker 4>and allowing that to happen for us?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1152
00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:27.000
<v Speaker 6>it seems like there's only so much you</v>
<v Speaker 6>can do with it.</v>

1153
00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:33.320
<v Speaker 6>I feel like what would they have to do</v>
<v Speaker 6>though is have the best shit.</v>

1154
00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:36.180
<v Speaker 6>So thing if someone has four k you have</v>
<v Speaker 6>to have four k,</v>

1155
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:38.120
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>someone has um,</v>

1156
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:40.790
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>virtual capability,</v>

1157
00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:43.370
<v Speaker 6>you could upload it digitally.</v>

1158
00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:45.390
<v Speaker 4>It's like fitness trackers were really</v>
<v Speaker 4>big there.</v>

1159
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:47.263
<v Speaker 4>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1160
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:49.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember who it was that came in</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1161
00:56:49.291 --> 00:56:51.300
<v Speaker 4>I think it was the first time burke came</v>
<v Speaker 4>in with one.</v>

1162
00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:53.720
<v Speaker 4>I sort of tried to ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like [inaudible].</v>

1163
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:56.070
<v Speaker 4>I had one too for a couple of weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it took it back because it got</v>

1164
00:56:56.071 --> 00:56:57.480
<v Speaker 4>recalled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was like,</v>

1165
00:56:57.510 --> 00:57:00.590
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one I had at the time got recalled,</v>

1166
00:57:00.591 --> 00:57:03.690
<v Speaker 4>it was for what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was causing a rash on people because</v>

1167
00:57:03.691 --> 00:57:05.760
<v Speaker 4>the battery connector wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1168
00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:06.730
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1169
00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:09.960
<v Speaker 4>They fixed it apparently now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I haven't bought another one since</v>

1170
00:57:09.961 --> 00:57:14.070
<v Speaker 4>then because I found out that the fitbit</v>
<v Speaker 4>app on my iphone works just about the</v>

1171
00:57:14.071 --> 00:57:18.390
<v Speaker 4>same and there's also the built in apple</v>
<v Speaker 4>iphone apps now to that do the health</v>

1172
00:57:18.391 --> 00:57:20.390
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what w,</v>

1173
00:57:20.391 --> 00:57:23.740
<v Speaker 4>what is everyone doing with all that</v>
<v Speaker 4>data or are they doing anything with it?</v>

1174
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:26.290
<v Speaker 4>Mostly at all besides really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

1175
00:57:26.291 --> 00:57:28.930
<v Speaker 4>really into fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People like personal trainers.</v>

1176
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.210
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there's some technologies that</v>

1177
00:57:31.211 --> 00:57:32.650
<v Speaker 6>even though they keep getting better and</v>
<v Speaker 6>better,</v>

1178
00:57:32.651 --> 00:57:36.730
<v Speaker 6>they're kind of ignored after awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 6>like here's one of the most bizarre</v>

1179
00:57:36.731 --> 00:57:39.040
<v Speaker 6>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His voice sound quality.</v>

1180
00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:43.240
<v Speaker 6>Nobody gives a fuck about when anybody's</v>
<v Speaker 6>voice sounds like on a phone.</v>

1181
00:57:43.241 --> 00:57:45.100
<v Speaker 6>It's like it almost never gets</v>
<v Speaker 6>discussed.</v>

1182
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:46.870
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>isn't that one of the most important</v>

1183
00:57:46.871 --> 00:57:49.630
<v Speaker 6>things about a phone?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You should be able to listen to someone</v>

1184
00:57:49.631 --> 00:57:53.080
<v Speaker 6>on a phone and it should sound like</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're talking to you and she'd be</v>

1185
00:57:53.081 --> 00:57:53.891
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right here.</v>

1186
00:57:53.891 --> 00:57:54.670
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's up jamie?</v>

1187
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:55.510
<v Speaker 6>Oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's up dude?</v>

1188
00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.990
<v Speaker 6>It never sounds that good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1189
00:57:57.370 --> 00:57:59.380
<v Speaker 6>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they have the ability to make it</v>

1190
00:57:59.381 --> 00:58:01.420
<v Speaker 6>sound that good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well why haven't they made it sound that</v>

1191
00:58:01.421 --> 00:58:04.150
<v Speaker 6>good?</v>
<v Speaker 6>People barely fucking use their phone as</v>

1192
00:58:04.151 --> 00:58:07.450
<v Speaker 6>a phone anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The phone part is totally stagnant.</v>

1193
00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:09.920
<v Speaker 6>Like the signal gets a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 6>better.</v>

1194
00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:13.640
<v Speaker 6>You can catch a signal somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it still sounds just as shitty as it</v>

1195
00:58:13.641 --> 00:58:16.520
<v Speaker 6>ever did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't sound perfect.</v>

1196
00:58:16.521 --> 00:58:21.170
<v Speaker 6>Clarity doesn't sound like you talking</v>
<v Speaker 6>to me in the same room you telling me</v>

1197
00:58:21.171 --> 00:58:23.270
<v Speaker 6>they can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course they can do that.</v>

1198
00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:28.010
<v Speaker 6>If they could get you to listen better</v>
<v Speaker 6>now with a better sound now than then</v>

1199
00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:30.230
<v Speaker 6>the rotary phones,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the 19 sixties,</v>

1200
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:34.330
<v Speaker 6>they could improve on the sound quality,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's no demand for it because</v>

1201
00:58:34.331 --> 00:58:38.020
<v Speaker 6>people hardly talk on the phone anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So iT becomes one of those things where</v>

1202
00:58:38.021 --> 00:58:40.090
<v Speaker 6>it just hits a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nobody gives a fuck about it.</v>

1203
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:43.270
<v Speaker 6>And then the market goes where people</v>
<v Speaker 6>give a fuck that people give a fuck</v>

1204
00:58:43.271 --> 00:58:45.340
<v Speaker 6>about cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to get a juicy camera.</v>

1205
00:58:45.341 --> 00:58:47.530
<v Speaker 6>I want a 15,</v>
<v Speaker 6>18,</v>

1206
00:58:47.531 --> 00:58:49.840
<v Speaker 6>whatever a megapixel is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It sounds awesome.</v>

1207
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:51.170
<v Speaker 6>Get me one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1208
00:58:51.171 --> 00:58:53.770
<v Speaker 6>it's gigapixel they have gigapixels I</v>
<v Speaker 6>need to get your pixel.</v>

1209
00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:58.540
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many people are just just buyIng the</v>

1210
00:58:58.541 --> 00:59:02.950
<v Speaker 6>latest shit me included because it's the</v>
<v Speaker 6>latest shit cuz it sounds awesome,</v>

1211
00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:04.420
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because you want that one.</v>

1212
00:59:04.450 --> 00:59:05.790
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the asce has the uh,</v>

1213
00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:11.040
<v Speaker 6>image stabilization that I'll never use.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's so much of that shit out there,</v>

1214
00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:15.220
<v Speaker 6>but it seems so compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1215
00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:18.850
<v Speaker 6>like if apple had an iphone eight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you and me would be in line like a</v>

1216
00:59:18.851 --> 00:59:19.684
<v Speaker 6>couple of years.</v>

1217
00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 4>Like I still keep talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I</v>

1218
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:26.270
<v Speaker 5>think about this for the seven s I have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's either I have it,</v>

1219
00:59:26.271 --> 00:59:28.670
<v Speaker 5>I like it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the camera's on is really good,</v>

1220
00:59:28.671 --> 00:59:30.890
<v Speaker 5>but it's so big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kind of dislike it.</v>

1221
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:32.960
<v Speaker 5>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked the,</v>

1222
00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:35.090
<v Speaker 5>I liked the smaller phone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to success.</v>

1223
00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:37.390
<v Speaker 6>Well the six or the seven,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1224
00:59:37.391 --> 00:59:38.880
<v Speaker 6>you can get a regular size one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two,</v>

1225
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:42.410
<v Speaker 5>but the stats on the phone or are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are down.</v>

1226
00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.780
<v Speaker 5>It's not as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not as good as a phone as the</v>

1227
00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:47.440
<v Speaker 5>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>S is really seven s plus or we're a</v>

1228
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:47.850
<v Speaker 5>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1229
00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:52.290
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as far as the hard drive in as far as</v>

1230
00:59:52.291 --> 00:59:53.124
<v Speaker 6>battery life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1231
00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:56.740
<v Speaker 5>It's got dual cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other ones don't have the battery</v>

1232
00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:58.360
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is actually really good.</v>

1233
00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.510
<v Speaker 5>I'm very good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm super surprised at how good the</v>

1234
01:00:01.511 --> 01:00:05.050
<v Speaker 5>battery is on his phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially if you don'T keep wifi and</v>

1235
01:00:05.051 --> 01:00:07.840
<v Speaker 5>bluetooth on all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can last two days almost,</v>

1236
01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:10.750
<v Speaker 5>which is way surprising because the</v>
<v Speaker 5>screen's way bigger,</v>

1237
01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:14.800
<v Speaker 5>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could sit when the next one comes out</v>

1238
01:00:14.801 --> 01:00:16.510
<v Speaker 5>and a couple of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a couple of months they're going to</v>

1239
01:00:16.511 --> 01:00:21.450
<v Speaker 5>announce it probably in march or may and</v>
<v Speaker 5>there'll be out by the fall like,</v>

1240
01:00:21.610 --> 01:00:24.250
<v Speaker 5>or do we need it again?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the answer is like why?</v>

1241
01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.260
<v Speaker 5>Because we're shooting it has four k</v>
<v Speaker 5>video on it and say,</v>

1242
01:00:26.261 --> 01:00:27.760
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I one has four k video,</v>

1243
01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:31.420
<v Speaker 5>but I've barely done anything with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>four k video and the four k video I do</v>

1244
01:00:31.421 --> 01:00:35.320
<v Speaker 5>have where like or with this go pro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just got the new gopro five you have</v>

1245
01:00:35.321 --> 01:00:40.210
<v Speaker 5>to</v>
<v Speaker 5>convert all the footage so that you can</v>

1246
01:00:40.211 --> 01:00:43.840
<v Speaker 5>actually edit it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like a big gigantic step that</v>

1247
01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:45.760
<v Speaker 5>have tO convert it for you.</v>

1248
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:46.603
<v Speaker 5>Edit it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1249
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:49.130
<v Speaker 5>you can do a little bit of editing and</v>
<v Speaker 5>their program,</v>

1250
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:54.080
<v Speaker 5>but to take it into final cut or to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I did just to show you more than 30</v>

1251
01:00:54.081 --> 01:00:57.590
<v Speaker 5>seconds at a time I had to spend</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

1252
01:00:57.591 --> 01:01:00.260
<v Speaker 5>12 minutes per eight minute video</v>
<v Speaker 5>converting all of it.</v>

1253
01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.780
<v Speaker 5>That's only because tHat's my.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The capabilities of my computer.</v>

1254
01:01:02.781 --> 01:01:04.580
<v Speaker 5>If I had a faster one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it'd been faster,</v>

1255
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.610
<v Speaker 5>but they're slower computers too and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just like,</v>

1256
01:01:07.611 --> 01:01:11.120
<v Speaker 5>what's the need of the four k video?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I couldn't even show the four k</v>

1257
01:01:11.121 --> 01:01:12.680
<v Speaker 5>video out because I can't broadcast</v>

1258
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.130
<v Speaker 6>how big of these files we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 6>about.</v>

1259
01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:17.770
<v Speaker 5>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For a nine minute video,</v>

1260
01:01:17.771 --> 01:01:18.690
<v Speaker 5>it was like 40 gig.</v>

1261
01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:23.780
<v Speaker 6>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a fucking giant hard drive.</v>

1262
01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:26.870
<v Speaker 6>Back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think my first hard drive was four</v>

1263
01:01:26.871 --> 01:01:30.530
<v Speaker 6>gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Forty gig for one file.</v>

1264
01:01:30.531 --> 01:01:31.550
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

1265
01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.920
<v Speaker 5>For what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just so I could have two hours of</v>

1266
01:01:33.921 --> 01:01:38.060
<v Speaker 5>gopro footage of me walking around ces</v>
<v Speaker 5>to whittle that down and it's like,</v>

1267
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:40.040
<v Speaker 5>what is the normal person going to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>with all that?</v>

1268
01:01:40.041 --> 01:01:43.430
<v Speaker 5>If they went to shoot their kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like they're going to have to have</v>

1269
01:01:43.431 --> 01:01:46.790
<v Speaker 5>so many hard drives are going to become</v>
<v Speaker 5>digital orders for sure.</v>

1270
01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:48.080
<v Speaker 6>YeaH.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1271
01:01:48.081 --> 01:01:50.360
<v Speaker 6>You're talking about actual physical</v>
<v Speaker 6>space now.</v>

1272
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:54.130
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is the benefit of that over like a</v>

1273
01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:58.100
<v Speaker 6>more standard hd format other than the</v>
<v Speaker 6>fact that just looks a little bit</v>

1274
01:01:58.101 --> 01:01:58.701
<v Speaker 6>better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1275
01:01:58.701 --> 01:02:01.170
<v Speaker 6>and really it is just a little bit like</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're.</v>

1276
01:02:01.171 --> 01:02:05.450
<v Speaker 6>You're really struggling between hd and</v>
<v Speaker 6>this four k.</v>

1277
01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.880
<v Speaker 6>It's like I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's better.</v>

1278
01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:10.430
<v Speaker 6>It's better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a smidge smidge better.</v>

1279
01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:13.700
<v Speaker 5>There was some eight k tvs at ces.</v>
<v Speaker 5>K?</v>

1280
01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:15.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those motherfuckers.</v>

1281
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.990
<v Speaker 5>Several cameras that shoot ne k now.</v>

1282
01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.420
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you thought you were safe with four</v>

1283
01:02:18.421 --> 01:02:21.450
<v Speaker 6>k now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's going to be 80 gigs for the same</v>

1284
01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:24.660
<v Speaker 6>video for at least fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

1285
01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:25.810
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's the.</v>

1286
01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:29.830
<v Speaker 5>That's kind of where we're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's no the distribution of</v>

1287
01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:32.620
<v Speaker 5>this content.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now b is b becomes the next step and the</v>

1288
01:02:32.621 --> 01:02:36.130
<v Speaker 5>next hurdle you have to get past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was looking around a lot at three 60</v>

1289
01:02:36.131 --> 01:02:39.790
<v Speaker 5>cameras because I just got that three 60</v>
<v Speaker 5>camera and did the test footage with the</v>

1290
01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:44.530
<v Speaker 5>way and that we did last week in the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't personally just like how the</v>

1291
01:02:44.531 --> 01:02:45.311
<v Speaker 5>footage looked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was.</v>

1292
01:02:45.311 --> 01:02:47.950
<v Speaker 5>I got a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a smudge on the screen which</v>

1293
01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.920
<v Speaker 5>transferred over and it doesn't look</v>
<v Speaker 5>very good and it wasn't at eye level and</v>

1294
01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:55.240
<v Speaker 5>I was shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe I was shooting that in four k.</v>

1295
01:02:55.510 --> 01:03:00.040
<v Speaker 5>It just looks a little grainy and messy</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so I was looking around that whole</v>

1296
01:03:00.041 --> 01:03:02.800
<v Speaker 5>event to just try to find.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because there were multiple,</v>

1297
01:03:02.801 --> 01:03:05.980
<v Speaker 5>three 60 cameras and multiple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was four k streaming,</v>

1298
01:03:05.981 --> 01:03:09.670
<v Speaker 5>three 60 cameras and you need to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They all have their own proprietary</v>

1299
01:03:09.671 --> 01:03:13.870
<v Speaker 5>software to run it off of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I did find one really good one which</v>

1300
01:03:13.871 --> 01:03:18.130
<v Speaker 5>does three d,</v>
<v Speaker 5>360 video,</v>

1301
01:03:19.330 --> 01:03:21.130
<v Speaker 5>which was really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really cool.</v>

1302
01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:23.980
<v Speaker 5>But I'm also wondering too if I saw</v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

1303
01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:28.450
<v Speaker 5>one really good edited video they made</v>
<v Speaker 5>to show it off or if I was actually</v>

1304
01:03:28.451 --> 01:03:31.450
<v Speaker 5>seeing this is basically exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 5>the camera does.</v>

1305
01:03:32.050 --> 01:03:35.560
<v Speaker 5>Straight like pretty much straight off</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it because it was really cool.</v>

1306
01:03:35.561 --> 01:03:39.040
<v Speaker 5>It's called the views camera and eye</v>
<v Speaker 5>contact</v>

1307
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:40.920
<v Speaker 6>you're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's when you're getting into really</v>

1308
01:03:40.921 --> 01:03:44.370
<v Speaker 6>bizarre stuff right when you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 6>about like eight k video and they need</v>

1309
01:03:44.371 --> 01:03:49.371
<v Speaker 6>to talk to you about 360 degree three d</v>
<v Speaker 6>because it seems like if we're going to</v>

1310
01:03:50.041 --> 01:03:54.000
<v Speaker 6>enter intO a real virtual realm anytime</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the near future,</v>

1311
01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:58.980
<v Speaker 6>all this ramping up of the specs or you</v>
<v Speaker 6>know going from four k to eight k and</v>

1312
01:03:58.981 --> 01:04:00.810
<v Speaker 6>then you know 32 k's just around the</v>
<v Speaker 6>corner.</v>

1313
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:02.880
<v Speaker 6>They're just going to keep getting</v>
<v Speaker 6>better at this shit.</v>

1314
01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.990
<v Speaker 6>And when you're talking about something</v>
<v Speaker 6>through like a high end glass,</v>

1315
01:04:06.991 --> 01:04:11.190
<v Speaker 6>like a really high end,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a binocular type class and then</v>

1316
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:16.280
<v Speaker 6>having insanely high definition video</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then having this exponential jump in</v>

1317
01:04:18.781 --> 01:04:23.400
<v Speaker 6>this virtual technology where they</v>
<v Speaker 6>figured out a way to really lock you</v>

1318
01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:27.770
<v Speaker 6>into something that is not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not invasive to the point where</v>

1319
01:04:27.771 --> 01:04:30.620
<v Speaker 6>it's not liKe fucking with your</v>
<v Speaker 6>experience by you feeling it on your</v>

1320
01:04:30.621 --> 01:04:32.150
<v Speaker 6>head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very light,</v>

1321
01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:34.220
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because sometimes you putting those</v>

1322
01:04:34.221 --> 01:04:36.400
<v Speaker 6>bulky headsets and the goggles,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1323
01:04:36.401 --> 01:04:39.200
<v Speaker 6>it's over your eyes like that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 6>shrink up to,</v>

1324
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:40.820
<v Speaker 6>that's going to shrink up to almost</v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing.</v>

1325
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:46.430
<v Speaker 6>And with um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with all these big jumps that they're</v>

1326
01:04:46.431 --> 01:04:49.760
<v Speaker 6>making,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how far away are we from some fully</v>

1327
01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:51.230
<v Speaker 6>immersive avatar world</v>

1328
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:55.583
<v Speaker 5>gotta be getting close.</v>

1329
01:04:56.230 --> 01:05:00.880
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what's going to be like an</v>

1330
01:05:00.881 --> 01:05:04.060
<v Speaker 6>avatar world that you could go go for a</v>
<v Speaker 6>journey in?</v>

1331
01:05:05.810 --> 01:05:09.250
<v Speaker 6>I mean imagine if movies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if what they become.</v>

1332
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:13.150
<v Speaker 6>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>think about how these serial shows like</v>

1333
01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:16.090
<v Speaker 6>sopranos and then ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1334
01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:18.850
<v Speaker 6>game oF and a lot of these other great</v>
<v Speaker 6>shows,</v>

1335
01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:22.810
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they catch you and they rope you in and</v>

1336
01:05:22.811 --> 01:05:27.811
<v Speaker 6>they bring you into a world and then you</v>
<v Speaker 6>follow that world episode after episode</v>

1337
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.490
<v Speaker 6>and you get sucked into it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1338
01:05:30.491 --> 01:05:32.890
<v Speaker 6>It's very different than a regular</v>
<v Speaker 6>movie.</v>

1339
01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.280
<v Speaker 6>What did they start doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>These cereal?</v>

1340
01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.070
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think of like game of thrones is a</v>

1341
01:05:39.071 --> 01:05:40.780
<v Speaker 6>serial movie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1342
01:05:40.781 --> 01:05:45.340
<v Speaker 6>There's a hundred parts to this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's a big giant ass movie.</v>

1343
01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:45.910
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1344
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:47.680
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's so much better than a regular</v>

1345
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:52.060
<v Speaker 6>television show in terms of like it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>special effects and the grandness of it</v>

1346
01:05:52.061 --> 01:05:52.894
<v Speaker 6>all.</v>

1347
01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:56.740
<v Speaker 6>If they can figure out how to film</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that,</v>

1348
01:05:56.741 --> 01:06:00.970
<v Speaker 6>but let you participate in it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1349
01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:05.650
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let you strap on to some three d</v>

1350
01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:10.830
<v Speaker 6>treadmill type thing and move around in</v>
<v Speaker 6>this fucking weird world and follow</v>

1351
01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:17.560
<v Speaker 6>these people on their journeys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Be right there when the orc slaughter</v>

1352
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:21.510
<v Speaker 6>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the blood splatter in front of you</v>

1353
01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:24.880
<v Speaker 6>and you're watching theM get chopped up</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you're going to go over the</v>

1354
01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:27.730
<v Speaker 6>mountain to where the castle is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to actually walk over the</v>

1355
01:06:27.731 --> 01:06:30.220
<v Speaker 6>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but as you walk over the mountain,</v>

1356
01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.830
<v Speaker 6>horses ride beside you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You get to see them.</v>

1357
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:35.063
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1358
01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:40.170
<v Speaker 6>we're real close to something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like that's only a few years</v>

1359
01:06:40.171 --> 01:06:41.004
<v Speaker 6>away.</v>

1360
01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:45.120
<v Speaker 4>Avatar world coming out soon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in disney at disney disney world.</v>

1361
01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.000
<v Speaker 4>What are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How's that going to work?</v>

1362
01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.420
<v Speaker 4>They've been showing some things like</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

1363
01:06:49.421 --> 01:06:52.990
<v Speaker 4>I think this is just a imagineering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa idea,</v>

1364
01:06:52.991 --> 01:06:55.940
<v Speaker 4>but just like you're gonna be able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>take a boat ride through the middle of</v>

1365
01:06:55.941 --> 01:06:57.260
<v Speaker 4>the navi forest.</v>

1366
01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:57.991
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

1367
01:06:57.991 --> 01:06:59.870
<v Speaker 6>Well that looks like it's a small world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1368
01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:03.040
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be a little bit of a step,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're going to have some vr stuff.</v>

1369
01:07:03.041 --> 01:07:05.880
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna be able to float through</v>
<v Speaker 4>and go on the uh,</v>

1370
01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:08.250
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's how they look and disney world</v>

1371
01:07:08.251 --> 01:07:09.840
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh wow.</v>

1372
01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:11.760
<v Speaker 4>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're building it right now.</v>

1373
01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:13.440
<v Speaker 4>You're obviously not going to have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>walk on that.</v>

1374
01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:17.850
<v Speaker 4>When is this going to take place?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it opens this later this year.</v>

1375
01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.550
<v Speaker 4>Disneyland does not next year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what you're saying,</v>

1376
01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.890
<v Speaker 4>what else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just took the extension of that and</v>

1377
01:07:22.891 --> 01:07:25.560
<v Speaker 4>just instead of like making the avatar</v>
<v Speaker 4>movie,</v>

1378
01:07:25.561 --> 01:07:26.311
<v Speaker 4>they just went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1379
01:07:26.311 --> 01:07:30.220
<v Speaker 4>avatar is avatar world and if you want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to come live it out,</v>

1380
01:07:30.221 --> 01:07:32.530
<v Speaker 4>you've got to come to disney world and</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay 50 bucks.</v>

1381
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:35.430
<v Speaker 4>100 bucks or $150 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>300 bucks.</v>

1382
01:07:35.770 --> 01:07:36.910
<v Speaker 4>Something crazy to do it.</v>

1383
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:39.590
<v Speaker 6>Now you're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That would be,</v>

1384
01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:43.820
<v Speaker 6>this is what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You construct that world and then once</v>

1385
01:07:43.821 --> 01:07:46.400
<v Speaker 6>you're in that world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you put on the vr goggles and it</v>

1386
01:07:46.401 --> 01:07:51.401
<v Speaker 6>turns everything into fluorescent neon</v>
<v Speaker 6>greens and blues and like the avatar</v>

1387
01:07:52.431 --> 01:07:55.070
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could see everything and then you</v>

1388
01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:57.170
<v Speaker 6>actually watched the movie play out in</v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

1389
01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:02.120
<v Speaker 4>That would be a nerd gas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like they're way closer to</v>

1390
01:08:02.121 --> 01:08:06.100
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we are everyone being able to do</v>

1391
01:08:06.101 --> 01:08:06.990
<v Speaker 4>with this app.</v>

1392
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.010
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the thing about that though is it's</v>

1393
01:08:09.011 --> 01:08:13.790
<v Speaker 6>going to require so much resources and</v>
<v Speaker 6>land and money and it's Just,</v>

1394
01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:17.940
<v Speaker 6>I feel like a three d treadmill and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1395
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:20.580
<v Speaker 6>where you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't phySically go anywhere,</v>

1396
01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.980
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to be able to go up</v>
<v Speaker 6>hills and you're not gonna,</v>

1397
01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:25.740
<v Speaker 6>you're not gonna feel a sensation of</v>
<v Speaker 6>walking,</v>

1398
01:08:25.741 --> 01:08:28.110
<v Speaker 6>climbing things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the only difference,</v>

1399
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:30.330
<v Speaker 6>but you'll be able to be like right in</v>
<v Speaker 6>front of it,</v>

1400
01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.910
<v Speaker 6>but it won't feel like grass.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

1401
01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:38.270
<v Speaker 6>Like if they could figure out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 6>do a virtual world where somehow or</v>

1402
01:08:39.631 --> 01:08:44.070
<v Speaker 6>another you could change the textiles on</v>
<v Speaker 6>the ground or changed the way it feels,</v>

1403
01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:47.160
<v Speaker 6>the tactile sensation of what you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>stepping on.</v>

1404
01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:51.360
<v Speaker 6>If you can make it feel like water.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you can make it feel like grass or</v>

1405
01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:54.840
<v Speaker 6>dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If they could start doing shit like</v>

1406
01:08:54.841 --> 01:08:56.610
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that doesn't seem outside.</v>

1407
01:08:56.611 --> 01:09:01.611
<v Speaker 6>The realm of possibility Just seems like</v>
<v Speaker 6>something way too smart for a dummy like</v>

1408
01:09:01.741 --> 01:09:02.530
<v Speaker 6>me to figure out.</v>

1409
01:09:02.530 --> 01:09:06.130
<v Speaker 5>So there's one technology at cds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a couple things there I didn't</v>

1410
01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.810
<v Speaker 5>get a chance to even see.</v>

1411
01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:13.080
<v Speaker 6>WHat does it say wants to let you feel</v>
<v Speaker 6>fabric through your touch screen?</v>

1412
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:14.570
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1413
01:09:14.571 --> 01:09:15.960
<v Speaker 6>I hand invis</v>

1414
01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.840
<v Speaker 5>I find it there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are a lot of places I think I was</v>

1415
01:09:18.841 --> 01:09:19.840
<v Speaker 5>trying to find that I couldn't hear</v>

1416
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:21.660
<v Speaker 6>and actually just find,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1417
01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:25.600
<v Speaker 6>dudes are going to use that for just</v>
<v Speaker 6>gonna rub girls' panties and porn films</v>

1418
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:28.180
<v Speaker 6>and it's going to be the only</v>
<v Speaker 6>application for it.</v>

1419
01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.120
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's right there.</v>

1420
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:32.530
<v Speaker 6>Touch it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The idea of it sounds pretty interesting</v>

1421
01:09:32.531 --> 01:09:33.370
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1422
01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:34.740
<v Speaker 6>I mean you can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can have a like a,</v>

1423
01:09:34.741 --> 01:09:38.500
<v Speaker 6>a bump to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So is it working on an ipad or something</v>

1424
01:09:38.501 --> 01:09:39.334
<v Speaker 6>with a.</v>

1425
01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.310
<v Speaker 5>It uses a little bit of like the haptic</v>
<v Speaker 5>feedback that is already built into some</v>

1426
01:09:43.311 --> 01:09:45.080
<v Speaker 5>of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it uses it differently.</v>

1427
01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.590
<v Speaker 6>So that was what it was kind of cool</v>
<v Speaker 6>about.</v>

1428
01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:51.040
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the htc vibe is that haptic feedback</v>

1429
01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:53.470
<v Speaker 6>because when you're doing the bow and</v>
<v Speaker 6>arrow thing,</v>

1430
01:09:53.471 --> 01:09:55.870
<v Speaker 6>it really does kind of feel like you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>drawing the arrow back,</v>

1431
01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:59.800
<v Speaker 6>gives you a little bit of vibration as</v>
<v Speaker 6>if the arrow is pulling across the arrow</v>

1432
01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:02.590
<v Speaker 6>restaurants rubbing on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really cool.</v>

1433
01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:05.720
<v Speaker 5>So they just made some announcements to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't,</v>

1434
01:10:05.721 --> 01:10:07.370
<v Speaker 5>they're not going to make a new vibe</v>
<v Speaker 5>yet,</v>

1435
01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.610
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they showed a new head set attachment</v>

1436
01:10:10.611 --> 01:10:14.340
<v Speaker 5>that makes the vibe put on your head a</v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit more comfortably and this</v>

1437
01:10:14.341 --> 01:10:17.270
<v Speaker 5>showed what they're calling the tracker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is essentially the end of the</v>

1438
01:10:17.271 --> 01:10:20.180
<v Speaker 5>controller which can be attached to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They said anything.</v>

1439
01:10:20.181 --> 01:10:22.490
<v Speaker 5>So it depends what a developer makes it</v>
<v Speaker 5>work with,</v>

1440
01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:26.840
<v Speaker 5>but one of the things they showed as it</v>
<v Speaker 5>were on the end of a gun told us to like</v>

1441
01:10:26.841 --> 01:10:31.520
<v Speaker 5>play different gun games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They put on the end of a baseball bat</v>

1442
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.353
<v Speaker 5>and a baseball bat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you could,</v>

1443
01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:35.390
<v Speaker 5>you could see the bat and the vive game</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you were playing or the baseball</v>

1444
01:10:35.391 --> 01:10:38.440
<v Speaker 5>simulation you were playing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they could pull in real major league</v>

1445
01:10:38.441 --> 01:10:41.390
<v Speaker 5>baseball pitches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>actual data because they have them all</v>

1446
01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:42.650
<v Speaker 5>from the last,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

1447
01:10:42.651 --> 01:10:45.920
<v Speaker 5>five to 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Any pitch from any picture you want to</v>

1448
01:10:45.921 --> 01:10:47.750
<v Speaker 5>see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can have now come at you and you can</v>

1449
01:10:47.751 --> 01:10:49.840
<v Speaker 5>go ahead and try to hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my god.</v>

1450
01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:53.060
<v Speaker 5>Probably then put you theoretically at</v>
<v Speaker 5>any park you want or wherever the hell</v>

1451
01:10:53.061 --> 01:10:54.530
<v Speaker 5>you want to be swinging baseball bats.</v>

1452
01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.070
<v Speaker 6>How many dudes are going to be blown</v>
<v Speaker 6>their shoulders apart?</v>

1453
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:59.500
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>swinging in the air with this thing,</v>

1454
01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:02.350
<v Speaker 6>hopefully you're not bashing your house</v>
<v Speaker 6>up to,</v>

1455
01:11:02.351 --> 01:11:06.610
<v Speaker 6>but like that idea can be expounded on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now would you,</v>

1456
01:11:06.611 --> 01:11:08.380
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would think that if you were going to</v>

1457
01:11:08.381 --> 01:11:11.290
<v Speaker 6>do something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you would want to do it with a bat</v>

1458
01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:13.800
<v Speaker 6>that's like the same weight as a real</v>
<v Speaker 6>bat.</v>

1459
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:17.880
<v Speaker 5>You'd probably want the x.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had an actual wooden baseball bat.</v>

1460
01:11:17.881 --> 01:11:19.260
<v Speaker 5>They just screwed the thing on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>bottom.</v>

1461
01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:20.460
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's great.</v>

1462
01:11:20.461 --> 01:11:22.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you could do it with that.</v>

1463
01:11:22.471 --> 01:11:24.180
<v Speaker 5>You could probably have a sword.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could probably have a.</v>

1464
01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.110
<v Speaker 6>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1465
01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:28.390
<v Speaker 6>If you had a sword,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you know,</v>

1466
01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.490
<v Speaker 6>kind of a fucking awesome workout you</v>
<v Speaker 6>would get.</v>

1467
01:11:30.730 --> 01:11:34.900
<v Speaker 6>My arms were so tired at dunkin's place</v>
<v Speaker 6>just for playing his archery thing and</v>

1468
01:11:34.901 --> 01:11:38.410
<v Speaker 6>I'm not even pulling anything back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just holding my arm up.</v>

1469
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:40.990
<v Speaker 6>Like there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no actual resistance pulling the</v>

1470
01:11:40.991 --> 01:11:43.810
<v Speaker 6>bow back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but just holding your arms straight in</v>

1471
01:11:43.811 --> 01:11:46.450
<v Speaker 6>front of you and doing this over and</v>
<v Speaker 6>over again.</v>

1472
01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.010
<v Speaker 6>my arms were killing me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1473
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:49.330
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is amazing.</v>

1474
01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:52.480
<v Speaker 6>Like this actually has some physical</v>
<v Speaker 6>benefit to it.</v>

1475
01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:56.590
<v Speaker 6>And the boxing game,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the boxing game has real benefit to it.</v>

1476
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:58.750
<v Speaker 6>Like the boxing game,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you could,</v>

1477
01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:03.070
<v Speaker 6>you could learn how a person moves and</v>
<v Speaker 6>how it feels like to spar with them.</v>

1478
01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:06.220
<v Speaker 6>You see punches come at,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can learn how to slip punches,</v>

1479
01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.080
<v Speaker 6>you can learn how to counter with</v>
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

1480
01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:11.700
<v Speaker 6>You don't feel hitting anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the only thing that's missing and</v>

1481
01:12:11.701 --> 01:12:14.080
<v Speaker 6>you don't feel them hitting you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But at least when they hit you,</v>

1482
01:12:14.081 --> 01:12:14.980
<v Speaker 6>you see like spark.</v>

1483
01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:15.910
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1484
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:18.550
<v Speaker 5>one of the try to find that a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 5>really.</v>

1485
01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.200
<v Speaker 5>It's not worth me pumped the video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

1486
01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:25.260
<v Speaker 5>there was a haptic feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a essentially a backpack slash chest</v>

1487
01:12:25.811 --> 01:12:30.811
<v Speaker 5>thing you put on for vr that would give</v>
<v Speaker 5>you some sort of shocks or you'd feel</v>

1488
01:12:30.851 --> 01:12:33.550
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how hard it would feel</v>

1489
01:12:33.551 --> 01:12:35.710
<v Speaker 5>should jolt the shit out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was another,</v>

1490
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:41.050
<v Speaker 5>there's a company that in the video I</v>
<v Speaker 5>watched showing the data trackers that</v>

1491
01:12:41.051 --> 01:12:42.330
<v Speaker 5>they were adding onto different,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1492
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.610
<v Speaker 5>devices.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They put it on a fire hose and they also</v>

1493
01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:47.800
<v Speaker 5>put a jacket on you that had heaters in</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1494
01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.130
<v Speaker 5>So your boy putting out a fire and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's given you feedback of the hose.</v>

1495
01:12:51.250 --> 01:12:53.350
<v Speaker 5>It's also getting warmer and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting hot.</v>

1496
01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:55.320
<v Speaker 5>So like there's different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1497
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:59.050
<v Speaker 5>that's not really a game as more of it</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a simulation or it is a training</v>

1498
01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.780
<v Speaker 5>training tool for an actual fire</v>
<v Speaker 5>company.</v>

1499
01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:03.530
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's also to let you know like what's</v>

1500
01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.620
<v Speaker 6>the potential for like a doom game from</v>
<v Speaker 6>2000</v>

1501
01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.060
<v Speaker 5>for 24.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1502
01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.030
<v Speaker 5>Maybe not even.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe two years from now.</v>

1503
01:13:10.031 --> 01:13:12.940
<v Speaker 5>Hopefully we'll see what happens at e</v>
<v Speaker 5>three this year with what these</v>

1504
01:13:12.941 --> 01:13:16.900
<v Speaker 5>companies are going to announce with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>new xbox is supposedly supposedly going</v>

1505
01:13:16.901 --> 01:13:17.740
<v Speaker 5>to have a vr.</v>

1506
01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:22.950
<v Speaker 6>If someone comes up with a haptic</v>
<v Speaker 6>feedback suit that's able to get hot and</v>

1507
01:13:23.191 --> 01:13:27.720
<v Speaker 6>cold and vibrate and jolt and even give</v>
<v Speaker 6>you a little bit of pain.</v>

1508
01:13:28.090 --> 01:13:29.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you need something,</v>

1509
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:33.510
<v Speaker 6>you need a little bit of pain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a little fucker,</v>

1510
01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:35.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where you're really feeling it.</v>

1511
01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:37.040
<v Speaker 5>Remember that was that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1512
01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:40.310
<v Speaker 5>I don't know which James Bond movie it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was where they were holding on to the.</v>

1513
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:44.010
<v Speaker 5>There's some sort of like stick they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>holding onto and like the loser,</v>

1514
01:13:44.011 --> 01:13:45.900
<v Speaker 5>it just gets more painful and like</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying.</v>

1515
01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:49.050
<v Speaker 5>It's like a man man versus man contest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a bunch of,</v>

1516
01:13:49.150 --> 01:13:50.250
<v Speaker 5>like at a cocktail party.</v>

1517
01:13:50.530 --> 01:13:52.190
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember that one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

1518
01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:54.460
<v Speaker 6>I avoided a lot of those James Bond</v>
<v Speaker 6>movies.</v>

1519
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:58.690
<v Speaker 6>Eddie bravo said something to me a long</v>
<v Speaker 6>time ago and it fucked me up.</v>

1520
01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.980
<v Speaker 6>We were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1521
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:04.330
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't a conspiracy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were talking about,</v>

1522
01:14:04.331 --> 01:14:06.610
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like action movies and he's like,</v>

1523
01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:10.270
<v Speaker 6>the problem with this action movies is</v>
<v Speaker 6>you always know who's going to live.</v>

1524
01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:12.790
<v Speaker 6>The guys always going to live like he</v>
<v Speaker 6>never.</v>

1525
01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:15.190
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's going to hang by fucking thread.</v>

1526
01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.510
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's gonna make it.</v>

1527
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:18.670
<v Speaker 6>He's gonna live,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know he's going to live.</v>

1528
01:14:19.210 --> 01:14:20.610
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you motherfucker.</v>

1529
01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:24.460
<v Speaker 6>Like I knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course I knew that you go to see the</v>

1530
01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:27.700
<v Speaker 6>terminator or you go to see a predator.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't think that arnold</v>

1531
01:14:27.701 --> 01:14:29.980
<v Speaker 6>schwarzenegger is going to get killed by</v>
<v Speaker 6>the alien at the end.</v>

1532
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:33.340
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You think that's actually really bad for</v>

1533
01:14:33.341 --> 01:14:34.174
<v Speaker 6>us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>isn't it?</v>

1534
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:39.820
<v Speaker 6>It's really bad to have the the good guy</v>
<v Speaker 6>when and all of them.</v>

1535
01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:43.450
<v Speaker 6>That's why I think like no country for</v>
<v Speaker 6>old men is probably important.</v>

1536
01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:47.860
<v Speaker 6>So important to know that sometimes the</v>
<v Speaker 6>guy who you think's gonna live gets shot</v>

1537
01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:51.370
<v Speaker 6>in the last couple of minutes of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>movie and the other guy just wanders off</v>

1538
01:14:51.371 --> 01:14:53.590
<v Speaker 6>spoiler,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's the end of the movie and</v>

1539
01:14:53.591 --> 01:14:55.660
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck kind of movie is this?</v>

1540
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:58.180
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a movie that's more like a real</v>

1541
01:14:58.181 --> 01:15:02.050
<v Speaker 6>live story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Arnold can't beat that alien.</v>

1542
01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.180
<v Speaker 6>You know it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know it.</v>

1543
01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:04.510
<v Speaker 6>That thing's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck him up.</v>

1544
01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:09.160
<v Speaker 6>Why are we pretending this is stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not a world where I can imagine</v>

1545
01:15:09.161 --> 01:15:13.570
<v Speaker 6>that predator losing to arnold</v>
<v Speaker 6>schwartzenegger I can't see,</v>

1546
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:15.820
<v Speaker 6>aren't ongoing at the donald.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The other day,</v>

1547
01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:18.220
<v Speaker 6>no I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I can't believe that donald wanted</v>

1548
01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.490
<v Speaker 6>arnold.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's the god damn president sir.</v>

1549
01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:24.670
<v Speaker 6>Down of course.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well he see he compared it to his first</v>

1550
01:15:24.671 --> 01:15:25.990
<v Speaker 6>season,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1551
01:15:25.991 --> 01:15:28.180
<v Speaker 6>and then all the 15 seasons he did</v>
<v Speaker 6>afterwards,</v>

1552
01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:31.420
<v Speaker 6>they fired him from that show for</v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about mexicans.</v>

1553
01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:34.750
<v Speaker 6>Did you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's when they fired him.</v>

1554
01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:38.710
<v Speaker 6>They fired him from that show and he's</v>
<v Speaker 6>still the executive producer.</v>

1555
01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.710
<v Speaker 6>So he's talking shit about a show that</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's still the executive producer of.</v>

1556
01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:45.970
<v Speaker 6>How is he allowed to be a producer?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He gets his fucking friends.</v>

1557
01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:50.230
<v Speaker 6>I don't know all the rules about that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I thought there were rules about</v>

1558
01:15:50.231 --> 01:15:53.320
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's probably going to step down now</v>

1559
01:15:53.321 --> 01:15:54.570
<v Speaker 6>that he's president.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1560
01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:56.830
<v Speaker 6>He said he was going to do a step down</v>
<v Speaker 6>from a bunch of shit.</v>

1561
01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:57.760
<v Speaker 6>Now that he's president,</v>

1562
01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:01.720
<v Speaker 6>it'll dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's going to be weird.</v>

1563
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:04.710
<v Speaker 6>Fucking for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be weird and he's going to</v>

1564
01:16:04.711 --> 01:16:08.380
<v Speaker 6>be weird during the weirdest era ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's next friday,</v>

1565
01:16:08.381 --> 01:16:09.214
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

1566
01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.670
<v Speaker 6>Twentieth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Soon as he gets into place.</v>

1567
01:16:11.690 --> 01:16:15.800
<v Speaker 6>You think's going to happen that day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So paint the white house black house,</v>

1568
01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:17.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>open up right in front.</v>

1569
01:16:17.290 --> 01:16:22.120
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be like a river of lava.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does that the actual end of the world</v>

1570
01:16:22.121 --> 01:16:24.880
<v Speaker 6>day?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1571
01:16:24.881 --> 01:16:27.070
<v Speaker 6>The mayans were only off by four or five</v>
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>

1572
01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:30.100
<v Speaker 6>They were off by a little.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What did they think?</v>

1573
01:16:30.101 --> 01:16:31.520
<v Speaker 6>December 20.</v>
<v Speaker 6>First 2012.</v>

1574
01:16:31.521 --> 01:16:34.220
<v Speaker 6>So they were off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were off a little four years.</v>

1575
01:16:34.221 --> 01:16:34.971
<v Speaker 6>In a month.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1576
01:16:34.971 --> 01:16:37.490
<v Speaker 6>Not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not that bad.</v>

1577
01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.850
<v Speaker 6>They might sit a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They did it thousands years ago,</v>

1578
01:16:40.851 --> 01:16:43.580
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Few fucking guessing thousands of years</v>

1579
01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:46.640
<v Speaker 6>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Me and I wonder if there really is like</v>

1580
01:16:46.641 --> 01:16:51.140
<v Speaker 6>a cycle where a civilizations just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

1581
01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:56.210
<v Speaker 6>they get to a point where all the monkey</v>
<v Speaker 6>shit that led them to scratch and scrape</v>

1582
01:16:57.531 --> 01:17:02.531
<v Speaker 6>and dominate and procreate and get to a</v>
<v Speaker 6>point where they have a city and finally</v>

1583
01:17:03.921 --> 01:17:05.120
<v Speaker 6>get a little bit of safety.</v>

1584
01:17:05.210 --> 01:17:08.990
<v Speaker 6>All of that just bites it in the ass</v>
<v Speaker 6>because all those,</v>

1585
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:11.930
<v Speaker 6>even though you've gotten past the</v>
<v Speaker 6>monkey existence,</v>

1586
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:16.130
<v Speaker 6>all those monkey dna,</v>
<v Speaker 6>human reward systems,</v>

1587
01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:20.090
<v Speaker 6>they're all still in place and they</v>
<v Speaker 6>still make you want to chase the same</v>

1588
01:17:20.091 --> 01:17:22.880
<v Speaker 6>shit that people chased thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago.</v>

1589
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:27.910
<v Speaker 6>Conquest and domination and control the</v>
<v Speaker 6>food supply and now that I'm president,</v>

1590
01:17:29.931 --> 01:17:34.931
<v Speaker 6>I'll have all the gold</v>
<v Speaker 6>that need for competition.</v>

1591
01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:40.250
<v Speaker 6>That's going to be one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 6>that I think technology is probably</v>

1592
01:17:40.251 --> 01:17:45.251
<v Speaker 6>going to neutralize first.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that when You get,</v>

1593
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:52.110
<v Speaker 6>when you get a hive mind type scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is a hive mind or a virtual</v>

1594
01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:57.970
<v Speaker 6>virtual worlds scenario where it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>literally preferable to this world,</v>

1595
01:17:58.150 --> 01:18:03.100
<v Speaker 6>like why would you want to hang around</v>
<v Speaker 6>and just go to west hills and get lunch</v>

1596
01:18:03.101 --> 01:18:06.280
<v Speaker 6>at some shitty place and wait in this</v>
<v Speaker 6>thing and then go to the movie.</v>

1597
01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:09.580
<v Speaker 6>Why would you even want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you get all your food through an</v>

1598
01:18:09.581 --> 01:18:13.570
<v Speaker 6>ivy and you're going to live in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>avatar world for a couple of weeks,</v>

1599
01:18:15.630 --> 01:18:17.010
<v Speaker 6>lot of people would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>

1600
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:20.440
<v Speaker 6>Damn food would probably be the only</v>
<v Speaker 6>problem,</v>

1601
01:18:20.441 --> 01:18:24.000
<v Speaker 6>like food and taking a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's not a black mirror episode.</v>

1602
01:18:24.001 --> 01:18:26.140
<v Speaker 6>You just started saying it had another</v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

1603
01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:28.740
<v Speaker 6>It's happened from time to time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you just start going down a concept</v>

1604
01:18:28.741 --> 01:18:31.180
<v Speaker 6>and it's like that's a black mirror</v>
<v Speaker 6>episode.</v>

1605
01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:32.740
<v Speaker 6>Original fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1606
01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.970
<v Speaker 6>what can I say?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was just an idea that you can go live</v>

1607
01:18:35.971 --> 01:18:38.100
<v Speaker 6>in another,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in another place that's going to happen</v>

1608
01:18:38.101 --> 01:18:40.110
<v Speaker 6>that amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's the name of that episode?</v>

1609
01:18:40.111 --> 01:18:44.250
<v Speaker 6>I want to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>San junipero I think is that one gonna</v>

1610
01:18:44.251 --> 01:18:47.820
<v Speaker 6>happen man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just a matter of time and when it</v>

1611
01:18:47.821 --> 01:18:50.370
<v Speaker 6>does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it might be a complete mental</v>

1612
01:18:50.371 --> 01:18:52.560
<v Speaker 6>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you might get out of this and you</v>

1613
01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:55.680
<v Speaker 6>might be like those poor guys who come</v>
<v Speaker 6>back after a space walks,</v>

1614
01:18:56.370 --> 01:18:58.110
<v Speaker 6>you know those guys at are up there.</v>

1615
01:18:58.110 --> 01:19:03.110
<v Speaker 6>LIke I'm a hatfield commander hatfield.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had him on the podcast and he was</v>

1616
01:19:04.051 --> 01:19:08.070
<v Speaker 6>describing after being.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he was up for six months.</v>

1617
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:11.310
<v Speaker 6>I think so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a long fucking time and when he</v>

1618
01:19:11.311 --> 01:19:16.110
<v Speaker 6>came back down like his body's brittle</v>
<v Speaker 6>takes like a year for your bone density</v>

1619
01:19:16.111 --> 01:19:17.430
<v Speaker 6>to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you're,</v>

1620
01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.740
<v Speaker 6>you're a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't stand.</v>

1621
01:19:19.950 --> 01:19:22.770
<v Speaker 6>He's throwing up all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your whole body.</v>

1622
01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:25.860
<v Speaker 6>So baffled because you've been up in</v>
<v Speaker 6>space for six months.</v>

1623
01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:30.880
<v Speaker 6>Like those guys make a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 6>sacrifice so that we can understand like</v>

1624
01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:33.690
<v Speaker 6>what happens to people's bodies and zero</v>
<v Speaker 6>gravity,</v>

1625
01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:39.180
<v Speaker 6>like all these people that are signing</v>
<v Speaker 6>up to go to mars and want to go on all</v>

1626
01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.910
<v Speaker 6>these journeys and space like settle the</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck down.</v>

1627
01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:44.980
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We might be able to go to better spots</v>

1628
01:19:44.981 --> 01:19:47.310
<v Speaker 6>and we just stay right here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We need to put a,</v>

1629
01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:49.680
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a roof on this thing.</v>

1630
01:19:50.010 --> 01:19:53.640
<v Speaker 6>We got rocks flying in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Need to put a god damn roof on the</v>

1631
01:19:53.641 --> 01:19:58.641
<v Speaker 6>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Build that first big ass thick roof with</v>

1632
01:19:59.611 --> 01:20:02.490
<v Speaker 6>lcd screens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So at the bottom of it,</v>

1633
01:20:02.491 --> 01:20:05.580
<v Speaker 6>It just shows nothing but beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 6>skies.</v>

1634
01:20:05.730 --> 01:20:07.890
<v Speaker 6>Everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's going to be like</v>

1635
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:13.040
<v Speaker 3>the truman show</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's gonna be a big scoop that</v>

1636
01:20:13.351 --> 01:20:15.270
<v Speaker 3>catches all the rain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rain is going to fall on the</v>

1637
01:20:15.271 --> 01:20:18.510
<v Speaker 3>outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to get funneled through,</v>

1638
01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:23.550
<v Speaker 3>but we need like a four foot wall now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't even matter.</v>

1639
01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:26.430
<v Speaker 3>The the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of asteroids that killed the</v>

1640
01:20:26.431 --> 01:20:28.980
<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they said something crazy like</v>

1641
01:20:28.981 --> 01:20:31.650
<v Speaker 3>it was five miles deep into the earth</v>
<v Speaker 3>within the first half.</v>

1642
01:20:31.651 --> 01:20:34.200
<v Speaker 3>A second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1643
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:38.250
<v Speaker 3>I might've made those numbers up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's in that range where it's so</v>

1644
01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:40.800
<v Speaker 3>preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I rememBer hearing this guy speak about</v>

1645
01:20:40.801 --> 01:20:45.801
<v Speaker 3>it and talking about just the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The impact that the earth rang for a</v>

1646
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:48.343
<v Speaker 3>million years.</v>

1647
01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.673
<v Speaker 7>Bob</v>

1648
01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:56.930
<v Speaker 3>rang from the impact for a million years</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1649
01:20:58.550 --> 01:21:02.150
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is that like so we can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>really have a.</v>

1650
01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:04.900
<v Speaker 3>We need something better than a roof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm trying to say.</v>

1651
01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:07.190
<v Speaker 3>Work on that first and you got damn</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtual reality.</v>

1652
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:12.030
<v Speaker 3>Then think about going to mars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to richard dawkins talk</v>

1653
01:21:12.031 --> 01:21:14.390
<v Speaker 3>to sam harris today on this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very interesting,</v>

1654
01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.810
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things that we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about is people going to mars and if</v>

1655
01:21:17.811 --> 01:21:21.470
<v Speaker 3>they did colonize mars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the genes on mars would not be in</v>

1656
01:21:21.471 --> 01:21:25.700
<v Speaker 3>contact with the jeans back here on</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth and would human beings go off in</v>

1657
01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:30.760
<v Speaker 3>different directions and then on top of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that genetic manipulation once genetic</v>

1658
01:21:31.161 --> 01:21:35.060
<v Speaker 3>manipulation gets perfected and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>start really fucking with people's dna</v>

1659
01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:38.960
<v Speaker 3>and really changing what people look</v>
<v Speaker 3>like and what,</v>

1660
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:42.440
<v Speaker 3>how they can perform and how their</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brains work was going to be like in</v>

1661
01:21:42.441 --> 01:21:45.830
<v Speaker 3>comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the guys that are doing tHat on</v>

1662
01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:47.720
<v Speaker 3>earth versus the people that are doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it on mars.</v>

1663
01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:51.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's weird.</v>

1664
01:21:51.421 --> 01:21:53.680
<v Speaker 4>I ended.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The atmosphere is obviously different in</v>

1665
01:21:53.681 --> 01:21:58.300
<v Speaker 4>general because of the way it's really</v>
<v Speaker 4>grow and just be different.</v>

1666
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:02.650
<v Speaker 4>He can't breathe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to somehow or another they're</v>

1667
01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:04.150
<v Speaker 4>going to have to terraform,</v>

1668
01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:09.210
<v Speaker 3>create an atmosphere or um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna have to put some kind of a</v>

1669
01:22:10.450 --> 01:22:14.140
<v Speaker 3>like domes up and live inside the domes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is terrifying.</v>

1670
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:18.290
<v Speaker 4>What is that kai?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like,</v>

1671
01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:21.600
<v Speaker 4>was it an interstellar where they made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We didn't like,</v>

1672
01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:23.520
<v Speaker 4>we call it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't colonize planets,</v>

1673
01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:28.521
<v Speaker 4>but we've made life floating terraform</v>
<v Speaker 4>cylinders and we lived on those.</v>

1674
01:22:28.730 --> 01:22:29.580
<v Speaker 4>Is that what that was?</v>

1675
01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:33.350
<v Speaker 3>I didn't watch that whole movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to most mostly did that movie and</v>

1676
01:22:33.351 --> 01:22:34.520
<v Speaker 3>I fell asleep on a plane.</v>

1677
01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:39.640
<v Speaker 4>So you didn't see the end and seeing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that movie at the chinese theater was</v>

1678
01:22:39.650 --> 01:22:44.390
<v Speaker 4>where I saw it done in hollywood when he</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes and they go into the black hole and</v>

1679
01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:47.240
<v Speaker 4>I remember even reading,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where Christopher Nolan was t</v>

1680
01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:49.820
<v Speaker 4>test watching that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so loud.</v>

1681
01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:53.270
<v Speaker 4>So big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It made that such an awesome experience.</v>

1682
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:56.960
<v Speaker 4>Chinese theaters I'd love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love to see it makes bad movies.</v>

1683
01:22:56.961 --> 01:22:57.270
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

1684
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:58.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw pulp fiction.</v>

1685
01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:01.410
<v Speaker 3>There was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit.</v>

1686
01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:05.770
<v Speaker 3>That was when pulp fiction first came</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and this was like 90 or something.</v>

1687
01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:07.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1688
01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:10.900

<v Speaker 2>but that matt damon movie the martian</v>

1689
01:23:10.901 --> 01:23:14.500
<v Speaker 2>was all about terraforming and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>survive on mars.</v>

1690
01:23:14.501 --> 01:23:16.420
<v Speaker 2>Did you watch the arrival yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must have watched that.</v>

1691
01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:17.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1692
01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:19.090

<v Speaker 2>It hurts really good though.</v>

1693
01:23:19.690 --> 01:23:21.910
<v Speaker 2>it looks really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that kind of came and went,</v>

1694
01:23:21.911 --> 01:23:24.880
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean kind of events that just how it</v>

1695
01:23:24.881 --> 01:23:26.800
<v Speaker 2>goes now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's too fast.</v>

1696
01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Things are too good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too much that people want to watch them</v>

1697
01:23:29.591 --> 01:23:30.850
<v Speaker 2>at home now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1698
01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.370
<v Speaker 2>That too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to start allowing that to</v>

1699
01:23:33.371 --> 01:23:36.130
<v Speaker 2>happen I think are charged with more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1700
01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Charging 50 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1701
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's figured out how to get through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

1702
01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:44.110
<v Speaker 2>well maybe they have get through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>apple tv and downloaded.</v>

1703
01:23:44.111 --> 01:23:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Have they like to steal from that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1704
01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.780
<v Speaker 2>You don't like to steal from that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just ask.</v>

1705
01:23:49.810 --> 01:23:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming you mean steal from them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1706
01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1707
01:23:52.841 --> 01:23:54.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody's been able to do</v>

1708
01:23:54.551 --> 01:23:55.384
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they have,</v>

1709
01:23:55.570 --> 01:23:58.750
<v Speaker 2>but like when you're streaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're streaming,</v>

1710
01:23:58.810 --> 01:24:00.520
<v Speaker 2>I guess if you were streaming to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>

1711
01:24:00.521 --> 01:24:03.610
<v Speaker 2>that might be a way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A screen capture and some sort of way.</v>

1712
01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:05.960
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe not.</v>

1713
01:24:05.961 --> 01:24:07.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't know because they have it built</v>
<v Speaker 5>into the.</v>

1714
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:10.730
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess it's streaming a lot of the htmi</v>

1715
01:24:10.731 --> 01:24:12.440
<v Speaker 5>cable is now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1716
01:24:12.441 --> 01:24:14.630
<v Speaker 5>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you have your xbox or your,</v>

1717
01:24:14.631 --> 01:24:17.690
<v Speaker 5>another system hooked up to something</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you're trying to do game capturing</v>

1718
01:24:17.691 --> 01:24:19.580
<v Speaker 5>onto like Broadcast on twitch or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

1719
01:24:20.150 --> 01:24:24.950
<v Speaker 5>If you bring up a video or like your tv</v>
<v Speaker 5>turns on it goes black because it knows</v>

1720
01:24:24.951 --> 01:24:29.090
<v Speaker 5>that that signal is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not supposed to be broadcast.</v>

1721
01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:33.130
<v Speaker 5>It's not tHe game signal at the tv</v>
<v Speaker 5>signal and you'll probably people's</v>

1722
01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:36.290
<v Speaker 5>trying to show tv online,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it knows that you're trying to or</v>

1723
01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.300
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They put the dispute that stop in there.</v>

1724
01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1725
01:24:40.050 --> 01:24:40.900
<v Speaker 2>Be removed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1726
01:24:40.901 --> 01:24:44.610
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like there's gotta be a way</v>

1727
01:24:44.611 --> 01:24:48.360
<v Speaker 2>to take apple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're using your computer,</v>

1728
01:24:48.361 --> 01:24:51.120
<v Speaker 2>you can use a regular computer and watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>things on itunes,</v>

1729
01:24:51.121 --> 01:24:51.954
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>

1730
01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:53.940
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1731
01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you were using a regular computer</v>

1732
01:24:56.791 --> 01:25:01.110
<v Speaker 2>and you were streaming a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's gotta be a way that you</v>

1733
01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:03.720
<v Speaker 2>would be able to screen capture that</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your computer.</v>

1734
01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:04.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1735
01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:06.900
<v Speaker 2>But just open up a program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean record?</v>

1736
01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.060
<v Speaker 2>Just record it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1737
01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then would have just some big ass</v>

1738
01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:12.450
<v Speaker 2>file that would be like the hobbit or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the hell you were screened</v>

1739
01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:14.370
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's probably a way they can put in</v>

1740
01:25:14.371 --> 01:25:19.050
<v Speaker 2>some sort of digital rights management</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that it will put brian record to</v>

1741
01:25:19.051 --> 01:25:23.790
<v Speaker 2>that or it'll put of big watermark on if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to do that or maybe not.</v>

1742
01:25:23.791 --> 01:25:26.730
<v Speaker 2>And then someone will hack away to</v>
<v Speaker 2>against it and that that's like a battle</v>

1743
01:25:26.731 --> 01:25:29.580
<v Speaker 2>probably going onto the battle that will</v>
<v Speaker 2>go on forever,</v>

1744
01:25:29.581 --> 01:25:30.414
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1745
01:25:30.630 --> 01:25:32.850
<v Speaker 2>I'll just make a new file format and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then</v>

1746
01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:36.900
<v Speaker 5>videos will be in that file format for</v>
<v Speaker 5>the next five years until it gets</v>

1747
01:25:36.901 --> 01:25:37.734
<v Speaker 5>hacked.</v>

1748
01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:42.880
<v Speaker 2>Keep playing cat and mouse games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really interesting when we</v>

1749
01:25:42.881 --> 01:25:47.690
<v Speaker 2>were looking at that video or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>article rather about the people that</v>

1750
01:25:47.691 --> 01:25:52.691
<v Speaker 2>we're transmitting ola and chow back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth through the internet.</v>

1751
01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:56.930
<v Speaker 2>And then think about this kind of stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're talking about,</v>

1752
01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.650
<v Speaker 2>like really high level digital</v>
<v Speaker 2>management.</v>

1753
01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:04.670
<v Speaker 2>He putting out four k are you streaming</v>

1754
01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:07.940
<v Speaker 6>movies and people are trying to steal it</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

1755
01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:11.810
<v Speaker 6>think about all the bit torrents and all</v>
<v Speaker 6>the different files that are available</v>

1756
01:26:11.811 --> 01:26:14.570
<v Speaker 6>online when it comes to all these movies</v>
<v Speaker 6>and hollywood studios.</v>

1757
01:26:14.571 --> 01:26:17.260
<v Speaker 6>Pen spend millions of dollars to make</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then boom,</v>

1758
01:26:17.261 --> 01:26:22.261
<v Speaker 6>a screeners online like moments before</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's released and like this constant</v>

1759
01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:25.600
<v Speaker 6>battle of technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just,</v>

1760
01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:29.590
<v Speaker 6>it's really crazy because we could just</v>
<v Speaker 6>sit here and like just show up at this</v>

1761
01:26:29.591 --> 01:26:31.210
<v Speaker 6>ces.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't have to participate at all.</v>

1762
01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:33.040
<v Speaker 6>Show up every year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What you got now?</v>

1763
01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.170
<v Speaker 6>One year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you got now?</v>

1764
01:26:35.171 --> 01:26:36.820
<v Speaker 6>Can you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can you read my mind yet?</v>

1765
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.870
<v Speaker 6>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not yet.</v>

1766
01:26:38.010 --> 01:26:39.820
<v Speaker 6>I'll see you in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What about now?</v>

1767
01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:43.660
<v Speaker 6>Will we can't read your mind but we can</v>
<v Speaker 6>send you images.</v>

1768
01:26:43.810 --> 01:26:45.010
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll see you in a year.</v>

1769
01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:48.760
<v Speaker 6>Can you read my mind yet?</v>
<v Speaker 6>he just keep going back.</v>

1770
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.560
<v Speaker 6>Like you don't have to do any work.</v>

1771
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:54.190
<v Speaker 6>Like no one gets mad at us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not like the people in the village</v>

1772
01:26:54.191 --> 01:26:57.100
<v Speaker 6>that had to go get the water.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you drink water every day.</v>

1773
01:26:57.101 --> 01:26:59.230
<v Speaker 6>You fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you never go and get water and they</v>

1774
01:26:59.231 --> 01:27:02.230
<v Speaker 6>never asked you to get water.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just got to give them money and</v>

1775
01:27:02.231 --> 01:27:04.150
<v Speaker 6>they'll just keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just show up every week and they</v>

1776
01:27:04.151 --> 01:27:05.440
<v Speaker 6>never go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what do I have here?</v>

1777
01:27:05.441 --> 01:27:07.550
<v Speaker 6>What do you have for me?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you have for me?</v>

1778
01:27:07.551 --> 01:27:09.320
<v Speaker 6>If you want to see my mind reading</v>
<v Speaker 6>machine,</v>

1779
01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:11.660
<v Speaker 6>I got money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not good enough.</v>

1780
01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:14.330
<v Speaker 6>NoBody ever says that it now like you</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't have to.</v>

1781
01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:19.430
<v Speaker 6>You literally don't have to participate</v>
<v Speaker 6>in it to enjoy the benefits of it.</v>

1782
01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.750
<v Speaker 6>It's a rare thing.</v>

1783
01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:24.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to think of a,</v>

1784
01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:31.280
<v Speaker 5>like at the end of the car companies</v>
<v Speaker 5>outside was showing some stuff,</v>

1785
01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:36.470
<v Speaker 5>but it was super.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like a call to the statue,</v>

1786
01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:40.510
<v Speaker 5>but it was supposed to be an actual</v>
<v Speaker 5>model of a car.</v>

1787
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:44.900
<v Speaker 6>They called the car statue because it</v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't have a drive train in it.</v>

1788
01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:49.730
<v Speaker 5>There were people sitting in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was supposed to look like whatever a</v>

1789
01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:51.560
<v Speaker 5>future thing was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the girl that kept,</v>

1790
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:54.110
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was telling you what was going on</v>

1791
01:27:54.111 --> 01:27:56.400
<v Speaker 5>and explaining things to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She kept calling.</v>

1792
01:27:56.450 --> 01:27:58.880
<v Speaker 5>She kept referring to the car as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>statue.</v>

1793
01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:01.820
<v Speaker 5>I thought that was weird because I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've tried to show it to you before.</v>

1794
01:28:01.821 --> 01:28:02.480
<v Speaker 5>We were lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does that.</v>

1795
01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.150
<v Speaker 5>Is that real?</v>

1796
01:28:03.150 --> 01:28:05.370
<v Speaker 6>Is that legal ease?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1797
01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:08.970
<v Speaker 6>that doesn't work then that when you</v>
<v Speaker 6>call something a statue,</v>

1798
01:28:08.971 --> 01:28:12.510
<v Speaker 6>you could say that it's a prototype,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this is what we hope it looks like</v>

1799
01:28:12.511 --> 01:28:15.240
<v Speaker 6>in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but based on what like do you know what</v>

1800
01:28:15.241 --> 01:28:16.310
<v Speaker 6>the imaGes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you have a.</v>

1801
01:28:16.410 --> 01:28:18.430
<v Speaker 6>Can you pull it up?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was trying to remember who it was.</v>

1802
01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:22.800
<v Speaker 6>I want to say is it seems like if you</v>
<v Speaker 6>just call it a statue,</v>

1803
01:28:22.801 --> 01:28:27.390
<v Speaker 6>you could just totally bullshit people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't have to have any basis in</v>

1804
01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:32.010
<v Speaker 6>real engineering or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can just say it's a statue and he</v>

1805
01:28:32.011 --> 01:28:33.930
<v Speaker 6>could just have like a design concepts</v>
<v Speaker 6>to it.</v>

1806
01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:38.250
<v Speaker 6>Was it a concept as far as like a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 6>technological</v>

1807
01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:40.850
<v Speaker 5>vehicle with that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what they were trying to</v>

1808
01:28:40.851 --> 01:28:42.260
<v Speaker 5>show off the tech</v>

1809
01:28:42.570 --> 01:28:43.860
<v Speaker 6>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1810
01:28:45.330 --> 01:28:48.510
<v Speaker 6>Have you seen like what new cars are</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing now where all their dashboards are</v>

1811
01:28:48.511 --> 01:28:49.600
<v Speaker 6>all lcds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's</v>

1812
01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.550
<v Speaker 5>what I was trying to get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they were trying to show.</v>

1813
01:28:51.551 --> 01:28:54.540
<v Speaker 5>I think a little bit was like this is</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the new dashboard and everything's</v>

1814
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:56.410
<v Speaker 5>going to look like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go ahead and sit in there.</v>

1815
01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.420
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whenever one of the bmw,</v>

1816
01:28:58.421 --> 01:29:00.790
<v Speaker 5>I think it was an eight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had it inside the event.</v>

1817
01:29:00.791 --> 01:29:03.570
<v Speaker 5>There was long line for this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so 100 percent wasn't waiting,</v>

1818
01:29:03.571 --> 01:29:06.360
<v Speaker 5>but you put on the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was the microsoft surface</v>

1819
01:29:06.361 --> 01:29:08.490
<v Speaker 5>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I don't know why you would have this</v>

1820
01:29:08.491 --> 01:29:12.030
<v Speaker 5>on while you're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but maybe in the future we'll be doing</v>

1821
01:29:12.031 --> 01:29:15.840
<v Speaker 5>that and you're getting all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 5>extra information.</v>

1822
01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:17.720
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least my,</v>

1823
01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:19.610
<v Speaker 5>this is still just a prototype,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I don't know.</v>

1824
01:29:20.010 --> 01:29:22.440
<v Speaker 5>You weren't driving down the street so I</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't know what they're showing you.</v>

1825
01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:25.050
<v Speaker 5>They're just blasting stuff in your face</v>
<v Speaker 5>on what it might look like.</v>

1826
01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:28.600
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what you would be wanting</v>

1827
01:29:28.601 --> 01:29:29.800
<v Speaker 5>to see though also.</v>

1828
01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:32.530
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it just seems like whatever,</v>

1829
01:29:32.531 --> 01:29:35.380
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever possibilities they have now,</v>

1830
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:36.850
<v Speaker 6>it's you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1831
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:40.990
<v Speaker 6>you just try to extrapolate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You try to add up the steps between now</v>

1832
01:29:40.991 --> 01:29:45.400
<v Speaker 6>and fIve to 10 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be really weird.</v>

1833
01:29:45.490 --> 01:29:47.750
<v Speaker 6>Did you see the darpa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the darpa announcements that</v>

1834
01:29:47.751 --> 01:29:48.820
<v Speaker 6>we're talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 6>All the different.</v>

1835
01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.200
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't an announcement.</v>

1836
01:29:50.201 --> 01:29:53.170
<v Speaker 6>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was an interview they did with one of</v>

1837
01:29:53.171 --> 01:29:55.450
<v Speaker 6>the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tweeted it so you could find it on my</v>

1838
01:29:55.451 --> 01:30:00.050
<v Speaker 6>twitter timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're essentially saying the new,</v>

1839
01:30:00.130 --> 01:30:02.780
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>inventions over the next,</v>

1840
01:30:02.781 --> 01:30:04.420
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>12 months,</v>

1841
01:30:04.421 --> 01:30:08.200
<v Speaker 6>we're just going to blow people's minds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So apparently they're working on some</v>

1842
01:30:08.201 --> 01:30:11.860
<v Speaker 6>really heavy duty stuff when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 6>neural implants.</v>

1843
01:30:12.370 --> 01:30:14.560
<v Speaker 6>Things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he was mentioning</v>

1844
01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:21.850
<v Speaker 6>is darpa's biotech chief says 2017 will</v>
<v Speaker 6>blow our minds.</v>

1845
01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:26.380
<v Speaker 6>Air quotes</v>
<v Speaker 6>the pentagon,</v>

1846
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:28.850
<v Speaker 6>pentagon is research and development</v>
<v Speaker 6>division.</v>

1847
01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:33.050
<v Speaker 6>The creative force behind the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And gps retooled itself three years ago</v>

1848
01:30:33.051 --> 01:30:38.051
<v Speaker 6>to create a new office dedicated to</v>
<v Speaker 6>unraveling biology's engineering</v>

1849
01:30:38.061 --> 01:30:42.410
<v Speaker 6>secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The new biological technologies office</v>

1850
01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:47.510
<v Speaker 6>has a mission to harness the power of</v>
<v Speaker 6>biological systems and design new</v>

1851
01:30:47.511 --> 01:30:51.750
<v Speaker 6>defense technology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're gonna make terminators right</v>

1852
01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:56.090
<v Speaker 6>over the past year with a budget of</v>
<v Speaker 6>about $296 million dollars.</v>

1853
01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:59.990
<v Speaker 6>It has been exploring challenges</v>
<v Speaker 6>including memory improvement,</v>

1854
01:30:59.991 --> 01:31:04.991
<v Speaker 6>human machine symbiosis and speeding up</v>
<v Speaker 6>disease detection and response.</v>

1855
01:31:05.630 --> 01:31:07.370
<v Speaker 6>Fuck dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Listen to what that says.</v>

1856
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:12.390
<v Speaker 6>Human machine symbiosis there making up</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking terminator.</v>

1857
01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:15.970
<v Speaker 6>They're gunna make a terminator 100</v>
<v Speaker 6>percent.</v>

1858
01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:20.290
<v Speaker 6>If someone comes along and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>first pieces of artificial intelligence</v>

1859
01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:24.940
<v Speaker 6>is a soldier of machine soldier that</v>
<v Speaker 6>makes no mistakes,</v>

1860
01:31:24.941 --> 01:31:26.620
<v Speaker 6>feels no emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>does everything.</v>

1861
01:31:26.621 --> 01:31:31.621
<v Speaker 6>It's told consent back data in four k in</v>
<v Speaker 6>real time and you watch a screen through</v>

1862
01:31:33.101 --> 01:31:35.560
<v Speaker 6>its eyes and tell what to do and it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>invincible.</v>

1863
01:31:36.330 --> 01:31:38.940
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course they're going to build that.</v>

1864
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:42.690
<v Speaker 6>Why would we just send those to mars?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We would probably,</v>

1865
01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:45.330
<v Speaker 6>but people want to go to mars because</v>
<v Speaker 6>they want to be the first.</v>

1866
01:31:45.810 --> 01:31:49.710
<v Speaker 6>You know here we're doing yoga and</v>
<v Speaker 6>maurice were all amazing.</v>

1867
01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.930
<v Speaker 5>Like I saw a couple of those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a unit,</v>

1868
01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:56.620
<v Speaker 5>they're not brand new but like a robot</v>
<v Speaker 5>assistance essentially where it's like a</v>

1869
01:31:56.870 --> 01:32:01.180
<v Speaker 5>a laptop or an ipad screen that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>attached to a droid or a little robot</v>

1870
01:32:01.210 --> 01:32:04.450
<v Speaker 5>and there's someone on there talking to</v>
<v Speaker 5>answer your questions or whatever and</v>

1871
01:32:04.451 --> 01:32:05.980
<v Speaker 5>they can control it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Moving arounD the room.</v>

1872
01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.550
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen those?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1873
01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.150
<v Speaker 5>I've walked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kind of just walked by and I thought</v>

1874
01:32:10.151 --> 01:32:12.400
<v Speaker 5>it was funny because there was three of</v>
<v Speaker 5>them people were talking to and there's</v>

1875
01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:15.260
<v Speaker 5>just one guy no one was talking to and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just looked bored.</v>

1876
01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:18.970
<v Speaker 5>Like moving around like someone talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about someone talk to me.</v>

1877
01:32:20.490 --> 01:32:23.100
<v Speaker 6>What was the most impressive thing for</v>
<v Speaker 6>you at the event?</v>

1878
01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:24.490
<v Speaker 5>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Honestly,</v>

1879
01:32:24.491 --> 01:32:26.070
<v Speaker 5>that I'd have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was weird.</v>

1880
01:32:26.071 --> 01:32:27.810
<v Speaker 5>I probably just because I was looking</v>
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>

1881
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:30.190
<v Speaker 5>but that camera,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that three d stereoscopic camera,</v>

1882
01:32:30.670 --> 01:32:32.470
<v Speaker 5>three 60 camera,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but again,</v>

1883
01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:37.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure if what I was seeing was</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rendered video because that's</v>

1884
01:32:37.601 --> 01:32:40.240
<v Speaker 5>specifically what I kept asking to see</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I would walk up to one of these</v>

1885
01:32:40.241 --> 01:32:41.074
<v Speaker 5>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to.</v>

1886
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:42.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be pitched.</v>

1887
01:32:42.341 --> 01:32:44.470
<v Speaker 5>I just want to see what your rendered</v>
<v Speaker 5>video looks like.</v>

1888
01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:49.630
<v Speaker 5>What does the output.</v>
<v Speaker 5>MosT of what I was seeing wasn't great</v>

1889
01:32:49.690 --> 01:32:52.660
<v Speaker 5>or didn't look better than what's</v>
<v Speaker 5>currently on the market except for that.</v>

1890
01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:56.560
<v Speaker 5>And then a couple of didn't even do</v>
<v Speaker 5>audio or you couldn't mix audio into it.</v>

1891
01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:58.870
<v Speaker 5>And for our purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is I was looking for it to help</v>

1892
01:32:58.871 --> 01:33:01.900
<v Speaker 5>here in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to knock that out.</v>

1893
01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:04.930
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were a couple of car things.</v>

1894
01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:10.020
<v Speaker 5>Mostly just the bmw 7:50,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the coolest one.</v>

1895
01:33:10.241 --> 01:33:13.220
<v Speaker 5>They were showing those off there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're also doing test drives with like</v>

1896
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:15.940
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] and I think some of the self</v>
<v Speaker 5>driving cars maybe</v>

1897
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.360
<v Speaker 6>I think the sevenfifty drives itself to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's the big one that does,</v>

1898
01:33:19.361 --> 01:33:22.300
<v Speaker 6>but I believe it makes you put your hand</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the wheel,</v>

1899
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:26.820
<v Speaker 6>but it'll drive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is even freakier like imagines</v>

1900
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:29.710
<v Speaker 6>driving for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the idea is like if it fucks up,</v>

1901
01:33:29.711 --> 01:33:31.780
<v Speaker 6>but what am I doing then why does my</v>
<v Speaker 6>hands here?</v>

1902
01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:32.763
<v Speaker 6>I didn't see it.</v>

1903
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:35.240
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't take it on a test drive myself,</v>

1904
01:33:35.241 --> 01:33:38.360
<v Speaker 5>but they had one sitting out that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>could like get in and just kinda like</v>

1905
01:33:38.361 --> 01:33:41.270
<v Speaker 5>sit in and whatnot with all the extra</v>
<v Speaker 5>screens everywhere.</v>

1906
01:33:41.690 --> 01:33:43.610
<v Speaker 5>But the backseat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which probably is,</v>

1907
01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:45.140
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I probably just didn't know this.</v>

1908
01:33:45.170 --> 01:33:48.760
<v Speaker 5>It's basically like a first class luxury</v>
<v Speaker 5>seat like that.</v>

1909
01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:51.080
<v Speaker 5>You could lift your feet up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stick on the back of the seat.</v>

1910
01:33:51.081 --> 01:33:53.070
<v Speaker 5>There was a place for them to have</v>
<v Speaker 5>massage or.</v>

1911
01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:54.080
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was insane.</v>

1912
01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:56.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They give you a back rub or massage.</v>

1913
01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:01.370
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's a new hot</v>
<v Speaker 5>technology right now or if some</v>

1914
01:34:01.371 --> 01:34:05.570
<v Speaker 5>companies are very smart knowing people</v>
<v Speaker 5>are walking around this event tired and</v>

1915
01:34:05.571 --> 01:34:09.890
<v Speaker 5>need a massage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the lines for massage chairs at ces</v>

1916
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:10.783
<v Speaker 5>were insane.</v>

1917
01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:11.980
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>think about this jamie.</v>

1918
01:34:11.981 --> 01:34:13.850
<v Speaker 6>You run all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1919
01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.520
<v Speaker 6>I mean how many miles a week do you run?</v>

1920
01:34:15.630 --> 01:34:17.700
<v Speaker 5>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't been doing it very often,</v>

1921
01:34:17.701 --> 01:34:20.610
<v Speaker 5>but at my height probably 30,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but maybe 10,</v>

1922
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:23.350
<v Speaker 6>10 a week now what's going on with you</v>
<v Speaker 6>now?</v>

1923
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:25.400
<v Speaker 6>I just kinda weight training instead of</v>
<v Speaker 6>running.</v>

1924
01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:25.920
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

1925
01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.100
<v Speaker 6>yoked,</v>
<v Speaker 6>young.</v>

1926
01:34:27.101 --> 01:34:31.600
<v Speaker 6>Jamie getting swole.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My point is you're a very fit guy and</v>

1927
01:34:31.601 --> 01:34:35.170
<v Speaker 6>you exercise on a regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so for you to walk 25 miles,</v>

1928
01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:38.710
<v Speaker 6>if that's a strain for you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>imagine what it is for a bunch of these</v>

1929
01:34:38.711 --> 01:34:40.090
<v Speaker 6>fatties.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No fence,</v>

1930
01:34:40.150 --> 01:34:41.020
<v Speaker 6>no need to fat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shame.</v>

1931
01:34:41.650 --> 01:34:43.390
<v Speaker 6>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you are no big deal.</v>

1932
01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:45.060
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's,</v>

1933
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:50.080
<v Speaker 6>it's got to be really fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you are really poorly fed,</v>

1934
01:34:50.110 --> 01:34:53.140
<v Speaker 6>you know you're eating a bunch of shitty</v>
<v Speaker 6>food and you're out of shape and you're</v>

1935
01:34:53.141 --> 01:34:55.230
<v Speaker 6>overweight and you're walking around</v>
<v Speaker 6>ces,</v>

1936
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:57.250
<v Speaker 6>geeked out of your mind on caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1937
01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:58.880
<v Speaker 6>it's probably a good start for the new</v>
<v Speaker 6>year.</v>

1938
01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:01.790
<v Speaker 6>So you just keep that going.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Walk 10 miles a day.</v>

1939
01:35:01.791 --> 01:35:06.350
<v Speaker 6>Every day you'll.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That way it'll peel off you find a hill</v>

1940
01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:09.890
<v Speaker 6>unless you live in Iowa or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some flat spot.</v>

1941
01:35:10.110 --> 01:35:11.600
<v Speaker 6>Find a fucking hill.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Walk up hills.</v>

1942
01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:14.510
<v Speaker 6>It's hardest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just got one right in front of my house.</v>

1943
01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:16.610
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Two hundred yards up hill to take a</v>

1944
01:35:16.611 --> 01:35:18.530
<v Speaker 6>backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Throw some fucking sandbags in the</v>

1945
01:35:18.531 --> 01:35:21.560
<v Speaker 6>backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Walk up the hill and then get off the</v>

1946
01:35:21.561 --> 01:35:23.840
<v Speaker 6>trail,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like get off the trail and just walk up</v>

1947
01:35:23.841 --> 01:35:26.480
<v Speaker 6>the hill hill like walk up the grass and</v>
<v Speaker 6>the dirt.</v>

1948
01:35:26.481 --> 01:35:28.610
<v Speaker 6>So it slides and you have to correct</v>
<v Speaker 6>yourself.</v>

1949
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:30.260
<v Speaker 6>It's one of the best workouts you can</v>
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>

1950
01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:33.620
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was in pretty fucking good shape the</v>

1951
01:35:33.621 --> 01:35:36.180
<v Speaker 6>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everyone hiking with steve rinella when</v>

1952
01:35:36.181 --> 01:35:40.380
<v Speaker 6>we went hunting and just following him</v>
<v Speaker 6>walking up hills.</v>

1953
01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:42.630
<v Speaker 6>Did we die?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the second time it's happened.</v>

1954
01:35:43.230 --> 01:35:46.720
<v Speaker 6>It's the video still recording,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the stream is just Putting.</v>

1955
01:35:47.370 --> 01:35:49.320
<v Speaker 6>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think it'S um,</v>

1956
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:54.120
<v Speaker 6>the machine or is it the connection with</v>
<v Speaker 6>youtube we don't know.</v>

1957
01:35:54.930 --> 01:35:56.640
<v Speaker 6>Did you find,</v>
<v Speaker 6>speaking of which,</v>

1958
01:35:56.760 --> 01:36:01.670
<v Speaker 6>did you find any new a streaming</v>
<v Speaker 6>solutions because right now for people</v>

1959
01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:04.380
<v Speaker 6>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're using a tricaster setup and it's</v>

1960
01:36:04.381 --> 01:36:07.470
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really good for tHe most part,</v>

1961
01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:11.210
<v Speaker 6>but it has fucked us in the ass at least</v>
<v Speaker 6>three or four times.</v>

1962
01:36:11.250 --> 01:36:11.940
<v Speaker 6>Pretty hard</v>

1963
01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:14.340
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There wasn't a lot of stuff because it's</v>

1964
01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:16.920
<v Speaker 4>again that was the consumer show so</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not.</v>

1965
01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:21.090
<v Speaker 4>Consumers aren't really out here</v>
<v Speaker 4>streaming for four or five different</v>

1966
01:36:21.091 --> 01:36:24.030
<v Speaker 4>devices at once and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I did find a couple of things that</v>

1967
01:36:24.031 --> 01:36:29.010
<v Speaker 4>were close that I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were upgrades of stuff we used to</v>

1968
01:36:29.011 --> 01:36:29.844
<v Speaker 4>use</v>

1969
01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:32.590
<v Speaker 6>couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well If you think about how many</v>

1970
01:36:32.591 --> 01:36:34.330
<v Speaker 6>episodes we have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what are we on?</v>

1971
01:36:34.331 --> 01:36:37.300
<v Speaker 6>Like 880 episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ninety six.</v>

1972
01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:38.200
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There you go.</v>

1973
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:40.400
<v Speaker 6>Outside.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Plus a little slight tension.</v>

1974
01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:42.970
<v Speaker 6>Eight 96.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So think about that.</v>

1975
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.320
<v Speaker 6>Eight hundred 96 episodes and it's shit</v>
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>

1976
01:36:47.321 --> 01:36:49.720
<v Speaker 6>How many times a day</v>

1977
01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.670
<v Speaker 4>knocked down to that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>$400.</v>

1978
01:36:52.671 --> 01:36:55.480
<v Speaker 4>So on here and just brush it out four or</v>
<v Speaker 4>five times.</v>

1979
01:36:55.730 --> 01:36:57.680
<v Speaker 6>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One.</v>

1980
01:36:57.730 --> 01:36:59.390
<v Speaker 6>One percent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not good.</v>

1981
01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:02.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was not very good.</v>

1982
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:03.590
<v Speaker 6>It shouldn't at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's way.</v>

1983
01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:06.920
<v Speaker 6>That's way too often.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean maybe we're fucked up.</v>

1984
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:10.190
<v Speaker 6>Maybe we did something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe a.</v>

1985
01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:12.710
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe our machine just got a weird bug</v>

1986
01:37:12.711 --> 01:37:13.544
<v Speaker 6>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>YeaH,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean I reset it multiple times and I</v>

1988
01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:19.660
<v Speaker 4>have problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do the protocol of update.</v>

1989
01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:21.650
<v Speaker 6>Do you think it's just because it's long</v>
<v Speaker 6>term.</v>

1990
01:37:21.651 --> 01:37:24.680
<v Speaker 6>You were doing these for hours and hours</v>
<v Speaker 6>at a time and heats up.</v>

1991
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:27.700
<v Speaker 6>We do stressed the hell out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1992
01:37:27.710 --> 01:37:29.500
<v Speaker 6>If you think about like what we do and</v>
<v Speaker 6>company.</v>

1993
01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:32.930
<v Speaker 6>You know what my frIend justin I know</v>
<v Speaker 6>was doing the action report.</v>

1996
01:37:35.481 --> 01:37:36.340
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can,</v>

1997
01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:38.530
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think every time I think that I find</v>

1998
01:37:38.531 --> 01:37:39.910
<v Speaker 4>another comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1999
01:37:39.911 --> 01:37:42.760
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll do just about as long justin.</v>

2000
01:37:42.761 --> 01:37:44.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember having any problems</v>
<v Speaker 4>with his system.</v>

2001
01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:48.030
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we got a wHack system dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could have been when we went to</v>

2002
01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:49.840
<v Speaker 4>lemans happened with cars from time to</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2003
01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:53.680
<v Speaker 4>That could have just been some component</v>
<v Speaker 4>in here that was bad that we've gotten</v>

2004
01:37:53.681 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 4>around working with that now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just</v>

2005
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.650
<v Speaker 6>not gonna work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cars are another interesting thing.</v>

2006
01:37:58.651 --> 01:38:01.530
<v Speaker 6>Along the same lines when we were</v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about earlier about technology</v>

2007
01:38:01.531 --> 01:38:05.610

<v Speaker 6>ramp up the litter regular car that you</v>
<v Speaker 6>buy from a dealership is equivalent to</v>

2061
01:40:58.841 --> 01:41:03.220
<v Speaker 6>like one of the best cars ever just 10</v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago or 20 years ago.</v>

2062
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:07.570
<v Speaker 6>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the technology is so ahead of its time</v>

2063
01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:13.020
<v Speaker 6>that you go back to 97 and you look at</v>
<v Speaker 6>the cars that were like the top of the</v>

2064
01:41:13.181 --> 01:41:16.060
<v Speaker 6>food chain back in [inaudible] 97.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they didn't even compare.</v>

2065
01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:20.940
<v Speaker 6>There's just nothing like these things</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they're going to keep doing it.</v>

2066
01:41:21.090 --> 01:41:22.130
<v Speaker 6>The only thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you,</v>

2067
01:41:22.170 --> 01:41:27.170
<v Speaker 6>there was some cars from 97 that have</v>
<v Speaker 6>some attributes that people like,</v>

2068
01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:31.170
<v Speaker 6>like um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those old land cruisers.</v>

2069
01:41:31.290 --> 01:41:34.860
<v Speaker 6>If you bought a land cruiser from toyota</v>
<v Speaker 6>in [inaudible] 97,</v>

2070
01:41:35.010 --> 01:41:38.670
<v Speaker 6>you essentially got an off road vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had two solid axle,</v>

2071
01:41:38.671 --> 01:41:40.920
<v Speaker 6>solid front axle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>solid rear axle.</v>

2072
01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:45.210
<v Speaker 6>you could take those things and just</v>
<v Speaker 6>drive up the side of a fucking mountain</v>

2073
01:41:45.211 --> 01:41:47.880
<v Speaker 6>in it with the right tires.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were crazy beefy,</v>

2074
01:41:47.881 --> 01:41:50.700
<v Speaker 6>like right out of the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so people to this day,</v>

2075
01:41:50.701 --> 01:41:54.570
<v Speaker 6>they take those cars and they jack them</v>
<v Speaker 6>up and put bigger tires and wheels on</v>

2076
01:41:54.571 --> 01:41:58.470
<v Speaker 6>them and they put corvette engines in</v>
<v Speaker 6>them just because the configuration is</v>

2077
01:41:58.471 --> 01:42:02.220
<v Speaker 6>so durable,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they don't really make too many.</v>

2078
01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:06.150
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's only a few companies that</v>
<v Speaker 6>will make like a real car that you could</v>

2079
01:42:06.151 --> 01:42:09.270
<v Speaker 6>actually take right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just go dry like a jeep.</v>

2080
01:42:09.530 --> 01:42:12.240
<v Speaker 6>Jeeps are perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can take a jeep kind of like right</v>

2081
01:42:12.241 --> 01:42:17.241
<v Speaker 6>off the factory floor and drive to most</v>
<v Speaker 6>places that most cars can't get to or at</v>

2082
01:42:17.431 --> 01:42:19.920
<v Speaker 6>least drive to places that most cars</v>
<v Speaker 6>can't get it too.</v>

2083
01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.980
<v Speaker 6>But when you want to get further and</v>
<v Speaker 6>further into it,</v>

2084
01:42:23.250 --> 01:42:26.190
<v Speaker 6>they started doing all these crazy</v>
<v Speaker 6>modifications to these things and make</v>

2085
01:42:26.191 --> 01:42:29.250
<v Speaker 6>them so that they could literally just</v>
<v Speaker 6>drive through the woods.</v>

2086
01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:32.130
<v Speaker 2>What do you Look up their fellow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2087
01:42:32.970 --> 01:42:36.430
<v Speaker 2>I just remembered this bad ass supercar</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I saw at ces.</v>

2088
01:42:36.431 --> 01:42:39.160
<v Speaker 2>It was three d printed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh jesus.</v>

2089
01:42:39.370 --> 01:42:42.010
<v Speaker 2>It's called the divergent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the company that makes,</v>

2090
01:42:42.011 --> 01:42:44.200
<v Speaker 2>it's called divergent three d.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is called the blade.</v>

2091
01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you sit in the middle,</v>

2092
01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:48.110
<v Speaker 2>like a total bad ass?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2093
01:42:48.130 --> 01:42:50.410
<v Speaker 2>that needs to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the whole entire thing is three</v>

2094
01:42:50.411 --> 01:42:52.060
<v Speaker 2>d printing shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're down to the tires.</v>

2095
01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:57.660
<v Speaker 6>That is just such a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's like the alien from John</v>

2096
01:42:57.660 --> 01:42:58.493
<v Speaker 6>Carpenter movie.</v>

2097
01:42:59.070 --> 01:43:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Not John Carpenter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridley scott,</v>

2098
01:43:02.370 --> 01:43:06.870
<v Speaker 2>ridley scott's alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if he drove a car like it was</v>

2099
01:43:06.871 --> 01:43:09.130
<v Speaker 2>on his planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that thing one seat.</v>

2100
01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Someone would probably sit behind you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

2101
01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:15.540
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to find the spec to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how weird.</v>

2102
01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:19.860
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't sure to either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll fit like was it a car that can</v>

2103
01:43:19.861 --> 01:43:24.030
<v Speaker 2>drive if it's a or if they're just also</v>
<v Speaker 2>add concept of showing like look,</v>

2104
01:43:24.031 --> 01:43:29.031
<v Speaker 2>we can put these pieces out in three d</v>
<v Speaker 2>printing because I saw a three d metal</v>

2105
01:43:29.491 --> 01:43:31.590
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a company I was printing stuff and</v>

2106
01:43:31.591 --> 01:43:34.320
<v Speaker 2>metal</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like at work.</v>

2107
01:43:34.321 --> 01:43:35.154
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2108
01:43:36.450 --> 01:43:37.740
<v Speaker 6>these cars today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2109
01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:38.350
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2110
01:43:38.350 --> 01:43:42.180
<v Speaker 6>it's really interesting because they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>backed into this weird corner where how</v>

2111
01:43:42.181 --> 01:43:46.800
<v Speaker 6>much better can they keep getting and</v>
<v Speaker 6>how long before they're all automated</v>

2112
01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:49.410
<v Speaker 6>because it seems like just a matter of</v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

2113
01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 6>It seems like just a few years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're all gonna be automated.</v>

2114
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:53.750
<v Speaker 2>That's what everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what a lot of the companies were</v>

2115
01:43:53.751 --> 01:43:56.270
<v Speaker 2>showing off their automation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>LIke mercedes,</v>

2116
01:43:56.271 --> 01:43:59.460
<v Speaker 2>I think nissan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>toyota and video.</v>

2117
01:43:59.490 --> 01:44:02.910
<v Speaker 2>The video game card company was showing</v>
<v Speaker 2>off a.</v>

2118
01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:07.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their software I think.</v>

2119
01:44:07.461 --> 01:44:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Are there hardware that was being put</v>
<v Speaker 2>into cars to show you how things are</v>

2120
01:44:10.251 --> 01:44:12.410
<v Speaker 2>being read?</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is a car,</v>

2121
01:44:12.411 --> 01:44:13.940
<v Speaker 2>this is a light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a person.</v>

2122
01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Just like how it's being recognized and</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatnot.</v>

2123
01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:21.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mercedes was showing it and I think bmw</v>

2124
01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:24.950
<v Speaker 2>gotten to a car wreck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it was their</v>

2125
01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:28.270
<v Speaker 2>autonomous car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That car.</v>

2126
01:44:30.710 --> 01:44:33.080
<v Speaker 2>And then Fair day we're looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>camaro.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Zl one folks who are just listening or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2128

<v Speaker 2>there's images of it online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go look at it.</v>

2129
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Had the fair dave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's a fair day?</v>

01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Because didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2131
01:44:43.610 --> 01:44:46.490
<v Speaker 2>fisker have a new car too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They came back,</v>

2132
01:44:46.491 --> 01:44:48.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fisker karma.</v>

2133
01:44:48.141 --> 01:44:50.150
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know if they were showing</v>
<v Speaker 2>this at the event.</v>

2134
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:53.090
<v Speaker 2>So this is an electronic car with</v>
<v Speaker 2>electronic car.</v>

2135
01:44:53.091 --> 01:44:56.480
<v Speaker 2>That was being shown off there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a little issue with like their</v>

2136
01:44:56.481 --> 01:44:58.610
<v Speaker 2>reverse while they were doing their</v>
<v Speaker 2>demos,</v>

2137
01:44:58.611 --> 01:45:00.710
<v Speaker 2>so like again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the problems that doesn't always</v>

2138
01:45:00.711 --> 01:45:03.170
<v Speaker 2>that nothing goes perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they tried to announce this last</v>

2139
01:45:03.170 --> 01:45:08.170
<v Speaker 2>year and they had some bigger issues so</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ever seen an ad where the president</v>

2140
01:45:08.421 --> 01:45:10.730
<v Speaker 2>of the company stands right in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the volvo and it hits,</v>

2141
01:45:10.731 --> 01:45:11.540
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hits him,</v>

2142
01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:12.770
<v Speaker 2>sends him flying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2143
01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:16.130
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has technology to avoid contact</v>

2144
01:45:16.131 --> 01:45:18.440
<v Speaker 2>with humans and it just fucking runs him</v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

2145
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:22.670
<v Speaker 2>He went flying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy probably broke his hip on that.</v>

2146
01:45:23.630 --> 01:45:25.610
<v Speaker 2>It's happened a few times where they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to do things.</v>

2147
01:45:25.611 --> 01:45:28.250
<v Speaker 2>People will stand in front of it trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to show her husband was working for this</v>

2148
01:45:28.251 --> 01:45:29.084
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The doors went up.</v>

2162
01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:10.610
<v Speaker 2>We got to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The door shuts itself to.</v>

2163
01:46:10.670 --> 01:46:14.000
<v Speaker 2>How about you save fucking battery power</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let me shut the door.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What does that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to be like a spaceman</v>

2167
01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:31.430
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't look good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys had all this time to design</v>

2168
01:46:31.431 --> 01:46:33.680
<v Speaker 2>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He spent all this money and you made a</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking alexis mom car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that happened.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think that was one question.</v>

2171
01:46:39.621 --> 01:46:41.540
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when they do a car show the</v>

2172
01:46:41.541 --> 01:46:43.550
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say that they're going to do one</v>

2173
01:46:43.551 --> 01:46:45.620
<v Speaker 2>this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll show a car for 20 slash 20 and</v>

2174
01:46:45.621 --> 01:46:49.170
<v Speaker 2>it's going to look super high concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time it comes out it won't look</v>

2175
01:46:49.171 --> 01:46:50.004
<v Speaker 2>that way</v>

2176
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:53.130
<v Speaker 6>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes you're too well they,</v>

2177
01:46:53.131 --> 01:46:55.200
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they smoothed out edges and make things</v>

2178
01:46:55.201 --> 01:46:58.740
<v Speaker 6>cheaper to build and there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 6>cars that start out in concept form and</v>

2179
01:46:58.741 --> 01:47:02.400
<v Speaker 6>then when they get ultimately delivered,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're disappointing,</v>

2180
01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:05.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>come out with a bunch of different</v>

2181
01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:09.270
<v Speaker 6>things that they add to them that just</v>
<v Speaker 6>turned out to be too expensive.</v>

2182
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:12.000
<v Speaker 6>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're just try as the same kind of</v>

2183
01:47:12.001 --> 01:47:13.520
<v Speaker 6>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're just trying something or</v>

2184
01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:16.170
<v Speaker 6>Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The car company to like toyota,</v>

2185
01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:20.100
<v Speaker 6>like say if someone comes up with a new.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Toyota has thE most expensive car they</v>

2186
01:47:20.101 --> 01:47:23.790
<v Speaker 6>sell the land cruiser,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that big four wheel drive suv,</v>

2187
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.550
<v Speaker 6>that's their most expensive car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty expensive.</v>

2188
01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:28.110
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you get one,</v>

2189
01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:31.040
<v Speaker 6>they're all loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You only get them one way and they're</v>

2190
01:47:31.050 --> 01:47:36.050
<v Speaker 6>like 90 something like $90,000.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if you're building something that's</v>

2191
01:47:36.421 --> 01:47:41.421
<v Speaker 6>going to get more upscale than that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then it becomes a bit of an issue.</v>

2192
01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:43.860
<v Speaker 6>RighT.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Doesn't that make sense?</v>

2193
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:48.570
<v Speaker 6>I accidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was looking for toyota supercars as</v>

2194
01:47:48.571 --> 01:47:51.150
<v Speaker 6>this came up in the toyota.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Supra might be coming out again.</v>

2195
01:47:51.420 --> 01:47:52.253
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2196
01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:55.260
<v Speaker 6>that's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like will it look like this when it</v>

2197
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:56.370
<v Speaker 6>comes out?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're right.</v>

2198
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:58.530
<v Speaker 6>That's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a concept car.</v>

2199
01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:01.170
<v Speaker 6>I think it would probably look a lot</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that because that looks awesome.</v>

2200
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:03.510
<v Speaker 6>I mean if they wanted to make some</v>
<v Speaker 6>money,</v>

2201
01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:06.660
<v Speaker 6>but like then all those angles and all</v>
<v Speaker 6>that stuff.</v>

2202
01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:09.300
<v Speaker 6>Is it more expensive?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it less expensive?</v>

2203
01:48:09.370 --> 01:48:11.040
<v Speaker 6>What know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do we do about that wing?</v>

2204
01:48:11.041 --> 01:48:14.220
<v Speaker 6>Has it deploys it mechanical?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How much does that cost?</v>

2205
01:48:14.970 --> 01:48:16.930
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what kind of brakes are we using?</v>

2206
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:21.510
<v Speaker 6>Which kind of it it really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It gets into this weird area when it</v>

2207
01:48:21.511 --> 01:48:24.330
<v Speaker 6>comes to these cars,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they also have to be stunning in</v>

2208
01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:28.290
<v Speaker 6>terms of their ability because cars</v>
<v Speaker 6>today are off the charts.</v>

2209
01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:33.800
<v Speaker 6>WhaT you could buy from a subaru wrx.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just one of those little subarus that</v>

2210
01:48:34.291 --> 01:48:36.600
<v Speaker 6>has an insane little car,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2211
01:48:36.601 --> 01:48:38.400
<v Speaker 6>and I don't think those are very</v>
<v Speaker 6>expensive either.</v>

2212
01:48:38.401 --> 01:48:41.250
<v Speaker 6>I think that's in like mustang gt range,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2213
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:44.640
<v Speaker 6>Where it's like in the thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 6>32 to 35.</v>

2214
01:48:44.641 --> 01:48:47.250
<v Speaker 6>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure take that to 1970 and</v>

2215
01:48:47.251 --> 01:48:51.360
<v Speaker 6>you will destroy any car on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing comes close to it.</v>

2216
01:48:51.410 --> 01:48:53.460
<v Speaker 6>You would think you were from another</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking planet.</v>

2217
01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:56.310
<v Speaker 6>If he took that on a race car race car</v>
<v Speaker 6>track,</v>

2218
01:48:56.311 --> 01:48:57.840
<v Speaker 6>you'd be blowing people away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'd be like,</v>

2219
01:48:57.841 --> 01:49:02.610
<v Speaker 6>what in the fuck is it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just particular car companies are a lot</v>

2220
01:49:02.611 --> 01:49:05.580
<v Speaker 6>of the newer cars getting harder to fix</v>
<v Speaker 6>to where they have to be fixed at a</v>

2221
01:49:05.581 --> 01:49:08.280
<v Speaker 6>death by the dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They all have to be fixed by the dealer.</v>

2222
01:49:08.281 --> 01:49:11.280
<v Speaker 6>Everything is computer program now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They hAve minds,</v>

2223
01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:15.450
<v Speaker 6>you know the computer programmer or the</v>
<v Speaker 6>program rather than running the car runs</v>

2224
01:49:15.451 --> 01:49:16.770
<v Speaker 6>a traction control system.</v>

2225
01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:22.140
<v Speaker 6>The lane change system of accident</v>
<v Speaker 6>avoidance system.</v>

2226
01:49:22.141 --> 01:49:26.100
<v Speaker 6>Some of them hit the brakes for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some of them alarms go off when you get</v>

2227
01:49:26.101 --> 01:49:27.450
<v Speaker 6>close,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they've got sensors,</v>

2228
01:49:27.451 --> 01:49:31.790
<v Speaker 6>they got cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so getting your car fixed at a local by</v>

2229
01:49:31.791 --> 01:49:34.260
<v Speaker 6>a local guy somewhere and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 6>happening anymore.</v>

2230
01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:35.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's going to be phased out.</v>

2231
01:49:35.730 --> 01:49:38.100
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be all dealerships.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be like getting your</v>

2232
01:49:38.101 --> 01:49:39.810
<v Speaker 6>computer fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2233
01:49:39.811 --> 01:49:44.340
<v Speaker 6>it's really going to be like a super</v>
<v Speaker 6>high tech computer with rubber and metal</v>

2234
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:46.620
<v Speaker 6>and all this jazz that connects it to</v>
<v Speaker 6>the ground.</v>

2235
01:49:47.110 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 6>That mk</v>

2236
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:49.360
<v Speaker 2>market marquez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brownlee.</v>

2237
01:49:49.361 --> 01:49:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you say his name</v>

2238
01:49:50.681 --> 01:49:52.660
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mkbhd on youtube.</v>

2239
01:49:52.690 --> 01:49:54.280
<v Speaker 2>He got up at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do it.</v>

2240
01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Been here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2241
01:49:55.410 --> 01:49:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Mark has got a full lemon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his.</v>

2242
01:49:57.791 --> 01:50:01.720
<v Speaker 2>He had a tesla issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just got a new tesla and his drive</v>

2243
01:50:01.721 --> 01:50:06.430
<v Speaker 2>train was locking up fixed and then he</v>
<v Speaker 2>got it back and it got locked up again.</v>

2244
01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Wrong dude to fuck a shitty car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He should have tested that one first.</v>

2245
01:50:11.970 --> 01:50:13.420
<v Speaker 2>That will cost you some money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2246
01:50:13.710 --> 01:50:15.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of gives really good reviews</v>

2247
01:50:15.731 --> 01:50:17.140
<v Speaker 2>to his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2248
01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:19.960
<v Speaker 2>his online reviews of technology or one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my favorites him,</v>

2249
01:50:19.961 --> 01:50:22.720
<v Speaker 2>but him and louis from unbox therapy or</v>
<v Speaker 2>my.</v>

2250
01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:25.390
<v Speaker 2>There are two of mY favorites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man.</v>

2251
01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:27.130
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those things are not perfect,</v>

2252
01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:29.340
<v Speaker 6>but nothing electronic is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

2253
01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:31.450
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what are you going to do?</v>

2254
01:50:31.590 --> 01:50:34.570
<v Speaker 6>Somebody fucks up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Somebody put it together wrong or some</v>

2255
01:50:34.571 --> 01:50:36.300
<v Speaker 6>issues in the wiring.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who knows?</v>

2256
01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Part of why I'm not always super</v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced when someone goes full like</v>

2257
01:50:39.651 --> 01:50:41.570
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how it's going to be in the</v>

2258
01:50:41.571 --> 01:50:42.710
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because we still,</v>

2259
01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:45.770
<v Speaker 2>even today with all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coolest shit we have,</v>

2260
01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:50.210
<v Speaker 2>there are still major,</v>
<v Speaker 2>major problems that haven't been fixed</v>

2261
01:50:50.211 --> 01:50:53.390
<v Speaker 2>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see full fixes for them.</v>

2262
01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Like which ones do you think tesla?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if they're going to be fix</v>

2263
01:50:58.111 --> 01:50:59.840
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll fix it 100 percent.</v>

2264
01:51:00.010 --> 01:51:03.970
<v Speaker 6>Just stop and thinK about how clunky</v>
<v Speaker 6>computers were just a few years ago.</v>

2265
01:51:04.630 --> 01:51:08.050
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just when 1995 windows,</v>

2266
01:51:08.051 --> 01:51:10.570
<v Speaker 6>95 came along.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Think about how clunky the oPerating</v>

2267
01:51:10.571 --> 01:51:12.520
<v Speaker 6>system was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The blue screen of death,</v>

2268
01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:14.560
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean computers were crap,</v>

2269
01:51:14.561 --> 01:51:16.000
<v Speaker 6>but it still happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2270
01:51:16.090 --> 01:51:20.050
<v Speaker 6>But not nearly as much as it did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then think about how many computers</v>

2271
01:51:20.051 --> 01:51:22.360
<v Speaker 6>operate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many things all throughout your life</v>

2272
01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:26.260
<v Speaker 6>and how rarely they crash.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If they crashed one percent of the time,</v>

2273
01:51:26.261 --> 01:51:27.640
<v Speaker 6>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2274
01:51:27.641 --> 01:51:30.100
<v Speaker 6>the tricaster,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we get pissed,</v>

2275
01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:34.750
<v Speaker 6>which we're spoiled little babies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Back then when you had windows 95,</v>

2276
01:51:34.751 --> 01:51:38.500
<v Speaker 6>you had a backup things every 20 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 6>he can fucking kid crashed at any</v>

2277
01:51:38.501 --> 01:51:40.960
<v Speaker 6>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're sticking in floppy drives and</v>

2278
01:51:40.961 --> 01:51:42.920
<v Speaker 6>backing up files and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>True.</v>

2279
01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:45.010
<v Speaker 6>It's better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's better now.</v>

2280
01:51:45.011 --> 01:51:48.790
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be better soon and with</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever the issues that they have with</v>

2281
01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:51.460
<v Speaker 6>a tesla cars or maybe it's just one</v>
<v Speaker 6>tesla.</v>

2282
01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:56.470
<v Speaker 6>Just somebody fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe somebody just put a wire in that</v>

2283
01:51:56.471 --> 01:51:58.520
<v Speaker 6>had a scratch and who knows what the</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck?</v>

2284

<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

2287
01:52:01.370 --> 01:52:03.800

<v Speaker 6>Nothing goes wrong.</v>

2297
01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:31.560

<v Speaker 6>drive it.</v>

2298
01:52:31.650 --> 01:52:32.670
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it needs an oil.</v>

2299
01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:34.890

<v Speaker 6>They put the oil and they check</v>

<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>

2303
01:52:40.291 --> 01:52:42.840
<v Speaker 6>range rover.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's got one headlight on fucking smoke</v>

2304
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:44.820
<v Speaker 6>coming out of the hood.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what happened?</v>

2305
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:47.960
<v Speaker 6>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is the difference between a car</v>

2306
01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:52.961
<v Speaker 6>that's like a super reliable car company</v>
<v Speaker 6>like toyota and a car company.</v>

2307
01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:54.403
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2308
01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:57.560
<v Speaker 6>like if you get a maserati,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get a maserati because it's</v>

2309
01:52:57.561 --> 01:52:59.610
<v Speaker 6>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't get a maserati because you</v>

2310
01:52:59.611 --> 01:53:02.810
<v Speaker 6>plan on driving to the fucking moon and</v>
<v Speaker 6>he needed to stay together.</v>

2311
01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:06.240
<v Speaker 6>It's not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just not.</v>

2312
01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:09.730
<v Speaker 6>It sounds awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He started up blah blah blah blah blah</v>

2313
01:53:09.731 --> 01:53:12.050
<v Speaker 6>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if you get that car,</v>

2314
01:53:12.051 --> 01:53:14.600
<v Speaker 6>you get in it because it's sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not getting it because it.</v>

2315
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:16.250
<v Speaker 6>It's well designed.</v>

2316
01:53:17.730 --> 01:53:19.020
<v Speaker 5>OKay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2317
01:53:19.021 --> 01:53:22.590
<v Speaker 5>I guess I didn't know how I want</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything to be awesome.</v>

2318
01:53:22.750 --> 01:53:23.840
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I just.</v>

2319
01:53:23.950 --> 01:53:25.260
<v Speaker 5>It should have already happened</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes.</v>

2320
01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:28.230
<v Speaker 5>Like those kids in that lego movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything is awesome.</v>

2321
01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:34.820
<v Speaker 6>I didn't see it too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a cute movie.</v>

2322
01:53:34.980 --> 01:53:37.460
<v Speaker 6>I saw it with my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My kids love the lego movies,</v>

2323
01:53:37.490 --> 01:53:39.830
<v Speaker 6>but I enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I genuinely enjoyed it.</v>

2324
01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:40.880
<v Speaker 6>The lego movie was good.</v>

2325
01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:42.690
<v Speaker 5>I just saw a commercial for the newer</v>
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>

2326
01:53:42.691 --> 01:53:46.340
<v Speaker 5>I think it's got a batman not on all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>warning look for.</v>

2327
01:53:46.350 --> 01:53:47.183
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2328
01:53:47.380 --> 01:53:49.100
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're really well written.</v>

2329
01:53:49.130 --> 01:53:50.480
<v Speaker 6>They're fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2330
01:53:50.481 --> 01:53:53.360
<v Speaker 6>you gotta you can't be waiting for</v>
<v Speaker 6>things to be deep,</v>

2331
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:56.143
<v Speaker 6>deep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jamie.</v>

2332
01:53:56.480 --> 01:53:57.920
<v Speaker 6>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really tired of it.</v>

2333
01:53:57.950 --> 01:54:02.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm a less deep every year for real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I something that ron white said</v>

2334
01:54:03.771 --> 01:54:06.680
<v Speaker 6>when he was on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>key blind and stay drunk.</v>

2335
01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:09.500
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm paraphrasing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stay drug.</v>

2336
01:54:09.501 --> 01:54:14.501
<v Speaker 6>You keep lying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean in some ways the best way to</v>

2337
01:54:17.331 --> 01:54:21.350
<v Speaker 6>handle things just not go deep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The deeper you go.</v>

2338
01:54:21.351 --> 01:54:25.550
<v Speaker 6>Like I feel like we're clinging to</v>
<v Speaker 6>simplicity with the last of our</v>

2339
01:54:25.551 --> 01:54:27.710
<v Speaker 6>fingernails.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what I think and I think just</v>

2340
01:54:27.711 --> 01:54:30.490
<v Speaker 6>sitting on your fucking back porch,</v>
<v Speaker 6>smoking a cigar,</v>

2341
01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:33.680
<v Speaker 6>drinking a glass of lemonade.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's a thing of the past and</v>

2342
01:54:33.681 --> 01:54:38.681
<v Speaker 6>just a few decades I think we're going</v>
<v Speaker 6>to enter into some super bizarre world</v>

2343
01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:42.830
<v Speaker 6>that's like darpa is talking about</v>
<v Speaker 6>symbiosis.</v>

2344
01:54:42.831 --> 01:54:46.280
<v Speaker 6>Human computer symbiosis,</v>
<v Speaker 6>mean people complain.</v>

2345
01:54:46.281 --> 01:54:50.120
<v Speaker 6>Now the kids don't go outside their sit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sitting at home everyday playing x box.</v>

2346
01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:55.460
<v Speaker 6>Just imagine what it's going to be like</v>
<v Speaker 6>when we get to these really intense</v>

2347
01:54:55.490 --> 01:54:57.710
<v Speaker 6>augmented and virtual reality spaces.</v>

2348
01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:01.610
<v Speaker 5>Are you scared?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2349
01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:03.820
<v Speaker 5>I just stopped caring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think of that stuff about kids all the</v>

2350
01:55:03.821 --> 01:55:04.870
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have one side.</v>

2351
01:55:04.871 --> 01:55:05.860
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2352
01:55:05.861 --> 01:55:08.580
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't see the day to day their</v>

2353
01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:10.720
<v Speaker 5>interactions and how they're different</v>
<v Speaker 5>to mine,</v>

2354
01:55:10.721 --> 01:55:13.360
<v Speaker 5>but I just compare because my generation</v>
<v Speaker 5>or where I'm,</v>

2355
01:55:13.420 --> 01:55:15.070
<v Speaker 5>I just turned 34,</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I just,</v>

2356
01:55:15.071 --> 01:55:17.320
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I've just missed out on so</v>
<v Speaker 5>many things.</v>

2357
01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:21.100
<v Speaker 5>The year after I left high school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they all get a guy like tablet pcs for</v>

2358
01:55:21.101 --> 01:55:22.810
<v Speaker 5>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like literally the year after I</v>

2359
01:55:22.811 --> 01:55:25.210
<v Speaker 5>left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like you were tHe last.</v>

2360
01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:27.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's good talking about you.</v>

2361
01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:28.220
<v Speaker 5>Maybe</v>

2362
01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:29.270
<v Speaker 6>one day if you have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2363
01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:31.520
<v Speaker 6>My dad grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they didn't even have the tablet pcs in</v>

2364
01:55:31.521 --> 01:55:35.030
<v Speaker 6>the class the year after he got out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's when they came in.</v>

2365
01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:35.993
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

2366
01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:38.930
<v Speaker 5>But it wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how things would've been</v>

2367
01:55:38.931 --> 01:55:42.230
<v Speaker 5>different had we had them because</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever we know,</v>

2368
01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:43.920
<v Speaker 5>we always had a of people would look</v>
<v Speaker 5>back,</v>

2369
01:55:43.921 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 5>like</v>

2370
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:46.500
<v Speaker 4>if I could go back to high school now</v>
<v Speaker 4>with everything I know,</v>

2371
01:55:47.130 --> 01:55:48.550
<v Speaker 4>dominate and kill everything.</v>

2372
01:55:48.690 --> 01:55:51.220
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>You do it and you wouldn't be nervous.</v>

2373
01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:53.150
<v Speaker 6>That's why you would dominate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>True.</v>

2374
01:55:53.260 --> 01:55:55.170
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if some kid decided to kick your ass</v>

2375
01:55:55.171 --> 01:55:57.100
<v Speaker 6>and still kick your ass,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that would be disturbing.</v>

2376
01:55:57.230 --> 01:55:59.360
<v Speaker 4>But I didn't even mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like on the whole,</v>

2377
01:55:59.390 --> 01:56:01.910
<v Speaker 4>on the whole thing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going on specifically,</v>

2378
01:56:01.911 --> 01:56:03.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a technology,</v>

2379
01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:05.330
<v Speaker 4>a run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you had,</v>

2380
01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:10.070
<v Speaker 4>if I just took all my computer knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have now and had an ipad when I was in</v>

2381
01:56:10.071 --> 01:56:13.970
<v Speaker 4>high school and we could communicate</v>
<v Speaker 4>with everyone throughout the whole high</v>

2382
01:56:13.971 --> 01:56:18.971
<v Speaker 4>school all day anytime we wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like we had to write and we were</v>

2383
01:56:19.401 --> 01:56:20.840
<v Speaker 4>writing notes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still have,</v>

2384
01:56:20.841 --> 01:56:24.890
<v Speaker 4>I found a note from a girl in high</v>
<v Speaker 4>school like not too long ago in a box.</v>

2385
01:56:25.090 --> 01:56:26.270
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a literal note.</v>

2386
01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:27.500
<v Speaker 4>Dear jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2387
01:56:27.590 --> 01:56:28.281
<v Speaker 4>Dumb shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2388
01:56:28.281 --> 01:56:33.281
<v Speaker 4>I missed your touch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stupid questions of like what's so check</v>

2389
01:56:34.090 --> 01:56:38.210
<v Speaker 4>here</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that they might write notes still</v>

2390
01:56:38.211 --> 01:56:39.500
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might still be a thing.</v>

2391
01:56:39.501 --> 01:56:41.040
<v Speaker 4>it probably is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be that,</v>

2392
01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:45.440
<v Speaker 4>but like the purpose of it isn't there</v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

2393
01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:48.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's way more text messages to notes.</v>

2394
01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:49.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is.</v>

2395
01:56:49.390 --> 01:56:52.460
<v Speaker 4>And then a facetiming people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We couldn't.</v>

2396
01:56:52.670 --> 01:56:56.120
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't even a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had to literally falling into call.</v>

2397
01:56:56.121 --> 01:56:56.954
<v Speaker 4>Like if I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

2398
01:56:57.250 --> 01:56:59.690
<v Speaker 4>if I was in school with your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be calling your house,</v>

2399
01:56:59.691 --> 01:57:01.200
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey is so and so home.</v>

2400
01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:04.640
<v Speaker 4>Can I talk to them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd go get them and then we get to</v>

2401
01:57:04.641 --> 01:57:06.840
<v Speaker 4>talk for 20 or 30 minutes maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2402
01:57:06.860 --> 01:57:11.690
<v Speaker 4>When was the fIrst year we're skype came</v>
<v Speaker 4>out and people started skyping probably</v>

2403
01:57:11.691 --> 01:57:15.230
<v Speaker 4>within the last 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was an ease.</v>

2404
01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:17.150
<v Speaker 4>There was light video communication back</v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

2405
01:57:17.151 --> 01:57:18.350
<v Speaker 4>but it was terrible.</v>

2406
01:57:18.450 --> 01:57:21.180
<v Speaker 6>Well if that's one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 6>apple has nailed,</v>

2407
01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:26.130
<v Speaker 6>having facetime and its operating system</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you just automatic it automatically</v>

2408
01:57:26.131 --> 01:57:27.380
<v Speaker 6>works,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2409
01:57:27.410 --> 01:57:29.460
<v Speaker 6>you don't have to download anything,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to go get skype.</v>

2410
01:57:29.461 --> 01:57:32.100
<v Speaker 6>like if you have an android phone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you have to download skype or does it</v>

2411
01:57:32.101 --> 01:57:32.940
<v Speaker 6>come with your phone?</v>

2412
01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:35.310
<v Speaker 4>I</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know,</v>

2413
01:57:35.311 --> 01:57:37.260
<v Speaker 4>but I think that they have a thing to.</v>

2414
01:57:37.790 --> 01:57:39.850
<v Speaker 6>They have an androId thing to that just</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it.</v>

2415
01:57:39.930 --> 01:57:42.480
<v Speaker 6>But what's fucked up is it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>communicate with the apple thing.</v>

2416
01:57:42.481 --> 01:57:44.610
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you have to get in like everybody's</v>

2417
01:57:44.611 --> 01:57:45.610
<v Speaker 6>got to come to.</v>

2418
01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:48.090
<v Speaker 4>Well there's new apps too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can do it through,</v>

2419
01:57:48.210 --> 01:57:51.060
<v Speaker 4>you could do it through facebook now if</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a new one that's blowing up</v>

2420
01:57:51.061 --> 01:57:53.760
<v Speaker 4>right now called house party,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you can have like eight people on</v>

2421
01:57:54.230 --> 01:57:56.730
<v Speaker 4>and everyone can be having a video chat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2422
01:57:56.950 --> 01:57:58.510
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>buT that's an app that you have to</v>

2423
01:57:58.511 --> 01:58:01.150
<v Speaker 6>download.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like should be just like a phone call</v>

2424
01:58:01.151 --> 01:58:03.730
<v Speaker 6>should be like phone to phone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It should be phone to phone,</v>

2425
01:58:03.731 --> 01:58:07.210
<v Speaker 6>coMmunication with android to apple.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seems silly to me that they go</v>

2426
01:58:07.211 --> 01:58:10.060
<v Speaker 6>proprietary on that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Apple's got a bunch of really sneaky</v>

2427
01:58:10.061 --> 01:58:11.190
<v Speaker 6>ways to keep you around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>

2428
01:58:11.630 --> 01:58:14.650
<v Speaker 6>That I message is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Facetime is another.</v>

2429
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:16.330
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2430
01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:18.190
<v Speaker 6>what is it when they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2431
01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:20.680
<v Speaker 6>airdrops airdrops another one for</v>
<v Speaker 6>images?</v>

2432
01:58:20.710 --> 01:58:23.350
<v Speaker 6>No compression sends it through</v>
<v Speaker 6>bluetooth,</v>

2433
01:58:23.710 --> 01:58:26.890
<v Speaker 6>so amazing for videos and pictures and</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff.</v>

2434
01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:29.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say it's a problem isn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right word,</v>

2435
01:58:29.921 --> 01:58:34.921
<v Speaker 4>but that they are like the only record</v>
<v Speaker 4>label basically write or record</v>

2436
01:58:35.021 --> 01:58:39.460
<v Speaker 4>distribution play state control of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's kinda crazy to.</v>

2437
01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 4>It is well interesting too that</v>

2438
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.020
<v Speaker 2>a lot of musicians complain about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2439
01:58:44.021 --> 01:58:47.140
<v Speaker 2>apple is the biggest music company in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world now.</v>

2440
01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:50.260
<v Speaker 2>So strain of every transaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they really are?</v>

2441
01:58:50.261 --> 01:58:53.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they when</v>

2442
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:58.990
<v Speaker 2>they definitely want everyone to answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an answer and it's like,</v>

2443
01:58:58.991 --> 01:59:01.000
<v Speaker 2>well now you're not necessarily happy</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the answer,</v>

2444
01:59:01.001 --> 01:59:02.350
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got one.</v>

2445
01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:07.560
<v Speaker 2>It's A very weird company in that regard</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's also like the loyalest</v>

2446
01:59:08.410 --> 01:59:12.640
<v Speaker 2>apple loyalists are so extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people who worship at the cult of</v>

2447
01:59:12.641 --> 01:59:15.580
<v Speaker 2>mac and apple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I had a conversation with.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was really sad.</v>

2450
01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:22.273
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2496
02:01:20.531 --> 02:01:23.700
<v Speaker 2>healthy and being in vegas isn't the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best place to think about that too.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the worst for your soul to your</v>

02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:31.120
<v Speaker 2>soul's tugged at the gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what they'll do there is</v>

2499
02:01:31.121 --> 02:01:33.820
<v Speaker 2>because smoking is smoking weed path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2500
02:01:34.090 --> 02:01:36.730
<v Speaker 2>So how do you think they might handle</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're in the Future?</v>

2501
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have to handle the</v>

2502
02:01:37.961 --> 02:01:40.190
<v Speaker 2>extreme paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of stoners going</v>

2503
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:40.821
<v Speaker 6>in there like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2506
02:01:46.101 --> 02:01:48.770
<v Speaker 6>I think if I was running a casino,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would try to figure out a way to</v>

2507
02:01:48.771 --> 02:01:52.850
<v Speaker 6>capitalize on the stoners.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Big money that they make apparently</v>

2508
02:01:52.851 --> 02:01:57.620
<v Speaker 6>is those fucking huge disco places like</v>
<v Speaker 6>haka song where they get those dj's to</v>

2509
02:01:57.621 --> 02:01:58.454

2512
02:02:05.170 --> 02:02:07.040
<v Speaker 6>Because russell,</v>

2543
02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:28.490
<v Speaker 6>It's sort of an unspoken thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but those hock hassan places,</v>

2544
02:03:28.491 --> 02:03:31.670
<v Speaker 6>all those places,</v>

2552
02:03:47.950 --> 02:03:51.170
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 percent is being very reasonable to</v>

2553
02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:54.280
<v Speaker 2>go with at least 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like that's even low.</v>

2554
02:03:54.770 --> 02:03:58.040

2571
02:04:43.050 --> 02:04:45.780

<v Speaker 6>We all have like accidentally there</v>
<v Speaker 6>cherry drops on you and you're like,</v>

2629
02:07:15.581 --> 02:07:17.410
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And like your hands on fire.</v>

2630
02:07:17.411 --> 02:07:19.870
<v Speaker 6>You don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's because some drunk is hovering over</v>

2631
02:07:19.871 --> 02:07:22.120
<v Speaker 6>you with their cigarette while they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>talking and it just drops on you.</v>

2632
02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:26.260
<v Speaker 6>That happens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's a minor thing.</v>

2633
02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:29.080
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>anytime you get a giant group of people</v>

2634
02:07:29.081 --> 02:07:31.000
<v Speaker 6>together like that though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you run risks,</v>

2635
02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:33.520
<v Speaker 6>if they could give away pot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>see</v>

2636
02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:37.590
<v Speaker 6>the problem with selling it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even if you're selling it as you're</v>

2637
02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:40.060
<v Speaker 6>going to be responsible for all these</v>
<v Speaker 6>people having heart attacks,</v>

2638
02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:43.720
<v Speaker 6>if you give them edibles,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like give them that goddamn spray that</v>

2639
02:07:43.721 --> 02:07:45.970
<v Speaker 6>joey diaz just pumps it his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it's nothing.</v>

2640
02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:49.660
<v Speaker 6>This stuff is so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so powerful.</v>

2641
02:07:50.050 --> 02:07:51.650
<v Speaker 6>Like it's psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very,</v>

2642
02:07:51.651 --> 02:07:53.950
<v Speaker 6>it's very much like acid in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 6>ways.</v>

2643
02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:56.050
<v Speaker 6>When you get a high dose of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2644
02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:56.740
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2645
02:07:56.740 --> 02:08:00.880
<v Speaker 6>the sprays.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so if you were doing this experience</v>

2646
02:08:00.881 --> 02:08:02.980
<v Speaker 6>on that mean if you could keep it</v>
<v Speaker 6>together,</v>

2647
02:08:02.981 --> 02:08:05.530
<v Speaker 6>it'd be wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But a lot of people are going to get</v>

2648
02:08:05.531 --> 02:08:08.530
<v Speaker 6>super paranoid and freak out and have</v>
<v Speaker 6>panic attacks.</v>

2649
02:08:08.530 --> 02:08:10.900
<v Speaker 6>And so you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna want to sell them edibles.</v>

2650
02:08:10.901 --> 02:08:13.270
<v Speaker 6>It's like it's too strong for most</v>
<v Speaker 6>folks,</v>

2651
02:08:14.890 --> 02:08:16.690
<v Speaker 6>especially people that don't regularly</v>
<v Speaker 6>dabble in it.</v>

2652
02:08:16.691 --> 02:08:19.330
<v Speaker 6>They won't know how much to take.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not like booze.</v>

2653
02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:21.850
<v Speaker 6>Like if someone gives you a shot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you take a shy,</v>

2654
02:08:21.851 --> 02:08:24.520
<v Speaker 6>like holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you feel it pretty quick,</v>

2655
02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:26.650
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Someone gives you a couple shots.</v>

2656
02:08:26.651 --> 02:08:27.191
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh geez,</v>

2657
02:08:27.191 --> 02:08:28.420
<v Speaker 6>I gotta stop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've got to settle down.</v>

2658
02:08:28.750 --> 02:08:32.830
<v Speaker 6>Or you go crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know what a shot does like a</v>

2659
02:08:32.831 --> 02:08:34.750
<v Speaker 6>couple of sprays.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This who the fuck knows what's going to</v>

2660
02:08:34.751 --> 02:08:36.280
<v Speaker 6>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't know.</v>

2661
02:08:36.670 --> 02:08:37.810
<v Speaker 6>You're taking a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

2662
02:08:37.811 --> 02:08:39.070
<v Speaker 6>eat this cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2663
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:43.480
<v Speaker 6>You don't know you're taking a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A cookie might be like a shot or it</v>

2664
02:08:43.481 --> 02:08:46.630
<v Speaker 6>might be like a whole bottle of vodka,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2665
02:08:46.631 --> 02:08:50.260
<v Speaker 6>It might be so much of a hit a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're paralyzed and you just want to</v>

2666
02:08:50.261 --> 02:08:52.720
<v Speaker 6>lay in a fetal position on the ground.</v>

2667
02:08:53.890 --> 02:08:55.740
<v Speaker 6>So anytime you get a giant group of</v>
<v Speaker 6>people like this,</v>

2668
02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:58.300
<v Speaker 6>alcohol is like the safest bet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're going to sell it to them.</v>

2669
02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:02.590
<v Speaker 6>Everybody has how to deal with alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where they deal with it poorly or not.</v>

2670
02:09:03.130 --> 02:09:05.020
<v Speaker 6>You kind of know the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2671
02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:06.340
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had five beers.</v>

2672
02:09:06.341 --> 02:09:08.350
<v Speaker 6>Do don't drive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're fucked up.</v>

2673
02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:09.220
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2674
02:09:09.221 --> 02:09:11.380
<v Speaker 6>I had one shot while you're a 350</v>
<v Speaker 6>pounds,</v>

2675
02:09:11.381 --> 02:09:12.700
<v Speaker 6>you probably barely feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

2676
02:09:13.090 --> 02:09:15.670
<v Speaker 6>Like we all know what the tolerances</v>
<v Speaker 6>are.</v>

2677
02:09:15.671 --> 02:09:18.250
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty universally acknowledged.</v>

2678
02:09:19.230 --> 02:09:21.070
<v Speaker 6>I'd love that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A place like this exists though,</v>

2679
02:09:21.071 --> 02:09:23.110
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that these kids can get together and</v>

2680
02:09:23.111 --> 02:09:26.650
<v Speaker 6>just go fucking bananas because you can</v>
<v Speaker 6>make some life decisions in these kinds</v>

2681
02:09:26.651 --> 02:09:29.140
<v Speaker 6>of rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could decide where you're gonna,</v>

2682
02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:31.330
<v Speaker 6>how you're gonna live your life for</v>
<v Speaker 6>real,</v>

2683
02:09:31.630 --> 02:09:35.290
<v Speaker 6>because if you work everyday like Joe</v>
<v Speaker 6>Smith on that fucking construction site</v>

2684
02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:40.620
<v Speaker 6>and you show up even with your gold wbc</v>
<v Speaker 6>belt and everyday is hammering nails and</v>

2685
02:09:40.661 --> 02:09:43.480
<v Speaker 6>picking up wood and thinking of the time</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have off.</v>

2686
02:09:44.530 --> 02:09:49.530
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes you can go to a place like</v>
<v Speaker 6>this and you just experienced joy and</v>

2687
02:09:49.721 --> 02:09:54.721
<v Speaker 6>laughter and fun and partying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you start to think about your job</v>

2688
02:09:55.931 --> 02:09:57.460
<v Speaker 6>job,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your real job,</v>

2689
02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:00.640
<v Speaker 6>and you start to dread it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You start to really dread It.</v>

2690
02:10:00.670 --> 02:10:03.640
<v Speaker 6>You start to really get sick and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>start to think about all these people</v>

2691
02:10:03.641 --> 02:10:05.380
<v Speaker 6>that are putting on these electronic</v>
<v Speaker 6>carnivals.</v>

2692
02:10:05.381 --> 02:10:07.900
<v Speaker 6>Why can't I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or you think about something else you</v>

2693
02:10:07.901 --> 02:10:10.090
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got to make a living making furniture.</v>

2694
02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:13.510
<v Speaker 6>I love making furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I fucking loved designing it.</v>

2695
02:10:13.540 --> 02:10:16.390
<v Speaker 6>I've got to figure out a way to open up</v>
<v Speaker 6>a shop and then maybe something like</v>

2696
02:10:16.391 --> 02:10:17.500
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's these,</v>

2697
02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:21.670
<v Speaker 6>these moments when you're away from the</v>
<v Speaker 6>grind and you're just in this fantasy</v>

2698
02:10:21.671 --> 02:10:26.671
<v Speaker 6>land and you hear it</v>
<v Speaker 6>and everyone's on ecstasy and people are</v>

2699
02:10:28.061 --> 02:10:32.290
<v Speaker 6>walking by touching everybody's chest</v>
<v Speaker 6>and everybody's laughing and you just</v>

2700
02:10:32.291 --> 02:10:34.730
<v Speaker 6>realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is A.</v>

2701
02:10:34.730 --> 02:10:35.690
<v Speaker 6>This is all temporary.</v>

2702
02:10:35.690 --> 02:10:39.710
<v Speaker 6>This whole experience is temporary and</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm wasting so much of my temporary time</v>

2703
02:10:39.711 --> 02:10:44.270
<v Speaker 6>doing bullshit that I don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody tells you what law I want you</v>

2704
02:10:44.271 --> 02:10:46.070
<v Speaker 6>to take over the faMily plumbing</v>
<v Speaker 6>business.</v>

2705
02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:49.100
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to plumb.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to clean out anybody's</v>

2706
02:10:49.101 --> 02:10:54.070
<v Speaker 6>broken shitter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to make those led lights that,</v>

2707

<v Speaker 6>that turned into floatinG mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to make those.</v>

2708
02:10:57.051 --> 02:10:59.030
<v Speaker 6>Somebody has to make that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a job.</v>

2709
02:10:59.270 --> 02:11:00.650
<v Speaker 6>I have to figure out how to get that</v>
<v Speaker 6>job.</v>

2710
02:11:00.651 --> 02:11:04.130
<v Speaker 6>That would be the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2711
02:11:04.190 --> 02:11:06.930
<v Speaker 6>all these people that we have to rely on</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we keep the,</v>

2712
02:11:06.931 --> 02:11:08.750
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go to ces every year.</v>

2713
02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:10.400
<v Speaker 6>All those people that you have to rely</v>
<v Speaker 6>on,</v>

2714
02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:13.700
<v Speaker 6>like all those people pretty much had to</v>
<v Speaker 6>take a chance.</v>

2715
02:11:13.820 --> 02:11:16.850
<v Speaker 6>All oF them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pretty much everybody that's doing any</v>

2716
02:11:16.851 --> 02:11:19.910
<v Speaker 6>of those things where they're putting</v>
<v Speaker 6>out these new technologies and showing</v>

2717
02:11:19.911 --> 02:11:22.450
<v Speaker 6>all this new inventions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all of them had to be like</v>

2718
02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:26.360
<v Speaker 6>disenfranchise or disenchanted with</v>
<v Speaker 6>something and just got to take a chance.</v>

2719
02:11:26.570 --> 02:11:28.760
<v Speaker 6>This is what I want to do and then this</v>
<v Speaker 6>is what I'm going to pursue.</v>

2720
02:11:32.010 --> 02:11:34.260
<v Speaker 4>What else did you find that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything else?</v>

02:11:36.590 --> 02:11:38.880
<v Speaker 4>Because we've got to wrap this up soon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that was honestly,</v>

2722
02:11:38.881 --> 02:11:41.790
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see tons of stuff that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>blowing my mind this year.</v>

2723
02:11:41.850 --> 02:11:44.040
<v Speaker 4>I saw a couple of cool things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the phone?</v>

2724
02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:45.891

2740
02:12:25.831 --> 02:12:28.230
<v Speaker 4>trying to see what it was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was trying to figure out if it's</v>

2741
02:12:28.231 --> 02:12:30.720
<v Speaker 4>actually doing lens blur,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what a lot of people were</v>

2742
02:12:30.721 --> 02:12:33.900
<v Speaker 4>always after when they're taking</v>
<v Speaker 4>pictures they want really good blur,</v>

2743
02:12:34.710 --> 02:12:36.660
<v Speaker 4>photo look good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is what that portrait mode and the</v>

2744
02:12:36.661 --> 02:12:37.890
<v Speaker 4>new iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of all about.</v>

2745
02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:42.270
<v Speaker 4>So it keeps the foreground in focus in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the background becomes blurry,</v>

2746
02:12:42.271 --> 02:12:44.940
<v Speaker 4>like a real camera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was just asking if it was actually</v>

2747
02:12:44.941 --> 02:12:48.750
<v Speaker 4>doing it or if it was simulating it</v>
<v Speaker 4>using software and what he say.</v>

2748
02:12:49.530 --> 02:12:52.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure he was telling me that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was stimulating using software.</v>

2749
02:12:52.141 --> 02:12:54.780
<v Speaker 4>That's why he was hitting that button.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I kept putting my hand in</v>

2750
02:12:54.781 --> 02:12:56.550
<v Speaker 4>front of it to kind of see what was</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on.</v>

2751
02:12:56.670 --> 02:12:59.490
<v Speaker 6>So the cool thing about the iphone is it</v>
<v Speaker 6>uses hardware doing that,</v>

2752
02:12:59.491 --> 02:13:00.324
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2753
02:13:00.550 --> 02:13:01.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2754
02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:04.150
<v Speaker 4>it's using the toolkit as far as I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then again it could be doing some</v>

2755
02:13:04.151 --> 02:13:06.670
<v Speaker 4>other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same as me grabbing my dslr</v>

2756
02:13:06.671 --> 02:13:09.990
<v Speaker 4>camera and having a really good lens and</v>
<v Speaker 4>frame the focus point and all that.</v>

2757
02:13:10.330 --> 02:13:11.650
<v Speaker 4>It's not the exact same as that.</v>

2758
02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:13.850
<v Speaker 6>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you did That with a camera,</v>

2759
02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:16.070
<v Speaker 6>you'd be able to tell the difference in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the quality of the image.</v>

2760
02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:17.360
<v Speaker 4>That's sorta what I was going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2761
02:13:17.361 --> 02:13:20.780
<v Speaker 4>I kind of should be able to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like just by looking at it,</v>

2762
02:13:20.781 --> 02:13:22.910
<v Speaker 4>if it's real or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it didn't look real to me.</v>

2763
02:13:22.970 --> 02:13:24.800
<v Speaker 4>It could've just been a trick and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>might not have been.</v>

2764
02:13:25.590 --> 02:13:27.240
<v Speaker 4>I might've just been looking at</v>
<v Speaker 4>something I didn't,</v>

2765
02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:29.430
<v Speaker 4>I think I was seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

2766
02:13:29.670 --> 02:13:31.820
<v Speaker 4>what are these kids playing here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's three d games?</v>

2767
02:13:32.110 --> 02:13:34.170
<v Speaker 5>East sports.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is the intel booth.</v>

2768
02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:39.200
<v Speaker 5>They're doing a little bit of a there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what an ea sports game situation</v>

2769
02:13:40.021 --> 02:13:42.240
<v Speaker 5>might look like in the future because</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is going,</v>

2770
02:13:42.450 --> 02:13:45.530
<v Speaker 5>there's a tbs is broadcasting a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>east sports or some other company's</v>

2771
02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:46.410
<v Speaker 5>investing a lot in it.</v>

2772
02:13:46.770 --> 02:13:50.100
<v Speaker 2>How come they don't play those games on</v>
<v Speaker 2>ergonomic chairs like these,</v>

2773
02:13:50.490 --> 02:13:52.560
<v Speaker 2>these are ergo depot chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He desert,</v>

2774
02:13:52.710 --> 02:13:56.180
<v Speaker 2>those are ergonomic sort of like race</v>
<v Speaker 2>car chairs,</v>

2775
02:13:56.890 --> 02:13:59.770
<v Speaker 2>but racecar chairs you sit back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See when you play a game,</v>

2776
02:13:59.771 --> 02:14:02.080
<v Speaker 2>you lean forward just like you use a</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>

2777
02:14:02.090 --> 02:14:03.230
<v Speaker 5>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people do,</v>

2778
02:14:03.231 --> 02:14:06.270
<v Speaker 5>most people obviously are leaning for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they also have extra pads and um,</v>

2779
02:14:06.420 --> 02:14:09.560
<v Speaker 5>so like have your back in certain spots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what,</v>

2780
02:14:09.590 --> 02:14:12.200
<v Speaker 5>what's going on here as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the screen above them,</v>

2781
02:14:12.950 --> 02:14:15.890
<v Speaker 5>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their gameplay is being rendered above</v>

2782
02:14:15.891 --> 02:14:18.440
<v Speaker 5>their head so that you can be viewing</v>
<v Speaker 5>this in three d space.</v>

2783
02:14:18.441 --> 02:14:23.180
<v Speaker 5>So if you had a vr headset onto,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll be viewing these situations all</v>

2784
02:14:23.181 --> 02:14:25.640
<v Speaker 5>differently in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of just flows like a concept.</v>

2785
02:14:25.641 --> 02:14:26.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure they were showing.</v>

2786
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:28.840
<v Speaker 2>Do these chairs we use are so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at other.</v>

2787
02:14:28.890 --> 02:14:30.350
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's sitting in other chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2788
02:14:30.351 --> 02:14:35.351
<v Speaker 2>you poor bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These ergonomic capisce co chairs.</v>

2789
02:14:36.910 --> 02:14:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do those have haptic feedback or sound</v>

2790
02:14:40.281 --> 02:14:43.250
<v Speaker 2>to come out of them that know those</v>
<v Speaker 2>chairs don't really or anything.</v>

2791
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:44.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm still doing that window thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

2792
02:14:44.870 --> 02:14:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Where they have the window in the side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the computer.</v>

2793
02:14:46.401 --> 02:14:48.470
<v Speaker 2>We look in that one I was trying to show</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

2794
02:14:48.471 --> 02:14:51.130
<v Speaker 2>It has some e ink display going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you can't.</v>

2795
02:14:51.140 --> 02:14:53.450
<v Speaker 2>You could see it moving a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh whoa.</v>

2796
02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:54.313
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's dope.</v>

2797
02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:56.450
<v Speaker 2>So it just looks cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2798
02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:58.010
<v Speaker 2>it just looks cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2799
02:14:58.011 --> 02:15:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Well they've by having all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>different companies making pcs,</v>

2800
02:15:01.581 --> 02:15:03.840
<v Speaker 2>they opened themselves up to so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird innovations.</v>

2801
02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.460
<v Speaker 5>One real cool thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and again this is one of those things,</v>

2802
02:15:06.461 --> 02:15:11.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure if this is real or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is called a tiny most camera.</v>

2803
02:15:11.650 --> 02:15:14.830
<v Speaker 5>What they're saying this camera does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's made specifically for shooting</v>

2804
02:15:14.831 --> 02:15:17.650
<v Speaker 5>outdoor astronomy photos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got google,</v>

2805
02:15:17.710 --> 02:15:22.210
<v Speaker 5>the google star maps built into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the reason I don't,</v>

2806
02:15:22.270 --> 02:15:26.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure on this because I've tried</v>
<v Speaker 5>personally to take photos of stars and</v>

2807
02:15:26.021 --> 02:15:28.600
<v Speaker 5>the moon in different things in the sky</v>
<v Speaker 5>at night.</v>

2808
02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:32.140
<v Speaker 5>It's a really hard to do and like for</v>
<v Speaker 5>for one,</v>

2809
02:15:32.141 --> 02:15:35.290
<v Speaker 5>if you're trying to take a picture of</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they have done here,</v>

2810
02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:38.440
<v Speaker 5>which would be like the galaxy where you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can see the different gasses and</v>

2811
02:15:38.441 --> 02:15:40.750
<v Speaker 5>whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to leave your aperture open for</v>

2812
02:15:40.751 --> 02:15:43.090
<v Speaker 5>a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a couple of seconds and let the light</v>

2813
02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:45.600
<v Speaker 5>get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The opposite of that,</v>

2814
02:15:45.601 --> 02:15:48.030
<v Speaker 5>if you're trying to take a picture of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the moon and get detailed picture of the</v>

2815
02:15:48.031 --> 02:15:49.760
<v Speaker 5>moon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to go really quick because</v>

2816
02:15:49.761 --> 02:15:51.260
<v Speaker 5>there's so much light coming off of it.</v>

2817
02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:53.720
<v Speaker 5>You have to get this assistance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Snap second.</v>

2818
02:15:53.990 --> 02:15:55.400
<v Speaker 5>You have to have really good lens and</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatnot.</v>

2819
02:15:55.850 --> 02:15:59.390
<v Speaker 5>This camera is good for both and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>about the same size as a point and shoot</v>

2820
02:15:59.391 --> 02:16:03.700
<v Speaker 5>camera and it says that they're allowing</v>
<v Speaker 5>you to take all the and I don't know</v>

2821
02:16:03.701 --> 02:16:06.850
<v Speaker 5>exactly how because I couldn't take this</v>
<v Speaker 5>outside myself and play with it.</v>

2822
02:16:06.970 --> 02:16:09.310
<v Speaker 5>WhAt do they say when you asked them to</v>
<v Speaker 5>describe how it works?</v>

2823
02:16:09.311 --> 02:16:10.570
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't ask.</v>

2824
02:16:10.571 --> 02:16:13.030
<v Speaker 5>I heard this guy giving a description to</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody else.</v>

2825
02:16:13.870 --> 02:16:17.260
<v Speaker 5>They didn't really give a great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is all the data and this is how</v>

2826
02:16:17.261 --> 02:16:19.600
<v Speaker 5>everything is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is how it actually works.</v>

2827
02:16:19.660 --> 02:16:21.940
<v Speaker 5>They have some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have a software which said it was</v>

2828
02:16:21.941 --> 02:16:25.810
<v Speaker 5>like a patent pending on some noise</v>
<v Speaker 5>reduction filters,</v>

2829
02:16:25.811 --> 02:16:30.811
<v Speaker 5>which would be reducing noise on your</v>
<v Speaker 5>photo and sort post after the fact,</v>

2830
02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.240
<v Speaker 5>which I don't know if that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's tricking it or if it's just</v>

2831
02:16:34.241 --> 02:16:36.940
<v Speaker 5>removing some of the data from your</v>
<v Speaker 5>picture to make it look like a better</v>

2832
02:16:36.941 --> 02:16:40.510
<v Speaker 5>picture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was being advertised on lots of</v>

2833
02:16:40.511 --> 02:16:44.620
<v Speaker 5>different outlets as this is maybe they</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually got hands on and I didn't and</v>

2834
02:16:44.621 --> 02:16:46.450
<v Speaker 5>they got to see that it was proven so</v>

2835
02:16:46.570 --> 02:16:47.920
<v Speaker 6>well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'd be really interesting if it was</v>

2836
02:16:47.921 --> 02:16:49.720
<v Speaker 6>true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you could just point a camera up and</v>

2837
02:16:49.721 --> 02:16:51.940
<v Speaker 6>take a picture of the galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that would be the shit,</v>

2838
02:16:53.950 --> 02:16:55.480
<v Speaker 6>but you would have to have no light</v>
<v Speaker 6>pollution.</v>

2839
02:16:55.481 --> 02:16:56.350
<v Speaker 6>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's not.</v>

2840
02:16:56.410 --> 02:16:57.500
<v Speaker 6>No way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would see through the law.</v>

2841
02:16:57.530 --> 02:16:58.680
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to go somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2842
02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:00.130
<v Speaker 6>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is this thing?</v>

2843
02:17:00.490 --> 02:17:04.630
<v Speaker 5>So this is another like vr.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The skies flying around in space.</v>

2844
02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:07.460
<v Speaker 6>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were looking at this guy leaning</v>

2845
02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:10.820
<v Speaker 6>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's got his forearms and his hands</v>

2846
02:17:10.821 --> 02:17:13.880
<v Speaker 6>connected to this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These two handles on the front and the</v>

2847
02:17:13.881 --> 02:17:16.810
<v Speaker 6>back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His feet are strapped into this thing,</v>

2848
02:17:16.811 --> 02:17:19.780
<v Speaker 6>so he's kind of planking the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't look good if there's anything</v>

2849
02:17:19.781 --> 02:17:21.620
<v Speaker 6>on his stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that correct or is there something on</v>

2850
02:17:21.621 --> 02:17:22.260
<v Speaker 6>his stomach?</v>

2851
02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:25.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think that's hard to do,</v>

2852
02:17:25.201 --> 02:17:26.520
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't look.</v>

2853
02:17:26.550 --> 02:17:28.620
<v Speaker 5>It didn't look like the most comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2854
02:17:29.230 --> 02:17:31.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See he's leaning on his forearms and</v>

2855
02:17:31.721 --> 02:17:32.410
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

2856
02:17:32.410 --> 02:17:35.080
<v Speaker 6>he's steering himself with his own body</v>
<v Speaker 6>weight.</v>

2857
02:17:35.770 --> 02:17:38.140
<v Speaker 6>Well that would be a fucking vicious</v>
<v Speaker 6>workout man.</v>

2858
02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:40.680
<v Speaker 5>When you're flying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he'd be laying on</v>

2859
02:17:40.681 --> 02:17:43.670
<v Speaker 5>something really eat unless you were</v>
<v Speaker 5>flying on like a carpet or.</v>

2860
02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:44.360
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

2861
02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:47.330
<v Speaker 6>Well you still like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like his body is not subject to</v>

2862
02:17:47.331 --> 02:17:48.440
<v Speaker 6>gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but his stomach,</v>

2863
02:17:48.441 --> 02:17:53.441
<v Speaker 6>his body's being pulled down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you'd have to liKe really develop</v>

2864
02:17:53.481 --> 02:17:54.980
<v Speaker 6>your.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've bet a lot of people gonna hurt</v>

2865
02:17:54.981 --> 02:17:58.640
<v Speaker 6>their back on that because like you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to do it and you're going to strap</v>

2866
02:17:58.641 --> 02:18:01.400
<v Speaker 6>yourself into that thing and you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to get to a point where you're too</v>

2867
02:18:01.401 --> 02:18:02.870
<v Speaker 6>exhausted to keep planking</v>

2868
02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:06.100
<v Speaker 5>or what it says up here in the corner</v>
<v Speaker 5>underneath their little banner that says</v>

2869
02:18:06.101 --> 02:18:09.370
<v Speaker 5>it's good for exercise your core and</v>
<v Speaker 5>your upper body and all that.</v>

2870
02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:10.990
<v Speaker 6>Oh dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people are going to be bulletproof.</v>

2871
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:14.020
<v Speaker 6>They keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if that's going to be one of those</v>

2872
02:18:14.021 --> 02:18:16.180
<v Speaker 6>dance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dance revolution type things where</v>

2873
02:18:16.181 --> 02:18:19.660
<v Speaker 6>people start doing it and they get in</v>
<v Speaker 6>shaped because of it because like this</v>

2874
02:18:19.661 --> 02:18:23.350
<v Speaker 6>looks really hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You remember that thing that we had on</v>

2875
02:18:23.351 --> 02:18:28.351
<v Speaker 6>the podcast that we reviewed that frog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You remember the frog,</v>

2876
02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:31.150
<v Speaker 6>brent?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe shop was telling us about it,</v>

2877
02:18:31.660 --> 02:18:36.580
<v Speaker 6>but it's a a weight thing that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Will you move your body forward and</v>

2878
02:18:36.581 --> 02:18:37.970
<v Speaker 6>backward?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2879
02:18:38.350 --> 02:18:40.600
<v Speaker 6>It's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what I'm talking about?</v>

2880
02:18:40.601 --> 02:18:44.140
<v Speaker 6>And you actually move forward and</v>
<v Speaker 6>backward with it.</v>

2881
02:18:45.270 --> 02:18:50.260
<v Speaker 6>I think it's called the frog,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it looks remarkably similar to that</v>

2882
02:18:50.261 --> 02:18:55.261
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So imagine if you have a game where you</v>

2883
02:18:55.421 --> 02:19:00.220
<v Speaker 6>put virtual reality headsets on and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>do that frog workout thing.</v>

2884
02:19:01.540 --> 02:19:02.373
<v Speaker 6>You can't find it.</v>

2885
02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:05.110
<v Speaker 6>Give it a try.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I typed in frog and it's just given me</v>

2886
02:19:05.111 --> 02:19:06.790
<v Speaker 6>pictures of frogs lifting weights and</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff.</v>

2887
02:19:08.110 --> 02:19:10.600
<v Speaker 6>What about frog?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Weightlifting equipment?</v>

2888
02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:13.160
<v Speaker 6>The frog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The bull frog?</v>

2889
02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:15.190
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that it?</v>

2890
02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.640
<v Speaker 6>What it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>folks is you know that the way a frog</v>

2891
02:19:18.641 --> 02:19:23.641
<v Speaker 6>looks when it's moving across water,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when it has those kicks with its back</v>

2892
02:19:23.981 --> 02:19:26.560
<v Speaker 6>legs and it's four legs and they come</v>
<v Speaker 6>together and then they go apart.</v>

2893
02:19:26.561 --> 02:19:27.920
<v Speaker 6>Frog fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There it is.</v>

2894
02:19:29.290 --> 02:19:33.550
<v Speaker 6>And this thing is this weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's got wheels in the front and wheels</v>

2895
02:19:33.551 --> 02:19:37.990
<v Speaker 6>on the back and you connect your feet to</v>
<v Speaker 6>the base of it and your upper body to</v>

2896
02:19:37.991 --> 02:19:40.080
<v Speaker 6>the front of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>SkuchA heads.</v>

2897
02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:41.710
<v Speaker 6>We could see these guys doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You look,</v>

2898
02:19:41.711 --> 02:19:45.370
<v Speaker 6>I got a football,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's a serious piece of workout.</v>

2899
02:19:45.371 --> 02:19:49.450
<v Speaker 6>See here you see this guy moving with</v>
<v Speaker 6>this thing back and forth and back and</v>

2900
02:19:49.451 --> 02:19:51.770
<v Speaker 6>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

2901
02:19:53.420 --> 02:19:55.880
<v Speaker 6>I think you can change the resistance in</v>
<v Speaker 6>those cables.</v>

2902
02:19:55.881 --> 02:20:00.881
<v Speaker 6>You can make it more difficult to do and</v>
<v Speaker 6>apparently it gets you in sick shape.</v>

2903
02:20:03.640 --> 02:20:07.000
<v Speaker 6>I've heard a lot of people talking about</v>
<v Speaker 6>this thing saying it's a tremendous</v>

2904
02:20:07.210 --> 02:20:09.880
<v Speaker 6>piece of a strength and conditioning</v>
<v Speaker 6>equipment by open.</v>

2905
02:20:10.180 --> 02:20:11.013
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's 1:30.</v>

2906
02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:12.490
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll bring in hunter mott's.</v>

2907
02:20:12.520 --> 02:20:16.690
<v Speaker 6>That'll be a podcast too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But imagine doing this with like handles</v>

2908
02:20:17.410 --> 02:20:21.670
<v Speaker 6>virtual reality and you're doing a game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean these guys are crawling along</v>

2909
02:20:21.671 --> 02:20:22.504
<v Speaker 6>with this thing.</v>

2910
02:20:23.710 --> 02:20:27.310
<v Speaker 6>Imagine if you're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you think you're flying a spaceship</v>

2911
02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:31.490
<v Speaker 6>and you're shooting shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We need to Just need to get virtual</v>

2912
02:20:31.491 --> 02:20:34.640
<v Speaker 6>reality in a bigger Spaces so we can be</v>
<v Speaker 6>moving around and be playing with each</v>

2913
02:20:34.641 --> 02:20:35.840
<v Speaker 6>other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's a big,</v>

2914
02:20:36.170 --> 02:20:37.350
<v Speaker 6>big gap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We need still to,</v>

2915
02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:38.240
<v Speaker 6>to be fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2916
02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:39.340
<v Speaker 6>Football fields.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2917
02:20:39.470 --> 02:20:41.640
<v Speaker 6>Virtual reality on football fields.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We also don't want to be.</v>

2918
02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:44.210
<v Speaker 6>We need to not bike.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If we both have on headsets,</v>

2919
02:20:44.211 --> 02:20:45.890
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to bump into you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

2920
02:20:46.100 --> 02:20:49.370
<v Speaker 6>that's big.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I figured that next step to interesting</v>

2921
02:20:49.371 --> 02:20:50.210
<v Speaker 6>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Young Jamie.</v>

2922
02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:52.200
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll be right back with hunter mott's.</v>
