<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

21
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I got to come up with something creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So if you want one dude,</v>

25
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.580

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

26
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just sent me a big buck</v>

27
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 2>and I brought one for studio flashlight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it lasted less than 24 hours.</v>

28
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 2>I brought it here and I was just going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to use it.</v>

29
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Just show it you just in case people ask</v>
<v Speaker 2>about flashlight because everyone always</v>

30
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:25.370
<v Speaker 2>asks about what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what's this?</v>

32
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 2>And so I had it for less than 24 hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>and was like,</v>

00:01:50.751 --> 00:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>ridiculous we are.</v>

49
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Completely ridiculous that we would care</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all about pleasure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've sounded it so many times.</v>

92
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:54.970

118
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.930
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're fascinated by it,</v>

119
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 1>a far better description than I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever give is on [inaudible] dot com.</v>

120
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.090
<v Speaker 1>That's o n n I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>t and M.</v>

121
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.400
<v Speaker 1>There's also a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an enhanced science of Alpha brain where</v>

122
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:08.890
<v Speaker 1>we've updated due to some criticisms </v>
<v Speaker 1>updated.</v>

123
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.130
<v Speaker 1>We hired a science advisor and updated </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way everything is described and </v>

124
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 1>everyone's trying to be as above board </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cooled this as possible.</v>

125
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 1>So that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're fascinated by nootropics,</v>

126
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.770
<v Speaker 1>go to [inaudible] dot com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>O n n I t enter in code named Rogan.</v>

127
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Speaker 1>You get 10 percent off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just the first order either.</v>

128
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Now it's as many orders as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fixed that shit.</v>

129
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Powerful.</v>

130
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Daniella boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least in the house.</v>

131
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.910
<v Speaker 4>You're like a 12 year old DJ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like the kind of like sound </v>

132
00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 4>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would be really interesting.</v>

133
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.820
<v Speaker 3>I was a Dj and I was 12.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

134
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.230

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

137
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those sports guys are hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>handle.</v>

138
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>With this special breed of guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like shit on athletes,</v>

140
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like some of them that are just </v>

141
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.530
<v Speaker 1>sports broadcasters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of those dudes like they do.</v>

142
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the like he's a bomb.</v>

143
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.290
<v Speaker 1>He's always been a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll never get off the bench and you're</v>

144
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

145
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Like you're talking about like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional athlete.</v>

146
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Their son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better settle the fuck down man.</v>

147
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 1>You're getting a little crazy with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>insults,</v>

148
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.690
<v Speaker 1>their fat guy in front of a microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you,</v>

149
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that insult shit.</v>

150
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniella Bolelli my friend or shut up.</v>

151
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So brother,</v>

152
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 1>you are a scholar of religious history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

153
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean you are essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

154
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the best way to describe </v>

155
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.010
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are actually a professor on it.</v>

156
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you think that it is that we live</v>

157
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.090
<v Speaker 1>in 2012 and we have this incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>depth of religion.</v>

158
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.960
<v Speaker 1>It's still controlling our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is it possible that something that </v>

159
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.981
<v Speaker 1>seemed so like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems so if you were rationally </v>

160
00:07:11.981 --> 00:07:12.380
<v Speaker 1>looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would go,</v>

161
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:17.381
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's some truth behind any of </v>

162
00:07:17.381 --> 00:07:17.381
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

163
00:07:17.381 --> 00:07:20.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's some truth behind the </v>

164
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:21.911
<v Speaker 1>origins of the creation of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but clearly this shit has been written </v>

165
00:07:21.911 --> 00:07:24.020
<v Speaker 1>by people and we're going to base our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives on this.</v>

166
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:29.021
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People when they say base our lives,</v>

167
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.260
<v Speaker 1>most people will say they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then of course when it's convenient,</v>

168
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.330
<v Speaker 1>when it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

169
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 1>let's conveniently forget a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>passages.</v>

170
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Like there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but aren't those the safest ones?</v>

171
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 1>The ones that stick to the code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the most danger.</v>

172
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:45.520
<v Speaker 1>The ones that want to throw rocks at </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

173
00:07:45.521 --> 00:07:49.880
<v Speaker 1>like dancing a Christian girl who slept </v>
<v Speaker 1>around every now and then.</v>

174
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.650
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like way better.</v>

175
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.410
<v Speaker 1>I've seen someone who completely stick </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the code.</v>

176
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

177
00:07:55.010 --> 00:08:00.010
<v Speaker 1>but I mean several of the sinks are </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they boiled it down to wheat or </v>

178
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 1>now the type of questions that no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>has an answer to and sort of fact these,</v>

179
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>unless you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people always say,</v>

180
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:09.611
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good already in decades we go for </v>

181
00:08:09.611 --> 00:08:10.580
<v Speaker 1>science and reason and we need to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrational and don't get me wrong.</v>

182
00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:15.581
<v Speaker 1>Give me a reason why he's a great tool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it doesn't give you answers to </v>

183
00:08:15.581 --> 00:08:16.580
<v Speaker 1>things that scare the hell out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

184
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.940
<v Speaker 1>people are going to want some answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether they are bullshit dancers or </v>

185
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:21.940
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>

186
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me some answer because otherwise </v>

187
00:08:25.331 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 1>it's just damn scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His religion than a tool to allow people</v>

188
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 1>to psychologically adapt to the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage of evolution.</v>

189
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something like a placeholder.</v>

190
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it's what people need to </v>

191
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.971
<v Speaker 1>deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that I can't deal with </v>

192
00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:41.891
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible at all that any of it is </v>

193
00:08:41.891 --> 00:08:45.521
<v Speaker 1>based on reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean know that so it sounds </v>

194
00:08:45.521 --> 00:08:45.770
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so does the universe itself,</v>

195
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.140
<v Speaker 1>like the universe itself is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

196
00:08:48.141 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 1>The Big Bang is pretty ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't claim to know shit,</v>

197
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:53.330
<v Speaker 1>so who knows what's up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

198
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe or disbelieve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

199
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>my</v>

200
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.040
<v Speaker 5>attitude is there's what I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>experienced and there's every single </v>

201
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.040
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

202
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.440
<v Speaker 5>What I've experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kind of know.</v>

203
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 5>And every single males who the hell </v>
<v Speaker 5>knows,</v>

204
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:09.141
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it pissed me off when people </v>

205
00:09:09.141 --> 00:09:11.421
<v Speaker 5>assume that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they themselves as an Evan </v>

206
00:09:11.421 --> 00:09:14.540
<v Speaker 5>expedience somewhere that's the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 5>truth and everybody needs to believe </v>

207
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:14.540
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

208
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.480
<v Speaker 5>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

209
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:20.480
<v Speaker 5>How nuts would it be if you died and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>really were at a date in the cloud,</v>

210
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.160
<v Speaker 5>how psychedelic would that be if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>really did have a dude,</v>

211
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.510
<v Speaker 5>St Peter who's like the FBI who's just </v>
<v Speaker 5>been following your license,</v>

212
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 5>you're a baby and he's like going over </v>
<v Speaker 5>day,</v>

213
00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 5>why'd you do this and why'd you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like fucking really.</v>

214
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Speaker 5>That would really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would wearing a mom and she.</v>

215
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.960
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does that really stand for </v>

216
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:43.960
<v Speaker 5>something though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

217
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if that ideal that this ideal </v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

218
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having to live like a Karma free life </v>

219
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.221
<v Speaker 5>and having to like have done only good </v>
<v Speaker 5>things only be pure and then you get to </v>

220
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.750
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a moment.</v>

221
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.710
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that what they're,</v>

222
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.100
<v Speaker 5>are they envisioning a moment of </v>
<v Speaker 5>ultimate enlightenment?</v>

223
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.180
<v Speaker 5>When you're framing what is the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

224
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.330
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the heaven,</v>

225
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:11.510
<v Speaker 5>like where's it coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it coming from the need for the next </v>

226
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:11.510
<v Speaker 5>level?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're the,</v>

227
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:16.510
<v Speaker 5>the possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would be the best possible </v>

228
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:16.510
<v Speaker 5>scenario?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best possible scenarios.</v>

229
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.270
<v Speaker 5>All loved ones would be in the clouds </v>
<v Speaker 5>forever and ever.</v>

230
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.540
<v Speaker 5>But really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how fucking long would that last before </v>

231
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.260
<v Speaker 5>you were bored as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you imagine if that's heaven,</v>

232
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 5>you're just hanging out in the clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't drive anywhere.</v>

233
00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:33.390
<v Speaker 5>You can't go to the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's up together and having,</v>

234
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.970
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's ridiculous.</v>

235
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.670
<v Speaker 5>No flashlights were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all have wings now,</v>

236
00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:40.680
<v Speaker 5>so we just fly around up here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

237
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 5>what do we do after a while?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get bored.</v>

238
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.800
<v Speaker 5>Where are you getting your food?</v>

239
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.450
<v Speaker 5>You're in the clouds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

240
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 5>you eating fucking cloud fish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you doing?</v>

241
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:50.400
<v Speaker 5>Where are you getting your food?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is ridiculous.</v>

242
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.590
<v Speaker 5>We don't need food anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

243
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:54.650
<v Speaker 5>What is there to live for?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be my question.</v>

244
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.170
<v Speaker 5>Are their flashlights in Africa?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you fucking have it?</v>

245
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 5>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about that question?</v>

246
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.230
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you fucking heaven.</v>

247
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.650
<v Speaker 5>If there was heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you be allowed to?</v>

248
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.950
<v Speaker 5>So what if it was just like a smoker?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Replace.</v>

249
00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:06.660
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing was just smoke here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

250
00:11:06.661 --> 00:11:08.170
<v Speaker 5>like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not allowed to smoke,</v>

251
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:09.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>

252
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.510
<v Speaker 5>So like you can have full relationships </v>
<v Speaker 5>and get girls pregnant.</v>

253
00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:15.930
<v Speaker 5>You can still get a driver's license,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but everything's just really smokey.</v>

254
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that sounds.</v>

255
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.440
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But fucking talks because you're in </v>

256
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.100
<v Speaker 5>heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all cloudy clouds.</v>

257
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.510
<v Speaker 5>So it's like real life book Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like maybe hit Seattle.</v>

258
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.070
<v Speaker 5>Seattle.</v>

259
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm definitely going to vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

260
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.000
<v Speaker 4>Vegas.</v>

261
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.730
<v Speaker 5>Vegas is some sort of purgatory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

262
00:11:41.731 --> 00:11:42.680
<v Speaker 5>that's definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

263
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.210
<v Speaker 5>it's like in their logo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>State motto.</v>

264
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.890
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it is.</v>

265
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:52.760
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

266
00:11:52.761 --> 00:11:53.990
<v Speaker 4>There's about the</v>

267
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:59.040
<v Speaker 5>human behavior man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you get them in that frying pan </v>

268
00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 5>frying pan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is Las Vegas,</v>

269
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.390
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate it now.</v>

270
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:06.510
<v Speaker 5>I just don't even want to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just went two days ago and Jesus just </v>

271
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:06.820
<v Speaker 5>that drive there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

272
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.770
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forgot how bad it is,</v>

273
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.360
<v Speaker 5>but it's fun to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As it is,</v>

274
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.770
<v Speaker 5>it's the best place to go see fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like no other place.</v>

275
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:20.390
<v Speaker 5>Like it's going to the best club,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a bar one night and then you're </v>

276
00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:20.950
<v Speaker 5>hanging out there for a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

277
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.080
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a weird town.</v>

278
00:12:23.081 --> 00:12:25.840
<v Speaker 5>I like Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of things I like about.</v>

279
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.080
<v Speaker 5>There's plenty of cool people in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

280
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:33.390
<v Speaker 5>It's just the reality is when you get </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and you just let them go free </v>

281
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.520
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you give them 24 hour free rein,</v>

282
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.730
<v Speaker 5>go drink and you just wind up doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous shit.</v>

283
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.820
<v Speaker 5>That's what I need though because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>see these people that are doing or why </v>

284
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.060
<v Speaker 5>do we know this sheets and you know that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are the ones who are at 9:00</v>

285
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.900
<v Speaker 5>AM at tie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I'm like,</v>

286
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.790
<v Speaker 5>this is the current,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Florida's lave is the.</v>

287
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:57.420
<v Speaker 5>I know it must be a fucking grind and </v>
<v Speaker 5>try to go back to work after a weekend </v>

288
00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.890
<v Speaker 5>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people who lived there,</v>

289
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:04.891
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they must get an extraordinary view of </v>

290
00:13:04.891 --> 00:13:04.891
<v Speaker 5>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have like,</v>

291
00:13:04.891 --> 00:13:08.530
<v Speaker 5>they would be like great psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People live in Vegas.</v>

292
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 5>They probably understand a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

293
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.790
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you work at a casino,</v>

294
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:17.870
<v Speaker 5>say if feel like some dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could be like a guy who's like a </v>

295
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.960
<v Speaker 5>real crafty dude who lives in vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could really describe humanity in a very</v>

296
00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:24.961
<v Speaker 5>unusual level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably know any of the show and just </v>

297
00:13:24.961 --> 00:13:24.961
<v Speaker 5>see them at their real estate.</v>

298
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.480
<v Speaker 5>Just the idea that you would get people </v>
<v Speaker 5>and allow them to drink through all </v>

299
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.780
<v Speaker 5>hours of the night thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drink whenever they want.</v>

300
00:13:31.781 --> 00:13:33.760
<v Speaker 5>Like nobody ever tells you to stop </v>
<v Speaker 5>drinking.</v>

301
00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:37.250
<v Speaker 5>It's so ridiculous that just drinks it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you need a drink.</v>

302
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.640
<v Speaker 5>Like why are you can still drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is crazy.</v>

303
00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:43.060
<v Speaker 5>It's just that alone is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

304
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.280
<v Speaker 5>we're just a note.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one's used to that shit.</v>

305
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.900
<v Speaker 5>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's a weird thing.</v>

306
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.330
<v Speaker 5>Alcohol removes inhibition and then you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>

307
00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 5>So it's like just that alone is what </v>
<v Speaker 5>makes Vegas fucking completely insane.</v>

308
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:54.460
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wanted freedom.</v>

309
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:55.390
<v Speaker 5>Here you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got it.</v>

310
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.020
<v Speaker 5>Let's see how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is.</v>

311
00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.300
<v Speaker 5>Dan was the first time that I actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>was anywhere rather than on the street.</v>

312
00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:01.900
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

313
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.400
<v Speaker 5>there are actually people living here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

314
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.850
<v Speaker 5>This weird filter was just an adult.</v>

315
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.570
<v Speaker 5>He's not on there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'd love it though.</v>

316
00:14:07.571 --> 00:14:09.520
<v Speaker 5>I love the fact that there's is a place </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

317
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.220
<v Speaker 5>I love the fact that there's a place </v>
<v Speaker 5>where people can gamble.</v>

318
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.920
<v Speaker 5>I don't even gamble,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I love that you could just go gamble</v>

319
00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:16.000
<v Speaker 5>at 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the morning.</v>

320
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.070
<v Speaker 5>I don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if I was into it,</v>

321
00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:19.960
<v Speaker 5>I would love the fact that I could just </v>
<v Speaker 5>do that.</v>

322
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:20.770
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

323
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.040
<v Speaker 5>I hate the fact that you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

324
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.970
<v Speaker 5>you have to go somewhere for something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

325
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:30.150
<v Speaker 5>You know that we restrict that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior everywhere else that's big </v>

326
00:14:30.401 --> 00:14:35.401
<v Speaker 5>enough that our lead Gen is one other </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that pissed me off the most </v>

327
00:14:35.401 --> 00:14:35.860
<v Speaker 5>because I mean people being religious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have nothing against it.</v>

328
00:14:35.861 --> 00:14:40.861
<v Speaker 5>If it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it helps you being nicer to your </v>

329
00:14:40.861 --> 00:14:40.861
<v Speaker 5>neighbors or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good for you.</v>

330
00:14:40.861 --> 00:14:45.550
<v Speaker 5>The stamina piece me off to no end is </v>
<v Speaker 5>when they want to impose their own </v>

331
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.240
<v Speaker 5>morality on you and so the victim of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this crime slow,</v>

332
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no gambling,</v>

333
00:14:49.451 --> 00:14:51.920
<v Speaker 5>no show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no drugs,</v>

334
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:57.310
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is there a positive message in </v>

335
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.630
<v Speaker 1>trying to control some vices?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

336
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.640
<v Speaker 1>is there a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there anything that you could say as </v>

337
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:03.640
<v Speaker 1>far as like social engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like man,</v>

338
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.940
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to have a really safe </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

339
00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:07.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe what'd you make?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prostitution illegal.</v>

340
00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:12.161
<v Speaker 1>Would you make drugs illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you try to suppress it or would </v>

341
00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:17.171
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the safer thing would </v>

342
00:15:17.171 --> 00:15:19.691
<v Speaker 1>be to just decriminalize it and let </v>
<v Speaker 1>people figure it out for themselves?</v>

343
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Mediamath regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of like the way that the dam or</v>

344
00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:24.830
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

345
00:15:24.831 --> 00:15:29.831
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you have some safety standards </v>

346
00:15:29.831 --> 00:15:32.510
<v Speaker 1>is good for everybody involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You limit the damage that people can do </v>

347
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:33.270
<v Speaker 1>to themselves and to others that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

348
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.750
<v Speaker 1>it's your choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which our life.</v>

349
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weird thing,</v>

350
00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:37.880
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

351
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just the idea that you can control </v>

352
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.820
<v Speaker 1>what other people do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only to a certain extent.</v>

353
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't say that we can control </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn yet.</v>

354
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Although there was a thing about Newt </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gingrich and Mitt Romney and Rick </v>

355
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Santorum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them are going to go after porn.</v>

356
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Was that who it was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was that.</v>

357
00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.640
<v Speaker 1>It was at least two of those characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go after porn I think was</v>

358
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:03.040
<v Speaker 1>gingrich and Santorum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about.</v>

359
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Not that it makes much difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>because those guys are,</v>

360
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different shades of gray.</v>

361
00:16:07.131 --> 00:16:12.131
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird the now anyone on or could</v>

362
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.020
<v Speaker 1>devote for Santorum scare the shit out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of me.</v>

363
00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:18.020
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are voting for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love this guy.</v>

364
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.240
<v Speaker 1>What do you think they're connecting to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

365
00:16:20.241 --> 00:16:22.160
<v Speaker 1>you as a person who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

366
00:16:22.161 --> 00:16:23.930
<v Speaker 1>he's obviously the message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

367
00:16:23.931 --> 00:16:26.260
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit of it is that is religious.</v>

368
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:31.830
<v Speaker 5>I mean that kind of stuff you'd boys </v>
<v Speaker 5>down to somebody will give you the image</v>

369
00:16:31.841 --> 00:16:33.600
<v Speaker 5>of what you would want to have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are,</v>

370
00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.300
<v Speaker 5>we promote all the good guys will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

371
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.640

<v Speaker 5>The bad guys will be pioneers.</v>

372
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.550
<v Speaker 5>We stand for morality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we squash anything else.</v>

373
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:47.610
<v Speaker 5>And the thing that makes some of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people feel good is we'll squash every </v>

374
00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:51.191
<v Speaker 5>one else who doesn't agree with living </v>
<v Speaker 5>life the way we do so we can impose our </v>

375
00:16:52.061 --> 00:16:57.061
<v Speaker 5>happy dog mountain of anyone else </v>
<v Speaker 5>because that ultimately is the kind of </v>

376
00:16:57.061 --> 00:16:57.390
<v Speaker 5>shit that he stands for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's a,</v>

377
00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:58.990
<v Speaker 5>people like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

00:16:58.991 --> 00:17:03.991
<v Speaker 5>he's not just 30 Joanie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you look even outside of early John </v>

<v Speaker 5>People voted for a color,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

380
00:17:03.991 --> 00:17:05.620
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't just purely taking power.</v>

381
00:17:05.621 --> 00:17:10.621
<v Speaker 5>People like Nazism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people like the hardcore form of </v>

382
00:17:10.621 --> 00:17:10.621
<v Speaker 5>communism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people like,</v>

389
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.150
<v Speaker 1>it's based on numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

392
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.281
<v Speaker 1>much if he doesn't have a belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anybody who believes something that </v>

393
00:17:41.281 --> 00:17:45.490
<v Speaker 1>they can't really prove and believed it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a point where they're willing to base</v>

394
00:17:45.491 --> 00:17:46.960
<v Speaker 1>their lives on it like that.</v>

441
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:54.010
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why we're free.</v>

442
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.240
<v Speaker 5>We're free gear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

443
00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:01.810
<v Speaker 5>Is that in the Bible?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that the Bible was </v>

444
00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.380
<v Speaker 5>initially created just to try to keep </v>
<v Speaker 5>people in line?</v>

445
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.260
<v Speaker 5>You think it was created,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like look and these are some stories.</v>

446
00:20:06.261 --> 00:20:11.261
<v Speaker 5>This is some lessons that we've learned </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then it just kinda like got out of </v>

447
00:20:11.261 --> 00:20:12.860
<v Speaker 5>control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I think it goes both ways.</v>

448
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:17.890
<v Speaker 5>There's some.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes you use it as a tool to </v>

449
00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:18.380
<v Speaker 5>control people's behavior if you feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they are to fuck it up,</v>

450
00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.290
<v Speaker 5>but also it's an internal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he's not just a,</v>

451
00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:26.340
<v Speaker 5>I know this is bullshit about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to feed it to them just so I </v>

452
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.220
<v Speaker 5>keep it a crazy scene line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I also think that sound,</v>

453
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.200
<v Speaker 5>the people themselves who started some </v>
<v Speaker 5>of these things feel needy.</v>

454
00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.860
<v Speaker 5>They desperately need it to the point </v>
<v Speaker 5>where they will.</v>

455
00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.550
<v Speaker 5>They are going to be the first one to </v>
<v Speaker 5>stick their own lives on it and that's I</v>

456
00:20:37.551 --> 00:20:38.780
<v Speaker 5>guess the Santorum thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

457
00:20:38.781 --> 00:20:40.520
<v Speaker 5>You want to leave that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

458
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.290
<v Speaker 5>I think our knots,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but whatever.</v>

459
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:47.320
<v Speaker 5>It's your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should be free to do whatever you </v>

460
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:47.320
<v Speaker 5>want when you want to impose it on </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone else.</v>

461
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.600
<v Speaker 5>That's when you'll piss me off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's when it gets scary.</v>

462
00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:49.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

463
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:55.140
<v Speaker 7>Which is bizarre to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anybody who really absolutely believe </v>

464
00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:55.570
<v Speaker 7>something that much is bizarre to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

465
00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.960
<v Speaker 7>Like why do you believe in what you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Where are you seeing this?</v>

466
00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.600
<v Speaker 7>You really believe that book Zen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What's going on?</v>

467
00:21:00.601 --> 00:21:01.240
<v Speaker 7>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 7>This said,</v>

468
00:21:01.241 --> 00:21:05.070
<v Speaker 7>that's how that seems crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you're banking it all in one book.</v>

469
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.480
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of books,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

470
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.190
<v Speaker 7>don't let a lot of shit has been </v>
<v Speaker 7>written,</v>

471
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.050
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they're really.</v>

472
00:21:10.051 --> 00:21:12.060
<v Speaker 7>The shit that's the weirdest is the </v>
<v Speaker 7>oldest.</v>

473
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.530
<v Speaker 7>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's nonsense.</v>

474
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:17.040
<v Speaker 7>We need like a new behavior standard </v>
<v Speaker 7>guide for humans.</v>

475
00:21:17.041 --> 00:21:21.690
<v Speaker 7>That's what we need instead of a Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just a behavior standard guide so we can</v>

476
00:21:21.691 --> 00:21:26.691
<v Speaker 7>all get through this world like this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>These are the rules that we agree to </v>

477
00:21:26.691 --> 00:21:28.470
<v Speaker 7>instead have bestowed upon us by a </v>
<v Speaker 7>higher power.</v>

478
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.960
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you definitely shouldn't do most of this</v>

479
00:21:30.961 --> 00:21:32.030
<v Speaker 7>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The Bible says.</v>

480
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.230
<v Speaker 7>Tells you not to do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't be killing anybody.</v>

481
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.750
<v Speaker 7>Don't fuck your neighbor's wife.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All that stuff.</v>

482
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.010
<v Speaker 7>That's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

483
00:21:38.011 --> 00:21:39.160
<v Speaker 7>you really should.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's.</v>

484
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:44.220
<v Speaker 7>Those are good,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we need some more of those and we </v>

485
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.200
<v Speaker 7>need like a comprehensive guide just </v>
<v Speaker 7>based on what we all know to be.</v>

486
00:21:46.201 --> 00:21:48.060
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We all know,</v>

487
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:53.840
<v Speaker 7>I think this is the best time ever to do</v>
<v Speaker 7>something like that because even though </v>

488
00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.830
<v Speaker 7>people were complaining that times are </v>
<v Speaker 7>tough and unemployment is bad,</v>

489
00:21:55.831 --> 00:21:58.800
<v Speaker 7>and it certainly is economies and in </v>
<v Speaker 7>terrible position,</v>

490
00:21:58.801 --> 00:22:01.710
<v Speaker 7>but still better than any time in human </v>
<v Speaker 7>history.</v>

491
00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:06.740
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's really been no better time as </v>

492
00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.460
<v Speaker 7>far as like safety as far as like the </v>
<v Speaker 7>access to get food and medicine.</v>

493
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:13.890
<v Speaker 7>This if there's ever a time for us to </v>
<v Speaker 7>get our shit together.</v>

494
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.920
<v Speaker 7>Like on paper now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is it like together as like a group of </v>

495
00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.671
<v Speaker 7>humans instead of instead of bound by </v>
<v Speaker 7>some crazy words that were written first</v>

496
00:22:23.941 --> 00:22:25.590
<v Speaker 7>in ancient Hebrew.</v>
<v Speaker 7>First of all,</v>

497
00:22:25.591 --> 00:22:27.450
<v Speaker 7>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They were told as an oral tradition,</v>

498
00:22:27.451 --> 00:22:31.010
<v Speaker 7>Philip for thousand years first.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yet it's not for seven.</v>

499
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.510
<v Speaker 7>Orlando,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dr Kim.</v>

500
00:22:33.511 --> 00:22:38.511
<v Speaker 7>Imagine what the fuck happens to a story</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you tell it for hundreds of years </v>

501
00:22:38.511 --> 00:22:39.990
<v Speaker 7>before somebody figures out how to write</v>
<v Speaker 7>things.</v>

502
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.070
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's nuts.</v>

503
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.860
<v Speaker 7>What do you think about those Dead Sea </v>
<v Speaker 7>Scrolls?</v>

504
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:47.940
<v Speaker 7>Do you know much about that?</v>

505
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his artist sinks.</v>

506
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.200
<v Speaker 5>There's what are you fish?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our scriptures of every religion are one</v>

507
00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.930
<v Speaker 5>tiny part of what used to be out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then people,</v>

508
00:22:57.931 --> 00:22:59.400
<v Speaker 5>I mean you get to the kids as </v>
<v Speaker 5>Afghanistan,</v>

509
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:04.820
<v Speaker 5>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get to vote on which books are </v>

510
00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:04.820
<v Speaker 5>sacred and come from God and which ones </v>
<v Speaker 5>are not that mean.</v>

511
00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:09.800
<v Speaker 5>Can you believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like somebody's seat around the </v>

512
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:09.800
<v Speaker 5>table.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What it's like today,</v>

513
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.380
<v Speaker 5>right now we pull out some book and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

514
00:23:10.381 --> 00:23:12.510
<v Speaker 5>what do you think about it is these gods</v>
<v Speaker 5>are not.</v>

515
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.670
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>next let's talk about this one.</v>

516
00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:20.790
<v Speaker 5>It was really that arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I nearly.</v>

517
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.300
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many books were like left out?</v>

518
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.940
<v Speaker 5>Are those available?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows because a lot of these.</v>

519
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.140
<v Speaker 5>This is the end,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Bible.</v>

520
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.780
<v Speaker 5>A lot of these was because he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

521
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.910
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we decide this is God stuff and sold the</v>

522
00:23:35.911 --> 00:23:36.990
<v Speaker 5>other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well read it.</v>

523
00:23:36.991 --> 00:23:41.991
<v Speaker 5>If you want to noise like we have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>burn it because it must be the Davao </v>

524
00:23:41.991 --> 00:23:44.731
<v Speaker 5>son,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it must be terrible and horrible and </v>

525
00:23:44.731 --> 00:23:46.791
<v Speaker 5>we need to squash any possible other </v>
<v Speaker 5>alternative and soul that's burned them </v>

526
00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:46.791
<v Speaker 5>old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

527
00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:50.870
<v Speaker 5>And so when something goes pops up that </v>
<v Speaker 5>shows a different side to it that wasn't</v>

528
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.110
<v Speaker 5>made a part of the official Canon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it makes everybody feel like,</v>

529
00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:59.000
<v Speaker 5>what the hell is going on like is so we </v>
<v Speaker 5>can base our life on this or can we or I</v>

530
00:23:59.001 --> 00:24:01.550
<v Speaker 5>mean most people are going to ignore it </v>
<v Speaker 5>anyway because otherwise he masters with</v>

531
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.820
<v Speaker 5>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's a good idea.</v>

532
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.350
<v Speaker 5>What a weird time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

533
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:13.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking about like the concept of </v>

534
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:13.900
<v Speaker 5>faith,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the stuff that's at the basie self,</v>

535
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:13.900
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Judaism,</v>

536
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:14.330
<v Speaker 5>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Islam,</v>

537
00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.560
<v Speaker 5>think about like the story that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>own,</v>

538
00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:18.260
<v Speaker 5>the revere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They all think he's a great idea.</v>

539
00:24:18.261 --> 00:24:20.670
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God the shows up that say,</v>

540
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:25.690
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really think you should kill your </v>

541
00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:25.690
<v Speaker 5>song.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they,</v>

542
00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:25.690
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

543
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.230
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to kill my song,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

544
00:24:27.231 --> 00:24:29.340
<v Speaker 5>if it's God speaking wedding decades,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

545
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.100
<v Speaker 5>bye.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on,</v>

546
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.540
<v Speaker 5>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's about to kill him.</v>

547
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:34.350
<v Speaker 5>And then God sends an angel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say,</v>

548
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.590
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

549
00:24:34.591 --> 00:24:35.030
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

550
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.310
<v Speaker 5>just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just testing your faith.</v>

551
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.150
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just checking.</v>

552
00:24:38.151 --> 00:24:43.151
<v Speaker 5>You pass the test.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You did very well and now you're </v>

553
00:24:43.151 --> 00:24:43.460
<v Speaker 5>rewarded for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

554
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.850
<v Speaker 5>last time I check when you hear these </v>
<v Speaker 5>embodied voices telling you,</v>

555
00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:51.851
<v Speaker 5>you should kill people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>least thinning to that is not what </v>

556
00:24:51.851 --> 00:24:52.910
<v Speaker 5>should make you the guy who everybody </v>
<v Speaker 5>looks up to.</v>

557
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.190
<v Speaker 5>One thing we want a great example of </v>
<v Speaker 5>faith.</v>

558
00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:59.300
<v Speaker 5>You analyzing what a crazy story God </v>
<v Speaker 5>wants you to kill your baby.</v>

559
00:24:59.301 --> 00:25:01.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck,</v>

560
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:06.041
<v Speaker 5>and you're gonna kill your baby for God </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that was the right thing to do and </v>

561
00:25:06.041 --> 00:25:07.580
<v Speaker 5>God said he was just testing you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

562
00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.400
<v Speaker 5>That's a sign.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That good job you'll pass.</v>

563
00:25:10.401 --> 00:25:15.401
<v Speaker 5>The test is that Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Old Testament is about as wonky as </v>

564
00:25:15.401 --> 00:25:15.401
<v Speaker 5>it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

565
00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:20.460
<v Speaker 5>Predictive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they said that the Dead Sea scrolls </v>

566
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:20.460
<v Speaker 5>were even wonkier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you know,</v>

567
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:24.191
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of dead sea scrolls stuff </v>

568
00:25:24.191 --> 00:25:24.250
<v Speaker 5>that hasn't even been included.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is the oldest written version,</v>

569
00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:25.550
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jazz,</v>

570
00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:29.110
<v Speaker 5>because it's not part of the official </v>
<v Speaker 5>cannon,</v>

571
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:34.120
<v Speaker 5>doesn't mean that it's all good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's not like he's easy to fall </v>

572
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:34.120
<v Speaker 5>into the pattern of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

573
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:38.621
<v Speaker 5>these evil bastards a manipulated the </v>
<v Speaker 5>seeings put on these horrible things in </v>

574
00:25:38.621 --> 00:25:38.930
<v Speaker 5>the books.</v>

575
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.030
<v Speaker 5>And so every scene that got squashed </v>
<v Speaker 5>must be good.</v>

576
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.900
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not really.</v>

577
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:43.440
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the stuff that got squashed,</v>

578
00:25:43.441 --> 00:25:44.810
<v Speaker 5>it's probably even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>

579
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.720
<v Speaker 5>So I love the fact that the Dead Sea </v>
<v Speaker 5>Scrolls,</v>

580
00:25:47.721 --> 00:25:50.750
<v Speaker 5>it was always linked to crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People were always like,</v>

581
00:25:50.751 --> 00:25:55.751
<v Speaker 5>it's always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have photos and mushrooms and it's </v>

582
00:25:55.751 --> 00:25:55.751
<v Speaker 5>like every,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every wacky,</v>

583
00:25:55.751 --> 00:25:58.190
<v Speaker 5>crazy story is linked to the Dead Sea </v>
<v Speaker 5>Scrolls,</v>

584
00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:01.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even the fact they found them,</v>

585
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the coolest things is,</v>

586
00:26:03.021 --> 00:26:08.021
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the science of putting together the </v>

587
00:26:08.021 --> 00:26:08.060
<v Speaker 5>pieces because a lot of them were in </v>
<v Speaker 5>leather.</v>

588
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.100
<v Speaker 5>One of the ways they put together the </v>
<v Speaker 5>pieces,</v>

589
00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:15.101
<v Speaker 5>what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>genetic testing on them to find out </v>

590
00:26:15.101 --> 00:26:18.521
<v Speaker 5>which ones came from the same animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they knew that it was a piece of </v>

591
00:26:18.521 --> 00:26:20.000
<v Speaker 5>one's skin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Incredible stuff,</v>

592
00:26:20.001 --> 00:26:21.140
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>

593
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.200
<v Speaker 5>Amazing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was really incredible.</v>

594
00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:26.600
<v Speaker 5>And they're still putting that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing together,</v>

595
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are still trying to decipher it,</v>

596
00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.830
<v Speaker 5>which broadly over the last 2000 years.</v>

597
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:32.450
<v Speaker 5>And they found that banter over those </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

598
00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.820
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>500 years ago somebody would have looked</v>

599
00:26:34.821 --> 00:26:35.360
<v Speaker 5>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

600
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.150
<v Speaker 5>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

601
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.360
<v Speaker 5>maybe I can start a fire with it or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

602
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you're starving and you have to </v>

603
00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:44.680
<v Speaker 5>cook the book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

604
00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:44.680
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you cook the book,</v>

605
00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.560
<v Speaker 5>you know when you need something to </v>
<v Speaker 5>light a fire,</v>

606
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:48.300
<v Speaker 5>you're going to fuck that book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Light it on fire.</v>

607
00:26:48.301 --> 00:26:50.280
<v Speaker 5>We're going to die tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

608
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.850
<v Speaker 5>bicycling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

609
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:56.930
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much stuff was lost in the burning </v>

610
00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:58.130
<v Speaker 5>of the library of Alexandria,</v>
<v Speaker 5>south of disordered.</v>

611
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:03.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about thousands and </v>

612
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:03.140
<v Speaker 5>thousands of volumes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty damn scary.</v>

613
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing to think that human beings </v>

614
00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.411
<v Speaker 5>can be so fucking creative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then so destructive when people </v>

615
00:27:09.541 --> 00:27:14.541
<v Speaker 5>don't understand is there was some sort </v>
<v Speaker 5>of incredibly advanced society that was,</v>

616
00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.300
<v Speaker 5>that it created ancient Egypt.</v>

617
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:19.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to this day it's a.</v>

618
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:25.010
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of puzzles when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the immense construction,</v>

619
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:30.430
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fact that how much just actual mass </v>

620
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:31.800
<v Speaker 5>was moved the size of some of these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

621
00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:33.000
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>old ballistics.</v>

622
00:27:33.001 --> 00:27:36.030
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really is incredible society and they</v>

623
00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:41.031
<v Speaker 5>knew a lot of things and all of it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>wiped out in a fire.</v>

624
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:47.300
<v Speaker 5>And I think it was two fires.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there was two different times </v>

625
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:47.300
<v Speaker 5>they were attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

626
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:47.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm sort of like a man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

627
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.570
<v Speaker 5>how much further would we be if we knew </v>
<v Speaker 5>all that Shit,</v>

628
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:56.900
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's the same kind of stuff that </v>

629
00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:57.810
<v Speaker 5>happened even in other places because </v>
<v Speaker 5>when the Spaniards came over out here,</v>

630
00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:02.870
<v Speaker 5>when they conquered the aztecs and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Aztecs who are one of the indigenous </v>

631
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:06.111
<v Speaker 5>people that had big lied,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but our reason that books and written </v>

632
00:28:06.111 --> 00:28:07.110
<v Speaker 5>language and the whole thing and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Spanish approach was like,</v>

633
00:28:07.111 --> 00:28:09.650
<v Speaker 5>well there's these look like in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>volleyball.</v>

634
00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:10.360
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>while,</v>

635
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:11.370
<v Speaker 5>in decades.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna wait,</v>

636
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:14.120
<v Speaker 5>we can burn it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Burn it though.</v>

637
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.740
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's nice.</v>

638
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:19.360
<v Speaker 5>But so if it wasn't a Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just burned it bazzy.</v>

639
00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:24.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like your guys that are not </v>

640
00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:24.570
<v Speaker 5>curious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't see.</v>

641
00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:26.711
<v Speaker 5>It must be devil worshipers and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't burn evidence and you have </v>

642
00:28:26.711 --> 00:28:29.010
<v Speaker 5>ever done because it's all crap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did they burn and Maya and stuff?</v>

643
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:34.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean basically anything that was in </v>

644
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.270
<v Speaker 5>mines inklings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody you know there's still fine in </v>

645
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:37.350
<v Speaker 5>Mayan temples.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That fascinates me,</v>

646
00:28:37.351 --> 00:28:42.351
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They said that they might be as many as </v>

647
00:28:42.351 --> 00:28:43.350
<v Speaker 5>a thousand unfound temples in South </v>
<v Speaker 5>America.</v>

648
00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.480
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then again,</v>

649
00:28:45.481 --> 00:28:50.481
<v Speaker 5>when you hike through the jungle that </v>
<v Speaker 5>there are some tiny or you can see how </v>

650
00:28:50.481 --> 00:28:51.390
<v Speaker 5>that could be because you can't unsee </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

651
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:53.860
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Going to be 10 feet away and sold them a</v>

652
00:28:53.861 --> 00:28:55.830
<v Speaker 5>theme that you have no idea where they </v>
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>

653
00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:58.470
<v Speaker 5>Fucking incredible culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It existed here.</v>

654
00:28:58.471 --> 00:29:02.280
<v Speaker 5>What a bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 5>strange culture that made these,</v>

655
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:03.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

656
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:08.340
<v Speaker 5>these cities that were aligned to like </v>
<v Speaker 5>astronomical,</v>

657
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>points like really amazing,</v>

658
00:29:11.281 --> 00:29:14.610
<v Speaker 5>like he could look the way the sun would</v>
<v Speaker 5>come up through some doorways.</v>

659
00:29:14.611 --> 00:29:17.610
<v Speaker 5>It was like perfectly built.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's incredible.</v>

660
00:29:17.611 --> 00:29:19.530
<v Speaker 5>It's like the stuff that they had </v>
<v Speaker 5>figured out how to do.</v>

661
00:29:19.531 --> 00:29:21.300
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how did you do this?</v>

662
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.520
<v Speaker 5>This is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the pyramid,</v>

663
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.910
<v Speaker 5>the bottom of the pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a gigantic store and ahead of as</v>

664
00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.060
<v Speaker 5>snake and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the hell is the body?</v>

665
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.890
<v Speaker 5>It's like because of that one day of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>year when the standardize,</v>

666
00:29:32.891 --> 00:29:37.891
<v Speaker 5>this eats the shade of the steps in such</v>
<v Speaker 5>a way that it looks like the body's </v>

667
00:29:37.891 --> 00:29:38.550
<v Speaker 5>coming down here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like,</v>

668
00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:44.210
<v Speaker 5>can you imagine like building that whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing and then you have like shitty </v>

669
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.210
<v Speaker 5>weather</v>

670
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:47.680
<v Speaker 7>that would really suck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just the calculations involved.</v>

671
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:53.750
<v Speaker 7>I mean it is it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is it possible that some of them could </v>

672
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:54.090
<v Speaker 7>be coincidental?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess the snake thing could be.</v>

673
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.210
<v Speaker 7>It's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there's so many of them.</v>

674
00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:00.330
<v Speaker 7>There's one in the temple of Luxor.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it is,</v>

675
00:30:00.331 --> 00:30:05.331
<v Speaker 7>where the light comes down this corridor</v>
<v Speaker 7>and illuminates his whole room on one </v>

676
00:30:05.331 --> 00:30:05.790
<v Speaker 7>day of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

677
00:30:05.791 --> 00:30:10.791
<v Speaker 7>I mean these guys were awesome because </v>
<v Speaker 7>this incredible with the had figured </v>

678
00:30:11.071 --> 00:30:16.071
<v Speaker 7>out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They've figured out some amazing shit </v>

679
00:30:16.071 --> 00:30:17.931
<v Speaker 7>them in the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like so much stuff was lost in the </v>

680
00:30:17.931 --> 00:30:20.930
<v Speaker 7>past would have been so fascinating to </v>
<v Speaker 7>really know what it would.</v>

681
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:21.660
<v Speaker 7>What,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what?</v>

682
00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:26.690
<v Speaker 7>Like how much knowledge really was </v>
<v Speaker 7>around during the construction of the </v>

683
00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:26.890
<v Speaker 7>pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

684
00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:28.500
<v Speaker 7>what did they really know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>How much?</v>

685
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:33.830
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how much is lost in just the sand and </v>

686
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.220
<v Speaker 7>erosion and how much is gone and fire.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What the fuck did they really know?</v>

687
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:37.410
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>good.</v>

688
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:42.540
<v Speaker 5>Ninety nine percent of the human </v>
<v Speaker 5>population today with modern technology </v>

689
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:42.540
<v Speaker 5>and tell them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Build a pro.</v>

690
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.470
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of course.</v>

691
00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:44.930
<v Speaker 7>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

692
00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.770
<v Speaker 7>Everybody liked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Makes it like it's no big deal.</v>

693
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.420
<v Speaker 7>Canada here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>

694
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:52.470
<v Speaker 7>If you were asked by just a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 7>anywhere so it gets the top.</v>

695
00:30:52.471 --> 00:30:54.930
<v Speaker 7>It's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing.</v>

696
00:30:54.931 --> 00:30:59.931
<v Speaker 7>And they used to be covered in smooth </v>
<v Speaker 7>limestone to east to be shiny and then </v>

697
00:31:00.271 --> 00:31:03.180
<v Speaker 7>there was a gold cap on the top of them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>God Damn.</v>

698
00:31:03.181 --> 00:31:05.250
<v Speaker 7>That must've been magnificent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Theater Islam.</v>

699
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.130
<v Speaker 7>And what happened if people don't know </v>
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

700
00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.060
<v Speaker 7>look at the pyramids were they're so </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucked up.</v>

701
00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:11.850
<v Speaker 7>That's because people stole the </v>
<v Speaker 7>limestone.</v>

702
00:31:11.851 --> 00:31:16.110
<v Speaker 7>They chipped it off of those buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Those Gross,</v>

703
00:31:16.111 --> 00:31:21.111
<v Speaker 7>disgusting rat people chewed away at </v>
<v Speaker 7>that beautiful construction,</v>

704
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:27.110
<v Speaker 7>one of the most amazing things a human </v>
<v Speaker 7>being has ever created and they chewed </v>

705
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:31.311
<v Speaker 7>away it just pulling chunks of beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 7>stone off and building their shitty </v>

706
00:31:32.881 --> 00:31:36.180
<v Speaker 7>houses with it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fucking crooks,</v>

707
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.450
<v Speaker 7>rat people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you're in a good mood today.</v>

708
00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.990
<v Speaker 7>What kind of a human being would deface </v>
<v Speaker 7>the pyramid date?</v>

709
00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.360
<v Speaker 7>There were people that did that terrible</v>
<v Speaker 7>human beings.</v>

710
00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:46.680
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>could you imagine,</v>

711
00:31:46.681 --> 00:31:48.600
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what kind of a person would fucking chew</v>

712
00:31:48.601 --> 00:31:51.920
<v Speaker 7>up the Pyramids and steal the stone?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jesus Christ cookies,</v>

713
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.330
<v Speaker 7>your own limestone bench.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

714
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.180
<v Speaker 7>Can you make a house out of wood?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

715
00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.890
<v Speaker 7>Even the three pigs had options.</v>

716
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.660
<v Speaker 7>They knew some shit though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Huh?</v>

717
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:08.120
<v Speaker 7>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what kind of religions</v>

718
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:11.060
<v Speaker 5>around in ancient Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what did they worship?</v>

719
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:16.090
<v Speaker 5>It was all like hanging around that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or you see the transition from tribal </v>

720
00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:19.961
<v Speaker 5>religions that tend to be more mad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little flexible because they are not </v>

721
00:32:19.961 --> 00:32:20.480
<v Speaker 5>written down is relatively small </v>
<v Speaker 5>society.</v>

722
00:32:20.481 --> 00:32:22.600
<v Speaker 5>So there's a lot more flexibility about </v>
<v Speaker 5>the beliefs.</v>

723
00:32:22.601 --> 00:32:25.280
<v Speaker 5>So there are generally mystic </v>
<v Speaker 5>shamanistic kind of beliefs,</v>

724
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:27.590
<v Speaker 5>but then when you turned them into a big</v>
<v Speaker 5>society,</v>

725
00:32:27.591 --> 00:32:30.140
<v Speaker 5>we like millions of people living in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They become,</v>

726
00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:32.450
<v Speaker 5>you still have a lot of these traces of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that stuff.</v>

727
00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:34.010
<v Speaker 5>It's all about spirits and these and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

728
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:36.800
<v Speaker 5>but then they become much more hoodie </v>
<v Speaker 5>juvenile fish.</v>

729
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:41.090
<v Speaker 5>Ow there's a clergy leaders if it comes </v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's the and you know.</v>

730
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:46.150
<v Speaker 5>So it's kind of a more structured type </v>
<v Speaker 5>of funny museum that in my mind kind of </v>

731
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:50.040
<v Speaker 5>pretty much hitting mean whatever his </v>
<v Speaker 5>mood about only museum to begin with.</v>

732
00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:53.830
<v Speaker 5>You tweeted a Robert e Dot Howard quote </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other day.</v>

733
00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.180
<v Speaker 5>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I was a huge.</v>

736
00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.630
<v Speaker 5>What was the exact tweet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a Conan quote,</v>

737
00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:02.490
<v Speaker 5>unquote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget what the hell it is,</v>

738
00:33:02.491 --> 00:33:04.520
<v Speaker 5>but it's basically cannon going off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>their lies.</v>

740
00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.360
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was um,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I forget which book,</v>

743
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.310
<v Speaker 7>but it's a famous quote.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Where the fuck is it?</v>

744
00:33:17.311 --> 00:33:19.500
<v Speaker 7>I live,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I burned with life.</v>

745
00:33:19.501 --> 00:33:22.650

<v Speaker 5>It was all these crazy fantasy books.</v>

00:33:47.211 --> 00:33:51.140
<v Speaker 5>They're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're fucking really fun to read.</v>

753
00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:52.370
<v Speaker 5>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

754
00:33:52.371 --> 00:33:56.480
<v Speaker 5>I became hooked on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the Conan novels and he was,</v>

755
00:33:56.481 --> 00:33:57.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>a really nutty dude and wound up taking </v>
<v Speaker 5>his own life.</v>

757
00:34:00.801 --> 00:34:02.510
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he's throwing out by the</v>

758
00:34:02.511 --> 00:34:06.320
<v Speaker 5>legend has it that he would say that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>at night.</v>

759
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.400
<v Speaker 5>He would see these as he would have got </v>
<v Speaker 5>derrick to it,</v>

760
00:34:08.401 --> 00:34:13.401
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And suddenly he would see the shadow </v>

761
00:34:13.401 --> 00:34:14.810
<v Speaker 5>behind him and he wouldn't turn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he cooked out that he was calling on</v>

762
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.180
<v Speaker 5>Kevin and John Tax ready to shop.</v>

<v Speaker 5>all told night.</v>

764
00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.500
<v Speaker 5>And he would stay there and like sweat </v>
<v Speaker 5>that right there.</v>

765
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:26.510
<v Speaker 5>Right in the morning he was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he could finally sleep because I know</v>

766
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.320
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't be back ready to shop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

767
00:34:30.321 --> 00:34:35.321
<v Speaker 5>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the coolest fucking character </v>

768
00:34:35.321 --> 00:34:38.120
<v Speaker 5>in any book ever written down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

769
00:34:38.121 --> 00:34:40.600
<v Speaker 5>the people like Conan the barbarian with</v>
<v Speaker 5>Arnold Schwartzenegger.</v>

770
00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:42.140
<v Speaker 5>That was pretty cool and everything like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

771
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.510
<v Speaker 5>But really the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the real.</v>

772
00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:49.660
<v Speaker 5>If someone got ever figured out how to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do the book justice and make it really </v>

773
00:34:49.671 --> 00:34:50.720
<v Speaker 5>put it together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

774
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.720
<v Speaker 5>Like the last one was Kinda corny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The dude was pretty bad ass.</v>

775
00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.410
<v Speaker 5>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That dude was a good call,</v>

776
00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:55.890
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

777
00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:59.450

<v Speaker 5>should look like now look great.</v>

778
00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.910

<v Speaker 5>writing was bad,</v>

779
00:35:01.911 --> 00:35:04.070
<v Speaker 5>but he was good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His fight scenes were great.</v>

780
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:05.750
<v Speaker 5>He looked like Conan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

781

<v Speaker 5>I think he people were hating because </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's too fucking good looking.</v>

782
00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:14.080
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The dude is just way too good luck and </v>

796
00:35:40.081 --> 00:35:42.870
<v Speaker 7>Horses spinning around everybody you </v>
<v Speaker 7>know who would do it right?</v>

<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

799
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:53.450
<v Speaker 7>He would dig into that bitch and if you </v>
<v Speaker 7>can get Quintin Tarantino to direct the </v>

800
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.060
<v Speaker 7>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>God Damn Son.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Get him to write it to get him to write </v>

803

<v Speaker 5>one of the better books.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so many good books too.</v>

805
00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:10.450
<v Speaker 5>I gotta give you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Having Tarantino would be a freaking </v>

806
00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:10.450
<v Speaker 5>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I like,</v>

807
00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:12.240
<v Speaker 5>I have to say I liked the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the original Canon.</v>

808
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:15.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I find it interesting that,</v>

809
00:36:15.281 --> 00:36:18.590
<v Speaker 5>that he's the same guy will come up with</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the concepts were UFC,</v>

810
00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our old gracie said,</v>

811
00:36:20.571 --> 00:36:25.571
<v Speaker 5>but all over it because he wasn't one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>their students of the students off the </v>

812
00:36:25.571 --> 00:36:29.570
<v Speaker 5>graces and he was the gracies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had the art Davey and they were </v>

813
00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:34.120
<v Speaker 5>immediately as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as kind of a creative director or into </v>

814
00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.601
<v Speaker 5>the first UFC started coming up with </v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the ideas that then somebody </v>

815
00:36:37.601 --> 00:36:38.420
<v Speaker 5>else designed for the arc that go on and</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of that.</v>

816
00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.580
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love that guy.</v>

817
00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.700
<v Speaker 5>He created Conan the barbarian and was </v>
<v Speaker 5>at the beginning of USC.</v>

818
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.310
<v Speaker 5>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even know that.</v>

819
00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:51.340
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have some UFC trivia that I didn't </v>

820
00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:51.950
<v Speaker 5>even know that I can go home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Satisfied now I'm,</v>

821
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:55.160
<v Speaker 5>my work is done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rampage Jackson is mad at me.</v>

822
00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:57.810
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know is an interview.</v>

823
00:36:58.330 --> 00:36:58.730
<v Speaker 5>Read it.</v>

824
00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.370
<v Speaker 7>I was watching.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was just call me fake ass.</v>

825
00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:04.290
<v Speaker 7>And he was saying that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Really?</v>

826
00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:06.390
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was saying that all I want them to do</v>

827
00:37:06.391 --> 00:37:11.391
<v Speaker 7>is throw low kicks and reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't throw low kicks is because </v>

828
00:37:11.391 --> 00:37:12.330
<v Speaker 7>he's fighting a wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You dumb asses.</v>

829
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.230
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

830
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.880
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't.</v>

831
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:19.970
<v Speaker 7>I'd love rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't mean to be rude when I assess </v>

832
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:21.280
<v Speaker 7>things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm just trying to objectives.</v>

833
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:25.320
<v Speaker 7>Really try to figure out how this guy </v>
<v Speaker 7>could be doing better than he's doing.</v>

834
00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:27.930
<v Speaker 7>When I look at a guy like rampage,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I look at a dude with.</v>

835
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:29.790
<v Speaker 7>He's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>first of all,</v>

836
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.370
<v Speaker 7>one of the most exciting fighters of all</v>
<v Speaker 7>time.</v>

837
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.180
<v Speaker 7>You go back to his fights and pride like</v>
<v Speaker 7>the Ricardo Arona fight or the or the,</v>

838
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:38.520
<v Speaker 7>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kevin randleman knockout.</v>

839
00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:39.570
<v Speaker 7>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Random and knockout.</v>

840
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:43.200
<v Speaker 7>God damn the slam on a roll.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I meet so many.</v>

841
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:46.260
<v Speaker 7>He had a great,</v>
<v Speaker 7>great fucking fights in pride.</v>

842
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.500
<v Speaker 7>Know rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I liked him a lot.</v>

843
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:52.130
<v Speaker 7>I like him as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I enjoyed hanging out with them.</v>

844
00:37:52.131 --> 00:37:54.570
<v Speaker 7>I did a thing with him for the UFC once </v>
<v Speaker 7>it was,</v>

845
00:37:54.571 --> 00:37:56.640
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was a show that we did,</v>

846
00:37:56.790 --> 00:38:01.790
<v Speaker 7>I think it was called ultimately.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Was it ufc ultimate inside or something </v>

847
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:02.700
<v Speaker 7>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that the one we're doing now?</v>

848
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.070
<v Speaker 7>I don't even remember the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was,</v>

849
00:38:05.071 --> 00:38:07.410
<v Speaker 7>it was on spike.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh fuck.</v>

850
00:38:07.411 --> 00:38:08.810
<v Speaker 7>What was the name of it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

851
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:13.350
<v Speaker 7>UFC unleashed is Michael Goldberg's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What the hell is it called?</v>

852
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.830
<v Speaker 7>Any idea right now?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Alright,</v>

853
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.960
<v Speaker 7>what time at UFC?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whatever it was.</v>

854
00:38:18.961 --> 00:38:20.670
<v Speaker 7>I don't remember what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

855
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:21.600
<v Speaker 7>we,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

856
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:25.530
<v Speaker 7>we drove around in his tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He has this giant monster truck with his</v>

857
00:38:25.531 --> 00:38:28.170
<v Speaker 7>face on the side of it and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's fucking awesome.</v>

858
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:29.790
<v Speaker 7>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's all lifted and shit.</v>

859
00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.270
<v Speaker 7>And we drove around and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I even trained with them.</v>

860
00:38:33.271 --> 00:38:35.350
<v Speaker 7>We went to the gym and trained and we </v>
<v Speaker 7>filmed everything.</v>

861
00:38:35.351 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 7>We went and got chicken</v>

862
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.670
<v Speaker 1>together and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went to popeyes.</v>

863
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:41.740
<v Speaker 1>He's cool as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like them.</v>

864
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean anything when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm trying to,</v>

865
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.110
<v Speaker 1>like when I'm judging a fight or what </v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

866
00:38:47.111 --> 00:38:48.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not judging a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm,</v>

867
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:53.430
<v Speaker 1>when I'm doing commentary and a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I'm trying to do is sort of </v>

868
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:55.660
<v Speaker 1>objective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really assess what I think someone could</v>

869
00:38:55.690 --> 00:39:00.690
<v Speaker 1>be doing differently to try to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves out of a spot if they're not </v>

870
00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:01.990
<v Speaker 1>winning or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to commentate.</v>

871
00:39:01.991 --> 00:39:05.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like critiquing the guy soul,</v>

872
00:39:05.531 --> 00:39:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like breaking down who he is as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a person.</v>

873
00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I liked the guy a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even ran pitching himself admits </v>

874
00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:14.050
<v Speaker 1>that he was more exciting back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day when he was in.</v>

875
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to be.</v>

876
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:18.100
<v Speaker 1>He's a great fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do whatever the fuck he wants.</v>

877
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:21.130
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm doing what I'm doing.</v>

878
00:39:21.131 --> 00:39:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Commentary is just my objective opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>

879
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:28.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I don't like the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think he stopped?</v>

880
00:39:28.511 --> 00:39:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Because even prior to pretty much every </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight he would picked somebody up,</v>

881
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.060
<v Speaker 1>leave them up in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slammed.</v>

882
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know he needed every fight?</v>

883
00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.030
<v Speaker 1>No facade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then never again.</v>

884
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell happened?</v>

885
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:43.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he has a lot more tools now.</v>

886
00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:44.980
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

887
00:39:44.981 --> 00:39:46.100
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to tell him.</v>

888
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Also he was finding people in a ring </v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

889
00:39:48.791 --> 00:39:51.730
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing can actually be easier to pick</v>

890
00:39:51.731 --> 00:39:55.410
<v Speaker 1>people up in the cage because they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>age would.</v>

891
00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Well He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

892
00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:59.500
<v Speaker 1>it also you could get fucking after </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that for a long time.</v>

893
00:39:59.501 --> 00:40:02.920
<v Speaker 1>You could get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible you could hurt your back,</v>

894
00:40:02.921 --> 00:40:06.400
<v Speaker 1>you could have like issues like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers of really powerful guys.</v>

895
00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just guessing.</v>

896
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:11.460
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of guys eventually have like </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinks in their neck and shit.</v>

897
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Tito's had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a disc replacement and data wasn't even </v>

898
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:16.910
<v Speaker 1>lifting people up was just shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>

899
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.880
<v Speaker 1>lifted some people up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knocked out Evan Tanner,</v>

900
00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:25.140
<v Speaker 1>that was with a big body slam and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was younger he would hold these guys </v>

901
00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:25.140
<v Speaker 1>up a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

902
00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I think as you get older you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter.</v>

903
00:40:26.711 --> 00:40:28.750
<v Speaker 1>As you get smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fight more conservatively.</v>

904
00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

905
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.180
<v Speaker 1>but I just wish the guy wasn't mad at me</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I tell them to throw leg kicks,</v>

906
00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:35.740
<v Speaker 1>it's just because he has awesome leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicks.</v>

907
00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>

908
00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

909
00:40:37.241 --> 00:40:38.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fighting a wrestler.</v>

910
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Dumb ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know,</v>

911
00:40:39.221 --> 00:40:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm Dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying man,</v>

912
00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.690
<v Speaker 1>he landed a few and his leg kicks are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking bad ass.</v>

913
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see that if I was in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>corner,</v>

914
00:40:46.091 --> 00:40:46.540
<v Speaker 1>you know</v>

915
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:52.170
<v Speaker 2>when rampage is mad at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that something that you should be </v>

916
00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.571
<v Speaker 2>worried about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're out and you see them </v>

917
00:40:54.571 --> 00:40:54.571
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

918
00:40:54.571 --> 00:40:55.230
<v Speaker 2>I would talk to him and I'd take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd be cool instantly.</v>

919
00:40:55.500 --> 00:41:00.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a bad person and he's not a bad </v>

920
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:00.500
<v Speaker 1>person either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

921
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.710
<v Speaker 1>he's just upset and he's sensitive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's also got the toughest fucking job </v>

922
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:07.251
<v Speaker 1>on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of pressure and a lot of </v>

923
00:41:07.251 --> 00:41:07.251
<v Speaker 1>stress involved in being a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

924
00:41:07.251 --> 00:41:11.220
<v Speaker 1>And the last thing I want to do is add </v>
<v Speaker 1>more pressure and add more stress.</v>

925
00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:14.460
<v Speaker 1>All I'm doing is trying to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>analyzing the fight.</v>

926
00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.530
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just I have to be objective.</v>

927
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't protect someone's feelings,</v>

928
00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:24.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the expense of doing what I'm </v>

929
00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.081
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of analyzing what's going </v>

930
00:41:27.081 --> 00:41:27.081
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

931
00:41:27.081 --> 00:41:28.920
<v Speaker 1>And some people say I'm biased and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was standing a bias towards Jujitsu guys</v>

932
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.010
<v Speaker 1>because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your lego second deck.</v>

933
00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.120
<v Speaker 1>That was cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was funny.</v>

934
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

935
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.030
<v Speaker 7>was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was good.</v>

936
00:41:35.031 --> 00:41:36.850
<v Speaker 7>He was animated and Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

937
00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.390
<v Speaker 7>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's a funny guy,</v>

938
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:39.950
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I like rampage.</v>

939
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:45.250
<v Speaker 7>But if anything I'm more biased.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I always say towards like really </v>

940
00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:49.001
<v Speaker 7>aggressive strikers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like vendelay Silva is my favorite all </v>

941
00:41:49.001 --> 00:41:49.001
<v Speaker 7>time fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Rarely.</v>

942
00:41:49.001 --> 00:41:49.001
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think so.</v>

943
00:41:49.001 --> 00:41:51.500
<v Speaker 7>If I had to pick like one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the vandelay and pride,</v>

944
00:41:51.501 --> 00:41:55.640
<v Speaker 7>he because he was so wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just every vandelay Silva fight,</v>

945
00:41:55.641 --> 00:41:57.370
<v Speaker 7>you know exactly what the fuck you were </v>
<v Speaker 7>getting into.</v>

946
00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:00.110
<v Speaker 7>It was like a Tyson fight and then that </v>
<v Speaker 7>same sort of feeling.</v>

947
00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:00.770
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

948
00:42:00.771 --> 00:42:02.450
<v Speaker 7>when he was on top,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

949
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:07.510
<v Speaker 7>when,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when vandelay was just smashed and </v>

950
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.510
<v Speaker 7>dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when he was at his like,</v>

951
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:09.260
<v Speaker 7>he's very peak.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was so wild.</v>

952
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:11.010
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a wild guy to look.</v>

953
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:14.210
<v Speaker 7>There was an excitement as a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like holy shit.</v>

954
00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.720
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean with vandelay was </v>
<v Speaker 7>gonna fight man.</v>

955
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:20.060
<v Speaker 7>Everybody would get hyped up and still </v>
<v Speaker 7>to this day,</v>

956
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:23.750
<v Speaker 7>like that commonly fight proved it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Still to this day he's got that,</v>

957
00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:28.900
<v Speaker 7>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So my all time favorite style of </v>

958
00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.500
<v Speaker 7>fighting is really not Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

959
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:31.340
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

960
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.370
<v Speaker 7>I liked strikers to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I like to,</v>

961
00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:37.280
<v Speaker 7>I still like watching beautiful Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 7>technique.</v>

962
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:42.430
<v Speaker 7>I absolutely do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But for the Oh shit moments for the Oh </v>

963
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:43.900
<v Speaker 7>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like almost always chaos.</v>

964
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:46.850
<v Speaker 7>It's almost hit its head kicks and Mirko</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cro.</v>

965
00:42:46.851 --> 00:42:48.980
<v Speaker 7>Cop was like the king of the Oh shit </v>
<v Speaker 7>moment.</v>

966
00:42:48.981 --> 00:42:50.150
<v Speaker 7>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

967
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.460
<v Speaker 7>his,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his left high kicks and Fan Angela,</v>

968
00:42:52.461 --> 00:42:57.461
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>those are the guys that I always like </v>

969
00:42:57.461 --> 00:42:57.740
<v Speaker 7>really enjoy watching maybe the most,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if anything,</v>

970
00:42:57.741 --> 00:43:00.340
<v Speaker 7>I'm biased towards those guys but I </v>
<v Speaker 7>just,</v>

971
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I appreciate all of it man.</v>

972
00:43:02.721 --> 00:43:07.721
<v Speaker 7>I appreciate wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think wrestling is one of the most </v>

973
00:43:07.721 --> 00:43:10.811
<v Speaker 7>important aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I always show that that's the biggest </v>

974
00:43:10.811 --> 00:43:10.811
<v Speaker 7>base of the pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

975
00:43:10.811 --> 00:43:11.870
<v Speaker 7>and I was never really a wrestler.</v>

976
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:13.940
<v Speaker 7>I wrestled for one year in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

977
00:43:13.941 --> 00:43:18.941
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't have a bias when I'm looking at </v>

978
00:43:18.941 --> 00:43:20.981
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm really trying to look at it as </v>

979
00:43:20.981 --> 00:43:22.310
<v Speaker 7>objectively as possible and it changes </v>
<v Speaker 7>all the time or what's important.</v>

980
00:43:22.311 --> 00:43:27.311
<v Speaker 7>It changes all the time because </v>
<v Speaker 7>different levels of guys will enter the </v>

981
00:43:27.311 --> 00:43:28.280
<v Speaker 7>game and that's when things gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like gets things get weird,</v>

982
00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:33.281
<v Speaker 7>like when you get like a really high </v>
<v Speaker 7>level striker that all of a sudden </v>

983
00:43:33.281 --> 00:43:34.580
<v Speaker 7>learns how to sprawl and is really good </v>
<v Speaker 7>at wrestling.</v>

984
00:43:34.581 --> 00:43:37.310
<v Speaker 7>Maybe we wrestled a little bit in high </v>
<v Speaker 7>school and then all sudden boom,</v>

985
00:43:37.311 --> 00:43:39.110
<v Speaker 7>he's in the UFC and you got to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 7>this.</v>

986
00:43:39.111 --> 00:43:40.130
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

987
00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:45.650
<v Speaker 7>you get to like a really high level </v>
<v Speaker 7>professional Moitai type fighters who </v>

988
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:48.290
<v Speaker 7>have really crisp striking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If one of those guys,</v>

989
00:43:48.291 --> 00:43:53.291
<v Speaker 7>one of those really top end guys,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but one of those are Nesto who slept in </v>

990
00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:53.291
<v Speaker 7>his prime.</v>

991
00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:57.790
<v Speaker 7>One of those guys stepped into the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everything changes in that division and </v>

992
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.950
<v Speaker 7>then everybody has to figure that guy </v>
<v Speaker 7>out.</v>

993
00:43:57.951 --> 00:43:58.960
<v Speaker 7>Now you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

994
00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:01.160
<v Speaker 7>everyone has to either evolve around his</v>
<v Speaker 7>skills,</v>

995
00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.380
<v Speaker 7>find a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to be able to stand with him.</v>

996
00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:07.010
<v Speaker 7>I hope he gets beat up in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

997
00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:10.050
<v Speaker 7>shooting before the man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's such a,</v>

998
00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.890
<v Speaker 7>it's constantly changing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What's important,</v>

999
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:17.920
<v Speaker 7>what's important is constantly changing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Where are we seeing like a new version </v>

1000
00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:17.920
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1001
00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.221
<v Speaker 7>and then what if,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what if one of these guys show site and </v>

1002
00:44:21.221 --> 00:44:21.221
<v Speaker 7>then all of a sudden you got this Jon </v>
<v Speaker 7>Jones version,</v>

1003
00:44:21.221 --> 00:44:23.690
<v Speaker 7>this new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how do you fucking deal with this?</v>

1004
00:44:23.691 --> 00:44:26.960
<v Speaker 7>You've got some young kid who's really </v>
<v Speaker 7>confident,</v>

1005
00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:30.590
<v Speaker 7>very smart and has unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 7>strength,</v>

1006
00:44:30.591 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 7>comes from a background</v>

1007
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.900
<v Speaker 1>and has the longest reach of any fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being on the face of the planet is</v>

1008
00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:40.930
<v Speaker 1>blasting you and you can even get close </v>
<v Speaker 1>to him and he's getting better every </v>

1009
00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:40.930
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every,</v>

1010
00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:41.580
<v Speaker 1>every time he blinks he's getting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit better.</v>

1011
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:42.840
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

1012
00:44:42.841 --> 00:44:47.841
<v Speaker 1>And also he's creative because there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of guys today that are awesome </v>

1013
00:44:47.841 --> 00:44:47.841
<v Speaker 1>athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're great fighters,</v>

1014
00:44:47.841 --> 00:44:50.640
<v Speaker 1>but they are kind of boring to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they do what everybody else does</v>

1015
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:51.300
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1016
00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:56.360
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like all the respect in the world </v>

1017
00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:56.360
<v Speaker 1>because they are doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing,</v>

1018
00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.901
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that you'd watch somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Jen Jones so you would watch </v>

1019
00:44:59.901 --> 00:45:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CEO of some of these guys.</v>

1020
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:05.300
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a master at work and you sit back </v>

1021
00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:05.300
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

1022
00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:05.300
<v Speaker 1>what is going to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1023
00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.440
<v Speaker 1>he's an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why it's called martial</v>

1024
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:07.770
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>

1025
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Martial artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1026
00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:12.660
<v Speaker 1>That is exactly what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's artwork,</v>

1027
00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you watch his shogun fight,</v>

1028
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.390
<v Speaker 1>watch the John Jones shogun fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's not like a symphony,</v>

1029
00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:21.780
<v Speaker 1>it's like a beautiful work of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what he did is he.</v>

1030
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:27.050
<v Speaker 1>He destroyed one of the best fighters on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet and he made it look easy and </v>

1031
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:28.830
<v Speaker 1>it puts it in perspective because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1032
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:31.660
<v Speaker 1>fucking Leonardo didn't have some six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four do it,</v>

1033
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.440
<v Speaker 1>trying to punch him in the face while he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was painting his masterpiece.</v>

1034
00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely believe if you watch the John</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones Leo Machida fight that that is a </v>

1035
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:44.391
<v Speaker 1>work of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely believe that that's </v>

1036
00:45:44.391 --> 00:45:44.490
<v Speaker 1>artwork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

1037
00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:47.640
<v Speaker 1>The finish was so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything about it,</v>

1038
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.500
<v Speaker 1>everything about the fight is </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>

1039
00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.810
<v Speaker 1>The fact that the yellow tagged him a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few times,</v>

1040
00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Liotta look great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he just,</v>

1041
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:55.260
<v Speaker 1>he caught Leo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

1042
00:45:55.261 --> 00:45:56.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the ground of days.</v>

1043
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the ground and caught him in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing gear,</v>

1044
00:45:58.001 --> 00:46:03.001
<v Speaker 1>Tina God damn woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you put it all together like as far </v>

1045
00:46:03.001 --> 00:46:04.470
<v Speaker 1>as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome entertainment impact.</v>

1046
00:46:04.471 --> 00:46:06.780
<v Speaker 1>You cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a work of art,</v>

1047
00:46:06.781 --> 00:46:09.690
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely is a different type of art.</v>

1048
00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:15.020
<v Speaker 1>I like watching some time somebody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire career kind of radar than </v>

1049
00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:15.400
<v Speaker 1>watching a bunch of fights from </v>
<v Speaker 1>different people.</v>

1050
00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Like watch one guy and watch back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>back finds of their stuff and you see </v>

1051
00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:20.970
<v Speaker 1>the evolution of their style and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really see a style.</v>

1052
00:46:20.971 --> 00:46:22.500
<v Speaker 1>They're at work and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome.</v>

1053
00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a fascinating thing to watch </v>

1054
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:27.890
<v Speaker 1>guys evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1055
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I remember Anderson Silva's first couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fights when he first started fighting</v>

1056
00:46:30.511 --> 00:46:35.511
<v Speaker 1>in pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was primarily a standup guy and he </v>

1057
00:46:35.511 --> 00:46:35.511
<v Speaker 1>had submitted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he went to the ground,</v>

1058
00:46:35.511 --> 00:46:36.870
<v Speaker 1>like Takahashi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>

1059
00:46:36.871 --> 00:46:39.480
<v Speaker 1>got him in a mounted triangle and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1060
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.080
<v Speaker 1>with wrestling shoes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he did was hit Takahashi.</v>

1061
00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Now somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1062
00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:47.190
<v Speaker 1>some dude who had a losing record of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things,</v>

1063
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:47.990
<v Speaker 1>the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

1064
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.760
<v Speaker 1>No thinking about shown it before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1065
00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:54.760
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1066
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:59.960
<v Speaker 1>he's the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll meet Carlos Newton by decision </v>

1067
00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:00.390
<v Speaker 1>and in one of the Bushido events that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it.</v>

1068
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:01.990
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's awesome.</v>

1070
00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he mounted them and guide them in</v>

1071
00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:07.100
<v Speaker 1>a triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Rio.</v>

1072
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Joanne got him in that flurry flying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll book.</v>

1073
00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:16.340
<v Speaker 1>You never seen Anderson Silva lost in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most spectacular finishes of </v>

1074
00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.700
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get any better than that.</v>

1075
00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I'd be stewed Rio shown and fluid him </v>
<v Speaker 1>sideways,</v>

1076
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:25.880
<v Speaker 1>tied his legs up together in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scissors like a movie that's like some </v>

1077
00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.320
<v Speaker 1>shit from a movie that's like some shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a pro wrestling show.</v>

1078
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 1>And then caught him in this</v>

1079
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.410
<v Speaker 7>flying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He'll hook and Anderson like immediately</v>

1080
00:47:32.411 --> 00:47:35.230
<v Speaker 7>tapped in screaming in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1081
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.480
<v Speaker 7>that's really the best submission I've </v>
<v Speaker 7>ever seen.</v>

1082
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.940
<v Speaker 7>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And there's anything that craziness.</v>

1083
00:47:39.941 --> 00:47:44.941
<v Speaker 7>And on top of it I apparently Anderson's</v>
<v Speaker 7>foot was fucked up when it was going </v>

1084
00:47:44.941 --> 00:47:46.620
<v Speaker 7>into that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It looked like the second he touches him</v>

1085
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:49.060
<v Speaker 7>and is already tapping and screaming and</v>
<v Speaker 7>going crazy.</v>

1086
00:47:49.061 --> 00:47:49.650
<v Speaker 7>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1087
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.670
<v Speaker 7>He went into that fight with a fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 7>foot.</v>

1088
00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.490
<v Speaker 7>That's why he wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He wasn't moving so well.</v>

1089
00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:55.540
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what it looked like.</v>

1090
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.230
<v Speaker 7>So that guy goes from that and then all </v>
<v Speaker 7>of a sudden he fights in the UFC against</v>

1091
00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:02.400
<v Speaker 7>Chris Leben and now you see this master,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1092
00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:03.370
<v Speaker 7>you see like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wow,</v>

1093
00:48:03.371 --> 00:48:06.880
<v Speaker 7>like the way he took leaving a part like</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is a master,</v>

1094
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:12.390
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the way he moved when he liked </v>

1095
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.580
<v Speaker 7>everything leaving through,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's like shocked out of the way,</v>

1096
00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.410
<v Speaker 7>encountered Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Bam,</v>

1097
00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:14.800
<v Speaker 7>Bam.</v>

1098
00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:20.010
<v Speaker 7>These just precise counters and lievens </v>
<v Speaker 7>charging forward and he's blasting them </v>

1099
00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:21.760
<v Speaker 7>with kicks and knees and punches and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

1100
00:48:21.761 --> 00:48:25.120
<v Speaker 7>God damn is he good?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Holy Shit.</v>

1101
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.960
<v Speaker 7>His fight for as good a fiend.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean I do.</v>

1102
00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:29.770
<v Speaker 7>What the hell can you say?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1103
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:30.380
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1104
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:32.260
<v Speaker 7>one of the interesting thing is that </v>
<v Speaker 7>forest,</v>

1105
00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:37.410
<v Speaker 7>I had an interview with him about that </v>
<v Speaker 7>and he told me that he had gotten </v>

1106
00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:37.960
<v Speaker 7>knocked out twice in training camp </v>
<v Speaker 7>before that fighting.</v>

1107
00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:43.320
<v Speaker 7>So right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right away he probably shouldn't have </v>

1108
00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:43.320
<v Speaker 7>even been in it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1109
00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:43.450
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1110
00:48:43.451 --> 00:48:48.451
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you get knocked down in a training </v>

1111
00:48:48.451 --> 00:48:50.581
<v Speaker 7>camp like two times,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how many concussions are you allowed to </v>

1112
00:48:50.581 --> 00:48:50.800
<v Speaker 7>have like really close back to back,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1113
00:48:50.801 --> 00:48:55.801
<v Speaker 7>That already are disclosed to somebody </v>
<v Speaker 7>touching you the right away and you're </v>

1114
00:48:55.801 --> 00:48:55.801
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1115
00:48:55.801 --> 00:48:59.761
<v Speaker 7>there's been a few fighters that have </v>
<v Speaker 7>had that happen to them and they both </v>

1116
00:48:59.761 --> 00:48:59.761
<v Speaker 7>got knocked out exactly the same way.</v>

1117
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:03.040
<v Speaker 7>One of them was a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was a dude who was fighting in the</v>

1118
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.180
<v Speaker 7>UFC for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1119
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:11.030
<v Speaker 7>fuck was Marvin Eastman.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Marvin Eastman got knocked out.</v>

1120
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:15.480
<v Speaker 7>He was a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He got caught by Travis.</v>

1121
00:49:15.481 --> 00:49:17.650
<v Speaker 7>What the fuck's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Luther Travis Luder.</v>

1122
00:49:17.651 --> 00:49:18.580
<v Speaker 7>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jesus Christ.</v>

1123
00:49:18.581 --> 00:49:20.780
<v Speaker 7>How can I forget that guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who's sick?</v>

1124
00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:25.890
<v Speaker 7>Jujitsu guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but not really known for being like a </v>

1125
00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:26.390
<v Speaker 7>super powerful striker,</v>
<v Speaker 7>real strong guy.</v>

1126
00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:27.850
<v Speaker 7>I can't believe I forgot his name.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Travis.</v>

1127
00:49:27.851 --> 00:49:29.620
<v Speaker 7>I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love that guy.</v>

1128
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:31.180
<v Speaker 7>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just had too much weight.</v>

1129
00:49:31.181 --> 00:49:36.181
<v Speaker 7>Do I blame it on the weed?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's way too much weight and really </v>

1130
00:49:36.181 --> 00:49:40.231
<v Speaker 7>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've been sitting here stone like a </v>

1131
00:49:40.231 --> 00:49:40.231
<v Speaker 7>crazy person over here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:49:40.231 --> 00:49:41.710
<v Speaker 7>It's not good for your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Stuff's terrible for him.</v>

1133
00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:46.920
<v Speaker 7>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Travis Luder caught Marvin eastern with </v>

1134
00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.841
<v Speaker 7>a right hand and just like at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 7>the punch and eastern went down like he </v>

1135
00:49:48.841 --> 00:49:49.730
<v Speaker 7>got shot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he got snipe from a,</v>

1136
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.190
<v Speaker 7>from a fucking tower.</v>

1137
00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:56.640
<v Speaker 7>It was a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He had gotten knocked out twice in </v>

1138
00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:56.830
<v Speaker 7>training camp as well by a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was a knockdown once,</v>

1139
00:49:56.831 --> 00:50:01.831
<v Speaker 7>I think by Tito Ortiz accidentally ran </v>
<v Speaker 7>into a knee and knocked down another </v>

1140
00:50:01.831 --> 00:50:04.690
<v Speaker 7>time when I take down attempt so you </v>
<v Speaker 7>know when that's happening,</v>

1141
00:50:04.691 --> 00:50:05.180
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

1142
00:50:05.181 --> 00:50:07.150
<v Speaker 7>you know you can get knocked out super </v>
<v Speaker 7>easy.</v>

1143
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:08.980
<v Speaker 7>It's big enough.</v>
<v Speaker 7>MMA and religion.</v>

1144
00:50:08.981 --> 00:50:13.981
<v Speaker 7>That was one of my favorite moments ever</v>
<v Speaker 7>when a eastern mountain lost a fight to </v>

1145
00:50:13.981 --> 00:50:18.090
<v Speaker 7>vitor belfort,</v>
<v Speaker 7>did that crazy knee and sprite and then </v>

1146
00:50:18.431 --> 00:50:23.431
<v Speaker 7>they added the cameras in the post fight</v>
<v Speaker 7>interview on Belford saying thank you </v>

1147
00:50:23.431 --> 00:50:25.330
<v Speaker 7>Jesus for giving me the strength to do </v>
<v Speaker 7>what I do.</v>

1148
00:50:25.331 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 7>And then they pan on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Marvin eastern phases like you</v>

1149
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.300
<v Speaker 5>sold that is pretty top one looks at a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you said,</v>

1150
00:50:32.301 --> 00:50:34.370
<v Speaker 5>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you said he looked like a good spot,</v>

1151
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:37.250
<v Speaker 5>Diana,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which has the best line server,</v>

1152
00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:42.280
<v Speaker 5>but it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really unfortunate that I actually saw </v>

1153
00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.520
<v Speaker 5>that it just kept it to myself and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>see Belfort going out about Jesus giving</v>

1154
00:50:45.901 --> 00:50:49.670
<v Speaker 5>him the strength that you see somebody </v>
<v Speaker 5>had been plead with blood everywhere and</v>

1155
00:50:49.671 --> 00:50:50.810
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really?</v>

1156
00:50:50.811 --> 00:50:54.200
<v Speaker 5>That's what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I thought that was pretty funny,</v>

1157
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:59.290
<v Speaker 5>but that'd be a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think a lot of fighters really,</v>

1158
00:51:00.171 --> 00:51:05.171
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>liked to believe in the Lord and like </v>

1159
00:51:05.171 --> 00:51:05.171
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1160
00:51:05.171 --> 00:51:05.690
<v Speaker 5>to be on a good path because first of </v>
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>

1161
00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:10.691
<v Speaker 5>I think it helps their fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of guys who were </v>

1162
00:51:10.691 --> 00:51:10.691
<v Speaker 5>Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1163
00:51:10.691 --> 00:51:14.141
<v Speaker 5>they have a little bit of extra faith.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have a little bit of extra </v>

1164
00:51:14.141 --> 00:51:14.600
<v Speaker 5>calmness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like extra belief in themselves.</v>

1165
00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:18.770
<v Speaker 5>If you truly are a believer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is a benefit to that psychological</v>

1166
00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:20.060
<v Speaker 5>as a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1167
00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:23.780
<v Speaker 5>That's why do exist for edits and Dane </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't look like it makes sense,</v>

1168
00:51:23.781 --> 00:51:26.690
<v Speaker 5>but that's why it succeeds because he'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>believers the huge benefit.</v>

1169
00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:29.900
<v Speaker 5>It helps people be disciplined and stay </v>
<v Speaker 5>on certain paths,</v>

1170
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:31.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>helps people,</v>

1171
00:51:31.041 --> 00:51:31.580
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1172
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:32.550
<v Speaker 5>stay on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1173
00:51:32.551 --> 00:51:33.740
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

1174
00:51:33.741 --> 00:51:35.810
<v Speaker 5>if you really truly believe in a higher </v>
<v Speaker 5>power,</v>

1175
00:51:35.811 --> 00:51:40.811
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's much more likely that you're going </v>

1176
00:51:40.811 --> 00:51:41.020
<v Speaker 5>to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least some sort of a code that you're</v>

1177
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:42.930
<v Speaker 5>living by.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1178
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.030
<v Speaker 5>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>

1179
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:50.670
<v Speaker 5>What is it possible to live life like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd be really nice without that mean is</v>

1180
00:51:50.991 --> 00:51:54.230
<v Speaker 5>it possible to give Vince people to live</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>

1181
00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.510
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1182
00:51:56.350 --> 00:52:01.350
<v Speaker 5>live like a free person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also live within principles of </v>

1183
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:01.940
<v Speaker 5>decency and just abandoned everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>else.</v>

1184
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:04.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm very much thing so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it takes,</v>

1185
00:52:04.251 --> 00:52:09.251
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it takes special people because not </v>

1186
00:52:09.251 --> 00:52:10.010
<v Speaker 5>everybody can handle it because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1187
00:52:10.011 --> 00:52:13.910
<v Speaker 5>unless you keep them in a little cage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dale go crazy and do all sorts of messed</v>

1188
00:52:13.911 --> 00:52:14.450
<v Speaker 5>up stuff.</v>

1189
00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:18.230
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of like the daoist I left out </v>
<v Speaker 5>is because you see them,</v>

1190
00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:20.150
<v Speaker 5>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first fatality is like,</v>

1191
00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:22.640
<v Speaker 5>our staff is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need to be smart,</v>

1192
00:52:22.641 --> 00:52:27.641
<v Speaker 5>you need to be sensible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need to have all these tools that </v>

1193
00:52:27.641 --> 00:52:28.730
<v Speaker 5>you don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So go to take confucianism instead,</v>

1194
00:52:28.731 --> 00:52:31.250
<v Speaker 5>it's better for you because you won't </v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck things up too bad.</v>

1195
00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.260
<v Speaker 5>They'll give you a simple rules to </v>
<v Speaker 5>stick,</v>

1196
00:52:33.261 --> 00:52:37.280
<v Speaker 5>to limit how much damage you can make.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Confucianism is bad,</v>

1197
00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:40.220
<v Speaker 5>therefore you seriously just go there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our stuff,</v>

1198
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:41.720
<v Speaker 5>it's too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1199
00:52:41.721 --> 00:52:46.721
<v Speaker 5>they are elitist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously they are a little bit with </v>

1200
00:52:46.721 --> 00:52:46.721
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but so is life,</v>

1201
00:52:46.721 --> 00:52:47.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not everybody's gonna get it.</v>

1202
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:48.320
<v Speaker 5>That's how it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1203
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:53.650
<v Speaker 5>it takes a hell of a human being to live</v>
<v Speaker 5>with no rules and steel behaving amazing</v>

1204
00:52:53.841 --> 00:52:55.370
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't mean it can be done.</v>

1205
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.950
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so in that sense I find,</v>

1206
00:52:57.951 --> 00:53:00.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the rules,</v>

1207
00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:05.380
<v Speaker 5>giving her allegiance useful for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>segment of humanity.</v>

1208
00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:09.850
<v Speaker 5>But then if you want to talk about full </v>
<v Speaker 5>potential of human beings,</v>

1209
00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:11.990
<v Speaker 5>I feel like no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can do better than that.</v>

1210
00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:14.120
<v Speaker 5>People have a real hard time with that </v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

1211
00:53:14.121 --> 00:53:19.121
<v Speaker 5>When you start segmenting human beings </v>
<v Speaker 5>and saying that some people are more </v>

1212
00:53:19.121 --> 00:53:21.800
<v Speaker 5>worthy or some people are more capable </v>
<v Speaker 5>or some people are more even evolved.</v>

1213
00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:26.830
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't ever last cell so I don't </v>

1214
00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:26.830
<v Speaker 5>care.</v>

1215
00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:31.190
<v Speaker 5>But I mean to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me explain it so I don't sound too </v>

1216
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:33.900
<v Speaker 5>much like a vassal butts eats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe in being nice to anybody.</v>

1217
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:35.460
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't care.</v>

1218
00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:40.620
<v Speaker 5>Meyer stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever you should treat everybody </v>

1219
00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:40.720
<v Speaker 5>giving them opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1220
00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:42.600
<v Speaker 5>it's like prove to me that you're not a </v>
<v Speaker 5>moron.</v>

1221
00:53:42.601 --> 00:53:47.601
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll give you all the opportunities in </v>

1222
00:53:47.601 --> 00:53:47.601
<v Speaker 5>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But at the same time I can be delusional</v>

1223
00:53:47.601 --> 00:53:51.830
<v Speaker 5>and expect that everybody's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>amazingly smart and you walk into any </v>

1224
00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:55.100
<v Speaker 5>room and you can throw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I kind of expect people to </v>

1225
00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:55.980
<v Speaker 5>suck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'll give them all the opportunities</v>

1226
00:53:55.981 --> 00:54:00.981
<v Speaker 5>in the world to prove otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I feel like that weighs a healthy </v>

1227
00:54:00.981 --> 00:54:04.650
<v Speaker 5>balance between being realistic about it</v>
<v Speaker 5>and being without turning into a jerk.</v>

1228
00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:06.480
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1229
00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:09.930
<v Speaker 5>so you think that if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if the government came out and said,</v>

1230
00:54:09.931 --> 00:54:10.560
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

1231
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:11.290
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1232
00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:13.340
<v Speaker 5>we did some studies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it turns out religions,</v>

1233
00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:14.280
<v Speaker 5>totally bullshit.</v>

1234
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:19.760
<v Speaker 5>And we're going to start from scratch </v>
<v Speaker 5>because we don't know what the fuck is </v>

1235
00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:23.331
<v Speaker 5>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What percentage of people do think we </v>

1236
00:54:23.331 --> 00:54:24.420
<v Speaker 5>just go completely batshit crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>riot in the streets?</v>

1237
00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:29.460
<v Speaker 5>Would it be any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would anything change it on isn't not </v>

1238
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.641
<v Speaker 5>based on evidence anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it doesn't matter what anybody tells </v>

1239
00:54:31.641 --> 00:54:31.641
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You a lot of people wouldn't be marching</v>

1240
00:54:31.641 --> 00:54:33.150
<v Speaker 5>through the street.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be one way where people would</v>

1241
00:54:33.151 --> 00:54:35.660
<v Speaker 5>like really show how much they believe </v>
<v Speaker 5>in March.</v>

1242
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:36.860
<v Speaker 5>They would start marching through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>streets.</v>

1243
00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:41.610
<v Speaker 5>They would organize it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would really put out a message,</v>

1244
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:44.040
<v Speaker 5>but that's one of the coolest things </v>
<v Speaker 5>about living in us today.</v>

1245
00:54:44.041 --> 00:54:48.210
<v Speaker 5>The in general in the Western world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll find a few.</v>

1246
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:50.970
<v Speaker 5>Not even that long hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're 200 years ago they were,</v>

1247
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll burn people on the public square </v>

1248
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:56.000
<v Speaker 5>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

1249
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:56.000
<v Speaker 5>they disagreed today.</v>

1250
00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.590
<v Speaker 5>Even the hardcore fundamentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they got all riled up and they got </v>

1251
00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:01.110
<v Speaker 5>piece,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they are not the Taliban,</v>

1252
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they may think like them,</v>

1253
00:55:02.431 --> 00:55:07.431
<v Speaker 5>but they don't act like them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we were trying to stop it from </v>

1254
00:55:07.431 --> 00:55:10.641
<v Speaker 5>getting any further than this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's anybody that has that much faith in</v>

1255
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:13.500
<v Speaker 5>what they can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1256
00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:15.510
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a disturbing thing.</v>

1257
00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.880
<v Speaker 5>You're willing to die for this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's an issue,</v>

1258
00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:22.960
<v Speaker 5>so they're willing to die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Part of worries me is you're willing to </v>

1259
00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:26.931
<v Speaker 5>kill whatever you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's your life willing to enforce your </v>

1260
00:55:26.931 --> 00:55:27.260
<v Speaker 5>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1261
00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:32.340
<v Speaker 5>The one that pissed me off the master of</v>
<v Speaker 5>this things is the euthanasia debate.</v>

1262
00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:37.700
<v Speaker 5>The fact that today in 2012 with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>technology that we have where you could </v>

1263
00:55:38.041 --> 00:55:40.840
<v Speaker 5>let people die in a good way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could black,</v>

1264
00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:42.120
<v Speaker 5>you know somebody say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1265
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:47.150
<v Speaker 5>when I get to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to be able to shoot me an </v>

1266
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.150
<v Speaker 5>injection.</v>

1267
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:50.630
<v Speaker 5>You put me to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You give me the other one that puts me </v>

1268
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.630
<v Speaker 5>out without being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1269
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:55.400
<v Speaker 5>that's their damn life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's saying that you need to die </v>

1270
00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:59.721
<v Speaker 5>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to go in whatever way you want </v>

1271
00:55:59.721 --> 00:55:59.721
<v Speaker 5>to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good for you,</v>

1272
00:55:59.721 --> 00:56:00.910
<v Speaker 5>but you really want to tell everybody </v>
<v Speaker 5>else how they die.</v>

1273
00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:03.360
<v Speaker 5>It's a tricky thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1274
00:56:03.361 --> 00:56:08.361
<v Speaker 5>because I think there's a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that have cranky old grandparents push </v>

1275
00:56:08.361 --> 00:56:09.600
<v Speaker 5>them motherfucker into that bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

1276
00:56:09.601 --> 00:56:11.100
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's been delusional right now,</v>

1277
00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:13.140
<v Speaker 5>but he's been telling us to kill him for</v>
<v Speaker 5>a couple of days.</v>

1278
00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:15.990
<v Speaker 5>Just going to go ahead and do this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's the double thing.</v>

1279
00:56:15.991 --> 00:56:19.380
<v Speaker 5>You have either people should do when </v>
<v Speaker 5>they are young,</v>

1280
00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:23.770
<v Speaker 5>what do you want to do in x amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>situations and sign it.</v>

1281
00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.840
<v Speaker 5>Then the one that are less,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they change their mind,</v>

1282
00:56:25.841 --> 00:56:30.841
<v Speaker 5>but that's what stakes or they pick </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody that the same way as they pick </v>

1283
00:56:30.841 --> 00:56:31.570
<v Speaker 5>somebody to manage their bank accounts.</v>

1284
00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:34.060
<v Speaker 5>They picked somebody who can make those </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of decisions.</v>

1285
00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:39.120
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because otherwise really you are in the </v>

1286
00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.180
<v Speaker 5>position where today you have a sick </v>
<v Speaker 5>dog,</v>

1287
00:56:40.181 --> 00:56:43.450
<v Speaker 5>you can take them to the vet and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>are gone in no time with no pain,</v>

1288
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:46.540
<v Speaker 5>but for human being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to suffer every step of the way</v>

1289
00:56:46.541 --> 00:56:51.541
<v Speaker 5>senior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your body go to crap and it's very </v>

1290
00:56:51.541 --> 00:56:51.890
<v Speaker 5>uncomfortable with giving somebody the </v>
<v Speaker 5>power to shut off a life.</v>

1291
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:54.070
<v Speaker 5>We're very uncomfortable with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1292
00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:59.470
<v Speaker 5>It's tricky and in my mind is that's you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

1293
00:56:59.471 --> 00:57:04.471
<v Speaker 5>when you love somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you care for somebody and you see them </v>

1294
00:57:04.471 --> 00:57:04.471
<v Speaker 5>go down that path and that's what they </v>
<v Speaker 5>want.</v>

1295
00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.610
<v Speaker 5>That's the biggest thing you can do for </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1296
00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:08.960
<v Speaker 5>Just let them die the way they want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1297
00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:10.210
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see what you're saying.</v>

1298
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:10.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1299
00:57:10.871 --> 00:57:12.790
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think people,</v>

1300
00:57:12.791 --> 00:57:15.370
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are very uncomfortable with the idea,</v>

1301
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:16.720
<v Speaker 5>especially religious folks.</v>

1302
00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's God the side when you get to yours,</v>

1303
00:57:19.641 --> 00:57:22.750
<v Speaker 5>so let you waste away for six more </v>
<v Speaker 5>months in order.</v>

1304
00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:25.660
<v Speaker 5>But essentially they do kill you anyway </v>
<v Speaker 5>with painkillers.</v>

1305
00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:27.280
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with a lot of people when they,</v>

1306
00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:30.910
<v Speaker 5>when it's towards the end,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep flooding you with painkillers.</v>

1307
00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:35.970
<v Speaker 5>It's not pleasant because he's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't feel anything or they don't </v>

1308
00:57:36.341 --> 00:57:38.840
<v Speaker 5>realize that anything they do realize </v>
<v Speaker 5>that feel,</v>

1309
00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:44.550
<v Speaker 5>don't realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like it's not a productive way </v>

1310
00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:44.550
<v Speaker 5>to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck,</v>

1311
00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:48.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm over the school of thought and just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1312
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:52.960
<v Speaker 5>just what happens when they cure that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happens when people don't get old?</v>

1313
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:55.030
<v Speaker 5>How many goddamn people are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>here?</v>

1314
00:57:55.031 --> 00:57:58.600
<v Speaker 5>If they figured out how to stop people </v>
<v Speaker 5>from getting old and dying,</v>

1315
00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:01.580
<v Speaker 5>we might have a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We might not even.</v>

1316
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:04.240
<v Speaker 5>We might have to build spaceships,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see it as well.</v>

1317
00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:09.240
<v Speaker 5>There are too many people just at that </v>
<v Speaker 5>point or will be more and more and more </v>

1318
00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:12.770
<v Speaker 5>if we start dying and keep people kept </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking right would be nuts.</v>

1319
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:18.140
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ at that point is where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can have the UFC have,</v>

1320
00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:18.590
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1321
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:21.700
<v Speaker 5>give a sword to some dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put them in a cage and everything,</v>

1322
00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:26.760
<v Speaker 5>go at each other for any show you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a disagreement with anybody or </v>

1323
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:30.870
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Please circle it with swords in the </v>

1324
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.870
<v Speaker 5>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it sounds really stupid to say,</v>

1325
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:34.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that people would devolve to that level,</v>

1326
00:58:34.031 --> 00:58:37.360
<v Speaker 5>but when you get like a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>together,</v>

1327
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:41.910
<v Speaker 5>they sort of devalue each other when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>have too many of them in the,</v>

1328
00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:46.980
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that deposit it in the future and </v>

1329
00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:47.800
<v Speaker 5>radiation sickness and who knows what </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fuck's going to be going on now?</v>

1330
00:58:47.801 --> 00:58:49.300
<v Speaker 5>Life becomes cheap people.</v>

1331
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:54.390
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of like even in the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 5>world where people die left and right </v>

1332
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:57.271
<v Speaker 5>all around and people were a lot less </v>
<v Speaker 5>sensitive about a human life where you </v>

1333
00:58:57.271 --> 00:59:01.741
<v Speaker 5>could have the gladiator or some people </v>
<v Speaker 5>clap and think it's cool because it's </v>

1334
00:59:01.741 --> 00:59:01.990
<v Speaker 5>like they see people dying left and </v>
<v Speaker 5>right all the time,</v>

1335
00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:03.910
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least you got to die.</v>

1336
00:59:03.911 --> 00:59:06.410
<v Speaker 5>After you train a bunch of minds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You look like a hero,</v>

1337
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:07.780
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got your head chopped off,</v>

1338
00:59:07.781 --> 00:59:10.000
<v Speaker 5>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you are going to die anyway,</v>

1339
00:59:10.001 --> 00:59:12.370
<v Speaker 5>six months in some other way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so might as well.</v>

1340
00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.100
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it amazing when you really stop </v>
<v Speaker 5>and think about it?</v>

1341
00:59:15.101 --> 00:59:20.101
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it incredible that people ever got</v>
<v Speaker 5>past ancient Rome we ever got to today?</v>

1342
00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:26.400
<v Speaker 5>Think how nutty those assholes were?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The people were finding lines with </v>

1343
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.680
<v Speaker 5>swords and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do it throw lines at people.</v>

1344
00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:29.390
<v Speaker 5>God Damn what?</v>

1345
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:34.390
<v Speaker 5>A bunch of crazy assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two weeks ago some guy emails me from </v>

1346
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:38.141
<v Speaker 5>the history channel and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you by any chance an expert on </v>

1347
00:59:38.141 --> 00:59:38.580
<v Speaker 5>Caligula the Roman emperor?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like,</v>

1348
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:40.160
<v Speaker 5>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1349
00:59:40.161 --> 00:59:42.440
<v Speaker 5>I read to my Roman historian stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's like,</v>

1350
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:43.850
<v Speaker 5>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just come on,</v>

1351
00:59:44.650 --> 00:59:46.160
<v Speaker 5>read my email,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1352
00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:51.600
<v Speaker 5>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you sound great because you've known </v>

1353
00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:51.600
<v Speaker 5>you've got a book that you looked at </v>
<v Speaker 5>once.</v>

1354
00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.710
<v Speaker 5>So I was an expert on Caligula.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The history channel is awesome.</v>

1355
00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.570
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was cool actually.</v>

1356
00:59:56.571 --> 00:59:58.250
<v Speaker 5>They did their homework.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read all their stuff.</v>

1357
00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.410
<v Speaker 5>They was all on the spot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1358
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.790
<v Speaker 5>funnier than the history channel when </v>
<v Speaker 5>they got to do that.</v>

1359
01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.310
<v Speaker 5>Comes onto sasquatch expert.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1360
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:09.410
<v Speaker 5>Like what it's been lately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And how,</v>

1361
01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:14.780
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so how much did you have to know for </v>

1362
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:14.780
<v Speaker 5>them to use you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1363
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.340
<v Speaker 5>I was actually surprised that I knew </v>
<v Speaker 5>more than I thought I did,</v>

1364
01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:21.770
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not like I'm the expert because I </v>

1365
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:21.770
<v Speaker 5>wanted to highlight or add something.</v>

1366
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:21.920
<v Speaker 5>But then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

1367
01:00:21.921 --> 01:00:25.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you have to research it before?</v>

1368
01:00:25.701 --> 01:00:26.390
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cool shit.</v>

1369
01:00:26.391 --> 01:00:27.840
<v Speaker 5>They bet their homework,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1370
01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:33.200
<v Speaker 5>So I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He read the whole thing and everything </v>

1371
01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.830
<v Speaker 5>and to make the connection fast there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you don't think about it for five </v>

1372
01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:35.830
<v Speaker 5>needle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going,</v>

1373
01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:35.830
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1374
01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:38.410
<v Speaker 5>but Culligan man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy motherfucker.</v>

1375
01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:40.180
<v Speaker 5>That guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't mind sort of wild,</v>

1376
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:42.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean Caligula was sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1377
01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:45.020
<v Speaker 5>to the 10th power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Roman Culture in general,</v>

1378
01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:48.370
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy's were violent with pointed.</v>

1379
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>What a ship roll.</v>

1411
01:02:14.391 --> 01:02:17.570
<v Speaker 5>The dice that is getting born and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>living in ancient Rome.</v>

1412
01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:21.330
<v Speaker 5>It was spun out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>UFC started both the people who hated it</v>

1413
01:02:21.331 --> 01:02:25.080
<v Speaker 5>and the people who loved it compared to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the gladiators gladiator opening.</v>

1414
01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.200
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we just abandoned it into the new one is</v>

1415
01:02:28.201 --> 01:02:30.330
<v Speaker 5>fucking crazy and seemed unusual or new </v>
<v Speaker 5>ones.</v>

1416
01:02:30.331 --> 01:02:31.610
<v Speaker 5>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

1417
01:02:31.611 --> 01:02:32.080
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1418
01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:34.590
<v Speaker 5>the gladiator opening was on for a long </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1419
01:02:34.591 --> 01:02:36.600
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who is this gladiator dude?</v>

1420
01:02:36.601 --> 01:02:39.120
<v Speaker 5>What is all this about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rubbing dirt in his hands and shit.</v>

1421
01:02:39.121 --> 01:02:41.210
<v Speaker 5>And it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

1422
01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:43.890
<v Speaker 5>you know with the Italian music,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1423
01:02:43.891 --> 01:02:48.630
<v Speaker 5>And then it's the opening onto the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the new.</v>

1424
01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:50.430
<v Speaker 5>The new opening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is Wick it though?</v>

1425
01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:50.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1426
01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:52.250
<v Speaker 8>Huh?</v>

1427
01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:56.610
<v Speaker 5>The gladiators,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what was Caligula's deal quickly.</v>

1428
01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:58.910
<v Speaker 5>It was completely out of his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>mind basically.</v>

1429
01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:02.230
<v Speaker 5>Was He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think he was clinically insane or</v>

1430
01:03:02.231 --> 01:03:05.610
<v Speaker 5>you think it was just mad with power?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's the beginning of it.</v>

1431
01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:10.780
<v Speaker 5>Then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna operate in an environment </v>

1432
01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:10.780
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1433
01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:10.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your Ankle Keel,</v>

1434
01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:15.120
<v Speaker 5>soul of your family or brothers and </v>
<v Speaker 5>sisters and her mom to the point that </v>

1435
01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.950
<v Speaker 5>she was a scenario and then gets there </v>
<v Speaker 5>to start to that,</v>

1436
01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the environment you grew up </v>

1437
01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.851
<v Speaker 5>around Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if you are totally saying you </v>

1438
01:03:23.851 --> 01:03:26.761
<v Speaker 5>started going elite along over the edge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why they do that to everybody because </v>

1439
01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:31.321
<v Speaker 5>they are a main bus starts and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they protected their own power and </v>

1440
01:03:31.321 --> 01:03:32.890
<v Speaker 5>anybody that they felt could be a threat</v>
<v Speaker 5>to their power,</v>

1441
01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:35.320
<v Speaker 5>they would get rid of them in fairly </v>
<v Speaker 5>nasty ways.</v>

1442
01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:36.910
<v Speaker 5>Price.</v>

1443
01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.980
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's no different than any gang or any,</v>

1444
01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:40.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's human nature that way.</v>

1445
01:03:40.601 --> 01:03:42.340
<v Speaker 5>Where at its worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1446
01:03:42.341 --> 01:03:44.440
<v Speaker 5>because there was no rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Essentially they were,</v>

1447
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:46.800
<v Speaker 5>they were calling the shots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazingly,</v>

1448
01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:51.010
<v Speaker 5>people ever get to a point of royalty </v>
<v Speaker 5>that people allow that hustle.</v>

1449
01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:56.220
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very strange hustle that even </v>

1450
01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:56.630
<v Speaker 5>though there's no fucking food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's starving.</v>

1451
01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:57.310
<v Speaker 5>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1452
01:03:57.311 --> 01:03:58.900
<v Speaker 5>there's no prosperity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no books.</v>

1453
01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:04.080
<v Speaker 5>People are so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll believe that this one guy is </v>

1454
01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.470
<v Speaker 5>worth more than everybody else controls </v>
<v Speaker 5>their armies and he's their noble leader</v>

1455
01:04:05.471 --> 01:04:06.220
<v Speaker 5>and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that would.</v>

1456
01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:09.400
<v Speaker 5>That would be a cool job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I sign up for that after you guys pulled</v>

1457
01:04:09.401 --> 01:04:13.150
<v Speaker 5>that job off and then somebody would </v>
<v Speaker 5>kill you with a sword.</v>

1458
01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:14.680
<v Speaker 5>I think today I started,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1459
01:04:14.681 --> 01:04:15.490
<v Speaker 5>I started saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1460
01:04:15.491 --> 01:04:20.491
<v Speaker 5>most people suck and I have a disability</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that I want to be the king of the </v>

1461
01:04:20.491 --> 01:04:21.190
<v Speaker 5>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be great.</v>

1462
01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:25.930
<v Speaker 5>That I think every smart person thinks </v>
<v Speaker 5>that there would be an awesome king.</v>

1463
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:27.130
<v Speaker 5>I would be different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

1464
01:04:27.131 --> 01:04:29.560
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd be assholes or I was the king.</v>

1465
01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.810
<v Speaker 5>That's how every cart gets caught,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets started,</v>

1466
01:04:31.930 --> 01:04:33.610
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think I have the a good up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it crazy that your va,</v>

1496
01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:46.720
<v Speaker 2>your body actually produces a vitamin by</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the sun?</v>

1497
01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:48.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're out in the sun.</v>

1498
01:05:48.101 --> 01:05:53.101
<v Speaker 2>Your body produces vitamin D.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why when you see like George St </v>

1499
01:05:53.101 --> 01:05:53.101
<v Speaker 2>Pierre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he's fighting and he gets Tan,</v>

1500
01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:58.320
<v Speaker 2>that getting pampered like that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually actually makes you perform </v>

1501
01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:58.320
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing nuts.</v>

1502
01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:02.020
<v Speaker 2>That fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting a Tan actually makes you perform</v>

1503
01:06:02.021 --> 01:06:04.120
<v Speaker 2>better as a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

1504
01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:08.290
<v Speaker 2>What is the bad part about having a tea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Much d though.</v>

1505
01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:11.080

<v Speaker 1>How people that have questions to </v>

1549
01:07:49.911 --> 01:07:49.911
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they contact you and then they could buy</v>

1550
01:07:49.911 --> 01:07:54.831
<v Speaker 1>your books to what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is your one that you published </v>

1551
01:07:54.831 --> 01:07:54.831
<v Speaker 1>recently on disinfect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that called?</v>

1552
01:07:54.831 --> 01:07:57.600
<v Speaker 1>It's called the 50 seats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are not supposed to know religion.</v>

1553
01:07:57.870 --> 01:08:02.870
<v Speaker 1>And the genesis of this was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because originally phd from </v>

1554
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:03.990
<v Speaker 1>book about religion and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1555
01:08:03.991 --> 01:08:04.980
<v Speaker 1>these big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thick,</v>

1556
01:08:05.010 --> 01:08:07.150
<v Speaker 1>heavy book and that they are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1557
01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:07.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sweet,</v>

1558
01:08:07.921 --> 01:08:09.570
<v Speaker 1>but we're in the business of selling </v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

1559
01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.060
<v Speaker 1>So give us something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1560
01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:13.230
<v Speaker 1>what is the big thick work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that going to be about?</v>

1561
01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:14.420
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1562
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of looking at</v>

1563
01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:20.330
<v Speaker 5>old basically what the approach that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Bruce Lee added to martial arts,</v>

1564
01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:22.660
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to play,</v>
<v Speaker 5>adapted to religions,</v>

1565
01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:27.850
<v Speaker 5>sort of like taking a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 5>religions to look at what all the big </v>

1566
01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:31.750
<v Speaker 5>questions are a look at what some of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>answers that are out there to make up </v>

1567
01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:33.130
<v Speaker 5>your own thing as you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1568
01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:35.360
<v Speaker 5>because ultimately to me that's the only</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that anybody does,</v>

1569
01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:36.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1570
01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:40.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm making call Legion college </v>
<v Speaker 5>philosophically.</v>

1571
01:08:40.730 --> 01:08:44.090
<v Speaker 5>Whatever makes you feel good about </v>
<v Speaker 5>bottom line is a way of life.</v>

1572
01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:47.480
<v Speaker 5>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do your own work to see what's out there</v>

1573
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.250
<v Speaker 5>and come up with your own answers that </v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

1574
01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:53.900
<v Speaker 5>And actually now that we did this one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they decided to go for it.</v>

1575
01:08:53.901 --> 01:08:57.020
<v Speaker 5>So I think I will publish the other one </v>
<v Speaker 5>toward the end of the year,</v>

1576
01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:58.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in end of 2012.</v>

1577
01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:03.020
<v Speaker 5>So this would be a really big book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They asked me to cut it a bit and it's a</v>

1578
01:09:03.021 --> 01:09:08.021
<v Speaker 5>good idea because there's too much stuff</v>
<v Speaker 5>and people will be like halfway through </v>

1579
01:09:08.021 --> 01:09:08.870
<v Speaker 5>what I go back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's no more but uh,</v>

1580
01:09:08.871 --> 01:09:10.300
<v Speaker 5>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll do that one,</v>

1581
01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:14.270
<v Speaker 5>cutting it a bit and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that one I was super excited about,</v>

1582
01:09:14.271 --> 01:09:19.271
<v Speaker 5>but back then they are actually smart </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they know that this kind of </v>

1583
01:09:19.271 --> 01:09:19.271
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sales because he's um,</v>

1584
01:09:19.271 --> 01:09:20.710
<v Speaker 5>quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>funny,</v>

1585
01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:21.680
<v Speaker 5>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>random,</v>

1586
01:09:21.681 --> 01:09:23.980
<v Speaker 5>informative stories in and out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1587
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:25.580
<v Speaker 5>you read the one next,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1588
01:09:25.581 --> 01:09:27.080
<v Speaker 5>you don't feel like you're liking that </v>
<v Speaker 5>one,</v>

1589
01:09:27.081 --> 01:09:28.460
<v Speaker 5>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You jump to the next one.</v>

1590
01:09:28.461 --> 01:09:31.370
<v Speaker 5>So there's 50 of them and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

1591
01:09:31.371 --> 01:09:36.371
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was weird because when I originally </v>

1592
01:09:36.371 --> 01:09:38.710
<v Speaker 5>signed up to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was in as now I'm really happy I </v>

1593
01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:38.960
<v Speaker 5>did it when I started,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1594
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:40.340
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I needed money.</v>

1595
01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:41.750
<v Speaker 5>I guess so sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the hell,</v>

1596
01:09:41.751 --> 01:09:45.700
<v Speaker 5>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But in my initial mom and Danny was in a</v>

1597
01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.080
<v Speaker 5>shitty period of my life because I </v>
<v Speaker 5>signed on,</v>

1598
01:09:48.081 --> 01:09:53.081
<v Speaker 5>it was like January 2011 or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I said sure,</v>

1599
01:09:53.511 --> 01:09:55.720
<v Speaker 5>I'll get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they like do it by April.</v>

1600
01:09:56.210 --> 01:09:57.890
<v Speaker 5>Like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a little tight,</v>

1601
01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:01.580
<v Speaker 5>but sure I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then that's when everything went to shit</v>

1602
01:10:01.581 --> 01:10:03.860
<v Speaker 5>with my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>six weeks in the hospital,</v>

1603
01:10:03.861 --> 01:10:08.861
<v Speaker 5>horrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the second one though that was </v>

1604
01:10:08.861 --> 01:10:12.191
<v Speaker 5>over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm now responsible for a 19 month old </v>

1605
01:10:12.191 --> 01:10:16.031
<v Speaker 5>baby to deal with there all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a Montana enough read left to </v>

1607
01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:20.060

<v Speaker 5>Now that's intense.</v>

1608
01:10:20.061 --> 01:10:23.270
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the thing is generally,</v>

1609
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:25.880
<v Speaker 5>I mean I break more laws than I can keep</v>
<v Speaker 5>track of,</v>

1610
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:29.150
<v Speaker 5>but one thing I do is I don't break my </v>
<v Speaker 5>word ever.</v>

1611
01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:30.080
<v Speaker 5>And I told them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1612
01:10:30.081 --> 01:10:32.930
<v Speaker 5>I'll get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were even being nice about it.</v>

1613
01:10:32.931 --> 01:10:34.730
<v Speaker 5>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can push the deadline,</v>

1614
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:35.510
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no man,</v>

1615
01:10:35.511 --> 01:10:40.511
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wanted it done by then even eats </v>

1616
01:10:40.511 --> 01:10:40.970
<v Speaker 5>good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gives me something to focus on.</v>

1617
01:10:40.971 --> 01:10:43.100
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they do dan being there,</v>

1618
01:10:43.101 --> 01:10:48.101
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>contemplating my navel thinking the </v>

1619
01:10:48.101 --> 01:10:48.101
<v Speaker 5>word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I have something to do.</v>

1620
01:10:48.101 --> 01:10:49.670
<v Speaker 5>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it has to be funny,</v>

1621
01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:54.850
<v Speaker 5>lighthearted at a time when my life is </v>
<v Speaker 5>really not needed or funny or </v>

1622
01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:58.601
<v Speaker 5>lighthearted and sweets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was actually good therapy for me </v>

1623
01:10:58.601 --> 01:10:58.601
<v Speaker 5>because I could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1624
01:10:58.601 --> 01:11:03.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>while I'm giving my daughter meal come </v>

1625
01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:04.220
<v Speaker 5>thinking about what the hell is the next</v>
<v Speaker 5>line and I get to make it snappy,</v>

1626
01:11:04.221 --> 01:11:06.510
<v Speaker 5>fast fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but funding,</v>

1627
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:10.120
<v Speaker 5>but I think I could do for myself </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I'm,</v>

1628
01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:15.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as soon as you write while you were </v>

1629
01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.051
<v Speaker 5>holding the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as he literally got to the why where I </v>

1630
01:11:17.051 --> 01:11:18.330
<v Speaker 5>would dream about what I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>write at night.</v>

1631
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:21.300
<v Speaker 5>I would fall asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I finish writing,</v>

1632
01:11:21.301 --> 01:11:26.301
<v Speaker 5>I pass out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I dream about what I'm going to write </v>

1633
01:11:26.301 --> 01:11:26.780
<v Speaker 5>when my baby wakes up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like holding their feeding around.</v>

1634
01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:27.750
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1635
01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:30.930
<v Speaker 5>look at that thing over the next line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1636
01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:34.350
<v Speaker 5>And then the second one she would sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's when I would write the most.</v>

1637
01:11:34.351 --> 01:11:35.820
<v Speaker 5>Of course I would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

1643
01:11:41.551 --> 01:11:43.740
<v Speaker 5>How long did you do that for?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A couple of months.</v>

1644
01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.470
<v Speaker 5>It was maybe two other than to win </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough months.</v>

1645
01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.000
<v Speaker 5>That's how long it took to make the </v>
<v Speaker 5>book.</v>

1646
01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:53.420
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's 50 things that you're not </v>

1647

<v Speaker 5>supposed to know about religion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called give us one of them.</v>

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:54.630
<v Speaker 5>What's a good one to see?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's fun?</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I keep myself operating them.</v>

1651
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:11.450
<v Speaker 5>I have one chapter I think is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the stuff I was telling you earlier is </v>

1652
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:11.450
<v Speaker 5>called.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you are too stupid for them,</v>

1653
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:16.251
<v Speaker 5>you can always try confucianism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's always would make me popular in </v>

1654
01:12:16.251 --> 01:12:19.090
<v Speaker 5>China.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's this guy,</v>

1656
01:12:20.611 --> 01:12:25.611
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the title of this one is God is wearing </v>

1657
01:12:25.611 --> 01:12:26.380
<v Speaker 5>dragon robes and wants you to keep </v>
<v Speaker 5>confusion.</v>

1658
01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:28.380
<v Speaker 5>Assess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is an awesome story.</v>

1659
01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.750
<v Speaker 5>Is in the 89,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this one,</v>

1660
01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:35.760
<v Speaker 5>a Chinese guy became converted to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christianity and he started saying that </v>

1661
01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:40.500
<v Speaker 5>he was Jesus' younger brother,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you had this vision of God that was</v>

1662
01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:45.560
<v Speaker 5>wearing dragon polo shirts and told them</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Buddhism and Confucianism or crap </v>

1663
01:12:46.051 --> 01:12:51.051
<v Speaker 5>and it was his duty to stamp them out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he got their APP or this follower </v>

1664
01:12:51.051 --> 01:12:53.370
<v Speaker 5>started preaching in the countryside,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gain all these people.</v>

1665
01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:58.760
<v Speaker 5>They became so powerful that they carved</v>
<v Speaker 5>out their own state within China and </v>

1666
01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.420
<v Speaker 5>they said that this was going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forgot what it's called.</v>

1667
01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.670
<v Speaker 5>It's something that I have to find it </v>
<v Speaker 5>because there's just too good,</v>

1668
01:13:02.671 --> 01:13:05.760
<v Speaker 5>but he was called something along the </v>
<v Speaker 5>lines like a,</v>

1669
01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:09.000
<v Speaker 5>the evan leaking dome of everlasting </v>
<v Speaker 5>peace or something.</v>

1670
01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:14.720
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the heavenly kingdom of everlasting </v>

1671
01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:16.281
<v Speaker 5>peace ended up with the debt of 20 </v>
<v Speaker 5>million people in the course of civil </v>

1672
01:13:16.281 --> 01:13:19.971
<v Speaker 5>wars between the Chinese government or </v>
<v Speaker 5>was pieced over these guys thrown into </v>

1673
01:13:19.971 --> 01:13:23.631
<v Speaker 5>Medicare way and these kind of weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>version of a Chinese fundamentalist </v>

1674
01:13:24.421 --> 01:13:26.910
<v Speaker 5>Christianity fighting against that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His guys.</v>

1675
01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.330
<v Speaker 5>And eventually when they laid siege to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the CT,</v>

1676
01:13:30.331 --> 01:13:32.160
<v Speaker 5>he was telling his followers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't worry,</v>

1677
01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:35.430
<v Speaker 5>God is on our side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And of course he died shortly thereafter</v>

1678
01:13:35.431 --> 01:13:37.410
<v Speaker 5>by eating some boys on Missouri by </v>
<v Speaker 5>mistake.</v>

1679
01:13:37.411 --> 01:13:39.000
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that was that.</v>

1680
01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:42.660
<v Speaker 5>What year was this all going down?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to say meet 89,</v>

1685
01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:57.741
<v Speaker 5>was Jesus his brother and 20 million </v>
<v Speaker 5>people died as a result of this one guy.</v>

1686
01:13:58.231 --> 01:13:59.770
<v Speaker 5>Is that essentially what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And that's why is not supposed to know.</v>

1690
01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.040
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never heard about that.</v>

1691
01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:14.020
<v Speaker 5>That's such an immense number of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that died.</v>

1692
01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:19.680
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they fuck they get the numbers we </v>

1693
01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:19.680
<v Speaker 5>had the benefit of the doubt is maybe 50</v>
<v Speaker 5>meters old.</v>

1694
01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:20.400
<v Speaker 5>How knows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

1695
01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.990
<v Speaker 5>that's what some people have speculated </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the number was.</v>

1696
01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:24.430
<v Speaker 5>And how would they know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1697
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.390
<v Speaker 5>20 million people's a guests back then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1698
01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:27.480
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1699
01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:30.730
<v Speaker 5>but he's brutal civil war racking China </v>
<v Speaker 5>for a band,</v>

1700
01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:34.600
<v Speaker 5>which is one of the reasons why a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 5>of Chinese people migrated to California</v>

1701
01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:39.720
<v Speaker 5>at the time when there was the gold rush</v>
<v Speaker 5>is because south China was get the </v>

1702
01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:39.720
<v Speaker 5>indirect left and right.</v>

1703
01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:40.510
<v Speaker 5>What's this dude's name again?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1704
01:14:40.511 --> 01:14:45.430
<v Speaker 5>the guy's name was hung to something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's going to be a lot of people.</v>

1705
01:14:45.431 --> 01:14:47.730
<v Speaker 5>Gonna want to play that guy on like </v>
<v Speaker 5>video games.</v>

1706
01:14:47.731 --> 01:14:52.731
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be their name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go on as this bad motherfucker convinced</v>

1707
01:14:54.491 --> 01:14:55.740
<v Speaker 5>a bunch people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was Jesus,</v>

1708
01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:56.840
<v Speaker 5>his brother.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

1709
01:14:56.870 --> 01:15:01.870
<v Speaker 5>I have no idea how to pronounce it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a high level pimp game right </v>

1710
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:01.870
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sign Hong does.</v>

1711
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:04.660
<v Speaker 5>She would try and I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to pronounce.</v>

1712
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:06.460
<v Speaker 5>I make it tough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you spell it?</v>

1713
01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:08.440
<v Speaker 5>It's age.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1714
01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.280
<v Speaker 5>Chinese is spelled two different ways </v>
<v Speaker 5>depending on now you,</v>

1715
01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:16.180
<v Speaker 5>but the one that we're using was h o n g</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's one word.</v>

1716
01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:18.430
<v Speaker 5>And then the next word is x.</v>
<v Speaker 5>i,</v>

1717
01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:22.470
<v Speaker 5>u q u a n.</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

1718
01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:27.510
<v Speaker 5>So good luck fixing on this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really fascinating the way the </v>

1719
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:29.810
<v Speaker 5>Chinese have a language,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1720
01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:31.630
<v Speaker 5>it's phonetic obviously because if </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

1721
01:15:31.631 --> 01:15:33.460
<v Speaker 5>they have totally different characters </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we have,</v>

1722
01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:36.910
<v Speaker 5>but the way they've expressed it in like</v>
<v Speaker 5>the letters that we use.</v>

1723
01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:39.520
<v Speaker 5>So it's bizarre really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of the words are really strange,</v>

1724
01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.320
<v Speaker 5>especially like with x's and them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

1725
01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:45.070
<v Speaker 5>My wife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my wife is Chinese and she was trying to</v>

1726
01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:50.100
<v Speaker 5>teach me some Chinese and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I couldn't say it because she </v>

1727
01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:50.980
<v Speaker 5>kind of hated Japanese people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was thinking,</v>

1728
01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:53.170
<v Speaker 5>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't you just be Japanese is so much</v>

1729
01:15:53.171 --> 01:15:54.670
<v Speaker 5>easier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Japanese is easier to learn.</v>

1730
01:15:54.671 --> 01:15:56.850
<v Speaker 5>Easier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the way you read it,</v>

1731
01:15:56.851 --> 01:16:00.500
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of the way you pronounce it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's only one toe on it.</v>

1732
01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:04.660
<v Speaker 5>It's easier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chinese is the same exact ward with tiny</v>

1733
01:16:04.661 --> 01:16:06.970
<v Speaker 5>different tax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That means completely different things.</v>

1734
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.730
<v Speaker 5>And there are like four different tax </v>
<v Speaker 5>ids for each ward.</v>

1735
01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.070
<v Speaker 5>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just like,</v>

1736
01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.750
<v Speaker 5>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can anybody say anything?</v>

1737
01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:17.200
<v Speaker 5>So you think it's more complicated than </v>
<v Speaker 5>English?</v>

1738
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:20.290
<v Speaker 5>English is a hard one to learn though </v>
<v Speaker 5>for some reason.</v>

1739
01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm sure if that's where you come</v>
<v Speaker 5>from,</v>

1740
01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:24.190
<v Speaker 5>if you speak Chinese or something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1741
01:16:24.191 --> 01:16:29.191
<v Speaker 5>English must be a pain in the ass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for anybody coming from a vaguely </v>

1742
01:16:29.191 --> 01:16:33.871
<v Speaker 5>Latino background or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any of the Western languages trying to </v>

1743
01:16:33.871 --> 01:16:35.020
<v Speaker 5>pick up chain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any tonal language like Chinese,</v>

1744
01:16:35.021 --> 01:16:36.180
<v Speaker 5>Vietnamese,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of those,</v>

1745
01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:38.640
<v Speaker 5>it's just like that.</v>

1746
01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:42.700
<v Speaker 5>It is pretty fucked up that we all speak</v>
<v Speaker 5>different languages.</v>

1747
01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:43.810
<v Speaker 5>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1748
01:16:43.811 --> 01:16:48.811
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many problems would be solved if </v>

1749
01:16:48.811 --> 01:16:51.541
<v Speaker 5>everybody spoke one language that would </v>
<v Speaker 5>be nice to solve anything at this point </v>

1750
01:16:51.731 --> 01:16:56.731
<v Speaker 5>in time would it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>People hate each other from New York to </v>

1751
01:16:56.731 --> 01:16:56.731
<v Speaker 5>Irvine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you don't.</v>

1752
01:16:56.731 --> 01:16:57.910
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it would out.</v>

1753
01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.070
<v Speaker 5>You will be better than nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's for sure.</v>

1754
01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:02.450
<v Speaker 5>It is pretty crazy how different </v>
<v Speaker 5>languages are too.</v>

1755
01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:05.170
<v Speaker 5>I mean the difference between like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Chinese and Norway,</v>

1756
01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:09.710
<v Speaker 5>Norwegian and Chinese accuser in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bigger difference.</v>

1757
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Is it even possible to get something </v>
<v Speaker 1>more Chinese and you know,</v>

1758
01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:17.300
<v Speaker 1>how about Chinese and African tribal </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages for.</v>

1759
01:17:17.301 --> 01:17:19.230
<v Speaker 1>They're all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the.</v>

1760
01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1761
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

1762
01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:27.770
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so incredible how it evolves </v>

1763
01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:29.600
<v Speaker 1>differently in different areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it all evolves.</v>

1764
01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:32.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many different languages are there?</v>

1765
01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Are there hundreds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands.</v>

1766
01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go on some bullshit guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>since say what?</v>

1767
01:17:39.911 --> 01:17:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Surviving today because of course their </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

1768
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.970
<v Speaker 1>but wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1769
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:49.580
<v Speaker 1>but let me bullshit first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's try surviving today.</v>

1770
01:17:49.581 --> 01:17:49.970
<v Speaker 1>I want to say</v>

1771
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:50.590
<v Speaker 9>say</v>

1772
01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:52.790
<v Speaker 1>the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're 50.</v>

1773
01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll say</v>

1774
01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:57.950
<v Speaker 1>176,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say a thousand.</v>

1775
01:17:58.030 --> 01:18:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I think you're actually closer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more I'm thinking about it because </v>

1776
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:04.450
<v Speaker 1>there are a bunch of languages in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1777
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They between six thousand eight hundred </v>

1778
01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:09.630
<v Speaker 1>and six thousand nine hundred distinct </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

1779
01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:11.470
<v Speaker 1>The modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

1780
01:18:11.471 --> 01:18:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Where we off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

1781
01:18:13.841 --> 01:18:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Where we off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are the closest dude.</v>

1782
01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1783
01:18:17.011 --> 01:18:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I thought I thought I overshot it to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest with you.</v>

1784
01:18:19.911 --> 01:18:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was probably around 900.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1785
01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

1786
01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean 90 percent of that or languages </v>

1787
01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:32.311
<v Speaker 1>that are dying that are like 30 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a tribe is still speak and clicking </v>

1788
01:18:32.651 --> 01:18:35.440
<v Speaker 1>noises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clicking noises.</v>

1789
01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how bizarre is that when they have </v>

1790
01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:42.361
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's some spots in the Amazon </v>

1791
01:18:42.361 --> 01:18:42.361
<v Speaker 1>that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1792
01:18:42.361 --> 01:18:45.400
<v Speaker 1>just just recently discovered people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these tribes and the,</v>

1793
01:18:45.401 --> 01:18:48.750
<v Speaker 1>this is the first contact that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>having with the modern world and they're</v>

1794
01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:51.400
<v Speaker 1>in there with their own wacky language </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they sit at.</v>

1795
01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.710
<v Speaker 1>One of the few guys have had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with them.</v>

1796
01:18:53.711 --> 01:18:55.360
<v Speaker 1>They promptly killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

1797
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Good luck making contact again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The someone made contact with him,</v>

1798
01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:03.020
<v Speaker 1>there was one guy who was like an India </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a different tribe,</v>

1799
01:19:03.021 --> 01:19:07.000
<v Speaker 1>so he kind of understood their language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she also was,</v>

1800
01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:12.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more immersed into mother and Lord and </v>

1801
01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:14.041
<v Speaker 1>they'll have less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was kind of like in transition </v>

1802
01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:14.041
<v Speaker 1>between those two words and they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1803
01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:14.650
<v Speaker 1>they killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows why,</v>

1804
01:19:14.651 --> 01:19:15.610
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they walked him.</v>

1805
01:19:15.970 --> 01:19:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they probably have heard that </v>

1806
01:19:20.970 --> 01:19:22.891
<v Speaker 1>some shit goes down when the loggers </v>
<v Speaker 1>move in and you know that that is what </v>

1807
01:19:22.891 --> 01:19:24.430
<v Speaker 1>happens to these people probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1808
01:19:24.431 --> 01:19:27.140
<v Speaker 1>There's w.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What folks don't know is there was a,</v>

1809
01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:30.520
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they are people.</v>

1810
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:34.510
<v Speaker 1>They're living like people used to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years ago.</v>

1811
01:19:35.010 --> 01:19:37.390
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're essentially essentially,</v>

1812
01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:43.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in ancient tribal lifestyle that </v>

1813
01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:44.080
<v Speaker 1>we didn't really even think existed </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1814
01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:48.130
<v Speaker 1>They have their own handmade tools and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons and you know,</v>

1815
01:19:48.131 --> 01:19:53.131
<v Speaker 1>they're wearing like fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves on their dicks and shit and </v>

1816
01:19:53.131 --> 01:19:54.970
<v Speaker 1>animal skins and it's there and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>still in there.</v>

1817
01:19:54.971 --> 01:19:59.971
<v Speaker 1>And then these people who are logging </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going deeper and deeper into the </v>

1818
01:19:59.971 --> 01:20:02.070
<v Speaker 1>forest and they're just cutting down at </v>
<v Speaker 1>an astounding rate.</v>

1819
01:20:02.071 --> 01:20:07.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's all these incredible </v>

1820
01:20:07.071 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 1>medicines to be found there and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these different and animals that haven't</v>

1821
01:20:08.251 --> 01:20:11.610
<v Speaker 1>even been discovered yet and insects </v>
<v Speaker 1>that haven't been discovered yet.</v>

1822
01:20:11.611 --> 01:20:14.860
<v Speaker 1>And who knows what the fuck's in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're just shopping that shit down</v>

1823
01:20:14.861 --> 01:20:19.861
<v Speaker 1>and left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these people oftentimes are getting </v>

1824
01:20:19.861 --> 01:20:19.861
<v Speaker 1>caught up in this where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1825
01:20:19.861 --> 01:20:21.550
<v Speaker 1>they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lived there in that forest and that</v>

1826
01:20:21.570 --> 01:20:26.570
<v Speaker 1>deep in there for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden one day they </v>

1827
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:29.100
<v Speaker 1>wake up and they're fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there watching trees fall in the</v>

1828
01:20:29.101 --> 01:20:29.770
<v Speaker 1>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1829
01:20:29.771 --> 01:20:31.140
<v Speaker 1>like what the fuck is going on?</v>

1830
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:36.350
<v Speaker 1>And they just coming towards you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an inevitable swarm of tree eating </v>

1831
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:40.020
<v Speaker 1>machines and there are all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these greedy people behind them and they</v>

1832
01:20:40.021 --> 01:20:43.470
<v Speaker 1>don't want to move around you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to chop your fucking trees</v>

1833
01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:44.480
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get outta here.</v>

1834
01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's living like a savage.</v>

1835
01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at him like you're </v>

<v Speaker 1>Trapping and shit down.</v>

1838
01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:56.280
<v Speaker 1>We have all those people had a wild life</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time.</v>

1839
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Who's to say their life isn't more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1840
01:20:58.950 --> 01:21:01.170
<v Speaker 1>This is doing Iowasca and fishing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1841
01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:03.360
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're pretty dope,</v>

1842
01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:06.180
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get used to living in the jungle,</v>

1843
01:21:06.181 --> 01:21:07.470
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard life,</v>

1844
01:21:07.650 --> 01:21:10.080
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of food there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1845
01:21:10.230 --> 01:21:15.230
<v Speaker 1>you could become it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could become food fucked up that to </v>

1846
01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:20.630
<v Speaker 1>zig when he should've zagged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing called a Brazilian </v>

1847
01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:23.760
<v Speaker 1>wondering spider that kills you by </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving you an erection until you die.</v>

1848
01:21:26.490 --> 01:21:30.720
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has something to do with nitric oxide</v>

1849
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:36.030
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like the same stuff that's in </v>

1850
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.210
<v Speaker 1>the works and like Viagra and stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes your dick hard.</v>

1851
01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.070
<v Speaker 1>And apparently this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1852
01:21:38.130 --> 01:21:42.740
<v Speaker 1>this spider hits you with it and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes some crazy fucking reaction.</v>

1853
01:21:42.741 --> 01:21:45.320
<v Speaker 1>It's neurotoxin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the most powerful neurotoxin.</v>

1854
01:21:45.321 --> 01:21:50.321
<v Speaker 1>None of the man and your whole body just</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely stiffens up and horrifying </v>

1855
01:21:50.431 --> 01:21:54.420
<v Speaker 1>agony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your Dick gets hard as fuck so hard.</v>

1856
01:21:54.421 --> 01:21:59.421
<v Speaker 1>It's like breaking like your Dick is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorged and breaking and even if you </v>

1857
01:21:59.421 --> 01:22:01.320
<v Speaker 1>survive it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which most people don't survive,</v>

1858
01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:04.290
<v Speaker 1>but even if you do survive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Dick will be destroyed.</v>

1859
01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:07.680
<v Speaker 1>The deq would be useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would just be a bag of bruises.</v>

1860
01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:10.170
<v Speaker 3>Sound like fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just from one bite from one,</v>

1861
01:22:10.171 --> 01:22:13.830
<v Speaker 3>but what if it just linked you and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just had a really hard boner all the</v>

1862
01:22:13.831 --> 01:22:18.831
<v Speaker 3>time in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't work that way if you just got a </v>

1863
01:22:18.831 --> 01:22:18.831
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work that way,</v>

1864
01:22:18.831 --> 01:22:18.831
<v Speaker 3>but I do believe that</v>

1865
01:22:18.831 --> 01:22:22.910
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigating the effect that this thing</v>

1866
01:22:22.911 --> 01:22:25.580
<v Speaker 1>has on your body to develop new hard on </v>
<v Speaker 1>medication.</v>

1867
01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:26.680

<v Speaker 3>That's the next thing you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the side where you just put your dick in</v>

<v Speaker 1>He survived.</v>

1921
01:24:57.850 --> 01:24:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:02.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he actually kind of looked like once</v>

1923
01:25:02.211 --> 01:25:04.010
<v Speaker 1>he cleaned up and dried out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything like that,</v>

1924
01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:05.140
<v Speaker 1>he actually looked like you made it </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

1925
01:25:05.141 --> 01:25:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is even more crazy.</v>

1926
01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't that.</v>

1927
01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just some dudes out there,</v>

1928
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:11.930
<v Speaker 1>but I mean that's the random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he told you,</v>

1929
01:25:11.931 --> 01:25:16.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fucking die in the </v>

1930
01:25:16.931 --> 01:25:18.271
<v Speaker 1>safest place in the water because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody could fall on you or </v>

1931
01:25:18.271 --> 01:25:20.451
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can sweeten the Amazon for </v>

1932
01:25:20.451 --> 01:25:20.451
<v Speaker 1>thousands of miles and come out fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1933
01:25:20.451 --> 01:25:21.460
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1934
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing that people have for </v>

1935
01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:27.160
<v Speaker 1>wanting to do difficult things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1936
01:25:27.210 --> 01:25:32.210
<v Speaker 1>I tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt that way about like </v>

1937
01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Mount Everest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a joke about it.</v>

1938
01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just because something's hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do doesn't mean it's good to do.</v>

1939
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:40.030
<v Speaker 1>See people get a little confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is because the difficult things to do</v>

1940
01:25:40.241 --> 01:25:42.450
<v Speaker 1>in this life usually come with reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1941
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:43.500
<v Speaker 1>your risk yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1942
01:25:43.670 --> 01:25:48.670
<v Speaker 1>you leave your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start your own business and that </v>

1943
01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:50.550
<v Speaker 1>reward is how it worked and now you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>making it financially.</v>

1944
01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Graduations you're a success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a risk and there's reward in </v>

1945
01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:56.170
<v Speaker 1>that case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

1946
01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:59.680
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't look like the reward is </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth it.</v>

1947
01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:00.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1948
01:26:00.650 --> 01:26:01.060
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1949
01:26:02.770 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 1>If you could stop</v>

1950
01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:06.200
<v Speaker 5>put,</v>
<v Speaker 5>letting.</v>

1951
01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:11.320
<v Speaker 5>Is there a way that you could ever say </v>
<v Speaker 5>that anyone running for president cannot</v>

1952
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:15.950
<v Speaker 5>talk about religion?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like even if you believe,</v>

1953
01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:21.180
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like you shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 5>allowed to talk about it in the </v>

1954
01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:22.320
<v Speaker 5>political process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like cheating,</v>

1955
01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:25.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like you're not,</v>

1956
01:26:25.731 --> 01:26:26.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1957
01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.520
<v Speaker 5>you're going after your people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1958
01:26:28.521 --> 01:26:30.200
<v Speaker 5>You just trying to get your people </v>
<v Speaker 5>divorce,</v>

1959
01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:32.120
<v Speaker 5>like will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>

1960
01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:33.530
<v Speaker 5>That's our little chunk of fewer </v>
<v Speaker 5>opioids.</v>

1961
01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.630
<v Speaker 5>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was supposed to be that way though,</v>

1962
01:26:35.631 --> 01:26:36.220
<v Speaker 5>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1963
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:37.600
<v Speaker 5>This time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1964
01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:38.450
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

1965
01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:40.660
<v Speaker 5>I think honestly what happened is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Utopian about,</v>

1966
01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:43.910
<v Speaker 5>so could they offer early dress waters </v>
<v Speaker 5>for so long that they,</v>

1967
01:26:43.911 --> 01:26:46.640
<v Speaker 5>people got really annoyed by it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

1968
01:26:46.641 --> 01:26:49.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm done enough of this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were chopping each other's bowls.</v>

1969
01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:53.300
<v Speaker 5>So the fact that you would read this </v>
<v Speaker 5>book and I read this one hour about what</v>

1970
01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:54.980
<v Speaker 5>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the hell do you want to,</v>

1971
01:26:54.981 --> 01:26:58.160
<v Speaker 5>let's keep it already John Sattler for </v>
<v Speaker 5>politics and be done with it.</v>

1972
01:26:58.190 --> 01:27:03.190
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so today in a lot of Europe you go </v>

1973
01:27:03.190 --> 01:27:03.770
<v Speaker 5>to churches and they are a tourist </v>
<v Speaker 5>attraction and so,</v>

1974
01:27:03.771 --> 01:27:08.771
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the countryside now people are still </v>

1975
01:27:08.771 --> 01:27:10.631
<v Speaker 5>into it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in most of the cte seats they read </v>

1976
01:27:10.631 --> 01:27:13.690
<v Speaker 5>our knocked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most people don't go us whole different </v>

1977
01:27:13.690 --> 01:27:17.681
<v Speaker 5>game I think is the only modern </v>
<v Speaker 5>industrialized country where there's </v>

1978
01:27:17.681 --> 01:27:20.750
<v Speaker 5>these levels of insane embark on their </v>
<v Speaker 5>religion.</v>

1979
01:27:20.751 --> 01:27:25.751
<v Speaker 5>I mean today there is no way that a good</v>
<v Speaker 5>Aha guy equal never even bother running </v>

1980
01:27:25.751 --> 01:27:29.861
<v Speaker 5>for president is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Has there ever been a time where an </v>

1981
01:27:29.861 --> 01:27:29.861
<v Speaker 5>atheist could have ran for president and</v>
<v Speaker 5>not anyone else?</v>

1982
01:27:29.861 --> 01:27:30.320
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never.</v>

1983
01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:35.370
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some guys where we are like Thomas </v>

1984
01:27:35.370 --> 01:27:39.340
<v Speaker 5>Jefferson or something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he basically 83rd the Bible by cutting </v>

1985
01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:40.730
<v Speaker 5>up all the stuff that he thought was </v>
<v Speaker 5>crap,</v>

1986
01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:43.100
<v Speaker 5>which was most of it and saving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1987
01:27:43.101 --> 01:27:45.310
<v Speaker 5>like he took out out of the gospels.</v>

1988
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:47.580
<v Speaker 5>He took out the virgin birth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the miracles,</v>

1989
01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:52.600
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of the stuff that he knew his mind </v>

1990
01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:53.090
<v Speaker 5>was a bunch of crap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He saved up the pirates of Jesus that he</v>

1991
01:27:53.091 --> 01:27:55.880
<v Speaker 5>likes saying he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a sweet guy.</v>

1992
01:27:55.881 --> 01:27:58.550
<v Speaker 5>He tells you to be nice to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that part where we keep it up.</v>

1993
01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:02.210
<v Speaker 5>Art and that became the Jefferson Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said he said averse.</v>

1994
01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.180
<v Speaker 5>How long was his Bible?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like 50 patients bridge much.</v>

1995
01:28:05.181 --> 01:28:10.181
<v Speaker 5>But I don't remember how long ago it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>about and what a cocky dude.</v>

1996
01:28:10.761 --> 01:28:11.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Things.</v>

1997
01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:16.430
<v Speaker 5>But at the same time he was a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1998
01:28:16.431 --> 01:28:19.440
<v Speaker 5>it's probably a dick at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1999
01:28:19.490 --> 01:28:20.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on man.</v>

2000
01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.430
<v Speaker 5>You can't edit that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know what,</v>

2001
01:28:22.431 --> 01:28:25.640
<v Speaker 5>you don't get to edit it by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fact is everybody does.</v>

2002
01:28:26.150 --> 01:28:27.740
<v Speaker 5>They just don't tell you because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2003
01:28:27.741 --> 01:28:32.741
<v Speaker 5>everybody highlights the power day like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they completely keep on the parts </v>

2004
01:28:32.741 --> 01:28:33.860
<v Speaker 5>they don't like and so they come up with</v>
<v Speaker 5>their own thing anyway.</v>

2005
01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:35.980
<v Speaker 5>At least the guy who had the guts to </v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

2006
01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:38.750
<v Speaker 5>this is exactly what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What everybody else does it,</v>

2007
01:28:38.751 --> 01:28:39.590
<v Speaker 5>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2008
01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:41.550
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's always so much contradiction.</v>

2009
01:28:41.570 --> 01:28:43.700
<v Speaker 5>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about religious tattoos?</v>

2010
01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:51.020
<v Speaker 5>That's like strictly prohibited.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that's crazy,</v>

2011
01:28:51.021 --> 01:28:51.980
<v Speaker 5>but when the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2012
01:28:51.981 --> 01:28:53.450
<v Speaker 5>you'll get the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll get that.</v>

2013
01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:54.590
<v Speaker 5>In fact that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2014
01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:57.440
<v Speaker 5>a lot of Jewish people know what that </v>
<v Speaker 5>tool is not on the,</v>

2015
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:59.320
<v Speaker 5>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2016
01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 5>you get all the sinks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a white Jewish</v>

2017
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.800
<v Speaker 1>girls with tattoos at hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she's a gambler.</v>

2018
01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:08.710
<v Speaker 5>Just rolling that dice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's one that I threw in there that's</v>

2019
01:29:08.711 --> 01:29:09.740
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2020
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:11.020
<v Speaker 5>what did I call that one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2021
01:29:11.050 --> 01:29:16.050
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's titled the Christian </v>

2022
01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:17.921
<v Speaker 5>fundamentalist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would love to introduce you to my pet </v>

2023
01:29:17.921 --> 01:29:20.911
<v Speaker 5>King Cobra.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's actually a reason for that </v>

2024
01:29:20.911 --> 01:29:23.730
<v Speaker 5>because the in the gospels and there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>the story of Jesus telling you that if </v>

2025
01:29:23.730 --> 01:29:25.540
<v Speaker 5>you really have faith in him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you are a pedestrian,</v>

2026
01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:30.150
<v Speaker 5>Ndi fade and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could take boys on snakes,</v>

2027
01:29:30.190 --> 01:29:32.800
<v Speaker 5>could our soul to you and bite you and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll be totally fine.</v>

2028
01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:34.930
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

2029
01:29:35.170 --> 01:29:40.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that's what Jesus is seen and </v>

2030
01:29:40.170 --> 01:29:40.170
<v Speaker 5>different diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you guys believe,</v>

2031
01:29:40.170 --> 01:29:40.290
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me.</v>

2032
01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:45.300
<v Speaker 5>But in Gavin the snakes that savvy to </v>
<v Speaker 5>try and it's like one of two things are </v>

2033
01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:49.261
<v Speaker 5>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Either you know that the stuff you </v>

2034
01:29:49.261 --> 01:29:53.011
<v Speaker 5>believe in is crap and you don't really </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe it or you know that you are.</v>

2035
01:29:53.710 --> 01:29:55.330
<v Speaker 5>That there are no good Christians </v>
<v Speaker 5>because.</v>

2036
01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:57.250
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not the way it works today.</v>

2037
01:29:57.251 --> 01:30:02.251
<v Speaker 5>I don't care how much faith you have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like nobody can survive taking the </v>

2038
01:30:02.251 --> 01:30:06.450
<v Speaker 5>boys on our staff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on our or your Alameda deadline in the </v>

2039
01:30:06.450 --> 01:30:07.500
<v Speaker 5>Bible is crap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was in,</v>

2040
01:30:07.650 --> 01:30:09.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was booting there by somebody else,</v>

2041
01:30:09.671 --> 01:30:14.671
<v Speaker 5>but he's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In which case it doesn't exactly say </v>

2042
01:30:14.671 --> 01:30:15.460
<v Speaker 5>great things about the reliability of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing,</v>

2043
01:30:15.461 --> 01:30:16.930
<v Speaker 5>but it's like there's no getting out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2044
01:30:16.931 --> 01:30:19.150
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you get out of that?</v>

2045
01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:19.690
<v Speaker 5>You don't know.</v>

2046
01:30:20.230 --> 01:30:25.230
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with a guy recently</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was telling me that there are </v>

2047
01:30:25.230 --> 01:30:27.400
<v Speaker 1>people that believe so much that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can drink poison and not die.</v>

2048
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.050
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>

2049
01:30:29.051 --> 01:30:30.760
<v Speaker 1>what a crazy conversation we're having </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2050
01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:32.880
<v Speaker 1>I doubt that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2051
01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.870
<v Speaker 1>have you seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not scientific.</v>

2052
01:30:34.871 --> 01:30:36.730
<v Speaker 1>This is not something that's been proven</v>
<v Speaker 1>by studies.</v>

2053
01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Like does someone say that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely believe if someone can take </v>

2054
01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:41.880
<v Speaker 1>poison and not die because their belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>in themselves,</v>

2055
01:30:42.330 --> 01:30:46.180
<v Speaker 1>there's only one way to tell homie </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my take that poison.</v>

2056
01:30:46.210 --> 01:30:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2057
01:30:46.541 --> 01:30:49.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying he's not through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's try convinced me aim.</v>

2058
01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:52.880
<v Speaker 1>If you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have $0</v>

2059
01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:58.020
<v Speaker 5>people following and you'll be the </v>
<v Speaker 5>greatest asset to Christianity ever </v>

2060
01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:01.540
<v Speaker 5>because you made a millions converts and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're actually to tell the defendant.</v>

2061
01:31:01.541 --> 01:31:03.310
<v Speaker 5>Some of these guys really are serious </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

2062

2065
01:31:15.330 --> 01:31:15.330
<v Speaker 5>tradition of a snake handlers that they </v>

<v Speaker 5>It's there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's test it.</v>

2078
01:31:39.550 --> 01:31:42.240
<v Speaker 5>That just led just that way.</v>

2079
01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:45.010
<v Speaker 1>People need something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2080
01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:47.770
<v Speaker 1>They're always going to need something </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're going to need,</v>

2081
01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:50.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he did a path.</v>

2083
01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:58.820
<v Speaker 1>They need someone that just chop out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brush for them and point them in the </v>

2084
01:31:58.820 --> 01:31:59.680
<v Speaker 1>right direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's Christianity,</v>

2085
01:31:59.681 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 1>whether it's</v>

2086
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:05.040
<v Speaker 5>atheism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've met atheists that might as well </v>

2087
01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:05.040
<v Speaker 5>have been religious stuff that they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

2088
01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:08.890
<v Speaker 5>they're so anti religion that there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

2089
01:32:08.891 --> 01:32:13.891
<v Speaker 5>it's a religion in and of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a chapter that I was supposed to </v>

2090
01:32:13.891 --> 01:32:17.431
<v Speaker 5>go in the book that was basically saying</v>
<v Speaker 5>that eight k stand hardcore </v>

2091
01:32:17.431 --> 01:32:21.151
<v Speaker 5>fundamentalist are doing separated at </v>
<v Speaker 5>birth because they are both based on </v>

2092
01:32:21.151 --> 01:32:23.260
<v Speaker 5>certainty on how the universe works and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all of that,</v>

2093
01:32:23.261 --> 01:32:26.620
<v Speaker 5>but then my publisher decided,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did you already are offending people,</v>

2094
01:32:26.621 --> 01:32:29.200
<v Speaker 5>have 7 million different religions you </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to have.</v>

2095
01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.530
<v Speaker 5>We want to sell some books about us </v>
<v Speaker 5>keeping the eight.</v>

2096
01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:36.560
<v Speaker 5>This chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's when they both have in common is </v>

2097
01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.821
<v Speaker 5>they would all shit their pants if they </v>
<v Speaker 5>saw an alien that I think everybody </v>

2098
01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:44.800
<v Speaker 5>that's the trump card is the aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If a real fucking alien battleship,</v>

2099
01:32:44.801 --> 01:32:46.570
<v Speaker 5>like all these stupid movies that keep </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming out,</v>

2100
01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:49.450

<v Speaker 5>where it comes out of the ocean and then</v>

<v Speaker 5>they fucking go to or the American </v>
<v Speaker 5>military to shoot cannons at this </v>

<v Speaker 5>that pops out of the ocean.</v>

2103
01:32:58.150 --> 01:33:00.400
<v Speaker 5>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I missed the jewel of cinematography.</v>

2105
01:33:05.170 --> 01:33:07.960
<v Speaker 5>but whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like is a never ending theme.</v>

2106
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:13.030
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's never anything with someone way </v>

2107

<v Speaker 5>Buildings explode.</v>

2109
01:33:17.231 --> 01:33:22.231
<v Speaker 5>It's like a standard vision of a Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 5>adult when nobody could do are all these</v>

01:33:23.411 --> 01:33:25.810
<v Speaker 5>weird stuff going on with my body and </v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody could figure it out.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He just makes me like that,</v>

2112

<v Speaker 5>of 2012 and who knows whether they are </v>

<v Speaker 5>and why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy fixed it.</v>

2128
01:34:17.050 --> 01:34:19.060
<v Speaker 5>He told me her back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could puncture,</v>

2129
01:34:19.061 --> 01:34:24.061
<v Speaker 5>we'll fix your back and then you have an</v>
<v Speaker 5>infection that will give you the herbs </v>

2130

<v Speaker 5>and you'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2131
01:34:24.061 --> 01:34:24.580
<v Speaker 5>infection.</v>

2132
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:25.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no idea.</v>

2133
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:27.520
<v Speaker 5>But he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this stuff will magically,</v>

2134
01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:29.710
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll get rid of it real up.</v>

2135
01:34:29.770 --> 01:34:33.070
<v Speaker 5>Sure enough because I mean they did at </v>
<v Speaker 5>Geyser.</v>

2136
01:34:33.071 --> 01:34:38.071
<v Speaker 5>I dad like seven gazillion tests than </v>
<v Speaker 5>from Mris to rx tool evidencing you name</v>

2137

2138
01:34:44.251 --> 01:34:44.251
<v Speaker 5>related for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2139
01:34:44.251 --> 01:34:47.750
<v Speaker 5>but stress can cause real stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not just um,</v>

2140
01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:51.160
<v Speaker 5>psychosomatic psychosomatics really fuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>you up in specific ways.</v>

2141
01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:52.360
<v Speaker 5>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2142
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:53.860
<v Speaker 5>he was thrusted related,</v>
<v Speaker 5>embodied,</v>

2143
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 5>like who knows specifically what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody figure it out.</v>

2144
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:03.130
<v Speaker 1>And then the crazy Chinese guy safe me </v>
<v Speaker 1>was telling me about Ufo was the whole </v>

2145
01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:07.181
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I mean about while he </v>

2146
01:35:07.181 --> 01:35:07.181
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while he was fixing it,</v>

2147
01:35:07.181 --> 01:35:08.390
<v Speaker 1>he telling you about your phone still </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked up,</v>

2148
01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:13.400
<v Speaker 1>so thought that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's almost like eliminating the </v>

2149
01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:13.400
<v Speaker 1>placebo effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Ufo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking amazing idea for them.</v>

2153
01:35:22.530 --> 01:35:23.270
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2154
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:28.330
<v Speaker 1>it's so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that they're out there and that </v>

2155
01:35:28.330 --> 01:35:31.361
<v Speaker 1>they're watching and they're coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to need to know what they </v>

2156
01:35:31.361 --> 01:35:31.370
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your friends or their key Leo.</v>

2157
01:35:31.650 --> 01:35:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2158
01:35:34.161 --> 01:35:35.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2159
01:35:35.091 --> 01:35:35.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2160
01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that they're not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

2161
01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:40.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that there's not really a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy in the clouds.</v>

2162
01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:44.150
<v Speaker 1>It's just I've not seen anything.</v>

2163
01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:47.000
<v Speaker 1>Anything compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

2164
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2165
01:35:47.481 --> 01:35:51.830
<v Speaker 1>I leave it open that it would come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not seeing anything compelling,</v>

2166
01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:53.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the birth of a child.</v>

2167
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:59.410
<v Speaker 1>That's not what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about Ufo as you fuckhead </v>

2168
01:35:59.410 --> 01:36:02.550
<v Speaker 1>just tuned out and tune back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took my words completely out of context,</v>

2169
01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:06.560
<v Speaker 1>how dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if the aliens did land,</v>

2170
01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:08.930
<v Speaker 1>that would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the end of everything.</v>

2171
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:11.480
<v Speaker 1>If there was something way smarter than </v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

2172
01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:13.690
<v Speaker 1>we would just have to give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2173
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:15.970
<v Speaker 1>We would have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would,</v>

2174
01:36:16.650 --> 01:36:20.150
<v Speaker 1>we would be so stunned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when cults were just rise up.</v>

2175
01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:21.950
<v Speaker 1>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a dark moment.</v>

2176
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:25.610
<v Speaker 1>If it's a real alien culture did come </v>
<v Speaker 1>here for another planet,</v>

2177
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would really get frantic.</v>

2178
01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:33.010
<v Speaker 1>That's when people would really like </v>
<v Speaker 1>some stock stock up on food and 50 </v>

2179
01:36:33.010 --> 01:36:33.160
<v Speaker 1>caliber guns and what?</v>

2180
01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:34.650
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

2181
01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are dealing with something that's</v>

2182
01:36:36.591 --> 01:36:41.591
<v Speaker 1>so much more powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much so it's like you think it's </v>

2183
01:36:41.591 --> 01:36:46.031
<v Speaker 1>possible for a society to get smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to be able to travel through </v>

2184
01:36:46.031 --> 01:36:48.791
<v Speaker 1>space and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go and fuck with other people or </v>

2185
01:36:48.791 --> 01:36:48.791
<v Speaker 1>another planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2186
01:36:48.791 --> 01:36:50.070
<v Speaker 1>look at the stuff we do today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If somebody asked you if he was possible</v>

2187
01:36:50.130 --> 01:36:51.800
<v Speaker 1>50 or so ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like magic.</v>

2188
01:36:51.801 --> 01:36:56.801
<v Speaker 1>I of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're always like one fuck up away </v>

2189
01:36:56.801 --> 01:36:58.340
<v Speaker 1>from blowing each other sky high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one doesn't rule.</v>

2190
01:36:58.341 --> 01:37:00.230
<v Speaker 1>The other doesn't overlap with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

2191
01:37:00.231 --> 01:37:05.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you can be incredibly </v>

2192
01:37:05.231 --> 01:37:07.250
<v Speaker 1>smart and come up with all these awesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff doesn't mean you are wise enough </v>

2193
01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:08.100
<v Speaker 1>to deal with data and not fuck ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2194
01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:12.470
<v Speaker 1>which is humanity right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is humanity in a nutshell.</v>

2195
01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be such a fucking shame if we </v>

2196
01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:18.320
<v Speaker 1>library of Alexandria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing.</v>

2197
01:37:18.730 --> 01:37:21.470
<v Speaker 1>It just went boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just torch this whole civilization.</v>

2198
01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:24.240
<v Speaker 1>And we had to really start from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2199
01:37:24.241 --> 01:37:26.360
<v Speaker 1>And I would see as little in my day I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

2200
01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:29.430
<v Speaker 1>well that is the one sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

2201
01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:34.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say justification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the one sort of argument for having </v>

2202
01:37:34.450 --> 01:37:37.421
<v Speaker 1>one powerful military that dominates the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world as I go to is that by </v>

2203
01:37:37.421 --> 01:37:41.351
<v Speaker 1>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least they keep everybody else from </v>

2204
01:37:41.351 --> 01:37:44.350
<v Speaker 1>blowing everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep keep your military from growing to </v>

2205
01:37:44.350 --> 01:37:46.760
<v Speaker 1>the point where you were able to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same decisions that we can make.</v>

2206
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.280
<v Speaker 1>We don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2207
01:37:48.610 --> 01:37:53.610
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an argument and then I guess if </v>

2208
01:37:53.610 --> 01:37:53.660
<v Speaker 1>you look at the statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what people are like,</v>

2209
01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:58.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the potential for people to behave </v>

2210
01:37:58.720 --> 01:37:58.720
<v Speaker 1>as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2211
01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:01.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big fan of the US government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I compare it to a lot of,</v>

2212
01:38:01.130 --> 01:38:06.130
<v Speaker 1>there are a bunch of places and </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments that I would like about </v>

2213
01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:06.130
<v Speaker 1>turning.</v>

2214
01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:06.130
<v Speaker 1>There are many others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2215
01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ giving me George Bush </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2216
01:38:07.291 --> 01:38:11.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just give me the worse could happen.</v>

2217
01:38:11.050 --> 01:38:16.050
<v Speaker 1>US ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the still I like it better than the </v>

2218
01:38:16.050 --> 01:38:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2219
01:38:16.050 --> 01:38:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no kidding,</v>

2220
01:38:16.050 --> 01:38:16.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny,</v>

2221
01:38:16.730 --> 01:38:21.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's amazing the spectrum of </v>

2222
01:38:21.730 --> 01:38:24.540
<v Speaker 1>different sorts of regimes that exist at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time like what's going on right</v>

2223
01:38:24.541 --> 01:38:29.541
<v Speaker 1>now in Syria and while you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americas are complaining about the </v>

2224
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:36.590
<v Speaker 1>National Defense Authorization Act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which takes away a lot of civil </v>

2225
01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:37.611
<v Speaker 1>liberties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so nothing compared to what the fuck is </v>

2226
01:38:37.611 --> 01:38:40.131
<v Speaker 1>going on in the Middle East and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>riots of Arabs Arab spring and what's </v>

2227
01:38:40.131 --> 01:38:42.770
<v Speaker 1>going on right now in Egypt and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power void in Iraq.</v>

2228
01:38:42.771 --> 01:38:47.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's parts of the world right now </v>

2229
01:38:47.771 --> 01:38:48.990
<v Speaker 1>that are fa a fucked up a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot,</v>

2230
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we as Americans can barely even </v>

2231
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:54.000
<v Speaker 1>wrap our heads around that.</v>

2232
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:54.000
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even seem real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

2233
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.290
<v Speaker 1>because unless you leave it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

2234
01:38:55.470 --> 01:39:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something you see on tv for 30 </v>

2235
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.470
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean shit.</v>

2236
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:01.470
<v Speaker 1>That's like the one argument for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful military right there.</v>

2237
01:39:01.930 --> 01:39:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Fucking press world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2238
01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:04.660
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2239
01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:07.590
<v Speaker 1>people always say that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been accused of being a liberal.</v>

2240
01:39:07.591 --> 01:39:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I've been accused of being anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>military,</v>

2241
01:39:09.331 --> 01:39:14.331
<v Speaker 1>which I'm absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always anti the people that are </v>

2242
01:39:14.331 --> 01:39:14.331
<v Speaker 1>pointing the military in certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>directions.</v>

2243
01:39:14.331 --> 01:39:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm anti.</v>

2244
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anti a lot of,</v>

2245
01:39:17.670 --> 01:39:20.190
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the people's decisions at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very top of the heap.</v>

2246
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:22.920
<v Speaker 1>But as far as like having a military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2247
01:39:22.921 --> 01:39:25.300
<v Speaker 1>You better fucking better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2248
01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:27.030
<v Speaker 1>It's the rest of the world does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2249
01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to have a military.</v>

2250
01:39:28.831 --> 01:39:33.831
<v Speaker 1>It's very good to keep an eye on all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these crazy assholes all over the world </v>

2251
01:39:33.831 --> 01:39:35.430
<v Speaker 1>too because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people.</v>

2252
01:39:35.490 --> 01:39:40.490
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People then at state good overlap with </v>

2253
01:39:40.490 --> 01:39:41.430
<v Speaker 1>the every single about the commentary is</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing and wonderful and then when they</v>

2254
01:39:41.431 --> 01:39:45.020
<v Speaker 1>find out that it's not all amazing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful that some bad shit happened,</v>

2255
01:39:45.021 --> 01:39:50.021
<v Speaker 1>they go to the extreme opposite and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like every scene that some Eddy County </v>

2256
01:39:50.021 --> 01:39:50.021
<v Speaker 1>is horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

2257
01:39:50.021 --> 01:39:51.810
<v Speaker 1>and the US is responsible for every </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene that's evil in the world.</v>

2258
01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:52.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2259
01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:55.470
<v Speaker 1>that's not the more complicated than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2260
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.390
<v Speaker 1>It's very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very quickly.</v>

2261
01:39:57.540 --> 01:40:02.540
<v Speaker 1>The economy in and of itself is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated and a lot of laws that are </v>

2262
01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:05.721
<v Speaker 1>in place are very complicated and one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reasons why they're in places </v>

2263
01:40:05.721 --> 01:40:05.730
<v Speaker 1>because getting rid of laws gets rid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>

2264
01:40:05.731 --> 01:40:10.050
<v Speaker 1>We're police officers don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the big problems with drug</v>

2265
01:40:10.051 --> 01:40:11.400
<v Speaker 1>enforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2266
01:40:11.410 --> 01:40:13.380
<v Speaker 1>drug enforcement as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a business,</v>

2267
01:40:13.381 --> 01:40:18.381
<v Speaker 1>you know the Drug Enforcement Agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a business drug and forcing is a </v>

2268
01:40:18.381 --> 01:40:19.500
<v Speaker 1>business that you're spending money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs are created.</v>

2269
01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:21.630
<v Speaker 1>This is how ridiculous it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Florida,</v>

2270
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:24.580
<v Speaker 1>they had people that were pretending to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be high school students are,</v>

2271
01:40:24.690 --> 01:40:26.340
<v Speaker 1>you know the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read it.</v>

2272
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:31.430
<v Speaker 1>I think I tweeted it recently and I mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been more than one case of </v>

2273
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:32.070
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them,</v>

2274
01:40:32.071 --> 01:40:37.071
<v Speaker 1>they arrested 28 kids and another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman was hot and she was 25 and </v>

2275
01:40:37.071 --> 01:40:41.130
<v Speaker 1>she was flirting with 15 year old boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They became facebook friends.</v>

2276
01:40:41.131 --> 01:40:43.350
<v Speaker 1>They were texting each other and she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>flirting with him,</v>

2277
01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:45.690
<v Speaker 1>asking him to get her weed so he got her</v>
<v Speaker 1>weed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>want to take money for it.</v>

2280
01:40:51.001 --> 01:40:56.001
<v Speaker 1>He said it was a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't give him money and then </v>

2281
01:40:56.001 --> 01:40:56.001
<v Speaker 1>they arrest him and now they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>charge him with fucking,</v>

2282
01:40:56.001 --> 01:41:00.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a potential nine years in jail or </v>

2283
01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:00.900
<v Speaker 1>something crazy.</v>

2284
01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:00.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2285
01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:04.750
<v Speaker 1>what an asshole thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a crazy ridiculous asshole thing to</v>

2286
01:41:04.751 --> 01:41:09.751
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that goes back to that point is </v>

2287
01:41:09.751 --> 01:41:11.641
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck do people feel the need to </v>

2288
01:41:11.641 --> 01:41:12.540
<v Speaker 1>tell other people how to live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't like it.</v>

2289
01:41:12.670 --> 01:41:14.960
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a business that there's a job.</v>

2290
01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:17.170
<v Speaker 1>There's jobs that were created in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sting,</v>

2291
01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:18.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they created this thing,</v>

2292
01:41:18.621 --> 01:41:23.621
<v Speaker 1>they went into high school and they got </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids to sell them weed and they did it </v>

2293
01:41:23.621 --> 01:41:26.971
<v Speaker 1>in such a sneaky fucked up way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that a 25 year old woman could </v>

2294
01:41:26.971 --> 01:41:31.111
<v Speaker 1>ever have a position where she talks a </v>
<v Speaker 1>boy thing and have that boy responsible </v>

2295
01:41:32.441 --> 01:41:33.200
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2296
01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:38.390
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a boy and a 15 year old boy has no idea </v>

2297
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:41.380
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just sees tents and skin and lips and</v>

2298
01:41:41.381 --> 01:41:46.381
<v Speaker 1>she's touching his hand and his dick is </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard and he can't even believe she's </v>

2299
01:41:46.381 --> 01:41:46.381
<v Speaker 1>talking to him.</v>

2300
01:41:46.381 --> 01:41:47.770
<v Speaker 1>He can't even believe she's talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2301
01:41:47.771 --> 01:41:49.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll get you weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get you whatever the fuck you want.</v>

2302
01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:53.500
<v Speaker 1>He can't believe she's so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She looks like a woman because she has a</v>

2303
01:41:53.501 --> 01:41:56.560
<v Speaker 1>moment that fucking bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally cheating.</v>

2304
01:41:56.830 --> 01:41:59.720
<v Speaker 1>She's not 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not a fellow high school student.</v>

2305
01:41:59.721 --> 01:42:02.070
<v Speaker 1>She's a 25 year old cop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2306
01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How ridiculous.</v>

2307
01:42:04.811 --> 01:42:06.430
<v Speaker 1>So that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I got it.</v>

2308
01:42:06.431 --> 01:42:08.440
<v Speaker 1>There are jobs in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

2309
01:42:08.650 --> 01:42:12.310
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately it's possible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way to like they don't want</v>

2310
01:42:12.311 --> 01:42:14.640
<v Speaker 1>to get shot busting on a meth lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in there.</v>

2311
01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Labs are hard to break into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there enough real estate to going </v>

2312
01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:21.730
<v Speaker 1>on where people could work to solve real</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems going on?</v>

2313
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would hope you would hope,</v>

2314
01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:26.200
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2315
01:42:26.201 --> 01:42:31.201
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's that logical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a money grab and I think </v>

2316
01:42:31.201 --> 01:42:34.321
<v Speaker 1>people go where the money is and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is money right now in enforcing their </v>

2317
01:42:34.321 --> 01:42:34.690
<v Speaker 1>current drug laws.</v>

2318
01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:37.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of jobs that would be lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we just said,</v>

2319
01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:38.500
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pot's legal,</v>

2320
01:42:38.501 --> 01:42:43.501
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how many fucking people are </v>

2321
01:42:43.501 --> 01:42:43.501
<v Speaker 1>going to be out of jobs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

2322
01:42:43.501 --> 01:42:43.501
<v Speaker 1>that's a real issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2323
01:42:43.501 --> 01:42:44.980
<v Speaker 1>and it's something that should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrected to.</v>

2324
01:42:44.981 --> 01:42:48.280
<v Speaker 1>There should be a bill that addresses </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as well and says,</v>

2325
01:42:48.281 --> 01:42:53.281
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to replace these drug </v>

2326
01:42:53.281 --> 01:42:53.281
<v Speaker 1>enforcement jobs with jobs where they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

2327
01:42:53.290 --> 01:42:54.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something more,</v>

2328
01:42:55.450 --> 01:42:56.560
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more helpful,</v>

2329
01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:58.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2330
01:42:58.870 --> 01:43:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Border Security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2331
01:43:02.170 --> 01:43:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that makes more sense.</v>

2332
01:43:04.410 --> 01:43:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Board is courteous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible example,</v>

2333
01:43:06.370 --> 01:43:11.370
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put them in torpedoes or submarines </v>

2334
01:43:11.370 --> 01:43:13.870
<v Speaker 1>rather get to patrol the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are just,</v>

2335
01:43:13.990 --> 01:43:15.910
<v Speaker 1>these aren't really well thought out </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

2336
01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:18.580
<v Speaker 1>but if you were trying to come up with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good bill,</v>

2337
01:43:18.581 --> 01:43:21.490
<v Speaker 1>a good bill would be make marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal,</v>

2338
01:43:21.550 --> 01:43:26.550
<v Speaker 1>make it a readily available and sellable</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then take the jobs will be lost and </v>

2339
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Drug Enforcement and put them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something positive.</v>

2340
01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:29.140
<v Speaker 1>So whatever it could be forestry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2341
01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:32.290
<v Speaker 1>whatever jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the issue would be those people</v>

2342
01:43:32.291 --> 01:43:33.910
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be qualified for those jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how,</v>

2343
01:43:34.090 --> 01:43:39.090
<v Speaker 1>how do those people benefit from it are </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people are just going to be shit </v>

2344
01:43:39.090 --> 01:43:39.090
<v Speaker 1>out of luck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not over the whole new career.</v>

2345
01:43:39.090 --> 01:43:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Not only jobs that require you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2346
01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:43.180
<v Speaker 1>study for 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2347
01:43:43.181 --> 01:43:48.181
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it could be a period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>training where they still get money as </v>

2348
01:43:48.181 --> 01:43:50.620
<v Speaker 1>they are getting trained for the viewer </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Drug Enforcement for like 25 years,</v>

2349
01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:53.420
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of guys are right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

2350
01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:58.720
<v Speaker 1>all of the sudden it's banished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinda sucks for them and that's not </v>

2351
01:43:58.881 --> 01:44:01.070
<v Speaker 1>their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not your fault when you a young cop</v>

2352
01:44:01.071 --> 01:44:02.720
<v Speaker 1>and you think that this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2353
01:44:02.721 --> 01:44:03.920
<v Speaker 1>it's the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what it is,</v>

2354
01:44:03.921 --> 01:44:06.200
<v Speaker 1>but it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost not your fault.</v>

2355
01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:06.650
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2356
01:44:06.651 --> 01:44:09.510
<v Speaker 1>you're suckered into doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually a moral.</v>

2357
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:13.130
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like it's okay because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's behind the wall,</v>

2358
01:44:13.131 --> 01:44:15.200
<v Speaker 1>have something written down on paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>

2359
01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:17.660
<v Speaker 1>but the reality of it is it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking a moral.</v>

2360
01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:18.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

2361
01:44:18.561 --> 01:44:21.740
<v Speaker 1>when you're locking a kid up in a cage </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you caught them with some plants</v>

2362
01:44:21.741 --> 01:44:24.500
<v Speaker 1>or some fungus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely an APP.</v>

2363
01:44:25.090 --> 01:44:30.090
<v Speaker 1>It's reprehensible and everyone knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>that inherently they know it inside and </v>

2364
01:44:30.090 --> 01:44:30.470
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fooling yourself.</v>

2365
01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:33.640
<v Speaker 1>It's really that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2366
01:44:33.810 --> 01:44:38.810
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing that we still have to have </v>

2367
01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:41.051
<v Speaker 1>these conversations and not only that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do because if you look at the </v>

2368
01:44:41.051 --> 01:44:41.051
<v Speaker 1>political scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>

2369
01:44:41.051 --> 01:44:42.860
<v Speaker 1>not Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not Democrats.</v>

2370
01:44:42.861 --> 01:44:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was a shot at winning,</v>

2371
01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:50.380
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would even bring up these topics </v>

2372
01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:50.380
<v Speaker 1>because it's political suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2373
01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:51.710
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are soft on their ad.</v>

2374
01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:54.630
<v Speaker 1>You really want the roads to be shooting</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

2375
01:44:54.631 --> 01:44:56.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the problem is those dangerous</v>

2376
01:44:56.961 --> 01:44:57.560
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2377
01:44:57.570 --> 01:45:02.570
<v Speaker 1>those problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those drugs that fucking socked and we </v>

2378
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:03.600
<v Speaker 1>need to like really get it out there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids like don't fuck with heroin.</v>

2379
01:45:03.601 --> 01:45:08.601
<v Speaker 1>I don't fuck with math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fuck with all these dangerous </v>

2380
01:45:08.601 --> 01:45:08.601
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2381
01:45:08.601 --> 01:45:08.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

2382
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:11.600
<v Speaker 1>if things were legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if cocaine was legal,</v>

2383
01:45:11.630 --> 01:45:16.630
<v Speaker 1>you would actually buy real cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would go to a pharmacy or whatever </v>

2384
01:45:16.630 --> 01:45:19.070
<v Speaker 1>the fuck you would buy it if it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal and goodbye real cocaine,</v>

2385
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:21.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting real cocaine.</v>

2386
01:45:21.471 --> 01:45:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Now you're getting real cocaine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>joey has bought and chopped up and you,</v>

2387
01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:29.920
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what you're getting of Myrica </v>

2388
01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2389
01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Albert Hoffman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who will create the less day.</v>

2390
01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:33.740
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>established me was,</v>

2391
01:45:33.741 --> 01:45:34.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2392
01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:39.360
<v Speaker 1>most of the stuff that goes for lsd </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the word is not a name because </v>

2393
01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:39.770
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I make,</v>

2394
01:45:39.771 --> 01:45:44.771
<v Speaker 1>it uses certain compounds that are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>rare that there's no way that he could </v>

2395
01:45:44.771 --> 01:45:45.850
<v Speaker 1>support such mantra production.</v>

2396
01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:47.630
<v Speaker 1>They're just teasing them up over that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2397
01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say whatever they sell out there,</v>

2398
01:45:50.091 --> 01:45:51.740
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what the holidays,</v>

2399
01:45:51.810 --> 01:45:55.220
<v Speaker 1>but he's served on these now my stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he argue a dang.</v>

2400
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's through a window,</v>

2401
01:45:56.810 --> 01:46:00.770
<v Speaker 1>but he argued at ea staff would give you</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of hold the benefits of lsd without</v>

2402
01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:05.771
<v Speaker 1>all the crap from St Louis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm so treat us to lsd though,</v>

2403
01:46:05.931 --> 01:46:10.931
<v Speaker 1>is still giving you the same benefits as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that he produces was just </v>

2404
01:46:10.931 --> 01:46:10.931
<v Speaker 1>wasn't as taxing on the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2405
01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:12.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2406
01:46:12.591 --> 01:46:15.890
<v Speaker 1>They made that shit illegal too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>

2407
01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:20.950
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually you see these guys like a </v>

2408
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Suisse cammies to sylvere was all doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>very now he's been dead for awhile.</v>

2409
01:46:22.930 --> 01:46:24.320
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's uh,</v>

2410
01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.800
<v Speaker 1>and he was originally looking for a cure</v>
<v Speaker 1>for headache.</v>

2411
01:46:28.030 --> 01:46:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Like he was working on a headache pill </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he came up with LSD.</v>

2412
01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:36.920
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty fun to come up with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not even realize it took it </v>

2413
01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:40.720
<v Speaker 1>accidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It in his skin and it was riding </v>

2414
01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:40.720
<v Speaker 1>home on his bike and just tripping his </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking balls off.</v>

2415
01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not knowing what he did,</v>

2416
01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:46.910
<v Speaker 1>they had no idea what the dosage was </v>
<v Speaker 1>back then because lsd like the,</v>

2417
01:46:46.911 --> 01:46:51.911
<v Speaker 1>the dosage to body ratio has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to an ant demolishing the </v>

2418
01:46:52.410 --> 01:46:57.410
<v Speaker 1>empire state building in 30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like literally like that's how powerful </v>

2419
01:46:58.091 --> 01:47:01.530
<v Speaker 1>like a little tiny drop of this shit is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know that man.</v>

2420
01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:04.050
<v Speaker 1>He probably was drinking glasses of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2421
01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Acid shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shots of acid.</v>

2422
01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I did that.</v>

2423
01:47:12.590 --> 01:47:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I met the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He say sat Sunday seem perfectly </v>

2424
01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.820
<v Speaker 1>coherent and logical steel and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2425
01:47:17.821 --> 01:47:19.400
<v Speaker 1>So who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was right.</v>

2426
01:47:19.530 --> 01:47:24.530
<v Speaker 1>There's a different look that those old </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that have done acid having their </v>

2427
01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:24.530
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

2428
01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:26.580
<v Speaker 1>It is a different look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2429
01:47:26.581 --> 01:47:27.450
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

2430
01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:32.540
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird thing that you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes we're talking to one of those </v>

2431
01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:35.481
<v Speaker 1>old asset dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might've seen some shit that's not </v>

2432
01:47:35.481 --> 01:47:35.810
<v Speaker 1>available anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2433
01:47:35.970 --> 01:47:39.300
<v Speaker 1>they might have seen some limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>production view of life.</v>

2434
01:47:39.301 --> 01:47:44.301
<v Speaker 1>Threw acid that acid in the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've loved to have seen what it </v>

2435
01:47:44.301 --> 01:47:45.420
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the flower child,</v>

2436
01:47:45.450 --> 01:47:48.120
<v Speaker 1>children of the San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early 19 sixties.</v>

2437
01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:53.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched that a hunter s Thompson </v>

2438
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:55.821
<v Speaker 1>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Gonzo the life and times I'm doctor </v>

2439
01:47:55.821 --> 01:47:59.790
<v Speaker 1>and it's a fucking fun documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that talks about </v>

2440
01:47:59.790 --> 01:48:03.441
<v Speaker 1>what's the utopia of the asset culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the early 19 sixties and San Francisco </v>

2441
01:48:03.441 --> 01:48:05.730
<v Speaker 1>and they show all these people running </v>
<v Speaker 1>around holding hands together,</v>

2442
01:48:05.731 --> 01:48:09.030
<v Speaker 1>tripping their balls off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really interesting,</v>

2443
01:48:09.031 --> 01:48:10.890
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was a,</v>

2444
01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:13.500
<v Speaker 1>that whole fucking part of the world.</v>

2445
01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:18.680
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't illegal yet and that whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the world was just blossoming </v>

2446
01:48:18.751 --> 01:48:23.751
<v Speaker 1>with all these new ideas and new music </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this new sort of wild psychedelic </v>

2447
01:48:24.031 --> 01:48:29.031
<v Speaker 1>culture was all like emanating out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this one place and they fucking threw </v>

2448
01:48:29.031 --> 01:48:29.320
<v Speaker 1>the water on it and squash that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2449
01:48:29.410 --> 01:48:31.710
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just list them to the music alone</v>

2450
01:48:31.711 --> 01:48:36.711
<v Speaker 1>and you asked them to what was in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties and then you switched to a six </v>

2451
01:48:36.711 --> 01:48:36.711
<v Speaker 1>days was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell just happened?</v>

2452
01:48:36.711 --> 01:48:41.601
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a whole other universe right there </v>

2453
01:48:41.601 --> 01:48:41.601
<v Speaker 1>as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2454
01:48:41.601 --> 01:48:44.661
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came up with some fucking </v>

2455
01:48:44.661 --> 01:48:44.700
<v Speaker 1>incredible shit and that makes it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

2456
01:48:44.701 --> 01:48:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it all happened in that area of</v>

2457
01:48:46.951 --> 01:48:48.370
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2458
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:51.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a widow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there a moment in time,</v>

2459
01:48:51.241 --> 01:48:53.610
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where if time travel is impossible,</v>

2460
01:48:53.611 --> 01:48:57.240
<v Speaker 1>but time recreationists they ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out a way to to recruit,</v>

2461
01:48:57.241 --> 01:49:02.241
<v Speaker 1>like we could just go in and peek that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know like remember those things that </v>

2462
01:49:02.241 --> 01:49:05.901
<v Speaker 1>you had when you were a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the view sliders and it was like a </v>

2463
01:49:05.901 --> 01:49:06.990
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur and you would click click and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be the next dinosaur.</v>

2464
01:49:07.590 --> 01:49:12.590
<v Speaker 1>If there was something you could put on </v>
<v Speaker 1>some goggles and just take a view as to </v>

2465
01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:15.270
<v Speaker 1>what life was like in a certain area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2466
01:49:15.271 --> 01:49:20.271
<v Speaker 1>$5 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like a fucking a security camera on </v>

2467
01:49:20.271 --> 01:49:24.441
<v Speaker 1>the wall 100 million years ago in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>jungle and watched dinosaurs rundown </v>

2468
01:49:24.441 --> 01:49:29.151
<v Speaker 1>Jack and things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that will be eventually </v>

2469
01:49:29.151 --> 01:49:29.830
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't it if you.</v>

2470
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can't have travel back in time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can have a view get.</v>

2471
01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:39.120
<v Speaker 1>That's where even if they just had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing computer simulation of what had </v>

2472
01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:41.530
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm good with.</v>

2473
01:49:42.630 --> 01:49:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck.</v>

2474
01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 1>We're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very lucky we were living in</v>

2475
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:53.040
<v Speaker 5>2012.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We would have been dead at any other </v>

2476
01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:53.650
<v Speaker 5>time in history where two week we </v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't have been able to deal with the</v>

2477
01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:58.800
<v Speaker 5>caveman era or the Babylonian Empire or </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Sumerian days when was coming.</v>

2478
01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:01.800
<v Speaker 5>That's supposed to take place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2479
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.160
<v Speaker 5>it's funny because he actually have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>use us a lot of history,</v>

2480
01:50:04.161 --> 01:50:05.960
<v Speaker 5>but then he argues that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2481
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:09.350
<v Speaker 5>he makes up a lot of graph of course </v>
<v Speaker 5>history.</v>

2482
01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:11.930
<v Speaker 5>Robert e Dot Howard did like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What did he use a lot?</v>

2483
01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:16.940
<v Speaker 5>If you look at these maps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are based on many of the cultures </v>

2484
01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:21.581
<v Speaker 5>see nice sort of fantasy wall or dire </v>
<v Speaker 5>based then on cultures that eventually </v>

2485
01:50:21.581 --> 01:50:22.970
<v Speaker 5>evolve in a real historical times that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we know of,</v>

2486
01:50:22.971 --> 01:50:24.980
<v Speaker 5>but he supposed to predate all this </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

2487
01:50:24.981 --> 01:50:28.310
<v Speaker 5>We know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he argues that there was Atlantis and</v>

2488
01:50:28.311 --> 01:50:33.311
<v Speaker 5>it's super powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's utilization and that collapsed and </v>

2489
01:50:33.311 --> 01:50:36.131
<v Speaker 5>the ward went into this hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 5>barbarianism and then civilizations who </v>

2490
01:50:36.131 --> 01:50:39.601
<v Speaker 5>are rising up again and that's when </v>
<v Speaker 5>Conan set scene and then the history we </v>

2491
01:50:39.601 --> 01:50:40.130
<v Speaker 5>know of that comes down the road.</v>

2492
01:50:40.850 --> 01:50:45.850
<v Speaker 5>So is it so appealing for men?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the guy goes around chopping </v>

2493
01:50:45.981 --> 01:50:48.500
<v Speaker 5>people set off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>grabbing all of the most beautiful women</v>

2494
01:50:48.501 --> 01:50:49.420
<v Speaker 5>in the land.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2495
01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:51.530
<v Speaker 5>do I need to go on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He drinks all the time.</v>

2496
01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:52.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

2497
01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:55.470
<v Speaker 5>that era like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the,</v>

2498
01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:56.560
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2499
01:50:56.650 --> 01:50:58.570
<v Speaker 5>not that arrow rather,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that genre,</v>

2500
01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:03.780
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sorcery and the snakes and the </v>

2501
01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:04.450
<v Speaker 5>monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's always fighting and you know,</v>

2502
01:51:04.510 --> 01:51:07.070
<v Speaker 5>Conan had the coolest fucking stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what is it?</v>

2503
01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:11.650
<v Speaker 5>I mean literally essentially taps into </v>
<v Speaker 5>them young male fantasy.</v>

2504
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:13.600
<v Speaker 5>Especially the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you become older,</v>

2505
01:51:13.601 --> 01:51:15.160
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in my forties,</v>

2506
01:51:15.161 --> 01:51:17.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm so drop that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2507
01:51:17.021 --> 01:51:20.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm not supposed to be like into like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the next cone and movie.</v>

2508
01:51:20.411 --> 01:51:22.390
<v Speaker 5>Like someone get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's ridiculous.</v>

2509
01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:26.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm a father and as a grown man and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the Conan,</v>

2510
01:51:26.021 --> 01:51:29.050
<v Speaker 5>the barbarian cares,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it becomes,</v>

2511
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:30.280
<v Speaker 5>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

2512
01:51:30.281 --> 01:51:35.281
<v Speaker 5>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it taps into like a real curse </v>

2513
01:51:35.281 --> 01:51:37.240
<v Speaker 5>adolescent childhood sort of fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 5>genre thing in our heads.</v>

2514
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:38.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who doesn't want to.</v>

2515
01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:41.370
<v Speaker 5>What was in the movie?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the best thing?</v>

2516
01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:46.380
<v Speaker 5>Life Corner,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your enemies have been before you hear </v>

2517
01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:49.450
<v Speaker 5>the limitations of women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that,</v>

2518
01:51:49.451 --> 01:51:53.120
<v Speaker 5>what is the limitation lamp?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to say lamination.</v>

2519
01:51:56.030 --> 01:51:56.650
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's funny,</v>

2520
01:51:56.651 --> 01:52:01.651
<v Speaker 5>I actually grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I watched Conan a million times in </v>

2521
01:52:01.651 --> 01:52:02.800
<v Speaker 5>Italian and so I never really heard it </v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

2522
01:52:03.090 --> 01:52:04.270
<v Speaker 5>in English.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when I heard,</v>

2523
01:52:04.271 --> 01:52:05.740
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our note speaking it,</v>

2524
01:52:05.770 --> 01:52:06.730
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh Jesus,</v>

2525
01:52:06.731 --> 01:52:08.880
<v Speaker 5>this is a whole completely different </v>
<v Speaker 5>movie watching kids.</v>

2526
01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:11.200
<v Speaker 5>At least that was the original voice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2527
01:52:11.230 --> 01:52:12.160
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come here.</v>

2528
01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:14.470
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't just these mentally tough guy,</v>

2529
01:52:14.471 --> 01:52:19.471
<v Speaker 5>but nothing particular,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one ever gets it right when they do </v>

2530
01:52:19.511 --> 01:52:22.990
<v Speaker 5>like a voiceover,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they hardly ever get it right that time.</v>

2531
01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:25.210
<v Speaker 5>Maybe because I at least include that </v>
<v Speaker 5>one first.</v>

2532
01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:26.380
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>

2533
01:52:26.381 --> 01:52:27.630
<v Speaker 5>they English.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Arson sucks.</v>

2534
01:52:27.670 --> 01:52:29.020
<v Speaker 5>It's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really.</v>

2535
01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:31.630
<v Speaker 5>So the English version would arnold who </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't as good.</v>

2536
01:52:31.690 --> 01:52:33.340
<v Speaker 5>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it makes you laugh.</v>

2537
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:37.360
<v Speaker 5>His voice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially when you don't expect it,</v>

2538
01:52:37.361 --> 01:52:42.361
<v Speaker 5>because I was used to seeing Conan </v>
<v Speaker 5>speaking like a regular human being and </v>

2539
01:52:42.361 --> 01:52:45.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying he might have went with a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could accent his accent.</v>

2540
01:52:45.710 --> 01:52:47.830
<v Speaker 5>Listen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but my accent is great.</v>

2541
01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:51.770
<v Speaker 5>Will your accent has a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 5>classical flair to it?</v>

2542
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:53.950
<v Speaker 5>The Italian accent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's go to the garden.</v>

2543
01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:57.460
<v Speaker 5>A role to the tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Everybody can be cool.</v>

2575
01:54:24.181 --> 01:54:29.181
<v Speaker 1>Everybody should be generous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like surrounding yourself with a bunch </v>

2576
01:54:29.181 --> 01:54:29.580
<v Speaker 1>of people that you really like and </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

2577
01:54:29.581 --> 01:54:34.581
<v Speaker 1>don't tolerate any bullshit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>negativity from removed that shit from </v>

2578
01:54:34.581 --> 01:54:35.280
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remove that shift from what you're doing</v>

2579
01:54:35.281 --> 01:54:40.281
<v Speaker 1>for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Push yourself in the direction that you </v>

2580
01:54:40.281 --> 01:54:40.281
<v Speaker 1>actually want to go in.</v>

2581
01:54:40.281 --> 01:54:40.281
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you put that out there,</v>

2582
01:54:40.281 --> 01:54:44.930
<v Speaker 1>people respond to it and they start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts to become a part of their </v>

2583
01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:49.011
<v Speaker 1>vibration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to become a part of who they are </v>

2584
01:54:49.011 --> 01:54:49.011
<v Speaker 1>as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2585
01:54:49.011 --> 01:54:52.670
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's what's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have like this crazy group of people </v>

2586
01:54:52.670 --> 01:54:53.240
<v Speaker 1>that are super cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2587
01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:53.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2588
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:58.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not delusional about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds completely ridiculous that I </v>

2589
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.910
<v Speaker 1>would even say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2590
01:54:58.910 --> 01:55:02.910
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why my crowd's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you go to my shows,</v>

2591
01:55:02.911 --> 01:55:06.450
<v Speaker 1>the waitresses are always saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was so nice and that they're so.</v>

2592
01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:08.850
<v Speaker 1>They're so generous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just,</v>

2593
01:55:08.851 --> 01:55:09.810
<v Speaker 1>you put that out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2594
01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good for all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2595
01:55:11.581 --> 01:55:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't figure this out all on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

2596
01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I had to meet a bunch of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>started behaving like this.</v>

2597
01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:17.790
<v Speaker 1>I had to meet people that had their shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

2598
01:55:17.791 --> 01:55:22.791
<v Speaker 1>that impressed me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're nice and were positive and </v>

2599
01:55:22.791 --> 01:55:23.000
<v Speaker 1>that impacted me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I learned from the way they behaved.</v>

2600
01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:23.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2601
01:55:24.090 --> 01:55:29.090
<v Speaker 1>I think we're all doing that for each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and these conversations and you </v>

2602
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:29.090
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2603
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:30.450
<v Speaker 1>these subjects that we're having these </v>
<v Speaker 1>know these subjects are,</v>

2604
01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:32.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unusual that you would have,</v>

2605
01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:37.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who knows as much religion in </v>

2606
01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:38.460
<v Speaker 1>your life to as you do to sit down with </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2607
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:39.020
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2608
01:55:39.021 --> 01:55:40.660
<v Speaker 1>and go over this kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2609
01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:42.960
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of opportunities that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have to,</v>

2610
01:55:43.290 --> 01:55:48.290
<v Speaker 1>to a lot of big group of cool people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best things about this </v>

2611
01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:48.390
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me happy because,</v>

2612
01:55:48.391 --> 01:55:50.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a judgmental little bastard so I see</v>

2613
01:55:50.401 --> 01:55:51.970
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

2614
01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:53.640

2615
01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:55.410
<v Speaker 1>And all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me to say,</v>

2616
01:55:55.470 --> 01:56:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm blown away by the quality of people </v>

2617

2621
01:56:14.031 --> 01:56:14.580
<v Speaker 1>conversation with some people that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch base with me after that.</v>

2622
01:56:14.581 --> 01:56:16.920
<v Speaker 1>I was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really impressed with it,</v>

01:56:23.871 --> 01:56:25.350
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you put out there in the universe.</v>

2628
01:56:25.351 --> 01:56:28.020
<v Speaker 1>It sounds completely corny and hippie </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ridiculous,</v>

2629
01:56:28.530 --> 01:56:31.200
<v Speaker 1>but I think the EU,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all,</v>

2630
01:56:31.201 --> 01:56:36.201
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all can do with like sort of </v>

2631
01:56:36.201 --> 01:56:39.540
<v Speaker 1>absorbing a good community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all could do that at the Internet and</v>

2632
01:56:39.541 --> 01:56:44.541
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the big powers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Internet gives us is it gives </v>

2633
01:56:44.761 --> 01:56:46.340
<v Speaker 1>us the ability to form communities.</v>

2634
01:56:46.350 --> 01:56:50.190
<v Speaker 1>It gives us the ability to choose who </v>
<v Speaker 1>you associate with and,</v>

2635
01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:53.130
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and connect to people in a way that it's</v>

2636
01:56:53.131 --> 01:56:55.830
<v Speaker 1>never really been possible before </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the funny thing.</v>

2637
01:56:55.831 --> 01:57:00.831
<v Speaker 1>You probably get the message from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy in Iceland somewhere where he's like</v>

2638
01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:04.050
<v Speaker 1>the weird guy in the village and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else is looking at him like,</v>

2639
01:57:04.051 --> 01:57:09.051
<v Speaker 1>what's your problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now he has a chance to realize shit </v>

2640
01:57:09.051 --> 01:57:11.781
<v Speaker 1>that are other people out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see the water the way I do and </v>

2641
01:57:11.781 --> 01:57:15.500
<v Speaker 1>the message board and on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's always people from people </v>

2642

<v Speaker 1>from Norway and Sweden and Iceland and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all throughout Europe and all </v>

2643

<v Speaker 1>throughout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've have people that post from China,</v>

2644
01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:23.140
<v Speaker 1>from islands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>anybody from anywhere in the world.</v>

2650
01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:35.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like sinking up through this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's going to be something </v>

2651
01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:38.841
<v Speaker 1>after that it was going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to figure out some next </v>

<v Speaker 1>going to get really strange.</v>

2700
01:59:39.650 --> 01:59:39.650
<v Speaker 5>one thing that killed Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what an unlikely choice.</v>

2701
01:59:39.650 --> 01:59:42.660
<v Speaker 5>Speaking of which can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because up until not that long before,</v>

2702
01:59:42.661 --> 01:59:47.661
<v Speaker 5>one of the choice for more of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>penalty was as a people being bailed out</v>

2703
01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:48.930
<v Speaker 5>budget,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not always the case.</v>

2704
01:59:48.931 --> 01:59:53.830
<v Speaker 5>People would have hanging out there with</v>
<v Speaker 5>bikes to get to a guy sas and that.</v>

2705
01:59:53.970 --> 01:59:54.940
<v Speaker 5>That would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2706
01:59:54.941 --> 01:59:59.941
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the originator or the original story </v>

2707
01:59:59.941 --> 02:00:01.110
<v Speaker 5>that draco was based on Vlad the impaler</v>
<v Speaker 5>Baylor.</v>

2708
02:00:01.130 --> 02:00:03.240
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He used to eat his lunch and they,</v>

2709
02:00:03.241 --> 02:00:04.400
<v Speaker 5>there's photos of him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2710
02:00:04.401 --> 02:00:09.401
<v Speaker 5>not photos of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously the drawings rather have him </v>

2711
02:00:09.401 --> 02:00:13.881
<v Speaker 5>sitting at a banquet table while these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are on spikes writhing around </v>

2712
02:00:14.191 --> 02:00:16.080
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's how you eat his dinner,</v>

2713
02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:17.350
<v Speaker 5>pick it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible],</v>

2714
02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:19.830
<v Speaker 5>see Cedar liquidity badges.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody thinking,</v>

2715
02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:21.690
<v Speaker 5>let me figure out and I can shop.</v>

2716
02:00:21.690 --> 02:00:25.410
<v Speaker 5>And these giant Paula somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but missing all the internal organs.</v>

2717
02:00:25.411 --> 02:00:27.570
<v Speaker 5>So I don't kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they get slowly.</v>

2718
02:00:27.630 --> 02:00:29.040
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

2719
02:00:29.410 --> 02:00:33.180
<v Speaker 5>think of that horrible man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just what a terrible way to die.</v>

2720
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:36.870
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to even wrap your head on.</v>

2721
02:00:36.871 --> 02:00:39.000
<v Speaker 5>And it took a long time for those people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that die.</v>

2722
02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:41.160
<v Speaker 5>It took a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the goal.</v>

2725
02:00:48.130 --> 02:00:50.020

<v Speaker 5>And one of the things,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You'll just me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

2742
02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:33.260
<v Speaker 5>me make mimic the pole up the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be the thing you would do </v>

2743
02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:35.100
<v Speaker 5>instead of the cross.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

2744
02:01:35.101 --> 02:01:36.300
<v Speaker 5>People Enter Church Avenue.</v>

2745
02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:38.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you imagine?</v>

2746
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:40.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh that be so ridiculous.</v>

2747
02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:46.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just as ridiculous as nailing </v>

2748
02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:46.300
<v Speaker 5>yourself to the fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2749
02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:47.410
<v Speaker 5>what do you do when you're making the </v>
<v Speaker 5>points of the cross the cross?</v>

2750
02:01:47.411 --> 02:01:49.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's such a bizarre symbol.</v>

2751
02:01:49.131 --> 02:01:50.660
<v Speaker 5>Lenny Bruce said it best,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

2752
02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:52.160
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>100 years from now.</v>

2753
02:01:52.161 --> 02:01:57.161
<v Speaker 5>It's like people walking around with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>electric chairs around their neck and </v>

2754
02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:59.120
<v Speaker 5>fucked up the junk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forgot how he said it.</v>

2755
02:01:59.510 --> 02:02:01.280
<v Speaker 5>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget exact wording.</v>

2756
02:02:01.281 --> 02:02:06.281
<v Speaker 5>And then Bill Hicks had another one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a really variation on that </v>

2757
02:02:06.281 --> 02:02:06.860
<v Speaker 5>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said it was like a Jackie Onassis and</v>

2758
02:02:06.861 --> 02:02:10.700
<v Speaker 5>walking up to her whether with a rifle </v>
<v Speaker 5>pendant on thinking about John,</v>

2759
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:13.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really kind of on the same job,</v>

2760
02:02:13.390 --> 02:02:17.480
<v Speaker 5>but it really is true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They killed him on that thing and people</v>

2761
02:02:17.481 --> 02:02:19.460
<v Speaker 5>carried around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How'd that tradition gets started?</v>

2762
02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:21.970
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2763
02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:23.900
<v Speaker 5>do much way to our different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>

2764
02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:28.900
<v Speaker 5>You don't remember?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't remember how that tradition </v>

2765
02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:28.900
<v Speaker 5>got started?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How they started mailing?</v>

2766
02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:30.230
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they link people to the cross.</v>

2767
02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:32.750
<v Speaker 5>You got high before the show didn't you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know?</v>

2768
02:02:33.020 --> 02:02:36.610
<v Speaker 5>We got a little too high in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's rocket fuel son.</v>

2769
02:02:36.710 --> 02:02:37.910
<v Speaker 5>That's high grade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

2770
02:02:37.911 --> 02:02:39.020
<v Speaker 5>It's problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a wave.</v>

2771
02:02:39.021 --> 02:02:44.021
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it crushes you onto it and then you got </v>

2772
02:02:44.021 --> 02:02:44.021
<v Speaker 5>to get back up on your board.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Happy.</v>

2773
02:02:44.021 --> 02:02:45.080
<v Speaker 5>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it doesn't really matter some moments</v>

2774
02:02:45.081 --> 02:02:50.081
<v Speaker 5>I'm on and that makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like failing similarity in as long as </v>

2775
02:02:50.121 --> 02:02:51.590
<v Speaker 5>you're happy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm happy.</v>

2776
02:02:52.590 --> 02:02:53.900
<v Speaker 5>But.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So how did they,</v>

2777
02:02:53.901 --> 02:02:54.260
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>W,</v>

2778
02:02:54.261 --> 02:02:59.261
<v Speaker 5>W,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why do people start carrying around the </v>

2779
02:02:59.261 --> 02:02:59.261
<v Speaker 5>cross?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was one off.</v>

2780
02:02:59.261 --> 02:03:02.590
<v Speaker 5>Does a punishments like impaling people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea was how can we make you </v>

2781
02:03:02.590 --> 02:03:07.560
<v Speaker 5>suffered reward in a very public way </v>
<v Speaker 5>where people go by and they will see you</v>

2782
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:11.210
<v Speaker 5>slowly dying there for three days and </v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2783
02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:15.500
<v Speaker 5>it goes back to this desire of rulers in</v>
<v Speaker 5>17 states and the Roman sweater,</v>

2784
02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:20.800
<v Speaker 5>perfect example of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they weren't the only ones doing </v>

2785
02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:20.800
<v Speaker 5>that tool.</v>

2786
02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:23.950
<v Speaker 5>Got into it because he was a way to make</v>
<v Speaker 5>a statement which is don't fuck with us </v>

2787
02:03:23.950 --> 02:03:27.110
<v Speaker 5>because if you ever even think of </v>
<v Speaker 5>rebelling against us,</v>

2788
02:03:27.130 --> 02:03:32.130
<v Speaker 5>this is what's going to happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And every time you go down the street </v>

2789
02:03:32.130 --> 02:03:32.360
<v Speaker 5>you see somebody there and think about </v>
<v Speaker 5>you being there.</v>

2790
02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:35.230
<v Speaker 5>You might want to think about that plan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Offer a value on that.</v>

2791
02:03:35.231 --> 02:03:37.280
<v Speaker 5>You how often when they crucifying </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

2792
02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:40.820
<v Speaker 5>and I mean you don't have to do it that </v>
<v Speaker 5>often to have an impact on people.</v>

2793
02:03:40.821 --> 02:03:45.821
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you need to see that many </v>
<v Speaker 5>people crucified for it to stay in your </v>

2794
02:03:45.821 --> 02:03:45.821
<v Speaker 5>head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2795
02:03:45.821 --> 02:03:47.760
<v Speaker 5>but you had cases like when the spiral </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychosis,</v>

2796
02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:51.980
<v Speaker 5>where after the rebellion they grabbed </v>
<v Speaker 5>like thousands of slaves and nailed them</v>

2797
02:03:51.981 --> 02:03:56.330
<v Speaker 5>one every so many hundred feet between </v>
<v Speaker 5>Naples and Rome.</v>

2798
02:03:56.450 --> 02:04:01.450
<v Speaker 5>That's a long fucking high and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>entire way people on Colossus or oh my </v>

2799
02:04:01.610 --> 02:04:04.580
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

2800
02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:05.540
<v Speaker 5>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hardcore.</v>

2801
02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:13.520
<v Speaker 5>That is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now how the fuck do people go from </v>

2802
02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:14.340
<v Speaker 5>that to wearing one around your chain </v>
<v Speaker 5>diamonds?</v>

2803
02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:18.620
<v Speaker 5>How did she go from one P diddy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2804
02:04:18.650 --> 02:04:20.650
<v Speaker 5>big ass bling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bling crosses.</v>

2805
02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:25.680
<v Speaker 5>So Jesus is up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I love about 80 scrape </v>

2806
02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:26.100
<v Speaker 5>shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2807
02:04:26.690 --> 02:04:31.690
<v Speaker 5>like Jesus don't like him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the guy was very hardcore about </v>

2808
02:04:31.690 --> 02:04:31.690
<v Speaker 5>economics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2809
02:04:31.690 --> 02:04:36.221
<v Speaker 5>one of the things he says is a easier </v>
<v Speaker 5>for a camel to go through the eye of a </v>

2810
02:04:36.221 --> 02:04:37.500
<v Speaker 5>needle than for a rich man to get into </v>
<v Speaker 5>heaven.</v>

2811
02:04:37.690 --> 02:04:38.310
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2812
02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Karl Marx doesn't go that far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean,</v>

2813
02:04:41.810 --> 02:04:46.810
<v Speaker 1>it's like easier for a camel to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the eye of a needle than for a </v>

2814
02:04:46.810 --> 02:04:51.471
<v Speaker 1>rich man to get into heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn Jesus was dropping some poor </v>

2815
02:04:51.471 --> 02:04:51.800
<v Speaker 1>man's science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2816
02:04:51.810 --> 02:04:56.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean he is probably a bit in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably totally a bit in the </v>

2817
02:04:56.810 --> 02:04:57.180
<v Speaker 1>crosses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So explain to me again,</v>

2818
02:04:57.730 --> 02:04:59.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to write this down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did the crosses,</v>

2819
02:04:59.821 --> 02:05:04.821
<v Speaker 1>how far did they last from old people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piss Shit.</v>

2820
02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:10.220
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time is definitely money was emerged as </v>

2821
02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:11.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say started in Burger but,</v>

2822
02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:16.530
<v Speaker 1>but the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that were a pinned off in the</v>

2823
02:05:16.531 --> 02:05:17.740
<v Speaker 1>cross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2824
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:18.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2825
02:05:19.070 --> 02:05:21.240
<v Speaker 1>the road that you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was 1000.</v>

2826
02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:23.520
<v Speaker 1>How many feet was it where people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the cross?</v>

2827
02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:28.560
<v Speaker 1>He was between Naples and Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how far as the economic center later</v>

2828
02:05:29.370 --> 02:05:29.870
<v Speaker 1>in April.</v>

2829
02:05:30.410 --> 02:05:35.410
<v Speaker 1>So he's a good chunk of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely over a hundred miles I </v>

2830
02:05:35.410 --> 02:05:35.410
<v Speaker 1>can remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for 100 miles.</v>

2831
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

2833
02:05:38.071 --> 02:05:43.071
<v Speaker 1>I forgot how many hundred miles people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were strung up on crosses.</v>

2834
02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they add some thousands of,</v>

2835
02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:48.990
<v Speaker 1>but he's a nurse for Lilian defeating </v>
<v Speaker 1>spartacus.</v>

2836
02:05:49.050 --> 02:05:52.380
<v Speaker 1>They had leaked already thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and so they decided to execute them</v>

2837
02:05:52.381 --> 02:05:57.381
<v Speaker 1>all by sticking demo long colossus </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Rome and Naples where now,</v>

2838
02:05:58.071 --> 02:06:03.071
<v Speaker 1>where the whole thing went down and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a very public statement about four </v>

2839
02:06:03.071 --> 02:06:05.540
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leave thinking about labels in the room.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's more than that.</v>

2842
02:06:09.810 --> 02:06:14.810
<v Speaker 1>It's because he's not a wire to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2843
02:06:15.710 --> 02:06:17.730
<v Speaker 1>at the Emmy's wherein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2844
02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>big ass fucking platinum cross with some</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice Diane was on and maybe white gold </v>

2845
02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:26.040
<v Speaker 1>and that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2846
02:06:26.041 --> 02:06:29.250
<v Speaker 1>You get the reach thing to do it without</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2847
02:06:29.251 --> 02:06:30.330
<v Speaker 1>that rich people will know.</v>

2848
02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:35.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is or the big cross </v>

2849
02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:35.940
<v Speaker 1>tattoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another one,</v>

2850
02:06:36.750 --> 02:06:37.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>

2851
02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:38.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

2852
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:42.850
<v Speaker 1>I get what you're trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you've really thought about what,</v>

2853
02:06:42.890 --> 02:06:47.890
<v Speaker 1>what the cross was used for Jesus Christ</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I don't think anybody knows that.</v>

2854
02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:53.300
<v Speaker 1>I think very few people knew that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a time in history where people were </v>

2855
02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:53.300
<v Speaker 1>strung up on crosses for over a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles.</v>

2856
02:06:53.810 --> 02:06:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many actual total humans was that I </v>

2857
02:06:58.810 --> 02:06:58.860
<v Speaker 1>think has about $5,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>

2858
02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:00.930
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't in the thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

2859
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I want to say five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2860

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2861
02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:08.790
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the thing in enrollment </v>
<v Speaker 1>times they add gazillions,</v>

2862
02:07:08.791 --> 02:07:12.030
<v Speaker 1>laves and yet hardly ever any rebellion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2863
02:07:12.031 --> 02:07:14.220
<v Speaker 1>you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when they do it,</v>

2864
02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:19.240
<v Speaker 1>they got strung up on cross this for </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of miles and have their power </v>

2865
02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:19.240
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>

2866
02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:23.010
<v Speaker 1>They were replaced with power lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same visual of these creepy pap,</v>

2867

<v Speaker 1>crosses brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2991
02:12:23.810 --> 02:12:27.200
<v Speaker 1>An article on Forbes magazine argues at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Msg,</v>

2992
02:12:27.230 --> 02:12:29.640
<v Speaker 1>monosodium glutamate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2993
02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:33.260
<v Speaker 1>may actually be good for the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2994
02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

2995
02:12:34.910 --> 02:12:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Since the onion daily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you asked the US health nuts avoided </v>

2996
02:12:39.910 --> 02:12:41.480
<v Speaker 1>like the plague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but many parts of Asia.</v>

2997
02:12:41.481 --> 02:12:44.900
<v Speaker 1>It sits on the table along with salt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pepper to enhance the flavor of meals,</v>

2998
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:50.350
<v Speaker 1>leading expert in Msg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>senior scientist company named Blah </v>

2999
02:12:50.350 --> 02:12:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

3000
02:12:50.350 --> 02:12:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Insist that the definitive link between </v>
<v Speaker 1>MSG and headaches has yet to be proven.</v>

3001
02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own research has shown that the </v>

3002
02:12:58.680 --> 02:12:58.680
<v Speaker 1>hospital's patients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital,</v>

3003
02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:01.220
<v Speaker 1>patients who have lost their appetite </v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely eat their meals.</v>

3004
02:13:01.221 --> 02:13:06.221
<v Speaker 1>When sprinkled with MSG.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This he postulates could help elderly </v>

3005
02:13:06.221 --> 02:13:09.971
<v Speaker 1>and sick people improve their appetites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get nutrition they need and live longer </v>

3006
02:13:09.971 --> 02:13:11.680
<v Speaker 1>or smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smoking weed would do better than Msj.</v>

3007
02:13:11.950 --> 02:13:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Maybe smoking weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MSG together is the mother fucker put </v>

3008
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:18.590
<v Speaker 1>some mock poop on that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3009
02:13:18.591 --> 02:13:23.591
<v Speaker 1>I remember it being a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember people were always saying </v>

3010
02:13:23.591 --> 02:13:23.990
<v Speaker 1>avoid msg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it became a big deal.</v>

3011
02:13:23.991 --> 02:13:25.360
<v Speaker 1>I kind of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3012
02:13:26.060 --> 02:13:26.730
<v Speaker 1>It was something that people.</v>

3013
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:30.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like right on kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like even one day they're like,</v>

3014
02:13:30.381 --> 02:13:31.290
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3015
02:13:31.291 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 2>there was this news</v>

3016
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:37.040
<v Speaker 1>report saying that Msg is bad for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'd Kinda blew up like radon </v>

3017
02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:40.671
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did people get like wacky rules as </v>

3018
02:13:40.671 --> 02:13:40.671
<v Speaker 1>to like what you can and can't eat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like biblical days,</v>

3019
02:13:40.671 --> 02:13:43.290
<v Speaker 1>like the cloven hoof thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pork.</v>

3020
02:13:43.291 --> 02:13:46.380
<v Speaker 1>What does that even make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably,</v>

3021
02:13:46.381 --> 02:13:47.650
<v Speaker 1>there are certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3022
02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:51.120
<v Speaker 1>animals that are freaking dirty that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely to carry diseases.</v>

3023
02:13:51.190 --> 02:13:56.190
<v Speaker 1>People do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lead them and just freaking </v>

3024
02:13:56.190 --> 02:13:56.190
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steel gets battered around.</v>

3025
02:13:56.190 --> 02:13:58.350
<v Speaker 1>So let just say that God said you </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't eat that were done with it,</v>

3026
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:59.980
<v Speaker 1>like chicken little sis and shit like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3027
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:02.820
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it boiled down to reality,</v>

3028
02:14:02.850 --> 02:14:04.890
<v Speaker 1>factual things that people said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

3029
02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:07.990
<v Speaker 1>we need to make a hardcoded rule because</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise people don't respect it.</v>

3030
02:14:07.991 --> 02:14:10.650
<v Speaker 1>So let's make it that God said so and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3031
02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:12.660
<v Speaker 1>let's have everybody stick to it.</v>

3032
02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:18.200
<v Speaker 1>And then of course then they stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>making sense when hundreds of years </v>

3033
02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:18.200
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of theater slate their article</v>

3034
02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Nisha and Saturday for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they no longer are,</v>

3035
02:14:19.861 --> 02:14:24.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals could be cleaner </v>

3036
02:14:24.861 --> 02:14:24.861
<v Speaker 1>conditionals or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the rules sticks around.</v>

3037
02:14:24.861 --> 02:14:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are really nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3038
02:14:26.310 --> 02:14:28.800
<v Speaker 1>like at a certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

3039
02:14:28.850 --> 02:14:33.850
<v Speaker 1>it isn't based on health anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just based on this strange </v>

3040
02:14:33.850 --> 02:14:33.850
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3041
02:14:33.850 --> 02:14:37.760
<v Speaker 1>there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that you're guilty if you eat like </v>

3042
02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:37.950
<v Speaker 1>the pig and the swine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the big thing about Muslims.</v>

3043
02:14:37.951 --> 02:14:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat swine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3044
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:40.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you that like,</v>

3045
02:14:40.690 --> 02:14:43.050
<v Speaker 1>I remember that was like a cool thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>for rappers to say.</v>

3046
02:14:43.051 --> 02:14:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Like back in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't eat swine.</v>

3047
02:14:45.590 --> 02:14:47.030
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't eat swine.</v>

3048
02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious.</v>

3049
02:14:48.211 --> 02:14:50.130
<v Speaker 1>You asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

3050
02:14:50.131 --> 02:14:52.620
<v Speaker 1>You don't eat bacon or your heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't eat bacon.</v>

3051
02:14:54.140 --> 02:14:56.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the idea that your religion to</v>

3052
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:58.620
<v Speaker 1>keep you from Bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that's all you need to know.</v>

3053
02:14:58.621 --> 02:15:00.450
<v Speaker 1>They're not looking out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They keep you.</v>

3054
02:15:00.451 --> 02:15:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Keep you from barbecue pork as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get the fuck outta here.</v>

3055
02:15:03.390 --> 02:15:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Your religion keeps you from spare ribs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're assholes.</v>

3056
02:15:06.450 --> 02:15:11.450
<v Speaker 1>They must be assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to Dr Holly [inaudible] in </v>

3057
02:15:11.450 --> 02:15:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Venice and have the spare ribs and tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that that's not heavenly,</v>

3058
02:15:13.290 --> 02:15:18.290
<v Speaker 1>that's not a gift of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason God made those ribs </v>

3059
02:15:18.290 --> 02:15:18.290
<v Speaker 1>tastes so God damn good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3060
02:15:18.290 --> 02:15:20.550
<v Speaker 1>I am done with your religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you approach it?</v>

3061
02:15:20.551 --> 02:15:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Is like if a religion doesn't electric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you about Baker?</v>

3062
02:15:23.970 --> 02:15:24.930
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After you.</v>

3063
02:15:24.931 --> 02:15:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Religion doesn't let you eat vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not looking out for you there.</v>

3064
02:15:28.070 --> 02:15:33.070
<v Speaker 1>They're assholes and I like nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we need to make a new </v>

3065
02:15:33.070 --> 02:15:33.070
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

3066
02:15:33.070 --> 02:15:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Are you willing to put this together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do your new book that you're </v>

3067
02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:38.160
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to construct a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

3068
02:15:38.190 --> 02:15:40.470
<v Speaker 1>The working title is create your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

3069
02:15:40.471 --> 02:15:42.720
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to pick out all the best</v>

3070
02:15:42.721 --> 02:15:47.721
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea that have to have any </v>

3071
02:15:47.721 --> 02:15:49.740
<v Speaker 1>basis in any previous stories or how can</v>
<v Speaker 1>it be substantiated?</v>

3072
02:15:49.860 --> 02:15:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Is there any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know like you could use scientology </v>

3073
02:15:54.860 --> 02:15:58.121
<v Speaker 1>is what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not based on faith so it's based </v>

3074
02:15:58.121 --> 02:15:58.121
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3075
02:15:58.121 --> 02:15:59.440
<v Speaker 1>what makes sense to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what seems to work and then you know,</v>

3076
02:15:59.530 --> 02:16:00.840
<v Speaker 1>try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't work,</v>

3077
02:16:00.841 --> 02:16:02.670
<v Speaker 1>change it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're including religions,</v>

3078
02:16:02.671 --> 02:16:06.770
<v Speaker 1>are you allowed to include ones that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know somebody made up mean scientology?</v>

3079
02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:10.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I feel like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3080
02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Why is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3081
02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:15.510
<v Speaker 1>why is it any different than what had </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened with that one guy with a dragon</v>

3082
02:16:15.511 --> 02:16:18.810
<v Speaker 1>suit that million people died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but said it was Jesus's brother.</v>

3083
02:16:18.810 --> 02:16:20.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat scientology was sensing that.</v>

3084
02:16:21.330 --> 02:16:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a number of people took </v>

3085
02:16:26.330 --> 02:16:26.330
<v Speaker 1>extremely seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I would say,</v>

3086
02:16:26.330 --> 02:16:26.330
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's play with it.</v>

3087
02:16:26.330 --> 02:16:31.280
<v Speaker 1>I would agree with you if I hadn't met </v>
<v Speaker 1>so many actors and I think that that's </v>

3088
02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:34.060
<v Speaker 1>why I haven't done so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like,</v>

3089
02:16:34.250 --> 02:16:35.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of acting,</v>

3090
02:16:35.580 --> 02:16:39.610
<v Speaker 1>it's a hugely popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hugely popular amongst successful people</v>

3091
02:16:39.611 --> 02:16:44.611
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it gives them some sort of a </v>

3092
02:16:44.611 --> 02:16:46.570
<v Speaker 1>framework in which to think and behave </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a framework of positivity.</v>

3093
02:16:46.571 --> 02:16:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3094
02:16:47.261 --> 02:16:48.400
<v Speaker 1>everyone's seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3095
02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:53.530
<v Speaker 1>the Tom Cruise in indoctrination video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about a car accident.</v>

3096
02:16:53.531 --> 02:16:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I keep it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't seen it,</v>

3097
02:16:55.751 --> 02:16:56.860
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to look it up.</v>

3098
02:16:57.670 --> 02:16:59.710
<v Speaker 1>If they haven't pulled it from the web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope God,</v>

3099
02:16:59.711 --> 02:17:02.590
<v Speaker 1>I hope they haven't pulled it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they pulled that cubicle?</v>

3100
02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:04.330
<v Speaker 1>The yogi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one.</v>

3101
02:17:04.380 --> 02:17:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're a scientologist these so </v>

3102
02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:09.940
<v Speaker 1>fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>charismatic and it's like,</v>

3103
02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.290
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so good at it.</v>

3104
02:17:11.590 --> 02:17:13.420
<v Speaker 1>He will be an awesome cult leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3105
02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:16.330
<v Speaker 1>he might have to do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might have to step in.</v>

3106
02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:21.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to also stepping up because </v>

3107
02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:21.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not high enough in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

3108
02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:21.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3109
02:17:21.941 --> 02:17:26.941
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have to pump him up a little </v>

3110
02:17:26.941 --> 02:17:28.060
<v Speaker 1>too mucky thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So man,</v>

3111
02:17:28.061 --> 02:17:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I think he's so charismatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get away with it.</v>

3112
02:17:30.101 --> 02:17:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Just make sure you keep them on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>podium.</v>

3113
02:17:31.570 --> 02:17:33.520
<v Speaker 1>No one's even gonna know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>

3114
02:17:33.521 --> 02:17:38.521
<v Speaker 1>everybody is always seen you on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can always make him look the alert </v>

3115
02:17:38.521 --> 02:17:39.600
<v Speaker 1>if you see this dude is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

3116
02:17:39.700 --> 02:17:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's not that short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I thought from what I heard at is </v>

3117
02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:47.491
<v Speaker 1>like these probably mostly like hobbits </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not nearly as short as everybody </v>

3118
02:17:47.491 --> 02:17:47.491
<v Speaker 1>says.</v>

3119
02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:51.430
<v Speaker 1>They probably want to make him seem like</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of a loser because he upsets them.</v>

3120
02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Probably felt good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing probably probably.</v>

3121
02:17:53.620 --> 02:17:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on when there's a guy like Tom </v>

3122
02:17:58.620 --> 02:17:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Cruise has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many goddamn blockbuster movies over</v>

3123
02:17:58.620 --> 02:18:03.361
<v Speaker 1>and over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive success over and over and over </v>

3124
02:18:03.361 --> 02:18:03.361
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to look for flaws.</v>

3125
02:18:03.361 --> 02:18:04.460
<v Speaker 1>He's gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Short.</v>

3126
02:18:04.461 --> 02:18:06.190
<v Speaker 1>He's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you ever hear,</v>

3127
02:18:06.300 --> 02:18:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Jay short the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's a name of the lab.</v>

3128
02:18:09.131 --> 02:18:14.131
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want your life so you must suck for </v>

3129
02:18:14.131 --> 02:18:17.281
<v Speaker 1>some other reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of an effect </v>

3130
02:18:17.281 --> 02:18:18.320
<v Speaker 1>scientology has on his success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of a.</v>

3131
02:18:18.380 --> 02:18:21.190
<v Speaker 1>You know how much of what he pulled off </v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have pulled,</v>

3132
02:18:21.220 --> 02:18:24.580
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have pulled off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't deep in the throes of some.</v>

3133
02:18:24.910 --> 02:18:26.560
<v Speaker 1>I think you're on your way to convert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

3134
02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:28.580
<v Speaker 1>it sounded cooler and cooler by the sec </v>
<v Speaker 1>on though.</v>

3135
02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Maybe man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's the way to do it.</v>

3136
02:18:30.460 --> 02:18:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we need to all join like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable cult,</v>

3137
02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:35.650
<v Speaker 1>a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really has his shit together.</v>

3138
02:18:35.651 --> 02:18:38.200
<v Speaker 1>I bring up this over and over again to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people think I'm fucking serious.</v>

3139
02:18:38.201 --> 02:18:39.970
<v Speaker 1>I want to be clear right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3140
02:18:39.971 --> 02:18:42.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not starting a cult for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking around.</v>

3141
02:18:42.401 --> 02:18:44.590
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just bouncing ideas.</v>

3142
02:18:44.890 --> 02:18:49.890
<v Speaker 1>They'll not really going to set up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>compound where people can show up </v>

3143
02:18:49.890 --> 02:18:49.890
<v Speaker 1>because if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3144
02:18:49.890 --> 02:18:52.150
<v Speaker 1>this is the time of the of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>where if you did do that,</v>

3145
02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:52.840
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

3146
02:18:53.050 --> 02:18:54.530
<v Speaker 1>we have 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>acres.</v>

3147
02:18:54.531 --> 02:18:56.890
<v Speaker 1>It's in Wyoming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can sign up.</v>

3148
02:18:56.891 --> 02:18:59.740
<v Speaker 1>We do a background check on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in build a house.</v>

3149
02:18:59.830 --> 02:19:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Come on in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we started town.</v>

3150
02:19:02.830 --> 02:19:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Did you imagined?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3151
02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would shut that down though,</v>

3152
02:19:06.041 --> 02:19:08.560
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My guess is if we did that,</v>

3153
02:19:08.561 --> 02:19:11.950
<v Speaker 1>would you be willing to go and be our </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious advisor?</v>

3154
02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I've always want to be the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep everybody on the same page.</v>

3155
02:19:16.590 --> 02:19:19.360
<v Speaker 1>You know I got to crucify them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they don't know you can't do that,</v>

3156
02:19:19.361 --> 02:19:20.860
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to try to avoid that.</v>

3157
02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:26.400
<v Speaker 1>What we're trying to do is just get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people together that we don't </v>

3158
02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:26.860
<v Speaker 1>really know that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sue them out of their,</v>

3159
02:19:26.861 --> 02:19:28.100
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their current dogma.</v>

3160
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:29.120
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that.</v>

3161
02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:30.470
<v Speaker 5>That's all we use.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3162
02:19:30.471 --> 02:19:31.160
<v Speaker 5>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3163
02:19:31.161 --> 02:19:34.070
<v Speaker 5>you'd be the guy that under like they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can't argue with you.</v>

3164
02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:40.280
<v Speaker 5>You're having some areas come up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's have a final match cage between </v>

3165
02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:44.830
<v Speaker 5>myself and some areas and see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll get still get the top spot and </v>

3166
02:19:44.830 --> 02:19:45.500
<v Speaker 5>some areas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know the guy interest.</v>

3167
02:19:45.530 --> 02:19:46.670
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sam Harris.</v>

3168
02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:48.990
<v Speaker 5>Oh Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pakistanis.</v>

3169
02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:53.090
<v Speaker 5>But some areas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I agreed to Harris.</v>

3170
02:19:53.180 --> 02:19:58.180
<v Speaker 5>She's going to start his own cult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'll break off in its own direction is </v>

3171
02:19:58.180 --> 02:19:59.060
<v Speaker 5>called to be smarter than our Colt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just thread that.</v>

3172
02:19:59.061 --> 02:20:01.530
<v Speaker 5>He started training Jiu Jitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3173
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:05.180
<v Speaker 5>he's there for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not that long.</v>

3174
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:06.710
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In that case,</v>

3175
02:20:06.770 --> 02:20:08.830
<v Speaker 5>taking private lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got to come on.</v>

3176
02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:10.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's March 8th is.</v>

3177
02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:12.760
<v Speaker 5>He's going to be on and we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>talk about.</v>

3178
02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:16.280
<v Speaker 5>Take him on whether steel learning </v>
<v Speaker 5>before he gets too good.</v>

3179
02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:19.130
<v Speaker 5>At what level is your game?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where you a purple belt level?</v>

3180
02:20:19.131 --> 02:20:22.940
<v Speaker 5>What levels you're gay is weird too </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I enrolled for the longest time,</v>

3181
02:20:22.941 --> 02:20:25.950
<v Speaker 5>not in formal classes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so my way is we are,</v>

3182
02:20:25.951 --> 02:20:29.300
<v Speaker 5>because I'm lacking some pieces of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>game that you should learn when you're a</v>

3183
02:20:29.301 --> 02:20:33.620
<v Speaker 5>fucking white belt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then I don't put my weight.</v>

3184
02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:38.680
<v Speaker 5>I don't put enough pressure on top.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't do some of the stuff that are </v>

3185
02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:41.621
<v Speaker 5>supposed to do that you learn as basics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then at the same time I ever like </v>

3186
02:20:41.621 --> 02:20:45.110
<v Speaker 5>weird us movements that I can tap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People were insanely better to me really</v>

3187
02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:46.940
<v Speaker 5>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of weird.</v>

3188
02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:52.000
<v Speaker 5>Is A,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can lose two really 50 people and I </v>

3189
02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:53.570
<v Speaker 5>can be three to go to people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's hard to gauge in the same way.</v>

3190
02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:58.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Roughly give or take somewhere around </v>

3191
02:20:58.600 --> 02:20:58.600
<v Speaker 5>there somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere around the purple's range.</v>

3192
02:20:58.600 --> 02:21:00.800
<v Speaker 5>But these a is not regular,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3193
02:21:00.801 --> 02:21:03.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm better than a purple belt in some </v>
<v Speaker 5>way and I'm way worse in others.</v>

3194
02:21:03.890 --> 02:21:06.290
<v Speaker 5>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my game is a little weird that way.</v>

3195

<v Speaker 5>I mean as far as good app thing goes.</v>

3199
02:21:14.590 --> 02:21:15.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3200
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:17.600
<v Speaker 5>I did play.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was medically,</v>

02:21:17.620 --> 02:21:19.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>grappling with no geese.</v>

3202
02:21:19.021 --> 02:21:20.810

<v Speaker 5>who did you learn from?</v>

3203
02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:25.840
<v Speaker 5>I started out with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tim Kartra mail was one of the black </v>

3204
02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:26.000
<v Speaker 5>belts from um,</v>

3205
02:21:26.001 --> 02:21:29.190
<v Speaker 5>The guy was starting to crop up Sifaka </v>
<v Speaker 5>Kleiber.</v>

3206
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:32.240
<v Speaker 5>Luciana,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm Carmela was awesome.</v>

3207
02:21:32.270 --> 02:21:34.610
<v Speaker 5>I really like his game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was amazing.</v>

02:21:34.611 --> 02:21:39.611
<v Speaker 5>Grabbed Blur and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he showed me some stuff and then a lot </v>

3209
02:21:39.611 --> 02:21:39.710
<v Speaker 5>of the time I would just add all the way</v>
<v Speaker 5>to people.</v>

3210
02:21:39.710 --> 02:21:44.710
<v Speaker 5>Somebody a daryl garage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had their Jujitsu guys come over </v>

3211
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:48.191
<v Speaker 5>and we will just throw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So a lot of it was not the real and </v>

3212
02:21:48.191 --> 02:21:51.340
<v Speaker 5>formal learning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of it was learned by doing and </v>

3213
02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:51.770
<v Speaker 5>which has its advantages and </v>
<v Speaker 5>disadvantages,</v>

3214
02:21:51.771 --> 02:21:56.771
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm missing a lot of stuff that I </v>

3215
02:21:56.771 --> 02:21:56.771
<v Speaker 5>should know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then I have others seeing that,</v>

<v Speaker 5>we'd know what they are doing.</v>

3220
02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:10.160
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to crank them like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3221

<v Speaker 5>you'll catch somebody in some cases when</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy's not.</v>

3222
02:22:13.041 --> 02:22:14.360

<v Speaker 1>consistent at doing that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high level mma,</v>

3241
02:22:49.740 --> 02:22:52.000
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and neck for the best leg locks.</v>

3243
02:22:57.060 --> 02:22:59.280
<v Speaker 1>He's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so good at rapping.</v>

3244
02:22:59.281 --> 02:23:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Guys up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's got it.</v>

3246
02:23:02.281 --> 02:23:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Also an amazing Omoplata submission </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the inventory where you go,</v>

3247
02:23:06.751 --> 02:23:11.751
<v Speaker 1>like you have the shoulder lock and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you grab an esg grip underneath the </v>

3248
02:23:11.751 --> 02:23:14.850
<v Speaker 1>guy's face and you lean back and it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>snaps his neck.</v>

3249
02:23:14.910 --> 02:23:17.580
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible thing because its arm is</v>

3250
02:23:17.581 --> 02:23:19.530
<v Speaker 1>twisted and you're pulling his neck </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

3251
02:23:19.531 --> 02:23:24.531
<v Speaker 1>It's nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's submitted a couple of guys with </v>

3252
02:23:24.531 --> 02:23:24.531

02:23:24.531 --> 02:23:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Humanity is one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like his style but it does seem a bit </v>

3254
02:23:28.750 --> 02:23:30.480
<v Speaker 1>of a Dick because he willing submission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he really is just,</v>

3257
02:23:36.691 --> 02:23:39.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so good and so feared is because he</v>

3258
02:23:39.631 --> 02:23:40.220
<v Speaker 1>does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's an advantage.</v>

3262
02:23:45.460 --> 02:23:48.570
<v Speaker 1>They're going to try to take his </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience of what his idea is.</v>

02:25:48.570 --> 02:25:48.570
<v Speaker 1>fight started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked over at me and winked.</v>

3309
02:25:48.570 --> 02:25:53.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is so relaxed so you can just </v>

3310
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:53.110
<v Speaker 1>look at you and wink right before he </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to war.</v>

3311
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:55.900
<v Speaker 1>And he was just so calm about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why I was able</v>

3312
02:25:55.901 --> 02:25:58.150
<v Speaker 1>to keep fighting until later ages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

3313
02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:01.330
<v Speaker 1>he was so common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're preserved as energy,</v>

3314
02:26:01.331 --> 02:26:02.740
<v Speaker 1>so efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced,</v>

3315
02:26:03.130 --> 02:26:05.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that Greco Roman man,</v>

3316
02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:08.500
<v Speaker 1>he that the ability to control guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently everybody says it.</v>

3317
02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Randy couture was one of the nastiest </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

3318
02:26:10.541 --> 02:26:12.370
<v Speaker 1>like when he would grab a hold of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of your neck,</v>

3319
02:26:12.620 --> 02:26:14.960
<v Speaker 1>like that control was so nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would like.</v>

3320
02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:18.610
<v Speaker 1>There's dudes that have like different </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of control and you really haven't</v>

3321
02:26:18.611 --> 02:26:21.070
<v Speaker 1>felt it yet and so you sort of have </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3322
02:26:21.071 --> 02:26:26.071
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times you view a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you train with people that only have </v>

3323
02:26:26.071 --> 02:26:29.071
<v Speaker 1>a certain level of skill and then all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sudden you train with someone who has </v>

3324
02:26:29.071 --> 02:26:29.920
<v Speaker 1>a very high level of skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's baffling to you.</v>

3325
02:26:30.150 --> 02:26:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Do you literally aren't even aware that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone could be so good?</v>

3326
02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:39.200
<v Speaker 1>It's staggering to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a apparently a lot of </v>

3327
02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:40.840
<v Speaker 1>people's assessments of Randy's clinch </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he would get ahold of you.</v>

3328
02:26:40.841 --> 02:26:43.210
<v Speaker 1>That's why he was so good at like dirty </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing guys.</v>

3329
02:26:43.540 --> 02:26:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Like when he fought Vito Belfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

3330
02:26:45.821 --> 02:26:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3331
02:26:46.090 --> 02:26:48.100
<v Speaker 1>The first Vito Belfort fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>

3332
02:26:48.101 --> 02:26:49.630
<v Speaker 1>they fought three times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the first one,</v>

3333
02:26:49.631 --> 02:26:53.290
<v Speaker 1>especially when he beat Vito and Vito </v>
<v Speaker 1>was not just undefeated,</v>

3334
02:26:53.291 --> 02:26:58.291
<v Speaker 1>he was just fucking phenol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was tearing guys apart in the first </v>

3335
02:26:58.291 --> 02:26:59.460
<v Speaker 1>round and and randy stopped him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>randy,</v>

3336
02:26:59.570 --> 02:27:01.720
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it was like that dirty boxing </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3337
02:27:01.721 --> 02:27:06.721
<v Speaker 1>He was so good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just controlling the back of your head </v>

3338
02:27:06.721 --> 02:27:06.730
<v Speaker 1>and and pummeling you with shots and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3339
02:27:06.860 --> 02:27:10.390
<v Speaker 1>and forcing you in the cage and taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right angles and know that was a,</v>

3340
02:27:10.391 --> 02:27:13.570
<v Speaker 1>that was the birth of random third to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire fighting.</v>

3341
02:27:13.571 --> 02:27:18.571
<v Speaker 1>UFC was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do you go from zero to </v>

3342
02:27:18.571 --> 02:27:19.090
<v Speaker 1>fighting Vito Belfort and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

3343
02:27:19.270 --> 02:27:22.930
<v Speaker 1>He's an animal and a great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice guy to be around,</v>

3344
02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:25.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really nice to just around theater.</v>

3345
02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:28.000
<v Speaker 1>And I was really very impressed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

3346
02:27:28.001 --> 02:27:28.540
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3347
02:27:28.541 --> 02:27:30.010
<v Speaker 1>these guys are as good as they say.</v>

3348
02:27:30.010 --> 02:27:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is really a cool guy.</v>

3349
02:27:32.410 --> 02:27:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited that because they asked me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to write a book on his career.</v>

3350
02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I who asks you to do this.</v>

3351
02:27:39.310 --> 02:27:40.560
<v Speaker 1>One of the guys that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

3352
02:27:40.561 --> 02:27:41.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy gardener,</v>

3353
02:27:41.770 --> 02:27:46.770
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the guys that I know for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trainers take studying her and so he </v>

3354
02:27:46.770 --> 02:27:48.340
<v Speaker 1>said let's work on it together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3355
02:27:48.341 --> 02:27:53.341
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to do it and then my writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you say helping and we'll write it </v>

3356
02:27:53.341 --> 02:27:54.880
<v Speaker 1>and do this thing about Ryan because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying,</v>

3357
02:27:54.881 --> 02:27:57.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the MMA books that are out there</v>

3358
02:27:57.701 --> 02:27:59.530
<v Speaker 1>out to biographies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are cool.</v>

3359
02:27:59.950 --> 02:28:02.260
<v Speaker 1>But then in an autobiography you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>only go,</v>

3360
02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:07.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only hype it up so much because </v>

3361
02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:07.500
<v Speaker 1>you sound like an asshole.</v>

3362
02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Whereas doing it as a third person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we wheat a lot of the voices from </v>

3363
02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Houston bone ends kind of like a early </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of thing where you get multiple </v>

3364
02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:22.570
<v Speaker 1>feel the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different way of documentary to </v>

3365
02:28:22.570 --> 02:28:23.410
<v Speaker 1>man and that's the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

3366
02:28:23.411 --> 02:28:25.190
<v Speaker 1>to the weight as um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a book.</v>

3367
02:28:25.191 --> 02:28:30.191
<v Speaker 1>And then to shoot the interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there for his very first fight </v>

3368
02:28:30.191 --> 02:28:32.930
<v Speaker 1>against Tony Hallmark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 1997 or 98.</v>

3369
02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:34.760
<v Speaker 1>It might've been [inaudible] 97.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 97.</v>

3370
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3371
02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Tony Hama was just giant fucking pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestler and randy couture,</v>

3372
02:28:40.730 --> 02:28:43.460
<v Speaker 1>doc under that dude's big punch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got him,</v>

3373
02:28:43.490 --> 02:28:46.550
<v Speaker 1>took him down and strangled his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking,</v>

3374
02:28:46.580 --> 02:28:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

3375
02:28:48.471 --> 02:28:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Like that was the difference in like one</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy was like his big,</v>

3376
02:28:51.771 --> 02:28:53.930
<v Speaker 1>strong sort of progress or type </v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

3377
02:28:54.140 --> 02:28:57.120
<v Speaker 1>But the other one had that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stupid grappling strength.</v>

3378
02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:02.120
<v Speaker 1>They're remembered from some freaks in </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school when I wrestled in high </v>

3379
02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:02.120
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3380
02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:02.800
<v Speaker 1>when we were in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3381
02:29:02.860 --> 02:29:05.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain district and I went to the,</v>

3382
02:29:05.561 --> 02:29:10.561
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like the regionals and I </v>

3383
02:29:10.561 --> 02:29:10.561
<v Speaker 1>forget what it was called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3384
02:29:10.561 --> 02:29:14.270
<v Speaker 1>the guys had one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like certain tournaments would advance </v>

3385
02:29:14.270 --> 02:29:17.051
<v Speaker 1>to other tournaments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I got to see like the state </v>

3386
02:29:17.051 --> 02:29:17.060
<v Speaker 1>champion wrestlers and I got to see like</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the really high,</v>

3387
02:29:17.061 --> 02:29:19.000
<v Speaker 1>high level wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll never forget this,</v>

3388
02:29:19.180 --> 02:29:22.480
<v Speaker 1>the way that really good wrestlers could</v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate guys.</v>

3389
02:29:22.490 --> 02:29:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Like just toss them and throw them </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

3390
02:29:24.171 --> 02:29:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's like,</v>

3391
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:29.420
<v Speaker 1>just like anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's guys out there,</v>

3392
02:29:29.421 --> 02:29:31.790
<v Speaker 1>they're taking it to a very extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

3393
02:29:31.791 --> 02:29:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Unless you go and see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know that that's possible.</v>

3394
02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:38.710
<v Speaker 1>So when I first saw randy in the UFC and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took down that Tony Hallmark,</v>

3395
02:29:38.711 --> 02:29:43.711
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's immediately what it reminded me </v>

3396
02:29:43.711 --> 02:29:43.711
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

3397
02:29:43.711 --> 02:29:46.390
<v Speaker 1>What it reminded me of is the first time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'd ever seen real good amateur </v>

3398
02:29:46.390 --> 02:29:46.600
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers and went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3399
02:29:46.760 --> 02:29:51.760
<v Speaker 1>like this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is some shit to deal with right </v>

3400
02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:54.011
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you think you had a chance when he </v>

3401
02:29:54.011 --> 02:29:54.011
<v Speaker 1>fought the beater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like because he needed to beat all those</v>

3402
02:29:54.011 --> 02:29:56.410
<v Speaker 1>guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were the first guys he beat wearing good</v>

3403
02:29:56.450 --> 02:29:59.310
<v Speaker 1>caliber for the ice and then when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>stepped up to five feet or did you?</v>

3404
02:29:59.350 --> 02:30:01.550
<v Speaker 1>It was a big leap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a big leap.</v>

3405
02:30:01.580 --> 02:30:03.260
<v Speaker 1>It was his third fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fourth fight,</v>

3406
02:30:03.261 --> 02:30:05.830
<v Speaker 1>third fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did that one night go guys.</v>

3407
02:30:05.900 --> 02:30:08.270
<v Speaker 1>And then the next step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

3408
02:30:08.390 --> 02:30:10.970
<v Speaker 1>That really is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you stop and think about that.</v>

3409
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.780
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3410
02:30:11.781 --> 02:30:13.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we knew what he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of,</v>

3411
02:30:13.641 --> 02:30:16.160
<v Speaker 1>but it was really clear early on that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just,</v>

3412
02:30:16.161 --> 02:30:18.170
<v Speaker 1>his force of will was just too much.</v>

3413
02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Randy couture of the most amazing will </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

3414
02:30:20.770 --> 02:30:22.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look back to the first pedro,</v>

3415
02:30:22.461 --> 02:30:23.420
<v Speaker 1>his a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3416
02:30:23.421 --> 02:30:28.421
<v Speaker 1>Pedro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hit him with some of the most </v>

3417
02:30:28.421 --> 02:30:29.480
<v Speaker 1>horrifying leg kicks that have ever been</v>
<v Speaker 1>landed in an mma fight.</v>

3418
02:30:29.630 --> 02:30:33.740
<v Speaker 1>It took him six months to recoup his </v>
<v Speaker 1>legs to rehabilitate his legs.</v>

3419
02:30:33.741 --> 02:30:35.270
<v Speaker 1>After that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he showed me,</v>

3420
02:30:35.360 --> 02:30:38.980
<v Speaker 1>he still has a hole in his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muscle died in sport,</v>

3421
02:30:39.020 --> 02:30:41.090
<v Speaker 1>the muscle or die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about that.</v>

3422
02:30:41.300 --> 02:30:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Pedro Huizar kicks you so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The muscles die for forever in certain </v>

3423
02:30:46.300 --> 02:30:48.400
<v Speaker 1>spots on your fucking leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Randy go to her,</v>

3424
02:30:48.401 --> 02:30:50.720
<v Speaker 1>gone through that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then rehab for six months.</v>

3425
02:30:50.721 --> 02:30:52.940
<v Speaker 1>And then they talked him into a rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to do the rematch.</v>

3426
02:30:52.941 --> 02:30:54.450
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fight this fucking guy.</v>

3427
02:30:54.860 --> 02:30:56.810
<v Speaker 1>So they give them a rematch and he beats</v>
<v Speaker 1>them down again.</v>

3428
02:30:58.930 --> 02:30:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3429
02:30:59.540 --> 02:31:02.450
<v Speaker 1>I think he just knew there's no way I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting leg kick this time.</v>

3430
02:31:02.780 --> 02:31:04.400
<v Speaker 1>It just became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't become a,</v>

3431
02:31:04.580 --> 02:31:06.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you fight a certain guys,</v>

3432
02:31:06.381 --> 02:31:07.520
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3433
02:31:07.521 --> 02:31:09.950
<v Speaker 1>I can take a lead kicker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you fight Pedro Huizar.</v>

3434
02:31:09.980 --> 02:31:10.730
<v Speaker 1>You were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

3435
02:31:10.731 --> 02:31:11.940
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3436
02:31:12.020 --> 02:31:12.830
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3437
02:31:13.070 --> 02:31:13.910
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3438
02:31:13.940 --> 02:31:18.940
<v Speaker 1>People don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why I have such a </v>

3439
02:31:18.940 --> 02:31:18.940
<v Speaker 1>fetish for leg kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people always saying Rogan,</v>

3440
02:31:18.940 --> 02:31:21.860
<v Speaker 1>you're so fucking queer for leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They art.</v>

3441
02:31:21.920 --> 02:31:24.860
<v Speaker 1>It's because I've seen pedro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his old fight live and I've,</v>

3442
02:31:24.861 --> 02:31:27.810
<v Speaker 1>I've seen what's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what's possible when Kaiser.</v>

3443
02:31:27.811 --> 02:31:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Good man.</v>

3444
02:31:28.951 --> 02:31:30.600

3445
02:31:31.850 --> 02:31:33.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's because they're awesome when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they land.</v>

3446
02:31:34.210 --> 02:31:35.490
<v Speaker 1>They are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are scary.</v>

3447
