47
00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 1>versus him to the battle of the death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still winning that fight 10 times,</v>

48
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>10 times out of 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you wish the fight kept going 100%</v>

49
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird way to stop a fight too.</v>

50
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 1>When a guy's not taking damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just got a leg that's not working</v>

51
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:24.800
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

52
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>and the problem was too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.460
<v Speaker 1>he almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he basically called timeout and asked</v>

54
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 1>for the doctors to come in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you've done that,</v>

55
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:32.400
<v Speaker 1>the fight's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

56
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.720
<v Speaker 1>I think the ref literally thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>he should have just called the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

58
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.980
<v Speaker 1>He shake your leg was broken or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

59
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Like what did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was his thought process,</v>

60
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I guess?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

61
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:43.280
<v Speaker 1>and then the doctors came in and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started feeling around and they're</v>

62
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.841
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:43.841 --> 00:02:45.650
<v Speaker 1>they're like right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is Tibi is fractured.</v>

64
00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can feel the bone.</v>

65
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doc,</v>

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I promise you just get out of here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got to car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got an ink,</v>

69
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a calf cramp or something.</v>

70
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:53.820

75
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.020

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if it really works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I said,</v>

119
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:42.990
<v Speaker 2>like I wanted to send you a letter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

120
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.050
<v Speaker 2>I would put you as the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

121
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just switch return address and the</v>

122
00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:50.550
<v Speaker 2>sender address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Throw it in one of those blue mailboxes.</v>

123
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.971
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll go,</v>

124
00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:52.740
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no stamp returned to sender.</v>

125
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Now I sent you that letter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

126
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd probably know that one already.</v>

127
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably do you to do that with</v>

128
00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:02.460
<v Speaker 2>like a letter of they'll probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

129
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're probably like,</v>

130
00:05:03.591 --> 00:05:05.510
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd it get all the way over here</v>

131
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.190
<v Speaker 1>in the center?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's dropping off in California and so</v>

132
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:15.590
<v Speaker 1>we'll speed Ohio the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know better.</v>

133
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.940
<v Speaker 1>They know better today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

134
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.830
<v Speaker 1>They're smarter than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

135
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Famous con artists in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

136
00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:26.420
<v Speaker 1>It was like this little tome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's smaller than like the smallest</v>

137
00:05:26.421 --> 00:05:30.500
<v Speaker 1>paper back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was the biography of this guy,</v>

138
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Victor Lustig was his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was famous because he sold the Eiffel</v>

139
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Tower twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

140
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

141
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

142
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.290
<v Speaker 1>he had this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

143
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.920
<v Speaker 1>this scam that he called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was called the,</v>

144
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.350
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hungarian box.</v>

145
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to go back and look,</v>

146
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:55.340
<v Speaker 1>but basically what he would do is he</v>
<v Speaker 1>would get on a boat,</v>

147
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York,</v>

148
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 1>and he had this sort of beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mahogany box with a crank on it that had</v>

149
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:03.974
<v Speaker 1>two holes in it.</v>

150
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 1>And he would show all the guests that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>would put a blank piece of paper and one</v>

151
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>and turn a crank and a hundred dollar</v>
<v Speaker 1>bill would come out the other end.</v>

152
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he convinced them all that it was a</v>

153
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:19.750
<v Speaker 1>machine that made money and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

154
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 1>everybody would offer him an increasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money for this invention.</v>

155
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wouldn't sell it until the last</v>

156
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.293
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

157
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 1>when he would sell it for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 1>40 or $50,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he would disappear and jump off</v>

159
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>the boat and in France and never be seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

160
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:36.640
<v Speaker 1>People would tear it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

161
00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:38.180
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it called?</v>

162
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

163
00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:42.524
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>

164
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

165
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.850
<v Speaker 1>but that's exactly what the mortgage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me see his face.</v>

166
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.750
<v Speaker 3>Look at that fucking creep</v>
<v Speaker 3>lugging them.</v>

167
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.750
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me see that box again.</v>

168
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy.</v>

169
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.191
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

170
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:03.460
<v Speaker 1>so it was obviously fake and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

171
00:07:03.461 --> 00:07:05.630
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what the mortgage scam was.</v>

172
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:06.464
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

173
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.180
<v Speaker 1>they were taking basically blank paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

174
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.240
<v Speaker 1>these subprime loans that belonged to</v>
<v Speaker 1>janitors who we're gonna foreclose</v>

175
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:18.770
<v Speaker 1>within 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

176
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 1>And they were telling people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

177
00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>we have this new mathematical process</v>
<v Speaker 1>that allows,</v>

178
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:27.830
<v Speaker 1>that actually makes this stuff really</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe.</v>

179
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can put it in your,</v>

180
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your college endowment,</v>

181
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:37.850
<v Speaker 1>you can put in your pension fund.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so all of these people,</v>

182
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who his retirement monies were based on</v>

183
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 1>security is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're buying all this shit that they</v>

184
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 1>thought was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was aaa aerated.</v>

185
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they woke up and you know,</v>

186
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:51.470
<v Speaker 1>and in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2009 and they found their,</v>

187
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.200
<v Speaker 1>is where we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

188
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Speaker 1>wiped out by 40% or whatever it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

189
00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are losing their minds right now</v>

190
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:00.550
<v Speaker 2>over the past 24 hours because of Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

191
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.210
<v Speaker 2>And so what you're hearing is you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing a lot of the,</v>

192
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:03.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

193
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:05.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the critics of the current president,</v>

194
00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:09.170
<v Speaker 2>and apparently there are some that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

195
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:09.621
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

196
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:10.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in,</v>

197
00:08:10.101 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 2>she goes closer to a military conflict</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Iran.</v>

198
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.160
<v Speaker 2>Well these are the same brainiacs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It said he was entering as closer to war</v>

199
00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:18.770
<v Speaker 2>with North Korea and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was completely wrong on that.</v>

200
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that [inaudible] and the</v>

201
00:08:21.081 --> 00:08:23.240
<v Speaker 2>others in the Iranian regime might not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

202
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 2>decide to become more bellicose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

203
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're,</v>

204
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 2>I think they're looking at it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's this idea that,</v>

205
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause there's a couple of parts.</v>

206
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Part one is that they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

207
00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 2>look at what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

208
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.250
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have a plan b implying that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's either this deal,</v>

209
00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:39.590
<v Speaker 2>which even our European allies say is</v>
<v Speaker 2>inadequate.</v>

210
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

211
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.180
<v Speaker 2>or it's a military conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of what the previous</v>

212
00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:45.680
<v Speaker 2>president was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was all about.</v>

213
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:47.780
<v Speaker 2>We either get this deal or we're having</v>
<v Speaker 2>a military conflict.</v>

214
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other things in the works.</v>

215
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:52.880
<v Speaker 2>There's other options in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that decision tree.</v>

216
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I think that's,</v>

217
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 2>that's a false premise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing when they talk about</v>

218
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.110
<v Speaker 2>it over the past 24 hours anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

219
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:02.760
<v Speaker 2>well look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is gonna make it harder to get a</v>

220
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 2>deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Kim Jong,</v>

221
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:06.090
<v Speaker 2>none from North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cause he's going to think that we</v>

222
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't support our deals.</v>

223
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at it a different way.</v>

224
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 2>I think that Kim Jong Un is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this and think,</v>

225
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

226
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to put up with an</v>
<v Speaker 2>inadequate deal.</v>

227
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.700
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's gonna look at it and say,</v>

228
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:18.370
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

229
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because nobody disagrees with the</v>

230
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:21.624
<v Speaker 2>Iranian deal.</v>

231
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.680
<v Speaker 2>They want to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to talk about how it looked.</v>

232
00:09:24.681 --> 00:09:26.670
<v Speaker 2>The Iranians are complying with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

233
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:30.540
<v Speaker 2>the Iranians are complying with what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they agreed to allow him the deal,</v>

234
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is none of their military sites,</v>

235
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.040
<v Speaker 2>the number of times inspectors who have</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually gotten on and inspected a</v>

236
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 2>military site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including Parchin,</v>

237
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.870
<v Speaker 2>the most important military facility in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran since that deal was signed in 2015</v>

238
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:47.820
<v Speaker 2>was zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haven't been there because the Iranians</v>

239
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.590
<v Speaker 2>didn't agree to allow any of those sites</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this deal.</v>

240
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 2>So that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like saying,</v>

241
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.940
<v Speaker 2>that's like saying if you're a serial</v>
<v Speaker 2>killer,</v>

242
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.980
<v Speaker 2>you'll allow the police to come in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>search your home,</v>

243
00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:00.860
<v Speaker 2>but you can't go in the basement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

244
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Not that also he called was put their</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies in the basement,</v>

245
00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:06.780
<v Speaker 2>but I suspect that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

246
00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:08.750
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting thing and I,</v>

247
00:10:08.751 --> 00:10:11.450
<v Speaker 2>I guess I wanted to throw that out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>right off the bat because I think Iran</v>

248
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.060
<v Speaker 2>right now is consuming so much of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>oxygen for people out there.</v>

249
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.540
<v Speaker 2>So people thinking that the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're backing out of the deals,</v>

250
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:20.520
<v Speaker 2>because the presence being unreasonable</v>
<v Speaker 2>home,</v>

251
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:23.520
<v Speaker 2>we're forcing what you're just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a shit deal.</v>

252
00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:24.780
<v Speaker 2>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

253
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:28.920
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea that we have to stay in</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because it's better than the</v>

254
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:30.830
<v Speaker 2>alternative and the alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

255
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.900
<v Speaker 2>being a war is not framing it properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that,</v>

256
00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:40.490
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make any sense to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the fact that the UK,</v>

257
00:10:40.491 --> 00:10:40.801
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

258
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:41.670
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the French,</v>

259
00:10:41.671 --> 00:10:45.890
<v Speaker 2>the Germans have all agreed publicly</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's an inadequate deal.</v>

260
00:10:45.891 --> 00:10:48.240
<v Speaker 2>It needs to be fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That tells you something,</v>

261
00:10:48.241 --> 00:10:52.080
<v Speaker 2>but it also tells you that they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>real strong financial incentives for</v>

262
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.370
<v Speaker 2>continuing to do business in Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

263
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.400
<v Speaker 2>and as to Russia and China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly,</v>

264
00:10:56.401 --> 00:10:57.360
<v Speaker 2>the other signatories.</v>
