00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>being able to pick up a couch,</v>

7
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>being able to lift things that are heavy.</v>

9
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.790

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 1>one of the best exercises for improving athletics because when you're using</v>

15
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>something that requires you to use your whole body to lift,</v>

16
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>then your body gets used to working as a unit as opposed to the like the way</v>

17
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>they used to do it in the old school bodybuilder days where some people still do</v>

18
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>with where they isolate,</v>

19
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>like today I'm going to do biceps and triceps and tomorrow I'm going to do</v>

21
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>calves pitch that says you're going to,</v>

22
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a bunch of confused muscles that don't know how to work</v>

<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

24
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's strong,</v>

25
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>but nobody speaks to each other's language.</v>

26
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>You ever see like a really big goofy bodybuilder guy tried to try to fight,</v>

27
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 1>try throws punches of people.</v>

28
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>They fall down,</v>

29
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 1>they're all tipsy there.</v>

30
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 1>The whole body's designed fucked up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>some of them are so big these days that they kind of keep getting bigger.</v>

36
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's how bodybuilding works.</v>

37
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess that's what it is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sleep pig.</v>

147
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's muscles that don't even exist there.</v>

148
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.221
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

149
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 1>he's got a hand muscles lift his hand muscles.</v>

150
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen anybody with hand muscles like that?</v>

151
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:23.623
<v Speaker 1>It was the most,</v>

152
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 1>there's more muscles in his hand in there are in my torso.</v>

153
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Let me just tell you one thing that that guy works hard.</v>

154
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:30.371
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about it.</v>

155
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:30.941
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

156
00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 1>that guy does a lot of lifting and does everything scientifically incorrect,</v>

157
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>but what's fucked up is you can't even get there without steroids.</v>

158
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 1>You can't get there.</v>

159
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 1>You can't get there.</v>

160
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't exist.</v>

161
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 1>That's not a destination and your navigation system,</v>

162
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 1>it's his muscles look like they need to be ironed.</v>

163
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>It look wrinkled.</v>

164
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.620
<v Speaker 1>The only way you can get that big without the juice,</v>

165
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.990
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to scan so much.</v>

166
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what those lines are.</v>

167
00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:55.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like the skin looks like you could just tear it goes.</v>

168
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the striations of the muscle tissue underneath the skin.</v>

169
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 1>The skin is just so thin because their credit,</v>

170
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 1>incredibly dehydrated,</v>

171
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.270
<v Speaker 1>not just low on fat,</v>

172
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 1>not just massive amounts of muscle but insanely dehydrated.</v>

173
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.870
<v Speaker 1>That's not possible without a bunch of different factors and that look is</v>

174
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 1>extremely unhealthy.</v>

175
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.950
<v Speaker 1>That's really more performance art to me than it is like a sport.</v>

176
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.341
<v Speaker 1>Oh my.</v>

177
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I got the eye when I was competing in taekwondo tournament so I got down to four</v>

178
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:23.920
<v Speaker 1>and a half body weight,</v>

179
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.450
<v Speaker 1>four and a half percent body weight,</v>

180
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.910
<v Speaker 1>body fat by a caliper.</v>

181
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Now I've been told recently that that shit is not very accurate like calipers,</v>

182
00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>like you really got to get dunked underwater or do electrical thing.</v>

183
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>So you know I said four and a half percent and a bunch of people correcting me.</v>

184
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for correcting me cause I didn't know that the calipers were so bad,</v>

185
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>but that's what they told me.</v>

186
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 1>So like that would probably be like 7% or something like that.</v>

187
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.130
<v Speaker 1>If I was,</v>

188
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.641
<v Speaker 1>I was super,</v>

189
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:49.271
<v Speaker 1>super lean,</v>

190
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>but nothing compared to these guys with these guys are doing.</v>

191
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

192
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>I was working out with these guys are doing is like getting real to death while</v>

193
00:05:58.311 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>keeping giant muscles.</v>

194
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking madness.</v>

195
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.471
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

196
00:06:01.471 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 1>this is the nuttiest fucking sport of all time.</v>

197
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

198
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.070
<v Speaker 1>It's performance art.</v>

199
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.000
<v Speaker 1>This duck,</v>

200
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I will rip your Dick Clean Ass doors.</v>

202
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.600
