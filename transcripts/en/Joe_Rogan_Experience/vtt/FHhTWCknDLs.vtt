1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.680
Tell me when it's up for folks who just tuned in on Ustream.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.130
We just started talking about,
uh,
Sam Harris,
the big,
big fat Islamophobe.

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.400
What does that man,
is that it,
because they're brown,

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.690
is that because people are trying to be like super progressive?
Is that what,

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.250
whoops.
Yeah.
Um,
it's a,

6
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:23.040
it's a very dangerous irony and double standard.
It's really,

7
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.470
it's one of the most disturbing phenomenon,
I think,
uh,

8
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.730
to just to be found on the landscape.
Now.

9
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:33.660
It's a poor folks tuning in on Ustream just to keep you up to date.
Um,

10
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:36.920
we were talking about how you can make fun of Christianity with no problems

11
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:41.040
whatsoever.
I make fun of Mormonism.
Nobody cares.
But if you make fun of Islam,

12
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.950
progressive people will call you Islamophobic.
Yeah.

13
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:48.951
It's a combination of very understandable fears of racism and xenophobia.

14
00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:50.490
So we have this,

15
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.510
we're obviously trailing a legacy that we should be mortified by this theater,

16
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.290
a legacy of slavery and colonialism and,
um,

17
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.070
and all of that is something we should,

18
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.160
we should have a critical distance from and not wanting to recapitulate in any

19
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:11.490
form.
And so it,
it's,
it's important to be mindful of that obviously,

20
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:14.910
but there's this,
this,
um,
combination of,

21
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:19.911
of white guilt and political correctness and just sheer Stockholm syndrome and

22
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:25.020
some people that it has made it impossible to criticize Islam without being

23
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:28.130
branded a racist and Islam traditional.

24
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.720
Because if you're not going to buy traditional than conservative,

25
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:32.730
if you're not going to buy conservative than extremists,

26
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:37.731
there's some version of Islam that is the most odious ideology operative.

27
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:39.660
Now.
It is just,

28
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.950
it is a leading directly to the immiseration and millions of people.

29
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:47.280
And the moment you try to,
uh,

30
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.760
really draw a straight line and,

31
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.440
and myriad straight lines exist between that phenomenon and the actual doctrine

32
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:59.870
of Islam.
The actual idea said,
handed down from Muhammad,
you're accused of,

33
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:03.490
of bigotry and your leader put right next to Michelle Bachmann and any,

34
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.440
anyone else on the,
on the right who obviously you can't,
uh,

35
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.360
you can't ally within any sense.
Um,
so it's,
it's,
it's very,
um,

36
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.280
it's very troubling because,
because you have a,

37
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.500
those whole websites and magazines like salon and,
and um,

38
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.310
alternate and even the nation that just reflectively demonize anyone who has

39
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:27.630
said anything about Islam,
the religion that's negative and that's a,

40
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:31.020
it's a double standard.
We're going to have to overcome.
Salon goes hard,

41
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.500
they go hard with progressive silliness.

42
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.150
I mean they got mad at Patton Oswald for making a joke about someone making a

43
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:42.420
joke about Chinese accents like that.
It was so stupid.

44
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:46.350
It made them look so petty,
pedantic and silly.
It's just like,

45
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.491
what are you guys doing?

46
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:50.070
Like there's a lot of like real issues going on in the world.

47
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:52.800
There's a lot of real things to think about in this day and age.
Yeah.

48
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.550
I wrote a blog post about Malala Yousafzai the uh,

49
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.870
the 16 year old girl who was at 15 shot by the Taliban and was up for the Nobel

50
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:06.190
prize,
which she didn't win.
Uh,
but should have.
And My,

51
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.890
My blog post was totally praiseworthy of her.
I said,

52
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:10.660
she is the best thing to come out of the Muslim world.

53
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:14.080
And a thousand years she should've won the Nobel prize.
She's elegant,

54
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.450
eloquent and brave.
And um,

55
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.830
and the headline and Salon was Sam Harris,
slurs Malala.

56
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.850
And My slur was not,
uh,

57
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.590
basically accepting her view of Islam as the canonical Islam cause she's not an

58
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.710
atheist and I,
and,
and they,

59
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:33.130
they thought I was sort of Co coopting her as an atheist,

60
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:35.440
which obviously wasn't doing.
So it's just,

61
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:39.490
it's incredibly frustrating because so many smart people or otherwise smart

62
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:44.491
people are taken in by this because people really want to believe that all

63
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:48.160
religions are the same and that people everywhere the same and want the same

64
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:52.720
things.
And if we just got our act together on the world stage,
if we just,

65
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.650
if we just ceased to exploit people and we cease to be selfish and we just,

66
00:03:56.651 --> 00:04:01.360
and when we pulled back all the drones,
everyone would behave the same way.

67
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.140
We would have rational actors everywhere.
And there's just no evidence for that.

68
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:05.710
And,
and there's,

69
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.710
there's just as much evidence as you could possibly want to find for the

70
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:11.441
antithesis,

71
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:15.100
which is there are some people who are in a death cult who are certain of

72
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:18.520
paradise and very eager to get there.
Uh,
and they're not,

73
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:20.760
there's no talking to them.
And then there's a,
there's a,

74
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.080
a much vaster number of,
of people around them who support them,

75
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:27.030
who are not jihadists,

76
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.930
but who are basically aligned with them in terms of the worldview.
So,
um,

77
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.921
you know,

78
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:37.921
we have to win a war of ideas and we have to win a war and we have to be honest

79
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:39.604
about it.

80
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.630
<v 1>Yeah.
We,
we certainly do.</v>

81
00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:45.050
And there's this weird thing going on right now in Saudi Arabia where women are

82
00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:49.010
protesting,
uh,
the,
uh,
right to drive.
They're all driving.

83
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.930
And this is a big issue and it's crazy that in 2013 and that is directly related

84
00:04:56.331 --> 00:04:57.040
to religion.

85
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.790
<v 0>Oh yeah.
Yeah.
And it's,
it's incredibly edgy and risky to do.</v>

86
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:02.470
It's just amazing to get,
if you're a woman,

87
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.510
to get behind the wheel of a car in Saudi Arabia is a,
um,

88
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.220
a life disorienting risk,
you know,

89
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.500
to make that kind of social protest.
Um,

90
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.890
so if at best they're behind us by whatever,

91
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:25.750
50 years,
75 years in certain social,
um,
uh,

92
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.040
epiphany's,
you know,
so,

93
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:30.790
so if you roll back the clock in the U S and look at racism,

94
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:35.740
we don't really have the same analogous religious
brainwashing,
but,

95
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.760
but if you look at racism in the u s and what was going on in the,

96
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.300
in the teens and twenties and thirties,
it's just unthinkable.
Now,

97
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:45.730
let me just lynchings and,
and,
uh,

98
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.630
newspaper editorials that were starkly racism and they're there in newspaper

99
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:52.780
editorials,
not op eds,
but actually the editorial of,

100
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:56.520
of the New York Times and La Times,
uh,
in 1910,

101
00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.130
1915 that

102
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.380
<v 2>read exactly like a KKK pamphlet behind just,
just mind boggling.</v>

103
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.260
So at,
at the very least,

104
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:11.030
we have societies that have to catch up in their attitudes towards women and

105
00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:15.750
homosexuals and pluralism and atheism.
And,
uh,

106
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.770
we have to facilitate that process by not caving in when free speech issues come

107
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:22.701
up.
So when,

108
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:27.260
when someone draws a cartoon and the Prophet Muhammad and people start burning

109
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:28.094
embassies,

110
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.080
the move on our side can't be to apologize for cartooning and,
and to,

111
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:35.990
and to become self critical and masochistic about,
you know,

112
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:40.790
why is it that we had these cartoonists that did this terrible thing and,
and uh,

113
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:42.320
and that's,
and that's essentially what we did.

114
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:47.321
And we pulled all the no magazine with the exception of one a free inquiry in

115
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:51.710
the u s publish those cartoons.
There were totally benign cartoons.

116
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.810
You probably saw them that are available online.
But,
um,
we,
we,

117
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.120
we practiced self censorship to a degree that is just,

118
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.320
just astonishing and really just harmful to,
to,

119
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.450
to this,
um,

120
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.750
this conflict that both the hot and cold conflict that we're having,

121
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.010
it's caricature.

122
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.300
It's a caricature of a overblown reaction that you get from someone that maybe

123
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:23.591
was put in a situation where they will want to always use this as an excuse for

124
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:27.920
why things are like,
it's racism.
This is racism,
or you just hate women.

125
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:31.820
Like there's a bunch of these like,
oh,
you're Islamophobic.
It's like boom.

126
00:07:31.821 --> 00:07:35.890
They throw that on you,
this wet blanket.
And that.

127
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.370
It's a weird thing because you call it a cult.
And I agree with you,

128
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:42.020
but that's a very controversial thing to say.

129
00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:43.550
If you say that people get very upset with you,

130
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.910
but the reality is somebody is in a cult.
Okay,

131
00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:48.590
if you've got 20 different whatever,

132
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:51.290
how many different religions that are practice worldwide?
I don't know how many,

133
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:54.020
how many other,
well,
the probably hundreds,
but they're just,

134
00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:56.810
there's a big handful of main ones we care about.

135
00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:59.810
But the main ones who care about,
okay,
let's just say there's only four.

136
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.220
Someone's in a cult.
Someone's lying some day,
have four different stories.

137
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.810
So what's going on?
Who's telling the truth?

138
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.470
Someone's in a call and no one's willing to admit that this pie,
of course,

139
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:11.510
everyone believes the other people are in a cult.

140
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.380
But just the cognitive dissonance allow,
uh,

141
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:18.860
involved in picking some ancient ideology and thinking at some point in time,

142
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.440
somebody actually had a conversation with the divine,

143
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.930
wrote it down verbatim and it's perfect.

144
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.450
And it's never been touched by the hand of man or distorted.
It's,

145
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.650
it's weird that you get that from something like salon and that's essentially

146
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:32.510
what they're doing.
But calling you Islamophobia.
Yeah.

147
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.320
They're endorsing this idea that this wacky cult that makes you kill people,

148
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.500
they draw a picture of their guy.
Women aren't allowed to drive cars,

149
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.890
you suicide bombing.
And in this day and age,
it's like very,

150
00:08:42.891 --> 00:08:46.550
very common and religious based.
Sure.

151
00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:49.040
That's the most extreme faction of that religion.

152
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:54.041
And there's many people that are moderate Muslims who despise that as much as we

153
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:56.120
do.
But still it's,

154
00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.380
<v 0>it's an ideology and ideologies are real problems.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
the,</v>

155
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.580
the dispute is that,
uh,

156
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.930
the link that I'm drawing and that many other people draw between that behavior

157
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:09.360
and the religion is being challenged.
So,

158
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:12.050
so the people who had brand me as in Islam as a Llama,

159
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.200
Islamophobia would say that this behavior has nothing to do with Islam in

160
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:17.580
principle is that one,

161
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:22.260
you have extremists in every religion and they all misbehave or bad people will

162
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:26.770
do bad things anyway.
And,
and religion has always a pretext.
Uh,

163
00:09:26.771 --> 00:09:31.130
and that is just not true.
The scary phenomenon.
Um,
uh,

164
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:35.910
I think the most scary phenomenon really to be witnessed anywhere is that you

165
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:39.570
can have psychologically healthy,
rational,

166
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:44.640
otherwise competent and capable and charismatic people who have other

167
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.860
opportunities in life.
You know,
the,
the,
the good,

168
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:51.540
the quarterback of the football team can become a jihadist given the right

169
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:53.140
ideas,
uh,
and it,

170
00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:58.170
and if you just admit to yourself that certain people actually believe in

171
00:09:58.351 --> 00:10:03.000
paradise and believe that there's a specific way to get there that entails

172
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.610
violent,
defensive of the faith,

173
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.250
then it becomes totally rational to behave this way.

174
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.880
Then you and I would be flying planes into buildings if we actually believe
this.

175
00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:13.860
It doesn't matter what other opportunities you have in life.

176
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:19.140
And the thing that most secular liberals can't get their minds around is that

177
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.980
people actually believe in paradise.
People actually believe that,

178
00:10:21.981 --> 00:10:24.840
that that is certain book was dictated by the creator of the universe.

179
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.070
And it has provided a blueprint,
uh,

180
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.790
and a moral framework,
um,
that many,

181
00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:33.331
many people,

182
00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:37.500
millions of people believe it's perfect and unchallengeable for all time.

183
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:40.950
And then once you admit,
once you admit that,

184
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.920
you just have to look at the blueprint and this,
this particular blueprint,

185
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.560
it says a lot about a holy war,
uh,

186
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:51.780
and fighting the infidel and subjugating the infidel and killing apostates.

187
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.860
So,
you know,
if you,
if you convert to Islam now on this show,

188
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.710
and then by the end of the show is a,
a,
you know,
I thought better of it.

189
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.380
I don't feel like being a Muslim anymore.
I'm unconverted.

190
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.130
That is a crime punishable by death.
Uh,
and that's just,

191
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.320
that's not extremist Islam.
That's not,

192
00:11:07.321 --> 00:11:11.400
I was in a training camp in Afghanistan with 10,000 other lunatics,
Islam,

193
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.350
that is plain vanilla Islam.
Uh,

194
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.360
now you can sorta dicker around the edges of that dogma by saying,

195
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.900
you're dead to me or no,
you can't go that far,
unfortunately dead,

196
00:11:21.901 --> 00:11:23.160
but you're dead to me.
You can say,
well,

197
00:11:23.161 --> 00:11:27.390
the person has to speak out against the faith or repeatedly,
but you know,

198
00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:30.780
he has to be an obnoxious apostate.
But um,
you,

199
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:36.260
what you don't get are millions and millions of Muslims who belonged to some

200
00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:41.850
bonafide tradition of Islam who say,
oh no,
oh,
apostasy is fine.

201
00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:44.670
You should,
you should be free to change your mind about the faith.

202
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.780
And we don't care if you were once a Muslim and now you've become a Hindu or you

203
00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:52.190
were once a Muslim and now you become a Christian or an atheist,
that is,

204
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.640
that is fine with,
if,
if that existed,

205
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.500
well then you could just point to that brand of Islam and say,
well,

206
00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:01.210
I go over there guys.
That's the,
that's the Islam.
We should be encouraging.

207
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.860
But we have to,

208
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:08.220
and clearly we have to figure out some way to massage the faith into conformity

209
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:13.120
with that kind of pluralism and secularism.
But it's just not there.

210
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:13.900
And for,

211
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.900
for magazines like salon to pretend that that I'm killing apostates has no

212
00:12:22.031 --> 00:12:27.031
connection to the real religion of Islam is just a just pure delusion and it's a

213
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:28.743
dangerous one.

214
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:34.240
<v 1>It's also dangerous just to have a very strict ideology to have a thing that not</v>

215
00:12:34.641 --> 00:12:37.640
just you're supposed to do because the culture wants you to do it,

216
00:12:37.641 --> 00:12:42.620
but because God wants you to.
That's weird.
It's,
it's,
it's dumb.
It's weird.

217
00:12:42.621 --> 00:12:43.970
It's,
it's insane.

218
00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.840
If you think that in 2013 with the kind of access to information we have,

219
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.140
that we really believe that someone actually wrote this stuff down from the

220
00:12:51.141 --> 00:12:56.040
divine.
It's craziness.
It's a crit with Christianity,
whether it's Mormon is a,

221
00:12:56.041 --> 00:12:59.000
Mormonism is hilarious and Mormonism and Scientology are my two favorites

222
00:12:59.001 --> 00:13:01.250
because we know the guy who made them,
you know,
those are,

223
00:13:01.251 --> 00:13:04.440
and we know they were the Kahneman book,
not just con man,

224
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.440
way too much about them.
Yeah,
I'm an L.

225
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.850
Ron Hubbard was a fucking science fiction author.

226
00:13:07.851 --> 00:13:12.110
He me to science fiction religion.
I mean,
it's really beautiful in a way.

227
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.880
It's a hilariously beautiful,

228
00:13:13.881 --> 00:13:16.640
and someone like me who appreciates the folly of life,

229
00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.900
I can appreciate that in a big way.
I'm,
it's just,
it's,
it's like endless comedy.

230
00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:25.430
It's just so stupid.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What is it though?
Why do we need something?

231
00:13:25.431 --> 00:13:26.750
But why does everybody need something?

232
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.760
<v 0>But the,
the,
the,</v>

233
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.240
it's crucial that you acknowledge the difference between the various ideologies

234
00:13:34.241 --> 00:13:36.830
on offer because just how,
just believing,

235
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:41.560
believing that your worldview has come from God is not necessarily a deal

236
00:13:41.561 --> 00:13:44.950
breaker in terms of living in a global civil society.

237
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:49.240
If that worldview prescribes lots of benign things.
I mean,

238
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:54.270
so if you think God told you to be a vegetarian and never harm anyone and learn

239
00:13:56.231 --> 00:14:01.231
everything you can about science and mathematics and economics and become a,

240
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.850
a really energetic contributor to civil society,

241
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.110
if that's your religion,

242
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.610
well then you're never going to show up on anyone's radar is a dangerous person.

243
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.890
Um,
uh,
it's just the,

244
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:21.950
the main religions on offered don't have that kind of,
those kinds of ideas.
Uh,

245
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:26.290
and um,
you know,
they have first century and,
uh,

246
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.850
Iron Age,
uh,
platitudes and strictures that,

247
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.780
that have now been canonized in these books.
And there's just,

248
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.990
there's no way to rewrite the books.
He can't edit the book.

249
00:14:36.991 --> 00:14:40.300
So who people effectively edit the books by ignoring the most barbarous stuff in

250
00:14:40.301 --> 00:14:43.360
there.
But there's no way to say we're going to,

251
00:14:43.361 --> 00:14:48.361
we as Muslims where as Christians are going to craft a new scripture that's in

252
00:14:48.671 --> 00:14:51.750
line with all that we've come to learn about the universe,
uh,

253
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.460
<v 2>and follow that as though it were the word of God because the,</v>

254
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.940
they would know they were making it up and,
and that's um,

255
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.740
that's not satisfying.

256
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.380
Christians are funny because they ignore things conveniently.

257
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.430
Like I've met so many Christians that have Christian Bible quote tattoos.
Like,

258
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:08.570
did you read that thing?

259
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.330
You're not supposed to do that right to write on yourself.

260
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.510
Now he's supposed to use a magic marker and here you are getting a tattoo of a

261
00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:15.980
bible quote that's like,
you know,

262
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:19.640
God's like Jesus Christ did you pay attention to?
I said,
well,
it's a long book.

263
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.090
Unfortunately,
the Quran is not as long a book.

264
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.330
You can read the Quran in a weekend.
It's a much shorter book.

265
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.690
You read the Bible cover to cover,
it takes you a month and a half,

266
00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:31.480
but you read the Koran a,

267
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.080
it's a much more unified document and there's not,

268
00:15:36.081 --> 00:15:38.210
you can't cherry pick,
you can cherry pick out a little bit,

269
00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:40.100
but you can't cherry pick it in quite the same way.

270
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.450
You can't just take Jesus and half his moods the way you can as a Christian and

271
00:15:44.451 --> 00:15:47.090
say,
well,
this is all about turning the other cheek.
And I've got,

272
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.830
I don't care about hell and I don't care about
any of these culture war issues.

273
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.040
Um,
you just can't.
You really can't do that with Islam.

274
00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:57.440
And that's why this fusion of,

275
00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:02.390
of the religion and the politics is so difficult to,
to break because it's,

276
00:16:02.391 --> 00:16:04.730
it's explicit and there's just no,

277
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.600
there's no render unto Caesar those things that are Caesar's in the Koran as

278
00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:11.570
there isn't in the Bible.
So my favorite religion is Mormons.

279
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.140
They're the nicest people.
They're so sweet.
Yeah.

280
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.090
Like every time I've had a Mormon neighbor or you know,
meet Mormons,

281
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.050
they're the nicest people.
They're almost like child life in their belief,

282
00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:23.390
like childlike in their approach to religion.

283
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.460
Like my wife has a friend who's a Mormon.

284
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.880
I went up to dinner with her and her husband and uh,

285
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.950
somewhere along the line the subject of higher power came up.

286
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.670
She was grilling me like,
do you believe in a higher power?
And you know,

287
00:16:34.671 --> 00:16:36.810
basically I said,
well,
I don't not believe.
I don't know.
I mean,

288
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.990
who the fuck knows?
She's like,
you don't know if you don't know,

289
00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:41.510
how do you sleep at night for her?

290
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:44.120
Like someone had to tell her so she could talk herself in the bed like a little

291
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:46.070
kid,
like my five year old,
like,
sweetie,

292
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.630
God's Wachovia and everything's gonna be okay.
Okay,
cool.

293
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.280
Like now I can go to sleep.
For her,
it was very challenged.

294
00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:53.390
Fucking 40 year old woman.

295
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.600
Like she had this child like narrow tunnel of thinking that she prescribed to

296
00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.900
ex.
Mormons are awesome because there,
there's,

297
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.740
there's no group of people that are more energetic in their atheism.

298
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.750
And I've met them and an ex Mormons because they,

299
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:14.030
they're coming out of this thing that is just so obviously made up.

300
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.560
I mean,
he's like,
you got Joseph Smith as a dowser and a con man and um,

301
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:19.930
and 14,
and just,

302
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:24.990
and just getting it on with everyone's wife and just making up a principal's,

303
00:17:24.991 --> 00:17:25.441
you know,
he's gay.

304
00:17:25.441 --> 00:17:29.720
He gets new revelations to appease his jealous wife and he goes into the closet

305
00:17:29.721 --> 00:17:33.620
and God's,
and God tells him that he's got to have more hot girls.

306
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.220
So it's just,
and it's just so that it's just there in the,

307
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.330
in the flood lights of history to be inspected.
And so once they,

308
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.640
once they get out of it and they see just the,

309
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.970
they're trailing all this nonsense,
um,
they're very,
um,

310
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.040
they're very fun to talk to.
What is it about people

311
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.000
<v 1>that we need or some people need that they need,</v>

312
00:17:54.001 --> 00:17:55.560
that they need an ideology.

313
00:17:55.561 --> 00:17:58.890
They need a framework and the scaffolding to live their life on.

314
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.800
They can't just free ball it.
They can't just go,
who knows?

315
00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:05.280
Let's just figure out what we already know and apply that to wonder.

316
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.040
They can't do that.
They need an answer.

317
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:08.683
<v 0>Well,
uh,</v>

318
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.830
I wouldn't be the first to observe the death has something to do with it.

319
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.340
Is this anxiety about what it all means in light of the fact that at all

320
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.370
apparently ends,
um,
is really a,
um,

321
00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:26.240
a defense against grief.
You know,
the,
these beliefs,
a belief in paradise,

322
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.590
it's really the only thing you can tell yourself or tell another person or tell

323
00:18:30.591 --> 00:18:35.591
your child in the presence of death that makes death fundamentally,

324
00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.550
uh,
unproblematic I mean,
so,
so you're,

325
00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:42.890
you're the closest person to you in your life has died or your child has died.

326
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.940
And so what,
what are you going to say to yourself or to the people around you?

327
00:18:46.941 --> 00:18:50.390
Or what can they say to you that is just,
not only,

328
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.760
not only takes the sting out slightly,

329
00:18:52.761 --> 00:18:55.970
but it's just perfectly consoling if you could believe it.

330
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.320
It's this proposition that you're,

331
00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:02.060
you're going to meet again in some perfect place,
uh,

332
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:05.780
and you're going to spend eternity there and be perfectly happy.

333
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.890
And all you have to do is believe the right things in the meantime,

334
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.030
uh,

335
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:16.030
and not screw up too badly as a homosexual or it was whatever else is on the

336
00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:18.000
checklist of don'ts.
Um,

337
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.830
and you will get there and you'll be reunited with everyone you care about.

338
00:19:21.831 --> 00:19:23.030
And that,
and that is,

339
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:28.630
there is no secular or atheist or rational alternative to that.

340
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:33.470
And I mean that's,
that's a bullet I think we just have to bite.
Is there.

341
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.530
So there's not,
you know,
it at the graveside of a child.

342
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:42.160
The atheist doesn't have something to say that says this is not a problem.

343
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.110
You know,
this is,
your tiers are wasted,
uh,

344
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:51.400
and Christians and Muslims and Mormons and basically everyone who posits a

345
00:19:52.971 --> 00:19:57.050
heaven that you're,
that is assured based on the right beliefs.

346
00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:01.700
They do have something to say that,
that the,
the crowd buys into.

347
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:06.410
And there's no question that it relieves that suffering.
Now,
I think it's,

348
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.710
I think,
I think it comes with a,
uh,

349
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:14.300
a host of other problems that,
that,
um,
that even,

350
00:20:14.301 --> 00:20:17.240
that trade off is not worth it.
I mean,
if,
if,

351
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:21.770
even if we grant that's a certain kind of suffering is,
is,
uh,
relieved there.

352
00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.580
There's other kinds of suffering that spring up and,
but we,

353
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.260
people are not learning how to grieve.

354
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.560
They're not learning how to teach their children degree.
If they're not,

355
00:20:30.561 --> 00:20:34.850
they're not learning intellectual honesty.
They're not,
um,

356
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:40.370
uh,
and they're myered in a way of thinking that is constant,

357
00:20:40.371 --> 00:20:43.890
is co causing them constantly to collide with reality in,

358
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.470
in unfortunate ways that they,
they,
they,

359
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:52.560
they actually don't get what they want in life because they're believing things

360
00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:56.470
that,
that,
that just don't line up with how the world works.
And so you,

361
00:20:56.471 --> 00:21:01.390
I think it's,
it is,
if you,
if you look closely,
you can see that even that,
uh,

362
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.980
you know,
the best thing,
I mean,
the baby and the bathwater of,
of faith is,
um,

363
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.420
it's still dysfunctional.

364
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:12.820
<v 1>The Mormon friend,
she applied for a real estate license and didn't get it.</v>

365
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.880
She failed a test and she was upset.
She was like,
I'm a good person.

366
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.000
Why didn't I get it?
I'm doing all the right things and I'm a good person.

367
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.940
That's what she kept saying.
It's like being around a crazy person.
Yeah.

368
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.240
She just believes that if you do God's word,
good things going to happen to you.

369
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.400
I'm a good person.
Why didn't I get this right?

370
00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.490
While not looking at the fact that he's rich as fuck lives in a great house,

371
00:21:30.491 --> 00:21:33.160
has healthy kids.
Like there's all this wonderful stuff going on your life.

372
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:35.860
Like maybe just didn't apply herself enough to this whole real estate thing.

373
00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:38.450
So it's not going to do with God failing you.
All right.

374
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:43.360
Do you think that religion is something that's allowing human beings to make

375
00:21:43.361 --> 00:21:47.230
this jump from animals to enlightened,

376
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.510
connected beings?
It seems to me that with,
uh,

377
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.280
the connection that we're enjoying through technology,

378
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:58.030
through the Internet and through the,
the access of information,

379
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.100
it seems to me that we're,

380
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:04.120
we're slowly but surely dissolving all the boundaries between people and

381
00:22:04.121 --> 00:22:09.121
information and we're going to have much more truth about life and death.

382
00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:12.880
And the the very origins of the universe in a hundred years or a thousand years

383
00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:14.920
then we had a hundred years ago or a thousand years ago.

384
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.780
And I always wonder if like religion is something that's allowed us to keep our

385
00:22:19.781 --> 00:22:23.260
shit together just long enough for some really fucking smart dudes to figure out

386
00:22:23.261 --> 00:22:27.610
the internet,
keep our shit together,
just like keep together morally give,

387
00:22:27.611 --> 00:22:32.140
give these fucking crazy apes some sort of an excuse or a reason to live and you

388
00:22:32.141 --> 00:22:32.261
know,

389
00:22:32.261 --> 00:22:36.070
so they don't just go marauding and jump off clips out of despair and give them

390
00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:41.071
something that allows them to continue the work and that work being society

391
00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:46.530
ultimately moving towards some sort of technological innovation.

392
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.260
Zero point,
you know,
like everything we do,

393
00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:57.640
whether it's cell phones or laptops or cars,
every year it's better.

394
00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.030
No one ever goes,
we're good.
This is this cell phone.
I have this galaxy note.

395
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.000
No one's ever going to look at this and go,
this thing's perfect.
Okay,
we're done.

396
00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.410
We don't ever have to make another cell phone again.

397
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:09.760
We're going to continue to move forward faster speeds,
more connections,

398
00:23:09.761 --> 00:23:14.200
more apps,
more things that they can do,
holograms,
time,
travel,

399
00:23:14.201 --> 00:23:16.720
whatever the fuck it's going to be,
it's,
we're never going to stop.

400
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:21.080
And it almost sometimes I wonder if,
what,
what religion has,

401
00:23:21.081 --> 00:23:24.580
it's just like some sort of a scaffolding that lets us build society on.

402
00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:28.250
<v 0>Yeah,
I actually don't view it that way.
I think it's there,</v>

403
00:23:28.251 --> 00:23:33.200
there are people who think that religion paid every evolutionary dividends

404
00:23:33.201 --> 00:23:36.800
because it allowed large groups of people,
large groups of,

405
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:41.180
of kind of dimly related people,
you know,
not just just family,

406
00:23:41.181 --> 00:23:45.030
but larger tribes to cohere in a way that they couldn't otherwise.
So it's a,

407
00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:49.310
the way to get a bunch of strangers to cohere is to put a big idol in the corner

408
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.860
and say,
you know,
anyone who trespasses,

409
00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.790
the God is going to be killed.
Uh,
and we're going to,

410
00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:00.620
we're going to commit a sacrifice of a few kids,
uh,
you know,
every month or so.

411
00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.640
Um,
and keep everyone in line.
And we're going to,

412
00:24:03.641 --> 00:24:08.641
and outsiders who come into our world who don't understand are taboos.

413
00:24:09.261 --> 00:24:13.760
And our,
and our precepts are going to be easily recognizable as outsiders.

414
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.330
And so there's a long list of things that people think religion may have given,

415
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.420
uh,
our ancestors.
That may be true.

416
00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:23.420
I happen to think that that religion,

417
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:28.450
most of what explains religion is just more fundamental cognitive and emotional

418
00:24:29.811 --> 00:24:33.320
mechanisms that have nothing in principle to do with religion and which have

419
00:24:33.321 --> 00:24:37.340
also given us science and reason and everything else that,
that we,

420
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:41.920
that is recognizable as,
as human cognition.
So,
uh,

421
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.520
uh,
I mean,
I think the,
the most rudimentary piece here is belief formation.

422
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:51.550
You and I and every other human being who is neurologically intact has learned

423
00:24:51.911 --> 00:24:56.911
that comes into this world equipped to represent reality in language and to

424
00:24:57.141 --> 00:24:59.150
trade in those representations and to,

425
00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:01.520
and to give them credence to one or another degree.

426
00:25:01.521 --> 00:25:06.080
So you tell me where this the studio is.
I believe you.

427
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:10.160
I,
I,
it's just language,
right?
And,
and the,
the language got me here.

428
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.060
My belief in the language got me here.
Um,

429
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.540
if I thought that I had transcribed the address wrong,
um,

430
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.850
that belief would have caused me to call you and getting to make sure I got the

431
00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:23.280
eyes.
So I mean this is all just,
these are all just ones and Zeros in our,

432
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.020
in our computer at the moment.
But,
um,
uh,

433
00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:33.140
virtually the totality of our worldview is linguistically mediated in this way.

434
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:40.820
Um,
uh,
everything is not a matter of direct sensory perception in each moment.

435
00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.240
So a religion is just part of that is part of,

436
00:25:44.241 --> 00:25:49.241
it's the set of beliefs people form for which they have very loose evidentiary

437
00:25:49.641 --> 00:25:54.590
criteria and which govern,
uh,
all these no go areas for science.
Uh,
you know,

438
00:25:54.591 --> 00:25:59.320
what happens after death,
what is the meaning of life?
What is,
you know,
what's,

439
00:25:59.321 --> 00:26:02.700
um,
uh,
what's the most important thing,
uh,

440
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.910
to live for a and now I think,

441
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:09.050
I think actually reason Ken capture all of those conversations as well.

442
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.590
And it is in the process of doing it.
But,
uh,

443
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:17.020
it really is just a matter of believing certain propositions and the rules by

444
00:26:18.711 --> 00:26:22.820
which we,
we vet those beliefs when we are in conversation with one another.

445
00:26:22.821 --> 00:26:27.821
And the problem with faith is that it really operates as the permission.

446
00:26:28.161 --> 00:26:31.400
People give one another to believe things strongly without evidence.

447
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.160
And we don't give that permission in any other area of our lives.

448
00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:35.450
We don't give that permission in science.

449
00:26:35.451 --> 00:26:38.960
We don't give it an in politics a insofar as we're,
we're,

450
00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:43.990
we're practicing politics that anyone can tolerate.
Um,
and it a,
um,

451
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:49.830
that permission,
that the,
that the,
the taboo around criticizing that faith,

452
00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:54.930
um,
is something we've,
we're
hopefully getting over.

453
00:26:54.931 --> 00:26:59.700
We're going to have to get over it because it is the reason why people oppose

454
00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:00.361
gay marriage.

455
00:27:00.361 --> 00:27:05.361
It is the reason why people want laws that make a blast for me,

456
00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:10.390
a criminal offense.
Um,
and so that's,
um,
uh,
it's just a,

457
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.270
in so far as you actually believe something,

458
00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:15.070
it can't help but show up in the public sphere.

459
00:27:15.071 --> 00:27:17.820
And I believe people think beliefs are private.
They're not,

460
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.880
they're only private if there's nothing in your life or in the environment that

461
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:23.850
is calling them out.

462
00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:28.230
But the moment that they are relevant to your behavior,

463
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.860
they can't help but inform your behavior insofar as you actually believe them.

464
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:37.080
And that's a,
it's just,
Eh,
I mean,
this is an example I gave and,

465
00:27:37.081 --> 00:27:40.530
um,
and one of my books by as like a,
a belief,

466
00:27:40.531 --> 00:27:45.170
a true belief in the efficacy of prayer is dangerous.
If you,

467
00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:49.470
insofar as you really believe it,
you are going to be tempted to rely on prayer.

468
00:27:49.471 --> 00:27:51.660
You're going to be tempted to rely on prayer for your children.

469
00:27:51.661 --> 00:27:54.990
You've got these people that won't take their children to doctors because they

470
00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:57.570
think prayer is going to work.
I mean,

471
00:27:57.571 --> 00:28:02.070
imagine if you had a pilot who's,
who's trying to land the plane with prayer.

472
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.830
Uh,
it,
it's,
it's clear that,
I mean,
it's,
it's,

473
00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:07.230
it's a ridiculous example because we think no one would ever do that.

474
00:28:07.231 --> 00:28:08.370
But in some sense,

475
00:28:08.371 --> 00:28:11.910
people do that in situations where the stakes are just as high.

476
00:28:11.911 --> 00:28:16.911
And certainly everyone who's waging jihad thinks that their belief in paradise

477
00:28:17.761 --> 00:28:22.380
is,
is,
um,
is true.
And it's the,
it's the credence they give to that,

478
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:27.390
that real just pure language in the mind that is,
um,
is so dangerous.

479
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.493
Did religion,

480
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.190
<v 1>did religion ever play,
uh,
an important function in society?</v>

481
00:28:32.191 --> 00:28:36.360
Did it ever allow people to get past the barbarian ways and,
and,
uh,

482
00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.500
apply some sort of moral and ethical rules to,
to society?

483
00:28:40.501 --> 00:28:44.070
Did it ever have any function or any positive benefit that maybe wouldn't have

484
00:28:44.071 --> 00:28:47.910
come about if people were just a,
a bunch of savage tribal people?

485
00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:52.150
<v 0>Well,
yeah,
you can,
you can say that it did.
But see,</v>

486
00:28:52.151 --> 00:28:55.990
I look at it from the other side.
So,
so for instance,
when you say that,

487
00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:01.950
that when you look at all the good things Christians have done under the ages of

488
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.120
Christianity,
uh,
occasionally you can,

489
00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:11.980
you can point to something in the doctrine of Christianity that seems to be the

490
00:29:11.981 --> 00:29:13.440
operative variables so that the AUC,

491
00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.420
if that doctrine we're different behavior would be different.

492
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:20.680
But for the most part,
what you see is just people being,

493
00:29:20.681 --> 00:29:22.750
people trying to get what they want out of life.

494
00:29:22.751 --> 00:29:26.790
They're building bridges and they're learning about disease and they're,
they're,

495
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:31.600
they're,
they're trying to,
to,
uh,
develop a scientific principles.
Uh,

496
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:36.010
and it just so happens they're all Christians doing this.
And,

497
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:39.820
and w Christianity doesn't really get credit for the birth of science.

498
00:29:39.821 --> 00:29:40.990
It shouldn't get credit for the birth of,

499
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.150
it shouldn't get credit for all the bridges we built or,
or,
uh,

500
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:50.190
the roads we paved.
Um,
it's just,
there was no one else to do the job in,

501
00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.320
in Europe.
You know,
this,
this was the,
everyone was a Christian.

502
00:29:53.321 --> 00:29:58.321
Everyone came into this world and was indoctrinated into a worldview that they

503
00:29:58.451 --> 00:30:01.030
got on mother's knee.
And there was nowhere,
there was,

504
00:30:01.031 --> 00:30:04.680
there was no other worldview on offer.
So,
um,
I mean,
it's,

505
00:30:04.681 --> 00:30:06.940
it's just as true to say that everyone,

506
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.900
virtually everyone who ever fought a war or,

507
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.960
or saved a life or built a bridge did it in complete ignorance of Darwinian

508
00:30:18.311 --> 00:30:20.500
evolution.
Right?
That doesn't,

509
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:25.530
that doesn't mean that ignorance of Darwinian evolution was the crucial variable

510
00:30:25.901 --> 00:30:27.100
there,
or as a good thing,

511
00:30:27.101 --> 00:30:29.590
or it's something we should want to promote or that was something we should,

512
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:31.560
we should,
we should safeguard.
Uh,

513
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:34.810
it's just so happens that that prior to 1859,

514
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:40.360
this notion of evolution was not,
uh,
it was not an idea that had,
had,

515
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.320
had appeared in anyone's head.
And so,
uh,

516
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:46.330
there was no alternative but to not know anything about evolution.

517
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.180
And now we could have gotten,
if you,

518
00:30:48.181 --> 00:30:52.960
you could draw a line from and the ancient Greece,

519
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.290
uh,
and,
uh,
uh,

520
00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:01.380
give us a civilization with a very rich dialogue about ethics and about,

521
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:03.190
uh,

522
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:08.080
social norms that would not have needed to invoke the war God of Abraham.

523
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.340
Let me say like Plato,
uh,

524
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:15.310
could have given us the basis to think rationally about the good life and,

525
00:31:15.311 --> 00:31:19.300
you know,
Plato and everyone like emanation,
Greece.
Um,
and that,
that is a,

526
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:24.100
that is a stream of ideas that is unencumbered by,

527
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.950
uh,
this notion of,
of,
you know,
maybe,

528
00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.370
maybe there's an invisible monster out in the desert who wants a human sacrifice

529
00:31:30.371 --> 00:31:35.020
from time to time and maybe had a son who,
uh,
who died for our sins.

530
00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:38.770
Uh,
so it's,
it's a,
um,
so I know,
I don't think it's actually,

531
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.390
even if religion has seemed to do it in certain circumstances,

532
00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.550
I don't think it was actually a necessary piece.

533
00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:50.550
I think we are so deeply wired as social creatures to care about ethics that

534
00:31:52.091 --> 00:31:55.260
ethics was going to show up anyway.
So Christian ethics was not an editing,

535
00:31:55.261 --> 00:31:57.400
just Christian and Jewish and Muslim ethics.
We're not,

536
00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:00.460
not a necessary a scaffold for us,

537
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:04.990
but there's also examples of dehumanization of the other really common examples,

538
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:10.470
the way societies are allowed to look at their enemy as not being human and

539
00:32:10.751 --> 00:32:14.380
commit horrible atrocities because of that.
There's a,
a ton of examples of that.

540
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.870
Um,
well that,
that's our default.
Yes.

541
00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.590
Our default is the guys over in the next valley.
We don't know them.

542
00:32:20.591 --> 00:32:23.850
I mean it's a chimps have that,
right.
So you,
so chimps will band together in,

543
00:32:23.851 --> 00:32:28.851
in war park parties and kill other chimps who are,

544
00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:33.820
who are not part of their tribe.
Um,
if they happened out number them.

545
00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:39.210
And that is a behavior that clearly we tribalistic xenophobic violence is,

546
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:44.380
is,
is clearly something we are good at and,

547
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:48.890
and do reflexively in a,
um,
a state of nature.
Um,

548
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.470
so yeah,
I mean that's,
that's where we start.

549
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:56.090
So we overcome that by extending the,

550
00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:01.040
the circle of our morality and extending our,

551
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.900
our relationships with our economic relationships,

552
00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:10.460
our cultural relationships are,
are,
are peaceful collaboration with strangers.

553
00:33:10.461 --> 00:33:11.770
I mean,
that's what,
that's what civilization is.

554
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:16.730
Civilization is a machine to get us to peacefully collaborate with strangers.

555
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:19.120
And that's,
and the friend that,
you know,

556
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:24.080
the frontal cortex of every human brain is a machine that allows for that

557
00:33:24.081 --> 00:33:28.070
collaboration.
And it's if you damage that in a,
in an individual,

558
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:32.080
you get a,
uh,
I mean there's many different pathologies there,
but one is,

559
00:33:32.081 --> 00:33:33.890
is psychopathy may wouldn't say that we,

560
00:33:33.891 --> 00:33:35.570
if you have the right damage to your brain,

561
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:40.370
you are someone who sees no basis for collaboration.

562
00:33:40.371 --> 00:33:43.040
You don't feel empathy for other people.
Uh,

563
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:47.330
you either don't care that you make them suffer or you,

564
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.950
you actually take sadistic pleasure in making them suffer.
And uh,

565
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.910
you,
uh,
this,
the,

566
00:33:55.410 --> 00:34:00.410
the very basis for trust breaks down in relation to such a person and they're,

567
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.020
what I would argue is that there are actually cultures that are,

568
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.020
for all intents and purposes,
psychopathic.

569
00:34:09.021 --> 00:34:13.310
There is in which you can put perfectly normal individuals,

570
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.910
people who are neurologically intact,
who don't have any of the,

571
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:21.980
the anatomical problems of,
of psychopaths,
but put them into a,

572
00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:23.080
a system,

573
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:27.410
a system of poorly aligned incentives and bad ideas.

574
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.660
And they essentially act like psychopaths.
The,
the,

575
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:33.890
the guy who got on the bus and shot Malala and the head for,

576
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:36.530
uh,
uh,
wanting to go to school.

577
00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.230
I mean that's essentially what happened to the Taliban.

578
00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:44.490
A Taliban gunman tried to assassinate a 15 year old girl for the crime of

579
00:34:45.741 --> 00:34:50.540
wanting to get an education.
Most people look at that and think,

580
00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:54.740
well he must,
he must have been a psychopath or he must have been crazy.

581
00:34:55.310 --> 00:35:00.110
And I think the situation we are in is far more sinister than that.

582
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:05.710
He very likely was a perfectly normal person per and very likely a father who

583
00:35:07.701 --> 00:35:09.830
thought he was doing a good thing.

584
00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:14.860
And in every other moment in his life it was probably a nice guy.

585
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:18.720
Probably a compassionate guy,
probably a guy who's capable of empathy jump.

586
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:19.880
Why would you know that?
Well,

587
00:35:19.881 --> 00:35:23.060
because you just have to look at the kinds of atrocities that normal people

588
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.530
perpetrate Ian in mass movements that are,

589
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.510
for want of a better word,
evil.
So you let me look at Nazi Germany.
How was the,

590
00:35:32.511 --> 00:35:33.980
how did the Holocaust occur?

591
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:39.160
It was not that there were hundreds of thousands of eager to collaborate in the

592
00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:40.830
destruction of a people.

593
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:45.570
There were a lot of normal people who given the requisite ideas and the

594
00:35:45.571 --> 00:35:48.940
requisite incentives.
And,
and,
and the,

595
00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:53.970
the ability as you described to dehumanize the other just saw no prom.

596
00:35:54.201 --> 00:35:55.140
And they could,
they could,

597
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.140
they could burn people in gas chambers by day and go home and,

598
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:04.190
and shed a tear over Wagner at night and play with their own kids and that,

599
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:09.420
that disjunction morally,
uh,
never had to be inspected.

600
00:36:09.421 --> 00:36:12.090
Now obviously there's some people who are racked by guilt and some people who

601
00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:15.230
refuse to collaborate.
But,
um,

602
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.730
I mean this is one of the scary features of the human mind.

603
00:36:17.731 --> 00:36:22.731
It's possible to be an otherwise good person and do horrible things in the right

604
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.630
situation.
And that's not to say that there aren't psychopaths who,

605
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.690
who are evil and,
and essentially monsters,
but,

606
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.720
but normal people are capable of terrible things.

607
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.420
And in the context of certain religious ideas,

608
00:36:36.421 --> 00:36:40.740
I think it becomes quite rational for them to,
to,

609
00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.230
to perpetrate evil.
I agree with you,

610
00:36:43.231 --> 00:36:46.560
but I don't think there's any evidence that this guy was like a normal,

611
00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:50.310
nice guy in everyday life.
I just don't understand why you would assume he was.

612
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:53.580
I know it is assumed that if everyone knew that she was going to school and

613
00:36:53.581 --> 00:36:56.610
there were so many people that knew it would take an extreme version of that

614
00:36:56.611 --> 00:37:00.960
ideology in order to get on a bus and shoot a 15 year old girl since a little

615
00:37:00.961 --> 00:37:04.110
kid.
Well,
I,
so let me just say,

616
00:37:04.111 --> 00:37:07.900
I know nothing about this particular person.
I'm just guessing.
But,
uh,

617
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:12.220
I think there's no reason to believe that,
uh,

618
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:18.080
every member of the Taliban or every member of al Qaeda is a psychopath or

619
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:19.640
isn't,

620
00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:24.330
is a person who would otherwise do terrible things to innocent strangers.

621
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:27.210
Um,
I,
there's,
there's no reason to believe that.
And there's,

622
00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.070
there are many reasons to believe otherwise,

623
00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:33.570
and you can just look at how people get radicalized and,

624
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:37.080
um,
it's not,
you don't have to,

625
00:37:37.081 --> 00:37:40.640
you don't have to round up all the Jeffrey Dahmers of the world and,

626
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.040
and brainwash them and turn them loose.
It's,

627
00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.040
they're far more functional people than that.
Um,

628
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:51.990
isn't that what we do when we train troops?
Well,
we,
yeah,
we do it.

629
00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:56.910
You can even go into a more,
um,
uh,

630
00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.160
Eh,
a stranger direction in that way.

631
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:04.240
When you look at what a surgeon has to do just to cut into a human body,

632
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:09.880
there's a kind of desensitization desensitization and,
and a,

633
00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:14.280
a shutting down of empathy that the kind of normal circuits of empathy and

634
00:38:14.281 --> 00:38:18.120
compassion,
uh,
to do that.
So,
so you and I,

635
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.250
in the presence of the suffering we would see in an,

636
00:38:21.251 --> 00:38:26.251
in an er say would probably be a physiologically and emotionally really,

637
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:32.850
um,
uh,
over amped up because it,
we're not used to it and we just,

638
00:38:32.851 --> 00:38:36.370
we can't,
you know,
we see someone in tears with,
you know,
a major wound

639
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:40.180
<v 2>or a broken arm and all of our empathy circuits kick in.</v>

640
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:42.410
And we're not very useful in that circumstance.
I mean,

641
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:47.220
leave aside for the moment that we actually don't know what to do.
Uh,

642
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:49.510
even if we did know what to do,
the,

643
00:38:49.511 --> 00:38:54.511
the a and e flux of empathy in that moment is not especially useful and you to

644
00:38:56.201 --> 00:38:58.660
be a great,
you know,
trauma surgeon.

645
00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:03.130
You want to be somebody who is not distracted by the tiers and,

646
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.680
and you know,
the,

647
00:39:04.681 --> 00:39:08.140
the obvious signs of human suffering and who can just deal with this like a

648
00:39:08.141 --> 00:39:12.040
machine that has to be fixed.
Uh,
and there's,
there's something,

649
00:39:12.041 --> 00:39:15.520
there's even a point of contact between that ability just to kind of shut out

650
00:39:15.521 --> 00:39:19.670
the other human stuff and deal with the machine that is,

651
00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.420
is on a continuum with this,

652
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.480
this cognitive emotional gesture of dehumanizing the other.

653
00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.420
Um,
and just,
just seeing no,

654
00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:35.320
no moral implication in just blowing up bodies.
I see what you're saying.

655
00:39:35.321 --> 00:39:38.530
So it's essentially you're talking about a broad spectrum of possibilities of

656
00:39:38.531 --> 00:39:39.670
the way the mind operates.

657
00:39:39.671 --> 00:39:43.330
And there's some people that can learn how to shut things off and that's what

658
00:39:43.331 --> 00:39:45.220
you're doing when you're a soldier.
You just learn how to,

659
00:39:45.221 --> 00:39:47.760
this is your new reality.
Um,
there was,
uh,

660
00:39:47.761 --> 00:39:50.680
an article recently where they interviewed that guy who,
uh,

661
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:55.950
who's a soldier who got in trouble because he was urinating on a dead insurgent

662
00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:57.610
and they interviewed him.

663
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.860
And it was really interesting because he was very honest about how he felt about

664
00:40:02.861 --> 00:40:07.450
the situation.
He said that people have this idea of what they want.

665
00:40:07.451 --> 00:40:08.380
Adam a marine,

666
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:13.410
they want a guy who's on the commercial who slides the sword into the holster or

667
00:40:13.421 --> 00:40:17.410
the scabbard and stands up straight and is wearing a perfectly trim suit.

668
00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:20.650
And you don't want a guy who's gonna piss on a dead guy,
right?

669
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:24.520
But you don't get one without the other.
You don't,
you don't get a killer.

670
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:27.610
You don't get a guy who doesn't have total disdain for the enemy.

671
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:31.810
And that's what develops.
You see your friends die,
you see those around you die.

672
00:40:31.811 --> 00:40:33.290
You see these people shoot at you,
you,

673
00:40:33.291 --> 00:40:36.370
you developed total disdain that it's okay to kill people,

674
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:39.190
but it's not okay to pee on them.
Gets a real weird,

675
00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.560
and I'm not saying that it's okay to pee on people.

676
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:43.960
I'm certainly not saying that it's okay to kill people either.

677
00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.560
But I'm saying it is weird that we get mad at one and not the other.

678
00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:50.770
It's almost like there's a thing about sexuality that's,

679
00:40:50.771 --> 00:40:53.200
I always found really odd.
You can't watch sex,

680
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:57.640
but you can watch graphic violence.
You can put a movie and if it's sex,

681
00:40:57.641 --> 00:40:59.710
it's everything.
There's legs covering,

682
00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:03.220
there's angles and you don't ever see genitals if except it's very brief and

683
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:06.430
there's no actual intercourse.
We not allowed to show intercourse.

684
00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:09.100
Intercourse is somehow or another ridiculously taboo,

685
00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:12.940
but we can watch people's heads explode on regular television.

686
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:14.560
The walking dead is just,

687
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.800
every episode is just booms slash fucking swords cut heads off and guns blow

688
00:41:20.201 --> 00:41:23.060
people up and were weird.
Yeah.
Yeah.

689
00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.740
And some of that weirdness can be laid at the feet of religion.
I mean there's,

690
00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.390
there's obviously the,

691
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:33.890
the conditioning we have around sexuality has religious norms

692
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.380
<v 0>hammered into it.
And,
um,
yeah,
it's,
uh,</v>

693
00:41:38.381 --> 00:41:41.310
it's always been strange to think that that,
uh,

694
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:46.500
very explicit violence is,
um,
something just,

695
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.470
just acceptable entertainment and,
uh,

696
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:56.240
any kind of sexuality,
whether it's,
you know,
objectifying or,
or obviously,

697
00:41:56.270 --> 00:42:00.970
you know,
romantic and,
and,
and,
uh,
imbued with love is,

698
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.590
is so charged that we have to protect people from it.

699
00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:08.140
And in very careful ways.
I think the,
um,
I don't know that,
that,

700
00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:12.290
that story,
but the,
the marine,
um,
I don't know whether that's true.

701
00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:15.380
I think it's close to something that must be true.
What do you mean,

702
00:42:15.381 --> 00:42:18.560
what part is true?
Well,
just whether,
whether you can't get one without the other.

703
00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:21.060
Oh yeah.
I don't know whether you need,
um,

704
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.020
clearly in order to,
uh,

705
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:30.550
function in that mode of defending yourself and your buddies against the threat

706
00:42:31.131 --> 00:42:35.390
of the enemy and killing the enemy wherever you find him,
um,

707
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.090
that is a,
um,
uh,

708
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:43.190
that's a mode in which you can't be thinking about how the enemy has kids just

709
00:42:43.191 --> 00:42:47.210
like you and is eager to get home to his wife.
And I mean,
that's,
that's just not,

710
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.130
that's not helps.
Uh,

711
00:42:49.131 --> 00:42:53.840
and it's easy to see why that would start to get drummed out to you.
Uh,
so,
um,

712
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:55.590
and it's,
I mean,

713
00:42:55.850 --> 00:43:00.040
it's a huge problem that we can dehumanize other people.
Uh,

714
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:04.910
it's also a huge problem that we can be part of systems and collaborate in ways

715
00:43:04.911 --> 00:43:08.930
which effectively destroy other people's lives.

716
00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:10.580
And we don't even notice it.

717
00:43:10.581 --> 00:43:13.730
We don't even have the mechanism by which we would notice it and we don't see,

718
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:18.300
um,
we just don't see that,
that the,
we,

719
00:43:18.301 --> 00:43:21.490
there is a kind of a zero sum game here,
uh,

720
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:24.520
in the bow operating in the background,
which we are all,
we,

721
00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:28.560
we can't help it participate in which leaves,
you know,

722
00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:33.700
people try to eek out their survival from trash heaps in developing nations.

723
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:39.470
Uh,
and you and I wondering whether we should get the,
the IPAD air,
uh,

724
00:43:39.471 --> 00:43:44.090
and there's,
there's no way to really square in,
in a,

725
00:43:44.091 --> 00:43:48.870
in a moral,
ethical sense the way we use our attention in that space.
So it's a,

726
00:43:48.871 --> 00:43:50.000
so it's like there's,
there's no,

727
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:55.030
there's no clear way for me to help the person on the trash heap in wherever,

728
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:57.283
Nairobi

729
00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.720
because set just cutting another check to the Red Cross or UNICEF or Doctors

730
00:44:05.271 --> 00:44:09.190
Without Borders.
That's,
you know,
while,
while that's a good thing to do,
uh,

731
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:13.250
it's this sort of telescopic philanthropy where it's,
there's not a,

732
00:44:13.251 --> 00:44:16.040
not a real connection that it's not a real imperative,
you know,

733
00:44:16.041 --> 00:44:20.990
so when I get a mailing from a charity,
you know,
help another person who's,

734
00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:24.740
who's near starvation in,
in East Africa,
uh,

735
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.300
my failure to do it,
my disinclination to do it.

736
00:44:29.301 --> 00:44:34.301
My sense that I've got better things to do than open this junk mail never shows

737
00:44:34.831 --> 00:44:38.330
up in,
in my mind or in,

738
00:44:38.331 --> 00:44:43.331
in my conversation with anyone else as a shocking misuse of my resources.

739
00:44:44.191 --> 00:44:46.260
And that this is not,
this is,
this is a what I'm,

740
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:50.500
what I'm in a very loose way.
I'm sketching a,
um,

741
00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.560
a series of thought experiments that,

742
00:44:52.561 --> 00:44:57.380
that people like the philosopher Peter Singer and Peter Unger have,
um,

743
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:59.990
uh,
put in,
um,

744
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:04.340
really blisteringly clear ways where you,
where,
where

745
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:09.230
we all seem to justify to ourselves,
um,

746
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:13.920
by default is living in a way where we,
we,

747
00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:17.730
we care about our own happiness to a much,

748
00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:22.760
much greater degree than we could possibly justify in the presence of someone

749
00:45:23.701 --> 00:45:28.290
else's abject suffering.
And because we're not in the presence,
I mean,
if,
if,

750
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.880
if after this podcast,
you will,

751
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:34.440
you and I walk out onto the sidewalk and see someone's starving to death in

752
00:45:34.441 --> 00:45:37.020
front of us,
see it,
you know,
a child starving to death,

753
00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:39.840
we wouldn't be able to ignore it.
There's just no,

754
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:42.470
it's just a clearly as our responsibility to figure out,
you know,
we,

755
00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.820
we have to call the authorities.
We have to get some food.

756
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:47.150
We have to get a blanket,
we have to do something.
Um,

757
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:52.950
but because it's happening in another society and w and the only evidence of it

758
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:57.150
that,
that has been thrust in our face at this moment is an appeal by email or a

759
00:45:57.151 --> 00:46:01.710
letter.
Just hitting delete doesn't,

760
00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:03.990
doesn't strike us as the,

761
00:46:03.991 --> 00:46:07.620
as analogous to stepping over the body of a child on the sidewalk and say,

762
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.530
saying the saying it's not our problem.
And it really,

763
00:46:10.531 --> 00:46:13.920
in a global society,
it is analogous.

764
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:18.090
And yet we don't have the mechanisms in place to make it,

765
00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:23.340
um,
friction free for us to feel the imperative,

766
00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:26.550
uh,
and care about suffering and elsewhere.
And we,

767
00:46:26.551 --> 00:46:29.820
and we have to clearly we have to figure out how to do that as a species.

768
00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:34.240
<v 1>Yeah,
it is.
It's almost overwhelming.
Well,
it's not almost overwhelming.</v>

769
00:46:34.241 --> 00:46:36.430
It's totally overwhelming.
The,
the sheer numbers,

770
00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.050
you'll look at the amount of people in Africa that have aids look at,
you know,

771
00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:44.050
the amount of people in Third World countries that are struggling to find food

772
00:46:44.051 --> 00:46:46.960
every day.
It's the sheer numbers.
When you look at India,

773
00:46:46.961 --> 00:46:49.030
there's a billion people in India.
It doesn't like,

774
00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:51.640
I think 500 million or something live in total poverty.

775
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:56.440
Something crazy like that.
I mean,
I just made that number up totally probably.

776
00:46:56.441 --> 00:47:00.790
Right.
It's not,
not far off.
It's probably right.
Um,
but that,
that seems like Cobb,

777
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:02.290
yeah,
I'm just going to go to the fucking store.

778
00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.630
I don't know if I have time to do this.
I got to take care of my kids.

779
00:47:04.631 --> 00:47:07.340
I got to go to dance class.
You know,
it's like there's,

780
00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:12.250
at a certain point in time,
it seems like it's not your responsibility.

781
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.280
There's these diffusion of responsibility that comes in large numbers that

782
00:47:15.281 --> 00:47:19.420
allows people to ignore a rape if there's a hundred people around and not if

783
00:47:19.421 --> 00:47:22.330
there's one.
Right.
You know,
they've talked about that before.

784
00:47:22.331 --> 00:47:26.500
Like people can watch people get robbed in Times Square and not do anything

785
00:47:26.501 --> 00:47:28.030
about it because they're surrounded by other people.

786
00:47:28.031 --> 00:47:30.940
They're waiting for someone else to a move.
It's okay to be a coward,

787
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:34.750
but if you alone in the woods and you saw some man beating some woman to death,

788
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.750
you would feel compelled to try to do something.

789
00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:40.950
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
Well actually to,
to segue to questions of self defense.</v>

790
00:47:40.951 --> 00:47:45.540
I think that that diffusion of responsibility idea has been oversold because I

791
00:47:45.541 --> 00:47:45.900
think,
yeah,

792
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:50.900
I think more of what's going on for people is they don't want to be the first

793
00:47:51.151 --> 00:47:54.780
one to get stabbed.
You know,
many of those situations,

794
00:47:54.781 --> 00:47:58.870
you've got somebody with a weapon.
It's not just a guy as a guy with a knife.
Um,

795
00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:03.720
and uh,
and especially in that case,
the original case,

796
00:48:03.721 --> 00:48:06.360
the Kitty Kitty Genovese case where,
um,
uh,

797
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:09.240
that notion of diffusion of responsibility was coined.

798
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.680
You had a guy with a knife stabbing a woman to death on a sidewalk,
um,

799
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:17.400
over the course of many minutes.
And there were many witnesses.
Uh,

800
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:19.170
but the,

801
00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:24.800
the problem from the point of view of the herd is the first guy to rush the guy

802
00:48:27.061 --> 00:48:31.380
with a knife is very likely going to get stabbed and terribly injured or killed.

803
00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:33.690
And maybe the second guy is too.

804
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:37.920
But if five people rushed him at the same time,
if there was some sort of,

805
00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.920
you know,
tactical intelligence in the group,

806
00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:45.480
very likely he could be taken down and,
and neutralized.
And that would,

807
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:48.180
and you know,
maybe someone would still get hurt,

808
00:48:48.181 --> 00:48:52.440
but it's not going to be like one guy after the other getting a fatal stabbing.

809
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:54.910
Um,
and that's,
uh,
it's just,

810
00:48:55.080 --> 00:49:00.080
it's a problem we have in that people are frozen in people freeze and no one

811
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:06.570
wants to be,
I mean,
we don't have this,
we don't have the knowledge tactically,

812
00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:08.010
uh,
uh,

813
00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:12.900
among untrained people that if you all go in at once,

814
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:16.950
you have a very good shot at bringing down,
even a very scary looking guy.

815
00:49:16.951 --> 00:49:18.330
You know,
if you take,
if you take,

816
00:49:18.331 --> 00:49:21.270
if you hit him low and I hit them high and another and another person hits him

817
00:49:21.271 --> 00:49:23.940
in the middle,
it doesn't matter who he is.
You know,

818
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:28.440
if he's got 380 people,
100,
180 pound guys hitting him,

819
00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:33.330
um,
it's,
uh,
we're going to bring him down.
And,
um,
you know,

820
00:49:33.331 --> 00:49:36.090
obviously we have training and that's a,
that's all the more likely,

821
00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:38.720
but it's what we need in,

822
00:49:38.721 --> 00:49:43.200
in situations like that are people who are going to take responsibility for the

823
00:49:43.201 --> 00:49:44.570
safety of others.
You know,
the,
the,

824
00:49:44.571 --> 00:49:48.960
the innocent bystander or whether you're talking about bullying in schools among

825
00:49:48.961 --> 00:49:52.860
10 year olds or you're talking about crime in public,

826
00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.570
it's the fact that we're,
we're so willing to be just bystanders.

827
00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:01.260
Um,
that's,
that's a,
a problem that creates a lot of suffering.

828
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:03.440
<v 1>Well,
in this soft society that we have,</v>

829
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:08.480
our society is so soft and nice and it's the easiest society that's ever

830
00:50:08.481 --> 00:50:09.110
existed.

831
00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:12.920
There's not a lot of conflict and people's lives and new things like conflict or

832
00:50:12.921 --> 00:50:13.754
terrifying,

833
00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:17.060
especially physical conflict with another human being wants to hurt you.

834
00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.210
It's absolutely horrifying.
I've told the story in the podcast,

835
00:50:20.211 --> 00:50:22.340
but I'll tell it again for you.
I was watching a guy,

836
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.910
it was at the comedy store and there was two guys arguing and they were in the

837
00:50:25.911 --> 00:50:28.220
middle of the street across from the House of Blues

838
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:32.030
<v 2>and they started arguing.
I don't know what happened.
I just,</v>

839
00:50:32.031 --> 00:50:36.260
I saw it in the middle of it and they start swinging at each other and it was a

840
00:50:36.261 --> 00:50:40.850
white guy in a black guy and the white guy just went into full panic mode and

841
00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:45.860
was literally standing square and just flailing,
closing,

842
00:50:45.861 --> 00:50:48.020
closing his eyes with his open hands flailing.

843
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:50.900
And then a bus pulled in front and I couldn't see them anymore.

844
00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:53.000
And then as soon as the bus moved,
he was unconscious.

845
00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.260
I didn't see what happened to him.
That's very cinematic.
Yeah,
it was.
It was.

846
00:50:57.261 --> 00:51:01.430
It really was.
But I've never forgot that because I saw,

847
00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:04.790
I knew what it was.
Cause I've seen people fall apart before.
You know,

848
00:51:04.791 --> 00:51:08.600
I've seen it,
I've seen it in much lower levels in fights,

849
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:12.590
but to see it in that this street fight I've seen in competition,

850
00:51:12.591 --> 00:51:16.610
I've seen people be intimidated and not perform to their ability or be paralyzed

851
00:51:16.611 --> 00:51:17.444
by the moment.

852
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:20.030
It's a lot of people don't know what to do when the shit hits the fan.

853
00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:24.230
We never have to,
we don't have any character.
But the truth is you don't,

854
00:51:24.231 --> 00:51:29.140
even 10 people don't really know what have to do with what the hell would they

855
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.631
have to do it.

856
00:51:29.631 --> 00:51:33.920
As long as they're going to all rush in at the same moment and just warm the guy

857
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:37.400
that's a good idea on paper and get 10 people together.
Hey,
who's with me?

858
00:51:37.401 --> 00:51:39.260
We got attacked.
This guy picked you.
Come back to me.
I'm just telling you,

859
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.900
I'm not going to go near that guy.
He's going to stab me.
He still got to stab us.

860
00:51:41.901 --> 00:51:44.200
We all go together,
but he's comes running after it.
I'll,

861
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:47.720
I'll tell you where the rules have changed or people's intuitions of change.

862
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:52.610
It's at 30,000 feet on an airplane.
That's true.
And we haven't really,

863
00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:56.360
we haven't decided this.
It hasn't,
it hasn't come about from the top.

864
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:57.440
This has come about organically,

865
00:51:57.441 --> 00:52:00.890
but I think we all have the sense that if something starts going down on an

866
00:52:00.891 --> 00:52:01.724
airplane,

867
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:07.040
we're all going to rush the guy and this just going to be no hesitation because

868
00:52:07.041 --> 00:52:11.210
we know how bad that can turn out.
Um,

869
00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.590
and that is a,
uh,

870
00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:18.650
I think that attitude could be brought down to ground level.

871
00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.200
And so when you're talking about,
and you know,

872
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:23.300
an active shooter situation in a movie theater,
uh,

873
00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:27.830
the fact that everyone has just run,
everyone's running away from the guy,
uh,

874
00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.120
and,
uh,

875
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:35.170
it's just that he basically has as much time as he wants to just pick targets

876
00:52:35.601 --> 00:52:36.530
and reload.

877
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:41.820
That is what makes it a circumstance of just a massacre.

878
00:52:41.821 --> 00:52:46.820
But in principle,
if everyone rush the guy,

879
00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.360
it was some people would get shot,
but it's,
you're,

880
00:52:49.361 --> 00:52:53.500
you're not talking about a half hour with a guy stalking the halls,
uh,

881
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:54.620
assassinating people here.

882
00:52:54.621 --> 00:52:59.621
You're talking about someone who got off a few shots and then was covered with

883
00:52:59.961 --> 00:53:04.340
bodies.
Uh,
so yeah,
you always wonder,
you know,

884
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:06.650
what you would do in that scenario.
Everybody has,

885
00:53:06.651 --> 00:53:09.530
and be loosened broiler and helping them.
To me,
if I see that shit,

886
00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:14.360
I'm going off of that dude.
But real conflict,
I've seen it many,

887
00:53:14.361 --> 00:53:19.040
many times.
You know,
I've seen thousands of guys get beat up,
like real up close.

888
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:22.040
You're going and you're talking about in compensation.
Yeah,
yeah.

889
00:53:22.041 --> 00:53:26.040
And competition and it's,
um,
conflict is fucking

890
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.750
<v 1>terrifying for people.
You know,</v>

891
00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:29.880
I've seen plenty of people get beat up on the street too,

892
00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:35.600
but there's something about the potential for things to happen badly to you that

893
00:53:36.301 --> 00:53:37.860
are absolutely horrifying for people.

894
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:40.240
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's,
it's not that it's,</v>

895
00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:44.470
it is rational to be the first person to run away.
It's not,

896
00:53:44.471 --> 00:53:48.790
it's not that that's bad advice for the person.
Um,

897
00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:54.360
and it's probably advice that we should all take if our only concern is to avoid

898
00:53:55.481 --> 00:53:58.160
violence wherever it appears.
And that's,
you know,
and,

899
00:53:58.161 --> 00:54:02.200
and there are situations where you're going to want to do that no matter who you

900
00:54:02.201 --> 00:54:05.860
are.
So if you're,
if you're out in public with your,
your six year old daughter,

901
00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:10.780
um,
that's probably not the moment for you to try to be a hero.

902
00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:13.720
That's the moment for you to get the hell out of there as quickly as possible.

903
00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:18.400
Uh,
and that's,
that may be true.
Even if you're a cop,
you know,
you,
you,

904
00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:22.510
you have to rank,
order your priorities and do it very quickly.
But,

905
00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:25.660
um,
I just think that there is,

906
00:54:26.110 --> 00:54:30.490
there's an ethic that we could have much more of in the society they could,

907
00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:32.810
could be tuned up by,
I mean,

908
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:36.550
it would certainly be tuned up by martial arts training in,
in many more people,

909
00:54:36.551 --> 00:54:41.480
but it could just be tuned up even without the training that,
uh,

910
00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:46.740
things are a lot worse when you give the bad guy amaryllis freedom to move.

911
00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:50.110
Uh,
and,
and there are very few bad guys,

912
00:54:50.111 --> 00:54:54.530
even armed bad guys who can deal with a crowd.
Uh,
and,

913
00:54:54.531 --> 00:54:57.640
and so when these things go down in public and you have a natural crowd,

914
00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:01.900
if everyone's just running away or clinging to the exits,
um,
it's,

915
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:05.510
it's very different than if,
if we all,
um,
took,
uh,

916
00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:08.950
the responsibility of being the first to take them down.

917
00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:12.530
<v 1>I think that martial arts should be taught in school the same way we teach</v>

918
00:55:12.531 --> 00:55:15.050
writing.
The same way we teach math.
I really do.

919
00:55:15.051 --> 00:55:18.770
I think if you wanted to avoid bullies,
void people become bullies,

920
00:55:18.771 --> 00:55:20.960
teach people how to fight,
cause people to compete,

921
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:25.400
all that bully stuff will go away.
Bolinas is mostly born out of insecurity,

922
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:30.410
mostly born out of insecurity and born out of this desire that animals have.

923
00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:33.350
Um,
you know,
to assert their dominance.
You know,

924
00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:36.680
and you see in the animal world you see a constantly and people,

925
00:55:36.681 --> 00:55:41.681
it's almost like a natural reaction to try to gain some security by making

926
00:55:41.721 --> 00:55:42.620
others feel weak.

927
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:47.830
It's a terrible answer to this conundrum of,
you know,
of,

928
00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:51.440
of insecurity.
I think a far better one is not being unsecure.

929
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:55.340
Learning that the actual martial arts techniques and learning what your

930
00:55:55.341 --> 00:55:59.030
character is all about,
learning how to do something that's really difficult.

931
00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:02.840
Learning how to push your body when you want to quit learning how to escape a

932
00:56:02.841 --> 00:56:04.370
situation that looked hopeless.

933
00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:07.360
Those things are regular lessons in a martial arts class.
Yeah.

934
00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:10.820
I can't tell you how many times I've almost tapped and then gotten out of

935
00:56:10.821 --> 00:56:14.450
something and you're like,
Woo.
And then you learn,
you learn how to not tap.

936
00:56:14.451 --> 00:56:17.150
You learn how to get,
you know,
and tap when you have to.
Don't get injured,

937
00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:21.160
but you learn how to keep calm and not freak out.
Whereas,
um,

938
00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:25.050
I've been in class before with new guys and it's really,
it doesn't,
I don't,

939
00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:28.270
it doesn't happen very often.
I'm really broke with white belts very often,

940
00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:31.210
but I would roll with them and he would feel him panicking.

941
00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:33.550
You'd feel them go into full panic attack.

942
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:37.090
You could feel them like hyperventilating,
you know,
and I'm always,

943
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:40.150
I'm the guy who's always like,
just chill out.
Relax dude,

944
00:56:40.151 --> 00:56:42.280
this is what you need to do.
And I'll try to talk him through it.

945
00:56:42.281 --> 00:56:45.250
But it's a weird thing to see this,

946
00:56:45.251 --> 00:56:49.780
this natural animal reaction simply because the person is not trained.

947
00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:53.650
Or I'll be in that same position with a guy who's like a blue belt or something

948
00:56:53.651 --> 00:56:56.470
like that and they just stay calm.
They know how to do it.
They've been there,

949
00:56:56.471 --> 00:56:59.110
done that.
They know how to do it and they might get tapped still,

950
00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:01.520
but at least they're gonna do what they have to do to,

951
00:57:01.550 --> 00:57:04.030
to try their best to get out of that situation.

952
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:08.470
I think that martial arts for men especially,
and I think for women too,

953
00:57:08.471 --> 00:57:09.770
I shouldn't even say men,
especially a,

954
00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:12.070
and obviously don't know what it's like to be a woman.

955
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:15.490
But I think for men it's a critical part of developing your personality,

956
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.550
not because you should be fighting people,
not because you should be,

957
00:57:18.551 --> 00:57:22.390
I think people need to do difficult things to explore their character.

958
00:57:22.391 --> 00:57:24.550
I think it's important for human beings.

959
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:26.650
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah.
No,
I completely agree.</v>

960
00:57:26.651 --> 00:57:31.651
I think we'd want to distinguish between or among the martial arts because I

961
00:57:32.031 --> 00:57:33.150
think there are martial arts that,

962
00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:38.820
that tune up the wrong part of the ego because you're actually not ever having

963
00:57:41.021 --> 00:57:44.800
your skills confirmed or disconfirmed cause it's all in the,
in this,

964
00:57:44.801 --> 00:57:48.820
in this domain of fantasy and pantomimes of violence.

965
00:57:48.821 --> 00:57:52.740
And um,
just very quiet.
Just this,
we have this,

966
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:56.050
this cooperative exchange of attacks and,

967
00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:59.740
and replies to the attacks where you're not actually fighting,
right?

968
00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:02.110
You're not actually poking the person in the eye and seeing what's,

969
00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:04.690
what happens or getting poked in the eye sight.
So these,

970
00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:09.220
this sort of the cut between,
uh,
you know,

971
00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:13.960
what are either either the fantasy based martial arts or the or the,
uh,

972
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:17.080
so-called,
um,
realistic,
you know,
self defense,

973
00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:21.130
martial arts and something like Brazilian Jujitsu where where you're really,

974
00:58:21.131 --> 00:58:26.050
you're,
you're pressure testing it 100%.
Uh,
now I think,
I think there,
there are,

975
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:30.880
uh,
pathologies to the sport pressure testing as well.

976
00:58:30.881 --> 00:58:34.250
I think you have to have a,
to get a very clear view of what,

977
00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:36.310
what works in the world.
You have to be a,

978
00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.470
an intelligent consumer of all these things.

979
00:58:38.471 --> 00:58:42.640
But there is something toxic about training in a,

980
00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:47.940
an art where you're always left wondering whether it works.

981
00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:49.840
Yes.
You know,
and,
and,

982
00:58:49.841 --> 00:58:54.841
and especially as a teenage male if the feeling that you might have something to

983
00:58:55.001 --> 00:58:56.780
prove and the fear of,

984
00:58:56.781 --> 00:59:00.040
of being someone who couldn't actually prove it.

985
00:59:00.041 --> 00:59:04.340
And that whole paranoia that happens in a school where you have teachers who,

986
00:59:04.341 --> 00:59:08.090
who skills are by definition never tested it.
Like the black belt.

987
00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:12.550
A sensei never is going to roll with his students in these arts.
I mean,

988
00:59:12.551 --> 00:59:17.150
all he's doing is walking around teaching his fantasy techniques,
uh,
and you,

989
00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:20.420
you need,
you'd never,
I,
the students wouldn't be comfortable,
you know,

990
00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:24.310
wrestling him the ground and it's,
you know,
sweating,
tapping him out.
It was just,

991
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:29.360
you know,
you have this,
this hierarchy that is never,
um,
uh,

992
00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:33.080
it,
it's,
it's,
you just imagine that the guys got mad skills,
but it's,

993
00:59:33.081 --> 00:59:36.740
they're never,
they're never demonstrated in a way that is,
other than,
you know,

994
00:59:36.741 --> 00:59:38.930
yeah.
Maybe he can do some very pretty kicks,

995
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:41.480
but he's not actually fighting anyone.

996
00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:44.540
<v 1>It's very cold.
Like when I was doing taekwondo,
when I was a kid,</v>

997
00:59:44.541 --> 00:59:47.860
it was very cold.
Like,
I mean,
there was,
uh,
we,

998
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:51.110
we showed that it was effective against taekwondo and training,

999
00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.780
but they didn't take advantage of the call.

1000
00:59:53.781 --> 00:59:56.180
It was a very good school and it was just about discipline.

1001
00:59:56.181 --> 00:59:59.840
And for me it was hugely important to have that discipline as a young man,

1002
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:03.710
the bowing and all that stuff.
There's rules that you just don't cross.
Like,

1003
01:00:03.711 --> 01:00:07.790
I remember when I was,
um,
when I was 15,
I had a crazy girlfriend and uh,

1004
01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.830
she used to want to choose to want to do it all the time.

1005
01:00:09.831 --> 01:00:12.930
She was crazy and she wants to do it at the school cause I was teaching at the

1006
01:00:12.931 --> 01:00:16.250
time.
I used to have the keys to the school and I wouldn't,
I wouldn't let her,

1007
01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.960
I mean that's the only time ever,

1008
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:20.930
the only rule that could have prevented you from doing that,

1009
01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:25.490
especially as a horny 15,
16 year old,
whatever it was.
That's ridiculous.
You know?

1010
01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:25.791
I mean,

1011
01:00:25.791 --> 01:00:30.680
I had a lock keyed what building and no one was there and we could just bang it

1012
01:00:30.681 --> 01:00:33.740
out.
No problem.
There's couches.
There was no problems.
I was like,
nope,

1013
01:00:33.741 --> 01:00:35.150
we can't do it here.
You know?

1014
01:00:35.151 --> 01:00:38.870
And I'd never had any discipline whatsoever as a young man.

1015
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.760
But I remember when I started learning it,
taekwondo,
it was like very limited.

1016
01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:48.650
There was a lot of holes in it as a style,
especially when it comes to punching.

1017
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:50.570
Like taekwondo is all about kicking.

1018
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:53.590
There's benefits to that because he learned like really incredible leg dexterity

1019
01:00:53.591 --> 01:00:54.770
in some of the best kickers ever.

1020
01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.770
Our taekwondo guys who eventually learned Moyie Thai kickboxing,

1021
01:00:57.771 --> 01:01:00.750
boxing and wrestling,
right?
There's a lot of guys in the UFC now that,

1022
01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.140
that are super effective with those techniques.

1023
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:07.970
But when you start training with kickbox is you just get beat up.

1024
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.980
It's a really humbling revelation.
I realized,
Oh fuck,

1025
01:01:12.981 --> 01:01:15.590
you know,
I've been wasting time.
Like I'm doing something.

1026
01:01:15.591 --> 01:01:17.420
Like I had to revamp my whole style.

1027
01:01:17.421 --> 01:01:20.570
I completed that and then I started kickboxing and then I thought,

1028
01:01:20.571 --> 01:01:22.970
well at least I've got,
you know,
that whole patched up.

1029
01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:27.971
And then I went to Jujitsu class and I got fucking mangled and I was like,

1030
01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.670
oh no,
I'm helpless.
I was like,

1031
01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:34.040
at least I thought like in a street fight with striking,

1032
01:01:34.041 --> 01:01:36.770
even if I wasn't like the best kicker,
a puncher that,

1033
01:01:36.771 --> 01:01:39.500
so I would be able to keep some the off of me.
But I,

1034
01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.860
there's this kid that was a purple belt,

1035
01:01:41.861 --> 01:01:45.830
this Brazilian kid who's just just raped me.
He was just run through me,

1036
01:01:45.831 --> 01:01:47.480
just smash me every time we train.

1037
01:01:47.481 --> 01:01:50.120
I had never had a chance and he wasn't trying to let me survive.

1038
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:53.900
He was getting great delight.
He was about my age,
great delight,

1039
01:01:53.901 --> 01:01:57.380
and strangle the shit out of me,
and it was a very important,

1040
01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:01.970
because I could quit,
I could quit.
Then I could've said,
you know what?
Fuck this.

1041
01:02:01.971 --> 01:02:04.760
I'll just go to a kickboxing Jenny Moore.
I'm proficient and I look good.

1042
01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:06.980
I'm not doing this where I just get humiliated.

1043
01:02:06.981 --> 01:02:08.510
Anybody's watching and I look like a bitch,

1044
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.960
but I decided I want to do what he's doing.
I want to be able to do that.

1045
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.940
That's incredible.
This guy just manhandled me.

1046
01:02:13.941 --> 01:02:16.910
Wear the same size and you can do anything he wants to make.
It tapped me.

1047
01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:17.930
He was mounting me.

1048
01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:21.240
Armbar me triangling mean it was just running through drills on me.
I was like,

1049
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:22.380
this is ridiculous.

1050
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:26.230
<v 0>Yeah.
It's such an astonishing epiphany as a,
I mean,</v>

1051
01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:28.230
it's probably true for anyone,

1052
01:02:28.231 --> 01:02:31.700
but it's especially true if you've come from a background in martial arts where

1053
01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:36.130
you think you have some skills.
Did you?
Yeah,
yeah.
What was your background?
So I,

1054
01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.820
I studied with a guy,
um,
uh,

1055
01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:41.550
as a teenager through maybe a,

1056
01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:44.730
I think I stopped when I was 22 and this is a guy whose,

1057
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:49.170
whose background I never totally believed.
I mean as he's like,

1058
01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:54.280
he had real skills and he taught something that was a very analogous to Krav

1059
01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.480
Maga or somebody said it's like a street oriented self defense where you're

1060
01:03:00.481 --> 01:03:02.370
learning,
you're basically taking the boxing,

1061
01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.640
the striking from boxing and the kicking from Muay Thai and a just a Smidgen of

1062
01:03:08.521 --> 01:03:11.670
grappling.
But I basically did not know how to grapple,
but I,

1063
01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.350
I felt like I knew a lot about how to defend myself.
Right.
Uh,

1064
01:03:16.351 --> 01:03:19.730
but I hadn't done martial arts for 20 years and I get back into it,
uh,

1065
01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:24.890
and start doing Brazilian Jujitsu and got on the mat with Chris Hauder and it

1066
01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:29.730
was like,
it was like wrestling with a Martian.
I mean it was just,

1067
01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:33.180
it was just like that the rules of physics did not apply to him.
And He's,

1068
01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:35.580
he's my son.
He's probably 10 pounds lighter than me.
He's,
he's,

1069
01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:39.220
and maybe an inch shorter.
And,
um,

1070
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:44.280
it was just this most surreal experience of being,

1071
01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:49.550
of making a hundred percent effort to survive and failing every 30 seconds or a

1072
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:51.930
minute and a half.

1073
01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:55.860
And just then being resurrected by just the sheer fact that he decided not to

1074
01:03:55.861 --> 01:03:59.250
kill me.
And,
and then doing it again and just gat and it,

1075
01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:04.260
there's nothing like gassing under that kind of pressure when you have no idea,

1076
01:04:04.321 --> 01:04:07.950
you have no idea what to do and you have no idea to relax.
It's like this,

1077
01:04:07.951 --> 01:04:10.530
like you can't,
it's,
you can't.
So awesome.
Yeah.

1078
01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:12.970
<v 1>And Chris Helder is old school Machado.
Black belt.</v>

1079
01:04:12.971 --> 01:04:16.210
He's been around for a long time.
Yeah,
he's a,
I think he was wanting to,

1080
01:04:16.211 --> 01:04:18.670
John Chalk or Hagens,
I don't know who is under his,

1081
01:04:18.671 --> 01:04:21.940
the only Gagan he get a gun when he gets first black boats.
He's,
yeah,

1082
01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:22.774
he's got some skills.

1083
01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:27.110
<v 0>He's one of the,
I think they,
I think they're called the dirty dozen,</v>

1084
01:04:27.111 --> 01:04:30.170
I think the first 12 American black belts.
And he's one of the,

1085
01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.280
he's one of the first

1086
01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:36.360
<v 1>as one of the,
uh,
without a doubt,
one of the greatest compliments my life.
Yeah.</v>

1087
01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:39.790
When I got my five belt there was snowed out.
Yeah.
That's awesome.
It's like,
wow,

1088
01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:43.330
whoa.
And is it hard to believe,
you know,
it's like,
whoa.
You know,
when,

1089
01:04:43.331 --> 01:04:45.880
when I can do that to people,
that's the weirdest thing ever.

1090
01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:48.040
And when I can do what that purple belt did mean,
I don't do it.

1091
01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:52.030
I'm not mean like that,
but the,
when I can just,
just play with somebody.

1092
01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:55.630
It's so funny.
It's so strange.
It's like,
and then people can play with me.

1093
01:04:55.631 --> 01:04:59.350
Like if I roll the Jake shields or Marcella Garcia or Eddie Bravo,
they just,

1094
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:02.650
mommy,
I mean,
this is,
I'm doing this survive.
And if I wrote with Eddie Bravo,

1095
01:05:02.651 --> 01:05:06.370
it's just survival.
John Jack,
same thing.
Survival.
Trying to survive,

1096
01:05:06.371 --> 01:05:10.030
trying to hang on survival,
try to use defense.
And John Jack goes easy on you.

1097
01:05:10.690 --> 01:05:13.020
He's like,
my man,
look out for your mom.
You know,
he,

1098
01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:17.540
he jokes around with you as he's rolling with you.
Right.
But,
um,
the,
uh,
the,

1099
01:05:17.541 --> 01:05:21.850
the technical aspect of Jujitsu is very overlooked to people who don't

1100
01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:24.390
participant in it because it's weird when you looking at it,

1101
01:05:24.391 --> 01:05:27.520
it's just a bunch of guys swimming around in the ground like they don't

1102
01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:31.360
understand it.
I remember watching the original UFC,

1103
01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:33.760
he's before I started Jujitsu,
look like,
what is he doing?

1104
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.220
I got understand what he's doing.
I didn't understand the movement.

1105
01:05:36.221 --> 01:05:40.450
So I was seeing was the end right where I take great pride in when I do

1106
01:05:40.451 --> 01:05:43.810
commentary explaining the various steps that the guy has to do.

1107
01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:46.960
Like this is what he's got to do and this is what he's got to avoid.

1108
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:48.580
Like there's two things going on right now.

1109
01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:51.910
There's a battle of position and I've had so many people come up to me that said

1110
01:05:51.911 --> 01:05:54.820
they started Jujitsu based on listening to the commentary.
They're like,

1111
01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:57.580
I gotta learn this.
This is so cool.
It's so weird.

1112
01:05:58.030 --> 01:06:02.320
And it's one of the few martial arts where the little man really can defeat the

1113
01:06:02.321 --> 01:06:05.740
bigger,
stronger man easily.
And there's a lot of that,

1114
01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:09.100
that fantasy martial arts that you were talking about where there's people that

1115
01:06:09.101 --> 01:06:11.500
have the deaf touch and they can,
you know what I mean?

1116
01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.960
You've seen those videos online where guys throw their hand and people and they

1117
01:06:13.961 --> 01:06:16.540
fall to the ground and you've got an a wonder what's going on,

1118
01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:19.480
whether the person's helping out and they're falling to the ground on purpose or

1119
01:06:19.481 --> 01:06:22.180
whether they really believe they get zapped with some cheap.

1120
01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:26.530
But when you see a guy like hoists Gracie defeat a guy like Ken shamrock or

1121
01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:30.540
defeat a guy like,
um,
like the old school Dan Severen.
Yeah.

1122
01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:34.060
When you called him in that triangle off his back,
he taps him.
I mean madness.

1123
01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:38.140
Like how does this happen?
How is this possible?
This guy's 250 fucking pounds.

1124
01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:41.980
The other guys,
one 70,
soaking wet bill like a popsicle stick.
And he just,

1125
01:06:41.981 --> 01:06:46.360
he just tapped that guy.
He gave up.
Yeah.
It's so technical,
you know?

1126
01:06:46.361 --> 01:06:47.490
And so it's really the,

1127
01:06:47.491 --> 01:06:51.940
the one martial art that actually has that whole Bruce Lee thing going on where

1128
01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:56.530
the one small guy can defeat the large guy.
It's all,
it's also the one art where

1129
01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.850
<v 0>it has what a Kido claims it has.</v>

1130
01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:04.710
It really is it at least potentially the peaceful art?
Yeah,

1131
01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:08.700
you can,
it's just a negotiation.
I mean you,
you control someone's position,

1132
01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:13.710
you control someone's ability to harm you and then you can just start talking

1133
01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:18.760
like how far do you want to take this?
Exactly.
And,
and it's,
uh,
Eh,

1134
01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:21.840
in principle all grappling is that,
and all,
you know,

1135
01:07:21.841 --> 01:07:25.320
joint locks added to grappling I guess,
uh,
is that,

1136
01:07:25.321 --> 01:07:29.030
but Brazilian Jujitsu is,
I think the,
uh,

1137
01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:33.990
if you're just going to take the off the shelf solution to that suite of

1138
01:07:33.991 --> 01:07:38.520
problems where you've got two people trying to dominate one another physically

1139
01:07:38.521 --> 01:07:43.521
and you want to do it in a way where the violence is truly incremental,

1140
01:07:44.010 --> 01:07:47.770
where you do,
you can just,
you can turn it up as slowly as,
as the,

1141
01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:52.200
the laws of physics allow,
uh,
Brazilian Jujitsu is,
is that,

1142
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:56.850
and whereas a striking based solution is not that mean you don't know what's

1143
01:07:56.851 --> 01:07:58.960
going to happen when you punch someone in the face.
You,
you,
you,

1144
01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:00.840
you may break your hand,
you may knock them out.

1145
01:08:00.841 --> 01:08:03.870
You may knock them out and have them hit their head on the curb and die.

1146
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:08.280
There's a lot,
there's a lot you can't control for and you,
and you can't,
I mean,

1147
01:08:08.281 --> 01:08:12.750
you can't apply a punch incrementally,
uh,
to,
to solve the problem.

1148
01:08:12.751 --> 01:08:16.250
And so it's,
um,
and they can hit you too.
Yeah.
When you're grappling

1149
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:19.580
<v 1>with a guy.
If,
if I get a guy down in my,
mount them and he's a white belt,</v>

1150
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.890
he's not choking me.
Right?
It's not gonna happen.
Right.

1151
01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.230
But if you're swinging with some guy out in the parking lot,

1152
01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:25.530
you could easily get knocked.
Oh yeah.

1153
01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:29.600
I've seen fights in the UFC where a high level striker gets KOD by a guy who has

1154
01:08:29.601 --> 01:08:32.840
no business in the ring with them.
It just happens.
You guys swings a punch.

1155
01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:34.330
He connects on the draw and that's a wrap.
Yeah,

1156
01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.220
there's not a lot of luck and grappling.
Zero,
zero luck.

1157
01:08:37.221 --> 01:08:39.020
And that's what's amazing about it.
It's,
I mean,

1158
01:08:39.021 --> 01:08:43.720
no one ever says he got a lucky triangle.
He can't get a lucky tree.

1159
01:08:43.721 --> 01:08:46.310
That's a fucking complex move to set up.
You have to cut angles,

1160
01:08:46.311 --> 01:08:48.740
you have to secure it.
You have to make sure it's not over the foot.

1161
01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:52.280
It's over the ankle.
There's a lot of lot of variables involved.
You're a,

1162
01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:56.450
you were talking about your instructor not quite believing in him.

1163
01:08:56.630 --> 01:09:00.350
Eddie Bravo has a great story of a guy that he was training under before he

1164
01:09:00.351 --> 01:09:05.030
found Jujitsu that was doing one of those sort of multiple art bait systems.

1165
01:09:05.031 --> 01:09:05.601
He had like,
you know,

1166
01:09:05.601 --> 01:09:10.580
five black belts and different arts and he told everyone he was going to China

1167
01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:12.020
to train.
You know,

1168
01:09:12.021 --> 01:09:15.350
he had a great master in China that he was going to train and uh,

1169
01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:18.260
Eddie went to the supermarket and you recognize the guy's car.

1170
01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:21.440
And so he goes inside and the guy was shopping.

1171
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:23.210
He was pretending he was in China.

1172
01:09:23.211 --> 01:09:26.270
He just took the week off and was just hanging out and shopping.

1173
01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:29.720
Who's going to come back and tell everybody went to China and learn some cheap

1174
01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:30.573
gone.

1175
01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:35.630
Have you seen those videos online where they have those old masters to think

1176
01:09:35.631 --> 01:09:36.550
that they can actually fight?

1177
01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.480
<v 0>Yeah,
no,
I have,
I posted a bunch of those on my youtube page.</v>

1178
01:09:39.481 --> 01:09:42.630
There's so sad there.
Well,
there the sad one.

1179
01:09:42.631 --> 01:09:46.560
What were the guy offers the challenge and then gets punched in the nose by the,

1180
01:09:46.670 --> 01:09:50.970
this very ordinary looking martial artists,
um,
that,
that one's sad,
but the,
the,

1181
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:55.510
the,
I mean they just mesmerizing to watch the ones where there is no dis

1182
01:09:55.530 --> 01:09:59.240
confirmation.
There's just the,
just the cult in full.
Yeah.
Uh,

1183
01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:04.230
splendor and you just have everyone complying with this magic touch.

1184
01:10:04.231 --> 01:10:06.690
I mean,
even at distances of 20 feet,
you got people,
you know,

1185
01:10:06.691 --> 01:10:10.230
writhing in pain and flopping around.
Uh,
and I don't,

1186
01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:11.850
I don't know what explains it.

1187
01:10:11.851 --> 01:10:16.851
I don't think it is conscious fraud on the part of most of these people.

1188
01:10:16.861 --> 01:10:20.460
I think there's a,
there's a kind of induction is that there's a sort of,

1189
01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:25.050
there's a hypnotic component to it and a sort of a suggestibility but,

1190
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:28.200
and also social pressure and self deception and,

1191
01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:30.300
and just many things get,

1192
01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:35.420
get a conspired to make people participate in this thing that is seemingly the

1193
01:10:38.011 --> 01:10:39.900
most delusional thing that has ever happened.

1194
01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:42.300
Explained to people who have no idea what we're talking about.
Okay.

1195
01:10:42.301 --> 01:10:46.020
So that you can actually,
um,
uh,
a good place to see it.

1196
01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:49.410
We have a video po yeah.
On,
on,
um,
on my,
uh,

1197
01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:52.340
if you go to my youtube page,
there's a,

1198
01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:56.480
there's a fake martial art stream,
uh,
and uh,

1199
01:10:56.850 --> 01:11:01.410
Sam Harris or,
or gee is my,
is my youtube page,
but there's,
um,

1200
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:03.690
and also I wrote a blog post,
the,
um,

1201
01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:07.170
the pleasures of drowning where I talked about a Brazilian Jujitsu.

1202
01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:10.110
And in that blog post,
I think it's an Epilogue,

1203
01:11:10.410 --> 01:11:14.430
I'm pretty sure isn't that blog post I linked to one of these videos.
Um,

1204
01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:19.460
uh,
the,
um,
like he bills himself as some,
a kito master.
I,
okay.

1205
01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:21.480
I can't imagine he's actually an Aikido guy,

1206
01:11:21.481 --> 01:11:26.430
but this is the guy who is causing people to fly all over the room at a distance

1207
01:11:26.431 --> 01:11:28.560
of 20 feet.
And then he issues this challenge.

1208
01:11:28.561 --> 01:11:31.890
And I think it was a $5,000 challenge to any martial artists who had the courage

1209
01:11:31.891 --> 01:11:36.790
to test his powers.
And you see the challenge match where,
um,
on,
no,

1210
01:11:36.791 --> 01:11:41.040
this is,
um,
these guys are also awesome.
These guys are amazing.
Yeah.

1211
01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.870
It just throws him off.
So,
uh,
there,
there are many,
there's so many,

1212
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:47.720
there's so many videos out there that are,

1213
01:11:47.721 --> 01:11:52.020
are just priceless and they should be impossible.
I mean,
this is really,

1214
01:11:52.021 --> 01:11:53.550
this is not because this is just,

1215
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:58.470
it has all the features of religion except the thing that,
that's the guy.

1216
01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:03.060
Oh yeah.
Cause yeah,
he's the guy who's got a,
so you see his skills.
This is,

1217
01:12:03.061 --> 01:12:06.620
this is where his has skills work.
Um,

1218
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:09.930
but then you see a challenge match.
And uh,
he,

1219
01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:14.190
he clearly did not know that he couldn't do this because otherwise he would

1220
01:12:14.191 --> 01:12:15.480
never would have issued that challenge.

1221
01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:18.390
But he really believes that this is working.
This is working.

1222
01:12:18.391 --> 01:12:22.770
But you can imagine what if you opened a school and for the next 30 years,

1223
01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:25.440
everyone cooperates with you.
You know,

1224
01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:29.520
so you've never met someone who wouldn't fall down a w two,

1225
01:12:29.521 --> 01:12:33.240
your magic touch.
I,
you could see how he would believe this.

1226
01:12:33.241 --> 01:12:36.990
And he's basically run a psychological experiment on himself and brainwashed

1227
01:12:36.991 --> 01:12:41.970
himself in the presence of all of these compliance students.
Um,
but anyways,

1228
01:12:41.971 --> 01:12:45.450
challenge matches is,
um,
somewhat depressing,

1229
01:12:45.451 --> 01:12:50.451
but also it's also pretty satisfying to see a mass delusion disconfirmed that

1230
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.370
emphatically,
I mean that this is what you want to see go down with religion.

1231
01:12:56.730 --> 01:13:00.690
The problem is the,
the religion really is tennis without a net.

1232
01:13:00.691 --> 01:13:02.220
I mean there's just,
there is no,

1233
01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:07.020
there's no discount formation that is so clear that the religious person is

1234
01:13:07.021 --> 01:13:10.890
going to accept it.
Whereas this guy getting repeatedly punched in the face,

1235
01:13:10.891 --> 01:13:12.960
he has to accept that he's lost the fight.

1236
01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:17.150
I'm a one imagines maybe he still has a school somewhere,
but um,
it's just,

1237
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:21.720
it's clear that his,
his martial art doesn't work well.

1238
01:13:21.721 --> 01:13:26.000
He gets so confused when he gets hit.
You could see the look on his face,
see,

1239
01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:30.840
play it through the part where you get the beat up.
He gets so confused.

1240
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:35.330
Pull it like it's way ahead.
Where he's a,
there's a,
looks like a,
a Keel,

1241
01:13:35.331 --> 01:13:38.460
Kachin guy who's wearing a pair of shorts.
Yeah.
This is the guy.

1242
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:44.250
Some sort of mean.
Just imagine if he got in there with,
with the Anderson Silva.

1243
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:47.430
Anderson Silva is someone who really wanted to prove a point.
I mean,

1244
01:13:47.431 --> 01:13:50.060
the guy he is with hears is just Joe,

1245
01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:54.840
Joe Karate guy,
skilled though the,
when he did a really smart thing,

1246
01:13:54.841 --> 01:13:55.920
he grabbed his gay,

1247
01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:59.190
he grabbed his ski and just started wailing on him in the face.

1248
01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:00.420
He punched him three or four times.

1249
01:14:00.421 --> 01:14:04.110
Then he kicked him in the face and he's an old man.
But,
but also you see the,

1250
01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:07.400
in the other video you see that this guy really doesn't want to hurt him.
He's,

1251
01:14:07.410 --> 01:14:10.170
he's worried about hurting him.
And so after the first blow land,

1252
01:14:10.171 --> 01:14:13.060
that's it right there.
That's,
that's post first blow.
Right before that,

1253
01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.640
he hits him for the first time and he stops right there.

1254
01:14:15.641 --> 01:14:17.020
There's another angle on this.

1255
01:14:17.021 --> 01:14:20.590
There's a video shot from the other side where you can see,
um,

1256
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:25.630
kick while he's holding onto his arm.
Yeah.
We can't even move.

1257
01:14:25.631 --> 01:14:30.490
He just holds them in there and punch him in the face.
Yeah.
But it's,
it's a,

1258
01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:34.040
it's amazing.
I mean,
this is,
this is the,
uh,

1259
01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:39.600
the perfect look I the perfect window at what the human mind is capable of.

1260
01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:40.470
So,

1261
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:45.470
so if the fact that human minds can do this proves that religion can be every

1262
01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:50.920
bit as delusional as atheists say,
it is a,
or at least the,
the,
the,

1263
01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:55.480
the doctrines about the afterlife and,
you know,
all the garish stuff that,
that,

1264
01:14:55.481 --> 01:14:58.750
uh,
we think of in terms of religion,
it can,
it's,

1265
01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:03.370
it's so much easier to deceive yourself about that than it is to deceive

1266
01:15:03.371 --> 01:15:07.690
yourself.
That you can knock,
you know,
20 opponents down with your magic touch.

1267
01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:10.480
And yet this is possible when you have a mechanism,

1268
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:12.700
what's going on there is you're a neuroscientist.

1269
01:15:12.701 --> 01:15:16.710
Tell me what's happening in a person's mind that allows them to just accept like

1270
01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:20.950
hypnotism.
That's real,
right?
It is real.
I,
you know,
[inaudible] there's,

1271
01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:25.510
there's a frontier between what's real and what,
uh,

1272
01:15:26.410 --> 01:15:28.570
and just,
just what I,
you know,
I don't know.

1273
01:15:28.571 --> 01:15:33.571
I don't know where fraud starts and genuine demonstrations of hypnosis and,

1274
01:15:33.741 --> 01:15:38.290
and,
and so,
um,
but clearly some people,

1275
01:15:38.291 --> 01:15:41.980
and there's a spectrum of,
of suggestibility.
Some people are not hypnotizable.

1276
01:15:41.981 --> 01:15:46.060
It's not sounding like everyone can,
can be,
um,
you know,

1277
01:15:46.061 --> 01:15:48.970
the Manchurian candidate.
But,
uh,
there's,

1278
01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:54.250
there clearly it's clearly a phenomenon where you can be given a,

1279
01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:55.840
uh,
a,

1280
01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:59.800
you can be inducted into a state where you're given suggestions,

1281
01:15:59.801 --> 01:16:04.801
which then are operative at the level of your behavior and emotion and,

1282
01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:09.390
um,
and about what you may have no recollection.
Uh,

1283
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:12.120
so I think hypnosis is,
is,
is real.
Um,

1284
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:15.940
and it's a,
uh,
there's also,

1285
01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:20.220
there's other features to this.
So there's the social pressure.
I mean,

1286
01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:22.340
so it just meant,
and then just the sunk cost.
I mean,

1287
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:27.280
imagine devoting years of your life to something which does not work.

1288
01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.630
Um,
but pays all you have the,
either the,
these,

1289
01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:36.100
the belongingness to the group.
You have all of the,
you know,
all of the,
uh,

1290
01:16:36.130 --> 01:16:38.330
the rituals and,
um,
uh,

1291
01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.530
just the sunk cost of how much time you've spent doing this thing,

1292
01:16:41.531 --> 01:16:45.550
whether it's religion or a fake martial art.
Uh,
the,
the pressure that,

1293
01:16:45.551 --> 01:16:50.551
the emotional pressure not to realize it's bullshit is it can be excruciating.

1294
01:16:52.151 --> 01:16:54.220
And,
and when you meet people,
I mean,
well,
one of the,

1295
01:16:54.490 --> 01:16:56.250
one of my favorite conversations with a,

1296
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.610
a former person to faith that I've ever had was,
um,

1297
01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:05.200
I met someone at dinner who had lost her faith that day.

1298
01:17:05.710 --> 01:17:07.770
Literally,
I got her just fresh,
you know,
that,

1299
01:17:07.771 --> 01:17:12.560
that just adjust when the thought bubble had had burst.
Uh,
she,

1300
01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:17.600
she just showed up at this dinner and the,
her overriding,

1301
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.943
<v 3>uh,</v>

1302
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:22.310
<v 0>feeling was just of,</v>

1303
01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:24.183
<v 3>uh,</v>

1304
01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:27.490
<v 0>depression over how much time she had wasted.</v>

1305
01:17:27.730 --> 01:17:32.620
Just like the sunk cost of it because she had spent decades fixated on this,

1306
01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.390
this stuff,
and it had,

1307
01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.730
it had completely distorted her relationships and him,

1308
01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:38.830
it had been the center of her life.

1309
01:17:38.831 --> 01:17:43.510
And she finally admitted to herself that day that in this case with Catholicism,

1310
01:17:43.511 --> 01:17:44.890
that none of it was true.
You know,

1311
01:17:44.891 --> 01:17:49.650
and this is what she had just been brainwashed.
Uh,
and,
but,
but the,

1312
01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:51.490
the,
the,
the,
the regret,

1313
01:17:51.491 --> 01:17:56.260
the level of regret over the time wasted and all the things she could have done

1314
01:17:56.261 --> 01:18:01.180
with that time and all the,
uh,
it's just,
it's,
it's,
that is a wall that,

1315
01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:03.400
that many people just can't clear because it's,

1316
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:05.750
it's just too painful to acknowledge.
It's very painful.
When,

1317
01:18:05.751 --> 01:18:10.120
what was the mechanism for her?
What was the,
the,
the reason,
uh,
well,

1318
01:18:10.121 --> 01:18:10.601
actually it should be,

1319
01:18:10.601 --> 01:18:15.270
she credited one of my books in that she may be something else that had,

1320
01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:17.530
had helped her along,
but no,

1321
01:18:17.531 --> 01:18:21.610
the last thing she had been reading where she finally realized,
Oh my God,

1322
01:18:21.611 --> 01:18:25.540
I've been deceived about this.
Uh,
it was,
what was one of my books hoodwinked?

1323
01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.370
Was it letters to a Christian nation?
I don't know.

1324
01:18:27.371 --> 01:18:28.540
It was either that or the interface.

1325
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:33.310
Lying is your new book and what it's,
uh,

1326
01:18:34.090 --> 01:18:36.340
there's a really important thing that you,
uh,

1327
01:18:36.370 --> 01:18:39.850
you bring up and it's not on the front part of this.

1328
01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:45.090
I read it online somewhere that you can avoid a lot of problems in your life.

1329
01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.540
Yeah.
Yeah.
Simply by not lying.
Almost almost all of them.

1330
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:53.370
Of all the ones that are avoidable.
Yeah.

1331
01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:58.390
When you just look at how people screw up their lives line is,

1332
01:18:58.790 --> 01:19:00.520
if it's not the reason,

1333
01:19:00.850 --> 01:19:05.740
it's the thing that enabled the other reason it's people complicate their lives

1334
01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:11.140
massively by a willingness to deceive others.

1335
01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:14.560
Uh,
and to,
and this has many features to it.

1336
01:19:14.561 --> 01:19:16.780
One is just there all the things you,

1337
01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:21.990
you can do based on the cover that lies provide that you shouldn't be doing

1338
01:19:25.481 --> 01:19:26.700
because they're not good for you and know,

1339
01:19:26.710 --> 01:19:29.020
and everyone would hate you if they knew you were doing them or your,
you know,

1340
01:19:29.021 --> 01:19:32.890
your wife would leave you or whatever,
whatever it is.
Uh,
and so the law,
the lies,

1341
01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:37.320
lies create a space in which you can let your life run off the whale.
Oh,

1342
01:19:37.321 --> 01:19:41.200
run off the rails,
whether it's becoming an addict or what,
or,
or,
um,

1343
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:46.430
uh,
you know,
perpetrating financial frauds or whatever it is.
Uh,
uh,

1344
01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:50.500
but there's,
there's also this component where you don't actually,

1345
01:19:50.501 --> 01:19:55.501
you never actually discover who you are in social space if you always leave

1346
01:19:56.111 --> 01:19:58.030
yourself this out of line.

1347
01:19:58.031 --> 01:20:01.840
So it's like you never discover that if you keep canceling plans with people and

1348
01:20:01.841 --> 01:20:06.841
just tell this white lie that you're too busy or you're not feeling well or you

1349
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:10.230
never have to confront the fact that these are people you actually don't want to

1350
01:20:10.231 --> 01:20:11.011
see.
You know,

1351
01:20:11.011 --> 01:20:13.590
you don't feel like you've got people in your life who want to go out to dinner

1352
01:20:13.591 --> 01:20:14.400
with you.

1353
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:18.660
You don't want to see them and you're never having to confront that because you

1354
01:20:18.661 --> 01:20:21.500
have this out that you're just going to lie,
you know?
And,

1355
01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:24.870
and it's just if you want,
I mean,

1356
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:31.070
there's actually no change in a person's life that I think is more important in

1357
01:20:31.471 --> 01:20:34.680
terms of getting your life straight,
your,
your relationship to ship straight.

1358
01:20:34.681 --> 01:20:39.390
You're just getting into the future,
uh,
without screwing it up for yourself.

1359
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:42.010
Um,
there's no more important change then,

1360
01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.810
then a commitment to being honest and in,

1361
01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.890
in whatever the situation is that presents itself.

1362
01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:50.430
So you don't fake it till you make it.
That's not good.
Do you ever heard that?

1363
01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:56.040
Well,
no,
you can
not good that I think,

1364
01:20:56.041 --> 01:20:58.350
well you can fake,
you can fake something until you make it,

1365
01:20:58.351 --> 01:21:03.180
which is you can fake confidence,
a positive attitude toward uncertainty.

1366
01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:03.900
I mean you can,
so you can,

1367
01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:08.820
so you can go into a situation without any guarantee that it's going to work out

1368
01:21:08.821 --> 01:21:12.270
or that you're going to develop the skills that you need or that you are going,

1369
01:21:12.271 --> 01:21:16.740
that people are going to like you but have a positive attitude.
Uh,

1370
01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:18.370
and,
and um,

1371
01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:23.130
I mean it's sort of a good will toward the future that you can develop.

1372
01:21:23.131 --> 01:21:27.330
And that is a kind of,
I mean it's,
it's faking confidence and faking comfort.

1373
01:21:27.331 --> 01:21:30.180
Maybe,
but that's not lying.
That's a line is,

1374
01:21:30.570 --> 01:21:34.890
is when you are intent intentionally

1375
01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:41.850
implant planting false beliefs and others when they expect the truth.

1376
01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:45.810
So it's not,
I mean it's so,
so being a card magician or being a poker player,

1377
01:21:45.811 --> 01:21:48.320
I mean this is not,
this is not lying.
That's not decided.
I mean,

1378
01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:53.450
the deception I'm talking about is when someone has every reason to expect the

1379
01:21:53.791 --> 01:21:58.080
truth and you are purporting to give the truth,
but you're not,

1380
01:21:58.230 --> 01:22:02.910
and you're actually deceiving them.
Um,
and,
uh,

1381
01:22:02.911 --> 01:22:04.350
what I focus on in the book,
because it,

1382
01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:08.890
most virtually everyone recognizes that some subset of,

1383
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.320
of deceptions are a problem.
I mean,
the agregious lives that,
you know,

1384
01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:17.040
the frauds that,
that really harm people.
And the lies that,
you know,

1385
01:22:17.041 --> 01:22:20.760
when a pharmaceutical company says the drug works and they're lying,

1386
01:22:21.010 --> 01:22:23.600
everyone recognizes that that's a problem that we've,

1387
01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:27.690
we've all paid a huge price for the,
the,

1388
01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:31.890
the skepticism we now have about governments and corporations because of

1389
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:35.010
whenever we cashed them in a lie,
we just now,
for the next 10 years,

1390
01:22:35.011 --> 01:22:38.940
can't forget that these people in power often lie to us.
Uh,

1391
01:22:38.970 --> 01:22:43.960
but the,
uh,
the line that people,
there's,
there's a,

1392
01:22:43.961 --> 01:22:46.380
there's another set of,
of,

1393
01:22:46.381 --> 01:22:51.240
of lies that people think are actually unavoidable,
you know,
or,
or,

1394
01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:55.370
or good.
Uh,
and this is,
they're usually called white lies.
Um,

1395
01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:58.320
and I think that,

1396
01:22:58.321 --> 01:23:01.980
I think the price we pay for white lies is also excruciating.

1397
01:23:01.981 --> 01:23:05.860
And it's not something that people are quick to see.

1398
01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:09.700
And actually I didn't see it until I went to,
when I was a freshman at Stanford,

1399
01:23:09.701 --> 01:23:13.120
I took a course with a professor who I actually interview in the back of the

1400
01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:16.460
book.
Um,
Ronald Howard,
who is a,
um,

1401
01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:21.610
really a brilliant guy who started a whole academic field called decision

1402
01:23:21.611 --> 01:23:26.530
analysis and the 60s.
And it's,
it's a,
um,
it's a Ma a mechanism which

1403
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:33.390
allows someone to make as rational decision as possible by putting all of their

1404
01:23:34.421 --> 01:23:38.890
information about a topic into,
into,
uh,
uh,
essentially a calculation.

1405
01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:43.450
Um,
it's got nothing to do with,
with,
uh,
with line or our honesty.
But he's a,

1406
01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.410
he's a,
a,

1407
01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:49.000
a professor in the engineering economic systems department at Stanford and he as

1408
01:23:49.001 --> 01:23:52.900
kind of a sideline to his,
his academic work was teaching these,

1409
01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:55.210
these courses on ethics.

1410
01:23:55.211 --> 01:23:59.800
And one course was just on the question whether it's ever ethical to lie.

1411
01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:04.420
And so as a freshman I was just sort of put in the machine of this course and

1412
01:24:04.421 --> 01:24:09.370
came out the other side,
convinced that in virtually any situation,

1413
01:24:09.371 --> 01:24:12.190
apart from like a self defense situation where you would,

1414
01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:15.310
where things have really broken down and you're not in the presence of someone

1415
01:24:15.311 --> 01:24:19.240
who you're going to collaborate with line is just unacceptable.
It's just not,

1416
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:22.570
it's not how I want to live.
It's not how,
um,

1417
01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:25.300
anyone should want to live if they look at it closely enough.

1418
01:24:26.010 --> 01:24:31.010
<v 1>And it's really one of the huge problems that we have as a race is we,</v>

1419
01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:35.410
we know how to communicate.
We know how to,
uh,
we,

1420
01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:38.790
like when you were talking to that rabbi that we were talking about earlier and

1421
01:24:38.791 --> 01:24:41.270
he has this like very eloquent and you know,

1422
01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:45.260
very theatrical way of communicating.
And you know,
it's,
it's,
it's,

1423
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:48.300
it's kind of tricky because when someone's really good at that,

1424
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:51.240
you want to believe that they're telling the truth.

1425
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:56.370
You want to believe that someone who is lying to you in a very charismatic way

1426
01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:59.310
is telling you the truth until we actually can read each other's minds.

1427
01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:02.220
This is a lot of confusion that goes on in human interaction,

1428
01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.710
just bumping into each other,
just not getting anything done,

1429
01:25:04.711 --> 01:25:06.060
not figuring out what's really going on,

1430
01:25:06.061 --> 01:25:09.090
not figuring out the real relationship that you have to other people in your

1431
01:25:09.091 --> 01:25:09.990
life.
You know?

1432
01:25:09.991 --> 01:25:13.290
I know people that lie constantly and they never get their shit together.

1433
01:25:13.291 --> 01:25:15.300
They just have like these little lies here and they're like,

1434
01:25:15.301 --> 01:25:19.410
why didn't you call me back?
Ah,
this thing came up and it's always,
they just,

1435
01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:21.150
they and they're always in a mess.

1436
01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:24.990
There's just a mess and I think you're a hundred percent dead on.

1437
01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.260
I think that that,
that part,
that the be honest part,

1438
01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.490
that's one of the most critical aspects of human behavior.

1439
01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:35.040
We make an agreement with each other.
If you're going to be in my life,

1440
01:25:35.041 --> 01:25:37.950
we're going to be friends.
We have to be 100% honest with each other.

1441
01:25:38.190 --> 01:25:39.900
And as soon as someone's not 100% honest,

1442
01:25:39.930 --> 01:25:44.220
well then what percentage are your honest,
is it 90,
is it 80,
is it 70,

1443
01:25:44.221 --> 01:25:46.110
what do I gotta do?
I gotta throw everything through a filter.
This,

1444
01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:48.390
it's not worth it.
It's not worth it.

1445
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:51.520
<v 0>And then there's the question of whether you want to have a different ethical</v>

1446
01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:54.380
code for your friends and for strangers,
right?
And then you,
you,

1447
01:25:54.381 --> 01:25:59.381
you run into situations where the stranger suddenly is a friend and you are now

1448
01:25:59.831 --> 01:26:03.560
confronted with having had a different ethical code or you discover that this
is,

1449
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:07.340
this person is somebody who's brother and you just lied to them.
It's just,

1450
01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:10.340
it's not tenable to live this way.

1451
01:26:10.341 --> 01:26:13.400
And it's what I'm interested in are the,

1452
01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:17.390
the subtle ways that it erodes trust between people.

1453
01:26:17.391 --> 01:26:21.950
Because there's just one example I use in the book where a friend was out with

1454
01:26:21.951 --> 01:26:24.920
her,
her girlfriend,
and she wasn't like her best friend,

1455
01:26:24.921 --> 01:26:27.180
but they were very close friends.
And,
um,

1456
01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:31.820
the girlfriend was supposed have had plans later that night with another friend.

1457
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:36.920
Uh,
and didn't want to,
to have that plan.
And so this is,
you know,
a friend,

1458
01:26:36.921 --> 01:26:37.760
a watches,

1459
01:26:37.761 --> 01:26:42.761
her friend call up the third friend and lie about why she can't have plans and

1460
01:26:43.761 --> 01:26:47.240
she lied so convincingly and effortlessly and just it was just,
you know,

1461
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:49.250
there's something with her kid being sick,
whatever it was.

1462
01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:52.310
And then you got off the phone and then went back to the conversation with,

1463
01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.400
with friend day and what friend day experience in that moment was just a,

1464
01:26:57.770 --> 01:27:02.770
a subtle but absolutely obvious erosion of trust,

1465
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:06.440
like a permanent erosion of trust.
But it was,

1466
01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.810
it was something that could never be rectified because it was not,

1467
01:27:08.811 --> 01:27:12.890
they were not so close that she was going to perform an intervention there and

1468
01:27:12.891 --> 01:27:13.641
say,
look,
we know,

1469
01:27:13.641 --> 01:27:16.610
why are you lying and why do you do this and have you ever done this to me?

1470
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:21.850
She was just left with this vague sense that probably this woman had lied to her

1471
01:27:22.581 --> 01:27:24.980
in the past and would lie to her in the future.
And,

1472
01:27:25.610 --> 01:27:29.660
and we go through life like this with people and,
and people,
the people who are,

1473
01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:34.020
who are telling the little lies are just,
they're never,
I mean,
so the,
the,
the,

1474
01:27:34.021 --> 01:27:39.021
the liar and that case never knew that she had suddenly degraded her,

1475
01:27:39.230 --> 01:27:41.840
her friendship with the first friend.
Um,

1476
01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:45.020
and the things just don't get discovered and there it's very toxic.

1477
01:27:45.170 --> 01:27:47.870
I find also that people that lie or very difficult,

1478
01:27:47.871 --> 01:27:52.460
it seeing lies and others are very bad rather at seeing lies and others.

1479
01:27:52.461 --> 01:27:55.370
I think that people who are bullshitters can be bullshitted.

1480
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:58.580
People were con artists can be conned.
There's a,
there's a,

1481
01:27:58.850 --> 01:28:02.650
there's some sort of a disconnect that people have that don't live in,

1482
01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:06.440
especially in introspective,
really objective version of themselves.

1483
01:28:06.441 --> 01:28:09.380
Like really looking hard at all their issues.
If you're lying,

1484
01:28:09.381 --> 01:28:12.260
you're not doing that.
So if you're not,
if you don't,
you know,

1485
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:15.230
you might have some walls up that you might not know about and they could lead

1486
01:28:15.231 --> 01:28:18.980
to you getting lied to.
It's very possible.
Right,
right.
Oh,
to,
to go back to the,

1487
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:23.240
to the rabbi though.
I think in that case he wasn't lying.
I don't,
I don't think,

1488
01:28:23.241 --> 01:28:26.390
I think most religious people believe what they say.

1489
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:29.900
They believe in smart though.
I kind of think that's the,

1490
01:28:29.901 --> 01:28:33.380
that's the scary thing about it.
And that's it.
So this is not,
the,

1491
01:28:33.381 --> 01:28:36.700
certainly doesn't apply to a rabbi Wolpe but,
but,
uh,

1492
01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:41.270
this applies to the jihadist who thinks he's going to get 72 virgins in
paradise.

1493
01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:45.110
You can be smart and believe that.
And that's,
that's the scary thing.

1494
01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:50.111
You can be the engineer who could have had everything but decides to be a

1495
01:28:51.441 --> 01:28:56.441
jihadist because he believes that the afterlife conforms to the Quran and the

1496
01:28:57.321 --> 01:29:01.570
Hadoop and,
and that,
that is a,
um,
so I,
I mean,

1497
01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:05.490
deception is part of the game and self deception as part of the game,

1498
01:29:05.491 --> 01:29:09.480
but in many cases,
I think you have people who have been

1499
01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:16.670
indoctrinated from birth or get a message from their culture that,

1500
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:21.690
or get emotionally hijacked in ways that allow them to believe the unbelievable.

1501
01:29:22.110 --> 01:29:25.260
And then they're being perfectly honest when they,
when they spread those ideas,

1502
01:29:25.261 --> 01:29:29.680
they're not,
they're not frauds.
Um,
and that's,
that I think is,
um,
so it's,
it's,

1503
01:29:29.681 --> 01:29:31.440
it's a different problem.
It deception is,

1504
01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:35.460
is self deception is certainly a component in many of these cases.
But

1505
01:29:35.690 --> 01:29:39.440
<v 1>do you think it's possible that technology will eventually make lying obsolete?</v>

1506
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:42.300
Like what,
what we're seeing right now with this uh,

1507
01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:45.770
invasion of privacy thing with the NSA we're seeing in a,

1508
01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:50.210
it's a one sided trip obviously and then you have wiki leaks and Eric Snowden,

1509
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:51.680
they're the Eric,

1510
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:55.910
those name Edward Edward Edward Snowden or the or the other side releasing,

1511
01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:56.900
you know,

1512
01:29:56.900 --> 01:30:01.900
scratch bits of information that they can scratch together and smuggle out.

1513
01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:06.410
But it seems to me like that's where the trend is ultimately going.

1514
01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:09.680
The trend is ultimately going to,
you're not going to,
like,

1515
01:30:09.681 --> 01:30:12.920
if you send someone a picture of your Dick Online,
it's going to be out there.

1516
01:30:12.921 --> 01:30:17.390
Someone's going to get that.
If you,
you know,
if you send a blank,
if this happens,

1517
01:30:17.391 --> 01:30:20.060
if that happens,
if you know,
if it's all going to be recorded,

1518
01:30:20.061 --> 01:30:21.110
you've got to know where you were.

1519
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:23.930
You have a gps chip on your phone or your Google glass.

1520
01:30:23.931 --> 01:30:26.900
It knows exactly where you were.
If records you all the time.

1521
01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:31.310
I think this NSA thing is fucking terrible.
I think it's terrible.

1522
01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:36.110
Mostly because it's the government that has all the power in this situation.

1523
01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:38.780
It's these people that are,
they're not using it.

1524
01:30:38.781 --> 01:30:42.150
I mean the idea is that they are using it to prevent terrorism.
I see.

1525
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:43.460
I guess maybe,

1526
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:47.510
but there's so much evidence that points to the fact they were spying on other

1527
01:30:47.511 --> 01:30:49.580
world leaders that they didn't think were terrorists there.

1528
01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:54.780
It's essentially using it as a vehicle for control and but it brings up a

1529
01:30:55.251 --> 01:31:00.251
fascinating new area of technology and that is this,

1530
01:31:01.101 --> 01:31:04.820
this new era that we're entering into where everything's getting closer and

1531
01:31:04.821 --> 01:31:09.560
closer and closer to the point where one day we're going to have this one

1532
01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:13.280
database that we all draw from all the time.
If we have the internet,

1533
01:31:13.490 --> 01:31:17.210
we're going to have something that it's like a pair of glasses or like something

1534
01:31:17.211 --> 01:31:20.600
that you were inside your skin or or something that's going to allow everybody

1535
01:31:20.601 --> 01:31:23.360
to be connected all over the place.
I don't know how we're going to manage it,

1536
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:27.020
but all that information we're going to be able to get to it.

1537
01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:29.150
I'm going to be able to know what you had for lunch today.

1538
01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:32.660
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah.
Well there's,
there's,
so there's that component.
There's the,</v>

1539
01:31:32.661 --> 01:31:37.050
just the sheer transparency based on having so much data.
Uh,
yeah.

1540
01:31:37.210 --> 01:31:41.530
But there's this other technological fix for deception,

1541
01:31:41.531 --> 01:31:46.150
which is just actual lie detection.
And I think that is coming.

1542
01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:51.240
I think there's no question that at some point we are going to have lie

1543
01:31:51.731 --> 01:31:54.220
detection that where it may not be perfect,

1544
01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:59.520
but it will be valid enough and reliable enough that we rely on it,

1545
01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:03.730
uh,
in the way that we rely on DNA evidence.
So as if it's,

1546
01:32:03.731 --> 01:32:07.000
if it was your DNA at the scene,
you know,
we,
we,

1547
01:32:07.001 --> 01:32:12.001
we think you're involved if you are caught lying as measured by this machine

1548
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:15.850
where we're going to think you're lying and that's going to be,
you know,

1549
01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:18.160
forensically actionable.
I think that's it.
We're not,

1550
01:32:18.161 --> 01:32:20.860
we're certainly not there yet,
but I think that it would,

1551
01:32:20.890 --> 01:32:23.050
it would really surprise me if we don't get there.

1552
01:32:23.530 --> 01:32:25.620
<v 1>I wanted to talk to you about this because I had a,</v>

1553
01:32:25.630 --> 01:32:28.720
one of your colleagues on my show,
a Joe Rogan questions,
everything.

1554
01:32:28.721 --> 01:32:32.560
I can't remember her name right now.
Blonde woman,
Pam,

1555
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:36.060
Pam Douglas,
I believe so.
I believe that was who it was.
Yeah.

1556
01:32:36.490 --> 01:32:38.160
And she was talking about Fmr,

1557
01:32:38.170 --> 01:32:41.320
I results and how a woman was actually convicted of a murder.

1558
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:44.110
I believe it was in India because of Fmr.

1559
01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:49.120
I that she had what they called functional knowledge of the crime scene.

1560
01:32:49.450 --> 01:32:50.950
Right,
right.
Yeah.
See on another,

1561
01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:56.050
I think that strikes almost any neuroscientists as a

1562
01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:01.290
<v 0>premature use of the technology.
Uh,
and in that case you're talking about a,</v>

1563
01:33:01.291 --> 01:33:03.930
um,
um,
I mean at that,
I think that,

1564
01:33:03.970 --> 01:33:06.440
I think that mode of inquiry is problematic because you're,

1565
01:33:06.441 --> 01:33:07.274
you're talking about just,

1566
01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:12.380
just familiarity with the crime scene or would it with the evidence and there

1567
01:33:13.051 --> 01:33:18.030
are clearly other sources of familiarity and,
and you know,
if,
if,

1568
01:33:18.031 --> 01:33:18.660
if the,

1569
01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:22.770
if the dead girl is wearing a dress that you just bought out of the j crew

1570
01:33:22.771 --> 01:33:27.250
catalog,
you're familiar with the dress.
And I don't know that they have a,

1571
01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:30.000
I don't know that they've operationalized us in the way that that will,

1572
01:33:30.001 --> 01:33:34.500
will protect you from just,
just accidentally being familiar with the,
with the,

1573
01:33:35.010 --> 01:33:37.600
um,
uh,
some features of the crime scene,
uh,

1574
01:33:37.710 --> 01:33:42.370
to say nothing of the fact that we just cannot resolve brain function that clear

1575
01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:46.340
clearly enough to,
to,
uh,

1576
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:51.240
base those kinds of decisions on,
on a judgment that the person is,

1577
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:55.320
is lying or not.
Uh,
we don't understand that the,
the neural correlates of,

1578
01:33:55.710 --> 01:33:58.920
of honesty and deception enough to know,
but it's,

1579
01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:03.480
I think it would be very surprising if we never get there.
And so,
so,

1580
01:34:03.490 --> 01:34:08.190
and again,
we're now,
I'm just speculating if it was Pam on your bluejay hours.

1581
01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:11.040
Um,
she actually took,
she was a name again Pamela.

1582
01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:14.320
Pamela Douglas is the woman I'm thinking of.
She was like,

1583
01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:18.840
she was a graduate student in the lab I was in at Ucla and she,

1584
01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:23.610
after I did a,
um,
after I did a study of belief,

1585
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:24.833
um,

1586
01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:29.490
where I compared belief and disbelief and uncertainty with Smri,

1587
01:34:29.970 --> 01:34:30.390
uh,

1588
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:35.390
she came back and re and used all of my data to look to,

1589
01:34:35.650 --> 01:34:40.650
to see if she could discriminate what subjects believed at the single trial

1590
01:34:40.801 --> 01:34:42.740
level,
which is at,
on,
on each question.
So,

1591
01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:46.770
so what I did is I put subjects on a scanner and I gave them propositions to

1592
01:34:46.771 --> 01:34:51.540
read that we either clearly true are clearly falls are clearly undecidable and

1593
01:34:52.110 --> 01:34:55.620
just compared belief versus disbelief versus uncertainty.

1594
01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:59.030
And that is if you could that,
if you could do that at the single trial level,

1595
01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.640
you essentially have a,
a lie detector.

1596
01:35:01.641 --> 01:35:06.170
Because if you believe that you were the person who committed the crime,

1597
01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:09.060
uh,
and we can,
we have a,

1598
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:12.530
a understanding of the neural correlates of belief versus disbelief,

1599
01:35:12.531 --> 01:35:14.290
then we could easily ask you,
you know,

1600
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:18.170
whether you were involved in a way that would tease that out.
So she,

1601
01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:21.820
she wanted to see whether we could,
uh,

1602
01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:25.730
see the difference between belief and disbelief and uncertainty.
Uh,
at the,

1603
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:28.430
at the micro level,
just,
just a,
you know,

1604
01:35:28.450 --> 01:35:32.330
on a single question level and her,
her,
um,

1605
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:36.260
classifiers were over 90% accurate.
So as she was,

1606
01:35:36.261 --> 01:35:38.480
she was over 90% in,

1607
01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:41.390
in guessing essentially whether someone was,

1608
01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:45.950
could believed or disbelieved a proposition.
Uh,
and so if you had any,

1609
01:35:47.150 --> 01:35:51.680
it's easy to see how we would now with available technology have a lie detector

1610
01:35:52.190 --> 01:35:53.720
that was 90% accurate.

1611
01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:57.500
Now that's not accurate enough to put people away and you know,
for,

1612
01:35:57.501 --> 01:35:58.760
for misstatements in court.

1613
01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:04.120
But if we could get it to the level of accuracy that we now rely on for DNA

1614
01:36:05.601 --> 01:36:10.220
evidence,
uh,
I think we would,
it's,
it's,
it's,

1615
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:13.850
it's an interesting question philosophically and experimentally how we'd ever

1616
01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:18.800
bridged that gap and how we'd ever be truly confident that no matter what sort

1617
01:36:18.801 --> 01:36:23.340
of histrionics and protestations this person is lying,

1618
01:36:23.341 --> 01:36:26.180
this though this person is,
is,
is claims,
you know,

1619
01:36:26.181 --> 01:36:28.550
on his mother's life that he's telling the truth.

1620
01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:31.400
The brain scan evidence says otherwise.

1621
01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:35.780
Somehow I feel like that is going to be harder to achieve.
Then,

1622
01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:40.280
uh,
him saying it's not my blood is not my blood is not my blood,

1623
01:36:40.281 --> 01:36:42.700
but the DNA evidence says otherwise.
Um,

1624
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:46.580
but in principle I don't see any reason why we couldn't get there and that,

1625
01:36:46.581 --> 01:36:50.210
and that I think would change things a lot because when you look at the price we

1626
01:36:50.211 --> 01:36:54.410
pay for not being able to determine whether someone is lying.

1627
01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:56.390
It is huge.
I mean,
it is,

1628
01:36:56.391 --> 01:36:59.320
I mean we were talking about there are people in prison for the rest of the

1629
01:36:59.330 --> 01:37:02.810
people who have gone to death row and been executed who we know were innocent.

1630
01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:07.370
You know,
the,
there's not just one.
Oh yeah.
I mean,
and,
and in the most horrific,

1631
01:37:07.710 --> 01:37:11.320
I mean there was this one guy whose name is now escaping me,
but,
um,

1632
01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:16.360
there was a new Yorker profile on him where his house burned down and he was

1633
01:37:17.061 --> 01:37:21.830
charged with the crime of having set the fire and killing his two kids.

1634
01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:26.750
Now imagine being someone whose house burned down and your two kids die in the

1635
01:37:26.751 --> 01:37:31.130
fire and the world thinks you did it.
And not only do they think you did it,

1636
01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:34.130
they prosecute you,
your defense fails,

1637
01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:39.160
you go to death row and you're executed right for the crime of having murdered

1638
01:37:39.171 --> 01:37:41.000
your children.
Um,
uh,

1639
01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:46.300
now that if we could just tell whether someone was telling the truth that that

1640
01:37:46.641 --> 01:37:50.950
problem goes away and we're,
and,
and they're,
you know,
they're,
think of,

1641
01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:54.830
think of the,
the implications of,
um,

1642
01:37:55.710 --> 01:37:56.011
you know,

1643
01:37:56.011 --> 01:38:01.011
negotiation among the leaders of countries where you don't know whether people

1644
01:38:01.171 --> 01:38:05.430
were telling the truth and we do or do not have nuclear weapons.

1645
01:38:05.431 --> 01:38:07.560
You don't know whether they're telling I if,
if,

1646
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:11.730
if there was transparency at the level of all for all of those conversations,

1647
01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:12.813
it would

1648
01:38:12.970 --> 01:38:14.650
<v 2>really be a game changer.
Not only that,</v>

1649
01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:17.530
women will have to finally accept what men actually think.

1650
01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:19.390
We could stop bullshitting.

1651
01:38:19.730 --> 01:38:23.050
We could stop sex in the city and notebooking our way through this life.
Well,

1652
01:38:23.190 --> 01:38:25.360
that would be nice.
We'd also have to find out what women think.

1653
01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:30.280
It could be a revelation.
It will be awful.
Well,
it'd be great,
but you know,

1654
01:38:30.281 --> 01:38:32.110
for a while it'd be awful.
Do you,

1655
01:38:32.170 --> 01:38:36.880
what do you think that that ultimately is going to lead to the change that we

1656
01:38:36.881 --> 01:38:39.580
need and world governments?
Is that what the big one is going to be?

1657
01:38:39.581 --> 01:38:42.100
The ability to discern whether or not people are telling the truth.

1658
01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:46.540
Because if that set seems like just that alone would change everything.

1659
01:38:46.570 --> 01:38:48.790
If you could see clearly motivations,

1660
01:38:48.791 --> 01:38:51.370
you could see clearly benefits to certain actions.

1661
01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:55.490
You can clearly see deceptive tactics based on,
you know,
well,
you know,

1662
01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:58.240
really what they're trying to do is this,
you know,
read it out.

1663
01:38:58.270 --> 01:39:00.820
You know what they're actually trying to do is make money for x corporation.

1664
01:39:00.821 --> 01:39:04.510
They're pretending that they're trying to save the country from an evil
dictator,

1665
01:39:04.511 --> 01:39:07.360
but really what they're trying to do is extract resources.
Here's the clear data,

1666
01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:10.750
like what do we do if we have everything out on the table?

1667
01:39:10.751 --> 01:39:12.470
What a weird world we would live in.
It would it?

1668
01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:16.990
That could be the total 100% game changer.
Even bigger in fact than the Internet.

1669
01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:21.570
If we could find out what everybody actually thinks.
Yeah,
I,
there,

1670
01:39:21.571 --> 01:39:25.990
there are a few wrinkles to it.
Cause if you were self deceived,

1671
01:39:25.991 --> 01:39:27.850
if you actually believed what you said,

1672
01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:30.620
<v 0>we're saying,
but you're,
what you're saying is not true,</v>

1673
01:39:31.490 --> 01:39:35.750
then you can sort of game the system like a lie detector test.
Yeah.
I mean so,

1674
01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:40.610
so well,
you know,
if we had,
if we totally understood the,

1675
01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:44.600
the neural neural correlates of deception,

1676
01:39:44.930 --> 01:39:49.930
we wouldn't necessarily be able to detect someone who believed their own lives

1677
01:39:50.091 --> 01:39:51.250
and there may be some way to,

1678
01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:56.340
to be confused enough or confabulate stick enough about reality that you can

1679
01:39:57.741 --> 01:40:02.350
just bullshit or spit ball or,
or,
um,

1680
01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:05.330
say what you want to be true or kind of hypnotize yourself.
I mean,

1681
01:40:05.331 --> 01:40:09.340
we just don't actually know what's true at the level of,
of the minds.

1682
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:12.440
You cognitive elasticity.
So you,
so it's,

1683
01:40:12.441 --> 01:40:17.441
it's possible that you could have people who are not good subjects of lie

1684
01:40:17.481 --> 01:40:20.720
detection in some sense.
And,
um,
that's something we could,

1685
01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:25.520
we would understand if we understood all this.
Uh,
but I think in the,
uh,

1686
01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:30.440
in the general case,
uh,
and certainly in the case of big lies,

1687
01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:32.780
virtually all the time,

1688
01:40:32.781 --> 01:40:37.781
the liar knows he's lying and is hoping not to get caught and is picking his

1689
01:40:37.881 --> 01:40:41.690
words carefully so as not to get caught and keeping track of the things he said.

1690
01:40:42.250 --> 01:40:43.310
Uh,
and,

1691
01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:48.760
and is consciously calculating against the expectations of cogency and,

1692
01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:54.550
and,
uh,
um,
uh,
plausibility in his audience.
I mean,

1693
01:40:54.551 --> 01:40:59.290
there's a massive calculation going on virtually all of which is conscious in a

1694
01:40:59.291 --> 01:41:02.410
liar.
And it seems to me that that is,

1695
01:41:03.010 --> 01:41:05.980
it's going to be detectable in with great,
reliable,

1696
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:08.440
<v 2>the,
at some point it just seems like it's inevitable.</v>

1697
01:41:08.441 --> 01:41:11.200
What everything progress's everything gets better.

1698
01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:13.930
And that's something they're working on a,
on a constant basis,

1699
01:41:13.931 --> 01:41:18.240
whether it's a hundred years from now or 200 years from now,
what people will,

1700
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:19.450
they'll hate this.

1701
01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:24.460
<v 0>The Orwellian,
uh,
fears of the,</v>

1702
01:41:24.461 --> 01:41:28.610
of the misuse of this or the fears about the war or William misuse of this are

1703
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:33.730
pretty easy to,
to,
um,
uh,
get ahold of.
And,
and I think,

1704
01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:35.153
um,

1705
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:40.350
people feel like there's that kind of the last and most,

1706
01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:46.480
uh,
critical,
uh,
uh,

1707
01:41:46.810 --> 01:41:49.330
loss of cognitive liberty,
I may say.
So if,
if you,

1708
01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:54.360
if you didn't have the fundamental right to privacy that could be safeguarded by

1709
01:41:55.601 --> 01:41:57.330
lies,
uh,

1710
01:41:58.210 --> 01:42:01.270
something crucial to our humanity has been lost.

1711
01:42:01.271 --> 01:42:04.090
I think many people will feel that.
And it would,

1712
01:42:04.091 --> 01:42:08.490
won't matter how high you pile the benefits.
I mean,

1713
01:42:08.491 --> 01:42:10.580
you talk about the guy who was in prison for and,

1714
01:42:10.590 --> 01:42:12.700
and killed and he didn't kill his daughters,

1715
01:42:12.701 --> 01:42:17.120
but we thought he did and we killed him.
And you multiply that guy by 100,000.
Uh,

1716
01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:18.700
and you talk about,
you know,

1717
01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:23.800
treaties and deceptions at the level of nation states where millions of lives

1718
01:42:23.891 --> 01:42:27.790
hang in the balance.
Um,
there are people who are going to say,
no,
no,

1719
01:42:28.150 --> 01:42:32.670
this is not acceptable.
And,
and I,
I think,
um,
and they'll,

1720
01:42:32.671 --> 01:42:35.430
they'll have a few points on their side,
but I think the,
the,

1721
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:40.510
the cost to us personally and economically and socially for consequential lives,

1722
01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:43.450
um,
I'm not,

1723
01:42:43.451 --> 01:42:47.050
I'm not imagining a world where we would have lie detection technology running

1724
01:42:47.051 --> 01:42:50.320
all the time so that every time you,
you know,
someone says,
how are you?

1725
01:42:50.321 --> 01:42:52.610
And you say I'm fine but you're actually not fine.
And then some,

1726
01:42:52.611 --> 01:42:55.450
a red light's going to go off on your sweater,
Turkey test.
Yeah.

1727
01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:57.370
I mean there's nothing,
there's not,
um,

1728
01:42:57.790 --> 01:42:59.830
I don't think any of us would want to live in that world.

1729
01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:04.540
But when the stakes are high and conversations matter,

1730
01:43:04.541 --> 01:43:07.690
and even just in court say,
you know,
the conversation is,

1731
01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:12.490
is important enough and a consequential enough that it has now moved into a

1732
01:43:12.491 --> 01:43:16.980
court and we've got lawyers on both sides and now we've got people swearing o's

1733
01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:20.950
of honesty.
Let's have this conversation under,
in a,

1734
01:43:20.951 --> 01:43:25.330
in a framework where we know that lies will be detected.
I think,

1735
01:43:25.390 --> 01:43:28.240
I think any sane person is going to sign up for that.

1736
01:43:29.250 --> 01:43:32.490
<v 2>He says on the pro,
the,
the,
the progression though,
that's always existed.</v>

1737
01:43:32.491 --> 01:43:36.430
Like people were resisting books,
you know,
when books were first printed.
Yeah.

1738
01:43:36.450 --> 01:43:41.090
Cause it was going to erode our,
our memory,
which it probably did,
but uh,
yeah,

1739
01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:45.780
they,
they thought that was something crucial to our happiness would be lost by,

1740
01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:50.100
by,
uh,
by literacy.
Well,
there's a lot of people that also believe going online.

1741
01:43:50.101 --> 01:43:52.280
It's bad.
I've talked to lot of people that take pride

1742
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:56.000
<v 1>in not going online.
I think it's hilarious and it's like,
dude,
do you know,</v>

1743
01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:59.590
you're just the guy that doesn't like books.
You're the same guy and the guy,

1744
01:43:59.930 --> 01:44:01.130
you're the guy who doesn't want a cell phone.

1745
01:44:01.131 --> 01:44:04.010
If you don't want them people to know where you are and you want to be free,

1746
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:08.390
those days are gone,
man.
Those days are gone.
There's a new world going on.

1747
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:11.180
By the way,
if you're driving around your car,
everybody knows who you are.

1748
01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:14.210
They can find you.
It's super easy.
You know,
you have a gps in there.

1749
01:44:14.211 --> 01:44:17.660
It's very unique.
Like try,
it's,
if they lived,
the police need to find you.

1750
01:44:17.690 --> 01:44:20.400
They trace it,
they find you instantly.
So I like you.

1751
01:44:20.410 --> 01:44:22.340
You're not hiding like there's no hiding anymore.

1752
01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:24.480
<v 0>Yeah.
Although it's interesting.</v>

1753
01:44:24.481 --> 01:44:29.481
I don't know it clearly there are some form of progress that is um,

1754
01:44:33.150 --> 01:44:38.150
harmful and you could be only dimly aware or just sheerly oblivious to the harms

1755
01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:42.900
a until after it's too late.
And I,
I,
I'm not sure how,

1756
01:44:43.590 --> 01:44:46.050
I mean just speaking personally,
my own use of,

1757
01:44:46.051 --> 01:44:49.680
of the Internet and my use of the way in which my,

1758
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:55.470
my day gets segmented by the checking of email and,
and just,
uh,
it just,

1759
01:44:55.471 --> 01:44:59.910
the way I can disappear online in the middle of a conversation,
you have to,

1760
01:44:59.911 --> 01:45:01.710
I think we all have to be mindful of what that,

1761
01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:05.070
what that's doing to us and very good point.
And it's,
um,
I mean,

1762
01:45:05.071 --> 01:45:08.770
just to be on the phone with someone and also be checking your email.
I mean,

1763
01:45:08.771 --> 01:45:12.630
that's something that,
that you can in a very lazy way,

1764
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:17.670
just do more times than not.
And it's,
it's a,
um,
it's,

1765
01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:21.270
uh,
they're now a thousand moments like that,
that we all confront.

1766
01:45:21.271 --> 01:45:25.850
And if we're not,
if we're not aware of,
of how it's playing with,
um,

1767
01:45:26.670 --> 01:45:28.140
the fabric of our lives,
that you just,

1768
01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:32.840
you can just wake up one day with a very fragmented kind of attention and,
um,

1769
01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:38.040
uh,
it's just a,
um,
it's just,
uh,
it's,
it's,
it's a less satisfying,

1770
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:41.040
there's something about multitasking that is,
I think,

1771
01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:45.600
intrinsically stressful and not rewarding,

1772
01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:48.870
<v 1>but you know what the real issue is?
It's not really multitasking.
Yeah.
No.</v>

1773
01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:51.740
You're sitting there and someone's checking their phone.

1774
01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:55.090
They're not really talking,
you know,
you're just,
you're just segmenting your,

1775
01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:56.473
the experience.

1776
01:45:56.540 --> 01:46:00.050
I was at a dinner the other day and there was four dudes and they were all on

1777
01:46:00.051 --> 01:46:02.180
their phone.
I was like,
this is the craziest shit ever.

1778
01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:04.940
Like no one's talking to anybody.
We're all just looking at our phones.
Like,

1779
01:46:04.941 --> 01:46:08.930
this has bananas.
Like,
let's make an agreement.
Shut these bitches off.
Or an hour.

1780
01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:11.990
Wow.
My kids,
you know,
I don't want it.
Then what if someone calls,
you know,

1781
01:46:11.991 --> 01:46:16.460
work is in the middle of the deal.
Nobody wants to just d two,
and,
you know,

1782
01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:20.450
vacation,
we'll do what I'm vacation.
She,
I didn't check my email for five days.

1783
01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:25.100
It was like a big deal.
You disconnected from the fucking hive.
You're crazy.

1784
01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:30.230
What do you make of this whole NSA privacy thing?

1785
01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:31.790
Do you think that can be rectified?

1786
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.730
It seems like when the genie's out of the bottle with something like that,

1787
01:46:34.731 --> 01:46:38.810
like once they can do that and then once they justify doing that,
like,
you know,

1788
01:46:39.250 --> 01:46:43.460
and not all that Obama has been lying about it,
like left and right.

1789
01:46:43.461 --> 01:46:46.940
It's fascinating when you find out that he oversaw a lot of these,

1790
01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:50.100
these decisions to,
to,
to spy on people

1791
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:52.280
<v 2>and there's a lot of things that were done during the Bush administration before</v>

1792
01:46:52.281 --> 01:46:56.370
him.
Uh,
would that go way back to 2002?
Yeah.
German counselor,

1793
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:59.490
Counselor Confronts Obama about us spying on her cell phone.

1794
01:46:59.670 --> 01:47:03.730
Why didn't you spy and the German chancellor,
do you think she's a terrorist?

1795
01:47:03.731 --> 01:47:05.460
Is she evil when they're like that?

1796
01:47:05.461 --> 01:47:07.290
I mean that we have this history of espionage,

1797
01:47:07.291 --> 01:47:11.490
which in which that is just clearly something you would do.

1798
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:12.990
That one

1799
01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:17.890
<v 0>problem here is just that.
And this is one of the consequences of,</v>

1800
01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:23.250
of um,
increasing transparency,
uh,

1801
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:25.350
when,
when one,

1802
01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:30.100
certain facts or acknowledged people have to respond to them.
There's,

1803
01:47:30.101 --> 01:47:34.150
there's a,
you know,
I know,
you know,
and you know that I know that,
you know,

1804
01:47:34.180 --> 01:47:37.660
and now this is now this what was a,

1805
01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:42.430
essentially an open secret has to be explicitly talked about and reacted to.

1806
01:47:42.431 --> 01:47:44.470
And so everyone knew for,

1807
01:47:44.890 --> 01:47:49.890
for decades that we would make every effort we could to spy on everyone we cared

1808
01:47:51.791 --> 01:47:54.370
about spying on.
And that is as allies and enemies.

1809
01:47:54.610 --> 01:47:59.020
And everyone did it insofar as their resources allow.

1810
01:47:59.021 --> 01:48:01.990
And that is just what has always happened.

1811
01:48:01.991 --> 01:48:05.660
But the moment you actually put too fine a point on it and,

1812
01:48:05.661 --> 01:48:10.380
and declare the Angela Merkel's cell phone has,

1813
01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:15.430
has been bugged by the,
the NSA or the CIA,
um,
that is,

1814
01:48:15.431 --> 01:48:19.300
uh,
intolerable.
And it's just,
it's not a,
it's,

1815
01:48:20.110 --> 01:48:24.050
it's a little bit like,
um,
what would happen to us a,

1816
01:48:24.051 --> 01:48:28.330
if we saw a photo of everyone we killed in war,

1817
01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:33.310
you know,
if,
if,
if it was just all transparent,
what kind of war is,

1818
01:48:33.311 --> 01:48:36.730
would we actually emotionally tolerate?
It might,
this might be a good thing.

1819
01:48:36.731 --> 01:48:39.400
It might be a bad thing.
It might be.
It might be.

1820
01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.150
We might be defenseless because we would find the,
the,

1821
01:48:44.010 --> 01:48:49.010
the act of waging war so unconscionable that we wouldn't do it or we'd be slow

1822
01:48:50.531 --> 01:48:55.360
enough to do it,
that we would be,
you know,
sitting ducks.
And so,
um,

1823
01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:58.680
I dunno,
I mean,
I just have,
this is just a big question mark there.
How much,
Eh,

1824
01:48:58.750 --> 01:49:03.750
there are cases in which true information is,

1825
01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:09.480
prevents you from being able to do something that you actually would want to do

1826
01:49:10.330 --> 01:49:11.100
or,
and,
and,

1827
01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:16.100
and perhaps should want to do to protect people who need to be protected,

1828
01:49:16.930 --> 01:49:20.900
<v 2>uh,
protect people from the realities of the world that they're not necessarily</v>

1829
01:49:20.901 --> 01:49:23.960
aware of,
that they haven't come to grips with like that.

1830
01:49:23.961 --> 01:49:26.070
Some people aren't looking for your best interest.

1831
01:49:26.071 --> 01:49:29.690
Some people will shoot a 15 year old girl on a bus because she wants to read

1832
01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:32.630
that these people are real people and you're not going to change them.

1833
01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:35.930
You're not going to enlighten them instantaneously in less.
You know,

1834
01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:38.500
that's the next invention.
And until then,
you,

1835
01:49:38.530 --> 01:49:41.120
you're going to have to deal with the realities of the world you live in.
Yeah.

1836
01:49:41.121 --> 01:49:43.660
It was so,
so either we should

1837
01:49:43.770 --> 01:49:46.560
<v 0>have espionage or we shouldn't.</v>

1838
01:49:46.710 --> 01:49:49.660
Now there's a lot of people think there shouldn't be a CIA,

1839
01:49:49.661 --> 01:49:54.510
there shouldn't be an NSA.
There's something,
couldn't JFK.
Um,

1840
01:49:54.910 --> 01:49:57.580
yeah.
So it's just if you're one of those people,

1841
01:49:57.581 --> 01:49:59.710
if you think we shouldn't be spying on anyone,

1842
01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:04.990
then obviously anything we do in that sphere is,
is unethical and,

1843
01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:09.440
um,
uh,
problematic.
But I'm not one of those people.

1844
01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:14.290
It's obvious that,
that we want information that people don't want to give us.

1845
01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:17.400
And that's,
and this is information that relates to,

1846
01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:21.850
to the most consequential things that could possibly happen.
Nuclear,
terrorism.

1847
01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:22.091
I mean,

1848
01:50:22.091 --> 01:50:27.091
we want to know if someone is trying to get loose nukes in the former Soviet

1849
01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:32.050
Union and blow up an American city,
they're not going to tell us.

1850
01:50:32.590 --> 01:50:35.260
And if there's any way to find out,

1851
01:50:35.290 --> 01:50:39.760
so as to interdict that process,
um,
uh,

1852
01:50:40.750 --> 01:50:42.520
that's,
let's call that espionage.

1853
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:46.270
And that's going to be a matter of tapping people's phones or watching their

1854
01:50:46.271 --> 01:50:50.560
email or,
and,
and so,
and if you just have to imagine how you would feel if

1855
01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:53.470
a new goes off in the,

1856
01:50:53.530 --> 01:50:58.480
in the port of Los Angeles killing 150,000 people and making a region of Los

1857
01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:03.070
Angeles uninhabitable for,
for decades,
uh,
if not more.
Um,

1858
01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:08.860
how would you feel if the NSA said,
yet,
you know,
we actually,

1859
01:51:08.861 --> 01:51:13.000
we had the technology to detect all of those machinations that led to that

1860
01:51:13.090 --> 01:51:15.490
catastrophe,
but we decided not to use it.

1861
01:51:15.970 --> 01:51:20.240
We decided not to use it because Glenn Greenwald made enough noise that it was

1862
01:51:20.241 --> 01:51:22.450
just became politically inconvenient for us to use it.

1863
01:51:22.451 --> 01:51:26.200
Or we were respecting the rights of people to,
you know,

1864
01:51:26.201 --> 01:51:29.510
to have private evil thoughts that we weren't good.
We just didn't,
we,

1865
01:51:29.530 --> 01:51:31.390
it was something unsavory about reading email.

1866
01:51:31.391 --> 01:51:33.280
We didn't want to tap anyone's cell phone.

1867
01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:38.650
I think we would clearly the price is the price for that kind of delicacy is too

1868
01:51:38.651 --> 01:51:42.230
high in the aftermath of that kind of event.
So if you live,

1869
01:51:42.250 --> 01:51:46.630
if you live in a world where you think that,
uh,
or,

1870
01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:50.170
or if you think we live in a world where those events are,
are not only possible,

1871
01:51:50.171 --> 01:51:54.910
but there are people waking up tomorrow morning trying to do that.
Um,

1872
01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:58.000
then I,
I think you want some level of,
of,

1873
01:51:58.030 --> 01:52:02.980
of very energetic eavesdropping on certain people.
And,
and then,

1874
01:52:03.010 --> 01:52:04.570
then the question is just where do you draw the line?

1875
01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:08.170
And you get like a TSA pre exemption,
like one of those things,

1876
01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:11.260
but now you can do TSA pre,
they know you're not a terrorist,
right?
Oh,

1877
01:52:11.261 --> 01:52:13.730
you're Sam Harris,
the writer.
You can just go right through it.

1878
01:52:13.810 --> 01:52:15.250
But the only way or you're exempt is,

1879
01:52:15.251 --> 01:52:18.730
is to invite that intrusion into your life and the first place.
It's true.
Yeah.

1880
01:52:18.810 --> 01:52:20.320
So you have to be willing to,

1881
01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:24.580
to part with some kind of private isn't mean to be the devil's advocate position

1882
01:52:24.581 --> 01:52:27.640
would,
would be that there's a reason why these people were upset at us.

1883
01:52:27.641 --> 01:52:30.220
We're occupying Holy Land,
we're doing terrible things,

1884
01:52:30.221 --> 01:52:31.810
were stealing the resources.

1885
01:52:32.050 --> 01:52:34.900
There's a lot of things that the United States is doing that actually promotes

1886
01:52:34.901 --> 01:52:37.240
this radical jihad.
Well,

1887
01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:39.970
to some degree that's true.

1888
01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:45.120
Most of that is based on their religious perception of the world and the first

1889
01:52:45.651 --> 01:52:48.110
place.
So that,
I mean there's so many of these grievances are,

1890
01:52:48.130 --> 01:52:52.070
are w w liberals tend to describe them as political,
but,

1891
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:55.340
but they're actually religious grievances.
So you know,
if the,

1892
01:52:55.341 --> 01:53:00.341
if the Saudis invite us in to help secure the oil wells,

1893
01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:05.150
that Saddam Hussein is threatening,
right?

1894
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:09.290
Someone like Osama bin Ladin perceives that as the sacrilege of having an

1895
01:53:09.291 --> 01:53:13.160
infertile boots on the ground in the Holy Land,
right.
That end.

1896
01:53:13.190 --> 01:53:15.350
And then someone like Glenn Greenwald,

1897
01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:19.460
we'll describe that as a political grievance.
That's a religious grievance.

1898
01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:20.323
That is,
that is,

1899
01:53:20.630 --> 01:53:25.630
we were invited in by a government in that case to protect oil wells.

1900
01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:28.760
Uh,
we're not stealing the oil.
We're buying the oil.

1901
01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:31.910
And I mean this is a bit disingenuous because Saddam wasn't really a religious

1902
01:53:31.911 --> 01:53:36.470
guy.
Oh no,
he,
no,
he,
he's,
he was not religious,
but he was using and he won.

1903
01:53:36.471 --> 01:53:38.420
He was tamping down the,

1904
01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:42.830
the religious sectarianism of the Iraqi people,
which,
you know,

1905
01:53:42.831 --> 01:53:47.610
with a moment we removed him,
can chaos exploded.
Um,
but so,
so hoop,
but what,

1906
01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.990
who gets the blame for all of that?
It's like,
wait,

1907
01:53:49.991 --> 01:53:54.650
we've got Sunni and Shia killing each other based on,
is that politics,

1908
01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:58.420
we can call it politics,
but that,
that is religious sectarianism,
no questions.

1909
01:53:58.450 --> 01:54:01.280
And in that way it can actually be argued that it was better for the people that

1910
01:54:01.281 --> 01:54:04.580
have that ruthless dictator in power than it is to have the United States sort

1911
01:54:04.581 --> 01:54:09.070
of loosely helping them govern themselves.
I don't agree with that obviously.
Um,

1912
01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:10.310
I think,
you know,

1913
01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:14.780
ultimately the best thing for everybody would be some sort of a compromise.

1914
01:54:14.781 --> 01:54:18.110
But when you look at the fact that these people are both Muslims,

1915
01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:21.590
they just have a different sect of Muslim,
of Islam and they,

1916
01:54:21.710 --> 01:54:23.840
they kill each other like on a regular basis.

1917
01:54:23.841 --> 01:54:25.610
Like the amount of slaughter involved in.

1918
01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:28.070
Most people don't even know that that's going on.
We're not,

1919
01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:29.410
we're not paying attention to it.
It's,
it,

1920
01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:33.620
it shows up on your page eight of the New York Times sometimes.
But you know,

1921
01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:37.400
sometimes,
but,
but the,
the um,
I mean this is,

1922
01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:40.890
that's one thing you have to keep in mind whenever you hear,
uh,

1923
01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:43.760
people rail against us,

1924
01:54:43.761 --> 01:54:48.761
foreign policy being the engine is driving this global jihad and Muslim

1925
01:54:49.071 --> 01:54:49.850
violence.

1926
01:54:49.850 --> 01:54:54.680
You just have to look at what Muslims are doing to other Muslims in context that

1927
01:54:54.681 --> 01:54:59.681
have absolutely nothing to do with our overreaching are colonialism are stealing

1928
01:55:00.261 --> 01:55:03.410
of resources.
You can,
you can make us as bad as you want,

1929
01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:07.700
but go to Pakistan and ask yourself,
why are they,

1930
01:55:07.701 --> 01:55:10.790
why are Sunni's billowing up?

1931
01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.770
She a or a mosques,
eh,

1932
01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:18.050
but some guy is willing to lay down his life tomorrow morning and you know,

1933
01:55:18.051 --> 01:55:21.170
become a bomb and kill 75 people.
Um,

1934
01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:26.580
and it's got nothing to do with us.
It's got that is,
and it's,
we can,

1935
01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:31.490
we call it politics.
It's,
we're talking about in many cases,

1936
01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:36.200
the victimization of a religious minority that has no political power.
It's not,

1937
01:55:36.201 --> 01:55:40.190
it's not politics by,
it's not like this,
these,
it's not the tea party.
You know,

1938
01:55:40.191 --> 01:55:44.190
really trying to get something.
This is,
this is,
uh,
this is someone waking up,

1939
01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:48.750
willing to die for the pleasure of killing men,

1940
01:55:48.751 --> 01:55:51.150
women and children.
Um,
uh,

1941
01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:55.680
and it's to no end apart from the imagined end that he's going to wind up in

1942
01:55:55.681 --> 01:55:59.460
paradise and get everyone he loves in there after they die.

1943
01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:03.210
Do you think that it's possible to turn that around?

1944
01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:08.700
Is there a way or do you think that the reason why you support the United States

1945
01:56:08.730 --> 01:56:12.480
occupying these countries is because they're so chaotic that you need to keep an

1946
01:56:12.481 --> 01:56:16.140
eye on them?
You need to keep the area settled,
but I actually don't,

1947
01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:21.150
I don't support,
uh,
occupation anywhere.
Actually.
I,
I,

1948
01:56:22.170 --> 01:56:26.640
I never,
I,
I supported are going into Afghanistan because we had to do it.

1949
01:56:26.641 --> 01:56:30.930
We had to had to strike a blow against al Qaeda.
And did we have to yeah,
no,

1950
01:56:30.990 --> 01:56:33.180
we had to.
What is the main,
well,

1951
01:56:33.181 --> 01:56:37.560
because what we look at the consequences of our never having done it before
that,

1952
01:56:37.690 --> 01:56:40.950
I mean,
we were,
there was this slow bleed of,
of,

1953
01:56:41.210 --> 01:56:45.900
of attacks on us without any real reprisal for decades.
I mean,
so,
you know,

1954
01:56:45.901 --> 01:56:50.740
since the early eighties,
um,
and,
uh,

1955
01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:54.700
we were,
you know,
the hostages in Lebanon and there were,
there were,
you know,
uh,

1956
01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:58.350
the marine barracks got got blown up and,
and the,

1957
01:56:58.800 --> 01:56:59.820
the,

1958
01:57:00.270 --> 01:57:04.890
the lesson drawn among the jihadis of the world was,
this is,

1959
01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:08.340
you know,
the West is a paper tiger,
America's a paper tiger.

1960
01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:12.820
They're just going to run away and we can keep taking it to them.
And um,

1961
01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:15.400
that is a,
um,

1962
01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:19.460
that's not the lesson we want jihadis to draw.
Uh,
I,

1963
01:57:19.461 --> 01:57:24.461
I think the lesson we want them to draw is that it is very dangerous to be a

1964
01:57:25.081 --> 01:57:27.060
jihadist.
And you know,
if you,

1965
01:57:27.061 --> 01:57:29.910
if you are desperate to get to paradise and you're going to tell all your

1966
01:57:29.911 --> 01:57:34.300
friends and neighbors in your,
in your suicide video that,
um,

1967
01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:38.310
you want to get to paradise,
uh,
we'll help you get to paradise.
I mean,

1968
01:57:38.340 --> 01:57:41.190
I think we have to have a policy towards,
towards the hottest,
uh,

1969
01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:44.850
which is a policy of,
of,
of hot war.

1970
01:57:44.910 --> 01:57:48.060
But I don't think we should be occupied countries to do this.
I think,

1971
01:57:48.061 --> 01:57:50.730
I think it should be largely covert.

1972
01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:54.210
Well then how are we going to control the heroin?
How do I control the heroin?

1973
01:57:54.210 --> 01:57:55.710
Then?
What do you mean don't occupy?

1974
01:57:55.770 --> 01:57:58.730
How are we going to be able to could've locked down and all that Afghany sweet

1975
01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:02.850
heroin.
Uh,
I thought,
well,
we can just,
we can just buy it if we want it.

1976
01:58:03.190 --> 01:58:06.720
It's for sale that's going on.
Did you think that uh,
the United States,

1977
01:58:06.721 --> 01:58:10.050
like some secret factions in the United States have some sort of a and an

1978
01:58:10.051 --> 01:58:14.830
involvement in profiteering off of a drug use?
I have no idea.
I mean,
I've,

1979
01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:17.760
you seen it,
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Yeah,
no,
I mean it's,
it's,
it's totally,

1980
01:58:17.850 --> 01:58:21.780
it's possible.
I've,
it's not something I've thought about.
It just,

1981
01:58:21.781 --> 01:58:24.960
it seems like most things are for sale.
I mean,

1982
01:58:24.961 --> 01:58:29.370
certainly heroin is for sale if it's not,
and it's like,
what is the margin of,
of,

1983
01:58:29.450 --> 01:58:33.420
you know,
for stealing it and fighting a war to steal at me?
Clearly,
whatever.

1984
01:58:33.630 --> 01:58:38.280
If we had ulterior profit seeking motives in any of these wars,

1985
01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:41.410
uh,
they didn't turn out.
They didn't out.

1986
01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:44.680
I mean these wars are so much more costly than anything else we could have

1987
01:58:44.681 --> 01:58:48.140
gotten from them.
Um,
but the,
uh,

1988
01:58:48.970 --> 01:58:53.380
I think the
lesson I draw from these wars is that we,

1989
01:58:53.381 --> 01:58:56.230
there is a consequence to having boots on the ground.
Uh,
and it's,
uh,

1990
01:58:56.290 --> 01:59:01.150
it's a bad one.
A,
which is,
there's this perception that we,

1991
01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:06.360
based on our own desire for conflict and conquest are at war with the Muslim

1992
01:59:06.911 --> 01:59:09.730
world.
There's a perception,
there's a perception in the Muslim world,

1993
01:59:09.731 --> 01:59:14.000
some of it is,
is,
is fraudulent.
And they don't really believe that some of it is,

1994
01:59:14.030 --> 01:59:16.270
is genuinely believed by many,

1995
01:59:16.271 --> 01:59:21.271
many millions of people that the west is just trying to conquer the Muslim world

1996
01:59:22.030 --> 01:59:26.330
and destroy this,
this,
the one true religion.
Uh,

1997
01:59:26.770 --> 01:59:31.240
that's not a perception that we can just keep humming for a century.

1998
01:59:31.241 --> 01:59:33.150
We have to deflate that.
And so,
and,

1999
01:59:33.151 --> 01:59:37.930
and one way to deflate it is to treat this all like a,

2000
01:59:37.931 --> 01:59:42.070
um,
and sometimes like a,
like a crime problem.
Uh,

2001
01:59:42.210 --> 01:59:44.560
but a crime problem that is going to be

2002
01:59:46.450 --> 01:59:48.370
remedied with covert

2003
01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:53.260
covert acts of violence.
So,
you know,
I think,

2004
01:59:53.261 --> 01:59:57.490
I think we should assassinate jihadist that's,
and,
and we shouldn't,

2005
01:59:57.580 --> 02:00:00.670
we shouldn't make a big thing about doing this.
We shouldn't own it.

2006
02:00:00.671 --> 02:00:01.570
Every time it happens,

2007
02:00:01.571 --> 02:00:06.571
it just should become clear in a hundred countries that if you're a jihadist who

2008
02:00:08.170 --> 02:00:10.690
opens open sets up shop as,
you know,

2009
02:00:10.691 --> 02:00:13.950
the jihad is now going to install the,

2010
02:00:13.951 --> 02:00:17.070
the global caliphate and kill infidels.
Um,

2011
02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:21.980
your life just got very dangerous.
Um,
and,
and,
but the,

2012
02:00:21.981 --> 02:00:26.160
the end game for us and for,
for a global,
uh,

2013
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:31.550
civil civilization is to get moderate Muslims to do that job.
I mean,

2014
02:00:31.570 --> 02:00:36.570
say the moderate Muslims have to realize that they need to win a civil war with

2015
02:00:37.571 --> 02:00:40.990
their jihadists as long as moderate Muslims and,

2016
02:00:41.050 --> 02:00:46.050
and conservative Muslims who are not jihadis think that jihadism is not their

2017
02:00:47.501 --> 02:00:51.310
problem or,
or has no or,
or they're just scared of,

2018
02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:56.350
of their own extremists.
Um,
there's going to be no one else to,

2019
02:00:56.410 --> 02:00:58.600
to,
to prosecute this war.

2020
02:00:58.630 --> 02:01:03.100
And there's something intrinsically inflammatory about us doing this job.

2021
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:08.140
Not only in the minds of geodes,
but in the minds of,
of,
uh,
normal Muslims.

2022
02:01:08.141 --> 02:01:12.200
Who would never think of waging jihad,
but they just find it,
uh,
uh,

2023
02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:17.560
intolerable to see western,
to get,
you know,
guys sitting in,

2024
02:01:17.561 --> 02:01:22.420
in office parks in Vegas,
flying drones over Pakistan,

2025
02:01:22.630 --> 02:01:26.710
which are pretty precise and their kill a lot of bad people,

2026
02:01:26.711 --> 02:01:31.150
but they also kill some,
some innocent bystanders.
That is,

2027
02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:33.580
you don't have to be a,

2028
02:01:33.610 --> 02:01:36.760
someone who was going to be a jihadist to find that objectionable.

2029
02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:40.430
If you are a devout Muslim who just feels you're a person with conscious.
No,
but,

2030
02:01:40.431 --> 02:01:41.900
but,
but,
but there's this,

2031
02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:46.530
there's a salt religious solidarity that is working against us,
um,

2032
02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:49.850
which the only remedy for which I think is to have

2033
02:01:51.530 --> 02:01:56.530
moderate Muslims wherever they can be found to rise up and own this thing,

2034
02:01:57.020 --> 02:01:57.910
which I mean,
uh,

2035
02:01:57.960 --> 02:02:02.960
until until moderate Muslims find I'll Qaeda and the Taliban every bit is

2036
02:02:04.971 --> 02:02:08.090
inimicable inimical to their,
you know,

2037
02:02:08.190 --> 02:02:13.160
their hopes for this world as we do.
Um,
you know,
it's going to,

2038
02:02:13.161 --> 02:02:15.710
it's an untenable situation.
We can't keep doing this.

2039
02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:18.830
I want to go back to what you said about the war being so expensive in the first

2040
02:02:18.831 --> 02:02:22.070
place,
that it wouldn't be a war for selling drugs for profit.

2041
02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:27.080
I'm not saying that it's entirely for involved or it's based on selling drugs

2042
02:02:27.201 --> 02:02:27.890
for profit,

2043
02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:31.310
but there's no denying that the heroin production has increased radical since

2044
02:02:31.311 --> 02:02:35.570
NATO.
Op,
excuse me,
I have a cold ladies and gentlemen.
No,

2045
02:02:35.571 --> 02:02:38.960
if you could tell NATO occupation,
I mean there's an article here,

2046
02:02:38.961 --> 02:02:43.820
it says it's a 40 times higher production of heroin since NATO are occupied.

2047
02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:47.840
But all part of that could be,
again,
this is not something I know anything about,

2048
02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:52.340
but the,
the,
um,
there are other,
clearly there are other explanations for that.

2049
02:02:52.341 --> 02:02:55.160
One is just that you,
you have people

2050
02:02:56.660 --> 02:03:00.770
who have no other livelihood but to grow crops and the most valuable crop they

2051
02:03:00.771 --> 02:03:04.250
can grow is heroin.
That's true.
And that's so,
so what are they going to do?

2052
02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:08.720
It's like they're,
they're just coming out of the civil war obviously isn't over,

2053
02:03:08.721 --> 02:03:13.700
but they came out of a period of,
of,
of just wall to wall violence.

2054
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:18.950
Uh,
and we just,
we,
we'd dump billions and billions of dollars in there.
We,
we,

2055
02:03:18.970 --> 02:03:22.540
we pave a few roads and now,
you know,

2056
02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:27.240
if you're an Afghan Afghany farmer,
what are you going to grow?
Um,
I,
you know,

2057
02:03:27.930 --> 02:03:31.460
it seems like it,
that would be the right,
the right choice if you're,

2058
02:03:31.490 --> 02:03:35.000
if you're someone we would get the buyer is on our side.
That's the problem.

2059
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.271
Right?

2060
02:03:35.271 --> 02:03:38.210
But isn't it also the problem when they have United States army troops guarding

2061
02:03:38.211 --> 02:03:41.570
poppy fields?
There's video of it.
Geraldo Rivera interviewing.

2062
02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:44.810
I mean it's clearly that there's some military involvement.

2063
02:03:45.020 --> 02:03:48.380
The United States military involved in the,
the heroin production in Afghanistan.

2064
02:03:48.381 --> 02:03:49.790
It's like,
it's pretty transparent.

2065
02:03:50.150 --> 02:03:53.210
And the idea is that they're saying that the reason why they do it is because

2066
02:03:53.211 --> 02:03:56.660
they need to do to help these people grow their crops so that they'll ride on

2067
02:03:56.661 --> 02:04:00.320
the Taliban.
Yeah.
Well,
which is a perfectly reasonable explanation for me.

2068
02:04:00.321 --> 02:04:04.700
It says,
so you just tell me that there,
there are marines,
Guardian,
a poppy field.

2069
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:08.030
There are many interpretations of that,
but one is just what you gave.

2070
02:04:08.031 --> 02:04:09.470
They have to win hearts and minds.

2071
02:04:09.471 --> 02:04:14.471
They have to figure out some way to get the non radicalized people to rat out

2072
02:04:14.810 --> 02:04:19.760
the very scary radicalized people who make come to kill them.
Um,

2073
02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:20.713
uh,

2074
02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:25.130
and how are we going to the item number one in,

2075
02:04:25.131 --> 02:04:29.780
in engineering that cooperation can't be let's force all of these people to

2076
02:04:29.781 --> 02:04:34.370
destroy the most profitable crop.
They,
they,
they could grow.

2077
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:38.220
Um,
because of our drug laws.
That's interesting way of looking

2078
02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:38.521
<v 2>at it.</v>

2079
02:04:38.521 --> 02:04:42.270
The unfortunate thing for me though is that there's a ton of evidence that the

2080
02:04:42.271 --> 02:04:44.370
United States government has been involved in drug smuggling.

2081
02:04:44.490 --> 02:04:48.690
There was a CIA jet that had been to Guantanamo Bay twice.

2082
02:04:48.691 --> 02:04:52.200
It crashed with several tons of cocaine and Mexico pull that up.

2083
02:04:52.201 --> 02:04:53.760
It's kind of hilarious.
It's a,

2084
02:04:54.090 --> 02:04:57.510
he see this jet and inside of it it's just stacked with cocaine.

2085
02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:00.930
I think obviously this is probably not the entire organization,

2086
02:05:00.931 --> 02:05:04.140
but there's some factions that are profiting off of it.
They have forever.

2087
02:05:04.141 --> 02:05:08.280
There's a guy named Barry seal who was involved in back during the Pablo Escobar

2088
02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:11.520
days.
He was,
according to him,
he was selling drugs for the CIA.

2089
02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:14.460
There's also what happened with a freeway,

2090
02:05:14.461 --> 02:05:17.820
Ricky and the whole Oliver North contras in Nicaragua situation,

2091
02:05:17.970 --> 02:05:20.370
the United States was clearly involved in drug trafficking,

2092
02:05:20.430 --> 02:05:23.700
trafficking to promote uh,
a hidden war.

2093
02:05:23.790 --> 02:05:28.560
This is the plane crashed with several tons of cocaine.
Cocaine.
That's hilarious.

2094
02:05:28.890 --> 02:05:31.740
And it's a,
that's a jet that had been to Guantanamo Bay twice.

2095
02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:34.830
I mean I don't want to go too far down the conspiracy theory,

2096
02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:35.880
a rabbit hole with you,

2097
02:05:35.881 --> 02:05:40.050
but you have to take that into consideration that there's a lot of evidence that

2098
02:05:40.051 --> 02:05:43.290
some fuckery is a foot and has been for a long time.

2099
02:05:43.291 --> 02:05:44.910
Whether it was in Southeast Asia,

2100
02:05:44.940 --> 02:05:49.940
heroin in the Vietnam war or whether it's this right now there's something,

2101
02:05:50.070 --> 02:05:53.310
and when you say that it costs so much money anyway,

2102
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:56.200
but to who it doesn't cost so much money to Halliburton,

2103
02:05:56.201 --> 02:05:59.040
it doesn't cost so much money until these come companies that are profiting off

2104
02:05:59.041 --> 02:06:02.110
of war.
The,
that's the idea is that war is,

2105
02:06:02.550 --> 02:06:06.480
is very profitable for the people who get the government contracts and go over

2106
02:06:06.481 --> 02:06:07.140
there and,

2107
02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:11.910
and build airplane hangars and all these different things that they're doing

2108
02:06:11.911 --> 02:06:16.380
over there.
It's not,
we're not talking about what's profitable or not profitable,

2109
02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:18.060
profitable for the United States taxpayer.

2110
02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:20.850
We're talking about the people that are actually controlling the game in the

2111
02:06:20.851 --> 02:06:24.160
first place.
Yeah.
With that.
But that's the,
that's the issue.

2112
02:06:24.161 --> 02:06:29.161
They is there someone controlling the game and are their interests aligned

2113
02:06:29.341 --> 02:06:31.680
enough so that they really have control over it.
So,

2114
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:33.960
and that I think is in most cases,

2115
02:06:33.961 --> 02:06:38.961
I'm not saying that people never conspire or that it's not possible to have a

2116
02:06:39.241 --> 02:06:42.090
sufficient number of,
of people in power who,

2117
02:06:42.110 --> 02:06:47.110
who have selfish and shortsighted interest that can get them to do terrible

2118
02:06:48.691 --> 02:06:53.040
things in the world stage.
And that clearly could happen,
at least in principle.

2119
02:06:53.041 --> 02:06:56.070
But for the most part,
there's just,

2120
02:06:56.071 --> 02:06:58.320
people's interests are not aligned all that well.
There's not,

2121
02:06:58.321 --> 02:07:03.321
Halliburton is not that powerful so that it could decide to launch a war.

2122
02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:05.070
And so,
and,
and,
and w I mean,

2123
02:07:05.071 --> 02:07:08.100
one way you can see this one thing I would get you to,

2124
02:07:08.300 --> 02:07:11.320
to reflect on is it takes someone like,
like,
um,

2125
02:07:11.970 --> 02:07:16.740
President Obama when he was Senator Obama,
he was against the Iraq war.

2126
02:07:16.741 --> 02:07:20.950
He was allegedly,
yeah,
but he spoke on this and he's a critic.

2127
02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:22.580
You certainly ratings nothing if you,

2128
02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:25.880
if you base it on what he's told us since he's got an office and what turns up

2129
02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:27.570
until true.
Yeah.
But I'm asking,

2130
02:07:27.571 --> 02:07:31.170
I'm asking how you account for that transformation in him.
So he's,

2131
02:07:31.230 --> 02:07:36.010
he's someone who was a critic of the former.
If

2132
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:39.130
<v 0>you had,
before he was elected,
if you had asked him,</v>

2133
02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:41.830
what do you think about Bush and what do you think about Chanie and what you

2134
02:07:41.831 --> 02:07:45.340
think about Rumsfeld and what all the stuff they did,
war profiteers,
he would,

2135
02:07:45.370 --> 02:07:49.900
he would have a,
uh,
uh,
and,
and it's all of this came,
I'm not just speculating,

2136
02:07:49.901 --> 02:07:51.910
he said many of these things,
but he had a,

2137
02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:55.540
a very clear critique based on,

2138
02:07:55.990 --> 02:07:59.680
on liberal principles that,
that almost any liberal who was,

2139
02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:04.740
was enthusiastic about his election would recognize that this was the Iraq war

2140
02:08:06.011 --> 02:08:09.700
was unnecessary.
We were,
we went in there on false pretenses.

2141
02:08:09.730 --> 02:08:12.780
This was a terrible idea.
The consequences,
the Ma,
you know,

2142
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:17.290
now there's a mess that has to be cleaned up.
But now he's become a,

2143
02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:22.090
to the eyes of many liberals,
just a neo-con shill,
someone who's,

2144
02:08:22.091 --> 02:08:22.924
who's,
you know,

2145
02:08:24.070 --> 02:08:29.070
more secretive and more agile and his prosecution of a covert war than Bush and

2146
02:08:30.671 --> 02:08:34.720
Cheney ever wore.
Um,
and what,
so what do you,

2147
02:08:34.750 --> 02:08:38.980
how do you explain that transformation?
Is He someone who,
uh,

2148
02:08:39.370 --> 02:08:41.680
was always that way and was just line,
but,

2149
02:08:41.681 --> 02:08:46.260
but line for some reason that doesn't make much political sense.
Um,

2150
02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:49.240
or was he,
uh,
is,

2151
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:54.270
is there some nefarious process where some star chamber where the really the

2152
02:08:54.731 --> 02:08:57.710
people who are really empowered got to him and scared him.
And like he's,

2153
02:08:57.720 --> 02:08:58.660
he's pressing the United States,

2154
02:08:58.661 --> 02:09:02.530
but he had a meeting with Halliburton and a bunch of powerful guys,

2155
02:09:02.770 --> 02:09:05.530
some billionaires,
uh,
who,
who,

2156
02:09:05.590 --> 02:09:10.000
who scared him straight and now he's just doing their bidding or don't believe

2157
02:09:10.001 --> 02:09:13.360
that's possible.
Yeah,
I have no,
I don't think,
I think that's,
no,

2158
02:09:13.361 --> 02:09:17.930
I don't think that's possible.
But,
uh,
or,
and this is the,
the,
um,

2159
02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:19.353
uh,

2160
02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:24.720
obviously the interpretation I favor or are the facts of the world so scary and

2161
02:09:27.401 --> 02:09:32.401
is governance so messy and is it so fucking hard to get anything done that this,

2162
02:09:36.100 --> 02:09:40.010
this process of apparent transformation just happens?
You know,
so,
so he gets,

2163
02:09:40.030 --> 02:09:44.260
so he got an office,
he's a senator who's not really privy to all the facts.

2164
02:09:44.710 --> 02:09:49.450
Now he's president who every morning wakes up and is told the scariest

2165
02:09:49.451 --> 02:09:53.620
intelligence we've got.
Um,
what does that do to you and how,

2166
02:09:53.621 --> 02:09:58.260
how eager does that make you to,
uh,
make sure that a,

2167
02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:03.440
a terrorist incident of an order of magnitude larger than September 11th,

2168
02:10:03.621 --> 02:10:05.740
it doesn't happen on your watch?
I mean,

2169
02:10:05.950 --> 02:10:10.950
imagine having the responsibility to protect whole cities from massive acts of

2170
02:10:11.351 --> 02:10:13.940
terror.
Just how,
just how,

2171
02:10:14.110 --> 02:10:18.440
how squeamish are you going to be about bugging people cell phones?
Um,

2172
02:10:18.490 --> 02:10:18.981
I think it's,

2173
02:10:18.981 --> 02:10:23.981
it's very easy to see that through no evil hand behind the scenes.

2174
02:10:24.101 --> 02:10:28.400
You could have somebody like Obama who was a genuine liberal,
you know,
I mean,

2175
02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:32.380
he's not,
he's not as far left as,
as many people want them to be,

2176
02:10:32.381 --> 02:10:36.700
but there's no reason to doubt that he objected to the Iraq war and,
and,
uh,
uh,

2177
02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:38.390
he is basically,
um,
uh,

2178
02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:42.800
a straight down the middle of the fairway liberal who's now essentially

2179
02:10:42.801 --> 02:10:44.480
functioning like a neo con,
I think.

2180
02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:48.830
I think the details have to be terrifying and I think it's,
I think it's just,
uh,

2181
02:10:48.890 --> 02:10:52.900
it's an immense responsibility.
I don't think it's either or.
I think a

2182
02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:56.250
<v 1>possible,
excuse me.
It's very possible that both things are going on.</v>

2183
02:10:56.550 --> 02:11:00.540
It's very possible that there are people that are absolutely profiting and want

2184
02:11:00.541 --> 02:11:02.550
to get involved in wars for profit.

2185
02:11:02.940 --> 02:11:06.120
And I think also the world is scary and I think it's easy to cut.

2186
02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:07.610
<v 0>No,
but I don't think a guy like Obama,</v>

2187
02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:12.760
I don't doubt that Halliburton sees an upside to a war because they make all

2188
02:11:13.551 --> 02:11:16.070
this stuff and they provide the services.
So yeah,

2189
02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:20.060
it's part of the next war is,
is part of their business plan.

2190
02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:24.680
But the question is how much power does any one person have for every

2191
02:11:24.681 --> 02:11:25.371
billionaire?

2192
02:11:25.371 --> 02:11:30.371
Like the head of the Koch brothers who Hoosiers twirling his mustache and uh,

2193
02:11:30.650 --> 02:11:33.800
doing the nefarious right wing thing.

2194
02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:37.040
There are billionaires who do not align with,

2195
02:11:37.070 --> 02:11:40.640
with them politically who can do the left wing thing.

2196
02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:43.670
<v 1>Right.
But that's just a,
that's a microcosm of human beings in general.</v>

2197
02:11:43.671 --> 02:11:45.560
There's evil people and there's nice people.
That's just that,

2198
02:11:45.570 --> 02:11:48.320
that doesn't necessarily preclude the idea that someone,

2199
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:52.100
not just profits off war but engineer's war for profit it seems.

2200
02:11:52.101 --> 02:11:54.410
If you're talking about something like billions and billions of dollars and you

2201
02:11:54.411 --> 02:11:57.170
can justify to yourself this inevitable anyway because these people are cave

2202
02:11:57.171 --> 02:11:59.000
people,
they're going to fuck up and you got all these,

2203
02:11:59.180 --> 02:12:01.310
look what they do to women and look what they do to their,
their people.

2204
02:12:01.311 --> 02:12:04.270
Look they do to each other.
Look what they do to fellow Muslims.
You're all,

2205
02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:08.570
you're also maybe not making the best humanitarian choices because you're making

2206
02:12:08.571 --> 02:12:13.370
choices based on profit and the profit is absolutely enormous.

2207
02:12:13.371 --> 02:12:13.760
I mean it's,

2208
02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:17.060
it's massive and there's pretty clear evidence that the United States basically

2209
02:12:17.061 --> 02:12:19.010
lied to get into the Iraq war.
I mean,

2210
02:12:19.011 --> 02:12:21.740
I know that there was a lot of people that genuinely believe that there was

2211
02:12:21.741 --> 02:12:25.040
something going on in Iraq and genuinely believed that Saddam Hussein was a

2212
02:12:25.041 --> 02:12:28.040
threat.
But there's also people that believe it was a whole lot of fuckery,

2213
02:12:28.041 --> 02:12:29.450
including Poland.
Colin Powell,

2214
02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:34.230
<v 0>well,
well,
everyone believed when,
when Colin Powell deliver that,</v>

2215
02:12:34.410 --> 02:12:38.710
that presentation at the UN,
virtually everyone bill with,

2216
02:12:38.740 --> 02:12:43.610
with a few exceptions,
virtually everyone believed that that was true.
No,
it was,

2217
02:12:43.611 --> 02:12:46.920
it was not.
It was uncontroversial that the,
the,
the premise that,

2218
02:12:47.490 --> 02:12:52.490
that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction was uncontroversial and all

2219
02:12:52.651 --> 02:12:57.651
the people who were against are going in there were against it for reasons that

2220
02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.760
did not entail doubting whether there were weapons of mass destruction.
They,

2221
02:13:02.761 --> 02:13:05.430
there were other reasons not to go in there.
It's just,
it was kind of a,

2222
02:13:05.690 --> 02:13:09.210
it was a hornet's nest.
It was to,
it was a quagmire.
It was,
it was,
you know,

2223
02:13:09.390 --> 02:13:12.690
what specifically are the weapons of mass destruction and that would motivate us

2224
02:13:12.691 --> 02:13:16.350
going there and not going into North Korea.
Oh,
right.
So it's,
well,

2225
02:13:16.351 --> 02:13:20.090
because of the ams,
no money in North Korea.
Well know there's that,
but no,

2226
02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:22.290
because he didn't,
he didn't have nukes.

2227
02:13:22.350 --> 02:13:24.930
He was trying to get news or we thought he was trying to get news.
I mean,

2228
02:13:24.931 --> 02:13:28.080
so we could deal with a chemical weapons attack and he'd give everyone a gas

2229
02:13:28.081 --> 02:13:31.860
mask and a hazmat suit and we can still a war.

2230
02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:35.850
<v 2>Uh,
the,
the,
the nukes changed the game.
And that's why,</v>

2231
02:13:35.851 --> 02:13:37.680
that's one reason why Pakistan is so terrifying.

2232
02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:41.760
So you don't open yourself up to the possibility of conspiracy?
No,
I do.

2233
02:13:41.761 --> 02:13:45.240
I just know that,
that this is an adage,
I don't know where it comes from,

2234
02:13:45.241 --> 02:13:47.040
but never ascribed a conspiracy.

2235
02:13:47.041 --> 02:13:51.330
What can be explained by incompetence or the tragedy of wasted opportunity.

2236
02:13:51.331 --> 02:13:55.680
The idea that just because a tragedy gets capitalized on doesn't mean that the

2237
02:13:55.681 --> 02:13:57.660
people who capitalize on it cause the tragedy,

2238
02:13:57.900 --> 02:14:01.070
but that's a standard operational procedure for warriors to,

2239
02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:04.290
to find something wrong and say,
look,
this is what happened.
We got attacked.

2240
02:14:04.291 --> 02:14:06.060
We're going into Iraq.
Right,
right.
Yeah.

2241
02:14:06.061 --> 02:14:09.810
I see in every conspiracy,
and again,

2242
02:14:09.811 --> 02:14:12.990
I'm not doubting whether anyone ever conspires.
I,

2243
02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:17.700
it's just that there are so many constraints on people doing what they want,

2244
02:14:17.701 --> 02:14:21.160
especially when they're nefarious things.
Um,

2245
02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:26.400
the constraints largely being everyone else's opposing wants,
um,
that,

2246
02:14:26.910 --> 02:14:31.410
uh,
it's,
it's hard for people to,
uh,

2247
02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:33.930
bring these,
these big plans off.

2248
02:14:34.020 --> 02:14:37.470
But isn't that your argument for eavesdropping on people in the first place that

2249
02:14:37.471 --> 02:14:40.350
they're planning big plans?
Somebody said this,
I forget who it was.

2250
02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:43.500
I think somebody said it,
but it's a different scale of conspiracy.

2251
02:14:43.501 --> 02:14:45.330
I mean it's so,
you look at the 19 hijackers,

2252
02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:48.900
it's just 19 guys with box cutters and somebody.
It's a big organization.

2253
02:14:48.901 --> 02:14:52.020
I mean that's not just 19 guys.
Those guys planned it out.
They had help.

2254
02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:55.080
They learned how to fly.
They pulled it off.
Someone said,

2255
02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:57.780
this is not launching a war.
It's not,
it's not,
you know,

2256
02:14:57.930 --> 02:15:02.170
half a million guys and tank.
Right,
because it's 19 guys and not Haliburton,

2257
02:15:02.270 --> 02:15:05.820
not a multibillion dollar operation that the CEO,

2258
02:15:05.821 --> 02:15:09.180
the former CEO just happens to be the vice president of the United States and

2259
02:15:09.181 --> 02:15:13.560
gets multibillion dollar,
no bid contracts to go and rebuild shit.
We blow up.

2260
02:15:13.561 --> 02:15:14.130
I mean it's,

2261
02:15:14.130 --> 02:15:18.420
it's pretty connect the dots if you want it to argue for a war for profit.

2262
02:15:18.660 --> 02:15:22.440
That's about as cut and dry as it ever gets.
Someone said on the podcast,

2263
02:15:22.441 --> 02:15:26.250
I forgot who it was,
I don't know who it was.
Maybe I read it online.
Someone said,

2264
02:15:26.251 --> 02:15:29.430
do you believe in nine 11 we ask people if they believe in conspiracies,

2265
02:15:29.431 --> 02:15:31.410
do you believe in nine 11 and I'm like,
what?
What do you mean?

2266
02:15:31.411 --> 02:15:34.500
Does d believe nine 11 was done as experienced by the government?
No.

2267
02:15:34.501 --> 02:15:37.140
Do you believe it happened?
And everyone says yes.

2268
02:15:37.350 --> 02:15:40.050
Well then you believe in conspiracies cause there was a conspiracy.

2269
02:15:40.051 --> 02:15:43.200
Someone conspired to fly planes into buildings and whether or not the United

2270
02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:46.740
States government was involved or whether or not it was these 19 guys from Saudi

2271
02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:49.260
Arabia that was,
they pulled that off.
Conspiracies exist.

2272
02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:54.500
But something like 35% of Americans believe that the u s had some hand in that

2273
02:15:56.040 --> 02:15:56.761
conspiracy.

2274
02:15:56.761 --> 02:16:01.530
Is it really that high that we let it happen and 16% think that we engineered
it.

2275
02:16:01.650 --> 02:16:05.280
I hate those things though,
that we demoed the buildings,

2276
02:16:05.281 --> 02:16:08.700
it's someone in the dead of night had to fill the twin towers with,

2277
02:16:08.910 --> 02:16:11.910
with thermite and that we hit,
you know,

2278
02:16:11.911 --> 02:16:15.720
we hit the plunger at the right moment just just after that the planes went in

2279
02:16:15.930 --> 02:16:17.160
or maybe they weren't even planes,

2280
02:16:17.161 --> 02:16:20.520
maybe there were holograms and w once you get deep into this,

2281
02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:22.980
the nine 11 conspiracy,
you get,

2282
02:16:23.370 --> 02:16:27.960
you know the CIA faking voices of all the passengers on the flights.

2283
02:16:27.970 --> 02:16:30.340
It's the,
the answering

2284
02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:33.940
<v 0>machine messages of,
of the relatives of the dead passengers,</v>

2285
02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:38.740
blight by CIA for voice faking technology.
And it's just,
it's just,

2286
02:16:39.250 --> 02:16:42.580
it's completely insane.
And,
and,
and the,
the problem with it is,

2287
02:16:42.581 --> 02:16:46.570
is it's totally unconstrained by any,
um,

2288
02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:52.080
overall explanation or plausible hypothesis about what could have happened.

2289
02:16:52.151 --> 02:16:55.450
What it is,
is you,
you look at every anomaly.
I mean,
any,

2290
02:16:55.451 --> 02:16:58.300
any event you could possibly describe,

2291
02:16:58.690 --> 02:17:03.430
it's going to have a million coil.
What looked like coincidences in it,

2292
02:17:03.850 --> 02:17:06.670
uh,
and which,
which if you,

2293
02:17:06.671 --> 02:17:09.790
if you tried to engineer beforehand,

2294
02:17:09.970 --> 02:17:14.530
would seem like the odds against them more astronomical.
But in the aftermath,

2295
02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:15.580
something had to happen.

2296
02:17:15.581 --> 02:17:20.230
So it's like the people sold stock and American Airlines that day.
Right?

2297
02:17:20.260 --> 02:17:25.260
So how is it that you sold your stock and American Airlines the very day of the

2298
02:17:26.140 --> 02:17:30.360
day before,
uh,
an Air American Airlines jet flew into a building,
right?

2299
02:17:30.610 --> 02:17:33.200
How did you know that is,
that's fishy,
right?

2300
02:17:33.250 --> 02:17:35.920
The real problem is you find out that people buy and sell those stocks every,

2301
02:17:35.921 --> 02:17:40.420
yeah.
So,
but so there,
there are uncountable number of things like that,

2302
02:17:40.421 --> 02:17:44.190
but if you're only looking for anomalies,
anomalies,
and you're,
and,

2303
02:17:44.191 --> 02:17:48.820
and you're not constrained by,
by any overall thesis,

2304
02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:52.000
uh,
you can find them in any situation.
And,

2305
02:17:52.001 --> 02:17:55.180
but let me just be honest about what this picture of reality actually is.

2306
02:17:55.181 --> 02:18:00.070
This is the,
the most diabolical plot in human history that,

2307
02:18:00.370 --> 02:18:04.930
that entailed thousands of conspiracists,
um,
uh,

2308
02:18:04.990 --> 02:18:07.870
or conspirators and,
and they,

2309
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:10.690
none of them have have crack.

2310
02:18:10.691 --> 02:18:14.560
No one has no one woke up feeling so guilty that they had to tell their story

2311
02:18:14.570 --> 02:18:16.270
and to 60 minutes.

2312
02:18:16.750 --> 02:18:21.750
And yet this whole thing was designed to leave George Bush reading my pet goat

2313
02:18:22.301 --> 02:18:25.100
at the moment that it all kicked off.
It's just not,
it's like,

2314
02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:29.080
it's this marriage of perfectly competent,

2315
02:18:29.170 --> 02:18:33.440
diabolical intelligence with the most inept.
I mean,
so,

2316
02:18:33.441 --> 02:18:38.440
so all these people conspired perfectly.
And yet the Arra,
the Iraq war was,

2317
02:18:38.441 --> 02:18:42.940
was launched as ineptly as you could possibly have been.
Well,

2318
02:18:42.941 --> 02:18:46.150
I certainly don't believe that the United States was involved and conspiring.
Uh,

2319
02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:50.440
I think there's some question that may be,
some people might have known about it.

2320
02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:53.830
The real issue comes when you find out about actual real false flags,

2321
02:18:54.220 --> 02:18:57.600
actual real false flag events that the United States is engineered that they've

2322
02:18:57.601 --> 02:18:59.650
pulled off,
that they haven't pulled off,
that they were planning,

2323
02:18:59.651 --> 02:19:02.950
that they didn't go through.
The real problem is that that's a genuine ideology.

2324
02:19:02.951 --> 02:19:06.610
That's a genuine thought process.
The idea of what we have to make this happen.

2325
02:19:06.700 --> 02:19:08.470
This is what we're going to do.
We're going to blow up a ship.

2326
02:19:08.500 --> 02:19:11.890
We're going to blow up a jet airliner and blame it on the Cubans and the

2327
02:19:11.891 --> 02:19:14.380
operations Northwoods.
Right.
Well,
but that's so,

2328
02:19:14.381 --> 02:19:19.381
so if you wanted to run a false flag operation and get us into a war with Iraq

2329
02:19:19.991 --> 02:19:22.920
under false pretenses.
So we,

2330
02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:27.400
we've got a no fly zone over a rack for years that we've been policing RF

2331
02:19:27.401 --> 02:19:28.234
sixteens

2332
02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:32.570
<v 2>you just shoot down one of our planes and then you tell the world that Iraq</v>

2333
02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:35.690
though,
we told them they couldn't shoot at us,
shot down one of our planes.

2334
02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:39.620
This is an act of war we're going in,
that would have been totally justifiable.

2335
02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:44.740
What you don't do is send mostly Saudis to come kill 3000 of the most connected

2336
02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:53.480
people.
Uh,
yeah,
we're in agreement and destroy our economy.
We're in agreement.

2337
02:19:53.481 --> 02:19:56.780
I don't think that the United States engineered it.
I say before,

2338
02:19:56.810 --> 02:19:59.780
so I know some people do and many,
many people do.
But you know what?

2339
02:19:59.781 --> 02:20:02.570
46% of Americans think the earth is less than 10,000 years old.

2340
02:20:02.571 --> 02:20:04.280
And the problem with those poles are,

2341
02:20:04.610 --> 02:20:07.670
those are a hundred percent idiots that answer the polls.

2342
02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:11.060
Who fucking answers polls?
I don't answer a poll.
Nobody had no answers.
Polls,

2343
02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:13.580
people call you up randomly in the middle of the day and ask you to answer a

2344
02:20:13.581 --> 02:20:14.780
poll.
Most likely you're busy.

2345
02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:17.930
Most likely you're going to hang up the amount of people that actually have an

2346
02:20:17.931 --> 02:20:21.770
answer.
Polls that did.
I don't think they represent the,
the,
the real,

2347
02:20:22.430 --> 02:20:24.970
the real population in the United States,
right?
Well,

2348
02:20:24.971 --> 02:20:28.880
when you say it's 13% 14% of the people that you polled,
right?

2349
02:20:28.881 --> 02:20:30.890
But there are ways of correcting for that.
So if for instance,

2350
02:20:30.891 --> 02:20:33.310
you could just pull college students,
you know,
you could,

2351
02:20:33.340 --> 02:20:38.340
you could literally be in a poly sci class and ask people who got into college

2352
02:20:38.631 --> 02:20:42.920
and are attending climb that.
That wouldn't be,
that would be an elite sample.
Uh,

2353
02:20:43.070 --> 02:20:47.540
but you get weird chore.
You get weird opinions even in among elite samples.
Well,

2354
02:20:47.541 --> 02:20:48.111
that number,

2355
02:20:48.111 --> 02:20:51.500
the 46% of Americans believe the earth is less than 10,000 years old.

2356
02:20:51.501 --> 02:20:56.450
That's a real one.
That's a gallop Jolla.
That alone throws poles like,
oh,

2357
02:20:56.451 --> 02:20:59.690
13% of the United States engineered nine 11.
Okay.

2358
02:20:59.840 --> 02:21:03.050
That's nothing compared to the idea that the earth is 10,000 years old.

2359
02:21:03.230 --> 02:21:06.230
The amount of evidence that the earth is more than 10,000 years old is

2360
02:21:06.270 --> 02:21:10.610
staggering.
And yet a way higher percentage believe in that.

2361
02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:14.140
They believe.
And that's because it's a religious doctrine of course.
And,

2362
02:21:14.141 --> 02:21:16.790
and that has been stable,
aren't they?
Religious isn't a,

2363
02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:20.870
isn't a belief in the government engineered nine 11 or isn't a million different

2364
02:21:20.871 --> 02:21:23.450
conspiracies?
Don't they have sort of a religious aspect to them?
The,

2365
02:21:23.451 --> 02:21:26.990
the pure belief,
the confirmation bias,
the ignoring anything contradictory.

2366
02:21:27.170 --> 02:21:31.370
People want to have an answer for sure.
Definitely.
Whether it's pro or con,

2367
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:35.120
there's that real thing that people want to wrap something up tight with a bow.

2368
02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:37.970
Either the government is full of evil criminals that are trying to kill your

2369
02:21:37.971 --> 02:21:41.330
baby or it's all just a part of life.

2370
02:21:41.331 --> 02:21:44.350
And the real issue was there's Boogie men out there.
Yeah,
yeah,
I know.

2371
02:21:44.351 --> 02:21:45.410
I think there is,

2372
02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:49.430
it hijacked some of the same features of the human mind or,

2373
02:21:49.431 --> 02:21:53.840
or have certain human minds because many people are very uncomfortable without

2374
02:21:54.170 --> 02:21:55.100
cognitive closure.

2375
02:21:55.101 --> 02:21:59.570
They're very not knowing why something happened is um,

2376
02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:04.370
d stabilizing to people to different degrees.
And um,

2377
02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:09.520
whereas one person can just feel no emotional cost to living with the mystery of

2378
02:22:11.091 --> 02:22:15.320
why something happened or freely admitting whether they have no idea.
Um,

2379
02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:17.750
or merely having a,
you know,
a hunch.

2380
02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:22.250
Other people crave certainty and,
and there are other features to it.

2381
02:22:22.251 --> 02:22:25.610
So people have an intuition that something huge

2382
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:29.610
<v 0>couldn't have been kicked off by something trivial,
you know?</v>

2383
02:22:29.611 --> 02:22:33.450
So if something huge happened,
if this thing is 3000 people dead and,
and,

2384
02:22:33.480 --> 02:22:38.370
and the biggest buildings coming down and,
and,
uh,
uh,
uh,

2385
02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:43.050
the world and chaos,
that couldn't have been just 19 guys with box cutters,

2386
02:22:43.290 --> 02:22:45.810
that had to be the cause,
had to be bigger.
And that,

2387
02:22:45.811 --> 02:22:50.010
that I think is an intuition that some people have more than others.
And it's a,

2388
02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:53.370
it's a faulty intuition,
but it's,
it's,
some people have a,

2389
02:22:54.080 --> 02:22:58.800
have certain schemas that through which they view human events,

2390
02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:03.580
which make conspiracy thinking,
uh,
very,
um,

2391
02:23:03.800 --> 02:23:05.710
attractors,
very plausible.
And Uca,

2392
02:23:05.730 --> 02:23:08.790
you'll notice that there's been actually research done on this,
that if you,

2393
02:23:08.791 --> 02:23:11.520
if you're someone who believes one conspiracy theory,

2394
02:23:11.850 --> 02:23:13.620
you're very likely to be someone who believes all of them.

2395
02:23:13.621 --> 02:23:16.560
And you're someone who's,
who's read the JFK books and you know,
who's read the,

2396
02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:21.450
the,
um,
uh,
uh,
you know,
the,
the Roswell incident.
I mean,
whether you're,
you're,

2397
02:23:21.451 --> 02:23:26.340
you're,
you're,
you're talking about extra terrestrials and,
and,
uh,
you know,

2398
02:23:26.430 --> 02:23:30.930
CIA,
uh,
uh,
misadventures in many places.

2399
02:23:31.470 --> 02:23:33.400
There's a whole esoteric literature out there that,

2400
02:23:33.450 --> 02:23:34.950
that I'm not so familiar with,

2401
02:23:34.951 --> 02:23:39.600
but I know that people who go down one rabbit hole tend to go down many of the

2402
02:23:39.601 --> 02:23:44.310
others.
And it's a kind of,
it's kind of a personal,
it's a personality type that,

2403
02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:48.690
um,
I think you can become,
you know,
I tried to,
uh,

2404
02:23:49.260 --> 02:23:51.790
it's actually,
it's,
it's interesting.
You,
you,
so you mentioned,
um,

2405
02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:55.200
why you asked me what I thought about the NSA thing and to some degree,
my,

2406
02:23:55.260 --> 02:23:56.400
my perception of this,

2407
02:23:56.650 --> 02:24:01.380
this news event has been polluted by my relationship with Glenn Greenwald,

2408
02:24:01.381 --> 02:24:04.680
who we don't like that guy.
No,
no.
I actually started,

2409
02:24:04.890 --> 02:24:06.960
it was interesting as I started out liking him,

2410
02:24:07.350 --> 02:24:09.150
not liking him and that I aligned with,

2411
02:24:09.151 --> 02:24:14.060
with all of his views or even many of his views,
but we had a,
a,

2412
02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:17.020
a brief,
uh,
personal,
uh,

2413
02:24:17.070 --> 02:24:21.240
exchange by email where he actually did me a favor,
which was,
which was great.

2414
02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:23.480
And it actually links up with this conspiracy thing.
Um,

2415
02:24:23.481 --> 02:24:26.310
so I have someone in my life who's,
who's,
who's very close to me,

2416
02:24:26.311 --> 02:24:30.570
who is a nine 11 conspiracy.
Very close to you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Member minds,

2417
02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:34.110
dad or something.
A member of my family who is a,
who is a,
uh,

2418
02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:37.170
and a very bright guy who is a nine 11 conspiracy guy.

2419
02:24:37.171 --> 02:24:40.190
And so I fought with him about this for now,
for a years.

2420
02:24:40.230 --> 02:24:44.310
So like every six months just,
it,
it blows up and we'll,
we'll write the,
you know,

2421
02:24:44.311 --> 02:24:46.830
that it will have the two hour email exchange.
Um,

2422
02:24:47.580 --> 02:24:50.070
and I've tried to debunk this and uh,
uh,

2423
02:24:50.250 --> 02:24:53.220
and one idea I had about how to debunk it as,
as I,

2424
02:24:53.221 --> 02:24:57.660
I noticed that he had a few liberal writers who he really admired.

2425
02:24:57.661 --> 02:25:00.300
And Glenn Greenwald was,
was the top of the list.

2426
02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:03.510
And I knew that Glenn Greenwald couldn't be a nine 11 conspiracy.

2427
02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:07.800
So I reached out to Glenn.
I'd never met Glenn.
And I said,
I said,

2428
02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:13.100
will you do me a favor and just tell me in a short little essay why you don't

2429
02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:17.100
believe any of this stuff?
Why,
why is it that you,
I mean,

2430
02:25:17.101 --> 02:25:20.910
you seem to align with a lot of these concerns,
the overreach of power and,

2431
02:25:20.911 --> 02:25:25.620
you know,
NSA wiretapping and,
and why is it,
why someone in your position,
uh,

2432
02:25:26.110 --> 02:25:30.940
not at all attracted by this nine 11 truth nonsense.
Um,
and he wrote,

2433
02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.320
he wrote the perfect email.
He,
and I told him why I needed this.
I mean,

2434
02:25:34.321 --> 02:25:37.240
I as basically an intervention for,
for a family member.

2435
02:25:37.750 --> 02:25:39.220
He wrote the perfect email,

2436
02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:42.520
which was just crazy enough to give him perfect credibility.
I mean,
he's like,

2437
02:25:42.521 --> 02:25:46.370
you know,
he was like,
you know,
grateful for the nine 11 truth people.
And he was,

2438
02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:50.020
it was,
it was perfect email.
And I imagine that I was going to send this into my,

2439
02:25:50.050 --> 02:25:53.380
um,
my relatives brain and it was going to,

2440
02:25:53.381 --> 02:25:55.780
he was going to have the epiphany that I was expecting,

2441
02:25:55.781 --> 02:26:00.781
which was here's someone he trusts as an authority on all of these points.

2442
02:26:01.450 --> 02:26:06.040
And this is why this guy who's got much more time to look at this,
then,
uh,

2443
02:26:06.250 --> 02:26:10.750
my relative does,
um,
this is why he won't touch it with a 10 foot pole.

2444
02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:13.180
And it had,
it did not have that effect at all.

2445
02:26:13.181 --> 02:26:16.740
All he wanted to do was to get in touch with Glenn Greenwald,
show him all them,

2446
02:26:16.780 --> 02:26:18.900
get to educate them,
show them all this stuff that he hadn't seen it.
Right.

2447
02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:22.710
So anyway,
but I started in this place with Glen,
um,
uh,

2448
02:26:22.990 --> 02:26:27.710
feeling very positive toward him.
And then he,
he just basically in a,

2449
02:26:27.711 --> 02:26:30.640
in a,
in a very unethical way,

2450
02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:34.600
misrepresented my views in a series of articles.

2451
02:26:34.930 --> 02:26:37.570
And when I called him on a privately,
he just doubled down.

2452
02:26:37.650 --> 02:26:40.570
He basically just said,
fuck you.
This is what I,
you,

2453
02:26:40.571 --> 02:26:42.370
even if you don't think this is what you were saying,

2454
02:26:42.371 --> 02:26:46.480
this is what I think you were saying.
Oh Wow.
And um,
what,
what was his argument?

2455
02:26:46.481 --> 02:26:48.700
What w what was his point like?
What was he trying to paint?
Well,

2456
02:26:48.840 --> 02:26:52.960
it was this whole Islamophobia business.
He basically branded me a racist who,

2457
02:26:52.990 --> 02:26:57.550
who hates Muslims.
And there's a,
there's an animus against us against people.

2458
02:26:57.551 --> 02:26:59.400
I'm not talking about ideas.
I'm,
this is,

2459
02:26:59.430 --> 02:27:02.800
this is just by you asking him to write something.
No,
no,
this is,

2460
02:27:02.801 --> 02:27:06.370
this was unrelated,
but this is why I,
this is why the NSA thing,

2461
02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:10.030
this is why the NSA thing was sort of hit me in the,
in,
in the,
uh,

2462
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:13.030
the wrong part of my brain because when,
when Glenn was the,

2463
02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:17.910
was the quarterback for the,
for the Snowden revelations,
um,

2464
02:27:18.670 --> 02:27:22.840
basically I saw a guy who's just blogging and his underpants in Brazil with his

2465
02:27:22.841 --> 02:27:26.530
10 dogs and his boyfriend who was handed this story,
which is in fact true.

2466
02:27:26.530 --> 02:27:29.770
I mean,
if he's not this great investigative journalist who found this,

2467
02:27:29.980 --> 02:27:34.810
he was based on his ideological bias and his track record with someone who

2468
02:27:34.811 --> 02:27:37.750
Snowden liked and thought would be,
you know,

2469
02:27:37.780 --> 02:27:41.590
very sympathetic year for this story.
And he just handed him the story.
I mean,

2470
02:27:41.620 --> 02:27:42.570
you,
so tomorrow night's,

2471
02:27:42.571 --> 02:27:47.500
someone could email you the next big decades shaking story,
right?

2472
02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:51.430
Based on your interests and how they align with his and you,

2473
02:27:51.460 --> 02:27:54.770
that wouldn't make you the greatest investigative journalist.
So anyway,

2474
02:27:54.771 --> 02:27:59.170
so Greenwald was someone who really was not functioning like a journalist,

2475
02:27:59.171 --> 02:28:03.610
and he certainly does not have the principles of honesty and fact checking.

2476
02:28:03.611 --> 02:28:06.200
And admitting when he was wrong,
got something wrong that,

2477
02:28:06.201 --> 02:28:09.250
that most journalists have drummed into them.
So I,
I,

2478
02:28:09.460 --> 02:28:14.460
I find him a very unreliable witness because I've spoken to him in person.

2479
02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:19.600
Why we have a long exchange email,
just email.
I fucking hate email.
I mean,

2480
02:28:19.601 --> 02:28:22.280
I love it,
but I hate it.
Clarifying something

2481
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:23.150
<v 1>as important as this.</v>

2482
02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:26.960
<v 0>Yeah,
no,
it's true.
But I mean in a lot,
and this is another way technology is,</v>

2483
02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:31.470
is screwing us up because we're,
we're,
we are able to,

2484
02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:34.650
things run off the rails when you're riding in a way that they wouldn't face to

2485
02:28:34.651 --> 02:28:34.900
face.

2486
02:28:34.900 --> 02:28:37.540
<v 1>Yeah.
Like a blog about someone you could write some horrible things.</v>

2487
02:28:37.541 --> 02:28:40.230
Whereas if you were sitting in front of that person talking to them and you
said,

2488
02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:42.880
they'd be like,
well,
I don't think that,
no,
you've misinterpreted my position.

2489
02:28:42.881 --> 02:28:44.670
I think this and add respect to Europe.

2490
02:28:44.700 --> 02:28:46.380
And then you could have a nice exchange and said,

2491
02:28:46.390 --> 02:28:50.440
someone just can just spew out their nonsense and a blog with no one checking

2492
02:28:50.441 --> 02:28:52.420
them and then,
you know,
it gets really,

2493
02:28:52.421 --> 02:28:54.970
it gets really squirrely when you're allowed to do that.

2494
02:28:54.971 --> 02:28:58.960
Unchecked with no social cues and that's what he did and he,
but he makes it,

2495
02:28:58.961 --> 02:29:01.190
he considered a virtue.
He,
I mean he said this

2496
02:29:01.490 --> 02:29:05.390
<v 0>in the New York times when he was just becoming famous for the Snowden story.</v>

2497
02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:09.140
He,
they asked him about his approach to journalism and he said,

2498
02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:11.700
he said that he approaches it as a litigator.
He's,

2499
02:29:11.701 --> 02:29:15.830
he assumes people are aligned and then he goes and checks to Joe.

2500
02:29:15.850 --> 02:29:19.710
It goes and tries to prove that they're lying and so and so and may

2501
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:23.810
interpersonally.
This is a highly dysfunctional and obnoxious way to be.

2502
02:29:24.140 --> 02:29:27.080
And so when I'm representing my ideas,

2503
02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:30.280
he's assuming I'm lying and he goes to,

2504
02:29:30.470 --> 02:29:33.890
it goes to try to prove that I'm lying and then he quote minds or he gets

2505
02:29:33.891 --> 02:29:38.240
readers to quote mine my work where he can pull sentences out of context which

2506
02:29:38.250 --> 02:29:40.640
seem out of context.

2507
02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:45.320
I can see how someone would see it as an inflammatory thing to say about Islam.

2508
02:29:45.620 --> 02:29:47.390
But I mean I have not been,

2509
02:29:47.420 --> 02:29:52.040
it's impossible to catch me saying something extreme about Islam that I didn't

2510
02:29:52.041 --> 02:29:54.270
mean to say.
Everything I've ever said about Islam is,

2511
02:29:54.280 --> 02:29:58.820
is it was incredibly well thought out.
I know exactly what I think.

2512
02:29:59.180 --> 02:30:04.180
And it has absolutely no logical relationship to racism because I,

2513
02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:04.700
cause I'm,

2514
02:30:04.700 --> 02:30:09.700
everything I say is it applies every bit as much to Gino John Walker Lindh or

2515
02:30:11.301 --> 02:30:14.150
Adam Gadahn or any white guy who woke up in Marin or,

2516
02:30:14.230 --> 02:30:17.300
or Orange County and decided to join the Jihad.
In fact,

2517
02:30:17.301 --> 02:30:20.960
it applies even more to them because they weren't indoctrinated from birth by

2518
02:30:20.961 --> 02:30:25.920
any,
by any kind of Middle Eastern cultural upbringing.
Um,
and so,
uh,

2519
02:30:26.040 --> 02:30:30.530
so,
so the,
the eye view Greenwald as just the,

2520
02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:31.933
um,

2521
02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:37.100
the least scrupulous and among the most consequential,
uh,

2522
02:30:37.190 --> 02:30:42.190
people who have been flogging this Islamophobia thing and it's,

2523
02:30:42.741 --> 02:30:44.630
it's,
um,
and it's been very ugly.

2524
02:30:44.631 --> 02:30:49.420
And so in so far as the NSA story has been his story,
I,

2525
02:30:49.430 --> 02:30:53.700
it's been,
I've had,
I've had to do a lot of kind of,
uh,
uh,

2526
02:30:53.810 --> 02:30:56.760
parsing of what,
what,
what is it,
what said because his,

2527
02:30:56.761 --> 02:31:01.340
his intuitions about what is important and factual.
I,

2528
02:31:01.341 --> 02:31:05.560
I just fundamentally don't trust so it doesn't have his philosophy on and just

2529
02:31:05.570 --> 02:31:06.470
how he operates.

2530
02:31:07.010 --> 02:31:10.640
But that's not to say that the Edward Snowden story isn't a huge story.

2531
02:31:10.641 --> 02:31:11.480
It's absolutely huge.

2532
02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:13.750
<v 1>How do you win?
I think it is too.</v>

2533
02:31:13.751 --> 02:31:16.440
So for you it's just a very bitter sweet thing because you don't like that guy

2534
02:31:16.520 --> 02:31:17.353
<v 0>personally.</v>

2535
02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:22.560
But also I'm uncertain about where the line is between fax.

2536
02:31:23.401 --> 02:31:25.680
We genuinely want to know and,

2537
02:31:25.710 --> 02:31:29.550
and a public service rendered by journalists and whistle blowers who leak those

2538
02:31:29.551 --> 02:31:34.551
facts and treason that is really consequential that we should have laws against

2539
02:31:35.641 --> 02:31:40.380
and prosecute people for.
And I don't know where Snowden falls on that continuum.

2540
02:31:40.410 --> 02:31:44.910
I just,
I'm just agnostic as to what,
um,
uh,

2541
02:31:44.940 --> 02:31:46.500
I mean I,
10 years from now,

2542
02:31:46.501 --> 02:31:50.610
are we going to think he was a hero or someone who did our country more harm

2543
02:31:50.611 --> 02:31:53.850
than anyone in the last hundred years?
I don't know the answer to that question.

2544
02:31:53.880 --> 02:31:57.000
<v 1>I really think he's the guy who got the ball rolling.
I think that's what it is.</v>

2545
02:31:57.001 --> 02:32:00.390
I think he let people know what was going on behind the scenes for quite a long

2546
02:32:00.391 --> 02:32:03.280
time.
And I think that's good.
No lying right.

2547
02:32:03.300 --> 02:32:06.600
It's what you were talking about in your book.
It's lying.
The government lies.

2548
02:32:06.601 --> 02:32:10.110
And we caught him on a light and now we know it's not,
it's not an ally.
Well,

2549
02:32:10.111 --> 02:32:10.944
it's not a lie

2550
02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:14.910
<v 0>if the NSA,
if the job of the NSA is to spy on people,</v>

2551
02:32:15.330 --> 02:32:17.850
but everybody,
well,
no,
I don't know where it,
so

2552
02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:21.930
<v 1>the government side,
I mean,
no question Obama lied about was large.</v>

2553
02:32:21.931 --> 02:32:22.570
It was going on.

2554
02:32:22.570 --> 02:32:25.210
<v 0>Yeah.
There's this larger question about what,
what do you want the NSA to do,</v>

2555
02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:28.880
right?
What do you want our intelligence or organizations to do?
Um,

2556
02:32:29.710 --> 02:32:33.650
that is,
I don't feel like I'm a,

2557
02:32:33.680 --> 02:32:38.680
I mean if given a menu of things to check off you,

2558
02:32:38.700 --> 02:32:41.800
you and I may check off check different boxes and what we want them to do.

2559
02:32:42.130 --> 02:32:44.470
And frankly,
I don't know,
uh,

2560
02:32:44.950 --> 02:32:47.700
where I draw the line on some of these questions because it's,
you know,
I,

2561
02:32:47.730 --> 02:32:51.970
I'm just a conversation away from someone who has more information than me about

2562
02:32:51.971 --> 02:32:55.130
top secret information,
um,

2563
02:32:57.190 --> 02:33:02.140
from being convinced that,
oh yeah,
we really do want that information.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2564
02:33:02.141 --> 02:33:06.070
I don't want my daughter to grow up in a world where nukes are going off in our

2565
02:33:06.071 --> 02:33:10.660
cities.
So yeah,
if you're telling me that,
that tapping that phone or reading,

2566
02:33:10.900 --> 02:33:15.700
reading all email,
if only retrospectively,
um,

2567
02:33:15.701 --> 02:33:19.510
is a way to stop that.
And here's why.
Here's why you think that,
um,

2568
02:33:19.700 --> 02:33:22.840
I could be sold on all of these points.
I mean,
there's nothing about,

2569
02:33:22.900 --> 02:33:27.900
there's nothing about my email that I feel like needs to be private.

2570
02:33:29.350 --> 02:33:33.820
If you keep raising the stakes on the side of arguing why it shouldn't be

2571
02:33:33.821 --> 02:33:34.410
private.

2572
02:33:34.410 --> 02:33:39.410
<v 1>But isn't the argument always that the United States has shown a long history of</v>

2573
02:33:39.721 --> 02:33:42.750
deception?
I mean,
how do you,
how do you,

2574
02:33:42.930 --> 02:33:47.400
like when you put this into your box,
what do,
what do you put false flags?

2575
02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:48.353
Where do you put though?
Yeah,

2576
02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:49.810
<v 0>well,
no,
the,
I mean that,
that's the,</v>

2577
02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:54.820
so the consequence of having a government that lies on issues like that over and

2578
02:33:55.751 --> 02:33:58.060
over and over and over again since the beginning of time.
I know it's,

2579
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:59.700
it's the most toxic thing and yeah,

2580
02:34:00.030 --> 02:34:03.550
<v 1>but you're giving them opportunity to have,
this is not bad power,</v>

2581
02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:04.080
<v 0>but this is,</v>

2582
02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:08.600
but so I talk about this briefly in my book about espionage being something that

2583
02:34:08.601 --> 02:34:13.280
if you grant that undercover operations are sometimes necessary,

2584
02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:14.780
then you,

2585
02:34:14.780 --> 02:34:18.640
what you're saying is there is some space in which otherwise good and ethical

2586
02:34:18.641 --> 02:34:23.440
people are going to need to lie now with,
so the way I,
I think about that is,

2587
02:34:24.100 --> 02:34:27.520
I think that is necessary.
I think it is,
it is.
Someone is a,

2588
02:34:27.521 --> 02:34:31.090
it is a life that I don't want.
I couldn't be,
I couldn't work for the NSA,

2589
02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:33.820
but it's an unfortunate fact and the fact that,
yeah,
yeah,
I couldn't,

2590
02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:36.910
so I couldn't be the guy who comes home to his wife and lies about what he did

2591
02:34:36.911 --> 02:34:38.940
all day.
Right.
Because that's part of the career.
Um,

2592
02:34:39.250 --> 02:34:40.400
I don't want to be that person.
I,

2593
02:34:40.401 --> 02:34:44.540
I view it as a kind of moral self-immolation where you just,
you're,
you,

2594
02:34:44.590 --> 02:34:48.070
you have to take a hit for the team in this spectacular way,

2595
02:34:48.310 --> 02:34:53.050
in order to function in that space.
And,
um,
but I think it's probably necessary.

2596
02:34:53.110 --> 02:34:56.200
And so,
but it's,
but within that frame,

2597
02:34:56.201 --> 02:35:00.130
it's not actually deceptive if the NSA,
the NSA says,
listen,
we're going to,

2598
02:35:00.250 --> 02:35:03.830
we're going to suck up a ton of data.
Um,

2599
02:35:03.910 --> 02:35:06.590
and we're going to abide by laws.
We're not going to,

2600
02:35:06.610 --> 02:35:09.760
we're not going to imprison you for,
uh,

2601
02:35:09.850 --> 02:35:14.620
growing pot based on having stuck this data up.
But we're looking for jihadists.

2602
02:35:15.220 --> 02:35:19.680
That's something I can sign onto.
And we may want to,
you know,

2603
02:35:19.720 --> 02:35:22.610
read the fine print there.
Uh,
but,
um,

2604
02:35:23.550 --> 02:35:27.250
I was never under the illusion that the NSA was doing anything other than that.

2605
02:35:27.670 --> 02:35:29.810
So it's not,
that's not a surprise to me.
I,

2606
02:35:29.880 --> 02:35:34.440
and I don't think it's a surprise to anyone.
And so,
and,
and keeping,
you know,

2607
02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:37.970
lying and keeping secrets are different things.
We,
you know,

2608
02:35:38.470 --> 02:35:42.640
we need people to keep secrets.
We need.
And,
and you can honestly keep a secret.

2609
02:35:42.641 --> 02:35:46.270
You can,
the president can say,
I can't tell you that that's top secret.

2610
02:35:46.540 --> 02:35:49.400
Our national security depends on my not telling you that.
Right?

2611
02:35:49.401 --> 02:35:51.820
That's an honest statement.
And if you know,
if you,

2612
02:35:51.821 --> 02:35:54.880
if I asked you how much money you have in your bank account,
you know,
tell me,

2613
02:35:54.881 --> 02:35:58.420
tell our listeners now you can say,
I don't want to say that's,
that's,

2614
02:35:58.650 --> 02:35:59.650
that's an honest statement.

2615
02:35:59.890 --> 02:36:02.230
<v 1>When you talked earlier about your friend,</v>

2616
02:36:02.260 --> 02:36:05.890
the story about the woman who lied in front of her friend immediately damaged

2617
02:36:05.891 --> 02:36:09.580
the relationship.
Right?
Why would you ever,

2618
02:36:10.180 --> 02:36:14.440
knowing that the government has planned and possibly executed false flags,

2619
02:36:14.650 --> 02:36:18.190
why would you ever give them the benefit of the doubt?
Well,
again,
this,

2620
02:36:18.191 --> 02:36:20.890
this comes to,
um,
that's,
I mean

2621
02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:23.460
<v 0>the larger question of human nature.
So what,</v>

2622
02:36:23.470 --> 02:36:27.310
like what do you think is going on in the world?
Do you think that there are it,

2623
02:36:27.311 --> 02:36:30.880
most people,
most of the time are psychopaths or,

2624
02:36:30.910 --> 02:36:35.080
or a ruthlessly mercenary and,
uh,

2625
02:36:35.081 --> 02:36:36.820
out to just screw everyone?

2626
02:36:36.850 --> 02:36:41.850
Or do you think those are the anomalies and what do you think of government?

2627
02:36:42.621 --> 02:36:46.330
Do you think government is so corrupting of otherwise good people that they're

2628
02:36:46.331 --> 02:36:48.100
just going to just,

2629
02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:52.570
just going to run riot with their power all the time and everywhere?

2630
02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:57.220
Or do you think basically it's a lot of good people inefficiently trying to get

2631
02:36:57.221 --> 02:37:00.310
stuff done that we need done?
And if you're on the,

2632
02:37:00.370 --> 02:37:05.350
I think the more realistic side of that,
of those questions,
I think,

2633
02:37:05.351 --> 02:37:09.490
I think you have to admit that,
that it's,

2634
02:37:09.820 --> 02:37:11.880
for the most part,
they're,

2635
02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:16.920
they're people just like us in a bureaucracy trying to get stuff done and their

2636
02:37:17.931 --> 02:37:18.764
influence.
I mean,

2637
02:37:18.790 --> 02:37:23.790
there are so many competing interests that the bad people don't have as much

2638
02:37:23.961 --> 02:37:25.780
power as you fear.
They have a,

2639
02:37:25.781 --> 02:37:29.000
and the good people don't have as much power as you want them to have.
And so,

2640
02:37:29.001 --> 02:37:29.810
so to,

2641
02:37:29.810 --> 02:37:34.810
so to conspire to just grab all the strings of the military and,

2642
02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:41.560
uh,
wage a war on false pretenses or,
uh,
you know,
sit,

2643
02:37:41.570 --> 02:37:44.180
divert our fighter jets so that these,

2644
02:37:44.220 --> 02:37:48.320
this hijack plane can fly into the World Trade Center.
Um,
I mean,

2645
02:37:48.321 --> 02:37:51.960
how many people in the,
in the air force had to conspire to decide to,
you know,

2646
02:37:51.980 --> 02:37:55.460
run war games elsewhere so that we wouldn't be able to respond?
I mean,

2647
02:37:55.461 --> 02:37:58.490
you're then you're at what you're attributing to people are conscious motives to

2648
02:37:58.491 --> 02:38:02.600
kill massive numbers of innocent people that I just,
I think,
um,

2649
02:38:02.810 --> 02:38:05.870
just could not form in the minds of most people most of the time.

2650
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:09.870
<v 1>Well,
if that's the case,
then how did false flags ever get planned out?</v>

2651
02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:13.980
How was the Northwoods document ever signed by the Joint Chiefs of staff and

2652
02:38:13.981 --> 02:38:17.760
vetoed by Kennedy when they were planning on arming Cuban friendlies and bombing

2653
02:38:17.761 --> 02:38:20.160
Guantanamo Bay,
right?
Where they were going to have a drone.

2654
02:38:20.161 --> 02:38:23.600
Jetliner they're going to have a jet and blow it up and then we're going to

2655
02:38:23.601 --> 02:38:26.100
blame it on the Cubans.
They were going to kill Americans.

2656
02:38:26.130 --> 02:38:27.840
They're going to kill Americans in Guantanamo Bay.

2657
02:38:27.841 --> 02:38:30.900
How could that possibly fall into what you're saying?

2658
02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:34.350
<v 0>Well,
no,
there,
there are,
I mean,
so,
so we,</v>

2659
02:38:34.410 --> 02:38:38.160
but we do this all that we kill Americans all the time.
Right?
But like that,

2660
02:38:38.620 --> 02:38:40.360
<v 1>no,
US pull the trigger in order to,</v>

2661
02:38:40.540 --> 02:38:43.780
how could you possibly justify that is that's the only way to do it.

2662
02:38:43.900 --> 02:38:47.260
The only way to do it is to have a false flag event where we kill Americans and

2663
02:38:47.261 --> 02:38:49.000
lie and blaming on other people.

2664
02:38:49.001 --> 02:38:51.520
I mean that goes against the very doctrine of the line book that goes against

2665
02:38:51.521 --> 02:38:54.880
the very idea that human interaction should be at all times honest,

2666
02:38:54.881 --> 02:38:56.560
especially at the highest levels of government.

2667
02:38:56.710 --> 02:38:58.990
It should in fact be even more important.

2668
02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:00.260
<v 0>No,
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not saying it's a,</v>

2669
02:39:00.270 --> 02:39:04.430
it's a good thing and I'm saying the consequence of finding out that one such

2670
02:39:04.431 --> 02:39:06.860
event has occurred,
not just one.
There's been many.
No,

2671
02:39:06.861 --> 02:39:10.850
but the consequence of even one is this very conversation,

2672
02:39:11.210 --> 02:39:13.580
these very doubts in the minds of millions of people.

2673
02:39:13.850 --> 02:39:17.900
<v 1>Wouldn't you assume when there's been several that it's probably a a method of</v>

2674
02:39:17.901 --> 02:39:20.810
operating that that's how they do it.
If you find out about the Gulf of Tonkin,

2675
02:39:20.811 --> 02:39:23.930
you find out what Bush and Cheney we're planning on Iran before they left
office.

2676
02:39:24.140 --> 02:39:26.840
When you fall or allegedly,
what do I know?
You know when you,

2677
02:39:26.841 --> 02:39:29.190
when you find out what the Northwoods document,
what do you mean?

2678
02:39:29.210 --> 02:39:30.920
Where do you put all that?
That's,
that's clear.

2679
02:39:31.010 --> 02:39:36.010
That's people that are on our side killing our people in order to get us into a

2680
02:39:36.621 --> 02:39:39.440
war.
When we kill other people and profit like crazy.

2681
02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:43.070
It seems pretty cut and dry and I think there might be,

2682
02:39:43.390 --> 02:39:46.310
you mean looking at it the way you're looking at it?
I see what you're saying,

2683
02:39:46.311 --> 02:39:48.020
but not with all the evidence,

2684
02:39:48.050 --> 02:39:50.900
not what all the evidence that it's actually happened.
I see what you're saying.

2685
02:39:50.900 --> 02:39:52.310
If there wasn't any evidence,

2686
02:39:52.550 --> 02:39:55.400
if it was just nine 11 and everybody was using that as an example,

2687
02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:56.151
I agree with you.

2688
02:39:56.151 --> 02:40:00.350
I think it's probably most likely a series of coincidences and most likely we

2689
02:40:00.351 --> 02:40:04.010
just had lax security and most likely 19 people plan this out and pulled it off.

2690
02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:06.650
However,
when you look at the Gulf of Tonkin,

2691
02:40:06.651 --> 02:40:08.900
when you look at the Northwoods incident,
when you look at,

2692
02:40:09.140 --> 02:40:13.470
you look at all these different things that we have planned,
it's not one,

2693
02:40:13.530 --> 02:40:16.680
it's several and it's several over the course of several different

2694
02:40:16.681 --> 02:40:20.460
administrations.
The Bush administration,
I mean the,
the,
the,

2695
02:40:20.461 --> 02:40:23.760
the Kennedy Administration,
I mean,
the,
during Kennedy's Day they were doing this,

2696
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:28.830
<v 0>well,
what I would say is that in the case of nine 11,</v>

2697
02:40:28.860 --> 02:40:32.730
you have on the other side,
a,
a,

2698
02:40:33.570 --> 02:40:37.660
a very obvious conspiracy that's taking credit for it that has taken credit for

2699
02:40:37.661 --> 02:40:41.760
it.
I mean,
you have this,
this phenomenon of al Qaeda and Global Jihad,
uh,

2700
02:40:41.761 --> 02:40:42.680
which much of which is,

2701
02:40:42.681 --> 02:40:46.740
there is much of this violence is directed at the rest of the Muslim world.

2702
02:40:46.741 --> 02:40:48.750
And it's not just us,
but you have,

2703
02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:53.870
we have a clear enemy that thinks it's our enemy that is taking credit for,

2704
02:40:54.380 --> 02:40:57.000
uh,
these,
these,
uh,
uh,

2705
02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:02.490
goals that immune to call them an own goal.
When you have someone,
uh,
who's,

2706
02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:07.350
who's seemed to be the kicker and who's taking credit for being the kicker.
And,

2707
02:41:07.380 --> 02:41:11.970
um,
it just seems like a,
um,
it's a misapplication of the principle.

2708
02:41:11.971 --> 02:41:15.600
Even if we were going to agree that,
that,
that,
that we,

2709
02:41:16.900 --> 02:41:17.190
you know,

2710
02:41:17.190 --> 02:41:22.020
every few years draw our own blood for some perverse reason of trying to,

2711
02:41:22.110 --> 02:41:25.670
to,
to motivate ourselves to do something we wouldn't otherwise want to do.

2712
02:41:25.810 --> 02:41:26.051
<v 1>Well,</v>

2713
02:41:26.051 --> 02:41:29.410
I would assume that if there's a series of events that have taken place that

2714
02:41:29.411 --> 02:41:31.960
have absolutely either been planned or,
absolutely,
I mean,

2715
02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:34.210
the Northwoods document is pretty straight forward.
It's,

2716
02:41:34.211 --> 02:41:35.500
there's really no denying it.

2717
02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:40.090
A Gulf of Tonkin basically reported in history classes today that that was a

2718
02:41:40.091 --> 02:41:44.230
false flag event.
Right.
So those are,
those are real,
forget about nine 11.

2719
02:41:44.231 --> 02:41:45.064
Let's throw that in there.

2720
02:41:45.580 --> 02:41:50.410
<v 0>Gulf of Tonkin.
Yeah.
In the book.
And,
and,
and they're,
you know,
many other,
um,</v>

2721
02:41:50.710 --> 02:41:53.740
it more easily understood,
uh,
uh,

2722
02:41:53.980 --> 02:41:56.710
La big lies that should worry us.
So for instance,

2723
02:41:56.711 --> 02:42:00.340
I mentioned pharmaceutical companies and big pharmaceutical companies seem to

2724
02:42:00.341 --> 02:42:03.130
clearly rig their data.
Uh,

2725
02:42:03.190 --> 02:42:08.190
and this puts people in a state of chronic doubt about whether you can trust

2726
02:42:08.771 --> 02:42:11.290
anyone in a position of authority you got when you have people,

2727
02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:16.480
there's no one who knows more about whether drugs are efficacious,

2728
02:42:16.810 --> 02:42:19.120
then the people who are designing drugs,

2729
02:42:19.250 --> 02:42:19.461
<v 1>right?</v>

2730
02:42:19.461 --> 02:42:21.890
But doesn't that kind of disingenuous you dealing with an entirely different

2731
02:42:21.891 --> 02:42:24.120
group of people that you're saying are also evil?
Does it?

2732
02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:27.660
<v 0>No,
I'm not saying it's evil.
I'm saying,
I'm saying that the,
the,</v>

2733
02:42:27.661 --> 02:42:30.720
the principal that is,
well,
one,
there's two principles.

2734
02:42:30.721 --> 02:42:32.460
One is just a willingness to lie.
That's right.

2735
02:42:32.730 --> 02:42:36.360
That is the thing that enables all of us.
But there's also just,
um,

2736
02:42:36.420 --> 02:42:39.690
and I think this is,
this is,
um,
the most,

2737
02:42:39.900 --> 02:42:44.900
the most important change we could make and in our society as it is to notice

2738
02:42:44.911 --> 02:42:48.450
the ways in which systems of incentives,

2739
02:42:48.750 --> 02:42:52.350
because otherwise good people to behave like bad people.
And they're,

2740
02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:54.330
they're endless numbers of examples of this.

2741
02:42:54.331 --> 02:42:59.010
But you don't have to be a bad person to behave in evil ways.

2742
02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:02.040
If you're part of a system,
you know,
the,
the,

2743
02:43:02.041 --> 02:43:06.780
the entire tendency of which is to inclined toward evil.
So if you are,

2744
02:43:07.060 --> 02:43:10.170
and if you just follow the incentives,
and so they're very simple,

2745
02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:12.940
kind of a petri dish.
Examples of this.

2746
02:43:12.941 --> 02:43:17.941
And then one example I use is if you talk about what it's like to be thrown into

2747
02:43:18.341 --> 02:43:19.590
a maximum security prison,
I mean,

2748
02:43:19.591 --> 02:43:24.591
I imagine you get sent to Folsom prison and you're an innocent person.

2749
02:43:25.691 --> 02:43:29.200
You're not,
you're not a violent person.
You want,
and you're,
you have this,

2750
02:43:29.290 --> 02:43:32.830
this nightmare experience of now you're thrown in prison for a crime he didn't

2751
02:43:32.831 --> 02:43:34.210
commit.
And

2752
02:43:35.770 --> 02:43:40.000
all you want to do is get through your,
that this experience,
you know,

2753
02:43:40.001 --> 02:43:43.360
your 10 years,
say,
all you want to do is do your decade of,
of,

2754
02:43:43.420 --> 02:43:47.740
of time in peace unmolested by all these other people.

2755
02:43:48.180 --> 02:43:51.940
Uh,
and you're terrified that you're going to be victimized by people.

2756
02:43:52.370 --> 02:43:56.280
That the reality is that you are,
you're coming into a situation where the,
the,

2757
02:43:56.650 --> 02:44:01.650
the incentives are so perversely misaligned that even a good person like you who

2758
02:44:02.411 --> 02:44:04.060
just wants to be a nice guy,

2759
02:44:04.390 --> 02:44:09.390
it's going to have to align himself with a psycho Rena,

2760
02:44:09.791 --> 02:44:14.470
racist psychopaths,
uh,
in order to not be screwed over by everyone.

2761
02:44:14.650 --> 02:44:18.880
I mean,
so for instance,
you'd have to so,
so in,
in most maximum security prisons,

2762
02:44:19.390 --> 02:44:22.180
they exist in a perpetual state of race war.
So as you know,

2763
02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:25.810
the whites against the blacks against the Mexicans,
they get you to and,
and uh,

2764
02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:29.380
certain Mexicans against other Mexicans,
but it's just like you have,

2765
02:44:30.020 --> 02:44:35.020
it's shattered into racial gangs and a white guy,

2766
02:44:35.291 --> 02:44:38.710
like you would have to join a,
a white supremacist Yang.

2767
02:44:38.740 --> 02:44:42.460
Now you might not have a racist,
you might not have a racist bone in your body,

2768
02:44:42.461 --> 02:44:47.080
but the only way for you not to be fucked over by everyone is to align yourself

2769
02:44:47.081 --> 02:44:50.320
with a gang,
isn't what you're saying.
Another reason not trust the government.

2770
02:44:50.321 --> 02:44:51.670
You're saying that the government's evil.

2771
02:44:51.680 --> 02:44:54.340
You're saying the gun people do evil things because they get involved with evil

2772
02:44:54.341 --> 02:44:55.980
psychopaths,
meaning the government?
No,
no.

2773
02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:58.450
Which is why I'm saying that was flags occur.
Oh No,

2774
02:44:58.451 --> 02:45:01.110
I'm saying that we need to be aware of,

2775
02:45:01.150 --> 02:45:05.570
of the way incentives can be perverse.
Where,
where,
where you,
you,

2776
02:45:05.571 --> 02:45:10.571
your natural selfishness and your natural fear and your natural desire just to,

2777
02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:16.200
just to survive can be channeled in ways that make you as an otherwise good

2778
02:45:17.921 --> 02:45:22.030
person,
uh,
uh,
collaborating to,
to,

2779
02:45:22.090 --> 02:45:24.380
to do terrible things.
And there's,
there,
there,

2780
02:45:24.520 --> 02:45:27.580
there are many ways in which be so conflicts of interest are,

2781
02:45:27.581 --> 02:45:28.800
the classic example is you have,

2782
02:45:28.801 --> 02:45:33.801
you have CEOs who can run the global economy off a cliff because their

2783
02:45:35.021 --> 02:45:37.000
incentives are totally perverse.
They have no,
they have,

2784
02:45:37.001 --> 02:45:42.001
there's no economic incentive for them not to just leverage their company out of

2785
02:45:42.071 --> 02:45:46.450
existence if they've,
you know,
if,
if,
if they can benefit from this,

2786
02:45:46.451 --> 02:45:50.800
this windfall,
you know,
pop of the stock and they have a golden parachute.

2787
02:45:50.801 --> 02:45:51.620
I mean there's,
so there's the,

2788
02:45:51.620 --> 02:45:53.770
there's the problem of moral hazard where it's like there's no,

2789
02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:57.910
if there's no consequence to being rapaciously selfish,

2790
02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:00.970
you're going to get people being re patiently selfish to the detriment of

2791
02:46:00.971 --> 02:46:01.780
everyone.
And so,

2792
02:46:01.780 --> 02:46:05.770
and so the point I'm making is that sort of two levels at which you can,

2793
02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:08.680
you can try to improve human life.
You can,

2794
02:46:08.681 --> 02:46:12.700
you can argue that each person needs to have a,

2795
02:46:13.030 --> 02:46:17.180
a more more refined ethical code,
you know,
you have,
you have to be more honest.

2796
02:46:17.210 --> 02:46:21.440
I have to be more honest.
Or uh,
you can have,

2797
02:46:21.890 --> 02:46:26.030
or in addition you can have systems where interests are aligned so that,

2798
02:46:26.031 --> 02:46:30.110
so that we match.
So that the,
the,
the penalties for the,
the,
the,

2799
02:46:30.140 --> 02:46:35.040
the rewards for honesty or more obvious.
And,
and,
and um,

2800
02:46:35.090 --> 02:46:38.260
I mean you'd have a system where,
where people,
I mean,

2801
02:46:38.750 --> 02:46:41.390
another classic example is like,
I like the job market where people,

2802
02:46:41.391 --> 02:46:44.840
everyone's patting their resumes because they know everyone else pads their

2803
02:46:44.841 --> 02:46:47.840
resumes.
So it's like you're trying to get a job.
You're desperate to get a job,

2804
02:46:47.870 --> 02:46:50.270
your,
that your family won't eat unless you get a job.

2805
02:46:50.750 --> 02:46:53.900
And you know that every one else applying for this job has padded.

2806
02:46:53.901 --> 02:46:57.860
His resume has lied about his background.
So everyone else does false flags.

2807
02:46:57.861 --> 02:47:00.680
So Obama gets an office and does exactly the same thing.

2808
02:47:00.681 --> 02:47:03.890
It's that we're saying no,
no,
I'm saying,
I'm saying that,
that we need,

2809
02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:06.160
there's two levels at which we address these problems.
And,

2810
02:47:06.161 --> 02:47:10.030
and w one problem you're pointing to is,
is,
um,

2811
02:47:10.610 --> 02:47:15.230
a system level in,
in this case,
government level,
uh,
uh,

2812
02:47:15.580 --> 02:47:19.150
misalign misaligned incentives that have great consequence,
which,

2813
02:47:19.190 --> 02:47:23.720
which don't require evil people all the time to pull the string.

2814
02:47:23.780 --> 02:47:26.350
You don't think they requires evil people to do a false flood over.

2815
02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:27.680
But in a false,

2816
02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:32.800
if you're saying we're going to blow up a jet and fake and pretend that another

2817
02:47:32.811 --> 02:47:35.540
country did it,
um,
yeah,

2818
02:47:35.541 --> 02:47:38.660
that would require evil people to,

2819
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:42.590
to hatched the idea and say,
do it.
In all fairness,

2820
02:47:42.591 --> 02:47:45.020
I think there was an empty jet.
I think they're going to,
no,
no,
no.

2821
02:47:45.021 --> 02:47:50.000
I'm so think of a prototypical situation where it seems,
um,

2822
02:47:50.990 --> 02:47:54.980
uh,
as bad as possible.
Yes.
That would require,
um,
I mean,

2823
02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:58.580
the reason why I don't believe the September 11th conspiracy theory is that

2824
02:47:58.581 --> 02:48:02.810
would,
it would require too many evil people.
It just makes no sense.

2825
02:48:02.870 --> 02:48:06.260
I still don't understand how you rectify the idea of false flags.

2826
02:48:06.261 --> 02:48:09.680
Like where do you put that?
Well,
I,
so the,
I mean,
there are many fall,

2827
02:48:09.700 --> 02:48:11.930
I don't know which,
which are true.
I mean,

2828
02:48:11.931 --> 02:48:15.380
I believe the Gulf of Tonkin Tonkin was a false flag.
And what about North Woods?

2829
02:48:15.770 --> 02:48:18.860
I don't know enough about it.
Okay.
What about the,

2830
02:48:19.010 --> 02:48:20.370
did you pay any attention to the,

2831
02:48:20.371 --> 02:48:24.440
the plan allegedly that Bush and Cheney were concocting to get us into Iran

2832
02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:28.370
before he left office?
I don't know if that's true at all.
No.
No,
but so,

2833
02:48:28.371 --> 02:48:31.060
so for instance,
there's a new book about the Kennedy assassination,
which,

2834
02:48:31.150 --> 02:48:32.600
which brings,
and I don't know if I,

2835
02:48:32.610 --> 02:48:35.750
I don't think the guy is a conspiracy theorist at all here,

2836
02:48:35.751 --> 02:48:39.450
but I think he thinks Oswald did it.
But there's a new book which showed us,

2837
02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:44.930
I don't,
I dunno,
I mean,
I think,
I think it's,
I think it's a very likely that the,

2838
02:48:45.140 --> 02:48:48.440
I mean the Warren Commission seemed,
I haven't read this book,
but,
but,
um,

2839
02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:53.270
from what I know,
the Warren Commission seems to have been a ridiculously inept,

2840
02:48:53.530 --> 02:48:54.630
<v 3>uh,
uh,</v>

2841
02:48:55.590 --> 02:49:00.090
<v 0>effort to get to the truth and with many,
um,</v>

2842
02:49:00.920 --> 02:49:01.753
<v 3>uh,</v>

2843
02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:06.210
<v 0>perverse obstacles to getting to the truth.
One being that,</v>

2844
02:49:06.240 --> 02:49:10.560
that Warren want to inconvenience,
uh,

2845
02:49:10.620 --> 02:49:12.970
Jacqueline Kennedy at all.
So I mean,
she's,
she's grieving.

2846
02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:16.170
He didn't want to interview her.
He wouldn't let her be interviewed on the,

2847
02:49:16.171 --> 02:49:19.920
you know,
on the record.
He interviewed her at her himself,
I think.
And,

2848
02:49:19.921 --> 02:49:22.980
and it just sort of summarized what she said.
Um,

2849
02:49:23.220 --> 02:49:27.960
so there's just all kind of weird ways in which this thing was never about

2850
02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:32.810
really getting to the bottom of what happened.
But,
uh,
the,
the,

2851
02:49:32.811 --> 02:49:37.170
the point is that when you look at all the way,
but like,
that is a,

2852
02:49:37.530 --> 02:49:40.590
that's a,
that's an all too human made that you,
you can,

2853
02:49:40.591 --> 02:49:44.040
you can look at it some nefarious interpretation of that.
Like,
you know,

2854
02:49:44.041 --> 02:49:48.600
he knew that this was a mob hit that was enabled by the CIA or whatever the

2855
02:49:48.601 --> 02:49:53.430
story is.
Um,
and you know,
this is his way of,
of,
of,
uh,

2856
02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:58.080
you know,
hiding the truth or he's just a guy who is embarrassed to ask this,

2857
02:49:58.081 --> 02:50:02.460
the grieving widow who was,
who was a,
you know,
a friend of his,

2858
02:50:02.790 --> 02:50:05.880
a about what it was like to see her husband's face get blown off.
You know,

2859
02:50:05.881 --> 02:50:09.420
so it's like they're there,
there are alternate explanations for these things.

2860
02:50:09.421 --> 02:50:13.200
And yet the conspiracy side is always,
um,
uh,

2861
02:50:13.230 --> 02:50:17.670
the nefarious mustache twirling,
perfect genius of evil interpretation.

2862
02:50:17.700 --> 02:50:21.980
And I think that,
uh,
it rarely is true,
uh,

2863
02:50:22.050 --> 02:50:26.400
certainly in a society where political power is not as concentrated as it is.

2864
02:50:26.401 --> 02:50:28.530
And,
uh,
you know,
in the,
under the Third Reich,

2865
02:50:29.150 --> 02:50:31.280
<v 1>I think there's probably a little bit of both in there.</v>

2866
02:50:31.340 --> 02:50:35.450
I think there's definitely some inept,
uh,
qualities of the Warren Commission,

2867
02:50:35.451 --> 02:50:39.830
but there's also this search for a predetermined outcome.
That's why they,
the,

2868
02:50:39.890 --> 02:50:42.770
the whole reason why the magic bullet theory was invented was because there was

2869
02:50:42.771 --> 02:50:45.650
a bullet that hit a curb stone underneath the overpass.

2870
02:50:45.860 --> 02:50:48.650
They had account for that.
That's why they accounted for one bullet,

2871
02:50:48.651 --> 02:50:51.190
doing all this damage to different people instead of,
you know,

2872
02:50:51.230 --> 02:50:52.490
making them more obvious.
Conclusion.

2873
02:50:52.491 --> 02:50:55.010
There was more than one more than one shooter.
I mean,

2874
02:50:55.011 --> 02:50:57.740
that seems much more likely.
I mean,
if one person was shooting,

2875
02:50:57.741 --> 02:51:00.380
why would you just assume that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't have a cohort?

2876
02:51:00.410 --> 02:51:03.500
Why would you just assume that?
I mean,
they want it to wrap it up nice and tidy.

2877
02:51:03.680 --> 02:51:07.160
The same reason why Jack Ruby got to Lee Harvey Oswald in front of all those

2878
02:51:07.161 --> 02:51:10.760
cops,
know security shoots him,
puts it to end,
you know,

2879
02:51:10.761 --> 02:51:14.690
he had all these obvious mob ties.
I mean,
it's so obvious.
It's so silly.
In fact,

2880
02:51:14.780 --> 02:51:18.710
to think that there wasn't something going on.
I think the truth,

2881
02:51:18.740 --> 02:51:22.520
like many things lie somewhere in the middle.
It's not an either or situation,

2882
02:51:22.760 --> 02:51:26.270
but I don't think Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.
He might've been a part of it.

2883
02:51:26.271 --> 02:51:29.390
It's very possible he was a part of it,
but I don't think he acted alone.

2884
02:51:29.690 --> 02:51:30.480
But usually it was what's

2885
02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:33.390
<v 0>going on.
And again,
I'm not discounting the fact that there,</v>

2886
02:51:33.510 --> 02:51:38.510
there are situations in which evil people brilliantly bring off they're evil or

2887
02:51:39.930 --> 02:51:41.610
evil,
conspirators conspire.

2888
02:51:41.640 --> 02:51:46.640
But most of the time it's people rather like us afraid for their jobs,

2889
02:51:47.461 --> 02:51:51.900
covering their asses,
afraid of getting sued,
doing things,

2890
02:51:51.901 --> 02:51:56.280
which when incentives are aligned in such a way as to make it effortless for

2891
02:51:56.281 --> 02:52:00.030
them to do them,
create a huge mess for everybody else.

2892
02:52:00.060 --> 02:52:01.190
And so you want me to judge when you,

2893
02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:03.540
when you look at what people do because they're going to,

2894
02:52:03.541 --> 02:52:06.420
if they're afraid to get sued,
you know,
just look at the,

2895
02:52:06.430 --> 02:52:10.450
just look at all of the stupid decisions people make in our society because they

2896
02:52:10.451 --> 02:52:14.110
just want to,
they want to hide the problem.
It's a,
there's a,
there's a book on,

2897
02:52:14.111 --> 02:52:18.260
um,
on,
uh,
what it's like to become a neurosurgeon.
I called,
uh,

2898
02:52:18.460 --> 02:52:20.020
when the air hits your brain and it's a,

2899
02:52:20.110 --> 02:52:24.130
it's a pretty entertaining and somewhat heroin look at just the training of a

2900
02:52:24.131 --> 02:52:25.600
neurosurgeon.
And there was,

2901
02:52:25.630 --> 02:52:28.270
so he talks about what it was like to be a resonant neurosurgeon.

2902
02:52:28.660 --> 02:52:32.910
And at one point there's a scene where a resident is a,
um,

2903
02:52:33.580 --> 02:52:37.240
is performing his first,
uh,
prepping us for surgery,

2904
02:52:37.241 --> 02:52:42.000
which entails drilling into a person's skull and,
and cutting them,
you know,
uh,

2905
02:52:42.150 --> 02:52:46.580
a large hole and,
uh,
prepping the,
uh,

2906
02:52:46.900 --> 02:52:50.400
uh,
the person's,
uh,
head for this,
the,

2907
02:52:50.500 --> 02:52:53.200
the chief neurosurgeon to come in and perform surgery.

2908
02:52:53.530 --> 02:52:57.400
And what he did is he drove the drill in way too deep.
Like,
you know,

2909
02:52:57.401 --> 02:52:59.870
it was supposed to go,
it was just,
just supposed to do skull,

2910
02:52:59.871 --> 02:53:03.880
but he just went into,
you know,
pure pink oatmeal,
um,

2911
02:53:04.150 --> 02:53:05.200
of the person's brain.

2912
02:53:05.590 --> 02:53:09.850
And his only concern at that moment was not how the patient was doing.

2913
02:53:09.850 --> 02:53:13.060
It was to hide the evidence that he had screwed up.

2914
02:53:13.330 --> 02:53:16.540
Now that isn't all too human and in the aggregate,

2915
02:53:16.630 --> 02:53:19.990
completely evil outcome.
And yet he,

2916
02:53:20.140 --> 02:53:23.800
he doesn't have to be a psychopath to be worried about covering his ass and that

2917
02:53:23.801 --> 02:53:25.080
circumstance to natural human ins.

2918
02:53:25.110 --> 02:53:29.920
And that's if you had a system in which he would be massively rewarded in some

2919
02:53:29.921 --> 02:53:33.700
way for showing,
exposing that problem.
Um,

2920
02:53:33.850 --> 02:53:35.500
I mean it's hard to see how you would design that,

2921
02:53:35.501 --> 02:53:37.590
but that would be a much better system.
You know,

2922
02:53:37.660 --> 02:53:40.200
if the incentives were aligned in a way that,
that,
that,

2923
02:53:40.250 --> 02:53:44.290
that his guilty conscience would,
would win as opposed to his,
you know,

2924
02:53:44.291 --> 02:53:49.291
his effort to preserve his career so he could stay free so he could stay free.

2925
02:53:49.601 --> 02:53:53.540
So you wouldn't get jailed or sue.
Yeah.
Or,
or just just,
no,

2926
02:53:53.570 --> 02:53:56.290
no longer have a career in medicine,
you know,
I mean that's,

2927
02:53:57.130 --> 02:54:01.360
but there are uncountable numbers of situations like that where massive

2928
02:54:01.420 --> 02:54:06.380
suffering a cruise.
And it's not because it was an evil person,
uh,

2929
02:54:07.050 --> 02:54:07.720
intend to,
yeah.
And

2930
02:54:07.720 --> 02:54:10.800
<v 2>upon causing that suffering,
I agree 100%.
I think there's an either or.</v>

2931
02:54:11.130 --> 02:54:13.620
I think you gotta be able to look at both sides.
There's an either or,

2932
02:54:13.700 --> 02:54:16.080
but there's a lot of evil fuckers out there.
They're doing some creepy shit.

2933
02:54:16.350 --> 02:54:20.040
No doubt.
Well,
at least one,
at least 1% of us are,
are,
uh,

2934
02:54:20.790 --> 02:54:24.960
psychopaths.
So three hours just flew by.
Wow.
That was three hours status.

2935
02:54:25.140 --> 02:54:27.330
That was fun.
That's a faster hours.
Yeah,
it was really enjoyable.

02:54:27.660 --> 02:54:32.340
