00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Don't just go out there and buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

29
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:16.600
<v Speaker 1>but if you're interested in our stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a full spectrum neutral.</v>

30
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.730
<v Speaker 1>It's all balanced out and explained </v>

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.451
<v Speaker 1>scientific details we can.</v>

<v Speaker 1>if it's not,</v>

34
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 1>the other option I think was university </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Australia,</v>

35
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>one of the universities in Australia </v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work.</v>

36
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Columbus state to find some closure </v>
<v Speaker 1>option.</v>

37
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:44.271
<v Speaker 1>We're going to Australia find some </v>
<v Speaker 1>Komodo island dudes that are selling </v>

38
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:44.970

<v Speaker 1>but when you go through the do anything,</v>

42
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>the money back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not worth it.</v>

55
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>I just always ask a doctor whenever it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives me something.</v>

56
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>There are certain nutrients that they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered,</v>

57
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>had some head trauma.</v>

59
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>That was what a Roman ascii stuff was </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on.</v>

60
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:37.190
<v Speaker 1>I know you're a big football fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Roman ask.</v>

61
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>He has his own very similar line of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff.</v>

62
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:44.931
<v Speaker 1>He's got something called neuro one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I also like and maybe some people </v>

63
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.900
<v Speaker 1>might like even better than Alpha brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a drink and you'll like it.</v>

64
00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>You could just mix it up like some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't like swallowing pills.</v>

65
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take two Alpha brains and I'm </v>

66
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 1>straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

67
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.340
<v Speaker 1>You like it up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just for giggles and were just first </v>

69
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.200
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Shit's bad than the good surprises.</v>

70
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I never did this positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

71
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.130
<v Speaker 1>I met Romanowski in Denver with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Broncos retraining and Haley Colorado </v>

72
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.040
<v Speaker 1>and they told me I wanted to interview </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

73
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I said the show called off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was essentially.</v>

74
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

75
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>And they said you don't want an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview with bill.</v>

76
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.580
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

77
00:03:16.581 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we got to lunch.</v>

78
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>The whole place is filled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a table for eight.</v>

79
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.310
<v Speaker 1>It's empty with just him sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not crazy because nobody wanted to </v>

80
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.310
<v Speaker 1>eat lunch with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

81
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to him subsequently saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds cool man.</v>

82
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 1>The dude had a ton of concussions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

83
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.740
<v Speaker 1>a ton of concussions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the reason why he created </v>

84
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.561
<v Speaker 1>this neuro Juana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched a whole interview with him </v>

85
00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:40.561
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating stuff.</v>

86
00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:44.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy realized that he was having </v>

87
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.670
<v Speaker 1>problems and he tried to counteract that</v>
<v Speaker 1>with nutrients.</v>

88
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.830
<v Speaker 1>And so that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was taught this by a first exposed to </v>

89
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.660

00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:07.220
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take as Adopolis.</v>

118
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I take a lot of like healthy live </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures and I absolutely know for a </v>

119
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 1>fact by my own personal experience that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's enhanced my life.</v>

120
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Was the guy that just had an astronomy </v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwich can put that shit away.</v>

121
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I put that shit away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

122
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm going to do kettle bells two</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

123
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.660
<v Speaker 1>What's a head toothpaste that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have these giant iron cannonballs that</v>

124
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>swing around.</v>

125
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I got to show it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll love it.</v>

126
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.300
<v Speaker 1>So craziest exercise ever is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian strength training where you,</v>

127
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:39.301
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're swinging around these fucking </v>

128
00:05:39.301 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>giant cannon balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every movement is a compound movement</v>

129
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:43.030
<v Speaker 1>that requires your whole body to work as</v>
<v Speaker 1>one unit.</v>

130
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 1>So it transfers very well athletically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

131
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:48.570
<v Speaker 1>did you Jitsu or to football or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

132
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a good basketball player.</v>

133
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 1>It would transfer even at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's kettlebells,</v>

134
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:56.610
<v Speaker 1>like one of the best exercises I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>used ever.</v>

135
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>So fucking it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great way to work out.</v>

136
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>It's brutal and you can get done in 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

137
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.630
<v Speaker 1>You can just blow it out in 20 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're fucking wrecked for two </v>

138
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.630
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

139
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a good exercise.</v>

140
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping maybe we just shoot a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little pool buddy.</v>

141
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do that for sure.</v>

142
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the commercial on a.com.</v>

143
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Go check out Alpha brain checkout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a shroom tech sport which is a a</v>

144
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:27.341
<v Speaker 1>quarter steps mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be 12 and a bunch of other stuff in </v>

145
00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:30.250
<v Speaker 1>their supplement for endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which cordyceps mushroom is.</v>

146
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.430
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a nutrient that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>started eating at high altitudes and </v>

147
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.801
<v Speaker 1>help them deal with the lack of oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they believed that it helps in </v>

148
00:06:38.801 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>difference and especially when combined </v>
<v Speaker 1>with be 12 people love it.</v>

149
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Jujitsu guys love the shroom </v>
<v Speaker 1>tech sport.</v>

150
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:49.031
<v Speaker 1>I get that all the time and shroom tech </v>
<v Speaker 1>immune is another one that's also a </v>

151
00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 1>mushroom based supplement that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhances your immune system.</v>

152
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 1>So fascinating concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way it works,</v>

153
00:06:53.631 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>being that it tricks your body into </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

154
00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:01.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your body fires up a domain system </v>

155
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.911
<v Speaker 1>for a fight that never takes place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coca leaves before I go into the </v>

156
00:07:03.911 --> 00:07:03.911
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood hills.</v>

157
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a good move because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>altitude.</v>

158
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 1>You get those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know go.</v>

<v Speaker 1>If you have a greenhouse at work and </v>

162
00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:16.361

165
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Coke in the third world.</v>

<v Speaker 1>paid to see before I got into comedy.</v>

205
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I was a huge fan and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

206
00:09:35.421 --> 00:09:37.280
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love standup comedy.</v>

207
00:09:37.281 --> 00:09:41.780
<v Speaker 1>I loved watching evening at the Improv </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I took a date to the,</v>

00:09:49.871 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>like maybe once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I might not have even.</v>

211
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:55.420
<v Speaker 1>It might've even been before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember I watched there and one </v>

212
00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.720
<v Speaker 1>of the things you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

213
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:57.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

214
00:09:57.531 --> 00:09:58.490
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>

215
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:03.580
<v Speaker 1>you fucking killed and you were one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the few guys that could survive that </v>

216
00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.690
<v Speaker 1>crazy Boston gauntlet that they used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw it on the national head,</v>

217
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.660
<v Speaker 1>but they liked me and so everybody loved</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

218
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.840
<v Speaker 1>But it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a tricky situation that Boston </v>

219
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.931
<v Speaker 1>gauntlet taste through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would take a guy like billy crystal </v>

220
00:10:16.931 --> 00:10:17.420
<v Speaker 1>would come into town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

221
00:10:17.421 --> 00:10:22.421
<v Speaker 1>And they would make billy crystal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would purposely put up the best </v>

222
00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:23.900
<v Speaker 1>local guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Sweeney,</v>

223
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Don Gavin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenny,</v>

224
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Kenny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody would go up with 15 minutes.</v>

225
00:10:29.811 --> 00:10:34.811
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking fury to short sets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to do 50 at the end and </v>

226
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:35.690
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

227
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.890
<v Speaker 1>at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But first of all,</v>

228
00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:41.630
<v Speaker 1>they've made everyone laugh with every </v>
<v Speaker 1>local reference humanly possible.</v>

229
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.940
<v Speaker 1>And if there's anything people love in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston,</v>

230
00:10:43.941 --> 00:10:45.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a Boston joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem.</v>

231
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:51.100
<v Speaker 1>I had like my first 20 minutes all </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolved around Boston because when </v>

232
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.311
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're fucking sinking out there </v>

233
00:10:54.311 --> 00:10:56.741
<v Speaker 1>and you're looking for some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that you could make fun of a </v>

234
00:10:56.741 --> 00:10:56.741
<v Speaker 1>girl from revere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has big hair.</v>

235
00:10:56.741 --> 00:10:56.741
<v Speaker 1>That's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in my.</v>

236
00:10:56.741 --> 00:10:57.530
<v Speaker 1>It's in my wheelhouse.</v>

237
00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:58.600
<v Speaker 1>I can pull that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

238
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.130
<v Speaker 1>you could always go with like local </v>
<v Speaker 1>Charleston,</v>

239
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.110
<v Speaker 1>the Irish girls and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

240
00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:03.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

241
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:04.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was.</v>

242
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.420
<v Speaker 1>There's always something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

243
00:11:05.421 --> 00:11:09.230
<v Speaker 1>and then you're in Japan after dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>

244
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could.</v>

245
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.060
<v Speaker 1>You could do like local jokes and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>survived.</v>

246
00:11:14.061 --> 00:11:15.860
<v Speaker 1>You survived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're one of the few guys.</v>

247
00:11:15.861 --> 00:11:18.380
<v Speaker 1>I saw a lot of guys eat up fat bag of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dicks.</v>

248
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I heard Richard Lewis hid under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage afterwards.</v>

249
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard.</v>

250
00:11:21.801 --> 00:11:23.050
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

251
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that a few times with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

252
00:11:25.281 --> 00:11:28.760
<v Speaker 1>He's apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he doesn't get like his crowd,</v>

253
00:11:28.761 --> 00:11:33.761
<v Speaker 1>like he has a very specific crowd that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like comes up to see them and sometimes </v>

254
00:11:33.761 --> 00:11:38.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people maybe don't know what he's going </v>

255
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:38.170
<v Speaker 1>to do before he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they do,</v>

256
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:38.570
<v Speaker 1>they love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love that character.</v>

257
00:11:38.571 --> 00:11:41.360
<v Speaker 1>But if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think from what I've heard,</v>

258
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.100
<v Speaker 1>it can go bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine.</v>

259
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Remember Nick's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick's was the place where you saw me </v>

260
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:52.240
<v Speaker 1>and that was really a tough club and </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the third show in Friday </v>

261
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.390
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I asked Jonathan Katz due to show </v>

262
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:55.390
<v Speaker 1>with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:55.390
<v Speaker 1>how Jonathan</v>

264
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Speaker 3>is very nebbishy and little Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian versus a hosted my first open.</v>

265
00:11:58.901 --> 00:11:59.580
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was he?</v>

266
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was nice.</v>

267
00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.210
<v Speaker 3>Theoretical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

268
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

269
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said John did a show at me.</v>

270
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:04.690
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

271
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:05.560
<v Speaker 3>I can't go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

272
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll protect you.</v>

273
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:07.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch your back.</v>

274
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:12.750
<v Speaker 3>She goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually started heckling the back </v>

275
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.100
<v Speaker 3>of his bald head before he got to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage for nothing.</v>

276
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 3>He didn't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes up,</v>

277
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.170
<v Speaker 3>it goes a precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just walks off the stage.</v>

278
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 3>They booed him before he talked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the.</v>

279
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Boston was an interesting mix of college</v>
<v Speaker 3>educated people and savages.</v>

280
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:31.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

281
00:12:31.891 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is one of the,</v>

282
00:12:33.491 --> 00:12:38.491
<v Speaker 3>it has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think has the highest amount of </v>

283
00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:40.381
<v Speaker 3>colleges per capita in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I couldn't get in any of them in </v>

284
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.990
<v Speaker 3>our.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to see street fights there when,</v>

285
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.130
<v Speaker 3>when you didn't see them anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see guys,</v>

286
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:48.760
<v Speaker 3>they didn't go home and work at a tie </v>
<v Speaker 3>white shirt hanging out.</v>

287
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Battling each other.</v>

288
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.590
<v Speaker 3>There's still fights in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boston dudes will still fight.</v>

289
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.010
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the few places where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably not going to get shot.</v>

290
00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:02.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually want to duke it out with </v>

291
00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get stomped.</v>

292
00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could get shot though.</v>

293
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.820
<v Speaker 3>Everyone has baseball bats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one plays bass with the wrong </v>

294
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:09.580
<v Speaker 3>kids from south that you could get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody get shot there too.</v>

295
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.480
<v Speaker 3>But you do definitely see like more </v>
<v Speaker 3>fistfights there.</v>

296
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:17.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always think of you as in New York </v>

297
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 3>while I was born in Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

298
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean I got better in New York when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was in,</v>

299
00:13:20.561 --> 00:13:25.561
<v Speaker 3>but I developed in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was only there for four years </v>

300
00:13:25.561 --> 00:13:26.300
<v Speaker 3>doing stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

301
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.510
<v Speaker 3>I moved to New York only four years into</v>
<v Speaker 3>my act was.</v>

302
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.820
<v Speaker 3>And I got a manager so that my manager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's still my manager,</v>

303
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.000
<v Speaker 3>so state it was selling me as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>headliner,</v>

304
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.530
<v Speaker 3>but I wasn't really a headliner yet.</v>

305
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 3>You didn't have the minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You probably had the talent.</v>

306
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:45.520
<v Speaker 3>But I had a good solid 15 to 40 if the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground was right.</v>

307
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.590
<v Speaker 3>Remember the first time this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hiram cast and crew,</v>

308
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.350
<v Speaker 3>I remember that guy got me a Gig for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>$75.</v>

309
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.660
<v Speaker 3>I had to do 45 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said I only have 25.</v>

310
00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:56.740
<v Speaker 3>He goes like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

311
00:13:56.741 --> 00:14:00.310
<v Speaker 3>like Jesus with the fishes that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go out there and do it.</v>

312
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:03.170
<v Speaker 3>It will come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will come unto thee.</v>

313
00:14:03.171 --> 00:14:07.600
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if it came you crowd </v>
<v Speaker 3>work because I didn't have the time.</v>

314
00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are silly days.</v>

315
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.520
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe people can do 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

316
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.960
<v Speaker 3>When I had five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got up 20 minutes in a row.</v>

317
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.630
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the longest flat out set of?</v>

318
00:14:19.631 --> 00:14:23.410
<v Speaker 3>Just stand up you've ever done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a real good at real long.</v>

319
00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.240
<v Speaker 3>I probably an hour and a half.</v>

320
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.100
<v Speaker 3>That's about all you should do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

321
00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:31.150
<v Speaker 3>I think I love a 45 minutes set crusher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

322
00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Just get off one them wanting more </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of.</v>

323
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:35.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done long.</v>

324
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.920
<v Speaker 3>I've done too long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to do these q and a's at the end </v>

325
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:40.920
<v Speaker 3>of my shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

326
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.900
<v Speaker 3>but that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that goes into some.</v>

<v Speaker 3>used to do the people were falling </v>

<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

559
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.920
<v Speaker 4>It was a great community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a great comedian.</v>

560
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.670
<v Speaker 4>Did Ed smell like Daniel isn't even one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the most underrated guys,</v>

561
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:15.730

<v Speaker 4>If you go back to the people wouldn't </v>

562
00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:15.730
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they'd know they'd go,</v>

566
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.380
<v Speaker 4>how strong his act was in the late </v>
<v Speaker 4>eighties,</v>

567
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:23.870
<v Speaker 4>the late eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the eighties.</v>

568
00:24:23.871 --> 00:24:26.120
<v Speaker 4>Like in the early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would go,</v>

569
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:29.670
<v Speaker 4>he went to East side comedy club and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they said he did a,</v>

570
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.840
<v Speaker 4>he did three different shows in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three complete different hours,</v>

571
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.240
<v Speaker 4>completely different from beginning to </v>
<v Speaker 4>end.</v>

572
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:41.100
<v Speaker 4>And he was mad at me for like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>15 years because when he started out he </v>

573
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:45.881
<v Speaker 4>only had 25 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of us and I had to cover for </v>

<v Speaker 4>he would,</v>

577
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.600
<v Speaker 4>we used to say we'd squirrel his money </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the daytime.</v>

578
00:24:53.601 --> 00:24:58.601
<v Speaker 4>We would buy all the food for the place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then he buys chicks it not buy drinks </v>

579
00:24:58.601 --> 00:25:02.441
<v Speaker 4>for chicks at night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we started calling them squirrel </v>

580
00:25:02.441 --> 00:25:02.860
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just like normal ball Boston,</v>

581
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.930
<v Speaker 4>like very mild hazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he took it real seriously and he was</v>

582
00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:08.600
<v Speaker 4>hurt and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was mad for years ago.</v>

583
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.890

<v Speaker 4>we're just kidding.</v>

584
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:10.720
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

585
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:11.910
<v Speaker 4>he was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

586
00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:17.260
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so psychotic that he was in that </v>

587
00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:17.510
<v Speaker 4>kind of pain that he would shoot </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself.</v>

588
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:18.520
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:23.640
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did see symptoms of incredible </v>

590
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.500
<v Speaker 4>insecurity and incredible holding onto </v>

604
00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:54.550
<v Speaker 4>oprah thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when did that start happening?</v>

605
00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:59.580
<v Speaker 4>Since I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since I was really bandon than the </v>

606
00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.360
<v Speaker 4>yellowstone national park,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was abandoned in the Grand Canyon.</v>

607
00:26:02.361 --> 00:26:04.660
<v Speaker 4>So I have a fear of widths.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

608
00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:05.850
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

610
00:26:07.341 --> 00:26:08.480
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always had.</v>

611
00:26:08.481 --> 00:26:10.320
<v Speaker 4>And you don't have any neurotic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were up in bay,</v>

612
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:11.780
<v Speaker 4>you weren't really abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

613
00:26:11.781 --> 00:26:13.250
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just a joke.</v>

614
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.650
<v Speaker 4>It's not even a joke because the joke </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be funny.</v>

615
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:20.610
<v Speaker 4>That was kind of shocking stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>

616
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:25.400
<v Speaker 4>I would start laughing because I thought</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were like underneath that tree and I</v>

617
00:26:25.401 --> 00:26:30.401
<v Speaker 4>was thinking about little squirrels </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming up and kissing you and try to </v>

618
00:26:30.401 --> 00:26:30.401
<v Speaker 4>web.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

619
00:26:30.401 --> 00:26:34.240
<v Speaker 4>I read this story recently about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy who got killed by a bear real </v>

620
00:26:34.491 --> 00:26:37.250
<v Speaker 4>recently and they had a track down bed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did it?</v>

621
00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:42.260
<v Speaker 4>It's happened twice in the last year and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the in in yellowstone,</v>

622
00:26:42.261 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 4>and it had to before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since the</v>

623
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.110
<v Speaker 1>19 eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty uncommon,</v>

624
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.740
<v Speaker 1>but this one unfortunately wasn't just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill.</v>

625
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.400
<v Speaker 1>They had eaten part of this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you got to kill that bear.</v>

626
00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:58.660
<v Speaker 1>That's a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's discovered that human beings are </v>

627
00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.071
<v Speaker 1>a food source and delicious by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And easy to remember eating sophie out.</v>

628
00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:05.940
<v Speaker 5>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hello?</v>

629
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.660

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.310

<v Speaker 1>so it's the same thing.</v>

631
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Don't make you gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's a bear.</v>

633
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Nevermind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the.</v>

634
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.190
<v Speaker 1>They had to track this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pared down and kill it,</v>

635
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.570
<v Speaker 1>and they're all tagged anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

636
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:24.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

637
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:25.120
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>

638
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.040
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they've got them all.</v>

639
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

640
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:35.110
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is this one wild area that people </v>

641
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:38.411
<v Speaker 1>venture into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's this huge dog things that </v>

642
00:27:38.411 --> 00:27:42.371
<v Speaker 1>will occasionally fucking eat you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they catch you with their </v>

643
00:27:42.371 --> 00:27:42.980
<v Speaker 1>cubs when they're with their cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get,</v>

644
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.300
<v Speaker 1>they get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

645
00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:49.320
<v Speaker 1>what were you telling me before about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy that beat up and killed all </v>

646
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.030
<v Speaker 1>those bulls?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's crazy about one significant night</v>

647
00:27:50.031 --> 00:27:51.360
<v Speaker 1>in your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

648
00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:52.520
<v Speaker 1>He knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody says,</v>

649
00:27:52.521 --> 00:27:53.120
<v Speaker 1>I got a story.</v>

650
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.920
<v Speaker 1>You got a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you this.</v>

651
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say the exact right number,</v>

652
00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:03.100
<v Speaker 1>but I think it was something like 11 </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead wolves and he had shot a bunch of </v>

653
00:28:03.711 --> 00:28:08.711
<v Speaker 1>them and then he had a apparently a run </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of bullets or as gun jammed and then</v>

654
00:28:10.761 --> 00:28:13.090
<v Speaker 1>he beat a bunch of them to death with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his butt.</v>

655
00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:18.480
<v Speaker 1>So they found him and like 11 dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves and then eventually the wolves </v>

656
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.410
<v Speaker 1>got them the rest of the pack killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

657
00:28:19.411 --> 00:28:20.810
<v Speaker 1>they did get him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

658
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:21.830
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

659
00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.830
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe I said a lot.</v>

660
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I said Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might've been wrong.</v>

661
00:28:25.701 --> 00:28:28.610
<v Speaker 1>It might've been Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many wolves were in that pack?</v>

662
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:29.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

663
00:28:29.901 --> 00:28:33.060
<v Speaker 1>There could be 100 and another five or </v>
<v Speaker 1>six.</v>

664
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they're like 30 or 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there had been super pacs cited </v>

665
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:43.001
<v Speaker 1>recently in Russia that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really getting scared of that </v>

666
00:28:43.001 --> 00:28:46.800
<v Speaker 1>were in the hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's funny about that is they're </v>

667
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.690
<v Speaker 1>all starving to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no fucking food out there.</v>

668
00:28:47.691 --> 00:28:49.370
<v Speaker 1>So they're sneaking into these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

672
00:28:58.251 --> 00:29:00.230

<v Speaker 1>in a mass swoop.</v>

673

<v Speaker 5>400 of them.</v>

680
00:29:23.601 --> 00:29:28.601
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine 400 fucking walls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that feeling of being trapped in your </v>

681
00:29:29.301 --> 00:29:34.301
<v Speaker 5>house with 400 wolves out there and they</v>

<v Speaker 1>I finally told them why they didn't come</v>

685
00:29:44.231 --> 00:29:47.470
<v Speaker 1>over his house because I was afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his pit bulls and you know,</v>

686
00:29:47.471 --> 00:29:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I know that all I pictured was the bull </v>
<v Speaker 1>flying through the air and latching onto</v>

687
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.270
<v Speaker 1>my juggler and Joe's screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never did this before.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember you have to worry about one.</v>

693
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:14.270
<v Speaker 1>I had to have a bar welded around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perimeter of the fence because he </v>

694
00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:17.191
<v Speaker 1>figured out that he could get his head </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and bend the bars just by sheer </v>

695
00:30:17.191 --> 00:30:18.220
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

696
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:22.750
<v Speaker 1>He had his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any animals that we either so crazy.</v>

697
00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:27.760
<v Speaker 1>The kids that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine your little girl and then it </v>

698
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:27.760
<v Speaker 1>burned.</v>

699
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.770
<v Speaker 1>I spoken to her in the eye and the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

700
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:31.330
<v Speaker 1>I agree with kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very dangerous,</v>

701
00:30:31.331 --> 00:30:33.220
<v Speaker 1>especially if they don't grow up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids.</v>

702
00:30:33.221 --> 00:30:38.221
<v Speaker 1>If they're not a baby with the kids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get jealous is that they get </v>

703
00:30:38.221 --> 00:30:41.161
<v Speaker 1>jealous and also they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't think of it necessarily as a </v>

704
00:30:41.161 --> 00:30:41.161
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's small.</v>

705
00:30:41.161 --> 00:30:43.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing and they might </v>
<v Speaker 1>bite it,</v>

706
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:44.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

707
00:30:44.241 --> 00:30:44.650
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

708
00:30:44.651 --> 00:30:46.210
<v Speaker 1>that is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it annoys them,</v>

709
00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:47.310
<v Speaker 1>they might bite it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

710
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.210
<v Speaker 1>in a way that they would never bite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

711
00:30:49.211 --> 00:30:51.190
<v Speaker 1>but they might buy the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

712
00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:57.110
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dangerous at any dog is </v>

713
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.760
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not trained properly and especially</v>

714
00:30:57.761 --> 00:31:02.761
<v Speaker 1>dogs with a high prey drive except,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're so fun to be around.</v>

715
00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:08.790
<v Speaker 1>They're so friendly and loyal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>energetic and they're so happy to see </v>

716
00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:09.580
<v Speaker 1>you and they're so smart.</v>

717
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:14.580
<v Speaker 1>They're so smart dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately all that intelligence </v>

718
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:18.421
<v Speaker 1>comes with a burden and the burden is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they are ultra dogs and the way </v>

719
00:31:18.421 --> 00:31:20.020
<v Speaker 1>they became ultra dogs as they raised </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

720
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.530
<v Speaker 1>fighting each other and they killed all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that weren't superior.</v>

721
00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.270
<v Speaker 1>They really just kept a strong blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines,</v>

722
00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:31.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you get a dog that's like a real </v>

723
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.121
<v Speaker 1>fighting dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are some of the smartest dogs </v>

724
00:31:33.121 --> 00:31:35.041
<v Speaker 1>you'll ever have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bryan county used to have this pit bull </v>

725
00:31:35.041 --> 00:31:38.310
<v Speaker 1>and it was like a direct fighting dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We bought it from a dude who fought </v>

726
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.160
<v Speaker 1>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there with him.</v>

727
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:44.520
<v Speaker 1>We went and this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would gamble on dog fighting and </v>

728
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.010
<v Speaker 1>the guy was explaining to us that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs don't die and he's like,</v>

729
00:31:45.011 --> 00:31:47.230
<v Speaker 1>you don't let your dog get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

730
00:31:47.231 --> 00:31:50.050
<v Speaker 1>it's all about gambling and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>about breeding.</v>

731
00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:55.080
<v Speaker 1>The pitfalls that it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had been doing this for generation </v>

732
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.440
<v Speaker 1>upon generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently I bought some.</v>

733
00:31:56.441 --> 00:31:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Michael Vick was saying that it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural thing.</v>

734
00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy that.</v>

735
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Yield a lot of them by electrocuting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

736
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.020
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the dark side of it is that they,</v>

737
00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.690
<v Speaker 1>they take these animals after they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

738
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.240
<v Speaker 1>got to fuck each other up and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot.</v>

739
00:32:13.241 --> 00:32:14.440
<v Speaker 1>One of them were killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them,</v>

740
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.140
<v Speaker 1>the one that quit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even want them to breed.</v>

741
00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.960
<v Speaker 1>He got scared and turned away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other dog.</v>

742
00:32:19.961 --> 00:32:24.961
<v Speaker 1>They don't even want them to breed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want them to just fight </v>

743
00:32:24.961 --> 00:32:25.930
<v Speaker 1>mercilessly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight until somebody pulls them off.</v>

744
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.300
<v Speaker 1>It's just a fucked up thing to breed </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a dog.</v>

745
00:32:28.301 --> 00:32:30.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucked up behavior trait to </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathe in.</v>

746
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:34.330
<v Speaker 1>There's this old frail lady in Burbank </v>
<v Speaker 1>and walks her pit bulls,</v>

747
00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.360
<v Speaker 1>two of them every day and every time I </v>
<v Speaker 1>see it I'm like,</v>

748
00:32:37.361 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 1>that's not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have at least be able</v>

749
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.980
<v Speaker 3>to like if something happened to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>care of it and that slap it with the </v>

750
00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:46.150
<v Speaker 3>white glove and not every pit bull will </v>
<v Speaker 3>freak out.</v>

751
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:51.220
<v Speaker 3>Fuck other dogs up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some pit bulls are very well socialized </v>

752
00:32:52.491 --> 00:32:55.730
<v Speaker 3>and well trained and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're exercised well so they're,</v>

753
00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get tired out and that's the </v>

754
00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:00.760
<v Speaker 3>important thing with dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two dogs are just like people,</v>

755
00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:01.460
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got throw the ball for the dog,</v>

756
00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta give the dog some space,</v>

757
00:33:03.471 --> 00:33:08.471
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dogs have a big yard to run around </v>

758
00:33:08.471 --> 00:33:08.471
<v Speaker 3>and it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need that man.</v>

759
00:33:08.471 --> 00:33:09.200
<v Speaker 3>Dogs need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they need to be able to,</v>

760
00:33:09.201 --> 00:33:11.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to just to blow off some steam.</v>

761
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:13.460
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise their tents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

762
00:33:13.461 --> 00:33:18.461
<v Speaker 3>a dog into the house all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't get to get out of those dogs </v>

763
00:33:18.461 --> 00:33:18.461
<v Speaker 3>will bark and jump up in the air.</v>

764
00:33:18.461 --> 00:33:18.710
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

765
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.380
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you keep me and locked them in a box all</v>

766
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.160
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a dog.</v>

767
00:33:22.161 --> 00:33:24.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm supposed to be out running around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

768
00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:26.300
<v Speaker 3>So if you have two pitbulls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

769
00:33:26.301 --> 00:33:31.301
<v Speaker 3>you better make sure that you put those </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuckers through a good little workout </v>

770
00:33:31.301 --> 00:33:31.860
<v Speaker 3>routine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to start bringing my dog here and</v>

771
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:36.080
<v Speaker 3>kind of dog just sits there and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's gay and dog.</v>

773
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.190
<v Speaker 3>He actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he sees me he goes,</v>

774
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.010
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

775
00:33:45.011 --> 00:33:46.820
<v Speaker 3>like real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that fucker good?</v>

776
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved this gut,</v>

777
00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:49.160
<v Speaker 3>but I mean really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

780
00:33:51.921 --> 00:33:54.650

<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

781
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:57.620
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet dogs are beautiful like that.</v>

782
00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.030
<v Speaker 3>That's why people like having them as </v>
<v Speaker 3>pets or people talking about having like</v>

783
00:34:01.031 --> 00:34:02.150
<v Speaker 3>a pet bird or something.</v>

784
00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stupid snake.</v>

785
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get up by the paradigm.</v>

786
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.980
<v Speaker 3>I went through a phase for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just saw.</v>

787
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:12.140
<v Speaker 3>I met a really cool pair and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so beautiful.</v>

788
00:34:12.141 --> 00:34:16.450
<v Speaker 3>I want that in my bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And look,</v>

789

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

790
00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:24.770
<v Speaker 3>my shoulder and I had a baseball hat on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he bit the little top button off the</v>

791
00:34:25.311 --> 00:34:26.430
<v Speaker 3>top of the handles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

792
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:28.610
<v Speaker 3>that'd be fun to have around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:34.420
<v Speaker 3>I didn't buy one had claws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust anything with claws.</v>

794
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.560
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

795
00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:40.390
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.700
<v Speaker 3>they've uncovered of the biggest bird </v>
<v Speaker 3>that ever lived.</v>

799
00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:56.050
<v Speaker 3>It was 30 feet long and weighed 3000 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>

800
00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:00.640
<v Speaker 3>It's giant fucking predatory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The monster is grey goose chases.</v>

801
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.360
<v Speaker 3>Birds Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

802
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:03.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's 30 feet long,</v>

803
00:35:03.981 --> 00:35:06.530
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're asking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a burden.</v>

804
00:35:06.531 --> 00:35:07.610
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

805
00:35:07.611 --> 00:35:09.950
<v Speaker 3>it's covered in feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really fucked.</v>

806
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.130
<v Speaker 3>Or dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't they scale.</v>

807
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:16.670
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they were scales and we just suck </v>

<v Speaker 7>dude.</v>

926
00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:28.060
<v Speaker 7>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was just sitting there going,</v>

927
00:40:28.061 --> 00:40:33.061
<v Speaker 7>what the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you gotta think who these people </v>

928
00:40:33.061 --> 00:40:33.061
<v Speaker 7>are.</v>

929
00:40:33.061 --> 00:40:33.240
<v Speaker 7>People their stockers or professional </v>
<v Speaker 7>stalkers.</v>

930
00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:34.960
<v Speaker 7>They're fun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're terrifying.</v>

931
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.810
<v Speaker 7>Those guys are terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're also,</v>

932
00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:40.150
<v Speaker 7>I think they have to fortify because a </v>
<v Speaker 7>lot of people like lash out at them.</v>

933
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:41.130
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know.</v>

934
00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:46.410
<v Speaker 7>Well now I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you mentioned being in Lindsay </v>

935
00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:46.410
<v Speaker 7>Lohan.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

936
00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:46.410
<v Speaker 7>or somebody like that and just have that</v>
<v Speaker 7>shit happened to them.</v>

937
00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:50.080
<v Speaker 7>That's scary about it is a better at </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

938
00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:55.110
<v Speaker 7>What would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why I think the aids blood thing </v>

939
00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:55.110
<v Speaker 7>I was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you had aids blend just started like</v>

940
00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:55.540
<v Speaker 7>going in and around.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Really.</v>

941
00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.940
<v Speaker 7>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think it should be legal to have</v>

942
00:40:57.941 --> 00:41:02.941
<v Speaker 7>a gang of people just standing out there</v>
<v Speaker 7>with a camera and photographing someone </v>

943
00:41:02.941 --> 00:41:06.361
<v Speaker 7>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Freaking people out and especially when </v>

944
00:41:06.361 --> 00:41:06.520
<v Speaker 7>they're walking into traffic like that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like that should be something you should</v>

945
00:41:06.521 --> 00:41:09.070
<v Speaker 7>be able to get in trouble for.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It seems like,</v>

946
00:41:09.071 --> 00:41:10.840
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you want to go bust pot shops,</v>

947
00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:16.050
<v Speaker 7>pop shops are hurting anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 7>These guys are walking in traffic and </v>

948
00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:19.591
<v Speaker 7>big giant groups from freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Some chick it less and here's the big </v>

949
00:41:19.591 --> 00:41:23.740
<v Speaker 7>and less the real and less and less.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She set it all up and that's exactly </v>

950
00:41:24.131 --> 00:41:26.260
<v Speaker 7>what I was thinking too because it was </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

951
00:41:26.261 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 7>why is this one e five people and none </v>
<v Speaker 7>of us knew who this girl is.</v>

952
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.630
<v Speaker 7>I think that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>

953
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:33.440
<v Speaker 7>everybody's got to grind out of.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't.</v>

954
00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to hit a</v>

955
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.980
<v Speaker 1>guy trying to make a living if the west </v>
<v Speaker 1>wait and make a living as taking </v>

956
00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:39.320
<v Speaker 1>pictures of Eva Mendez or whoever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it is,</v>

957
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:44.470
<v Speaker 1>as long as they're not really harassing </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and I don't think they offer for </v>

958
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.470
<v Speaker 1>the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it.</v>

959
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:48.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a few that'll mean like clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>when Brittany spears was going bonkers </v>

960
00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:52.370
<v Speaker 1>and shaving her head and running around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and beat and cars with a umbrella.</v>

961
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Clearly they were just following her </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

962
00:41:54.991 --> 00:41:56.900
<v Speaker 1>There was no agreements there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

963
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:59.780
<v Speaker 1>let's follow this crazy bitch all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's about to do something.</v>

964
00:41:59.781 --> 00:42:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

965
00:42:00.681 --> 00:42:02.150
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is easy pickins,</v>

966
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:07.390
<v Speaker 1>but I know for a fact that people set up</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake situations where they tell someone </v>

967
00:42:10.131 --> 00:42:15.131
<v Speaker 1>a Po,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a publicists will set it up with the </v>

<v Speaker 1>so the proper.</v>

969
00:42:15.131 --> 00:42:17.240
<v Speaker 1>It waits for them so they make it look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a big deal.</v>

970
00:42:17.241 --> 00:42:17.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

971
00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.590
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're everywhere.</v>

972
00:42:18.591 --> 00:42:19.940

<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do?</v>

973
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile they're fucking asking for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're setting it up.</v>

974
00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

975

<v Speaker 1>let's be famous thing.</v>

976
00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.190
<v Speaker 7>It was scary though.</v>

<v Speaker 7>in their car and it was just like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 7>people around the car.</v>

980
00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:44.070
<v Speaker 7>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>come on and get the fuck away from my </v>

981
00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:44.070

<v Speaker 7>there's just like touching your car and </v>
<v Speaker 7>shit and then that would dub and there's</v>

<v Speaker 7>so much flashes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How are you even being able to see when </v>

984
00:42:52.591 --> 00:42:52.690
<v Speaker 7>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're trying to pull out into traffic.</v>

985
00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.850
<v Speaker 7>The flashes alone,</v>
<v Speaker 7>those people,</v>

986
00:42:54.851 --> 00:42:58.780
<v Speaker 7>any flashbulbs going off,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all those people should be like tickets.</v>

987
00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.020
<v Speaker 7>Like if there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's like saying that's like trying to</v>

988
00:43:02.021 --> 00:43:06.040
<v Speaker 7>distract somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fuck texting flash bulbs in your fucking</v>

989
00:43:06.041 --> 00:43:08.000
<v Speaker 7>face.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well it's definitely just the</v>

990
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:13.060
<v Speaker 1>giant mass of people that you say or </v>
<v Speaker 1>blocking the traffic you shouldn't be </v>

991
00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:13.060
<v Speaker 1>able to do.</v>

992
00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:14.930
<v Speaker 7>Would you ever want Lindsay Lohan on a </v>
<v Speaker 7>podcast?</v>

993
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:20.110
<v Speaker 7>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it'd be interesting to talk to </v>

994
00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:21.971
<v Speaker 7>her.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think she thought I liked the skanky </v>

995
00:43:21.971 --> 00:43:21.971
<v Speaker 7>blonde look.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

996
00:43:21.971 --> 00:43:23.060
<v Speaker 7>she's got a beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a redhead again,</v>

997
00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.600
<v Speaker 7>but then when she was blonde and it was </v>
<v Speaker 7>obviously a little girl,</v>

998
00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.810
<v Speaker 7>she still to stay redhead,</v>
<v Speaker 7>she might be the hottest.</v>

999
00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:35.140
<v Speaker 7>So I contention about a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 7>celebrities when Michael Jordan was at </v>

1000
00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:38.170
<v Speaker 7>his peak and I really believe that they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they don't,</v>

1001
00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.850
<v Speaker 7>they find people annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but if they weren't,</v>

1002
00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:45.010
<v Speaker 7>they weren't recognized.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They feel insecure during a moment.</v>

1003
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.660
<v Speaker 7>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't bother me right now you think,</v>

1004
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.250
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people,</v>

1005
00:43:49.251 --> 00:43:50.330
<v Speaker 1>they definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1006
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:53.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like being recognized is a big part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it for them.</v>

1007
00:43:53.691 --> 00:43:56.960
<v Speaker 1>It gives them a charge when they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and they get recognized,</v>

1008
00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:58.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>

1039
00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:14.100
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that wish they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were funny.</v>

1040
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.680
<v Speaker 4>It a lot of like really stayed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people think they're funny,</v>

1041
00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:22.440
<v Speaker 4>some people think they're funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of people that wish </v>

1042
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.681
<v Speaker 4>they were and just for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't figure out how to how to do </v>

1043
00:45:24.681 --> 00:45:24.681
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1045
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:28.890
<v Speaker 4>I think that's diluted a lot of times </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there was a guy,</v>

1046
00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:29.400
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1047
00:45:29.401 --> 00:45:30.840
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to be a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1048
00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:32.750
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 4>what if you're not funny?</v>

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:43.550
<v Speaker 4>How can you be a comedian when we know a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of comedians that aren't funny but </v>

1054
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:47.601
<v Speaker 4>they're successful because they know </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the tricks and they're good </v>

1055
00:45:47.601 --> 00:45:47.630
<v Speaker 4>looking or they're good at marketing </v>

<v Speaker 4>This is a lot of people that get to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain level and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 7>You let things slide more I guess.</v>

<v Speaker 7>I'm not and I'm not talking about my </v>
<v Speaker 7>current situation at all.</v>

1161
00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:24.700
<v Speaker 7>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1162
00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.890
<v Speaker 7>I'm just saying in general,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1163
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 7>I've been thinking about it</v>

1164
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.920
<v Speaker 5>a lot lately is someone has to </v>
<v Speaker 5>appreciate you as much as you appreciate</v>

1165
00:50:30.921 --> 00:50:32.510
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If there's any sort of an imbalance like</v>

1166
00:50:32.511 --> 00:50:33.950
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if someone feels like they can shit</v>

1167
00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:37.220
<v Speaker 5>on you because you won't do anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they have the upper hand,</v>

1168
00:50:37.221 --> 00:50:39.020
<v Speaker 5>the relationship because you'll never </v>
<v Speaker 5>break up with that.</v>

1169
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:44.440
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that get in </v>
<v Speaker 5>those kinds of relationships and it's </v>

1170
00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:44.440
<v Speaker 5>fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a.</v>

1171
00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:48.271
<v Speaker 5>that's a shitty way to live your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a cowardly way to live your life </v>

1172
00:50:48.271 --> 00:50:52.540
<v Speaker 5>and that's why a lot of damaged girls </v>
<v Speaker 5>will date guys that are way under them </v>

1173
00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:54.740
<v Speaker 5>and they do it on purpose to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy's not going anywhere.</v>

1174
00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:58.250
<v Speaker 5>So a lot of times they'll meet like some</v>
<v Speaker 5>other dude and fuck them on the side.</v>

1175
00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:00.920
<v Speaker 5>That's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking for a damaged girl.</v>

1176
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:02.770
<v Speaker 5>I really am.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a need,</v>

1177
00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:06.980

<v Speaker 5>can't go out with women my age.</v>

<v Speaker 5>now I'm a lot older obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it never stops and.</v>

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean what I'm saying is I need </v>

<v Speaker 5>enamored by my tablet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't look at me like the Mongolian</v>

1184
00:51:26.211 --> 00:51:28.370
<v Speaker 5>looked that I am.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Whites.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Egg was like,</v>

1189
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:46.560
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of counteract that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Teresa did the same thing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Take weights and sausage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jerry's Deli.</v>

1191
00:51:50.181 --> 00:51:51.680
<v Speaker 5>So delicious though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard.</v>

1192
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:56.710
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's have a cheat meal every now and </v>

1193
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.710
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>

1194
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:57.110
<v Speaker 5>That's a good place to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not for me man.</v>

1195
00:51:57.111 --> 00:51:59.510
<v Speaker 5>So close to the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's open 24 hours a day,</v>

1196
00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:04.100
<v Speaker 5>three waffles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>best place on sunset as the standard.</v>

1197
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.080
<v Speaker 5>If they still have the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>food,</v>

1198
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:10.370
<v Speaker 5>I don't like it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what they add to tip to it,</v>

1199
00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:11.090
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

1200
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.630
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

1201
00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:16.850
<v Speaker 5>your food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I just looked at it the other day </v>

1202
00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:16.850
<v Speaker 5>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

1203
00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:19.961
<v Speaker 5>how long have they been doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just kind of put the tip into your </v>

1204
00:52:19.961 --> 00:52:23.380
<v Speaker 5>total.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you gave him a double tip and for a </v>

1205
00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:23.380
<v Speaker 5>good year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good,</v>

1206
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:24.590
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You did well.</v>

1207
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:26.300
<v Speaker 5>Good job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't like people that do that.</v>

1208
00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:31.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well they probably had to do it because </v>

1209
00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:31.480
<v Speaker 5>so many fucking drunks come out of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>bar.</v>

1210
00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.980
<v Speaker 5>Also people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Europeans and Canadians.</v>

1211
00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:38.330
<v Speaker 5>And that is sort of an international </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of makes sense that they know </v>

1212
00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:42.731
<v Speaker 5>everything about our culture and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden they don't know about </v>

1213
00:52:42.731 --> 00:52:42.731
<v Speaker 5>tipping.</v>

1214
00:52:42.731 --> 00:52:42.731
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't.</v>

1215
00:52:42.731 --> 00:52:43.700
<v Speaker 5>That's an alien to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a funny thing.</v>

1216
00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:47.150
<v Speaker 5>They know a lot of them knowing they use</v>
<v Speaker 5>it as an excuse.</v>

1217
00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's weird when you ever go to,</v>

1218
00:52:48.981 --> 00:52:49.790
<v Speaker 5>you've been to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1219
00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:52.730
<v Speaker 5>England and Irish many times you tip </v>
<v Speaker 5>over there and they look at you like,</v>

1220
00:52:52.731 --> 00:52:55.260
<v Speaker 5>what you had done a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had American,</v>

1221
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:56.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>remember ritual.</v>

1222
00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.680
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said to me,</v>

1223
00:52:57.681 --> 00:52:59.120
<v Speaker 5>I got tipped in Scotland.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1224
00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:01.670
<v Speaker 5>don't tip these people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to ruin it for all of us.</v>

1225
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:04.610
<v Speaker 5>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't tip in Japan.</v>

1226
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:06.410
<v Speaker 5>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1227
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:09.770
<v Speaker 5>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird how we do.</v>

1228
00:53:09.771 --> 00:53:14.771
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who else does it besides Americans to </v>

1229
00:53:14.771 --> 00:53:14.771
<v Speaker 5>the French tip?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1230
00:53:14.771 --> 00:53:14.840
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ten percent.</v>

1231
00:53:14.841 --> 00:53:17.610
<v Speaker 5>Maybe 10 percent of fresh is different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's.</v>

1232
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:22.630
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a thing they're on there </v>

1233
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:24.011
<v Speaker 5>for a tip and a lot of the credit card.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well even Canadians are different </v>

1234
00:53:24.011 --> 00:53:25.640
<v Speaker 5>because Canadians don't tip is about </v>
<v Speaker 5>Americans because you know,</v>

1235
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:29.460
<v Speaker 3>wages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody to much American told me that.</v>

1236
00:53:29.461 --> 00:53:34.461
<v Speaker 3>That was what she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was her nickname for black people </v>

1237
00:53:34.461 --> 00:53:35.080
<v Speaker 3>or Canadians because they didn't tip </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like an.</v>

1238
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:37.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting phenomena.</v>

1239
00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:42.300
<v Speaker 3>The black culture does not tip and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know the black culture,</v>

1240
00:53:42.301 --> 00:53:45.740
<v Speaker 3>but it is a portion of generally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1241
00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:46.590
<v Speaker 3>all black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1242
00:53:46.591 --> 00:53:49.830
<v Speaker 3>I've been out with Charles Barkley to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>a name dropper and he's ridiculous.</v>

1243
00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:52.000
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculously generous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a.</v>

1244
00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.220
<v Speaker 3>he's a very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God didn't gave me,</v>

1245
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:58.260
<v Speaker 3>this kid was late with the food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever hear this story?</v>

1246
00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:01.110
<v Speaker 3>I know he was late with the food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took them a long time.</v>

1247
00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:02.970
<v Speaker 3>Charles gave him a rolex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here he goes,</v>

1248
00:54:02.971 --> 00:54:04.410

1249
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:07.110
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1251
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:13.590
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately a stereotype though that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fits,</v>

1252
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1253
00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:19.570
<v Speaker 3>there's a video online of this girl who </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets back from a restaurant and it's </v>

1254
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:19.570
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1255
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:24.340
<v Speaker 3>I think it's calling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why I got a tip and have you ever seen </v>

1256
00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:27.381

<v Speaker 3>were so in the fucking comments was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>race war though.</v>

1258
00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:34.410
<v Speaker 3>The goddamn comments were a race war and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's basically,</v>

1259
00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:38.570
<v Speaker 3>she's just being an ignorant dumb ass </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1260
00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:41.170
<v Speaker 3>just flaunting and on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like wow,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a tip?</v>

1262
00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:46.590
<v Speaker 3>And someone came out and ran out and met</v>
<v Speaker 3>her in the parking lot and said,</v>

1263
00:54:46.591 --> 00:54:48.270
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be stiffing us.</v>

1264
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:52.140
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and have you ever seen him pull it up,</v>

1265
00:54:52.141 --> 00:54:55.920
<v Speaker 3>pull it up because you want to hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>about why I got a tip,</v>

1266
00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.280
<v Speaker 3>waitresses tents up on youtube or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>waitress was telling me how,</v>

1267
00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:04.340
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of times the black girls are </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean to them when they're in the </v>

1268
00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:07.440
<v Speaker 3>audience and my theory on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and tell me what you think is that black</v>

1269
00:55:07.441 --> 00:55:12.441
<v Speaker 3>women get stiffed a lot culturally and </v>
<v Speaker 3>invite a lot of black men because part </v>

1270
00:55:12.691 --> 00:55:16.710
<v Speaker 3>of a success in some eyes have some </v>
<v Speaker 3>black men,</v>

1271
00:55:16.711 --> 00:55:17.790
<v Speaker 3>is to have a white chick.</v>

1272
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:23.480
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're part of the culture until they </v>

1273
00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:26.091
<v Speaker 3>become a celebrity or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they got this toll Nordic blonde </v>

1274
00:55:26.091 --> 00:55:29.030
<v Speaker 3>with them on some of this and say why I </v>
<v Speaker 3>got tip?</v>

1275
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.750
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why the fuck I gotTa to know?</v>

1276
00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:37.290
<v Speaker 3>That's really why the fuck look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look up whatever she's referring to.</v>

1277
00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:42.320
<v Speaker 3>That's the one that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why the fuck I got a tip like I,</v>

1278
00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:44.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unfortunate.</v>

1279
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:50.270
<v Speaker 3>It's unfortunate that any culture would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have an inclination towards being </v>

1280
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.430
<v Speaker 3>stingy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1281
00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:52.320
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's unfortunate.</v>

1282
00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:57.980
<v Speaker 3>I think the best thing that could ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen to people in the black community </v>

1283
00:55:58.921 --> 00:56:03.921
<v Speaker 3>that get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get accused of this is for it to become </v>

1284
00:56:03.921 --> 00:56:04.350
<v Speaker 3>embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I'm all for it to become ridiculous</v>

1285
00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:05.460
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1286
00:56:05.461 --> 00:56:10.461
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everybody should realize that the </v>

1287
00:56:10.461 --> 00:56:10.461
<v Speaker 3>only way to prosperity is through </v>
<v Speaker 3>generosity.</v>

1288
00:56:10.461 --> 00:56:15.021
<v Speaker 3>If you're not generous person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd probably not going get anywhere </v>

1289
00:56:15.021 --> 00:56:17.550
<v Speaker 3>and that you really holding yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>back by not being kind and not,</v>

1290
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.290
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1291
00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 3>not being generous to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1292
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:25.630
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a shitty a aspect of any culture.</v>

1293
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:27.910
<v Speaker 3>But this one chick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you find it?</v>

1294
00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:33.070
<v Speaker 3>You see?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are all reasons.</v>

1295
00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:38.140
<v Speaker 3>Ari's why the fuck I gotta do a search </v>
<v Speaker 3>for why the fuck I got a tip jar.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I might be just be not on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even need it anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's on man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might not be on youtube anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Will you?</v>

1304
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:07.010
<v Speaker 3>People were so mad at her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She probably did pull it down.</v>

1305
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:11.170
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>

1306
00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.450

<v Speaker 3>Will they actually do.</v>

1311

<v Speaker 3>He got on the Chappelle show when he was</v>

1335
00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:29.140
<v Speaker 3>in his forties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1337
00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:32.980
<v Speaker 3>a little bit here and there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really struggling.</v>

1338
00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:38.200
<v Speaker 3>Got to the Chappelle show and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden started doing stand up and start </v>

1339
00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.170
<v Speaker 3>with headline and like within a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>of months,</v>

1340
00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:41.070
<v Speaker 3>that's 45.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1341
00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:45.030
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

1342
00:58:45.350 --> 00:58:46.530
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1343
00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:47.810
<v Speaker 3>a bike check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

1344
00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:51.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it doesn't exist anymore.</v>

1345
00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Maybe she pulled it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't matter.</v>

1346
00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:55.660
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1347
00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:56.790
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said.</v>

1348
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:57.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1349
00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:03.200
<v Speaker 3>Well the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unfortunate when people are </v>

1350
00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:06.330
<v Speaker 3>shitheads no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what was your theory about the black</v>

1351
00:59:06.331 --> 00:59:07.800
<v Speaker 3>girls?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get shafted in life.</v>

1352
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes they get bitter </v>

1353
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.010
<v Speaker 3>because they find that a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>black men become successful.</v>

1354
00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:17.270
<v Speaker 3>Think of something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not a general generalization.</v>

1355
00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:18.290
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1356
00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:20.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a generalization </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

1357
00:59:20.281 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes like they,</v>

1358
00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:25.610
<v Speaker 5>they find getting a white woman is an </v>
<v Speaker 5>arm piece and a sign of success.</v>

1359
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:28.610
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird thing in.</v>

1360
00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:32.480
<v Speaker 5>Or maybe they just liked the way it </v>
<v Speaker 5>looks or maybe they just want to fuck it</v>

1361
00:59:32.481 --> 00:59:33.920
<v Speaker 5>to the man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe just think of it.</v>

1362
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:36.240
<v Speaker 5>It's like some white dude to suppress </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1363
00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:41.030
<v Speaker 5>Daughter fantasy.</v>

1365
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:46.140

<v Speaker 7>Because the week before,</v>

1447
01:03:57.061 --> 01:03:59.090
<v Speaker 7>I think anybody who watches it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if it would know,</v>

1448
01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:01.270
<v Speaker 7>no one knows what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1449
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:04.590
<v Speaker 7>there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've talked about this bigfoot show and</v>

1450
01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:08.190
<v Speaker 7>then they talked about it on south park </v>
<v Speaker 7>and someone on a message board said,</v>

1451
01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:13.220
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>someone from south park probably heard </v>

1452
01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:13.220
<v Speaker 7>you guys talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

1453
01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:16.970
<v Speaker 7>but hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but anybody who watches that bigfoot </v>

1454
01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:19.610
<v Speaker 7>show is going to get the same job,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you're only missing half of it </v>

1455
01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:19.610
<v Speaker 7>though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well also in that episode,</v>

1456
01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:23.931
<v Speaker 7>supposedly I haven't seen this episode,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but supposedly there was a part where </v>

1457
01:04:23.931 --> 01:04:26.961
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't just hit your butthole is all day </v>

1458
01:04:26.961 --> 01:04:26.961
<v Speaker 7>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cartman says.</v>

1459
01:04:26.961 --> 01:04:29.190
<v Speaker 7>And then the week before I have this </v>
<v Speaker 7>whole thing at desk squad where I take a</v>

1460
01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:32.160
<v Speaker 7>take a piece of bread and I take the </v>
<v Speaker 7>ICAT bread where you,</v>

1461
01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:35.130
<v Speaker 7>I tell my fans to send me photos of them</v>
<v Speaker 7>taking a piece of bread,</v>

1462
01:04:35.131 --> 01:04:40.131
<v Speaker 7>taking a hole out of the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>brand and then putting their cat head </v>

1463
01:04:40.131 --> 01:04:40.680
<v Speaker 7>through it and I've been doing it for </v>
<v Speaker 7>about a month or so.</v>

1464
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:45.950
<v Speaker 7>And then after that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that last week's episode is all about </v>

1465
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.950
<v Speaker 7>like fucking cap reading and shit like </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

1466
01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:47.930
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't.</v>

1467
01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:53.130
<v Speaker 7>I didn't invent it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it was definitely a lot of people </v>

1468
01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:53.130
<v Speaker 7>like a really small niche of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>Internet,</v>

1469
01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:54.150
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was just there on the Internet.</v>

1470
01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:54.750
<v Speaker 7>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1471
01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.510
<v Speaker 7>I'm just saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's kind of funny that,</v>

1472
01:04:56.590 --> 01:05:01.590
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's something that I've been doing a </v>

1473
01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:01.590
<v Speaker 7>lot lately on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm not clear though.</v>

1474
01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:02.690
<v Speaker 7>Are you accusing them of watching?</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1475
01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:03.210
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1476
01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:03.570
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

1477
01:05:03.571 --> 01:05:06.990
<v Speaker 7>Here's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Last week when last week's episode,</v>

1478
01:05:06.991 --> 01:05:10.830
<v Speaker 7>it was really weird watching it because </v>
<v Speaker 7>for the last month that's what I've been</v>

1479
01:05:10.831 --> 01:05:14.130
<v Speaker 7>doing on twitter nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it was kind of cool to see that.</v>

1480
01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:19.460
<v Speaker 7>And then this week I heard that they </v>
<v Speaker 7>were talking about big foot and itching </v>

1481
01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:20.380
<v Speaker 7>assholes and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is getting cool.</v>

1482
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:23.880
<v Speaker 7>I hope everything that we talk about </v>
<v Speaker 7>becomes a cell phone.</v>

1483
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:29.990
<v Speaker 7>They're going to do is an episode about </v>
<v Speaker 7>a retard radio host who can't get his </v>

1484
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:31.530
<v Speaker 7>facts straight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cartman for something.</v>

1485
01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.060
<v Speaker 7>We didn't really do a garden,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but did you say cat breading?</v>

1486
01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:35.250
<v Speaker 7>Cap Reading?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's.</v>

1487
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:40.390
<v Speaker 7>It's so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are you talking about breeding breading </v>

1488
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.830
<v Speaker 7>now?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can take a crust of bread.</v>

1489
01:05:40.850 --> 01:05:45.850
<v Speaker 7>You make a hole in it and then put your </v>
<v Speaker 7>cat's head through it and you take a </v>

1490
01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:45.850
<v Speaker 7>photo.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's a grown man.</v>

1491
01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:48.030
<v Speaker 7>Who isn't that strange?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just fun to know.</v>

1492
01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:50.260

<v Speaker 4>But the club members wasn't like a club,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a club in the public.</v>

1520
01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:04.170
<v Speaker 4>They're having a vote for the president </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets up and starts talking.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's one guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1522
01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:09.140
<v Speaker 4>it escalated so quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1523

<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1527
01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:18.690
<v Speaker 4>we're real close to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

1528
01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:24.080
<v Speaker 4>you know what you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were saying about how you've seen </v>

1529
01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:24.080
<v Speaker 4>things like your hell unflappable.</v>

1530
01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.020
<v Speaker 4>You are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've seen things right next to you and</v>

1531
01:07:25.021 --> 01:07:26.940
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't even faze you like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>

1532
01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:27.900
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>

1533
01:07:27.901 --> 01:07:30.000
<v Speaker 4>So many fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what happened here,</v>

1534
01:07:30.001 --> 01:07:31.580
<v Speaker 4>but it was such an unlikely place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

1535
01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:33.180
<v Speaker 4>It was like everybody's cheering each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

1536
01:07:33.181 --> 01:07:36.780
<v Speaker 4>They're all either either Italian or </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to have some connection to Italy,</v>

1537
01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:38.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1538
01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:41.310
<v Speaker 4>And a real fight broke out and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't believe it.</v>

1539
01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:43.590
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want a piece of this.</v>

1540
01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:47.610
<v Speaker 4>I always thought that was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>more unfortunate aspects of our culture.</v>

1541
01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.970
<v Speaker 4>Italian Americans are very prone to </v>
<v Speaker 4>violence,</v>

1542
01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.710
<v Speaker 4>very rounded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fistfights,</v>

1543
01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:54.990
<v Speaker 4>Italians and Irish and Italians and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Irish.</v>

1544
01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:56.070
<v Speaker 4>Irish in you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1545
01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:57.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got the best of both worlds.</v>

1546
01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:01.260
<v Speaker 4>Three quarters as I am one quarter </v>
<v Speaker 4>Irish.</v>

1547
01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:02.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's they're always like,</v>

1548
01:08:02.911 --> 01:08:03.930
<v Speaker 4>well fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at it.</v>

1549
01:08:03.931 --> 01:08:06.270
<v Speaker 4>There's always a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially the east coast,</v>

1550
01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:11.720
<v Speaker 4>although scruffy immigrants raised kids </v>
<v Speaker 4>that carried a lot of those same </v>

1551
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000
<v Speaker 4>mentalities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The east coast is definitely more </v>

1552
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:17.000
<v Speaker 4>hostile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do people ever</v>

1553
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.290
<v Speaker 5>asked you about the mob?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you know it because you're.</v>

1554
01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:18.920
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1555
01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:20.890
<v Speaker 5>they were asking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1556
01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:25.900
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get it all the time really well </v>

1557
01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:25.900
<v Speaker 5>because of where I'm from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like,</v>

1558
01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:29.951
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I lived in a poor black </v>

1559
01:08:29.951 --> 01:08:29.951
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood in west Philadelphia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We moved from an Italian neighbor,</v>

1560
01:08:29.951 --> 01:08:31.610
<v Speaker 5>mean like we were really connected to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the mob.</v>

1561
01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:32.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Were undercover,</v>

1562
01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:37.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's why we're in this row home in a </v>

1563
01:08:37.690 --> 01:08:37.690
<v Speaker 5>black neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

1564
01:08:37.690 --> 01:08:39.680
<v Speaker 5>because we were the press whites,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1565
01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:44.710
<v Speaker 5>which was a very interesting perspective</v>
<v Speaker 5>of life because people don't ever think </v>

1566
01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:46.220
<v Speaker 5>about what about the white kids that </v>
<v Speaker 5>were let back in a black neighborhood.</v>

1567
01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:48.650
<v Speaker 5>I was lucky because I played ball and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were all my friends,</v>

1568
01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.040
<v Speaker 5>but you couldn't walk through there just</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a black kid couldn't walk through </v>

1569
01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:54.890
<v Speaker 5>the Italian neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that fucked up?</v>

1570
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:55.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fucked up.</v>

1571
01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:59.060
<v Speaker 5>When are we going to move past that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you know the people,</v>

1572
01:08:59.061 --> 01:08:59.850
<v Speaker 5>they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1573
01:08:59.910 --> 01:09:01.280
<v Speaker 5>you like him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1574
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:02.210
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>

1575
01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:07.420
<v Speaker 5>It's like any other community.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all about deciding who's going to </v>

1576
01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:07.420
<v Speaker 5>be nice to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1577
01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:12.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he decided these are the people we're </v>

1578
01:09:12.190 --> 01:09:12.190
<v Speaker 5>going to be nice to and you're not going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be nice.</v>

1579
01:09:12.190 --> 01:09:12.450
<v Speaker 5>Those assholes over there now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1580
01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.180
<v Speaker 5>we were talking about how we were in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Kentucky.</v>

1581
01:09:14.181 --> 01:09:17.330
<v Speaker 5>We were in Louisville and Louisville was</v>
<v Speaker 5>playing Louisville.</v>

1582
01:09:17.331 --> 01:09:20.120
<v Speaker 5>And how did that go when they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>playing crazy?</v>

1583
01:09:20.121 --> 01:09:25.121
<v Speaker 5>They started a riot and cars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cars on fire and shit.</v>

1584
01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.360
<v Speaker 5>But the crazy thing is it's Louisville </v>
<v Speaker 5>versus Kentucky.</v>

1585
01:09:29.361 --> 01:09:32.030
<v Speaker 5>It's like assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous.</v>

1586
01:09:32.031 --> 01:09:35.450
<v Speaker 5>You were in the same,</v>
<v Speaker 5>same stack as a fucking civil war.</v>

1587
01:09:35.451 --> 01:09:36.980
<v Speaker 5>This is the most preposterous thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:47.930
<v Speaker 5>Tuscaloosa for those people to get in </v>
<v Speaker 5>touch with each other.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same people.</v>

1592

1608
01:10:27.081 --> 01:10:28.400
<v Speaker 5>Has been the word of the month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1609
01:10:28.401 --> 01:10:28.780
<v Speaker 5>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1610
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:31.370
<v Speaker 5>I've been blasting it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every time it comes into my stupid head,</v>

1611
01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:37.700
<v Speaker 5>it gets into a groove where you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>start saying words that definitely.</v>

1612
01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:40.800
<v Speaker 5>Because I remember when we used to say </v>
<v Speaker 5>something else,</v>

1613
01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:46.440
<v Speaker 5>Joe was the first one I ever heard say </v>
<v Speaker 5>what ever bananas or whatever you was </v>

1614
01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.460
<v Speaker 5>the first one that made that inflection </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's spread all over the valley.</v>

1615
01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:54.500
<v Speaker 5>What ever you did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were the first one.</v>

1616
01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:59.501
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're the first one I ever heard.</v>

1617
01:11:00.411 --> 01:11:04.160
<v Speaker 5>Say it and then everybody started saying</v>
<v Speaker 5>it and then he didn't say it.</v>

1618
01:11:04.161 --> 01:11:07.490
<v Speaker 5>As much as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand what you're saying,</v>

1619
01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:08.260
<v Speaker 5>why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1620
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:13.270
<v Speaker 5>you'd be talking about like something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that would piss you off and you know </v>

1621
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.270
<v Speaker 5>what ever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1622
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:18.100
<v Speaker 5>it's like the instead of saying whatever</v>
<v Speaker 5>you made that beat what ever and then I </v>

1623
01:11:18.421 --> 01:11:22.110
<v Speaker 5>didn't know I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really have no idea.</v>

1624
01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:23.580
<v Speaker 5>I get Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you so much.</v>

1625
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:25.820
<v Speaker 5>You know me very well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My friends,</v>

1626
01:11:25.821 --> 01:11:27.630
<v Speaker 5>we've known each other a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell me more.</v>

1627
01:11:27.631 --> 01:11:32.631
<v Speaker 5>Tell me more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'd known each other since the </v>

1628
01:11:32.631 --> 01:11:34.800
<v Speaker 5>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We met back in the day when I was living</v>

1629
01:11:34.801 --> 01:11:36.320
<v Speaker 5>in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm really bad at it.</v>

1630
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:38.050
<v Speaker 5>Caroline's or at um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1631
01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:39.600
<v Speaker 5>Amsterdam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Billiards wants to.</v>

1632
01:11:39.601 --> 01:11:40.920
<v Speaker 5>We just ran into each other.</v>

1633
01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:43.440
<v Speaker 5>Tom and railroad can shoot a hell of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>game of pool.</v>

1634
01:11:43.441 --> 01:11:45.240
<v Speaker 5>Tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to start saying that.</v>

1635
01:11:45.241 --> 01:11:50.241
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what ever the pause that makes it</v>

1636
01:11:50.791 --> 01:11:54.260
<v Speaker 5>so unique and that caused the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

1637
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:58.560
<v Speaker 5>That's where all the brilliance lies are</v>
<v Speaker 5>used to crack me up when people go to me</v>

1638
01:11:58.561 --> 01:12:00.220
<v Speaker 5>a like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

1639
01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.880
<v Speaker 5>Like you're going to take credit for </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1640
01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:05.730
<v Speaker 5>And then you were the first one I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like people would say to me,</v>

1641
01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:08.460
<v Speaker 5>does it bother you that the sopranos do </v>
<v Speaker 5>Bada Boom,</v>

<v Speaker 5>well you did it before them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

1645
01:12:11.831 --> 01:12:16.831
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I was around before the show </v>

1646
01:12:16.831 --> 01:12:16.831
<v Speaker 5>started.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't make up acting Italian.</v>

1647
01:12:16.831 --> 01:12:18.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't make them forget about it.</v>

1648
01:12:18.301 --> 01:12:21.210
<v Speaker 5>You know why I was the first one that </v>
<v Speaker 5>should forget about it.</v>

1649
01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:23.600
<v Speaker 5>I had the nastiest thing happened to me </v>
<v Speaker 5>last night,</v>

1650
01:12:23.601 --> 01:12:27.450
<v Speaker 5>dropped my iphone in my beer and hold it</v>
<v Speaker 5>out real fast.</v>

1651
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:32.510
<v Speaker 5>And then I just did the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought of it like I'll suck all the </v>

1652
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:35.480
<v Speaker 5>beer out of the like sucking the holes </v>
<v Speaker 5>like as hard as I thought it was.</v>

1653

<v Speaker 5>Shit was coming in my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then like something like a slime </v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Xanax,</v>

1722
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:45.020
<v Speaker 5>they all like the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't really know.</v>

1723
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:46.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't like smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

1724
01:15:46.511 --> 01:15:47.170
<v Speaker 5>You can eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1725
01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.840
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can eat,</v>

1726
01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:54.380
<v Speaker 5>need to attack what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You haven't smoked weed,</v>

1727
01:15:54.541 --> 01:15:55.490
<v Speaker 5>those sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1728
01:15:55.570 --> 01:16:00.570
<v Speaker 5>for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you take so much xanax you might </v>

1729
01:16:00.570 --> 01:16:04.981
<v Speaker 5>just take a hit once just to see if it </v>
<v Speaker 5>does anything for you and get that new </v>

1730
01:16:04.981 --> 01:16:08.221
<v Speaker 5>stuff because this is a cheaper </v>
<v Speaker 5>alternative that will probably drink a </v>

1731
01:16:08.221 --> 01:16:10.180
<v Speaker 5>lot though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing good.</v>

1732
01:16:10.181 --> 01:16:14.830
<v Speaker 5>I drank a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said it was like my vitamin you drink</v>

1733
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:17.140
<v Speaker 5>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you like Ed Mcmahon style?</v>

1734
01:16:17.170 --> 01:16:22.170
<v Speaker 5>I do and I'm hung over every day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is really a testament to my comedy</v>

1735
01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:24.130
<v Speaker 5>because it's great.</v>

1736
01:16:24.130 --> 01:16:25.540
<v Speaker 5>That's a great thing about being a </v>
<v Speaker 5>comedian.</v>

1737
01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:29.530
<v Speaker 5>You can actually function as an um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm way more joe then when we hung out a</v>

1738
01:16:29.531 --> 01:16:34.531
<v Speaker 5>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm way more alcoholic then I think </v>

1739
01:16:34.531 --> 01:16:36.070
<v Speaker 5>because I graduated to a hard hard </v>
<v Speaker 5>liquor.</v>

1740
01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:39.040
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of a girl.</v>

1741
01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:40.540
<v Speaker 5>I don't know where to go from here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1742
01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:41.340
<v Speaker 5>because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1743
01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:44.980
<v Speaker 5>my girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my sister died a couple of other things.</v>

1744
01:16:44.981 --> 01:16:49.981
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I find that to be a really fun </v>

1745
01:16:49.981 --> 01:16:50.470
<v Speaker 5>habit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1746
01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.650
<v Speaker 5>I don't like the hangover,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I time it,</v>

1747
01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.270
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1748
01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:55.470
<v Speaker 5>if I go to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pick a hamper,</v>

1749
01:16:55.480 --> 01:17:00.480
<v Speaker 5>xanax and six hours I'll be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right now I'm a little dizzy from the </v>

1750
01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.410
<v Speaker 5>combination of the tranquilizer and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>alcohol,</v>

1751
01:17:02.411 --> 01:17:07.411
<v Speaker 5>but I do feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you supposed to take those two </v>

1752
01:17:07.411 --> 01:17:07.411
<v Speaker 5>together?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1753
01:17:07.411 --> 01:17:07.900
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How bad is it for you?</v>

1754
01:17:07.930 --> 01:17:09.470
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can stop your heart.</v>

1755
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:10.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can tell.</v>

1756
01:17:10.230 --> 01:17:11.060
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1757
01:17:11.061 --> 01:17:12.480
<v Speaker 5>it's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1758
01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.570
<v Speaker 5>that's why I keep the time in between </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1759
01:17:14.970 --> 01:17:17.000
<v Speaker 5>It like six to eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I made that up.</v>

1760
01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:21.520
<v Speaker 5>I totally made it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm thinking.</v>

1761
01:17:21.521 --> 01:17:25.280
<v Speaker 5>That's what in the alcohol metabolize </v>
<v Speaker 5>and about that much.</v>

1762
01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:28.700
<v Speaker 5>If I'm drunk I don't take anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I feel drunk.</v>

1763
01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:29.960
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wait until I feel.</v>

1764
01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.600
<v Speaker 5>But if you take the Xanax and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>under the effects of it,</v>

1765
01:17:32.601 --> 01:17:34.940
<v Speaker 5>sometimes they'll have a couple drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1766
01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:36.740
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not usually.</v>

1767
01:17:36.741 --> 01:17:39.080
<v Speaker 5>I mean not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's one of the plane,</v>

1768
01:17:39.090 --> 01:17:40.720
<v Speaker 5>maybe A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1769
01:17:40.730 --> 01:17:42.950
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the other hoping there's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>doctor on board.</v>

1770
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:45.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1771
01:17:45.701 --> 01:17:47.210
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't do that.</v>

1772
01:17:47.211 --> 01:17:48.860
<v Speaker 5>You should switch to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'd get off my back.</v>

<v Speaker 5>this?</v>

01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:24.570
<v Speaker 5>What'd you say about working out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if you fuck pillars?</v>

1838
01:20:24.571 --> 01:20:29.571
<v Speaker 5>That's like working out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's kind of any movement you do </v>

1839
01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:33.480
<v Speaker 5>more two minutes to your life on this </v>
<v Speaker 5>planet.</v>

1840
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:34.650
<v Speaker 5>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially for him?</v>

1841
01:20:34.651 --> 01:20:35.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

1842
01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:38.120
<v Speaker 5>It's one step on a grave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One by appeal.</v>

1843
01:20:38.970 --> 01:20:40.470
<v Speaker 5>Dead Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dead Man walking.</v>

1844
01:20:40.471 --> 01:20:45.471
<v Speaker 5>I get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not taken care of this vehicle now </v>

1845
01:20:45.471 --> 01:20:48.770
<v Speaker 5>he's just riding it and stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 5>cheetos and do it a little shit.</v>

1846
01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:53.840
<v Speaker 5>Beer and the cigarettes are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The real issue was fucking unbelievably </v>

1847
01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:54.260
<v Speaker 5>bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1848
01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:56.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are really bad.</v>

1849
01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:59.400
<v Speaker 5>You never get that right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should I go to sixth grade?</v>

1850
01:21:00.090 --> 01:21:03.040
<v Speaker 5>What did you do it for?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1851
01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:08.090
<v Speaker 5>I used to get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My grandfather would get samples and I </v>

1852
01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:09.780
<v Speaker 5>would smoke cigarette one after another </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the fucking that we so dizzy.</v>

1853
01:21:09.781 --> 01:21:10.600
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1854
01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:11.910
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1855
01:21:11.911 --> 01:21:14.400
<v Speaker 5>you get high by smoking just like only </v>
<v Speaker 5>after another.</v>

1856
01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:15.720
<v Speaker 5>He.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>

1857
01:21:15.930 --> 01:21:19.830
<v Speaker 5>but it's not a fun high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're dizzy or lightheaded,</v>

1858
01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:20.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>roll up.</v>

1859
01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.680
<v Speaker 5>I never threw up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's nauseating.</v>

1860
01:21:24.090 --> 01:21:29.090
<v Speaker 5>I threw up from chewing tobacco once,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so gross the baseball player spit that </v>

1861
01:21:30.571 --> 01:21:32.380
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's on a rug.</v>

1862
01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the astronaut.</v>

1863
01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:38.480
<v Speaker 5>It's a rug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like grass where it gets </v>

1864
01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:38.480
<v Speaker 5>absorbed into the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1865
01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.930
<v Speaker 5>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are they allowed to spit it on the </v>

1866
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:41.930
<v Speaker 5>astroturf?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do.</v>

1867
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:42.780
<v Speaker 5>You see them?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1868
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:47.950
<v Speaker 5>Fucking nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember that scene from the naked gun </v>

1869
01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:47.990
<v Speaker 5>or something where the world starts </v>
<v Speaker 5>spitting and.</v>

1870
01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just hilarious.</v>

1871
01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:54.210
<v Speaker 5>Fucking figured out how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it funny that that's legal?</v>

1872
01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:58.140
<v Speaker 5>Chewing tobacco,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but cocoa leaves our legal thing,</v>

1873
01:21:58.770 --> 01:22:01.500
<v Speaker 5>which is probably better for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Matter of fact,</v>

1874
01:22:01.501 --> 01:22:04.290
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely better for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think people were eating chewing</v>

1875
01:22:04.291 --> 01:22:09.291
<v Speaker 5>cocoa leaves and getting cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever see these new cancer </v>

1876
01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:09.291
<v Speaker 5>commercials in?</v>

1877
01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:09.680
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scared the fuck out of here.</v>

1878
01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:11.260
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen that one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian?</v>

1879
01:22:11.650 --> 01:22:13.290
<v Speaker 5>They're pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all are.</v>

1880
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:18.350
<v Speaker 5>They all suck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially like when they have holes in </v>

1881
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.350
<v Speaker 5>their throats and that doesn't make you </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to quit smoking.</v>

1882
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:20.730
<v Speaker 5>Guys looking at a windows maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long have you been smoking?</v>

1883
01:22:21.570 --> 01:22:25.710
<v Speaker 5>Since I was 15.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the idea of starting now,</v>

1884
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:30.420
<v Speaker 5>after all we've seen that's really crazy</v>
<v Speaker 5>drinking every day like,</v>

1885
01:22:30.421 --> 01:22:31.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>alcohol is bad for you,</v>

1886
01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:34.620
<v Speaker 5>but the idea of like figuring out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I'll start this.</v>

1887
01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:36.780
<v Speaker 5>I think I'll start this habit that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't have yet.</v>

1888
01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:38.770
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

1889
01:22:38.771 --> 01:22:43.771
<v Speaker 5>what made you start?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you're saying you were way more </v>

1890
01:22:43.771 --> 01:22:45.330
<v Speaker 5>of an alcoholic now than you were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a progressive disease,</v>

1891
01:22:45.331 --> 01:22:46.920
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the fun thing about it.</v>

1892
01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:51.980
<v Speaker 5>Did you get better at it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever decide to do anything about </v>

1893
01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:51.980
<v Speaker 5>it?</v>

1894
01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:54.590
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever decide to slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take whatever.</v>

1895
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:57.510
<v Speaker 5>I'm hung over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I quit until that night.</v>

1896
01:22:57.670 --> 01:23:01.560
<v Speaker 5>Then we had a funny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was on a tour bus,</v>

1897
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:03.900
<v Speaker 5>remember when I was roping for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1898
01:23:04.150 --> 01:23:09.150
<v Speaker 5>We're funny thing that I created this </v>
<v Speaker 5>waitress at the laugh factory about the </v>

1899
01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:11.110
<v Speaker 5>other night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Me and my friend Ali,</v>

1900
01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.760
<v Speaker 5>we never slept on the bus and were </v>
<v Speaker 5>drinking all night and we go,</v>

1901
01:23:14.770 --> 01:23:17.160
<v Speaker 5>we got to quit drinking a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1902
01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:18.220
<v Speaker 5>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is it.</v>

1903
01:23:18.221 --> 01:23:19.620
<v Speaker 5>It's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking killing,</v>

1904
01:23:19.630 --> 01:23:24.630
<v Speaker 5>killing our bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so in about an hour we're sobering </v>

1905
01:23:24.630 --> 01:23:25.330
<v Speaker 5>up and we go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1906
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:29.070
<v Speaker 5>men drink it for a while and it's night </v>
<v Speaker 5>and scraping sober.</v>

1907
01:23:29.071 --> 01:23:34.071
<v Speaker 5>What do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We celebrate our sobriety with the </v>

1908
01:23:34.071 --> 01:23:34.071
<v Speaker 5>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that was,</v>

1909
01:23:34.071 --> 01:23:36.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that this girl the other night a,</v>

1910
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:38.800
<v Speaker 5>the factor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We did something like,</v>

1911
01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:39.710
<v Speaker 5>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not drinking that.</v>

1912
01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.550
<v Speaker 5>I said me neither.</v>

1913
01:23:40.930 --> 01:23:45.930
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well we'll have one as a reward for not </v>

1914
01:23:45.930 --> 01:23:46.770
<v Speaker 5>drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't drink.</v>

1915
01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:49.120
<v Speaker 5>I drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't drink a lot.</v>

1916
01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.800
<v Speaker 5>I can take a shot man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can do shots.</v>

1917
01:23:54.450 --> 01:23:59.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to try to keep it as balanced as </v>

1918
01:23:59.450 --> 01:24:02.461
<v Speaker 5>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could get addicted to just getting </v>

1919
01:24:02.461 --> 01:24:02.461
<v Speaker 5>fucked up all the time and going </v>
<v Speaker 5>onstage,</v>

1920
01:24:03.050 --> 01:24:04.600
<v Speaker 5>onstage stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucked up anything.</v>

1921
01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:07.210
<v Speaker 5>I really lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Quickness.</v>

1922
01:24:07.211 --> 01:24:09.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many times he got upset onstage.</v>

1923
01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:12.430
<v Speaker 5>Fucked up accidentally though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe 10,</v>

1924
01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:15.190
<v Speaker 5>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe 20.</v>

1925
01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:18.610
<v Speaker 5>50.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hit,</v>

1926
01:24:18.630 --> 01:24:20.620
<v Speaker 5>you know when you know what's bad is </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting drunk.</v>

1927
01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:23.770
<v Speaker 5>If you're going to do an hour because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to pee,</v>

1928
01:24:23.771 --> 01:24:25.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to really watch that.</v>

1929
01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:28.120
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I have A.</v>

1930
01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:31.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm not better as a drunk because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>not nervous doing standup.</v>

1931
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:36.870
<v Speaker 5>So alcohol does me no good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just dulls me and it and it slows the</v>

1932
01:24:37.541 --> 01:24:39.370
<v Speaker 5>quickness down the reaction a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>bit,</v>

1933
01:24:39.371 --> 01:24:41.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to timing on.</v>

1934
01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:46.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm much better on coffee than I am one </v>

1935
01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:46.940
<v Speaker 5>booze.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1936
01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:47.980
<v Speaker 5>Because I don't have any fear of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stage,</v>

1937
01:24:47.981 --> 01:24:49.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fear of.</v>

1938
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:51.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to get you some of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>alphabet and stuff for real.</v>

1939
01:24:51.191 --> 01:24:53.180
<v Speaker 5>Take it before you go on stage telling </v>
<v Speaker 5>an hour before.</v>

1940
01:24:53.250 --> 01:24:55.330
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The stuff we're selling it on,</v>

1941
01:24:55.331 --> 01:24:56.400
<v Speaker 5>it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1942
01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:57.310
<v Speaker 5>I got bottles of it,</v>

1943
01:24:57.830 --> 01:25:02.830
<v Speaker 7>something the other day I was really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it started doing where I'll order it </v>

1944
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:04.940
<v Speaker 7>like a vodka and diet coke and then I'll</v>
<v Speaker 7>tell the guy like everyday,</v>

1945
01:25:05.210 --> 01:25:10.210
<v Speaker 7>every three of them make them just diet </v>
<v Speaker 7>cokes and so I don't even know when I'm </v>

1946
01:25:10.210 --> 01:25:12.980
<v Speaker 7>doing it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I felt drunk at the end of the night</v>

1947
01:25:12.981 --> 01:25:14.120
<v Speaker 7>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how many have I had it?</v>

1948
01:25:14.121 --> 01:25:15.620
<v Speaker 7>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've had any auto and you've been here</v>

1949
01:25:15.621 --> 01:25:17.060
<v Speaker 7>for six hours,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you're from.</v>

1950
01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:21.600
<v Speaker 5>So you couldn't have been yourself like </v>
<v Speaker 5>it was psychosomatic,</v>

1957
01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:39.150
<v Speaker 5>contradiction in terms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a really bright retort.</v>

<v Speaker 5>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>girl,</v>

<v Speaker 5>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only as.</v>

1972
01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:15.340
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't really have to do that from </v>

1974
01:26:20.610 --> 01:26:21.190
<v Speaker 5>Regina.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I know it looks like you would get a</v>

1975
01:26:21.191 --> 01:26:25.690
<v Speaker 5>kick out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1976
01:26:25.691 --> 01:26:30.691
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's uncomfortable getting to know that </v>

1977
01:26:30.691 --> 01:26:33.010
<v Speaker 5>world that with the normal to them too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is very strange.</v>

1978
01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:33.920
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1979
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:36.280
<v Speaker 5>it's so stereotypical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the weird.</v>

1980
01:26:36.281 --> 01:26:38.650
<v Speaker 5>The weird thing about that world is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1981
01:26:38.651 --> 01:26:41.950
<v Speaker 5>a lot of them are very nice and you get </v>
<v Speaker 5>to meet them and you're like,</v>

1982
01:26:41.951 --> 01:26:46.951
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is just some nice girl who just </v>

1983
01:26:46.951 --> 01:26:48.970
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another she found herself in </v>
<v Speaker 5>some situation where she has this almost</v>

1984
01:26:48.971 --> 01:26:53.971
<v Speaker 5>insatiable desire for sexual attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And lot of that is because they were </v>

1985
01:26:53.971 --> 01:26:53.971
<v Speaker 5>molested.</v>

1986
01:26:53.971 --> 01:26:56.920
<v Speaker 5>And then when you find that out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a buzz kill.</v>

1987
01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:00.590
<v Speaker 5>Then you start feeling bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That humanized.</v>

1988
01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:02.710
<v Speaker 5>Humanize them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna lose all your fantasy.</v>

1989
01:27:02.770 --> 01:27:04.510
<v Speaker 5>You lose your boner for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you,</v>

1990
01:27:04.511 --> 01:27:06.160
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you talked to some of them,</v>

1991
01:27:06.230 --> 01:27:07.810
<v Speaker 5>some of them say that nothing's ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened to him.</v>

1992
01:27:07.811 --> 01:27:08.860
<v Speaker 5>And I believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's,</v>

1993
01:27:08.861 --> 01:27:11.740
<v Speaker 5>it's possible that they could need </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention for other reasons.</v>

1994
01:27:11.770 --> 01:27:12.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a more.</v>

1995
01:27:12.731 --> 01:27:14.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe they just rationalize it.</v>

1996
01:27:14.411 --> 01:27:15.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1997
01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.860
<v Speaker 5>or maybe that's just their reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they don't have a problem with it.</v>

1998
01:27:17.861 --> 01:27:19.150
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>

1999
01:27:19.151 --> 01:27:21.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying when you delve into that </v>
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

2000
01:27:21.710 --> 01:27:24.130
<v Speaker 5>it's gotta be something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2001
01:27:24.190 --> 01:27:25.970
<v Speaker 5>a lot of times there is strippers.</v>

01:30:22.690 --> 01:30:23.540
<v Speaker 5>anxiety actually increases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2067
01:30:23.541 --> 01:30:26.120
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't get off it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's a daily thing.</v>

2068
01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:28.850
<v Speaker 5>Every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had just heard from someone,</v>

2069
01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:30.920
<v Speaker 5>we were just talking about this and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>goes,</v>

2070
01:30:30.921 --> 01:30:34.370
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't fucking imagine taking xanax </v>
<v Speaker 5>every day.</v>

2071
01:30:34.371 --> 01:30:36.770
<v Speaker 5>He just said this to me because it makes</v>
<v Speaker 5>you sleepy.</v>

2072
01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:38.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what it does.</v>

2073
01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:40.190
<v Speaker 5>Is it do it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you want to try one?</v>

2074
01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:42.190
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2075
01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.700
<v Speaker 5>why don't we.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When we get in the car,</v>

2076
01:30:43.701 --> 01:30:47.420
<v Speaker 5>I'll give you one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's for me.</v>

2077
01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:49.510
<v Speaker 5>I've actually tried it now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad that you do part.</v>

2078
01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:54.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you like I was telling you </v>

2079
01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:56.121
<v Speaker 5>before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you seem so much more at peace with </v>

2080
01:30:56.121 --> 01:30:56.121
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a bunch of come down a lot.</v>

2081
01:30:56.121 --> 01:30:58.400
<v Speaker 5>I think it definitely helped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a bunch of life experiences,</v>

2082
01:30:58.430 --> 01:31:03.430
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of psychedelic experiences to a </v>

2083
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.830
<v Speaker 5>bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd be so afraid to do that shit.</v>

2084
01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:04.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

2085
01:31:05.210 --> 01:31:10.210
<v Speaker 5>But because I'm a pushy registered,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've learned it.</v>

2086
01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:17.340
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the psychedelics changed me a lot for </v>

2087
01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:17.340
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2088
01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:19.550
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to gain perspective.</v>

2089
01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:22.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure I've done them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure several times.</v>

2090
01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:26.780
<v Speaker 5>It's not about bath salts as you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>even say that.</v>

2091
01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:31.781
<v Speaker 5>Brian fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody might hear that and it's some </v>

2092
01:31:32.211 --> 01:31:37.211
<v Speaker 5>new fucked up drug they're selling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a cousin to crystal meth and </v>

2093
01:31:37.211 --> 01:31:40.781
<v Speaker 5>they can sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what's even worse is that fake we'd </v>

2094
01:31:40.781 --> 01:31:43.630
<v Speaker 5>that we'd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been reading all the shit lately </v>

2095
01:31:43.630 --> 01:31:43.630
<v Speaker 5>about that fake weed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that synthetic,</v>

2096
01:31:43.630 --> 01:31:45.020
<v Speaker 5>synthetic weed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how bad it is for you.</v>

2097
01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:50.870
<v Speaker 5>That was good about the part that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>get is that you're getting it from an </v>

2098
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:54.160
<v Speaker 5>illegal place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which means hopefully it's not tainted </v>

2099
01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:58.091
<v Speaker 5>in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why anybody would go to a </v>

2100
01:31:58.091 --> 01:32:01.510
<v Speaker 5>really shady neighborhood and buy shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>on for a drug dealer who may never see </v>

2101
01:32:01.511 --> 01:32:03.580
<v Speaker 5>them again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would you trust that guy?</v>

2102
01:32:03.610 --> 01:32:08.610
<v Speaker 5>Let me cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gotta do what you gotta do it the </v>

2103
01:32:08.610 --> 01:32:12.050
<v Speaker 5>cheapest price you gotta do what you got</v>
<v Speaker 5>to pay when you're in a dance.</v>

2104
01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:17.340
<v Speaker 5>One of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of those sayings that he can't </v>

2105
01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:17.340
<v Speaker 5>argue with you gotta do what you gotTa </v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

2106
01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:17.820
<v Speaker 5>It is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like whatever it is,</v>

2107
01:32:17.821 --> 01:32:20.140
<v Speaker 5>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what else could it be and what it is.</v>

2108
01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:21.910
<v Speaker 5>What else could it be?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can be a.</v>

2109
01:32:21.911 --> 01:32:26.911
<v Speaker 5>You could be looking at it in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>distorted way because they're saying </v>

2110
01:32:26.911 --> 01:32:26.920
<v Speaker 5>what it is.</v>

2111
01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:31.920
<v Speaker 5>What it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is you might be looking at it and some </v>

2112
01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:31.920
<v Speaker 5>sort of a fucked up way to justify your </v>
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>

2113
01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:33.440
<v Speaker 5>I never expected an answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 5>question.</v>

2114
01:32:33.441 --> 01:32:35.120
<v Speaker 5>That was a rhetorical question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I appreciate the.</v>

2115
01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:38.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't let them off float out there.</v>

2116
01:32:38.530 --> 01:32:43.530
<v Speaker 5>If you walk around a rhetorical one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that needs to be addressed in a very </v>

2117
01:32:43.530 --> 01:32:48.061
<v Speaker 5>literal sense already.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was laughing about something last </v>

2118
01:32:48.250 --> 01:32:51.340
<v Speaker 5>night about you was telling eleanor,</v>

<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2124

<v Speaker 5>it was called Supreme Court,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a comedy.</v>

2172
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:02.980
<v Speaker 4>you to do it because I'm the judge and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's real small claims cases and they </v>

2173
01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:10.600
<v Speaker 4>people sign a contract that says they </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't sue again in a real small claims </v>

2174
01:35:10.881 --> 01:35:13.820
<v Speaker 4>court that I make the final decision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I just told them,</v>

2175
01:35:13.821 --> 01:35:14.460
<v Speaker 4>I says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2176
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:17.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't really know much about the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2177
01:35:17.241 --> 01:35:19.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's a hot chick,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Never wanting to just jump out the </v>

2262
01:38:47.541 --> 01:38:47.541
<v Speaker 3>window.</v>

2263
01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2264
01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:51.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

2265
01:38:51.331 --> 01:38:53.610
<v Speaker 3>when you get ideas in your head of </v>
<v Speaker 3>moderation,</v>

2266
01:38:54.150 --> 01:38:55.500
<v Speaker 3>what is the,</v>

2268
01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:01.770
<v Speaker 3>Let me just kick back a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stick around a little longer.</v>

2269
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:03.420
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you thinking of when you,</v>

2270
01:39:03.450 --> 01:39:06.000
<v Speaker 3>when you go moderation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2271
01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:10.530
<v Speaker 3>I think I only think that way when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>hung over and then when I'm,</v>

2272
01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.140
<v Speaker 3>when I'm normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel invincible.</v>

2273
01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:16.800
<v Speaker 3>Normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2274
01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:21.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I just feel like I could drink </v>

2275
01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:24.051
<v Speaker 3>and I know a little bit of booze and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit of Xanax just makes you feel </v>

2276
01:39:24.051 --> 01:39:24.660
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just feel on top of it.</v>

2277
01:39:24.670 --> 01:39:25.360
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2278
01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:27.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does a lot of booze.</v>

2279
01:39:27.331 --> 01:39:28.050
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>

2280
01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:34.280
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to an emergency room </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor and she told me that the Xanax </v>

2281
01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:36.750
<v Speaker 3>that I take at the level I take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is probably a placebo at this point.</v>

2282
01:39:37.050 --> 01:39:37.710
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2283
01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:39.210
<v Speaker 3>she said because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never,</v>

2284
01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:42.750
<v Speaker 3>I never upped the dosage because I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stupid,</v>

2285
01:39:42.751 --> 01:39:47.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to get to a point I </v>

2286
01:39:47.751 --> 01:39:47.751
<v Speaker 3>never got high on Xanax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2287
01:39:47.751 --> 01:39:51.381
<v Speaker 3>is that what you're supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to continue to up the </v>

2288
01:39:51.381 --> 01:39:51.381
<v Speaker 3>dosage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2289
01:39:51.381 --> 01:39:54.341
<v Speaker 3>but I think if I were an addict in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of like being really addicted to </v>

2290
01:39:54.341 --> 01:39:56.880
<v Speaker 3>the drug and the feeling of it would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal to try and get higher.</v>

2291
01:39:57.390 --> 01:40:02.390
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just a psychological thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think I needed to go back to </v>

2292
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:05.871
<v Speaker 3>sleep and I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well when you hear about a guy's like </v>

2293

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2372

<v Speaker 5>I did call me because I think it's fun </v>

2374
01:43:44.991 --> 01:43:44.991
<v Speaker 5>once in a while,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't obsess about it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's just kind of.</v>

2377
01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:51.620
<v Speaker 5>Because I do so much podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I consider this like a different kind of</v>

2378
01:43:51.621 --> 01:43:55.010
<v Speaker 5>comedy where instead of doing like 15 </v>
<v Speaker 5>people at a comedy club,</v>

2381
01:43:58.430 --> 01:44:00.960
<v Speaker 5>on podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a kind of form of comedy.</v>

2382
01:44:00.961 --> 01:44:02.570
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard people say that about posting</v>

2383
01:44:02.571 --> 01:44:04.670
<v Speaker 5>on message boards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Internet Comedians,</v>

2384
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:07.670
<v Speaker 5>just like text base Internet comedians.</v>

<v Speaker 5>the corner underneath the hat.</v>

2388

01:44:58.751 --> 01:45:00.560
<v Speaker 5>comedy is simply a way of saying comedy </v>
<v Speaker 5>for us.</v>

2408
01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:05.560
<v Speaker 5>So to the people who couldn't get on </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the regular place and the people </v>

2409
01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:05.560
<v Speaker 5>they could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they worshiped like Patton Oswald,</v>

2410
01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:08.490
<v Speaker 5>who's great comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2411
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:10.190
<v Speaker 5>it's just comedy man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2412
01:45:10.191 --> 01:45:15.191
<v Speaker 5>the idea is that what Bursa that was so </v>
<v Speaker 5>hilarious was that they took the fear </v>

2413
01:45:15.191 --> 01:45:19.931
<v Speaker 5>out of comedy and they made it so </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone's ultra supportive and he go </v>

2414
01:45:19.931 --> 01:45:20.380
<v Speaker 5>there and you can be like really </v>
<v Speaker 5>awkward.</v>

2415
01:45:20.670 --> 01:45:25.670
<v Speaker 5>And then he goes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile we had to go through fucking </v>

2416
01:45:25.670 --> 01:45:25.670
<v Speaker 5>bars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2417
01:45:25.970 --> 01:45:30.970
<v Speaker 5>the places that we did stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were starting out and booed at and </v>

2418
01:45:30.970 --> 01:45:31.020
<v Speaker 5>screened by drunks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2419
01:45:31.021 --> 01:45:32.870
<v Speaker 5>But do you believe if you're either </v>
<v Speaker 5>funny or you're not?</v>

2420
01:45:33.170 --> 01:45:34.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I believe that.</v>

2421
01:45:34.461 --> 01:45:35.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to believe that,</v>

2422
01:45:35.691 --> 01:45:40.040
<v Speaker 5>but then I see people that were fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible and they stuck with it and they</v>

2423
01:45:40.041 --> 01:45:41.920
<v Speaker 5>figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they learn.</v>

2424
01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:45.080
<v Speaker 5>You can get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can get to a certain point on,</v>

2425
01:45:45.190 --> 01:45:50.190
<v Speaker 5>on hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a certain point you can't </v>

2426
01:45:50.190 --> 01:45:50.510
<v Speaker 5>get to without talent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>absolutely sucked and they figured out </v>

<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of this episode,</v>

2522
01:50:03.011 --> 01:50:06.140
<v Speaker 4>your twitter numbers are probably going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to drop really well.</v>

2523
01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:09.250
<v Speaker 4>People are going to unfollow you and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't have gone into the xanax thing</v>

2524
01:50:09.670 --> 01:50:11.940
<v Speaker 4>if we're going to feel bad for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2525
01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:14.680
<v Speaker 4>you're being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the way you're explaining it and</v>

2526
01:50:14.681 --> 01:50:19.681
<v Speaker 4>describing it as you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're pretty logical about it.</v>

2527
01:50:21.970 --> 01:50:24.640
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in love with it.</v>

2528
01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:26.680
<v Speaker 4>Without it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the feeling?</v>

2529
01:50:26.681 --> 01:50:28.240
<v Speaker 4>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you describe anxiety,</v>

2530
01:50:28.241 --> 01:50:29.030
<v Speaker 4>how would you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2531
01:50:29.530 --> 01:50:32.480
<v Speaker 4>how would you categorize it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like tap,</v>

2532
01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:34.750
<v Speaker 4>like emotional tap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dance,</v>

2533
01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:39.130
<v Speaker 4>just like jittery and always.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2534
01:50:39.131 --> 01:50:40.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never wait man.</v>

2535
01:50:40.630 --> 01:50:43.240
<v Speaker 4>I never waited for the moment because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd always take the pills.</v>

2536
01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:49.020
<v Speaker 4>So when did they find on stage please </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't not come because of this stage.</v>

2537
01:50:51.610 --> 01:50:54.700
<v Speaker 4>You're super calm and smooth and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>where I feel at home.</v>

2538
01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:55.750
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

2539
01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:58.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that for most people,</v>

2540
01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:01.840
<v Speaker 4>getting onstage and public speaking is </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the most terrifying things.</v>

2541
01:51:01.930 --> 01:51:02.650
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Honestly,</v>

2542
01:51:02.651 --> 01:51:05.860
<v Speaker 4>I think my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my pulse goes down when I'm on stage.</v>

2543
01:51:06.190 --> 01:51:11.190
<v Speaker 4>The only time in the last 15 years I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever like a little bit anxious was </v>

2544
01:51:12.731 --> 01:51:17.731
<v Speaker 4>Madison Square Garden would share </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was worried about the sound </v>

2545
01:51:17.731 --> 01:51:21.901
<v Speaker 4>system and the people in the back nine </v>
<v Speaker 4>here in me because I heard it was a </v>

2546
01:51:21.901 --> 01:51:25.051
<v Speaker 4>little screwy and my sister got a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>panicky about what about me on truth,</v>

2547
01:51:25.331 --> 01:51:30.331
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe you get to go up in </v>
<v Speaker 4>front of all these people and that kind </v>

2548
01:51:30.331 --> 01:51:32.391
<v Speaker 4>of got into my head and I didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>look up at the banners and stuff of the </v>

2549
01:51:32.391 --> 01:51:36.360
<v Speaker 4>Knicks and rangers and the history and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the garden and thinking Ali Frazier.</v>

2550
01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:39.220
<v Speaker 4>Sinatra was there and the Beatles were </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

2551
01:51:39.221 --> 01:51:40.570
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a lock up.</v>

2552
01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:46.100
<v Speaker 4>I was fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean I did have a glass of wine </v>

2553
01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:48.960
<v Speaker 4>and I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to set to be over the first </v>

2554
01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:48.960
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did it two nights a second.</v>

2555
01:51:49.210 --> 01:51:54.210
<v Speaker 4>It's so funny how relative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's because the next night if the </v>

2556
01:51:54.210 --> 01:51:55.780
<v Speaker 4>second set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were at the Pepsi Center in Denver,</v>

2557
01:51:55.810 --> 01:51:57.940
<v Speaker 4>which is bigger than the garden and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought,</v>

2558
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:59.440
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's good to be out of there.</v>

2559
01:51:59.470 --> 01:52:01.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm so relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so relieved.</v>

2560
01:52:02.610 --> 01:52:04.300
<v Speaker 4>Just the history of the garden fucked </v>
<v Speaker 4>with you.</v>

2561
01:52:04.330 --> 01:52:05.050
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it did.</v>

2562
01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:07.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started letting it creep into my head.</v>

2563
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:09.000
<v Speaker 4>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you opened for Whitney Houston to.</v>

2564
01:52:09.790 --> 01:52:12.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was not fun.</v>

2565
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:13.630
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2566
01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:15.580
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't he know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She never talked to me.</v>

2567
01:52:15.581 --> 01:52:19.750
<v Speaker 4>She had bouncers around her and I say a </v>
<v Speaker 4>prayer and I thought,</v>

2568
01:52:19.751 --> 01:52:24.751
<v Speaker 4>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if Jesus had 300 pound </v>

2569
01:52:24.751 --> 01:52:24.751
<v Speaker 4>bouncers.</v>

2570
01:52:24.751 --> 01:52:25.300
<v Speaker 4>Think their mostly like fisherman who </v>
<v Speaker 4>were kind of thin wafer.</v>

2571
01:52:26.170 --> 01:52:28.420
<v Speaker 4>And her father was a great guy and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>

2572
01:52:28.421 --> 01:52:30.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm lucky to work on my daughter again.</v>

2573
01:52:30.671 --> 01:52:31.980
<v Speaker 4>This is really going well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I says,</v>

2574
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:36.990
<v Speaker 4>well thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking there's no way I'm working </v>

2575
01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:39.301
<v Speaker 4>with her again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she would come in late her and she </v>

2576
01:52:39.301 --> 01:52:40.120
<v Speaker 4>was with Bobby Brown already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They come in one night.</v>

2577
01:52:40.121 --> 01:52:44.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm on stage for 45 minutes at the sands</v>
<v Speaker 4>killing and uh,</v>

2578
01:52:45.170 --> 01:52:46.550
<v Speaker 4>and I told the audience and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2579
01:52:46.551 --> 01:52:48.320
<v Speaker 4>I gotta tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's not here.</v>

2580
01:52:48.710 --> 01:52:51.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't want you to think because you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good cook because I'm from Philly.</v>

2581
01:52:51.201 --> 01:52:52.770
<v Speaker 4>And it was like Lennox city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2582
01:52:52.910 --> 01:52:55.550
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them knew me already and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

2583
01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:57.860
<v Speaker 4>she's not here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to leave you in the dark.</v>

2584
01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:00.750
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm staying on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not being self indulgent.</v>

2585
01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:02.020
<v Speaker 4>And they start cheering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2586
01:53:02.330 --> 01:53:04.610
<v Speaker 4>I was really doing it for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

2587
01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then she finally came.</v>

2588
01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:08.420
<v Speaker 4>But how long did he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long did you stay on stage?</v>

2589
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:12.130
<v Speaker 4>40 slash 40 slash 50 minutes on crowd </v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

2590
01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:13.250
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't do any.</v>

2591
01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:14.750
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was lucky that was philly though.</v>

2592
01:53:15.250 --> 01:53:17.000
<v Speaker 4>A place where you could do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Philly.</v>

2593
01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:22.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the thing is you have to tell </v>

2594
01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:22.060
<v Speaker 4>them if they were upset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2595
01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:22.430
<v Speaker 4>I would have gotten off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2596
01:53:22.670 --> 01:53:24.610
<v Speaker 4>the only time I had trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2597
01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:27.440
<v Speaker 4>with a big crowd was in Dayton,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ohio,</v>

2598
01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:30.710
<v Speaker 4>because they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they really fucking hated me.</v>

2599
01:53:30.711 --> 01:53:32.780
<v Speaker 4>They hated me so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They came to Cleveland,</v>

2600
01:53:32.781 --> 01:53:34.010
<v Speaker 4>the Boomi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's serious,</v>

2601
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:36.440
<v Speaker 4>but they couldn't get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see he's still here,</v>

2602
01:53:36.441 --> 01:53:39.060
<v Speaker 4>but you still can't get good seats that </v>
<v Speaker 4>were in the backbone.</v>

2603
01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:44.200
<v Speaker 4>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they hated you so bad that came to </v>

2604
01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:44.200
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

2605
01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:44.200
<v Speaker 4>Here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2606
01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:46.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're probably coming it </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably show fans coming to see her and</v>

2607
01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:51.720
<v Speaker 4>then generally her crowd was so eclectic</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it was easy to do stand up for it </v>

2608
01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:53.060
<v Speaker 4>because she doesn't get like a rock and </v>
<v Speaker 4>roll crowd.</v>

2609
01:53:53.061 --> 01:53:55.640
<v Speaker 4>It's not like quiet riot or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2613
01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:05.840
<v Speaker 4>People forget she won an academy award.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's also an emmy award.</v>

2614
01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:08.570
<v Speaker 4>Bad Ass straight career.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And then finally I lost my patient.</v>

01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:52.820
<v Speaker 4>Well I got upset with me and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2635
01:54:52.850 --> 01:54:54.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she's fucking annoying,</v>

2636
01:54:55.480 --> 01:55:00.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was my only really bad </v>

2637
01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:00.860
<v Speaker 4>experience and it's pretty tough when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you lose an arena.</v>

2638
01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:04.550
<v Speaker 4>It ain't like we lose in 300 people at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy club and getting them back.</v>

2639
01:55:04.551 --> 01:55:07.030
<v Speaker 4>When you lose an arena,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like to let the.</v>

2640
01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:10.400
<v Speaker 4>Well it's a real problem when no one </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to see you,</v>

2641
01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:11.680
<v Speaker 4>then they're there to see some.</v>

2642
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:13.370
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She put me on the bill,</v>

2643
01:55:13.730 --> 01:55:16.070
<v Speaker 4>which really made it classy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't like,</v>

2644
01:55:16.071 --> 01:55:17.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>special guests or anything.</v>

2645
01:55:17.831 --> 01:55:22.831
<v Speaker 4>It was like dom opening act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what happened to Kurt Fox </v>

2646
01:55:22.831 --> 01:55:24.510
<v Speaker 4>recently with Charlie Sheen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that?</v>

2647
01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:27.710
<v Speaker 4>Watch the video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They gave him a chance.</v>

2648
01:55:27.711 --> 01:55:29.990
<v Speaker 4>He a dick up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They gave him a chance.</v>

2649
01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:31.640
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I disagree.</v>

2650
01:55:31.641 --> 01:55:32.830
<v Speaker 4>I watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They weren't yet.</v>

2651
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:34.640
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that they weren't really dare</v>

2652
01:55:34.641 --> 01:55:35.780
<v Speaker 4>to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>

2653
01:55:35.810 --> 01:55:37.580
<v Speaker 4>they were down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they gave him a chance,</v>

2654
01:55:37.581 --> 01:55:40.520
<v Speaker 4>they gave him a chance and he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>come with any jokes that that's not,</v>

2655
01:55:40.530 --> 01:55:42.020
<v Speaker 4>that's not what happened in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>

2656
01:55:42.230 --> 01:55:44.050
<v Speaker 4>I think curt will admit to that he</v>

2657
01:55:44.050 --> 01:55:46.320
<v Speaker 5>just didn't work well when we had him on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the podcast.</v>

2658
01:55:46.321 --> 01:55:49.100
<v Speaker 5>A I sort of an ironic sense of humor and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a.</v>

2659
01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:51.710
<v Speaker 5>he's got a good delivery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think he requires a,</v>

2660
01:55:51.711 --> 01:55:52.840
<v Speaker 5>an attentive audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2661
01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:57.860
<v Speaker 5>but he also said on the podcast we had a</v>
<v Speaker 5>death squad that that when he came out </v>

2662
01:55:57.860 --> 01:56:01.221
<v Speaker 5>that the people didn't know what to </v>
<v Speaker 5>expect and so he came out and just </v>

2663
01:56:01.531 --> 01:56:03.600
<v Speaker 5>started doing comedy and people </v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately when you came out,</v>

2664
01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:05.690
<v Speaker 5>start going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who books with Ms Dot troubleshooting.</v>

2665
01:56:06.210 --> 01:56:07.530
<v Speaker 5>That's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2666
01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:10.760
<v Speaker 5>Well that's him being a rookie in these.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2667
01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:13.850
<v Speaker 5>Sheena.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some dudes just sitting there talking.</v>

2668
01:56:13.890 --> 01:56:16.770
<v Speaker 5>That's what you were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's him being a rookie.</v>

2669
01:56:16.771 --> 01:56:21.771
<v Speaker 5>You have to address that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're hired as a comedian to go on </v>

2670
01:56:21.771 --> 01:56:22.480
<v Speaker 5>stage in front of Charlie Sheen and no </v>
<v Speaker 5>one knows what the fuck is going on.</v>

2671
01:56:22.481 --> 01:56:25.140
<v Speaker 5>This is the first show you guys have </v>
<v Speaker 5>done and that's what happened.</v>

2672
01:56:25.290 --> 01:56:27.990
<v Speaker 5>You got to go onstage and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to set them up.</v>

2673
01:56:27.991 --> 01:56:29.570
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the Fuck Charles is </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to do it.</v>

2674
01:56:29.590 --> 01:56:34.590
<v Speaker 5>I think there was one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like Tennessee want to handle that or </v>

2675
01:56:34.590 --> 01:56:34.590
<v Speaker 5>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's really at this stage</v>

2676
01:56:34.590 --> 01:56:35.230
<v Speaker 10>who's here to say Charlie Sheen?</v>

2677
01:56:36.090 --> 01:56:41.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's really bad if you're not on </v>

2678
01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:41.090
<v Speaker 5>the bill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2679
01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:41.520
<v Speaker 5>it's very classy and we share was </v>
<v Speaker 5>classy.</v>

2680
01:56:41.530 --> 01:56:46.530
<v Speaker 5>You know stacy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the dame had Claire C and I think there </v>

2681
01:56:46.530 --> 01:56:47.520
<v Speaker 5>was something else that like they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>waiting.</v>

2682
01:56:47.550 --> 01:56:52.550
<v Speaker 5>They were waiting for a long time and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was really late and I'm sure,</v>

2683
01:56:53.881 --> 01:56:55.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there's a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

2684
01:56:55.681 --> 01:57:00.681
<v Speaker 5>you've got to learn how to use.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're going to open for a guy like </v>

2685
01:57:00.681 --> 01:57:02.100
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to have some fucking rock solid</v>

2686
01:57:02.101 --> 01:57:07.101
<v Speaker 5>material.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or what did he think was going to </v>

2687
01:57:07.101 --> 01:57:07.101
<v Speaker 5>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

2688
01:57:07.101 --> 01:57:09.980
<v Speaker 5>what did you think was gonna happen when</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was going to write an act that </v>

2689
01:57:09.980 --> 01:57:09.980
<v Speaker 5>quickly?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2690
01:57:09.980 --> 01:57:10.170
<v Speaker 5>that's what he wants to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you want to do?</v>

2691
01:57:10.171 --> 01:57:15.171
<v Speaker 5>And his brain comedians with them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know Russell Peters did a couple of </v>

2692
01:57:15.171 --> 01:57:15.171
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We did Toronto with them and a few other</v>

2693
01:57:15.171 --> 01:57:15.720
<v Speaker 5>places I think as well.</v>

2694
01:57:15.930 --> 01:57:20.930
<v Speaker 5>And they would go up on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Russell would sit down with them and </v>

2695
01:57:20.930 --> 01:57:21.150
<v Speaker 5>Charlie would interview.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2696
01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:22.710
<v Speaker 5>Russell would interview Charlie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2697
01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:26.070
<v Speaker 5>talk to them and then crack a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>jokes along the way and you know,</v>

2698
01:57:26.071 --> 01:57:28.050
<v Speaker 5>Russell's great at that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Russell,</v>

2699
01:57:28.090 --> 01:57:30.060
<v Speaker 5>so fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a great guy,</v>

<v Speaker 5>And he's a,</v>

2701

<v Speaker 5>it's so funny.</v>

2702
01:57:32.401 --> 01:57:34.590
<v Speaker 5>Every time I sit next to an Asian </v>
<v Speaker 5>person,</v>

2703
01:57:35.070 --> 01:57:38.880
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm talking about Asia from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cambodia to Pakistan.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I think it was two nights in a row in </v>

<v Speaker 5>London.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they did.</v>

01:58:04.351 --> 01:58:05.130
<v Speaker 5>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

<v Speaker 5>And then he did the same thing to a door</v>

01:58:22.710 --> 01:58:24.650
<v Speaker 5>He brings a mitogen on the road with </v>
<v Speaker 5>them too.</v>

01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:33.480
<v Speaker 5>He's a real good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of good people in comedy.</v>

2726
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:38.750
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an interesting thing about </v>

2727
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:40.530
<v Speaker 5>comedians and becoming friends with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of them and you know,</v>

2728
01:58:40.531 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 5>it's like have to get the greatest</v>

2729
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:43.580
<v Speaker 4>people to communicate with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2730
01:58:43.610 --> 01:58:46.150
<v Speaker 4>cracks me up when people don't know that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're really friends.</v>

2731
01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:48.370
<v Speaker 4>Like they think we're in constant </v>
<v Speaker 4>competition.</v>

2732
01:58:48.371 --> 01:58:51.130
<v Speaker 4>My competition is with me trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

2733
01:58:51.370 --> 01:58:54.550
<v Speaker 4>It's like somebody said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean to offend you,</v>

2734
01:58:54.551 --> 01:58:57.460
<v Speaker 4>but I really like Robin Williams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2735
01:58:57.461 --> 01:58:58.210
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're allowed to.</v>

2736
01:58:58.211 --> 01:59:03.211
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think somebody even said </v>

2737
01:59:03.211 --> 01:59:03.211
<v Speaker 4>that about or about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't mean to offend you.</v>

2739
01:59:04.690 --> 01:59:06.670
<v Speaker 4>Offend me.</v>

2740
01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:08.210
<v Speaker 4>I think he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2741
01:59:08.710 --> 01:59:11.890
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I carry comedy on my back and it</v>

2742
01:59:11.891 --> 01:59:14.190
<v Speaker 4>had there you insult me by liking </v>
<v Speaker 4>another comedian.</v>

2743
01:59:14.191 --> 01:59:14.570
<v Speaker 4>It'd be a lot of</v>

2744
01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:15.490
<v Speaker 3>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Him.</v>

2745
01:59:15.710 --> 01:59:17.610
<v Speaker 3>You've always been a supporter of </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians.</v>

2746
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:21.130
<v Speaker 3>You were always great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gave me great advice when,</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You don't care?</v>

2785
02:00:58.810 --> 02:00:59.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck.</v>

2786
02:01:01.010 --> 02:01:02.420
<v Speaker 4>That's the only.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing.</v>

2787
02:01:02.421 --> 02:01:04.730
<v Speaker 4>The only reason I would like to be gay </v>
<v Speaker 4>is just to come out.</v>

2788
02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:10.710
<v Speaker 11>They don't give a fuck,</v>

2789
02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:14.740
<v Speaker 4>but I mean I'm not gay because I like </v>
<v Speaker 4>women so much but it would be like I was</v>

2790
02:01:14.741 --> 02:01:19.741
<v Speaker 4>thinking about it even at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way I look now and this is what's </v>

2791
02:01:19.741 --> 02:01:23.470
<v Speaker 4>great about show business and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that I couldn't be gay if I wanted to</v>

2792
02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:28.740
<v Speaker 4>because I couldn't ever get guys as good</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking as the girls like it because </v>

2793
02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:31.681
<v Speaker 4>guys are more superficial and into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you can get girls because they like </v>

2794
02:01:31.681 --> 02:01:32.160
<v Speaker 4>talent and money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2795
02:01:32.161 --> 02:01:34.570
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy who,</v>

2796
02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:37.330
<v Speaker 4>the guy who got thrown back into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>closet,</v>

2797
02:01:37.780 --> 02:01:39.920
<v Speaker 4>we don't need you out here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>

2798
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:45.280
<v Speaker 3>I would like to be gay just so I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>come out just so you can say it.</v>

2799
02:01:47.051 --> 02:01:48.680
<v Speaker 3>You don't give a fuck where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>surprised when Kevin,</v>

2800
02:01:48.681 --> 02:01:51.910
<v Speaker 3>me and he came out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like in his fifties show how many</v>

2801
02:01:51.970 --> 02:01:53.310

2802
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:55.970
<v Speaker 3>There's only a certain amount of show </v>
<v Speaker 3>tunes you can sing.</v>

2803
02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Not Be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was surprised with todd glass.</v>

2804
02:02:01.650 --> 02:02:04.790
<v Speaker 3>I was as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You weren't surprised but I have a thing</v>

2805
02:02:04.791 --> 02:02:09.791
<v Speaker 3>on my phone of tagless talking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll let you hear drunk.</v>

2806
02:02:10.420 --> 02:02:10.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2807
02:02:10.791 --> 02:02:11.300
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2808
02:02:11.301 --> 02:02:16.301
<v Speaker 3>I offended him and he called to </v>
<v Speaker 3>reconcile it and the Florida radio </v>

2809
02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:20.840
<v Speaker 3>station called me to bust his balls and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize what I was saying was.</v>

2810
02:02:20.910 --> 02:02:23.300
<v Speaker 3>And I like todd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never want to hurt him,</v>

2811
02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:26.150
<v Speaker 3>but I was saying that he says you never </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought I was funny,</v>

2812
02:02:26.210 --> 02:02:26.570
<v Speaker 3>didn't you?</v>

2813
02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:30.170
<v Speaker 3>I said I always thought you were funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean not like laugh out loud.</v>

2814
02:02:30.171 --> 02:02:31.430
<v Speaker 3>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2815
02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:35.330
<v Speaker 3>like he never going to go in and see it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go.</v>

2816
02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:36.710
<v Speaker 3>My stomach hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2817
02:02:36.711 --> 02:02:37.960
<v Speaker 3>you were funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you liked these,</v>

2818
02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:40.700
<v Speaker 3>the Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wednesday and Sunday headliner,</v>

2819
02:02:41.150 --> 02:02:46.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't know it but that's what he </v>

2820
02:02:46.150 --> 02:02:48.161
<v Speaker 3>was doing that weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was crushing him and he's a very </v>

2821
02:02:48.161 --> 02:02:49.910
<v Speaker 3>sensitive guy and if he hears just be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's this.</v>

2822
02:02:49.911 --> 02:02:52.710
<v Speaker 3>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was just joking around.</v>

2823
02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:54.360
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know I was hitting on some </v>
<v Speaker 3>pumps,</v>

2824
02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:55.670
<v Speaker 3>sore points,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2825
02:02:55.700 --> 02:03:00.700
<v Speaker 3>todd glass called me up after them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>see if things somehow or another we got </v>

2826
02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:02.200
<v Speaker 3>on the phone together and he was one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2827
02:03:02.210 --> 02:03:02.870
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2828
02:03:02.871 --> 02:03:04.910
<v Speaker 3>a lot of comedians were happy after that</v>
<v Speaker 3>went down.</v>

2829
02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:10.120
<v Speaker 3>But todd and I really didn't know each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other very well and he was so </v>

2830
02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:12.440
<v Speaker 3>enthusiastic and happy and he just said </v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

2831
02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:15.050
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just thank you for doing it.</v>

2832
02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:20.080
<v Speaker 3>And he dropped to his knees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad now in retrospect that I didn't</v>

2833
02:03:20.961 --> 02:03:25.670
<v Speaker 3>give a big long hug and both of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents are retired and go crazy.</v>

2834
02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:29.600
<v Speaker 3>Both of my parents are care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay recharge.</v>

2835
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:30.380
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2836
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:32.930
<v Speaker 3>there was a few people that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinated by it,</v>

2837
02:03:32.931 --> 02:03:36.510
<v Speaker 3>but he was super thankful and I talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

2838
02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:37.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2839
02:03:38.150 --> 02:03:40.640
<v Speaker 3>kindler and I briefly said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2840
02:03:40.641 --> 02:03:43.220
<v Speaker 3>we're like maybe there should be some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a fucking comedians union,</v>

2841
02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:44.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shouldn't be a union.</v>

2842
02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:49.160
<v Speaker 3>They tried it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tried it in New York with the was.</v>

2843
02:03:49.210 --> 02:03:51.170
<v Speaker 3>But that was about like pay at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>clubs,</v>

2844
02:03:51.171 --> 02:03:52.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it was about?</v>

2845
02:03:52.190 --> 02:03:52.750
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2846
02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:57.550
<v Speaker 3>it was past that it was about a health </v>
<v Speaker 3>insurance and joining a unionized.</v>

2847
02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:00.110
<v Speaker 3>But it's tough when everybody's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition with each other for,</v>

2848
02:04:00.740 --> 02:04:01.430
<v Speaker 3>for jobs.</v>

2849
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:04.850
<v Speaker 3>I think the only place it would work is </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know,</v>

2850
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:07.310
<v Speaker 3>when you have to get rid of fees that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2851
02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:12.340
<v Speaker 3>that is when having comedians together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people don't understand the issue </v>

2852
02:04:12.340 --> 02:04:14.420
<v Speaker 3>behind thievery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why there was a lot of people</v>

2853
02:04:14.421 --> 02:04:17.780
<v Speaker 3>that thought that what I did was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>douchey and when we released that Carlos</v>

2854
02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:22.840
<v Speaker 3>video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you have someone who is being </v>

2855
02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:25.960
<v Speaker 3>unchecked and they're doing well and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just running through the comedy </v>

2856
02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:26.120
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people don't understand what that's</v>

2857
02:04:26.121 --> 02:04:31.121
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're working with someone </v>

2858
02:04:31.121 --> 02:04:32.770
<v Speaker 3>who just might steal your car and no one</v>
<v Speaker 3>else that you work with is going to do </v>

2859
02:04:32.770 --> 02:04:33.710
<v Speaker 3>shit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy just going to steal your car.</v>

2860

<v Speaker 3>a vinyl roof on it.</v>

2897

<v Speaker 3>Mazda had a hell of a car in that rx </v>
<v Speaker 3>seven to like one of the last models </v>

2919

<v Speaker 3>John Merera doesn't even have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>navigation system.</v>

2922
02:07:20.450 --> 02:07:21.480
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2923
02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:23.630
<v Speaker 3>I tell them I wouldn't be able to figure</v>
<v Speaker 3>it out anyway.</v>

2924
02:07:24.170 --> 02:07:29.010
<v Speaker 3>You're burning it up and so reduce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Susie has the navigation.</v>

2925
02:07:29.650 --> 02:07:32.520
<v Speaker 3>Then he used to have as far as like you </v>

2928
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:42.970
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable and I was getting like</v>

2929
02:07:42.971 --> 02:07:47.971
<v Speaker 3>jeeves from getting thrown back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I tried to act normal heads hitting </v>

2930
02:07:47.971 --> 02:07:52.051
<v Speaker 3>the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the most cathartic thing about this </v>

2931
02:07:52.051 --> 02:07:52.051
<v Speaker 3>whole experience was I finally got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you,</v>

2932
02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:53.480
<v Speaker 3>I was afraid of the pimples.</v>

2933
02:07:55.050 --> 02:08:00.050
<v Speaker 3>I told you without reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never wanted you to think and I never </v>

2934
02:08:00.050 --> 02:08:02.590
<v Speaker 3>had the heart to tell you that I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to come to your house.</v>

2935
02:08:03.850 --> 02:08:05.140
<v Speaker 3>Not a pushy person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2936
02:08:05.141 --> 02:08:05.820
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2937
02:08:05.970 --> 02:08:08.650
<v Speaker 3>there's always a need coming into </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood shooting pool with me.</v>

2938
02:08:08.651 --> 02:08:11.290
<v Speaker 3>There was no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nice to get that off my chest.</v>

2939
02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:16.320
<v Speaker 3>Just finally admitted that even that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were shooting and those doors were </v>

2940
02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:18.070
<v Speaker 3>just walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just solid muscle and teeth.</v>

2941
02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:21.150
<v Speaker 3>Fucking jaws of death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ernest sweeties.</v>

2942
02:08:21.190 --> 02:08:22.840
<v Speaker 3>I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's always that.</v>

2943
02:08:22.841 --> 02:08:26.290
<v Speaker 3>One time I will wait to meet Johnny </v>
<v Speaker 3>cash.</v>

2944
02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:28.450
<v Speaker 3>Johnny cash is my master.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a sweetheart.</v>

2945
02:08:28.510 --> 02:08:29.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's outside.</v>

2946
02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:31.690
<v Speaker 3>He's nice dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's way bigger than the pimples,</v>

2947
02:08:31.691 --> 02:08:34.040
<v Speaker 3>so maybe I met him another time blocking</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2948
02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:35.920
<v Speaker 3>That's a big dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made them another.</v>

2949
02:08:35.930 --> 02:08:37.600
<v Speaker 3>He's so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

2950
02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:39.520
<v Speaker 3>I've never had a dog that's as strong as</v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

2951
02:08:39.730 --> 02:08:42.790
<v Speaker 3>It's a dog where you read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if he lunges for something,</v>

2952
02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:48.000
<v Speaker 3>I got a drop down and dig in with both </v>
<v Speaker 3>my feet and hang on a horse.</v>

2953
02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:48.970
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem.</v>

2954
02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:51.110
<v Speaker 3>He's going to know I'm afraid of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2955
02:08:51.190 --> 02:08:52.630
<v Speaker 3>he's a sweetheart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he knows.</v>

2956
02:08:52.631 --> 02:08:53.600
<v Speaker 3>They sense it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2957
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:58.750
<v Speaker 3>but trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to go right from my mastiffs </v>

2958
02:08:58.750 --> 02:09:02.880
<v Speaker 3>is they're very confident because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not worried about you at all </v>

2959
02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:03.310
<v Speaker 3>masters and never worried about a person</v>
<v Speaker 3>beating their ass.</v>

2960
02:09:03.311 --> 02:09:07.030
<v Speaker 3>They just the headmasters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're so confident,</v>

2961
02:09:07.090 --> 02:09:09.880
<v Speaker 3>they're so big and so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are very nice,</v>

2962
02:09:10.210 --> 02:09:11.860
<v Speaker 3>like they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not insecure.</v>

2963
02:09:11.861 --> 02:09:16.861
<v Speaker 3>Like there's certain certain dogs that </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like they have to establish </v>

2964
02:09:16.861 --> 02:09:17.590
<v Speaker 3>dominance over person or scare a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mastiffs.</v>

2965
02:09:17.591 --> 02:09:19.420
<v Speaker 3>They're not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they're barking at you,</v>

2966
02:09:19.421 --> 02:09:24.421
<v Speaker 3>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a massive is angry at you and </v>

<v Speaker 3>big.</v>

2969
02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:30.670
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about 150 to 200 pound </v>
<v Speaker 3>dog.</v>

2970
02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:34.450
<v Speaker 3>Do you know how strong that fucking let </v>
<v Speaker 3>those dogs and with the kids.</v>

2971

<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but that I'm sure enough to have them </v>

2973
02:09:41.310 --> 02:09:41.500
<v Speaker 3>around kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can't trust the dog around kids,</v>

2974
02:09:41.501 --> 02:09:44.260
<v Speaker 3>you can't have that dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dog's exhibit.</v>

2975
02:09:44.261 --> 02:09:46.300
<v Speaker 3>No aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have two masters?</v>

2976
02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:48.400
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one's a bulldog mix.</v>

2977
02:09:48.490 --> 02:09:51.280
<v Speaker 3>He's a very lazy dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's a sweetheart too.</v>

2978
02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:52.930
<v Speaker 3>They're both real nice dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2979
02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:55.180
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know anything about the Honda Crx</v>

2980
02:09:55.190 --> 02:09:57.910
<v Speaker 3>z?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that that a hybrid thing?</v>

2981
02:09:58.290 --> 02:10:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Hybrid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw one the other day and it was </v>

2982
02:10:03.290 --> 02:10:03.290
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looked like a spaceship go.</v>

2983
02:10:03.290 --> 02:10:04.920
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen what they're doing now in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a car?</v>

2984
02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:06.720
<v Speaker 3>They're putting stitcher in a gang of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>

2985
02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:09.520
<v Speaker 3>Going to be in BMW's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>BMW's.</v>

2986
02:10:09.521 --> 02:10:14.521
<v Speaker 3>It's forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a all the big guys and now they </v>

2987
02:10:14.521 --> 02:10:14.980
<v Speaker 3>also have three g on here and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said the other day,</v>

2988
02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:17.290
<v Speaker 3>this new ipad has the four g light on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2989
02:10:17.291 --> 02:10:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Verizon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2990
02:10:18.071 --> 02:10:21.850
<v Speaker 3>It's faster than my business clash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A charter at my studio.</v>

2991
02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:23.620
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got four G,</v>

2992
02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:26.080
<v Speaker 3>a car that I put in my laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty happy with it.</v>

2993
02:10:26.081 --> 02:10:28.420
<v Speaker 3>When you actually get a four g </v>
<v Speaker 3>connection on the road.</v>

2994
02:10:28.421 --> 02:10:33.421
<v Speaker 3>It's a little sketchy though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's always better than the shit </v>

2995
02:10:33.421 --> 02:10:34.070
<v Speaker 3>that's in the hotel room if you've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2996
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:39.070
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about their fucking virus </v>

2997
02:10:39.070 --> 02:10:39.070
<v Speaker 1>that we both thought we got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2998
02:10:39.070 --> 02:10:39.830
<v Speaker 1>so don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the flashback virus.</v>

2999
02:10:39.831 --> 02:10:42.530
<v Speaker 1>If you're using a Mac and you think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get a Trojan,</v>

3000
02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:44.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not really a virus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Trojan.</v>

3001
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:48.590
<v Speaker 1>It's an exploit through Java and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess.</v>

3002
02:10:48.591 --> 02:10:52.790
<v Speaker 1>It only works if you don't have your </v>
<v Speaker 1>Java updated to the latest and greatest.</v>

3003
02:10:52.830 --> 02:10:53.340
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you.</v>

3004
02:10:53.341 --> 02:10:55.290
<v Speaker 7>If you're one of those people that keep </v>
<v Speaker 7>your shit updated,</v>

3005
02:10:55.291 --> 02:10:56.820
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're really not going to have to worry</v>

3006
02:10:56.821 --> 02:10:58.230
<v Speaker 7>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That though.</v>

3007
02:10:58.231 --> 02:10:59.370
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Also,</v>

3008
02:10:59.380 --> 02:11:04.380
<v Speaker 7>it's also it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's only if you go to some really </v>

3009
02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:05.790
<v Speaker 7>sketchy website,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the more I read about it and also just a</v>

3010
02:11:05.791 --> 02:11:10.791
<v Speaker 7>way to test it to see if you have it and</v>
<v Speaker 7>I tested mine and I go to the filthiest </v>

3011
02:11:10.791 --> 02:11:12.750
<v Speaker 7>fucking places in the world and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 7>have it.</v>

3012
02:11:12.751 --> 02:11:15.330
<v Speaker 7>I mean I did look at torrent websites.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What do you do?</v>

3013
02:11:15.650 --> 02:11:17.780
<v Speaker 7>You open up terminal and you have to cut</v>
<v Speaker 7>and paste this.</v>

3014
02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:19.710
<v Speaker 7>A couple of different lines of code in </v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

3015
02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:22.320
<v Speaker 7>The easiest way to to actually figure it</v>
<v Speaker 7>out.</v>

3016
02:11:22.321 --> 02:11:26.670
<v Speaker 7>If you go to a nine to five.com,</v>
<v Speaker 7>our Mac nine to five.com.</v>

3017
02:11:26.671 --> 02:11:28.590
<v Speaker 7>What is that website,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right Mac?</v>

3018
02:11:28.591 --> 02:11:33.591
<v Speaker 7>Nine to five.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was if you just googled Mac virus </v>

3019
02:11:33.591 --> 02:11:36.880
<v Speaker 7>will come up with a couple pages and </v>
<v Speaker 7>there's links to the code that you cut </v>

3020
02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:41.430
<v Speaker 7>and paste into your browser and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 7>nine to five Mac.com</v>

3021
02:11:41.431 --> 02:11:45.600
<v Speaker 7>is the one that I saw at on and it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>pretty much you just type in these codes</v>

3022
02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:47.750
<v Speaker 7>and if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if it,</v>

3023
02:11:47.820 --> 02:11:52.820
<v Speaker 7>it tells you what to look for and what </v>
<v Speaker 7>not to look for to tell you if you have </v>

3024
02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:52.820
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

3025
02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:52.820
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>honestly,</v>

3026
02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:56.961
<v Speaker 7>the only thing you really have to do is </v>
<v Speaker 7>just open up your little apple on the </v>

3027
02:11:56.961 --> 02:11:56.961
<v Speaker 7>left hand corner,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hit,</v>

3028
02:11:56.961 --> 02:12:01.140
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hit it and then go to system update and </v>

3029
02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:01.140
<v Speaker 7>there's a Java update,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3030
02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:03.330
<v Speaker 7>in that if you have that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we'll patch it.</v>

3031
02:12:03.331 --> 02:12:05.820
<v Speaker 7>And if it's not in there already,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean check to make sure you have it.</v>

3032
02:12:05.821 --> 02:12:10.821
<v Speaker 7>Then you must have already done some </v>
<v Speaker 7>people say you shouldn't have Java on </v>

3033
02:12:10.821 --> 02:12:11.100
<v Speaker 7>your browser.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You should enabled the problem.</v>

3034
02:12:11.670 --> 02:12:14.190
<v Speaker 7>The problem is is yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well when you go to any kind of,</v>

3035
02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:16.890
<v Speaker 7>when you first get your laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you first get your Mac,</v>

3036
02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:19.080
<v Speaker 7>that's the one of the first things that </v>
<v Speaker 7>comes up.</v>

3037
02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:21.450
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>would you like to Install Java?</v>

3038
02:12:21.570 --> 02:12:24.930
<v Speaker 7>Like is not a part of the operating </v>
<v Speaker 7>system is not a part of windows.</v>

3039
02:12:25.290 --> 02:12:28.280
<v Speaker 7>It's a third party thing that you add to</v>
<v Speaker 7>your browser.</v>

3040
02:12:28.610 --> 02:12:30.210
<v Speaker 7>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's a plugin.</v>

3041
02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:35.390
<v Speaker 7>Like I just had it turned off on this </v>
<v Speaker 7>laptop over here and I tried to go to </v>

3042
02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:38.661
<v Speaker 7>that Honda website and it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The Honda website didn't work because I </v>

3043
02:12:38.661 --> 02:12:39.330
<v Speaker 7>didn't have a job enabled so I enabled </v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

3044
02:12:39.331 --> 02:12:40.780
<v Speaker 7>Now it works.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I checked the,</v>

3045
02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:44.940
<v Speaker 7>this laptop and his Mac or this Imac.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You updated it last night.</v>

3046
02:12:44.941 --> 02:12:48.700
<v Speaker 7>So it's everything's cool and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you're looking at.</v>

3047
02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:52.200
<v Speaker 7>If you go to nine to five Mac.com</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you look at the map that,</v>

3048
02:12:52.500 --> 02:12:57.500
<v Speaker 7>that like who's infected,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know there is a lot of people </v>

3049
02:12:57.500 --> 02:13:00.591
<v Speaker 7>infected but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're talking about rural to Ra </v>

3050
02:13:00.591 --> 02:13:00.591
<v Speaker 7>worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Will did.</v>

02:13:00.591 --> 02:13:03.820
<v Speaker 7>Rolled Don verus say that he had </v>
<v Speaker 7>someone,</v>

3052
02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:09.000
<v Speaker 7>Don dot Mary's had a meltdown last night</v>
<v Speaker 7>on the stage because he had his facebook</v>

3053
02:13:10.381 --> 02:13:13.860
<v Speaker 7>hacked and his gmail hack.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So then he went in there and changed all</v>

3054
02:13:13.861 --> 02:13:18.861
<v Speaker 7>this shit and then they hacked it again </v>
<v Speaker 7>and he pretty much on stage was like,</v>

3055
02:13:19.231 --> 02:13:19.920
<v Speaker 7>you know what I give up.</v>

3077
02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:15.291
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think of that when I'm jerking off on </v>

3078
02:14:15.291 --> 02:14:15.291
<v Speaker 7>the couch and there's porns leapt out if</v>
<v Speaker 7>I died,</v>

3079
02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:17.600
<v Speaker 7>like who would walk in and see what,</v>

3082
02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:24.870
<v Speaker 7>imagine the whole Internet being able to</v>
<v Speaker 7>do that to your computer,</v>

3083
02:14:24.871 --> 02:14:27.240
<v Speaker 7>not your mom,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not your fucking girlfriend.</v>

3084
02:14:27.250 --> 02:14:32.250
<v Speaker 7>Looking at your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now imagine the whole Internet being </v>

3085
02:14:32.250 --> 02:14:32.250
<v Speaker 7>able to access your computer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's fucking terrifying.</v>

3086
02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:34.240
<v Speaker 7>It was terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3087
02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:36.870
<v Speaker 7>it's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I really think that,</v>

3088
02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:38.010
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we talked about,</v>

3089
02:14:38.011 --> 02:14:39.360
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with everlast the other day,</v>

3090
02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:42.720
<v Speaker 7>we're like secrets or on the way out at </v>
<v Speaker 7>a certain point in time,</v>

3091
02:14:42.721 --> 02:14:44.950
<v Speaker 7>everything you do online,</v>
<v Speaker 7>someone's going to be able to read it.</v>

3092
02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:49.170
<v Speaker 7>Someone's going to be able to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 7>your phone calls are going to be able to</v>

3093
02:14:49.171 --> 02:14:49.830
<v Speaker 7>access.</v>

3094
02:14:49.860 --> 02:14:51.210
<v Speaker 7>That's what I said last night.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

3095
02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:52.080
<v Speaker 7>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3096
02:14:52.081 --> 02:14:57.081
<v Speaker 7>there's like at least seven people in </v>
<v Speaker 7>New Zealand right now listening to this </v>

3097
02:14:57.081 --> 02:14:57.810
<v Speaker 7>phone call that are ahead of us in </v>
<v Speaker 7>technology that can.</v>

3098
02:14:57.811 --> 02:15:00.390
<v Speaker 7>It's probably boring tiger woods with a </v>
<v Speaker 7>great example,</v>

3099
02:15:00.391 --> 02:15:02.400
<v Speaker 7>like when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 7>baseball players,</v>

3100
02:15:02.401 --> 02:15:07.401
<v Speaker 7>they'll cheat on their wives,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the sports writers knew what they </v>

3101
02:15:07.401 --> 02:15:07.401
<v Speaker 7>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They didn't rat him out.</v>

3102
02:15:07.401 --> 02:15:08.910
<v Speaker 7>But today's world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3103
02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:11.430
<v Speaker 7>they traced down everything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3104
02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:12.690
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and he wouldn't,</v>

3105
02:15:12.691 --> 02:15:16.940
<v Speaker 7>he wouldn't even been in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What Michael Jordan probably did is,</v>

3106
02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:18.540
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>double that.</v>

3107
02:15:18.570 --> 02:15:23.570
<v Speaker 7>I mean Michael Jordan in his prime </v>
<v Speaker 7>goddamn tornado sweeping white women </v>

3108
02:15:23.851 --> 02:15:26.100
<v Speaker 7>through the air like semis.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Could you see that?</v>

3109
02:15:26.101 --> 02:15:31.101
<v Speaker 7>A video footage of Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the fucking tornado hitting Dallas and </v>

3110
02:15:31.101 --> 02:15:34.580
<v Speaker 7>semis were flying through the air like </v>
<v Speaker 7>paper Dom 18 wheelers full 18.</v>

3111
02:15:34.741 --> 02:15:36.120
<v Speaker 7>We're lose 30,</v>
<v Speaker 7>40,</v>

3112
02:15:36.121 --> 02:15:38.070
<v Speaker 7>50 feet in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just spinning in circles.</v>

3113
02:15:38.070 --> 02:15:39.960
<v Speaker 7>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>

3114
02:15:40.370 --> 02:15:42.420
<v Speaker 7>It's really weird to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

3115
02:15:42.510 --> 02:15:43.740
<v Speaker 7>I would highly recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

3116
02:15:43.790 --> 02:15:48.790
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is something that I'm personally </v>

3117
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:50.541
<v Speaker 7>going to start doing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is to take your fucking computer and </v>

3118
02:15:50.541 --> 02:15:51.300
<v Speaker 7>empty it all out onto external hard </v>
<v Speaker 7>drives.</v>

3119
02:15:51.301 --> 02:15:56.301
<v Speaker 7>And then unplug those external hard </v>
<v Speaker 7>drives from your computer and only use </v>

3120
02:15:56.301 --> 02:15:57.860
<v Speaker 7>them when you need to or make him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3121
02:15:58.220 --> 02:16:02.100
<v Speaker 7>but I mean it only takes it like if,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if people are hacking Max and people are</v>

3122
02:16:02.130 --> 02:16:06.210
<v Speaker 7>doing this shit now they feel like wiki </v>
<v Speaker 7>leaks and all this fucking crazy shit.</v>

3123
02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:08.700
<v Speaker 7>If you really want to fucking protect </v>
<v Speaker 7>these woody,</v>

3124
02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:13.720
<v Speaker 7>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well I mean I think hackers are way </v>

3125
02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:16.180
<v Speaker 7>above what we know that they are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3126
02:16:16.350 --> 02:16:21.350
<v Speaker 7>I think people are downloading fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>large amounts of information about </v>

3127
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:25.100
<v Speaker 7>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think there's fucking message boards </v>

3128
02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:25.100
<v Speaker 7>that people probably go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all right,</v>

3129

<v Speaker 3>building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the most incredible security spying</v>

3134
02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:43.620
<v Speaker 3>computer system ever where they're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be able to literally keep a data </v>

3135
02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:46.150
<v Speaker 3>record of every phone call you make </v>
<v Speaker 3>every text you send,</v>

3136
02:16:46.151 --> 02:16:49.160
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every phone call to get out.</v>

3137
02:16:50.350 --> 02:16:55.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you just stop and imagine that </v>

3138
02:16:55.350 --> 02:16:55.350
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3139
02:16:55.350 --> 02:16:58.040
<v Speaker 3>the ability to record every single phone</v>
<v Speaker 3>call that gets made throughout the </v>

3140
02:16:58.040 --> 02:16:59.770
<v Speaker 3>entire country all the time.</v>

3141
02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:04.800
<v Speaker 3>when the Dell is a dell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a big computer somewhere that </v>

3142
02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:07.180
<v Speaker 3>has all these information on it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

3143
02:17:07.230 --> 02:17:09.520
<v Speaker 3>And then finally it gets thrown out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everything we did,</v>

3144
02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:12.370
<v Speaker 3>everything we did on the computer is </v>
<v Speaker 3>stored somewhere.</v>
