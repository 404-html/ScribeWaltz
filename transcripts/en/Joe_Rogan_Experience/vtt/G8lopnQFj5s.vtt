1
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.320
<v Speaker 1>We all know there's treatment,</v>

3
00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>different treatment,</v>

4
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Celebrities,</v>

6
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.271
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7
00:00:07.271 --> 00:00:08.620
<v Speaker 1>especially in Scientology,</v>

8
00:00:08.621 --> 00:00:09.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:10.340
<v Speaker 1>it's highlighted.</v>

11
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.120
<v Speaker 1>It is like nothing you could ever imagine.</v>

12
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.050
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

13
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.250
<v Speaker 1>So when people say Tom doesn't leave because they have information on him or</v>

14
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:19.521
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

15
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:20.354
<v Speaker 1>that's not the reason.</v>

16
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.960
<v Speaker 1>The amount of power they receive from this church is like nothing in Hollywood.</v>

17
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.490
<v Speaker 1>It is like nothing.</v>

18
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.240
<v Speaker 1>There is no reason for them to leave this environment.</v>

19
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.661
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

20
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:34.820
<v Speaker 1>So it's super beneficial for them to be attached to it.</v>

21
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.683
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

22
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:36.860
<v Speaker 1>He has employees,</v>

23
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:37.850
<v Speaker 1>they work for him.</v>

24
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.950
<v Speaker 1>All these people will take care of his every need.</v>

25
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.051
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

26
00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:44.950
<v Speaker 1>And there's a policy on how to talk to somebody.</v>

27
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Like you wouldn't say,</v>

28
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm like if you said go get me a go get me a coffee and I wanted this</v>

29
00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:52.480
<v Speaker 1>temperature,</v>

30
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.621
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

31
00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:54.431
<v Speaker 1>I can't get it.</v>

32
00:00:54.431 --> 00:00:55.780
<v Speaker 1>We're five miles from any,</v>

33
00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:55.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:00:55.991 --> 00:00:58.540
<v Speaker 1>with 30 there'll be none of that kind of talk.</v>

35
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Like not any con there's policy about don't you don't talk back like ever.</v>

36
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 1>You don't step out of line.</v>

37
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:06.490
<v Speaker 1>You don't give an opinion.</v>

38
00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:07.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't make a face.</v>

39
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.800
<v Speaker 1>You don't make a gesture.</v>

40
00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:13.801
<v Speaker 1>You don't sigh if you step out of line in any way you are dealt with by the</v>

41
00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Church essentially has servants.</v>

42
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.293
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

43
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.553
<v Speaker 1>How many people?</v>

44
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.993
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

45
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.930
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

46
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.231
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

47
00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:23.681
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

48
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't begrudge somebody would have staff like if you can have it,</v>

49
00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:27.220
<v Speaker 1>I go do it all day,</v>

50
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:27.850
<v Speaker 1>all night,</v>

51
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.810
<v Speaker 1>do it all day,</v>

52
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:29.644
<v Speaker 1>all night.</v>

53
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.800
<v Speaker 1>But when you believe as a scientologist,</v>

54
00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:37.801
<v Speaker 1>you are working for somebody who single handedly is saving the planet and you</v>

55
00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:41.650
<v Speaker 1>deserve that kind of punishment.</v>

56
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.310
<v Speaker 1>That's something different,</v>

57
00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:43.541
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

58
00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 1>You understand what I'm like that,</v>

59
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.760
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

60
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.480
<v Speaker 1>it's an abuse that is not justified,</v>

61
00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:54.481
<v Speaker 1>but it is justified because you believe that you are single handedly saving the</v>

62
00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:56.344
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

63
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

64
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Capeesh yeah,</v>

65
00:01:58.741 --> 00:01:58.921
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

66
00:01:58.921 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

67
00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

68
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

69
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.373
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

70
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>so he's the main figurehead,</v>

71
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.381
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

72
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

73
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 1>He's the main guy like right up with Miscavige.</v>

74
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

75
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>And then John Travolta is somewhere in that,</v>

76
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.230
<v Speaker 1>I think John was given what a,</v>

77
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.073
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

78
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>a designation called [inaudible] where [inaudible] not,</v>

79
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.960
<v Speaker 1>can't con con.</v>

80
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

81
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 1>K.</v>

<v Speaker 1>H.</v>

83
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

84
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 1>K.</v>

85
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 1>H.</v>

86
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

87
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 1>N.</v>

88
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Gacaca.</v>

89
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

90
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

91
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.750
<v Speaker 1>He's given this designation of cocoon,</v>

92
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.860
<v Speaker 1>which there's a policy that basically says you can kill another human being.</v>

93
00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Speaker 1>If you were conned,</v>

94
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.350
<v Speaker 1>you're going to look the other way.</v>

95
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.190
<v Speaker 1>It was given that he was given that my l Ron Hubbard don't make me laugh cause</v>

96
00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>you gonna make me please don't make me repeat.</v>

97
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Don't let you out.</v>

98
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you work on a car all those years.</v>

99
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.453
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

100
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.300
<v Speaker 1>not very well.</v>

101
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any takes I ruined because of guys like Kevin Goes,</v>

102
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:50.950
<v Speaker 1>don't don't ruin this take.</v>

103
00:02:50.951 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

104
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.370
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

105
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.330
<v Speaker 1>don't tell him you're going to do with that.</v>

106
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.290
<v Speaker 1>And then I would ruin it.</v>

107
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.280
<v Speaker 1>I would ruin a gel because he hit me.</v>

108
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 1>He would do some stupid shit with his hands or something that he never rehearsed</v>

109
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>that would make me cry from laughter.</v>

110
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

111
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>And he was really highly inappropriate and moments that made me Pete almost fee.</v>

112
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

113
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

114
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

115
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>So he's a lot of kill people.</v>

116
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

117
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Just one or are you getting,</v>

118
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.181
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

119
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

120
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I should look at the policy again.</v>

121
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to us,</v>

122
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>we get it.</v>

123
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>But you're supposed to look the other way.</v>

124
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:20.370
<v Speaker 1>So like if somebody said something wrong to John Travolta Needs Polo,</v>

125
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Samurai sword and cut their head off,</v>

126
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 1>you just got to clean up the body clean up called ethics protection.</v>

127
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.011
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

128
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

129
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

130
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>So everyone would be responsible for dealing with it,</v>

131
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.473
<v Speaker 1>dealing with it.</v>

132
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Don't just leave the room.</v>

133
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>And he would know that you guys would take care of it.</v>

134
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.421
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

135
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>And there's also another policy.</v>

136
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:36.281
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

137
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:36.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

138
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I say these policies is because I don't like when people say,</v>

139
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:40.571
<v Speaker 1>Leah,</v>

140
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:41.321
<v Speaker 1>I believe you.</v>

141
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to believe me.</v>

142
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>I want you to look it up.</v>

143
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

144
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 1>I want you to look for yourself and make your own decisions.</v>

145
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 1>So I keep quoting these policies because I want people to look it up so that</v>

146
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>they can say,</v>

147
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>that's shit's true.</v>

148
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:52.870
