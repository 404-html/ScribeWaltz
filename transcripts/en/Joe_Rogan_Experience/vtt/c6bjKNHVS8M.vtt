5
00:00:10.731 --> 00:00:15.600

<v Speaker 1>money came into fake fucking money and</v>

6
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:19.220

<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers that you needed it because</v>

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.270

<v Speaker 1>to find those people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

10

<v Speaker 1>Funny.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We're echoing garland.</v>

15
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Gunderson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gunderson.</v>

16
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's down south.</v>

17
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.410
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about all that shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the Denver airport?</v>

18
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Do you know anything about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy behind the Denver airport is</v>

19
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.790
<v Speaker 1>the Denver airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

20
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:50.820
<v Speaker 1>they moved away more dirt than it needed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to and so there's this.</v>

21
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 1>All this thought that there's some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of subterranean tunnel tunnel system and</v>

22
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:57.480
<v Speaker 1>it's all based on the end of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shelters.</v>

23
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.910
<v Speaker 1>They fucked up Stapleton airport was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>

24
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burbank.</v>

25
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>You could smuggle a fucking dead fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>kilos of coke and nobody said nothing</v>

26
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden they came up with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bright idea.</v>

27
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Let's fucking make an airport 90 miles</v>
<v Speaker 1>farther out by Kansas.</v>

28
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Someone it snows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really get fucking buried.</v>

29
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.090
<v Speaker 1>We have no protection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bunch of cowboys role making</v>

30
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>decisions and trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're too stupid to even know the</v>

31
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:25.100
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory is that people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>built it maybe.</v>

32
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>But if the government was really truly</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind it,</v>

33
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>like all these people think what it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they made an airport there.</v>

34
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>But in constructing the airport they</v>
<v Speaker 1>also built some sort of underground</v>

35
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>safeguard three stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's gotta be some Kinky Shit.</v>

36
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's close,</v>

37
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean that would be a move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

38
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Nora in airport and then build some</v>
<v Speaker 1>shelters.</v>

39
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.290
<v Speaker 1>That airport is like fucking Kansas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kansas during dick out there.</v>

40
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.130
<v Speaker 1>That's what they call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>

41
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.130
<v Speaker 1>If it was easy man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I lived in Denver or in Boulder,</v>

42
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>there was easy to drive there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drive fucking hour.</v>

43
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never any traffic to be 25 minutes.</v>

44
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

45
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.480
<v Speaker 1>There's no traffic on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't matter.</v>

46
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Used to be 25 minutes with no traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tunes crack the window a bit.</v>

47
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>They built this monster to spend money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They built this bond,</v>

48
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>this monster to to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just,</v>

49
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I went to fucking newark to</v>

50
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>see the fights with you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did it.</v>

51
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.210
<v Speaker 1>They built the soccer stadium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soccer stadium in Newark.</v>

52
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.970
<v Speaker 1>That's spending money left and right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they still can't put it on the left</v>

53
00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>hand turning signal.</v>

54
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>So if you got to make a left 29 fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles and people trying to keep up the</v>

55
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:31.560
<v Speaker 1>reputation as the car jack capital of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and if you've got some left</v>

56
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 1>turn signals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get some outlet.</v>

57
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>People can escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can escape the drama.</v>

58
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about that.</v>

59
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:39.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>they think that there's something really</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on inside that Denver airport.</v>

61
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:46.290
<v Speaker 1>There's all these documentaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dedicated to it and one of the</v>

62
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:51.291
<v Speaker 1>reasons for it is because there's these</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy murals that were painted up in the</v>

63
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Denver airport and they're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing man.</v>

64
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Their apocalyptic like one guy's gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking gas mask on with a giant and</v>

65
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 2>there's pictures of children and coffins</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's fire in the background.</v>

66
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:05.070
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

67
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've actually talked about on this</v>

68
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 2>podcast before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you think that has anything to do</v>

69
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that?</v>

70
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 2>I think putting the two together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that it does definitely,</v>

71
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have opinion one way or another.</v>

73
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:23.161
<v Speaker 2>I've listened to the people talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it's some great escape base in 2012</v>

74
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:27.210
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be fucking asteroid's</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna hit that.</v>

75
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.290

<v Speaker 2>It's going to kill everybody except the</v>

76
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 2>people that are in this underground</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunker.</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking nuclear bomb.</v>

<v Speaker 1>dog.</v>

258
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.060

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.580
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of food over there and</v>

261
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.030
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it a fucking</v>

262
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.720
<v Speaker 2>coincidence that for whatever reason we</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide to attack Libya instead of going</v>

263
00:11:58.721 --> 00:12:02.800
<v Speaker 2>to Mexico and straighten out that</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit that's right next door,</v>

264
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.390

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Burritos and hookers and donkeys and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tequila because there's not a lot of</v>

266
00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:10.220
<v Speaker 2>shit to offer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans getting ready though.</v>

267
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.540
<v Speaker 2>But listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's some crazy motherfuckers known</v>

268
00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:14.230
<v Speaker 2>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got to dig in to clean up their</v>

269
00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:15.760
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got a big problem and it's</v>

270
00:12:15.761 --> 00:12:17.500
<v Speaker 2>because of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big part of it.</v>

271
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.790
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to make everything legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to,</v>

272
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>

273
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a little known fact.</v>

274
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 2>Mexico is decriminalized everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Small amounts.</v>

275
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 2>We're not selling it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's legal now.</v>

276
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:31.450
<v Speaker 2>You could get acid in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get mushrooms in Mexico.</v>

277
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.900
<v Speaker 2>They decriminalized everything just</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they had to allocate resources</v>

278
00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:36.940
<v Speaker 2>to fight these fucking drug lords.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

279
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:39.130
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a country that country's gone.</v>

283
00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:48.130

<v Speaker 2>lives in your country.</v>

284
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like if we were fighting al Qaeda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but al Qaeda had billions of dollars and</v>

285
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:54.340

<v Speaker 2>He's got a high fence I've always</v>

299
00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:28.330
<v Speaker 2>admired with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a retard,</v>

300
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.750
<v Speaker 2>but I think he does a lot of things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really agree with and one of the</v>

301
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:33.790
<v Speaker 2>things that I agree with is when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived in Michigan,</v>

302
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:36.790
<v Speaker 2>he had this bad ass compound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll have 2000 acres or something like</v>

303
00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:41.740
<v Speaker 2>that and it was all fenced in and had</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these animals living inside his</v>

304
00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:43.480
<v Speaker 2>compound and he would just go and Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

305
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.040
<v Speaker 2>and that's where he got all his food</v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

306
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.370
<v Speaker 2>He got all his food from hunting on his</v>
<v Speaker 2>own property and I'm like,</v>

307
00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:49.840
<v Speaker 2>God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking brilliant.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I would love to live like that.</v>

309
00:13:51.791 --> 00:13:54.940

310
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.070
<v Speaker 2>moving to Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why I was up there,</v>

311
00:13:57.071 --> 00:13:57.731
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to live somewhere with this.</v>

344
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.520
<v Speaker 2>If this place falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the humans here.</v>

345
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.730

<v Speaker 2>We keep on saying that,</v>

346
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:29.600
<v Speaker 2>but we're not doing anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did I fucking moved man?</v>

347
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.570
<v Speaker 2>The only reason why I came back is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Mrs Reagan got pregnant and</v>

348
00:15:32.571 --> 00:15:35.870
<v Speaker 2>because the dog had eaten by mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might have went to the suburbs.</v>

349
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Then my next move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're actually talking about it.</v>

350
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I'm already talking to</v>
<v Speaker 2>real estate agents.</v>

352
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:51.020
<v Speaker 2>All that nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The move to move is you'd go and you'd</v>

353
00:15:51.021 --> 00:15:53.560
<v Speaker 2>get a summer place and you try it out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and lived there for a summer.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It sounds like you'd be super nice while</v>

355
00:15:55.461 --> 00:15:57.510

<v Speaker 2>so it becomes on the side.</v>

356
00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.290
<v Speaker 2>Just every time we were there I'll just</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring home flowers and shit and then we</v>

357
00:16:01.291 --> 00:16:05.210

<v Speaker 2>they're not like that for just</v>

545
00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.390
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

546
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that must be a strange,</v>

547
00:23:52.281 --> 00:23:56.150
<v Speaker 2>strange existence where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of being dumb is that you're</v>

548
00:23:56.151 --> 00:23:57.980
<v Speaker 2>too dumb to realize you're dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

549
00:23:57.981 --> 00:23:59.330
<v Speaker 2>And if he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying dumb,</v>

550
00:23:59.331 --> 00:24:01.580
<v Speaker 2>like there's like they're lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have an issue,</v>

551
00:24:01.581 --> 00:24:04.130
<v Speaker 2>there's a mental issues and the mental</v>
<v Speaker 2>imbalance or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

552
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.110
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're impaired,</v>

553
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.180
<v Speaker 2>but there so impaired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know they're impaired.</v>

554
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:10.580
<v Speaker 2>Like they've lost the ability to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're impaired.</v>

555
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a strange thing.</v>

556
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.520
<v Speaker 5>What if they all have an inner voice</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that's completely normal,</v>

557
00:24:15.521 --> 00:24:18.050
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they can't take a to be like,</v>

558
00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:18.893
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

559
00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:22.500
<v Speaker 5>So the whole time that was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe how much they treat me</v>

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.580
<v Speaker 5>so horrible and I wish I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

561
00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.130
<v Speaker 5>but they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they try to say it,</v>

562
00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:27.620
<v Speaker 5>it's like theater.</v>

563
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.930
<v Speaker 2>There's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably a lot of that.</v>

564
00:24:30.931 --> 00:24:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a bunch of different</v>

565
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.300
<v Speaker 2>types of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's not just simple as.</v>

569
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>

570
00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.780

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

571
00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:44.610

<v Speaker 2>our minds are impaired in comparison.</v>

576
00:24:52.201 --> 00:24:57.201
<v Speaker 2>I was watching this fucking 12 year old</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid is autistic kid with 170 Iq doing</v>

577
00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:01.170
<v Speaker 2>his take on the theory of relativity and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's writing out equations on this</v>

578
00:25:01.171 --> 00:25:03.030
<v Speaker 2>fucking window and I'm watching this</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

579
00:25:03.031 --> 00:25:05.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kid might as well be a fucking</v>

580
00:25:05.401 --> 00:25:06.570
<v Speaker 2>alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

581
00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

582
00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.190
<v Speaker 2>He's explaining this like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all simple simple shit.</v>

583
00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:15.030
<v Speaker 2>When this is so far beyond my capacity</v>
<v Speaker 2>to him,</v>

584
00:25:15.031 --> 00:25:16.890
<v Speaker 2>to this autistic kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm retarded.</v>

585
00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:20.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am this guy who he has to humor</v>

586
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.140
<v Speaker 2>because I can't understand a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>word,</v>

587
00:25:22.141 --> 00:25:24.690
<v Speaker 2>a letter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a singular part of his equation.</v>

588
00:25:24.691 --> 00:25:27.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's going on up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's chaos to me,</v>

589
00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.670
<v Speaker 2>but to him it's so clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a language.</v>

590
00:25:29.671 --> 00:25:30.061
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

591
00:25:30.061 --> 00:25:33.270
<v Speaker 2>quite simply you have to move this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this becomes x equals y equals two.</v>

592
00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.750
<v Speaker 2>We are the retards to that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>people with down syndrome.</v>

595
00:25:40.141 --> 00:25:42.120

<v Speaker 2>down syndrome.</v>

596
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's just like us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We feel bad with people who have autism,</v>

597
00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:49.170
<v Speaker 2>like poor kid's got autism and he can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>engage in all the normal emotional</v>

598
00:25:49.171 --> 00:25:51.100
<v Speaker 2>things that we do.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't see through walls.</v>

605

<v Speaker 1>Like looking at the wind blowing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>flag and going,</v>

687
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:31.710
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

688
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.830
<v Speaker 1>That flag is the answer to all my</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking problem.</v>

689
00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:38.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the answer right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even at that age I knew my mother</v>

690
00:29:38.371 --> 00:29:40.080
<v Speaker 1>was fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I do.</v>

691
00:29:40.081 --> 00:29:44.530
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't a full flight American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you look at that flag and you</v>

692
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:47.530
<v Speaker 1>just come here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a scene in the beginning of</v>

693
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:50.640
<v Speaker 1>scarface when they're on the boat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they finally see land and they showed</v>

694
00:29:50.641 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 1>the American flag and the director,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever the guy is brilliant enough to</v>

695
00:29:54.191 --> 00:29:56.320
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He showed it from a different angle.</v>

696
00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:59.500
<v Speaker 1>What that flag looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just we overlooked that flag</v>

697
00:29:59.501 --> 00:30:02.110
<v Speaker 1>every fucking day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We overlooked that flag.</v>

698
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.170
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what it is to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that flag when you first come in and to</v>

699
00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:08.200
<v Speaker 1>know that that's your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your magic carpet.</v>

700
00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:11.320
<v Speaker 1>It's the highest ideal in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the highest ideal.</v>

701
00:30:11.321 --> 00:30:14.770
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so infuriating when</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians are fucking corrupt.</v>

702
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.820
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

703
00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:18.100
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you criticize what America does</v>

704
00:30:18.101 --> 00:30:19.480
<v Speaker 1>overseas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you love America?</v>

705
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you love it,</v>

706
00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:22.720
<v Speaker 1>you want to tell the fucking truth about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's doing.</v>

707
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:23.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you love it,</v>

708
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:26.020
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to stand up and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

709
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't love it by letting</v>
<v Speaker 1>it get away with stupid shit because</v>

710
00:30:30.011 --> 00:30:32.650
<v Speaker 1>there's some corrupt concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wheel that's not.</v>

711
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.690
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you don't love the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of America.</v>

712
00:30:34.691 --> 00:30:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love the idea of America for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

713
00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I always remember we only see the one</v>
<v Speaker 1>side of that flag.</v>

714
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.950
<v Speaker 1>We never see both sides together</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen,</v>

715
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.550
<v Speaker 1>and that's a point we never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We only see that one side of the flag</v>

716
00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.250
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've discussed that the CIA is setting</v>

717
00:30:48.251 --> 00:30:51.270
<v Speaker 1>up things in Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they setting up this starting a</v>

718
00:30:51.271 --> 00:30:52.420
<v Speaker 1>war that started in business.</v>

719
00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.780
<v Speaker 1>They're getting things going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other side of that flag that</v>

720
00:30:55.781 --> 00:30:58.690
<v Speaker 1>will never able to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We only see once you put a mirror on the</v>

721
00:30:58.691 --> 00:31:00.220
<v Speaker 1>other side of the flag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

722
00:31:00.221 --> 00:31:03.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the one side of the flag that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have since we accept this side of the</v>

723
00:31:03.401 --> 00:31:05.080
<v Speaker 1>flag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to accept that.</v>

724
00:31:05.081 --> 00:31:09.310
<v Speaker 1>So the only way that side this side is</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible where it's easy to drive around</v>

725
00:31:09.311 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 1>is if they're doing all this creepy shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta bring.</v>

726
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Unless we bring the whole world together</v>
<v Speaker 1>in on everything and that's just not</v>

727
00:31:15.251 --> 00:31:17.440
<v Speaker 1>going to happen and we've done fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

728
00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Do Creepy Shit to trust them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't trust people to be cool.</v>

729
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.310
<v Speaker 1>You know the look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural instinct,</v>

730
00:31:24.311 --> 00:31:27.430
<v Speaker 1>if someone can get into a position of</v>
<v Speaker 1>power is to be Kadafi.</v>

731
00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the natural instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The natural instinct is to get botox.</v>

732
00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.220
<v Speaker 1>When you're 80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this big stupid liquid rubber</v>

733
00:31:33.221 --> 00:31:36.760
<v Speaker 1>face were goofy clothes and just be</v>
<v Speaker 1>running shit.</v>

734
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Even though you're this old con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

735
00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:42.250
<v Speaker 1>living in some fucking castle with</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars doing that job,</v>

736
00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.880
<v Speaker 1>can you tell me why is he going with me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We put billions of dollars from money.</v>

737
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.730
<v Speaker 1>That inside of that flag is money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan.</v>

738
00:31:48.731 --> 00:31:50.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never had comprehend that.</v>

739
00:31:50.951 --> 00:31:53.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the reality of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stand up is a beautiful thing to do.</v>

740
00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Some guys are brilliant and some guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't millionaires.</v>

741
00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.530
<v Speaker 1>The other fall between the crack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other side of the standup up,</v>

742
00:31:59.531 --> 00:32:02.470
<v Speaker 1>it's a business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is a fucking business guys and</v>

743
00:32:02.471 --> 00:32:04.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other side of that flag is a</v>

744
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:07.990
<v Speaker 1>business guys and the same way we want</v>
<v Speaker 1>social security.</v>

745
00:32:07.991 --> 00:32:10.790
<v Speaker 1>One was 65.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A country as a dual sell a couple of</v>

746
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.810
<v Speaker 1>kilos every once in a while to replenish</v>
<v Speaker 1>those fucking funds.</v>

747
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.570
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's aside of the American public.</v>

748
00:32:16.571 --> 00:32:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to know that society that</v>
<v Speaker 1>included Kennedy.</v>

749
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:22.090
<v Speaker 1>That's aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Alex Jones talks about whether it's</v>

750
00:32:22.091 --> 00:32:24.400
<v Speaker 1>true or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's society we not supposed to see</v>

751
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.980
<v Speaker 1>was supposed to be focused on the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>side on what that machine is supposed to</v>

752
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:32.620
<v Speaker 1>mean to us and for guys like you and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>like looking behind the curtain,</v>

753
00:32:32.621 --> 00:32:35.650
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't because I grew up in a in a</v>

754
00:32:35.651 --> 00:32:39.190
<v Speaker 1>corrupt hometown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seen what politics is at a minute</v>

755
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.190
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even dream of what it is at a</v>

756
00:32:41.191 --> 00:32:45.500
<v Speaker 1>national level when I'm taking political</v>
<v Speaker 1>contributions,</v>

757
00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:48.500
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to pass your fucking bills</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you could pass that law.</v>

758
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:51.890
<v Speaker 1>That'll make people's hands grow back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also going to give them</v>

759
00:32:51.891 --> 00:32:54.050
<v Speaker 1>cancer in the eyeballs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it.</v>

760
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.300
<v Speaker 1>It grows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If when I grew up in it,</v>

761
00:32:56.301 --> 00:33:00.530
<v Speaker 1>when it was in the micro process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I now it's in the national level of</v>

762
00:33:00.531 --> 00:33:05.000
<v Speaker 1>corruption isn't a macro process and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts with little things and townships</v>

763
00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.130
<v Speaker 1>where if it's a macro smaller than my</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro macro,</v>

764
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.380
<v Speaker 1>a little high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry guys,</v>

765
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.780
<v Speaker 1>but you understand my know exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying.</v>

766
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.110
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corruption if not checked,</v>

767
00:33:15.111 --> 00:33:16.910
<v Speaker 1>grows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all just keeps getting bigger.</v>

768
00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:17.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

769
00:33:17.901 --> 00:33:20.480
<v Speaker 1>we got to cut the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we've been making millions of</v>

770
00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.790
<v Speaker 1>dollars on the sneak tip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody's to stop right now and</v>

771
00:33:22.791 --> 00:33:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

772
00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Why are you still making money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These wiki leak things are pretty cool</v>

773
00:33:27.101 --> 00:33:28.980
<v Speaker 2>for the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in general,</v>

774
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:30.940
<v Speaker 2>that's why these assholes want to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy in jail.</v>

775
00:33:30.941 --> 00:33:32.590
<v Speaker 2>They want to say it compromises</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans can.</v>

776
00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:33.401
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

777
00:33:33.401 --> 00:33:35.440
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did exactly what the New York Times</v>

778
00:33:35.441 --> 00:33:37.210
<v Speaker 2>was supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they got that information,</v>

779
00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.890
<v Speaker 5>they should have done that on twitter</v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

780
00:33:38.891 --> 00:33:41.230
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine if there was just like</v>
<v Speaker 5>this twitter address that everyone</v>

781
00:33:41.231 --> 00:33:43.300
<v Speaker 5>followed that every tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>twitter,</v>

782
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.440
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>JFK,</v>

785
00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:52.360
<v Speaker 5>they really shouldn't have twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They released some,</v>

786
00:33:52.361 --> 00:33:53.220
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an artist article</v>

787
00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:57.180
<v Speaker 2>about how um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different parts of the American economy</v>

788
00:33:57.181 --> 00:34:00.570
<v Speaker 2>are influenced by genetically modified</v>
<v Speaker 2>foods and how we're trying to force them</v>

789
00:34:00.571 --> 00:34:03.000
<v Speaker 2>on other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were like fucking with other</v>

790
00:34:03.001 --> 00:34:04.890
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they don't go into the genetically</v>

791
00:34:04.891 --> 00:34:07.330
<v Speaker 2>modified food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they don't start growing like</v>

792
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Monsanto corn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit like that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

795
00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:13.500
<v Speaker 2>these giant companies are way too</v>
<v Speaker 2>embedded into the political system.</v>

796
00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:16.410
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing stuff for the greater</v>
<v Speaker 2>good of people there doing stuff for the</v>

797
00:34:16.411 --> 00:34:19.830
<v Speaker 2>profitability of giant corporations that</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved them into position in the first</v>

798
00:34:19.831 --> 00:34:21.720
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

<v Speaker 2>to make a bonus.</v>

872
00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.940
<v Speaker 2>If the bank does well,</v>

00:37:48.941 --> 00:37:51.520
<v Speaker 2>personal responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when the bank fucking fails,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Mexico that's happening right now in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger,</v>

1080
00:47:03.791 --> 00:47:05.380
<v Speaker 2>even bigger scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1081
00:47:05.381 --> 00:47:07.510
<v Speaker 2>because the Colombians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they had like they were</v>

1082
00:47:07.511 --> 00:47:10.270
<v Speaker 2>selling drugs and they were bringing</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs and they weren't getting that much</v>

1083
00:47:10.271 --> 00:47:12.620
<v Speaker 2>resistance from their government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Mexico,</v>

1087
00:47:18.341 --> 00:47:20.430
<v Speaker 2>they get a lot of resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>
