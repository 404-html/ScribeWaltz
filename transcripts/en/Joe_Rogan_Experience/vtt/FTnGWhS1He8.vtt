00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we chipping away at this thing,</v>

2
00:00:05.531 --> 00:00:08.230
<v Speaker 1>like we know that politicians are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>an act.</v>

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.880
<v Speaker 1>We know that there when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I've always mocked the way they</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate,</v>

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.690
<v Speaker 1>like the way that give speeches with</v>
<v Speaker 1>long pauses and this very distinct</v>

6
00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:20.500
<v Speaker 1>pattern of behavior that's completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>alien to anything other than a political</v>

7
00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:23.590
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the only way this country survives,</v>

8
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that kind of the strange thing that</v>

9
00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:27.360
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when,</v>

10
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.860
<v Speaker 1>when we're always like chipping away at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were always trying to like,</v>

11
00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:31.930
<v Speaker 1>get to like be real key,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get look,</v>

12
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.210
<v Speaker 1>we gotta get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gotta find out what's real and then</v>

13
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.450
<v Speaker 1>we get this guy who realer than anyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever been.</v>

14
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And it scares us.</v>

17
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 1>That's the point of that documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like to be lied to.</v>

18
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Wwe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes us all feel calm and</v>

19
00:00:46.751 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 1>comfortable to be given a stable live</v>
<v Speaker 1>than to be showing the real truth of how</v>

20
00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:52.870

<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's so scary.</v>

24
00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:00.184
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to butcher the details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

58
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:12.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>

61
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they were flying,</v>

64
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:29.880
<v Speaker 1>they're doing a routine flight or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and they had to crash land in</v>

65
00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>the ocean and it was getting night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

66
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>I believed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believed the pilot died and I could be</v>

67
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>wrong on that.</v>

68
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.580
<v Speaker 1>The pilot died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his other guy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and they got split up cause it was</v>

72
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>getting dark at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

73
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>And so then now they're swimming alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And anyone who knows,</v>

74
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.910
<v Speaker 1>you know San Francisco is cold room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

75
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jazz water dump.</v>

76
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:00.731
<v Speaker 1>Dump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dump,</v>

77
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:01.151
<v Speaker 1>dump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dump,</v>

78
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:01.571
<v Speaker 1>dump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dump.</v>

79
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:02.840
<v Speaker 1>That's where they breed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

80

<v Speaker 1>Early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

81
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whites breed in northern California.</v>

82
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.070
<v Speaker 1>There's like a nesting ground up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Fuck on now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you want to crash a plane?</v>

84
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>They're not where you want to swim from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alcatraz five times either in your</v>

85
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

86
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:14.741
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I've heard of that race.</v>

88
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 1>They know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's crazy.</v>

89
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:18.724
<v Speaker 1>You've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your dad had a swim two miles.</v>

91
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like that made more.</v>

92
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>I could have been more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd fuck,</v>

93
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>but it was a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going for a couple hundred yards.</v>

94
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I started looking for a log to hang</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto.</v>

95
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>And what is the difference in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>results from someone who does that?</v>

96
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Because I know quite a few people who've</v>
<v Speaker 1>done it that way.</v>

97
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>They've had injuries treated where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>suck the fat out are</v>

98
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.750
<v Speaker 2>there isn't any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

99
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.190
<v Speaker 2>any research to differentiate like one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these treatments versus another yet</v>

100
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.170
<v Speaker 2>it's just not available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's all anecdotal.</v>

101
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.900
<v Speaker 2>It's terms of like talking to patients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's happening.</v>

102
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:54.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean people are collecting the data</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just not,</v>

103
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not at the mature stage where,</v>

104
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

105
00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:01.610
<v Speaker 2>where it's available and we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.760
<v Speaker 2>published stuff to look at and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and personally know of anybody who's had</v>

107
00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:07.620
<v Speaker 2>really good results using the fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>method.</v>

108
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

109
00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:10.560
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

110
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.220
<v Speaker 2>a physician friend of mine in Memphis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tennessee,</v>

111
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.040
<v Speaker 2>her name's doctor Laura Lenderman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

112
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.070
<v Speaker 2>she has utilized that quite a bit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's been very happy with the patients</v>

113
00:04:22.531 --> 00:04:24.390
<v Speaker 2>that she's treated in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Naturally.</v>

114
00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Some people do better than others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

115
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real,</v>

116
00:04:28.621 --> 00:04:31.470
<v Speaker 2>the rigorous study of this though is</v>
<v Speaker 2>still yet to come.</v>

117
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.280
<v Speaker 2>That's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

118
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.410
<v Speaker 2>have you considered trying that or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just definitely,</v>

119
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

120
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.980
<v Speaker 2>But you don't so far you just do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stem cells haven't had anybody</v>

121
00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:45.420
<v Speaker 2>specifically request it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody wants to lose a little fat and</v>

122
00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:46.980
<v Speaker 2>fix her knees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

123
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably taking things in a</v>

124
00:04:49.171 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 2>direction I don't want to be going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by plastic surgery there are,</v>

125
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.910
<v Speaker 2>we know there are a number of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>options in terms of where these sources</v>

126
00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:01.320
<v Speaker 2>of the cells can come from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

127
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.360
<v Speaker 2>bone marrow is certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

128
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.480
<v Speaker 2>had a lot of use and Daniel Needs da had</v>
<v Speaker 2>that done.</v>

129
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.650
<v Speaker 2>That's what he told me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

130
00:05:07.651 --> 00:05:10.770
<v Speaker 2>He had a pulled out of his hip and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>said it was brutally painful then he was</v>

131
00:05:10.771 --> 00:05:13.210
<v Speaker 2>walking with a limp for like two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

132
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.800
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's a procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

133
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.400
<v Speaker 2>there's pain and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

134
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:19.320
<v Speaker 2>morbidity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a consequence to,</v>

135
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting a sharp object into the bone and</v>

136
00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 2>drawing that bone marrow.</v>

137
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.553
<v Speaker 2>So it means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

138
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.770
<v Speaker 2>a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that word now.</v>

139
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.770
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't like it either.</v>

140
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.960
<v Speaker 2>In medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more bid is,</v>

141
00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:34.260
<v Speaker 2>we have our word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have conferences called morbidity and</v>

142
00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:37.170
<v Speaker 2>mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where he basically own up to</v>

143
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:40.170
<v Speaker 2>things that you've done a terrible job</v>
<v Speaker 2>with or explain,</v>

144
00:05:40.171 --> 00:05:42.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why somebody has died as a result of</v>

145
00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:46.980
<v Speaker 2>your care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a awful thing to go through.</v>

146
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.870
<v Speaker 2>And it's critically important to be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to evaluate yourself and understand what</v>

147
00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:53.940
<v Speaker 2>things happen when they don't go the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we want them to.</v>

148
00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 2>So it's an important exercise that</v>
<v Speaker 2>physicians go through to,</v>

149
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>review cases.</v>

150
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 2>So I can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

151
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.011
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

152
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're dealing with people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are broken apart.</v>

153
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially as an orthopedic surgeon,</v>

154
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with people's bodies a</v>
<v Speaker 2>failed,</v>

155
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your limbs have failed,</v>

156
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 2>ligaments have torn off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bone and knees have exploded.</v>

157
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've told me some gnarly stuff in</v>

158
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 2>terms of the kind of injuries that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to treat,</v>

159
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 2>and I could only imagine some of bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

160
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

161
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
