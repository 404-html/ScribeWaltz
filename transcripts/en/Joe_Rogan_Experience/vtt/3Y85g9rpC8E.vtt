1
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay rogan</v>

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.920
<v Speaker 2>experience</v>

3
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.603
<v Speaker 2>paradise.</v>

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Why are you right now?</v>

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna I was gonna Watch the Bisping fight the Bisbing Kelvin guests limb</v>

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>fight live and uh,</v>

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>do like sort of a breakdown of it while it was happening.</v>

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>But the shit was going on at like two o'clock in the morning out here and</v>

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.203
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't happening.</v>

11
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.320
<v Speaker 3>I have been eating like a pig and drinking.</v>

12
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:42.880
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing vacation type shit.</v>

13
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm a strong believer in that you need to do vacation time.</v>

14
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.250
<v Speaker 3>Like vacation time is important.</v>

15
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.170
<v Speaker 3>You can't just be working all the time.</v>

16
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 3>Occasionally you have to just fuck off.</v>

17
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.360
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what I've been doing.</v>

18
00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.410
<v Speaker 3>I just been fucking off.</v>

19
00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:00.190
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

20
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.520
<v Speaker 3>I was tired and I decided I am not going to stay up late.</v>

21
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.410
<v Speaker 3>And so I watched it in the morning.</v>

22
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.260
<v Speaker 3>I watched it this morning and I've got a couple of thoughts on it.</v>

23
00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:10.130
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

24
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

25
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Brennan Chub said this on his Instagram and I could not agree more.</v>

26
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you should be allowed to fight three weeks after you have a brutal</v>

27
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:25.850
<v Speaker 3>fight like Michael Bisping did with GSP.</v>

28
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.230
<v Speaker 3>He got rocked,</v>

29
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.470
<v Speaker 3>he got choked unconscious and then three weeks later he's fighting a really</v>

30
00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:34.364
<v Speaker 3>dangerous,</v>

31
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

32
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 3>young and up and coming Kelvin gas alum and Calvin is a beast.</v>

33
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:43.140
<v Speaker 3>He's gotten nasty boxing and that is what he showed in that fight.</v>

34
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.470
<v Speaker 3>He hit him with a beautiful straight right jab and a right hand behind it and oh</v>

35
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:50.671
<v Speaker 3>my goodness.</v>

36
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:51.504
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>

37
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 3>that kid is just on fire.</v>

38
00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:53.591
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

39
00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 3>he's just on another level right now.</v>

40
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:56.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm super,</v>

41
00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 3>super impressed with Calvin.</v>

42
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Calvin has got lightening fast hands and he's,</v>

43
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.620
<v Speaker 1>he's an interesting guy because he's what I would call a tweener.</v>

44
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that I don't,</v>

45
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think Kelvin</v>

46
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.433
<v Speaker 4>in</v>

47
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 1>in the best,</v>

48
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>best of times,</v>

49
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:20.550
<v Speaker 1>like if Calvin has the best camp and the the best performance,</v>

50
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that he could beat anybody at 185 pounds.</v>

51
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.640
<v Speaker 1>But should he be at 185 pounds?</v>

52
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.751
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

53
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because Chris Weidman is that 185 pounds.</v>

54
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>And when Chris Weidman got Calvin to the ground,</v>

55
00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:36.690
<v Speaker 1>it really did look like you're talking about two completely different weight</v>

56
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:37.524
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

57
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 1>And Chris Weidman was able to show Calvin out.</v>

58
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:44.721
<v Speaker 1>And obviously Weidman is a former champion and there's absolutely no shame in</v>

59
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:46.290
<v Speaker 1>losing to Chris Weidman,</v>

60
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's just the way</v>

61
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>it looked when you were watching the fight.</v>

62
00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>To me it looked like two different weight classes.</v>

63
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.831
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

64
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:56.664
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

65
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that think that really Calvin should be fighting at 170</v>

66
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>pounds if he got the proper diet.</v>

67
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.430
<v Speaker 1>And he was doing that for a while.</v>

68
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

69
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>it was at one point in time,</v>

70
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

71
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.423
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.751
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

74
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>dolce was working with them for a while and,</v>

75
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:14.321
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>he had his diet in line and he looked fantastic and then,</v>

77
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>just things happen and he didn't want to pay the dolce money.</v>

79
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.431
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

80
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:25.264
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>I dunno who he's working with right now as a nutritionist,</v>

82
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>

83
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:31.174
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a phenomenal fighter.</v>

85
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know if 185 pounds is,</v>

86
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>is the right way class form.</v>

87
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.653
<v Speaker 1>It could be.</v>

88
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

89
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>it could be that maybe what he really needs to do is just lose some body fat,</v>

90
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 1>put on some muscle and maybe 185 pounds will be his weight class.</v>

91
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:54.811
<v Speaker 1>It's just that constant debate of whether or not you should weaken your body and</v>

92
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>dropped down to the minimum weight you can or whether or not you should fight at</v>

93
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>a natural way and have a healthy body.</v>

94
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.880
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

95
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a real good argument.</v>

96
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 1>And I'm pausing right now because I'm pulling something up.</v>

97
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.113
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

98
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>there's a girl that just died in Australia.</v>

99
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

100
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 1>she died</v>

101
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 1>very recently.</v>

102
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.453
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

103
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 1>she was preparing for a Moitai fight and it's just,</v>

104
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.520
<v Speaker 1>it's just part of what this sport is about.</v>

105
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>

106
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:31.450
<v Speaker 1>It did really bothers the fucking shit out of me.</v>

107
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the scariest thing.</v>

108
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

109
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.751
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

110
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:35.584
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

111
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.341
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

112
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:36.791
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

113
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Teenager dies training.</v>

114
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

115
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

116
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.350
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

117
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 1>the girl's name,</v>

118
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.590
<v Speaker 1>she was 18 years old and uh,</v>

119
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 1>her name was Jessica Lindsey and she died while she was cutting weight.</v>

120
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.630
<v Speaker 1>She was an amateur kickboxer and Australia.</v>

121
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.693
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

122
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 1>I cut weight a bunch of times when I was doing taekwondo tournaments and,</v>

123
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

124
00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>it is brutal.</v>

125
00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

126
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible.</v>

127
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.110
<v Speaker 1>I was bad at it too.</v>

128
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do it correctly.</v>

129
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>I just worked out real hard the night before and more rubber suits and the whole</v>

130
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>deal and dehydrated myself and I didn't rehydrate myself well either.</v>

131
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 1>So I felt like shit the next day when I was fighting.</v>

132
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.391
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

133
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:16.581
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

134
00:05:16.581 --> 00:05:19.660
<v Speaker 1>a lot of wrestlers back in the day used to do the same thing.</v>

135
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

136
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.650
<v Speaker 1>my weight cut though was nowhere near as extreme as some of the MMA fighters do.</v>

137
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Some MMA fighters.</v>

138
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:28.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

139
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.460
<v Speaker 1>they're getting on death's door and,</v>

140
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:31.294
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

141
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.313
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

142
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.980
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's a,</v>

143
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 1>one of the most disturbing and a most unfortunate aspects of MMA.</v>

144
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

145
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Lee said before his last fight with Tony Ferguson that,</v>

146
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:45.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>he felt like he was,</v>

148
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.430
<v Speaker 1>he was dying when he was cutting weight and he made the weight Habib number go</v>

149
00:05:50.431 --> 00:05:50.801
<v Speaker 1>Madoff,</v>

150
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:51.634
<v Speaker 1>who is the,</v>

151
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.320
<v Speaker 1>if not the best,</v>

152
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>one of the very best lightweights in the world.</v>

153
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

154
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>undefeated</v>

155
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 3>had his body shut down last time.</v>

156
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 3>He tried to make the weight and couldn't make the Tony Ferguson fight.</v>

157
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 3>They pulled him out and took him to the hospital.</v>

158
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.431
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

159
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:07.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

160
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm beating a dead horse here cause it's something that everybody knows.</v>

161
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's aware that it's a terrible,</v>

162
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:16.160
<v Speaker 3>terrible aspect of our sport.</v>

163
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 3>And in my mind it's contrary to what martial arts is supposed to be about.</v>

164
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 3>So in that sense,</v>

165
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.130
<v Speaker 3>I encourage Kelvin to stay at 185 pounds because obviously the guy's knocked out</v>

166
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 3>Vidor Belford at one 85 he just knocked out a former champion,</v>

167
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Michael Bisbing at 185 pounds.</v>

168
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:34.641
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

169
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:39.641
<v Speaker 3>he could knock on anybody at one 85 but a guy like Chris Weidman who is very</v>

170
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:43.040
<v Speaker 3>smart about cutting weight,</v>

171
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 3>he cuts a lot of weight,</v>

172
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 3>but he does it the right way.</v>

173
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:48.680
<v Speaker 3>Rehydrates the right way and he's just a fucking beast.</v>

174
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:49.880
<v Speaker 3>He's just so much bigger.</v>

175
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.660
<v Speaker 3>And when he got Kelvin to the ground and submitted him with a head and arm choke</v>

176
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.681
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>

177
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:57.470
<v Speaker 3>it just really seemed like that's the wrong way class for Calvin.</v>

178
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.020
<v Speaker 3>And then you see Calvin next fight,</v>

179
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 3>fight Bisbing and just fucking lights him up in the first round.</v>

180
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Now would he have been able to do that if he fought the Bisbing that was</v>

181
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:11.330
<v Speaker 3>training for George Saint Pierre.</v>

182
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

183
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 3>if Bisping did not have the George Saint Pierre fight and it just went right</v>

184
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:19.520
<v Speaker 3>into the Calvin Gasland fight with the same result of happen,</v>

185
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.190
<v Speaker 3>it could very well have the way Calvin hits,</v>

186
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 3>he's fast as fuck.</v>

187
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 3>His hands are beautiful.</v>

188
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.490
<v Speaker 3>He throws really crisp straight punches.</v>

189
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.510
<v Speaker 3>And in this sport it's,</v>

190
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.480
<v Speaker 3>there's not a whole lot of guys who have crisper,</v>

191
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:37.680
<v Speaker 3>sharper hands at 185 pounds.</v>

192
00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:38.514
<v Speaker 3>Then Calvin,</v>

193
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:38.931
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

194
00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:43.931
<v Speaker 3>he just has beautiful head movement and boxing and when he moves in for the kill</v>

195
00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:44.960
<v Speaker 3>with those hands,</v>

196
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.040
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

197
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 3>When you saw the Vito Belfort fight,</v>

198
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean he just fucking be tore up,</v>

199
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:54.640
<v Speaker 3>but those straight punches and he throws them efficiently and they have snapped</v>

200
00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:55.101
<v Speaker 3>to them.</v>

201
00:07:55.101 --> 00:07:55.934
<v Speaker 3>And just,</v>

202
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 3>and on top of that,</v>

203
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 3>he's a very good wrestler.</v>

204
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.851
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

205
00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:02.360
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people forget how good his wrestling skills are on top of all that.</v>

206
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.210
<v Speaker 3>He's just a real threat at 185 pounds.</v>

207
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.240
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating thing because it's just such a wide open division.</v>

208
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 3>He just called out,</v>

209
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.883
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

210
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.873
<v Speaker 3>Robert Whitaker,</v>

211
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.100
<v Speaker 3>who was the interim champion of course,</v>

212
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 3>and a call that Whittaker and wants Whitaker to,</v>

213
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:20.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

214
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.890
<v Speaker 3>to fight him next.</v>

215
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.353
<v Speaker 3>But of course,</v>

216
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.870
<v Speaker 3>Robert Whitaker is a waiting for the big pay day.</v>

217
00:08:26.871 --> 00:08:29.690
<v Speaker 3>I would too if I was him to fight George St Pierre.</v>

218
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:31.640
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>

219
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 3>it's a wide open division now that Saint Pierre choked out.</v>

220
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Michael Bisbing and then Gelt Kelvin just lights up.</v>

221
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:38.573
<v Speaker 3>Bisping.</v>

222
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>

223
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.210
<v Speaker 3>you've got to think that Weidman is still in the mix.</v>

224
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:44.601
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

225
00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:47.030
<v Speaker 3>even though why been lost to Yoel Romero.</v>

226
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.000
<v Speaker 3>And then last two gig garden was saucy.</v>

227
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.260
<v Speaker 3>He's still in the mix.</v>

228
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:51.780
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

229
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.990
<v Speaker 3>he was winning that Yoel Romero fight,</v>

230
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:55.650
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion until he got caught,</v>

231
00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 3>was that wicked flying knee.</v>

232
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 3>But that's the danger of fighting Gol Romero,</v>

233
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.760
<v Speaker 3>you all Romero could do that to anybody in the world.</v>

234
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 3>He's just such a fucking freak athlete.</v>

235
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

236
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.493
<v Speaker 3>so really,</v>

237
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.200
<v Speaker 3>really wide open division.</v>

238
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:14.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm bombed as fuck that gay guard went over.</v>

239
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:14.971
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

240
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

241
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.021
<v Speaker 3>decided to,</v>

242
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:16.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

243
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.160
<v Speaker 3>fight for bell tour,</v>

244
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:17.994
<v Speaker 3>but I get it,</v>

245
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:18.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

246
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:23.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean these guys got to go where the money is and at Pella tour he easily could</v>

247
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:23.791
<v Speaker 3>be a champion.</v>

248
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:26.010
<v Speaker 3>I think he could be a champion in the UFC as well.</v>

249
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.950
<v Speaker 3>And maybe we will see him in the UFC again.</v>

250
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:29.161
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

251
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:33.420
<v Speaker 3>he could easily find a year or two over in the UFC and then come back over.</v>

252
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.130
<v Speaker 3>K guard is still relatively young,</v>

253
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.980
<v Speaker 3>but it's nice to have competition.</v>

254
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 3>I think competition is good for everybody and I think it,</v>

255
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:42.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

256
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.740
<v Speaker 3>I think it really elevates the sport.</v>

257
00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:45.210
<v Speaker 3>It elevates the level of sport.</v>

258
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:45.951
<v Speaker 3>I end it,</v>

259
00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:50.951
<v Speaker 3>you could see by the results that a lot of these UFC fighters are having.</v>

260
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:51.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

261
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.780
<v Speaker 3>especially Lorens Larkin who is very good,</v>

262
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:55.471
<v Speaker 3>he's a very,</v>

263
00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:56.460
<v Speaker 3>very good striker.</v>

264
00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.690
<v Speaker 3>He loses to Lima in a bid for the title and then loses by,</v>

265
00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:04.590
<v Speaker 3>knock out to the always dangerous pol daily.</v>

266
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.410
<v Speaker 3>So I think Bella tore it.</v>

267
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:07.831
<v Speaker 3>And now,</v>

268
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:09.720
<v Speaker 3>especially in that 170 pound division,</v>

269
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:13.860
<v Speaker 3>you've got Rory McDonald bell tours really showing they have absolute world</v>

270
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:14.970
<v Speaker 3>championship caliber,</v>

271
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.100
<v Speaker 3>caliber talent over there.</v>

272
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.740
<v Speaker 3>So to get back to that fight,</v>

273
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

274
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.150
<v Speaker 3>I agree entirely with a,</v>

275
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.630
<v Speaker 3>to get back to the Bisbing and,</v>

276
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:24.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

277
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.130
<v Speaker 3>Calvin Gasol and fight,</v>

278
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.640
<v Speaker 3>I agree 100% with what Brendan Schaub said,</v>

279
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.570
<v Speaker 3>that you really have to protect a fighter from themselves.</v>

280
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 3>You really can't be letting a guy fight three weeks after an absolutely brutal</v>

281
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:38.941
<v Speaker 3>fight like that.</v>

282
00:10:38.941 --> 00:10:40.440
<v Speaker 3>It just does not make sense.</v>

283
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.940
<v Speaker 3>It just does not make sense.</v>

284
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

285
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's smart.</v>

286
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:44.671
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

287
00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:48.990
<v Speaker 3>I understand that UFC needed someone to fill in and short notice because</v>

288
00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Silva tested positive for performance enhancing drugs and they did not</v>

289
00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:55.440
<v Speaker 3>want to lose the,</v>

290
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:55.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

291
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.390
<v Speaker 3>Shanghai main event.</v>

292
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:02.920
<v Speaker 3>So it turns into an even bigger fight when you've got the former middleweight</v>

293
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.630
<v Speaker 3>champion right off of his last three weeks later fighting again.</v>

294
00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:07.464
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

295
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:09.630
<v Speaker 3>it's just not smart.</v>

296
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.490
<v Speaker 3>I know Bisping wanted to do it.</v>

297
00:11:11.491 --> 00:11:13.680
<v Speaker 3>I know Bisping would probably do it again if you asked to do,</v>

298
00:11:13.681 --> 00:11:13.930
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

299
00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.080
<v Speaker 3>if you ask Bisbing to fight in a couple of weeks of probably,</v>

300
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.130
<v Speaker 3>probably do it again.</v>

301
00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:17.964
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

302
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:18.631
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

303
00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:19.464
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

304
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.220
<v Speaker 3>someone was talking about him fighting in England,</v>

305
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.300
<v Speaker 3>I believe in March,</v>

306
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:25.134
<v Speaker 3>which</v>

307
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>

308
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.511
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

309
00:11:27.511 --> 00:11:28.620
<v Speaker 3>that's less crazy,</v>

310
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:29.790
<v Speaker 3>but still crazy,</v>

311
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.300
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

312
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:30.631
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>

313
00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:30.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

314
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.940
<v Speaker 3>we're basically an into December.</v>

315
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:35.520
<v Speaker 3>So you got December,</v>

316
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:35.520
<v Speaker 3>January,</v>

317
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.000
<v Speaker 3>February,</v>

318
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 3>three months off really,</v>

319
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.491
<v Speaker 3>and then march.</v>

320
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:42.880
<v Speaker 3>But of course during that time he's going to be sparring and you know,</v>

321
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:43.231
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

322
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:43.741
<v Speaker 3>Bisping,</v>

323
00:11:43.741 --> 00:11:44.730
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking animal.</v>

324
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.440
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to train easy.</v>

325
00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:47.880
<v Speaker 3>He's not gonna take much time off.</v>

326
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:48.931
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

327
00:11:48.931 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

328
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of debate as to how much time a fighter should be forced to take</v>

329
00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Speaker 3>off after they get knocked out.</v>

330
00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:58.660
<v Speaker 3>And here's the thing about that.</v>

331
00:11:59.580 --> 00:11:59.830
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

332
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing guys</v>

333
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.020
<v Speaker 3>when they're fighting and you're seeing them getting knocked down and you're</v>

334
00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:06.040
<v Speaker 3>seeing them fighting,</v>

335
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:06.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

336
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:08.200
<v Speaker 3>x amount of months later.</v>

337
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.490
<v Speaker 3>So you saw Bisping,</v>

338
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:11.230
<v Speaker 3>he didn't get knocked out by George Saint Pierre,</v>

339
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 3>but he's certainly got rocked with that left hook.</v>

340
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.110
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

341
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

342
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.640
<v Speaker 3>he got choked out when he was on the ground.</v>

343
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.483
<v Speaker 3>I now,</v>

344
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.450
<v Speaker 3>for people who don't know a lot about MMA,</v>

345
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.460
<v Speaker 3>getting choked out is not nearly as bad as getting knocked out.</v>

346
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:24.760
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

347
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.960
<v Speaker 3>there's almost nothing to it.</v>

348
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 3>The way to look at it is if you look at a garden hose and you know how to give</v>

349
00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:31.450
<v Speaker 3>Ben the garden hose,</v>

350
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.930
<v Speaker 3>crimp it down and it stops the water from coming out.</v>

351
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.820
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what happens to your fucking brain when you get choked out.</v>

352
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:40.930
<v Speaker 3>When you get choked out,</v>

353
00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:42.280
<v Speaker 3>it's basically cutting off the blood.</v>

354
00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:42.761
<v Speaker 3>Your brain,</v>

355
00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:44.170
<v Speaker 3>you wake up and you're fine.</v>

356
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.690
<v Speaker 3>You don't have memory issues,</v>

357
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.760
<v Speaker 3>you don't have balance issues for the most part,</v>

358
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:50.830
<v Speaker 3>especially if you've only been out for a couple of seconds.</v>

359
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:51.640
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

360
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.850
<v Speaker 3>it happens all of the time in training.</v>

361
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:55.660
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

362
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.770
<v Speaker 3>I've seen many,</v>

363
00:12:56.771 --> 00:12:58.750
<v Speaker 3>many guys get choked unconscious.</v>

364
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.520
<v Speaker 3>I've choked people unconscious.</v>

365
00:13:00.521 --> 00:13:01.870
<v Speaker 3>They come back and they're fine.</v>

366
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.030
<v Speaker 3>It's not that big of a deal,</v>

367
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.780
<v Speaker 3>but you got to realize before he got choked unconscious,</v>

368
00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:10.180
<v Speaker 3>he got hit with a big fucking lefthand and hurt.</v>

369
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.160
<v Speaker 3>And it was a great fight before that.</v>

370
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:12.790
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

371
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.790
<v Speaker 3>both guys were were giving and tanking fighters need time off after fights.</v>

372
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.540
<v Speaker 3>So you're seeing that,</v>

373
00:13:19.541 --> 00:13:19.781
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

374
00:13:19.781 --> 00:13:23.890
<v Speaker 3>You're seeing the actual competition between George Saint Pierre,</v>

375
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:24.491
<v Speaker 3>Michael Bisping.</v>

376
00:13:24.491 --> 00:13:27.820
<v Speaker 3>What were you not seeing is how many times he got hit during training?</v>

377
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.320
<v Speaker 3>Did he get rocked ever?</v>

378
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.390
<v Speaker 3>Did he get clipped and dropped a,</v>

379
00:13:31.391 --> 00:13:35.050
<v Speaker 3>did he get dropped and heard and take a couple of days off and then get back to</v>

380
00:13:35.051 --> 00:13:35.884
<v Speaker 3>training again?</v>

381
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Only he knows.</v>

382
00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:40.240
<v Speaker 3>Only his camp knows and most of the times they're not talking.</v>

383
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.920
<v Speaker 3>But you hear about it all the time.</v>

384
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:42.911
<v Speaker 3>And matter of fact,</v>

385
00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:44.710
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to Forrest Griffin wants,</v>

386
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.140
<v Speaker 3>and Forrest was telling me that before he fought Anderson Silva,</v>

387
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.590
<v Speaker 3>he was knocked unconscious twice in training.</v>

388
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.360
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking crazy.</v>

389
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:56.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

390
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.700
<v Speaker 3>here he is</v>

391
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:03.820
<v Speaker 3>about to fight the greatest pound for pound fighter of all time.</v>

392
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:04.900
<v Speaker 3>Next to,</v>

393
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean if there's,</v>

394
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:05.740
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

395
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.630
<v Speaker 3>there's three guys in that debate,</v>

396
00:14:07.631 --> 00:14:08.464
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

397
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.980
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

398
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.500
<v Speaker 3>my number one guy right now is mighty mouse.</v>

399
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.700
<v Speaker 3>I think just he,</v>

400
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 3>he represents the highest skill level.</v>

401
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.000
<v Speaker 3>But does he represent the highest competition level in terms of like the guys</v>

402
00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:19.834
<v Speaker 3>he's faced?</v>

403
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

404
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.490
<v Speaker 3>I think number one competition level is Jon Jones.</v>

405
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Jon Jones has choked out Liotta Machida rampage Jackson.</v>

406
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.880
<v Speaker 3>He's beat Rashad Evans.</v>

407
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.730
<v Speaker 3>He beat Alexander Gustafson,</v>

408
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.150
<v Speaker 3>he'd beat Glover to sharer.</v>

409
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.640
<v Speaker 3>He beat Vitor Belfort.</v>

410
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.760
<v Speaker 3>He beat Daniel Cormier twice.</v>

411
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:40.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean fuck,</v>

412
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.760
<v Speaker 3>he's beating everybody.</v>

413
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.830
<v Speaker 3>I think you look at competition wise,</v>

414
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.240
<v Speaker 3>Jon Jones is a very strong argument for the greatest of all time,</v>

415
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.700
<v Speaker 3>but Anderson Silva's fucking bright there too,</v>

416
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:53.001
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

417
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:54.680
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Silva in his prime.</v>

418
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.750
<v Speaker 3>I think when you look at the way he knocked out,</v>

419
00:14:56.751 --> 00:14:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Vitor Belfort with that front kick to the face,</v>

420
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the way he fought,</v>

421
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:03.900
<v Speaker 3>Forrest Griffin in,</v>

422
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.480
<v Speaker 3>in that fight that we were just talking about,</v>

423
00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:10.070
<v Speaker 3>and k owed him like a magician the way he fought Stephan Bonner and literally</v>

424
00:15:10.071 --> 00:15:11.510
<v Speaker 3>put his back up against the cage.</v>

425
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.343
<v Speaker 3>They again,</v>

426
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.660
<v Speaker 3>Stephan Bonner and Forrest Griffin to just,</v>

427
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:16.940
<v Speaker 3>no disrespect,</v>

428
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:22.270
<v Speaker 3>they're not at the same level as a Leo Machida or Glover to sharer or some of</v>

429
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:25.940
<v Speaker 3>the guys that Jon Jones has faced,</v>

430
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.460
<v Speaker 3>but it's the way Anderson beat them.</v>

431
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

432
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.920
<v Speaker 3>Anderson was just in his prime.</v>

433
00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:32.630
<v Speaker 3>He was off fucking master,</v>

434
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.950
<v Speaker 3>like a real master.</v>

435
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:35.893
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

436
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:41.180
<v Speaker 3>so Forrest Griffin fighting Anderson Silva after being Kao twice in training</v>

437
00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:43.400
<v Speaker 3>camp is just insane.</v>

438
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.900
<v Speaker 3>But these are the things that fighters do when they have to do them.</v>

439
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:48.231
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

440
00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:50.150
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about a giant pay day,</v>

441
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.590
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about a big fight.</v>

442
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.880
<v Speaker 3>You give the guy a chance like,</v>

443
00:15:52.881 --> 00:15:53.630
<v Speaker 3>do you want to fight?</v>

444
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:54.441
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you could fight?</v>

445
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:54.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

446
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:54.880
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

447
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.221
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

448
00:15:55.221 --> 00:15:55.431
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

449
00:15:55.431 --> 00:15:55.911
<v Speaker 3>I could do it.</v>

450
00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:56.744
<v Speaker 3>I could do it.</v>

451
00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.020
<v Speaker 3>And they go out there and they're compromised and they get clipped and you see</v>

452
00:16:00.021 --> 00:16:00.591
<v Speaker 3>it immediately.</v>

453
00:16:00.591 --> 00:16:01.424
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes.</v>

454
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.080
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you see guys,</v>

455
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.810
<v Speaker 3>they get clipped and you don't know what I mean.</v>

456
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.890
<v Speaker 3>They get hit with something and look at any day,</v>

457
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:13.550
<v Speaker 3>any time when a person is throwing a punch or kick at you and it connects,</v>

458
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:14.780
<v Speaker 3>it can put you out.</v>

459
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.450
<v Speaker 3>But there's no doubt at all,</v>

460
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.560
<v Speaker 3>no doubt about it,</v>

461
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:23.980
<v Speaker 3>that the resiliency of a fighter after they'd been KOD is compromised.</v>

462
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.720
<v Speaker 3>There's just no doubt about it.</v>

463
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:31.130
<v Speaker 3>When you see a guy who's been KOD and then you see them get hit weeks,</v>

464
00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:31.970
<v Speaker 3>months later,</v>

465
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.070
<v Speaker 3>they cannot take a shot at the same way.</v>

466
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Their brain is still recovering,</v>

467
00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:38.480
<v Speaker 3>their body is still recovering from the concussion.</v>

468
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:39.733
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

469
00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:45.080
<v Speaker 3>you have to figure out a way to balance being a risk taker and seizing an</v>

470
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:48.261
<v Speaker 3>opportunity,</v>

471
00:16:48.261 --> 00:16:53.261
<v Speaker 3>which is a huge opportunity versus concentrating on having a long and healthy</v>

472
00:16:54.321 --> 00:16:55.154
<v Speaker 3>career.</v>

473
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.080
<v Speaker 3>Now that said,</v>

474
00:16:57.081 --> 00:16:58.190
<v Speaker 3>for Michael Bisping,</v>

475
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.820
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of at the end of his career.</v>

476
00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:02.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

477
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.700
<v Speaker 3>he said essentially that he wants to fight one more time in England,</v>

478
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.820
<v Speaker 3>which would be beautiful for him and I hope they give him,</v>

479
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:08.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

480
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:08.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

481
00:17:08.601 --> 00:17:09.680
<v Speaker 3>a good matchup.</v>

482
00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.600
<v Speaker 3>So it'd be a good fight for the fans.</v>

483
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.730
<v Speaker 3>And I hope they give Michael some time off.</v>

484
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:14.750
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

485
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.550
<v Speaker 3>give the man some time to really relax and then go through a real nice three,</v>

486
00:17:19.551 --> 00:17:20.780
<v Speaker 3>four month training camp,</v>

487
00:17:20.781 --> 00:17:23.750
<v Speaker 3>get an excellent shape and give his best effort for one more.</v>

488
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:24.320
<v Speaker 3>Go at it.</v>

489
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.340
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see that,</v>

490
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:30.850
<v Speaker 3>but it might be the hardest shit in the world to talk a fighter into retiring or</v>

491
00:17:32.931 --> 00:17:35.450
<v Speaker 3>to for a fighter to figure out when to retire.</v>

492
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.060
<v Speaker 3>I was just talking to Matt Brown.</v>

493
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:38.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

494
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.690
<v Speaker 3>he came to see me in Denver and I was telling him,</v>

495
00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:41.991
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

496
00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:42.321
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

497
00:17:42.321 --> 00:17:44.390
<v Speaker 3>that fight that you have with Diego Sanchez,</v>

498
00:17:44.391 --> 00:17:45.740
<v Speaker 3>what a perfect way to go out.</v>

499
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:46.731
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful,</v>

500
00:17:46.731 --> 00:17:48.090
<v Speaker 3>spectacular knockouts,</v>

501
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.340
<v Speaker 3>Classic Matt Brown fight.</v>

502
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.510
<v Speaker 3>Just blood and guts.</v>

503
00:17:51.511 --> 00:17:56.010
<v Speaker 3>He's one of my all time favorite fighters to watch for sure because he's so</v>

504
00:17:56.011 --> 00:17:57.810
<v Speaker 3>fucking for Roche's.</v>

505
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.200
<v Speaker 3>You knew when you were going to go to see a matte brown fight.</v>

506
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.280
<v Speaker 3>If Matt Brown was fighting,</v>

507
00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:03.061
<v Speaker 3>anybody win,</v>

508
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:03.960
<v Speaker 3>lose or draw,</v>

509
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:07.620
<v Speaker 3>that guy was going to have to face hell.</v>

510
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.990
<v Speaker 3>Matt Brown would bring it in.</v>

511
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:15.020
<v Speaker 3>The four Rosti intensity that that guy would bring inside the octagon is just</v>

512
00:18:15.781 --> 00:18:16.614
<v Speaker 3>unrivaled.</v>

513
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.780
<v Speaker 3>And I think about Matt is,</v>

514
00:18:18.781 --> 00:18:19.170
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

515
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.670
<v Speaker 3>he's not like an unbelievably physically gifted guy.</v>

516
00:18:22.671 --> 00:18:25.610
<v Speaker 3>He's not like some Kevin Randleman character.</v>

517
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:26.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

518
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.500
<v Speaker 3>there's been guys that are just physical freaks.</v>

519
00:18:28.501 --> 00:18:28.801
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

520
00:18:28.801 --> 00:18:30.180
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Rumble Johnson,</v>

521
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.270
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

522
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.520
<v Speaker 3>you know Brock Lesnar,</v>

523
00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:32.790
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

524
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.650
<v Speaker 3>there's guys that are just physically,</v>

525
00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:35.850
<v Speaker 3>they're just freakish.</v>

526
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.340
<v Speaker 3>They can do things that are just incredibly unusual.</v>

527
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:43.730
<v Speaker 3>And then there's guys that their mind is just unbreakable.</v>

528
00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:48.831
<v Speaker 3>They're just off fucking warrior to the core down to the cells.</v>

529
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.100
<v Speaker 3>That's Matt Brown and Matt Brown can lose.</v>

530
00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:54.270
<v Speaker 3>He's lost before,</v>

531
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.590
<v Speaker 3>but he just loses because his body gives out.</v>

532
00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.870
<v Speaker 3>It's never because his mind gives out.</v>

533
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean that guy is coming to fucking kill you every time he gets into that</v>

534
00:19:05.131 --> 00:19:05.964
<v Speaker 3>octagon.</v>

535
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.440
<v Speaker 3>And I loved that about him.</v>

536
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's one of my all time favorite fighters to watch for sure.</v>

537
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.520
<v Speaker 3>And when I was telling him a congratulations,</v>

538
00:19:14.521 --> 00:19:16.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's an amazing way to cap off a career.</v>

539
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:17.520
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

540
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.570
<v Speaker 3>might not be the last one.</v>

541
00:19:18.571 --> 00:19:19.290
<v Speaker 3>So he's still,</v>

542
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:19.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

543
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.680
<v Speaker 3>even after going through all those wars,</v>

544
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:23.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

545
00:19:23.191 --> 00:19:24.420
<v Speaker 3>he's in his thirties now,</v>

546
00:19:24.421 --> 00:19:29.421
<v Speaker 3>I believe he's like 35 I think he is maybe 36 and you know,</v>

547
00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:30.810
<v Speaker 3>still wondering.</v>

548
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.640
<v Speaker 3>I think he's 36 it's still wondering like is this it to go one more do one more,</v>

549
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.833
<v Speaker 3>one more.</v>

550
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.870
<v Speaker 3>Cause the thrill that you experience.</v>

551
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously I've never fought inside the octagon so I'm just guessing.</v>

552
00:19:42.811 --> 00:19:45.390
<v Speaker 3>But the thrill of just fighting in general,</v>

553
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:50.420
<v Speaker 3>it's such a much higher level of danger and excitement than most people</v>

554
00:19:52.711 --> 00:19:57.711
<v Speaker 3>experience in everyday life and it's incredibly addictive and it makes regular</v>

555
00:19:58.321 --> 00:20:02.190
<v Speaker 3>life seem dull and gray in comparison.</v>

556
00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.170
<v Speaker 3>When those guys get into the octagon,</v>

557
00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:08.670
<v Speaker 3>when a guy like Matt Brown smashes an elbow down on Diego Sanchez and Diego</v>

558
00:20:08.671 --> 00:20:11.640
<v Speaker 3>slumps and goes limp and the crowd goes insane.</v>

559
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.930
<v Speaker 3>And you know when just when Matt got into the octagon,</v>

560
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.120
<v Speaker 3>there's a crazy video of the fight while we're watching the fight,</v>

561
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Matt steps into the octagon steps through the cage and fucking roars.</v>

562
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean raw bars,</v>

563
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.750
<v Speaker 3>like you see it in his face,</v>

564
00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:32.010
<v Speaker 3>you see it in his eyes.</v>

565
00:20:32.011 --> 00:20:36.810
<v Speaker 3>He just opens his mouth and screams that mother fucker was there to fight.</v>

566
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.980
<v Speaker 3>That's what he loves to do.</v>

567
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.470
<v Speaker 3>And it was finally there.</v>

568
00:20:40.471 --> 00:20:41.460
<v Speaker 3>It was finally happening.</v>

569
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.890
<v Speaker 3>It gets to the training camp steps into that octagon.</v>

570
00:20:43.891 --> 00:20:44.640
<v Speaker 3>It's go time.</v>

571
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.290
<v Speaker 3>That is is exciting as life is going to be for him or for,</v>

572
00:20:49.291 --> 00:20:51.640
<v Speaker 3>for any combat sports athlete.</v>

573
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 3>And it is incredibly,</v>

574
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:55.840
<v Speaker 3>incredibly hard to give that up.</v>

575
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.570
<v Speaker 3>Once you've experienced that man,</v>

576
00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

577
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.250
<v Speaker 3>you see it in these guys.</v>

578
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:03.430
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard for them to know when to walk away,</v>

579
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:09.330
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's incredibly critical to balance out the glory of Combat Sports,</v>

580
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:15.691
<v Speaker 3>the glory of giving your all and going out on your shield sometimes and</v>

581
00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:20.170
<v Speaker 3>sometimes winning with vicious knockout or incredible submission,</v>

582
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.440
<v Speaker 3>but knowing when the body has taken enough,</v>

583
00:21:23.441 --> 00:21:28.210
<v Speaker 3>knowing when your vehicle is damaged to the point where you should not be</v>

584
00:21:28.211 --> 00:21:30.010
<v Speaker 3>engaging in competition anymore.</v>

585
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.030
<v Speaker 3>And it's different for everybody and it's so hard to figure out when,</v>

586
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.500
<v Speaker 3>and some guys just know,</v>

587
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:36.970
<v Speaker 3>some guys just know and they'll go,</v>

588
00:21:36.971 --> 00:21:37.451
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

589
00:21:37.451 --> 00:21:38.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>

590
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:38.883
<v Speaker 3>It's it,</v>

591
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:39.551
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

592
00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:40.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel it anymore.</v>

593
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:41.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to step away.</v>

594
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.023
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

595
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.730
<v Speaker 3>Tj grants a good example of that.</v>

596
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.130
<v Speaker 3>Here's a guy that was supposed to be fighting for the title.</v>

597
00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:52.240
<v Speaker 3>He's about to fight for the UFC lightweight title and nobody ever heard from him</v>

598
00:21:52.241 --> 00:21:52.541
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

599
00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:54.460
<v Speaker 3>He was suffering from concussion syndrome.</v>

600
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.690
<v Speaker 3>He just had real hard time recovering from a concussion that he gotten training</v>

601
00:21:59.290 --> 00:21:59.980
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

602
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:00.970
<v Speaker 3>never fought again.</v>

603
00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:02.570
<v Speaker 3>Took a regular job,</v>

604
00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:03.640
<v Speaker 3>but he's done some training,</v>

605
00:22:03.641 --> 00:22:04.870
<v Speaker 3>training fighters and stuff,</v>

606
00:22:04.871 --> 00:22:08.260
<v Speaker 3>but never decided to get back into the octagon again.</v>

607
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.340
<v Speaker 3>Chris Holdsworth and other example got a training injury,</v>

608
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.670
<v Speaker 3>get hit in the head and training real bad,</v>

609
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.190
<v Speaker 3>got a concussion and um,</v>

610
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.630
<v Speaker 3>decided to stop.</v>

611
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:20.613
<v Speaker 3>And that was it.</v>

612
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.090
<v Speaker 3>Very hard for these guys to figure out when.</v>

613
00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:26.381
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

614
00:22:26.381 --> 00:22:27.214
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

615
00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.270
<v Speaker 3>next Saturday,</v>

616
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.890
<v Speaker 3>December 2nd,</v>

617
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.570
<v Speaker 3>there's a big fight.</v>

618
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:35.940
<v Speaker 3>It's the rematch between Max Holloway and Josie Aldo.</v>

619
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:40.900
<v Speaker 3>You also have Alistair Overeem and Francis in Ghana on that card.</v>

620
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:41.763
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

621
00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.790
<v Speaker 3>Henry said Udo and Sergio Pettis,</v>

622
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.640
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Alvarez,</v>

623
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.830
<v Speaker 3>and just engaging who?</v>

624
00:22:50.831 --> 00:22:53.170
<v Speaker 3>Just those four fights,</v>

625
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:53.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

626
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.350
<v Speaker 3>Their whole Lee Shit.</v>

627
00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.970
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

628
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:59.351
<v Speaker 3>I know a,</v>

629
00:22:59.351 --> 00:23:02.440
<v Speaker 3>I talked about Holloway versus all though before.</v>

630
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.161
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

631
00:23:03.161 --> 00:23:06.160
<v Speaker 3>what I like about this fight is first of all,</v>

632
00:23:06.161 --> 00:23:07.750
<v Speaker 3>the first fight was very good until,</v>

633
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:08.350
<v Speaker 3>although,</v>

634
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:09.183
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

635
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.170
<v Speaker 3>ran out of gas and Holloway took over.</v>

636
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.250
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

637
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:15.940
<v Speaker 3>all those camp was saying that going into that fight all though had a leg</v>

638
00:23:15.941 --> 00:23:16.774
<v Speaker 3>injury,</v>

639
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:19.390
<v Speaker 3>which kind of makes sense because you really didn't throw many leg kicks,</v>

640
00:23:19.391 --> 00:23:22.720
<v Speaker 3>but he also didn't throw very many leg kicks against Frankie Edgar.</v>

641
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:26.920
<v Speaker 3>I think the strategy for then for that fight though was that he was worried</v>

642
00:23:26.921 --> 00:23:28.450
<v Speaker 3>about the takedowns of Frankie Edgar.</v>

643
00:23:28.451 --> 00:23:30.970
<v Speaker 3>So he had decided to avoid being taken down.</v>

644
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.140
<v Speaker 3>One of the best ways to do it would be just to avoid kicking and just outbox</v>

645
00:23:35.141 --> 00:23:35.321
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

646
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:39.310
<v Speaker 3>And he did that very well in that fight and won a pretty clear unanimous</v>

647
00:23:39.311 --> 00:23:40.144
<v Speaker 3>decision.</v>

648
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:42.550
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be a different fighter.</v>

649
00:23:42.551 --> 00:23:45.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean Max Holloway is in his prime.</v>

650
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 3>He beat,</v>

651
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.770
<v Speaker 5>although the first time around isn't he?</v>

652
00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.650
<v Speaker 5>And he's incredibly confident there's going to be able to beat all the second</v>

653
00:23:51.651 --> 00:23:52.230
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

654
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:56.750
<v Speaker 5>All go though said that he had this leg injury and it prevented him from</v>

655
00:23:56.751 --> 00:23:58.970
<v Speaker 5>throwing leg kicks but that it's better now.</v>

656
00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:01.820
<v Speaker 5>And that's one of the reasons why he's excited about fighting Holloway again.</v>

657
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.870
<v Speaker 5>Now if that is the case and if all though is in tremendous shape,</v>

658
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:08.390
<v Speaker 5>cause he took this fight on relatively short notice,</v>

659
00:24:08.391 --> 00:24:10.640
<v Speaker 5>he did not get a full two,</v>

660
00:24:10.641 --> 00:24:12.080
<v Speaker 5>three month training camp.</v>

661
00:24:12.081 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 5>I think it was five weeks out,</v>

662
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:15.620
<v Speaker 5>maybe more.</v>

663
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry if I'm wrong about that.</v>

664
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm not looking at it right in front of me but I know it wasn't a full camp</v>

665
00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:26.411
<v Speaker 5>cause I know it was supposed to be Frankie Edgar Edgar got injured and so all</v>

666
00:24:26.811 --> 00:24:27.644
<v Speaker 5>those steps in,</v>

667
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:28.670
<v Speaker 5>so we're gonna find out,</v>

668
00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.480
<v Speaker 5>we're going to find out if Aldo can make the proper adjustments and whether or</v>

669
00:24:32.481 --> 00:24:36.290
<v Speaker 5>not the ability to throw leg kicks is going to make a difference because all</v>

670
00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:41.090
<v Speaker 5>those leg kicks classically in history have been some of the very best in the</v>

671
00:24:41.091 --> 00:24:41.420
<v Speaker 5>game.</v>

672
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.340
<v Speaker 5>If you look at his fight with Uriah Faber,</v>

673
00:24:43.341 --> 00:24:45.770
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the very best uses,</v>

674
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:50.930
<v Speaker 5>uses best use of leg kicks maybe in the featherweight division ever.</v>

675
00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.080
<v Speaker 5>And just smash Uriah Faber,</v>

676
00:24:53.081 --> 00:24:54.230
<v Speaker 5>his leg to the point where,</v>

677
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's one of the all time grossest and injuries and MMA you rise left leg</v>

678
00:24:58.521 --> 00:25:03.200
<v Speaker 5>was like twice the size of his right leg and had to do a bunch of crazy therapy</v>

679
00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:06.320
<v Speaker 5>to recover from him hyperbaric chamber.</v>

680
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:07.070
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

681
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.120
<v Speaker 5>he documented it.</v>

682
00:25:08.121 --> 00:25:08.954
<v Speaker 5>Your eyes.</v>

683
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:09.980
<v Speaker 5>He's such a cool dude.</v>

684
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.903
<v Speaker 5>He's uh,</v>

685
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.160
<v Speaker 5>I loved that he did this.</v>

686
00:25:12.161 --> 00:25:12.680
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

687
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.010
<v Speaker 5>he documented a lot of the injury online to show everybody like,</v>

688
00:25:16.011 --> 00:25:17.660
<v Speaker 5>look how fucked up my leg is.</v>

689
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:19.063
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

690
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.840
<v Speaker 5>that's all done at its best is although the same guy now,</v>

691
00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:28.841
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's gone through 29 professional MMA fights at the highest level.</v>

692
00:25:29.301 --> 00:25:32.870
<v Speaker 5>He's been a champion for a long time and you know,</v>

693
00:25:32.871 --> 00:25:33.860
<v Speaker 5>he's had some wars.</v>

694
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.380
<v Speaker 5>The second fight with Chad Mendez was a war.</v>

695
00:25:36.381 --> 00:25:39.780
<v Speaker 5>Of course he got stopped quick by Conor Mcgregor.</v>

696
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.680
<v Speaker 5>The fight with Max Holloway was a war.</v>

697
00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:42.891
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

698
00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:43.910
<v Speaker 5>he's been through some,</v>

699
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.470
<v Speaker 5>some really tough fights.</v>

700
00:25:45.471 --> 00:25:47.720
<v Speaker 5>Does he still have that same level?</v>

701
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:48.583
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

702
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.460
<v Speaker 5>we really don't know.</v>

703
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:50.840
<v Speaker 5>And we're going to find out,</v>

704
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.840
<v Speaker 5>hopefully we're going to find out from a an inch.</v>

705
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:54.141
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

706
00:25:54.141 --> 00:25:57.020
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what kind of camp he was involved in,</v>

707
00:25:57.021 --> 00:26:01.550
<v Speaker 5>like how hard he was training rather before he entered into camp for this</v>

708
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:03.170
<v Speaker 5>championship fight.</v>

709
00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm hoping that he was in good shape and that's one of the reasons why he was so</v>

710
00:26:06.741 --> 00:26:07.820
<v Speaker 5>eager to take the fight.</v>

711
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.490
<v Speaker 5>And we're gonna find out we're going to fly out on Saturday night.</v>

712
00:26:10.491 --> 00:26:11.390
<v Speaker 5>And that's very interesting.</v>

713
00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:15.980
<v Speaker 5>But maybe even more interesting is Alistair Overeem and Francis in Ghana,</v>

714
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:18.570
<v Speaker 5>because Alistair are over.</v>

715
00:26:18.571 --> 00:26:20.720
<v Speaker 5>Overeem was one of the most experienced guys in the division.</v>

716
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.260
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>

717
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.770
<v Speaker 5>Overeem is the former dream heavyweight champion,</v>

718
00:26:24.771 --> 00:26:29.771
<v Speaker 5>former Strikeforce heavyweight champion and former k one grand Prix champion.</v>

719
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:35.320
<v Speaker 5>One of the very best kick boxers to ever fight in MMA without a doubt.</v>

720
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:40.960
<v Speaker 5>But you want to talk about a guy who has been in wars like let's Google Allister</v>

721
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:48.630
<v Speaker 5>overall record because it's gotta be fucking crazy.</v>

722
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.320
<v Speaker 5>As far as the number of times he's been stopped.</v>

723
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:52.800
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

724
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.390
<v Speaker 5>it's really fucking bananas.</v>

725
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:55.920
<v Speaker 5>Let's go and look.</v>

726
00:26:55.921 --> 00:26:58.000
<v Speaker 5>We'll first look at his MMA career.</v>

727
00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.230
<v Speaker 5>We'll count this up and this is no disrespect to him.</v>

728
00:27:01.231 --> 00:27:05.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm a huge Alistair Overeem fan and I'm not saying that he should retire or</v>

729
00:27:05.281 --> 00:27:06.570
<v Speaker 5>anything crazy like that,</v>

730
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:11.870
<v Speaker 5>but let's just take a look at how many times he's been stopped.</v>

731
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.650
<v Speaker 5>Just an MMA.</v>

732
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:14.221
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

733
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:17.670
<v Speaker 5>So he won two fights in a row,</v>

734
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.610
<v Speaker 5>a fantastic victory over Mark Hunt.</v>

735
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.640
<v Speaker 5>It Kod him with knees and one a split decision over for breezy over doom.</v>

736
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.270
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

737
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.710
<v Speaker 5>or actually a majority decision.</v>

738
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.070
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

739
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.791
<v Speaker 5>one of the referees,</v>

740
00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:32.100
<v Speaker 5>I guess call or one of the judges called it a draw.</v>

741
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.490
<v Speaker 5>I thought that was a very close decision,</v>

742
00:27:35.491 --> 00:27:37.680
<v Speaker 5>but I thought that [inaudible] was going to get the nod.</v>

743
00:27:37.681 --> 00:27:38.514
<v Speaker 5>Quite honestly.</v>

744
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:40.163
<v Speaker 5>Let's look at the,</v>

745
00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.580
<v Speaker 5>the times he's lost though.</v>

746
00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:42.370
<v Speaker 5>Steep.</v>

747
00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:42.561
<v Speaker 5>Amy.</v>

748
00:27:42.561 --> 00:27:42.781
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

749
00:27:42.781 --> 00:27:43.500
<v Speaker 5>chip.</v>

750
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.760
<v Speaker 5>When he fought for the title,</v>

751
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:45.600
<v Speaker 5>knocked him out.</v>

752
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.433
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

753
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.340
<v Speaker 5>Before that,</v>

754
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:52.620
<v Speaker 5>Ben Rothwell knocked him out before that Travis Browne knocked him out before</v>

755
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:55.710
<v Speaker 5>that Antonio big foot Silva knocked him out.</v>

756
00:27:55.711 --> 00:27:56.730
<v Speaker 5>Brutal knockout.</v>

757
00:27:56.731 --> 00:28:01.731
<v Speaker 5>So that's just within the last four years in the UFC.</v>

758
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:07.460
<v Speaker 5>He suffered for brutal knockouts before that surrogate Keratan off,</v>

759
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:09.361
<v Speaker 5>knocked him out.</v>

760
00:28:09.361 --> 00:28:11.130
<v Speaker 5>Brutal knockout in 2007,</v>

761
00:28:11.131 --> 00:28:11.964
<v Speaker 5>10 years ago,</v>

762
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.760
<v Speaker 5>Mauricio Shogun Hua knocked them out.</v>

763
00:28:14.761 --> 00:28:16.260
<v Speaker 5>Also in 2007,</v>

764
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.220
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

765
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.930
<v Speaker 5>he lost to Ricardo Arona.</v>

766
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:21.300
<v Speaker 5>He got stopped in that fight.</v>

767
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:23.850
<v Speaker 5>He tapped two strikes,</v>

768
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:28.250
<v Speaker 5>a Ho Geria Nogueira uh,</v>

769
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.041
<v Speaker 5>stopped him.</v>

770
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:30.330
<v Speaker 5>Little Nog stopped him.</v>

771
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:31.561
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

772
00:28:31.561 --> 00:28:32.880
<v Speaker 5>his corner stopped it by,</v>

773
00:28:32.881 --> 00:28:33.870
<v Speaker 5>it's a Tko.</v>

774
00:28:33.871 --> 00:28:35.280
<v Speaker 5>That was in 2006.</v>

775
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.770
<v Speaker 5>He got stopped by Fabrizio over doom,</v>

776
00:28:37.771 --> 00:28:39.870
<v Speaker 5>but that was a Komora and that was a submission.</v>

777
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.213
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

778
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:43.230
<v Speaker 5>Shogun who,</v>

779
00:28:43.231 --> 00:28:44.010
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

780
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.000
<v Speaker 5>stopped him,</v>

781
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.223
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

782
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:51.260
<v Speaker 5>the first time in 2005 so shogun knocked him out twice.</v>

783
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:56.750
<v Speaker 5>He TKO them in 2005 and Kayo them in 2007 before that little Nog beat him by</v>

784
00:29:01.051 --> 00:29:06.051
<v Speaker 5>decision chocolate dealt k owed him and a fantastic fight where overin was</v>

785
00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:08.490
<v Speaker 5>really coming on strong against chuck.</v>

786
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:09.481
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

787
00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:09.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

788
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:13.320
<v Speaker 5>chuck caught him with some brutal punches and killed him.</v>

789
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:16.800
<v Speaker 5>That was in 2003 before that,</v>

790
00:29:16.801 --> 00:29:18.120
<v Speaker 5>Bobby Hoffman,</v>

791
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:23.010
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people forgot about Bobby Hoffman way back and rings.</v>

792
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:24.110
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

793
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:29.110
<v Speaker 5>Kay owed him in 2000 and that's it for MMA.</v>

794
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.650
<v Speaker 5>So just MMA chaos,</v>

795
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.190
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

796
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:36.900
<v Speaker 5>The first Kale loss.</v>

797
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.960
<v Speaker 5>We have Bobby Hoffman than we have chocolate,</v>

798
00:29:39.961 --> 00:29:40.794
<v Speaker 5>Dell.</v>

799
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.330
<v Speaker 5>Then we have shogun,</v>

800
00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.650
<v Speaker 5>then we have a little Nog,</v>

801
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.320
<v Speaker 5>then we have a Rona,</v>

802
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.450
<v Speaker 5>then we have shogun again.</v>

803
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.820
<v Speaker 5>Then we have Keratan off.</v>

804
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:55.391
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

805
00:29:55.391 --> 00:29:57.730
<v Speaker 5>We already have seven that's Keratan off.</v>

806
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.660
<v Speaker 5>Then we have big foot Silva,</v>

807
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.220
<v Speaker 5>eight Travis Browne,</v>

808
00:30:03.221 --> 00:30:05.260
<v Speaker 5>nine Ben Rothwell,</v>

809
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:07.330
<v Speaker 5>10 steep Emile Chick,</v>

810
00:30:07.331 --> 00:30:12.070
<v Speaker 5>1111 stoppage losses in MMA.</v>

811
00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:12.401
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

812
00:30:12.401 --> 00:30:14.680
<v Speaker 5>holy fucking shit.</v>

813
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:15.970
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

814
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.930
<v Speaker 5>11 knockout or stoppage losses in MMA.</v>

815
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.960
<v Speaker 5>Then you'd go to kickboxing.</v>

816
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.041
<v Speaker 5>Badr.</v>

817
00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:29.041
<v Speaker 5>Hari stopped him in the k one Grand Prix final in 2009.</v>

818
00:30:30.401 --> 00:30:31.330
<v Speaker 5>He stopped him.</v>

819
00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.493
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

820
00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:39.060
<v Speaker 5>he got stopped by Glob a Tosa in,</v>

821
00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:40.203
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

822
00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.270
<v Speaker 5>kill Kachin versus k one 2004,</v>

823
00:30:43.271 --> 00:30:44.190
<v Speaker 5>he got Kod.</v>

824
00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:49.890
<v Speaker 5>He got stopped by Bernard Paris and k one Holland.</v>

825
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:52.360
<v Speaker 5>That's in 2001,</v>

826
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.330
<v Speaker 5>so one,</v>

827
00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:56.320
<v Speaker 5>two,</v>

828
00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:01.680
<v Speaker 5>three k o losses and kickboxing on top of all the other MMA losses.</v>

829
00:31:02.681 --> 00:31:05.980
<v Speaker 5>So that's a lot of fucking stoppage losses folks.</v>

830
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:11.610
<v Speaker 5>And it's led people to question the durability of the current guy.</v>

831
00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:19.050
<v Speaker 5>But what we do know is that Allister is extremely crafty and one of the things</v>

832
00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:25.111
<v Speaker 5>that I like about Allister these days as since he's gone over to Jackson</v>

833
00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:28.120
<v Speaker 5>Winkeljohn in Albuquerque,</v>

834
00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.700
<v Speaker 5>he has become much more elusive,</v>

835
00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.600
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

836
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.610
<v Speaker 5>much slicker on his feet,</v>

837
00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:37.930
<v Speaker 5>moves around a lot more and doesn't just try to smash people.</v>

838
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.340
<v Speaker 5>The Uber Ream,</v>

839
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:44.080
<v Speaker 5>the guy that we saw fight Brock Lesnar when the,</v>

840
00:31:44.081 --> 00:31:46.750
<v Speaker 5>in his UFC debut that was like classic Uber,</v>

841
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:51.780
<v Speaker 5>which is Jack to the tits smash and people running through people he would meet</v>

842
00:31:51.971 --> 00:31:53.500
<v Speaker 5>force with greater force.</v>

843
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:58.800
<v Speaker 5>Now what you're seeing is we're seeing as the ouster over him the fuck junior</v>

844
00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:00.850
<v Speaker 5>dos Santos who farted,</v>

845
00:32:00.851 --> 00:32:02.260
<v Speaker 5>incredibly clever fight,</v>

846
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.490
<v Speaker 5>moved around.</v>

847
00:32:03.491 --> 00:32:04.324
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

848
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:05.140
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

849
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.640
<v Speaker 5>he was very,</v>

850
00:32:06.641 --> 00:32:07.540
<v Speaker 5>very slick,</v>

851
00:32:07.541 --> 00:32:12.070
<v Speaker 5>very difficult to hit and then started scoring on junior and then eventually</v>

852
00:32:12.071 --> 00:32:14.890
<v Speaker 5>caught him with a beautiful left hook and Kale at him.</v>

853
00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:20.550
<v Speaker 5>That's that to me is the interesting Andre Arlovski as tea today.</v>

854
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:26.040
<v Speaker 5>A guy who realizes that perhaps you can't take a punch like you did when he was</v>

855
00:32:26.201 --> 00:32:26.710
<v Speaker 5>younger.</v>

856
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.950
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

857
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:28.180
<v Speaker 5>he's been in a lot of really,</v>

858
00:32:28.181 --> 00:32:31.510
<v Speaker 5>really tough fights as we just went over and realized,</v>

859
00:32:31.511 --> 00:32:31.811
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

860
00:32:31.811 --> 00:32:32.021
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

861
00:32:32.021 --> 00:32:33.040
<v Speaker 5>now I have to be smart.</v>

862
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:34.570
<v Speaker 5>Now I have to be clever.</v>

863
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.820
<v Speaker 5>I have to move around a lot and I have to use my skills.</v>

864
00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:38.620
<v Speaker 5>And his skills are substantial.</v>

865
00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.621
<v Speaker 5>In my opinion.</v>

866
00:32:39.621 --> 00:32:40.460
<v Speaker 5>He's the best,</v>

867
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:40.901
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

868
00:32:40.901 --> 00:32:43.250
<v Speaker 5>right up there with mark on of course,</v>

869
00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.090
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

870
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.990
<v Speaker 5>who he just beat the best heavyweight kickboxer every money it comes to</v>

871
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:48.740
<v Speaker 5>credentials.</v>

872
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.341
<v Speaker 5>He's the best.</v>

873
00:32:49.341 --> 00:32:51.410
<v Speaker 5>Kevin heavyweight kickboxer ever in MMA.</v>

874
00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.060
<v Speaker 5>Really a no,</v>

875
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:56.290
<v Speaker 5>no heavyweight kickboxer other than him and hunt have everyone,</v>

876
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.460
<v Speaker 5>the k one Grand Prix and hunt one it,</v>

877
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.950
<v Speaker 5>he stepped into the finals as an alternate.</v>

878
00:33:00.951 --> 00:33:02.450
<v Speaker 5>He had lost earlier that night.</v>

879
00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:03.291
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

880
00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:05.300
<v Speaker 5>not to take anything away from hunt because of course,</v>

881
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:10.130
<v Speaker 5>Mark Honda is still just one of the all time greats when it comes to kickboxing.</v>

882
00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.260
<v Speaker 5>But when Mark Hunt One,</v>

883
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.090
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

884
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:15.290
<v Speaker 5>he one,</v>

885
00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:17.180
<v Speaker 5>we can go to that record right here,</v>

886
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.650
<v Speaker 5>Mark Hunt One,</v>

887
00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:19.240
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

888
00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.740
<v Speaker 5>the k one grand Prix he wanted,</v>

889
00:33:21.741 --> 00:33:23.630
<v Speaker 5>he had lost that night.</v>

890
00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:25.360
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

891
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.940
<v Speaker 5>see,</v>

892
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:26.121
<v Speaker 5>see,</v>

893
00:33:26.121 --> 00:33:26.421
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

894
00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:28.430
<v Speaker 5>he's fought the Caitlin Grand Prix a couple of times.</v>

895
00:33:28.431 --> 00:33:30.630
<v Speaker 5>He lost a semi shelt uh,</v>

896
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:35.680
<v Speaker 5>he got a Tki owed by a spinning back kick and he won.</v>

897
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:36.613
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

898
00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:37.630
<v Speaker 5>why don't I say God damn,</v>

899
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.460
<v Speaker 5>he's fought a lot of fucking awesome kickboxing fights too.</v>

900
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:46.930
<v Speaker 5>So he lost to race CFO in 2001 and the semifinals.</v>

901
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.570
<v Speaker 5>And then he won that night.</v>

902
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.550
<v Speaker 5>He beat Stefan Leco.</v>

903
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

904
00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:00.560
<v Speaker 5>So he lost to Ray Sefo.</v>

905
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:05.590
<v Speaker 5>Ray Sefo apparently couldn't continue and then he came back to win from getting</v>

906
00:34:05.811 --> 00:34:06.410
<v Speaker 5>that right.</v>

907
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:07.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

908
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.070
<v Speaker 5>It looks like he beat Stefan Leco</v>

909
00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:11.851
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>

910
00:34:11.851 --> 00:34:12.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

911
00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:15.930
<v Speaker 5>75 watts has semifinals says winds,</v>

912
00:34:15.931 --> 00:34:18.660
<v Speaker 5>k one Grand Prix championship 2001.</v>

913
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.790
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

914
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:20.430
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

915
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:23.400
<v Speaker 5>He fought Francisco Filio but that was in,</v>

916
00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:25.110
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at a different date.</v>

917
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.800
<v Speaker 5>That was in,</v>

918
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

919
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:33.050
<v Speaker 5>2002 or 2001 he'd be feeling,</v>

920
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:33.913
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>

921
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm rambling.</v>

922
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:36.140
<v Speaker 5>Did you notice?</v>

923
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:36.973
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

924
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:37.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking too much.</v>

925
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:38.390
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

926
00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:38.960
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

927
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.520
<v Speaker 5>so he's fighting Frances,</v>

928
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:45.020
<v Speaker 5>Frances and Ghana and Francis and Ghana who is right now 10 and one of the UFC</v>

929
00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:45.760
<v Speaker 5>10,</v>

930
00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.100
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

931
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.890
<v Speaker 5>ten one with a zero draws.</v>

932
00:34:48.891 --> 00:34:51.590
<v Speaker 5>So 10 wins and it's just been smashing everybody.</v>

933
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:55.010
<v Speaker 5>And if he looked at his last fight against Andre Arlovski,</v>

934
00:34:55.011 --> 00:34:57.260
<v Speaker 5>that was a fight where it's like probably one of the first fights where we</v>

935
00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:58.130
<v Speaker 5>really got tested.</v>

936
00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:02.780
<v Speaker 5>We really got to see what happens when he fights a former champion,</v>

937
00:35:02.781 --> 00:35:07.640
<v Speaker 5>a former really world class fighter and a,</v>

938
00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:08.750
<v Speaker 5>it was a good test,</v>

939
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.800
<v Speaker 5>but now a bigger test is in front of them when he's going to fight.</v>

940
00:35:12.801 --> 00:35:13.790
<v Speaker 5>Alistair Overeem,</v>

941
00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:16.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean we've seen him so far,</v>

942
00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.190
<v Speaker 5>four times inside the octagon.</v>

943
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:20.360
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

944
00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.600
<v Speaker 5>he stopped Curtis blades by knockout.</v>

945
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:25.460
<v Speaker 5>He stopped bull hon.</v>

946
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how to say this guy's name again.</v>

947
00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:28.220
<v Speaker 5>Me.</v>

948
00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.850
<v Speaker 5>I owe Vich me how you've,</v>

949
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:34.590
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember how to get bullion.</v>

950
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.640
<v Speaker 5>Mihailo Vich I do remember how to say homeboy's name.</v>

951
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:39.953
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

952
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.180
<v Speaker 5>then he stopped Anthony Hamilton,</v>

953
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.900
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

954
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.050
<v Speaker 5>by submission showing that he has submission skills as well.</v>

955
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.340
<v Speaker 5>And then of course just knocked out Andre Arlovski in his last fight.</v>

956
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.930
<v Speaker 5>It's a very interesting fight because the,</v>

957
00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:54.300
<v Speaker 5>the question is,</v>

958
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:59.900
<v Speaker 5>is in Ghana ready for a guy who's got the skills of Alistair over him?</v>

959
00:35:59.971 --> 00:36:00.804
<v Speaker 5>The skill,</v>

960
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.910
<v Speaker 5>the experience at the highest level,</v>

961
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.020
<v Speaker 5>the craftiness,</v>

962
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:09.140
<v Speaker 5>is he going to set traps and is Frances and gone going to be fall for those</v>

963
00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:10.710
<v Speaker 5>traps?</v>

964
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.880
<v Speaker 5>The other question is,</v>

965
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:17.300
<v Speaker 5>can all can Alster Overeem take a shot from in Ghana and Ghana has legitimate</v>

966
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.450
<v Speaker 5>absolute one punch knockout power,</v>

967
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:26.630
<v Speaker 5>extreme confidence and he's fresh and in his prime right now actually entering</v>

968
00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:28.674
<v Speaker 5>his prime,</v>

969
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:33.420
<v Speaker 5>I mean arguably he hasn't even reached its prime yet because in Ghana was one of</v>

970
00:36:33.421 --> 00:36:38.130
<v Speaker 5>those guys that had 31 years of age is near his physical prime,</v>

971
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:39.300
<v Speaker 5>but it's still learning.</v>

972
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:44.190
<v Speaker 5>He's still getting better at the sport and as he fights better and better</v>

973
00:36:44.191 --> 00:36:45.090
<v Speaker 5>competition,</v>

974
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:47.820
<v Speaker 5>you're going to see more of a skill shine.</v>

975
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:52.170
<v Speaker 5>You're going to see where the holes are in his game and you're going to see how</v>

976
00:36:52.171 --> 00:36:53.610
<v Speaker 5>he responds to adversity.</v>

977
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.820
<v Speaker 5>Hopefully we're going to get a chance to see all those things in his fight.</v>

978
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:57.660
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

979
00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.980
<v Speaker 5>if Overeem wins,</v>

980
00:36:58.981 --> 00:37:01.890
<v Speaker 5>there's a very good argument for him being next in line to fights.</v>

981
00:37:01.891 --> 00:37:02.760
<v Speaker 5>Deep Abo chip.</v>

982
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:05.730
<v Speaker 5>The real question about the heavyweight division,</v>

983
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.260
<v Speaker 5>the real question other than,</v>

984
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.153
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

985
00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:08.761
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

986
00:37:08.761 --> 00:37:10.200
<v Speaker 5>who's next for Steve Bay?</v>

987
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.380
<v Speaker 5>The real question is the health of Cain Velasquez.</v>

988
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:14.460
<v Speaker 5>Cain Velasquez,</v>

989
00:37:14.461 --> 00:37:15.181
<v Speaker 5>in my opinion,</v>

990
00:37:15.181 --> 00:37:18.390
<v Speaker 5>is without a doubt one of the greatest heavyweights of all time.</v>

991
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.733
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

992
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:23.130
<v Speaker 5>he's just a force of nature when he's in shape.</v>

993
00:37:23.131 --> 00:37:23.850
<v Speaker 5>When you,</v>

994
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:26.640
<v Speaker 5>when you see the Cain Velasquez that beat Ben Rothwell,</v>

995
00:37:26.641 --> 00:37:30.930
<v Speaker 5>when you see that Cain Velasquez that just stormed the division,</v>

996
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:35.490
<v Speaker 5>when you see him in the second and third fight with junior dos Santos,</v>

997
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.190
<v Speaker 5>that Cain Velasquez is a fucking monster.</v>

998
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:39.601
<v Speaker 5>The question is,</v>

999
00:37:39.601 --> 00:37:40.980
<v Speaker 5>after all the surgeries,</v>

1000
00:37:40.981 --> 00:37:41.910
<v Speaker 5>back surgery,</v>

1001
00:37:41.911 --> 00:37:42.750
<v Speaker 5>knee surgery,</v>

1002
00:37:42.751 --> 00:37:43.770
<v Speaker 5>shoulder surgery,</v>

1003
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.980
<v Speaker 5>can he come back and be that guy again?</v>

1004
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:47.963
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1005
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.171
<v Speaker 5>as a fan,</v>

1006
00:37:49.171 --> 00:37:50.610
<v Speaker 5>I most certainly hope we can,</v>

1007
00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:52.260
<v Speaker 5>but we're really not going to know.</v>

1008
00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:53.640
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1009
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.520
<v Speaker 5>another fight in the car that's very interesting is Henry.</v>

1010
00:37:56.521 --> 00:37:59.010
<v Speaker 5>So Hutto and Sergio Pettis.</v>

1011
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:04.140
<v Speaker 5>Sergio Pettis is the younger brother of showtime,</v>

1012
00:38:04.141 --> 00:38:04.531
<v Speaker 5>Pettis,</v>

1013
00:38:04.531 --> 00:38:05.281
<v Speaker 5>Anthony Pettis,</v>

1014
00:38:05.281 --> 00:38:07.950
<v Speaker 5>who was the former lightweight champion and Henry.</v>

1015
00:38:07.951 --> 00:38:11.130
<v Speaker 5>So Hutto of course is a former Olympic gold medalist,</v>

1016
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:13.710
<v Speaker 5>the number two ranked fly weight in the world.</v>

1017
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:18.890
<v Speaker 5>And Henry is coming off of an absolutely spectacular Kao of Wilson Hayes.</v>

1018
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:25.440
<v Speaker 5>I was blown away by him in that fight and that fight,</v>

1019
00:38:25.441 --> 00:38:27.900
<v Speaker 5>he looked like some sort of a karate master.</v>

1020
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:28.973
<v Speaker 5>I mean that was a,</v>

1021
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:29.850
<v Speaker 5>it was a very,</v>

1022
00:38:29.851 --> 00:38:30.990
<v Speaker 5>very interesting fight.</v>

1023
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.800
<v Speaker 5>Before that he lost a Benevidez and benefit is of course one of the most</v>

1024
00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:35.351
<v Speaker 5>experienced,</v>

1025
00:38:35.351 --> 00:38:38.170
<v Speaker 5>one of the best guys in the division and he lost it very,</v>

1026
00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:39.160
<v Speaker 5>very close fight.</v>

1027
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:43.300
<v Speaker 5>A fight where I've talked to his coaches afterwards and they were really pissed</v>

1028
00:38:43.301 --> 00:38:46.870
<v Speaker 5>off by the decision they thought so Hutto could have gotten the nod,</v>

1029
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:51.900
<v Speaker 5>but he rebounded and he rebounded versus Wilson Hayes and looked like a</v>

1030
00:38:52.811 --> 00:38:54.520
<v Speaker 5>completely different fighter.</v>

1031
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.850
<v Speaker 5>The thing that excites me about this fight,</v>

1032
00:38:57.970 --> 00:38:58.781
<v Speaker 5>it's two things.</v>

1033
00:38:58.781 --> 00:38:59.380
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

1034
00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.510
<v Speaker 5>the potential of Sergio Pettis.</v>

1035
00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.030
<v Speaker 5>Sergio Pettis is a young kid.</v>

1036
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:06.700
<v Speaker 5>He's one of the youngest guys in the division.</v>

1037
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:11.590
<v Speaker 5>He's the extremely talented younger brother of another extremely talented</v>

1038
00:39:11.591 --> 00:39:12.340
<v Speaker 5>fighter.</v>

1039
00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.100
<v Speaker 5>So he's had martial arts in his life.</v>

1040
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:15.880
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1041
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.800
<v Speaker 5>most of the time growing up,</v>

1042
00:39:17.801 --> 00:39:19.420
<v Speaker 5>he's 24 years old now.</v>

1043
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.380
<v Speaker 5>He trains under the Great Duke Roufus who in my opinion is one of the very best</v>

1044
00:39:23.381 --> 00:39:27.790
<v Speaker 5>guys in the division in terms of his ability to coach fighters.</v>

1045
00:39:27.791 --> 00:39:28.870
<v Speaker 5>He's fucking fantastic.</v>

1046
00:39:28.871 --> 00:39:30.970
<v Speaker 5>Doof not to division.</v>

1047
00:39:30.971 --> 00:39:31.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1048
00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:31.900
<v Speaker 5>I should say in,</v>

1049
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:32.733
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

1050
00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:33.673
<v Speaker 5>in the sport.</v>

1051
00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:34.180
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1052
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.250
<v Speaker 5>Duke Roufus has just an amazing striking coach.</v>

1053
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:38.950
<v Speaker 5>He's a former world Moy Thai champion himself,</v>

1054
00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:44.130
<v Speaker 5>outstanding kickboxer and extremely knowledgeable about both kickboxing and MMA</v>

1055
00:39:45.881 --> 00:39:49.960
<v Speaker 5>and one of the best guys in the world at training kickboxers for MMA.</v>

1056
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:50.531
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1057
00:39:50.531 --> 00:39:51.580
<v Speaker 5>he's just fantastic.</v>

1058
00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:55.270
<v Speaker 5>And what we've seen from young Sergio,</v>

1059
00:39:55.271 --> 00:39:56.920
<v Speaker 5>we saw him get,</v>

1060
00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:57.370
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1061
00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:58.570
<v Speaker 5>submitted by Alex,</v>

1062
00:39:58.571 --> 00:40:03.571
<v Speaker 5>get Sarah's early on in his career and Alex is,</v>

1063
00:40:03.641 --> 00:40:03.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1064
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.100
<v Speaker 5>just slicker and caught him on the ground.</v>

1065
00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:07.600
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1066
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:10.750
<v Speaker 5>and then we saw him lose again to Ryan Benoit.</v>

1067
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.480
<v Speaker 5>I think that these losses,</v>

1068
00:40:13.481 --> 00:40:14.770
<v Speaker 5>especially for a young fighter,</v>

1069
00:40:14.771 --> 00:40:16.150
<v Speaker 5>are absolutely critical.</v>

1070
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:20.530
<v Speaker 5>I think you find out what you're really made of you and you see what you need to</v>

1071
00:40:20.531 --> 00:40:21.281
<v Speaker 5>improve upon.</v>

1072
00:40:21.281 --> 00:40:24.130
<v Speaker 5>And in fighting tough guys early on,</v>

1073
00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:26.170
<v Speaker 5>like Alex Caceres,</v>

1074
00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.550
<v Speaker 5>like Ryan Benoit,</v>

1075
00:40:27.551 --> 00:40:28.384
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1076
00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:32.170
<v Speaker 5>and we're talking about two years ago he fought Benoit.</v>

1077
00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.210
<v Speaker 5>He was 21 years old then,</v>

1078
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.310
<v Speaker 5>so or 22 years old,</v>

1079
00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:37.144
<v Speaker 5>he's 24 now.</v>

1080
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.800
<v Speaker 5>So He's a really young kid,</v>

1081
00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:39.521
<v Speaker 5>still learning,</v>

1082
00:40:39.521 --> 00:40:42.260
<v Speaker 5>still growing on the job and uh,</v>

1083
00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.630
<v Speaker 5>has looked fantastic.</v>

1084
00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:48.730
<v Speaker 5>And his last few fights looked really good against John Moraga and looked even</v>

1085
00:40:48.731 --> 00:40:51.760
<v Speaker 5>better against Brandon Marino in his last fight,</v>

1086
00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:53.950
<v Speaker 5>which was a five round,</v>

1087
00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.660
<v Speaker 5>unanimous decision victory.</v>

1088
00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:58.330
<v Speaker 5>So this is my opinion,</v>

1089
00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.900
<v Speaker 5>is going to be the toughest fight of his career because Henry,</v>

1090
00:41:01.901 --> 00:41:06.901
<v Speaker 5>so Hutto just has that Olympic gold medal winner mindset,</v>

1091
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:13.020
<v Speaker 5>the mindset of a galaxy Hutto I mean this guy is focused on being a champion 24</v>

1092
00:41:14.231 --> 00:41:15.160
<v Speaker 5>hours a day.</v>

1093
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:19.570
<v Speaker 5>And if you look at the way he fought against Wilson Hayes,</v>

1094
00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:20.670
<v Speaker 5>I mean if,</v>

1095
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:25.670
<v Speaker 5>if that's indicative of the kind of improvement that this guy can make and</v>

1096
00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:27.220
<v Speaker 5>carrying Gibbons who,</v>

1097
00:41:27.221 --> 00:41:27.850
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1098
00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:28.211
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

1099
00:41:28.211 --> 00:41:28.570
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1100
00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:31.210
<v Speaker 5>another fucking phenomenal Muay Thai coach,</v>

1101
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:36.350
<v Speaker 5>he told me that this kid is just a sponge and just can learn so fast that a</v>

1102
00:41:36.351 --> 00:41:37.250
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous way.</v>

1103
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:42.430
<v Speaker 5>And I think you looking at athletic prowess in Henry pseudo,</v>

1104
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.410
<v Speaker 5>but I think maybe perhaps more important than that,</v>

1105
00:41:45.411 --> 00:41:46.610
<v Speaker 5>you're looking at his mind.</v>

1106
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:51.790
<v Speaker 5>His mind is just ultra sharp and focused and determined and he's just got that</v>

1107
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:54.860
<v Speaker 5>championship mindset.</v>

1108
00:41:54.861 --> 00:41:58.220
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's why he is an Olympic gold medalist and a wrestling.</v>

1109
00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.630
<v Speaker 5>So he's got unparalleled wrestling skill in the division.</v>

1110
00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:03.950
<v Speaker 5>And then on top of that,</v>

1111
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.540
<v Speaker 5>if you look at the Wilson Hayes fight,</v>

1112
00:42:05.541 --> 00:42:08.540
<v Speaker 5>you look at radical improvements in his striking and movement.</v>

1113
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:13.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean he looked like a combination of a Prime Leo Machida and Conor Mcgregor</v>

1114
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.630
<v Speaker 5>versus with his movement against Wilson Hayes.</v>

1115
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.540
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of guys are realizing that karate style,</v>

1116
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.570
<v Speaker 5>if you have all those other bases covered,</v>

1117
00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.190
<v Speaker 5>if you have great wrestling,</v>

1118
00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:26.330
<v Speaker 5>if you have submissions,</v>

1119
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.710
<v Speaker 5>good takedown defense and good boxing skills as well as moy,</v>

1120
00:42:29.711 --> 00:42:30.110
<v Speaker 5>Tai,</v>

1121
00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:30.830
<v Speaker 5>everything else,</v>

1122
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:32.510
<v Speaker 5>that karate stance,</v>

1123
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:36.770
<v Speaker 5>that sideways stance that we see employed all the time by Wonderboy Thompson</v>

1124
00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:37.760
<v Speaker 5>that we see.</v>

1125
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.593
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1126
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:39.853
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1127
00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:40.541
<v Speaker 5>we've seen a,</v>

1128
00:42:40.541 --> 00:42:41.720
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of different fighters.</v>

1129
00:42:41.721 --> 00:42:42.141
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>

1130
00:42:42.141 --> 00:42:42.831
<v Speaker 5>Leo Machida,</v>

1131
00:42:42.831 --> 00:42:46.160
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of different fighters use that stance inside the octagon.</v>

1132
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:47.653
<v Speaker 5>Conor McGregor,</v>

1133
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.570
<v Speaker 5>it's a very difficult stance to deal with.</v>

1134
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:50.961
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

1135
00:42:50.961 --> 00:42:53.180
<v Speaker 5>if you're good at it and if you're good at that movement,</v>

1136
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:55.490
<v Speaker 5>that in and out side to side movement,</v>

1137
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.720
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1138
00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:59.330
<v Speaker 5>Michael Venom page has a very unusual take on that,</v>

1139
00:42:59.360 --> 00:42:59.930
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1140
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:00.880
<v Speaker 5>fighting and Bella tore.</v>

1141
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:02.210
<v Speaker 5>He likes to fight like that too.</v>

1142
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:05.420
<v Speaker 5>And of course he's a former point fighting champion.</v>

1143
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.510
<v Speaker 5>That style is fucking hard to deal with.</v>

1144
00:43:08.511 --> 00:43:12.290
<v Speaker 5>It's really hard for guys to judge and if you're dealing with a guy like,</v>

1145
00:43:12.291 --> 00:43:17.210
<v Speaker 5>so Huda whose lightning fast on top of that and starts moving like that with</v>

1146
00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:20.720
<v Speaker 5>those worldclass wrestling skills with excellent striking,</v>

1147
00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:21.380
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1148
00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:21.621
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1149
00:43:21.621 --> 00:43:23.660
<v Speaker 5>classic striking boxing and kickboxing,</v>

1150
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.550
<v Speaker 5>very difficult to deal with.</v>

1151
00:43:25.551 --> 00:43:29.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm very interested to see what style he takes a,</v>

1152
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:33.020
<v Speaker 5>or how he approaches this fight with Sergio Pettis.</v>

1153
00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:36.140
<v Speaker 5>He's quite a bit older than Sergio being 30.</v>

1154
00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.250
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1155
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.690
<v Speaker 5>that's a really interesting fight.</v>

1156
00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm very curious.</v>

1157
00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:41.120
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1158
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.100
<v Speaker 5>I just do not know how that one's going to play out.</v>

1159
00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:45.530
<v Speaker 5>One fight that I don't know how to,</v>

1160
00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:46.760
<v Speaker 5>it's going to play out,</v>

1161
00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:51.940
<v Speaker 5>but I'm fucking beyond pumped for it is Eddie Alvarez and just engage you just</v>

1162
00:43:53.571 --> 00:43:54.051
<v Speaker 5>engage.</v>

1163
00:43:54.051 --> 00:43:56.820
<v Speaker 5>He is a fucking savage</v>

1164
00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.440
<v Speaker 5>and so's Eddie Alvarez.</v>

1165
00:44:00.441 --> 00:44:04.670
<v Speaker 5>Eddie Alvarez is a beast and I think a lot of people are looking past Alvarez.</v>

1166
00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:10.180
<v Speaker 5>Alvarez had just come off of that brutal knockout loss,</v>

1167
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:12.283
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1168
00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:17.380
<v Speaker 5>kind of a humiliating knockout loss to Conor McGregor.</v>

1169
00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:22.760
<v Speaker 5>And then after that he is involved in the,</v>

1170
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:24.230
<v Speaker 5>the no contest,</v>

1171
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:25.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1172
00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:26.330
<v Speaker 5>versus um,</v>

1173
00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:27.770
<v Speaker 5>Dustin poor yet.</v>

1174
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.480
<v Speaker 5>I believe that was an eye poke.</v>

1175
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:30.870
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1176
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 5>that is,</v>

1177
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to remember how that fight went down,</v>

1178
00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:35.904
<v Speaker 5>but I do not,</v>

1179
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.860
<v Speaker 5>I feel like someone got poked in the eye.</v>

1180
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:39.510
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1181
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.310
<v Speaker 5>either way it's a no contest.</v>

1182
00:44:41.311 --> 00:44:46.311
<v Speaker 5>So that obviously doesn't move him up the ladder any and he's got to regroup.</v>

1183
00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:50.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1184
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:51.220
<v Speaker 5>no contest.</v>

1185
00:44:51.221 --> 00:44:52.054
<v Speaker 5>Here it is.</v>

1186
00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:54.873
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1187
00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:59.083
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1188
00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:00.200
<v Speaker 5>This was a,</v>

1189
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:00.621
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1190
00:45:00.621 --> 00:45:01.760
<v Speaker 5>now I remember what it was.</v>

1191
00:45:01.761 --> 00:45:02.810
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't an eye poke.</v>

1192
00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:08.050
<v Speaker 5>It was a knee to a downed opponent and it was a fucking phenomenal fight while</v>

1193
00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:12.560
<v Speaker 5>it played out against Dustin Poirier.</v>

1194
00:45:12.561 --> 00:45:12.980
<v Speaker 5>Yay.</v>

1195
00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:14.570
<v Speaker 5>They were going back and forth.</v>

1196
00:45:14.571 --> 00:45:14.781
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1197
00:45:14.781 --> 00:45:19.781
<v Speaker 5>I remember the fight and poor ea had Alverez in some deep trouble and Alvarez</v>

1198
00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.430
<v Speaker 5>rebounded.</v>

1199
00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:26.120
<v Speaker 5>And Alvarez I believe,</v>

1200
00:45:26.121 --> 00:45:30.620
<v Speaker 5>hit Dustin employee Aa with a knee while he was down.</v>

1201
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:33.323
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1202
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.030
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what happened.</v>

1203
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.780
<v Speaker 4>And interesting.</v>

1204
00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:43.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1205
00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:44.590
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

1206
00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:45.490
<v Speaker 5>this is what happened.</v>

1207
00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:46.031
<v Speaker 5>Pour.</v>

1208
00:45:46.031 --> 00:45:46.600
<v Speaker 5>Yay.</v>

1209
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.433
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1210
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:50.700
<v Speaker 5>Alvarez,</v>

1211
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:52.110
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1212
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:54.120
<v Speaker 5>Herb Dean was Safat defending it,</v>

1213
00:45:54.121 --> 00:45:56.310
<v Speaker 5>saying that Alvarez didn't intentionally need pour.</v>

1214
00:45:56.311 --> 00:45:56.730
<v Speaker 5>Yay.</v>

1215
00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:57.361
<v Speaker 5>And if I remember,</v>

1216
00:45:57.361 --> 00:46:00.240
<v Speaker 5>the fight is a crazy war.</v>

1217
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:00.721
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1218
00:46:00.721 --> 00:46:02.130
<v Speaker 5>Alvarez had been rocked.</v>

1219
00:46:02.131 --> 00:46:03.060
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] had been,</v>

1220
00:46:03.061 --> 00:46:06.410
<v Speaker 5>Brock poet was bloodied and um,</v>

1221
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:10.020
<v Speaker 5>Alvarez hit him with an unintentional knee,</v>

1222
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.100
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1223
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:15.390
<v Speaker 5>that could have resulted in a disqualification when for poor.</v>

1224
00:46:15.391 --> 00:46:16.224
<v Speaker 5>Yay.</v>

1225
00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:18.960
<v Speaker 5>And Paula was saying that he looked at it as a win,</v>

1226
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:19.861
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

1227
00:46:19.861 --> 00:46:20.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1228
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:20.903
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

1229
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.393
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1230
00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.680
<v Speaker 5>so anyway,</v>

1231
00:46:25.681 --> 00:46:29.520
<v Speaker 5>pull a rebounded from that fight obviously,</v>

1232
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:30.120
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

1233
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:35.120
<v Speaker 5>stopped Anthony Pettis in his last fight so that the division is just crazy in</v>

1234
00:46:36.631 --> 00:46:37.080
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

1235
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.670
<v Speaker 5>Unbelievably hot right now.</v>

1236
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:39.630
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1237
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:42.420
<v Speaker 5>and everybody waiting to see what the fuck happens with Conor McGregor</v>

1238
00:46:42.421 --> 00:46:42.961
<v Speaker 5>rebounding.</v>

1239
00:46:42.961 --> 00:46:46.410
<v Speaker 5>But Eddie Alvarez with a no contest.</v>

1240
00:46:46.411 --> 00:46:47.280
<v Speaker 5>And before that,</v>

1241
00:46:47.281 --> 00:46:51.030
<v Speaker 5>the Kale lost econom McGregor desperately needs a win.</v>

1242
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:56.160
<v Speaker 5>And he's coming in there against one of the most fucking savage guys in the</v>

1243
00:46:56.161 --> 00:46:56.994
<v Speaker 5>division.</v>

1244
00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:57.870
<v Speaker 5>Just engaging,</v>

1245
00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:01.140
<v Speaker 5>showed in that Michael Johnson fight what he's made of and a lot of people were</v>

1246
00:47:01.141 --> 00:47:03.270
<v Speaker 5>very excited to see him inside the octagon.</v>

1247
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:06.660
<v Speaker 5>He had been fighting in the world series of fighting and looking like an</v>

1248
00:47:06.661 --> 00:47:07.890
<v Speaker 5>absolute monster,</v>

1249
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:13.580
<v Speaker 5>but against what a lot of people thought was just not the same caliber of</v>

1250
00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:16.380
<v Speaker 5>competition as the UFC offered.</v>

1251
00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:21.450
<v Speaker 5>And so they wanted to see what would happen if he fought a real world class</v>

1252
00:47:21.451 --> 00:47:21.960
<v Speaker 5>fighter.</v>

1253
00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:24.150
<v Speaker 5>And what we saw in the Michael Johnson fight,</v>

1254
00:47:24.151 --> 00:47:25.040
<v Speaker 5>it's adjusting gauge.</v>

1255
00:47:25.041 --> 00:47:25.874
<v Speaker 5>He who fights,</v>

1256
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.240
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1257
00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to say reckless,</v>

1258
00:47:28.501 --> 00:47:32.590
<v Speaker 5>but he puts himself in danger and it's one of the things that makes him so</v>

1259
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:33.010
<v Speaker 5>exciting.</v>

1260
00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:34.780
<v Speaker 5>He forces his will on people.</v>

1261
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:38.160
<v Speaker 5>He's a ferocious striker and a,</v>

1262
00:47:38.161 --> 00:47:39.790
<v Speaker 5>an excellent wrestlers as well,</v>

1263
00:47:39.791 --> 00:47:42.790
<v Speaker 5>and just fucking puts it on fighters.</v>

1264
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.860
<v Speaker 5>He tests there will,</v>

1265
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:47.530
<v Speaker 5>he puts tremendous pressure on fighters.</v>

1266
00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:48.930
<v Speaker 5>And the,</v>

1267
00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:53.920
<v Speaker 5>the fight with Michael Johnson was just a pleasure to watch,</v>

1268
00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:57.220
<v Speaker 5>just so much fun and so fucking crazy.</v>

1269
00:47:57.221 --> 00:47:59.320
<v Speaker 5>There was so much chaos in that fight.</v>

1270
00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:04.540
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of people were introduced to just engage you from that fight.</v>

1271
00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:08.110
<v Speaker 5>The hardcore fans had known him already from the world series of fighting and</v>

1272
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:10.030
<v Speaker 5>had heard about him through the Internet.</v>

1273
00:48:10.031 --> 00:48:12.830
<v Speaker 5>But the UFC fans and uh,</v>

1274
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:14.890
<v Speaker 5>the people that were watching that night,</v>

1275
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:18.410
<v Speaker 5>they really got a chance to be treated too.</v>

1276
00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:23.680
<v Speaker 5>Does the kind of chaotic fight that is really going to bring like a of the</v>

1277
00:48:25.001 --> 00:48:29.200
<v Speaker 5>casual fan when they see a guy like just engaging fight.</v>

1278
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:32.830
<v Speaker 5>It's really gonna make you a fan of this kid.</v>

1279
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:34.600
<v Speaker 5>Just his style is just,</v>

1280
00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.370
<v Speaker 5>there's very few guys,</v>

1281
00:48:36.371 --> 00:48:37.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean other than,</v>

1282
00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean Matt Brown who I talked about before,</v>

1283
00:48:40.181 --> 00:48:44.560
<v Speaker 5>but even Matt Brown is capable of winning so many different ways.</v>

1284
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:49.420
<v Speaker 5>Whereas Gagey he's gonna probably try to knock you out or get,</v>

1285
00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:49.721
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1286
00:48:49.721 --> 00:48:52.450
<v Speaker 5>he's even said himself that he might get knocked out.</v>

1287
00:48:52.451 --> 00:48:54.130
<v Speaker 5>You're probably going to see me get knocked out.</v>

1288
00:48:54.131 --> 00:48:54.964
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

1289
00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:55.271
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1290
00:48:55.271 --> 00:48:57.880
<v Speaker 5>over the next few years he's got that mindset,</v>

1291
00:48:57.881 --> 00:49:00.250
<v Speaker 5>this kill or be killed mindset.</v>

1292
00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:01.001
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1293
00:49:01.001 --> 00:49:01.420
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1294
00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:05.800
<v Speaker 5>it's just absolutely fascinating to see this kid compete inside the octagon</v>

1295
00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:10.860
<v Speaker 5>because he's so fucking crazy because he's such a fucking animal inside the</v>

1296
00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:11.914
<v Speaker 5>octagon.</v>

1297
00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:13.750
<v Speaker 5>He just got this,</v>

1298
00:49:13.751 --> 00:49:14.584
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1299
00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:18.850
<v Speaker 5>undeniable killer instinct and indomitable spirit.</v>

1300
00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:22.420
<v Speaker 5>And there's levels to this game.</v>

1301
00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:23.980
<v Speaker 5>There's levels physically,</v>

1302
00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:26.020
<v Speaker 5>and he's at a very high level physically,</v>

1303
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:28.150
<v Speaker 5>but there's also levels mentally.</v>

1304
00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:31.210
<v Speaker 5>And that's what excites me about Justice Gagey is,</v>

1305
00:49:31.211 --> 00:49:31.871
<v Speaker 5>is the,</v>

1306
00:49:31.871 --> 00:49:33.010
<v Speaker 5>the mental level.</v>

1307
00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:38.440
<v Speaker 5>He just has zero quit in him and he's 100% ferocious.</v>

1308
00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:43.570
<v Speaker 5>So him fighting a fucking animal like Eddie Alvarez,</v>

1309
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.780
<v Speaker 5>that's just a recipe for a good time.</v>

1310
00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:50.560
<v Speaker 5>And we're going to get to see that and we're going to get to see that next</v>

1311
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.120
<v Speaker 5>Saturday night live on paper view.</v>

1312
00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.100
<v Speaker 5>Woo.</v>

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:58.930
<v Speaker 5>So how long have you been doing this here for nine minutes.</v>

1314

1320
00:50:04.931 --> 00:50:05.760
<v Speaker 5>That's a big fight.</v>

1321
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.460

1325
00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:12.670
<v Speaker 5>Paul Felder continues to impress.</v>

1326
00:50:12.671 --> 00:50:13.360
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what,</v>

1327
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.370
<v Speaker 5>Paul Felder's a fucking phenomenal,</v>

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:43.310
<v Speaker 5>And he's fighting Charles all of Vera Saturday night.</v>

1343
00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:43.940
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1344
00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:48.650
<v Speaker 5>Charles all Avera is a guy who has had mixed success inside the octagon and his</v>

1345
00:50:48.651 --> 00:50:49.250
<v Speaker 5>best.</v>

1346
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:54.250
<v Speaker 5>He's been incredible and he shows a great range of very technical striking and</v>

1347
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:56.001
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

1348
00:50:56.001 --> 00:50:57.770
<v Speaker 5>very solid Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>

1349
00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:01.460
<v Speaker 5>but he's had some tough losses.</v>

1350
00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:01.631
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

1351

<v Speaker 5>the Kale lost a cub.</v>

1352
00:51:02.931 --> 00:51:03.860
<v Speaker 5>Swanson,</v>

1353
00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:04.890
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1354
00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:07.170
<v Speaker 5>is he burst onto the scene with a,</v>

1355
00:51:07.171 --> 00:51:08.390
<v Speaker 5>an amazing victory,</v>

1356
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.273
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1357
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:13.371
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

1358
00:51:13.371 --> 00:51:14.390
<v Speaker 5>way back in the day.</v>

1359
00:51:14.391 --> 00:51:14.571
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

1360
00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:15.770
<v Speaker 5>this is not even Efrain.</v>

1361
00:51:15.771 --> 00:51:19.220
<v Speaker 5>Escudero was his second fight inside of the octagon actually,</v>

1362
00:51:19.221 --> 00:51:21.650
<v Speaker 5>and he got him by standing rear naked choke.</v>

1363
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:25.790
<v Speaker 5>That was a big fight because Efrain Escudero had won the ultimate fighter and it</v>

1364
00:51:25.791 --> 00:51:26.121
<v Speaker 5>was just,</v>

1365
00:51:26.121 --> 00:51:27.500
<v Speaker 5>it was a big victory for him.</v>

1366
00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:31.130
<v Speaker 5>And he went down,</v>

1367
00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.560
<v Speaker 5>he lost to cowboy Serone.</v>

1368
00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:34.550
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1369
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:38.370
<v Speaker 5>he got a coyote and the first round he,</v>

1370
00:51:38.371 --> 00:51:38.570
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1371
00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:39.770
<v Speaker 5>lost to Jim Miller.</v>

1372
00:51:39.771 --> 00:51:40.970
<v Speaker 5>He got submitted.</v>

1373
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:43.160
<v Speaker 5>And then the cub Swanson Kao,</v>

1374
00:51:43.161 --> 00:51:46.820
<v Speaker 5>he got beat up by Frankie Edgar in a very fun fight.</v>

1375
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.670
<v Speaker 5>Three Round New Anna you unanimous decision.</v>

1376
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:55.030
<v Speaker 5>Then a Max Holloway put it on him and stopped him in the first round.</v>

1377
00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:58.310
<v Speaker 5>Then Anthony Pettis submitted him.</v>

1378
00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:01.010
<v Speaker 5>So he's had some,</v>

1379
00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:02.570
<v Speaker 5>some ups and downs.</v>

1380
00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:03.413
<v Speaker 5>Ricardo Lamas,</v>

1381
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:03.980
<v Speaker 5>Kod,</v>

1382
00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:04.813
<v Speaker 5>em,</v>

1383
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:05.210
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1384
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.690
<v Speaker 5>excuse me.</v>

1385
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:08.090
<v Speaker 5>Ricardo Lamas finished in by submission in the second round,</v>

1386
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.770
<v Speaker 5>so he beat,</v>

1387
00:52:09.771 --> 00:52:13.610
<v Speaker 5>we'll Brooks by submission in the first round of his last fight and got back on</v>

1388
00:52:13.611 --> 00:52:14.001
<v Speaker 5>track.</v>

1389
00:52:14.001 --> 00:52:16.790
<v Speaker 5>Looked excellent in that fight and fought that fight.</v>

1390
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.830
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1391
00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:18.663
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>

1392
00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.110
<v Speaker 5>it was a real do or die fight for him against,</v>

1393
00:52:21.111 --> 00:52:23.870
<v Speaker 5>we'll Brooks a guy who was coming over from Bella tour,</v>

1394
00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:28.190
<v Speaker 5>a guy who was very talented and a Oliveira wound up submitting him.</v>

1395
00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:32.150
<v Speaker 5>There was a big victory for him and in my opinion,</v>

1396
00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:36.440
<v Speaker 5>this is one of the most dangerous fights for him right now at this stage of his</v>

1397
00:52:36.441 --> 00:52:36.771
<v Speaker 5>career.</v>

1398
00:52:36.771 --> 00:52:39.200
<v Speaker 5>Because Paul Felder is a fucking killer.</v>

1399
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:40.550
<v Speaker 5>He's an animal.</v>

1400
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:41.391
<v Speaker 5>He's very,</v>

1401
00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:42.830
<v Speaker 5>very strong physically.</v>

1402
00:52:42.831 --> 00:52:45.110
<v Speaker 5>He's a big 155 pound doors.</v>

1403
00:52:45.111 --> 00:52:45.321
<v Speaker 5>All.</v>

1404
00:52:45.321 --> 00:52:48.050
<v Speaker 5>Avera is a smaller 155 pounder.</v>

1405
00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.210
<v Speaker 5>I guy was fought at one 45 before,</v>

1406
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:52.640
<v Speaker 5>but just really had a hard time making that weight.</v>

1407
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:54.103
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1408
00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:55.010
<v Speaker 5>fell.</v>

1409
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:58.850
<v Speaker 5>Just going to have a power and strength advantage and all Avera is going to have</v>

1410
00:52:58.851 --> 00:53:00.860
<v Speaker 5>to be crafty and in my opinion,</v>

1411
00:53:00.861 --> 00:53:03.260
<v Speaker 5>his best way to win this fight is to get this fight to the ground.</v>

1412
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:06.080
<v Speaker 5>And that's going to be a tall order,</v>

1413
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:07.100
<v Speaker 5>a very tall order.</v>

1414
00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:07.880
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1415
00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:11.210
<v Speaker 5>Felder's just a very aggressive,</v>

1416
00:53:11.211 --> 00:53:16.211
<v Speaker 5>very durable and extremely aggressive guy and 155 pounds.</v>

1417
00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:18.650
<v Speaker 5>Can I say aggressive one more time.</v>

1418
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:19.580
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1419
00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.650
<v Speaker 5>I really loved his fight against,</v>

1420
00:53:21.651 --> 00:53:22.484
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1421
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:23.570
<v Speaker 5>well he's got,</v>

1422
00:53:23.571 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 5>had some amazing fights inside the octagon,</v>

1423
00:53:26.041 --> 00:53:28.110
<v Speaker 5>but what would I liked?</v>

1424
00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:30.360
<v Speaker 5>I liked his fights against,</v>

1425
00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:35.370
<v Speaker 5>I like his fight against Barboza because the Barboza fight showed him against</v>

1426
00:53:35.371 --> 00:53:39.450
<v Speaker 5>one of the very best strikers in the division and he'd got out struck.</v>

1427
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.010
<v Speaker 5>He lost that fight,</v>

1428
00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:45.360
<v Speaker 5>but he was in it every second of the fight and he was trying to win up until the</v>

1429
00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:46.194
<v Speaker 5>very end.</v>

1430
00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:47.363
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1431
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:49.890
<v Speaker 5>he's had some ups and downs inside the octagon,</v>

1432
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:51.960
<v Speaker 5>but he's won two in a row,</v>

1433
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:55.830
<v Speaker 5>both by knock out both in the first round and,</v>

1434
00:53:55.831 --> 00:53:56.664
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1435
00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:01.820
<v Speaker 5>the Barboza fight and the Ross Pearson fight or to decision losses that he got a</v>

1436
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:03.810
<v Speaker 5>split decision against Ross Pearson.</v>

1437
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:08.560
<v Speaker 5>He beat Danny Castillo and a spectacular spinning back fist knock out,</v>

1438
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:09.450
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1439
00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:11.490
<v Speaker 5>Jason's saga before that.</v>

1440
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:12.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1441
00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:17.330
<v Speaker 5>and the Barboza fight I think was just a good example of like where this guy's</v>

1442
00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:24.090
<v Speaker 5>hard is that fought against one of the best and fastest strikers in the division</v>

1443
00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:25.200
<v Speaker 5>and was in it to the end.</v>

1444
00:54:25.201 --> 00:54:29.640
<v Speaker 5>It was a real learning experience for him and that was a also fight of the</v>

1445
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.300
<v Speaker 5>night.</v>

1446
00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:35.010
<v Speaker 5>So I think Felder at this stage of his career is really coming into his own.</v>

1447
00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:36.600
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's in his prime yet.</v>

1448
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:37.231
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1449
00:54:37.231 --> 00:54:38.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1450
00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.480
<v Speaker 5>at 33 years of age,</v>

1451
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:41.250
<v Speaker 5>we're starting to see the very best of him.</v>

1452
00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:41.850
<v Speaker 5>And he's,</v>

1453
00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:43.590
<v Speaker 5>he's got an incredibly bright future,</v>

1454
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.430
<v Speaker 5>but also you gotta realize that 33 years of age,</v>

1455
00:54:46.431 --> 00:54:47.730
<v Speaker 5>she kind of got to get after it.</v>

1456
00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:48.564
<v Speaker 5>Right now.</v>

1457
00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:51.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is the time for him and,</v>

1458
00:54:51.211 --> 00:54:52.020
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1459
00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:57.020
<v Speaker 5>for Olivera Oliver has got to capitalize on that victory that he just had over.</v>

1460
00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:00.780
<v Speaker 5>We'll Brooks and you know,</v>

1461
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:04.290
<v Speaker 5>he's a little bit younger at 28 and still got massive potential and an</v>

1462
00:55:04.291 --> 00:55:08.070
<v Speaker 5>incredible amount of experience for a guy who's a 28 years old.</v>

1463
00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.380
<v Speaker 5>So this fucking card is just stacked.</v>

1464
00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:12.690
<v Speaker 5>This card is stack from top to bottom.</v>

1465
00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:13.741
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1466
00:55:13.741 --> 00:55:18.741
<v Speaker 5>you've got 'em cowboy Oliveira versus Yancey Madeiros is on that fight and David</v>

1467
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:21.210
<v Speaker 5>Tamer is on that fight,</v>

1468
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:24.660
<v Speaker 5>the fight card as well against drug car clothes.</v>

1469
00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:27.000
<v Speaker 5>Now that's a fucking sleeper.</v>

1470
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:29.520
<v Speaker 5>That's the big sleep or fight their cause.</v>

1471
00:55:29.521 --> 00:55:33.720
<v Speaker 5>David Tamer is a fucking vicious Stryker,</v>

1472
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.801
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1473
00:55:34.801 --> 00:55:39.801
<v Speaker 5>real world class striker and he's only 28 years old.</v>

1474
00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:44.880
<v Speaker 5>And David Tamer really let everybody know what the fuck is up when he fought</v>

1475
00:55:44.881 --> 00:55:45.780
<v Speaker 5>Landover Nada.</v>

1476
00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:48.600
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people had no idea who he was,</v>

1477
00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:49.030
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1478
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:50.010
<v Speaker 5>up until that fight,</v>

1479
00:55:50.011 --> 00:55:51.210
<v Speaker 5>even though he had one,</v>

1480
00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:54.660
<v Speaker 5>two fights in a row by Kao in the Octagon.</v>

1481
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.280
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1482
00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:01.280
<v Speaker 5>when you got to see that kid compete a against a really talented striker like</v>

1483
00:56:02.491 --> 00:56:05.460
<v Speaker 5>land Vanatta and just out strike him every step of the way,</v>

1484
00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:07.380
<v Speaker 5>you really got to see how good he is.</v>

1485
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:08.371
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>

1486
00:56:08.371 --> 00:56:09.450
<v Speaker 5>at 28 years of age,</v>

1487
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we've seen the best of him yet.</v>

1488
00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:12.310
<v Speaker 5>I think he is a,</v>

1489
00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:14.490
<v Speaker 5>he has just got a massive,</v>

1490
00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:18.290
<v Speaker 5>massive amount of potential and that's the fight that I think is the big sleep</v>

1491
00:56:18.291 --> 00:56:21.210
<v Speaker 5>or fight on this car that a lot of people are just,</v>

1492
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:21.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1493
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.010
<v Speaker 5>not quite aware of it.</v>

1494
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:28.170
<v Speaker 5>And the guys fighting Dzhokhar close eight to know with one draw and very</v>

1495
00:56:29.231 --> 00:56:31.090
<v Speaker 5>fucking dangerous fighter as well.</v>

1496
00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:31.601
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1497
00:56:31.601 --> 00:56:34.510
<v Speaker 5>he's coming from two victories in a row,</v>

1498
00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:35.403
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1499
00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.760
<v Speaker 5>in the UFC and uh,</v>

1500
00:56:37.761 --> 00:56:38.890
<v Speaker 5>this will be his,</v>

1501
00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.740
<v Speaker 5>probably his most dangerous fight against Tamer.</v>

1502
00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:44.200
<v Speaker 5>Tamer is just a wild,</v>

1503
00:56:44.201 --> 00:56:49.201
<v Speaker 5>fast dynamic striker with legit worldclass kickboxing Muay Thai skills.</v>

1504
00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:51.723
<v Speaker 5>Very,</v>

1505
00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.020
<v Speaker 5>very fun card.</v>

1506
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.700
<v Speaker 5>So that's going to be next Saturday night.</v>

1507
00:56:54.701 --> 00:56:55.061
<v Speaker 5>Also.</v>

1508
00:56:55.061 --> 00:56:57.550
<v Speaker 5>Teesha Torres is going to be fighting the karate.</v>

1509
00:56:57.551 --> 00:56:58.384
<v Speaker 5>Heidi,</v>

1510
00:56:58.450 --> 00:56:59.283
<v Speaker 5>Heidi,</v>

1511
00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:01.900
<v Speaker 5>karate hottie Michelle Waterson.</v>

1512
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:04.090
<v Speaker 5>That should be a fun fight as well.</v>

1513
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:05.140
<v Speaker 5>Teesha Torres,</v>

1514
00:57:05.141 --> 00:57:05.621
<v Speaker 5>who's a,</v>

1515
00:57:05.621 --> 00:57:08.830
<v Speaker 5>an outstanding striker and Michelle Waterson who,</v>

1516
00:57:08.831 --> 00:57:09.640
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1517
00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.600
<v Speaker 5>employs a lot of that karate styles,</v>

1518
00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:14.170
<v Speaker 5>whether we're talking about that side where it's sideways stance,</v>

1519
00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.170
<v Speaker 5>she's got good kickboxing skills as well.</v>

1520
00:57:17.171 --> 00:57:19.620
<v Speaker 5>Good submission skills and uh,</v>

1521
00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:22.750
<v Speaker 5>Teesha Torres is going to most likely try to keep this fight on the feet.</v>

1522
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:24.130
<v Speaker 5>There should be a lot of fun.</v>

1523
00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:24.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1525
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:27.910
<v Speaker 5>Michelle lost her last fight to rose,</v>

1526
00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:28.744
<v Speaker 5>Nama Eunice,</v>

1527
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:29.171
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

00:57:29.171 --> 00:57:29.340
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1529
00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:33.010
<v Speaker 5>she'd be Paige vanzant by submission before that in a a very,</v>

1530
00:57:33.011 --> 00:57:34.090
<v Speaker 5>very impressive fight.</v>

1531

<v Speaker 5>Angela McGauna,</v>

1533
00:57:36.221 --> 00:57:39.790
<v Speaker 5>she'd beat her by submission before that and Jessica Pinay,</v>

1534
00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:41.560
<v Speaker 5>she beat her in Invicta,</v>

<v Speaker 5>by decision before that.</v>

1537
00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:44.650
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1538

00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:51.040
<v Speaker 5>she's got a lot of hype behind her one because of she's got a unique style.</v>

1541
00:57:51.041 --> 00:57:53.410
<v Speaker 5>She's fighting out of Jackson's,</v>

<v Speaker 5>and she's also a very beautiful young lady.</v>

1546
00:57:58.181 --> 00:57:59.440
<v Speaker 5>And of course people like that.</v>

1547

1551
00:58:04.741 --> 00:58:05.710
<v Speaker 5>It should be a lot of fun.</v>

1552
00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:06.461
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>

<v Speaker 5>That mother fucker is wild.</v>

1559
00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:13.800
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1560
00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.180

1561
00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:18.490
<v Speaker 5>Alvarez versus gauge,</v>

1562

1563
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.810
<v Speaker 5>do not get popcorn while that fight is going on.</v>

1564
00:58:23.110 --> 00:58:24.190
<v Speaker 5>As long as it lasts,</v>

1565
00:58:24.191 --> 00:58:26.050
<v Speaker 5>I fight will be chaos.</v>

1566
00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:26.830
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1567
00:58:26.830 --> 00:58:27.491
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

1568
00:58:27.491 --> 00:58:31.570
<v Speaker 5>Hutto versus pedis is going to be a very interesting test to see where pedis is</v>

1569
00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:35.830
<v Speaker 5>at this stage of his career and to see if so Hutto can continue to show these</v>

1570
00:58:35.831 --> 00:58:40.480
<v Speaker 5>massive jumps and leaps of improvement that he showed in his last fight against</v>

1571
00:58:40.481 --> 00:58:41.380
<v Speaker 5>Wilson Hayes,</v>

1572
00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:43.930
<v Speaker 5>the Overeem and Gyno fight.</v>

1573
00:58:43.931 --> 00:58:44.590
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

1574
00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:45.220
<v Speaker 5>Amen.</v>

1575
00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:46.510
<v Speaker 5>That could be chaos.</v>

1576
00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:51.540
<v Speaker 5>I am interested to see whether or not Francis in Gando can catch Alistair</v>

1577
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:57.120
<v Speaker 5>Overeem or whether or not he finds himself against a guy who's far too crafty</v>

1578
00:58:57.311 --> 00:58:58.630
<v Speaker 5>for him at this stage of his career.</v>

1579
00:58:58.631 --> 00:58:58.841
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1580
00:58:58.841 --> 00:58:59.830
<v Speaker 5>we really don't know.</v>

1581
00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:00.520
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1582
00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:03.910
<v Speaker 5>he fought our Laskey in his last fight,</v>

1583
00:59:03.911 --> 00:59:05.620
<v Speaker 5>but with all due respect,</v>

1584
00:59:05.621 --> 00:59:10.060
<v Speaker 5>I do not believe that [inaudible] is in the same category as over him.</v>

1585
00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:13.000
<v Speaker 5>I think Overeem represents another level of danger.</v>

1586
00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:17.530
<v Speaker 5>And on top of that over is a very good ground game that a lot of people are</v>

1587
00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.750
<v Speaker 5>forgetting about Overeem one,</v>

1588
00:59:19.751 --> 00:59:23.780
<v Speaker 5>the Abu Dhabi European trials he submitted Vito Belfort.</v>

1589
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:24.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1590
00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:27.140
<v Speaker 5>Overeem has legitimate submission skills submitted,</v>

1591
00:59:27.141 --> 00:59:28.610
<v Speaker 5>Mark Hunt over in,</v>

1592
00:59:28.611 --> 00:59:29.480
<v Speaker 5>can submit guys,</v>

1593
00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:31.940
<v Speaker 5>he's got good wrestling skills as well.</v>

1594
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:35.540
<v Speaker 5>You've got to remember he took Stephan struve to the ground with a beautiful</v>

1595
00:59:35.541 --> 00:59:37.790
<v Speaker 5>take down that Teekay owed him when he got him to the ground.</v>

1596
00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:38.540
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1597
00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:41.480
<v Speaker 5>he may choose to try to take Francis and Ghana to the ground.</v>

1598
00:59:41.481 --> 00:59:41.780
<v Speaker 5>We might,</v>

1599
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:42.740
<v Speaker 5>we might see that.</v>

1600
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:44.083
<v Speaker 5>We don't know.</v>

1601
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.720
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1602
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:45.200
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

1603
00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.200
<v Speaker 5>it's a very interesting fight to see where in Ghana is at this stage of his</v>

1604
00:59:48.201 --> 00:59:53.201
<v Speaker 5>career and the biggest test of his career so far and a fight that Overeem was</v>

1605
00:59:53.661 --> 00:59:54.321
<v Speaker 5>looking for.</v>

1606
00:59:54.321 --> 00:59:59.321
<v Speaker 5>Overeem believes that he has the skills to put in Ghana in his place and</v>

1607
00:59:59.811 --> 01:00:02.780
<v Speaker 5>reestablish himself as the number one contender in the heavyweight division.</v>

1608
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:04.071
<v Speaker 5>That makes,</v>

1609
01:00:04.071 --> 01:00:04.460
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1610
01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.990
<v Speaker 5>that makes me very happy to see that fight.</v>

1611
01:00:05.991 --> 01:00:06.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm very pumped.</v>

1612
01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:10.490
<v Speaker 5>And then of course for all the marbles in the featherweight division,</v>

1613
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:13.970
<v Speaker 5>Max Holloway versus Josie motherfucking,</v>

1614
01:00:13.971 --> 01:00:15.200
<v Speaker 5>although for the title,</v>

1615
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1616
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:17.190
<v Speaker 5>with a guy like all know,</v>

1617
01:00:17.191 --> 01:00:21.530
<v Speaker 5>you got to remember you're talking about a guy who was the best ever at</v>

1618
01:00:21.531 --> 01:00:24.140
<v Speaker 5>featherweight for a long fucking time.</v>

1619
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:28.220
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about a god that up until that Conor McGregor fight had beaten</v>

1620
01:00:28.221 --> 01:00:30.020
<v Speaker 5>everybody that they put in front of him.</v>

1621
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:34.790
<v Speaker 5>He rebounded fantastic from that fight with the Frankie Edgar fight and then got</v>

1622
01:00:34.791 --> 01:00:36.290
<v Speaker 5>beat down by Mac Holloway.</v>

1623
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:38.690
<v Speaker 5>I want to see where he's at right now.</v>

1624
01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:43.670
<v Speaker 5>I want to see whether or not he can read browned and I want to see after 29</v>

1625
01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.610
<v Speaker 5>professional MMA fights at the highest level,</v>

1626
01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:48.350
<v Speaker 5>at 31 years of age,</v>

1627
01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:52.220
<v Speaker 5>does he still have what it takes to fight it a world championship level and can</v>

1628
01:00:52.221 --> 01:00:53.540
<v Speaker 5>he come back better than ever.</v>

1629
01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:55.220
<v Speaker 5>Now with Max Holloway,</v>

1630
01:00:55.221 --> 01:00:56.054
<v Speaker 5>he is.</v>

1631
01:00:56.090 --> 01:00:57.500
<v Speaker 5>He's a fucking killer.</v>

1632
01:00:57.770 --> 01:01:01.220
<v Speaker 5>Max Holloway has everything you want to see in a champion,</v>

1633
01:01:01.221 --> 01:01:02.510
<v Speaker 5>a championships mindset,</v>

1634
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:06.740
<v Speaker 5>and the way he wanted to go down at 25 years of age too.</v>

1635
01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:06.981
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1636
01:01:06.981 --> 01:01:08.810
<v Speaker 5>just keeps getting better.</v>

1637
01:01:08.811 --> 01:01:10.280
<v Speaker 5>He's not even near his prime,</v>

1638
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:16.030
<v Speaker 5>the way he wanted to go down to Brazil and beat Joe's I Aldo in Rio.</v>

1639
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:18.020
<v Speaker 5>And the way he said it,</v>

1640
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.660
<v Speaker 5>that he wanted to fight him in his country,</v>

1641
01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:21.261
<v Speaker 5>then that,</v>

1642
01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:22.610
<v Speaker 5>and that's what kings do.</v>

1643
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:26.090
<v Speaker 5>They go to the other person's kingdom and take their throne.</v>

1644
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:27.740
<v Speaker 5>And that's what he did.</v>

1645
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:29.270
<v Speaker 5>Very exciting fight.</v>

1646
01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.220
<v Speaker 5>So I'm fucking pumped for next Saturday night.</v>

1647
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:32.190
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1648
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>now to answer some of the criticisms and questions,</v>

1649
01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have been saying,</v>

1650
01:01:36.001 --> 01:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1651
01:01:36.570 --> 01:01:38.010
<v Speaker 1>you should probably do this with guests.</v>

1652
01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.950
<v Speaker 1>I am absolutely going to do this with guests.</v>

1653
01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:45.980
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why I didn't do this one with a guest is because of my pitch.</v>

1654
01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm on vacation and I felt like I owed everybody want,</v>

1655
01:01:49.351 --> 01:01:51.210
<v Speaker 1>cause this is how it was going to do one of these things every week.</v>

1656
01:01:51.211 --> 01:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>But the next one I do,</v>

1657
01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>I will bring in a guest and I'm going to bring in,</v>

1658
01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try and bring in more fighters.</v>

1659
01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:57.481
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1660
01:01:57.481 --> 01:02:02.481
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the best way I think to do a fight or podcasts,</v>

1661
01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:03.594
<v Speaker 1>not just,</v>

1662
01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm definitely gonna do more like where I just sit down and do a regular</v>

1663
01:02:07.441 --> 01:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>podcast with them for the jre podcast.</v>

1664
01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to just a straight MMA podcast,</v>

1665
01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do quite a few of these,</v>

1666
01:02:15.781 --> 01:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>bring guys and bring some guys in that are interesting that don't think,</v>

1667
01:02:19.531 --> 01:02:20.364
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1668
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:21.130
<v Speaker 1>maybe uh,</v>

1669
01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:21.963
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1670
01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:25.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe some of you folks who've never heard talk before so that,</v>

1671
01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>that'd be cool.</v>

1672
01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1673
01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:30.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm also going to ask questions or a,</v>

1674
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>have you guys ask questions?</v>

1675
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm going to do is,</v>

1676
01:02:33.181 --> 01:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1677
01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:38.720
<v Speaker 1>for the next one I'm going to put a post up on Instagram and allow you guys and</v>

1678
01:02:39.691 --> 01:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>Gals and non-binary folks to put,</v>

1679
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>how long do we have to say that for non binary,</v>

1681
01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:48.960
<v Speaker 1>how many of you are out there that are non-binary?</v>

1682
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Is it really important to address you?</v>

1683
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:51.601
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel left out?</v>

1684
01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.910
<v Speaker 1>If I don't humans,</v>

1685
01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to allow all of you humans to ask questions and we'll,</v>

1686
01:02:59.221 --> 01:02:59.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1687
01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:03.810
<v Speaker 1>pick some good ones and throw those out there as well in the podcast.</v>

1688
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:06.150
<v Speaker 1>So that's it for now.</v>

1689
01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:06.871
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1694
01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he's funny,</v>

1695
01:03:14.881 --> 01:03:16.500
<v Speaker 1>but he's also a power lifting legend.</v>

1696
01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:17.970
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be here.</v>

1697

1700
01:03:23.101 --> 01:03:26.610
<v Speaker 1>one of the funniest motherfuckers on the planet earth and a guy who people are</v>

1701
01:03:26.611 --> 01:03:27.570
<v Speaker 1>sleeping on.</v>

1702
01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:30.480
<v Speaker 1>People just don't know how good Owen Smith is.</v>

1703
