00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 2>I liked Danko.</v>

81
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.330
<v Speaker 2>He's a good dude.</v>

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.760
<v Speaker 2>But I remember when he had the super finger get the fuck outta here,</v>

83
00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:46.594
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.860
<v Speaker 2>It became his thing.</v>

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.443
<v Speaker 2>I don't know of a finger.</v>

91
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.600
<v Speaker 2>So that's a dramatic marketing move.</v>

96
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 2>You don't need that,</v>

97
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.840
<v Speaker 2>but you can get a with</v>

98

<v Speaker 2>Jetta with boys with matches.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't trust.</v>

114
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.060

118
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.230
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna do is we're going to get a less talented comedian and feed them</v>

119
00:02:57.231 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 2>lines that we can come up with and if that's a great idea at them to infiltrate</v>

<v Speaker 4>It didn't bother me.</v>

449
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.840
<v Speaker 4>Every time I meet one of these fans,</v>

<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

00:12:37.281 --> 00:12:38.520
<v Speaker 4>And you need to learn how to black kids.</v>

00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 4>UFC was like,</v>

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.330
<v Speaker 4>it makes,</v>

460
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.520
<v Speaker 4>that turns me off to those fans,</v>

461
00:12:45.521 --> 00:12:46.470
<v Speaker 4>maybe not even wanna talk to him.</v>

462
00:12:46.471 --> 00:12:48.760
<v Speaker 4>So once I just walk away or cussed them out,</v>

463
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.440
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a problem with the Internet and the problem with the accessibility</v>

464
00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:54.980
<v Speaker 1>that you even run it to a certain amount of shit.</v>

465
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.860
<v Speaker 4>I know we do this the problem.</v>

466
00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.431
<v Speaker 4>That's where I'm at.</v>

467
00:12:57.431 --> 00:12:58.810
<v Speaker 4>Then I figured,</v>

468
00:12:58.811 --> 00:12:59.644
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

469
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.160
<v Speaker 4>They didn't start to shift to a,</v>

470
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.033
<v Speaker 4>came here,</v>

471
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.200
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

472
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:04.751

474
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't say you got your job,</v>

475
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:06.521
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

476
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:07.354
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

477
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.170
<v Speaker 4>I can honestly say that I'm wrong for even going in San and intermediate,</v>

478
00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:13.330
<v Speaker 4>but when I did the interview or yeah,</v>

479
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:14.740
<v Speaker 4>I must've just seen some shit.</v>

480
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.060
<v Speaker 4>That's how I work.</v>

481
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.230
<v Speaker 4>I must've just saying some shit.</v>

482
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.470
<v Speaker 4>I just heard some shit right before I did the interview and that's how I work</v>

483
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:22.990
<v Speaker 4>because I don't remember what I said now.</v>

484
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:25.580
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

485
00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.413
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

486
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:30.180
<v Speaker 1>I just want you to know that it's never disrespectful and if I,</v>

<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>

545
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously if you were Santorum,</v>

546
00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.210
<v Speaker 4>you would just want people to kill abortion doctors and such as tick.</v>

547
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.450
<v Speaker 4>That's what he wants.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I would let people do that.</v>

550
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.223

551
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:39.920
<v Speaker 4>He wants you think that's what's underneath it all starts with stuff.</v>

552
00:16:39.921 --> 00:16:44.100
<v Speaker 4>Just took his [inaudible] pretty sure whenever guys trying to stop gay things,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

555
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:47.761

556
00:16:47.761 --> 00:16:52.270
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's 10% but if you're allowing gay things then you're gay or straight.</v>

557
00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.040
<v Speaker 4>If you're promoting gay things should definitely do,</v>

558
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.290
<v Speaker 4>can't win out of the closet.</v>

00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:31.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean she was getting no numbers and so she went back to Texas and she endorsed</v>

589
00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:32.773
<v Speaker 4>Mitt Romney</v>

590
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.890
<v Speaker 4>but getting back to a gay,</v>

591
00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.040
<v Speaker 4>what's the gay is thing like if you had to think in your life that was,</v>

592
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:44.690
<v Speaker 4>what was the moment you are the gayest I guess Jujitsu.</v>

593
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

594
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.001
<v Speaker 5>essentially.</v>

595
00:17:47.001 --> 00:17:47.480
<v Speaker 5>And your,</v>

596
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 5>your your fucking underwear but cop</v>

597
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.810
<v Speaker 4>on she ever get any?</v>

598
00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:52.680
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

599
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.880
<v Speaker 4>Anybody else ever get any,</v>

600
00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.270
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

601
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:54.961
<v Speaker 4>that would be a bump.</v>

602
00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:56.190
<v Speaker 4>That would make it a real fight.</v>

603
00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:01.250
<v Speaker 4>That would instantly transition to like your story that you told them the</v>

604
00:18:01.501 --> 00:18:04.350
<v Speaker 4>podcasts about going over the rave scene seems the girl and he had a bone or the</v>

605
00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:05.184
<v Speaker 4>whole time,</v>

606
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.880
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

607
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.713
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

608
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.840
<v Speaker 4>I think I did that with Jujitsu.</v>

609
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.800
<v Speaker 4>That would be a real problem though.</v>

610
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.600
<v Speaker 4>That should be a sport is two guys wrestling and one of them has to get an</v>

611
00:18:15.601 --> 00:18:17.310
<v Speaker 4>erection to start the fight.</v>

612
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.230
<v Speaker 4>That guy could attack first and you can only defend until you got your dick</v>

613
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.353
<v Speaker 4>hard.</v>

614
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.820
<v Speaker 4>That might be the gayest thing I've ever done.</v>

615
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.140
<v Speaker 4>It's the gas thing ever.</v>

616
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.640
<v Speaker 4>That might be the greatest thing I ever thought up.</v>

617
00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.830
<v Speaker 4>Gay and aggressive and dominant.</v>

618
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.780
<v Speaker 4>What's the closest you ever came to?</v>

619
00:18:36.781 --> 00:18:38.130
<v Speaker 4>What will be considered date rape?</v>

620
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.710
<v Speaker 4>Like with a girl like that?</v>

621
00:18:40.711 --> 00:18:41.940
<v Speaker 4>I did not scan of gay.</v>

622
00:18:41.941 --> 00:18:42.774
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

623
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.890
<v Speaker 4>I guess when you're young and the girl says no and you keep,</v>

624
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.870
<v Speaker 4>you keep grabbing her hand and put it on your tenure and yeah,</v>

625
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's essentially she's saying no and you're still trying to put her</v>

626
00:18:53.011 --> 00:18:53.730
<v Speaker 4>hand on your deck.</v>

627
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:54.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

628
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.080
<v Speaker 4>but you never know when they go.</v>

629
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.750
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

630
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:56.583
<v Speaker 4>Now</v>

631
00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.910
<v Speaker 4>let's talk a lot about rape.</v>

632
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.020
<v Speaker 4>I noticed what were around you</v>

633
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.690
<v Speaker 4>were on you or rape instincts kick in.</v>

635
00:19:07.421 --> 00:19:08.910
<v Speaker 4>there's something about you that,</v>

636
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm not getting them out of rapists but like all I want to do is fucking ray</v>

637
00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:15.000

<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>

639
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.640
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's a Boston thing.</v>

640
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:18.700
<v Speaker 4>Can you grab that?</v>

641
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.780
<v Speaker 4>Still go with this.</v>

642
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.793
<v Speaker 4>I'm not on,</v>

643
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.030
<v Speaker 4>that would be the gayest thing you've ever done.</v>

644
00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:25.350
<v Speaker 4>I thought you bought that for your girl.</v>

645
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:27.820
<v Speaker 4>You didn't buy it for her.</v>

646
00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.580
<v Speaker 4>He bought for a joke for somebody not cool dildo.</v>

647
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.200
<v Speaker 4>They're always black cause that's what everybody wants.</v>

648
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.310
<v Speaker 4>They want,</v>

649
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.840
<v Speaker 4>they want Reggie Bush.</v>

650
00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:38.373
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

651
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.190
<v Speaker 4>is that what it was to me on ports.</v>

652
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:44.280
<v Speaker 4>I know female at once.</v>

653
00:19:44.281 --> 00:19:49.281
<v Speaker 4>You can buy a fleshlight that that's like a women's like a porn stars vagina.</v>

654
00:19:49.291 --> 00:19:51.360
<v Speaker 4>They do they have that from your point?</v>

655
00:19:51.361 --> 00:19:51.840
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

656
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.021
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

657
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:52.854
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>

658
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah they have that.</v>

659
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:54.290
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

660
00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:56.680
<v Speaker 4>I bet they have a for dudes bottles cause I know,</v>

661
00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:57.893
<v Speaker 4>I bet they do.</v>

662
00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:58.973
<v Speaker 4>Gay dudes.</v>

663
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.310
<v Speaker 4>How'd you like to be the guy that's going to measure and sculpted?</v>

664
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.133
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't like to be that guy.</v>

665
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:05.660
<v Speaker 4>That would be the gang.</v>

666
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:09.180
<v Speaker 4>It's the electric rate.</v>

667
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.260
<v Speaker 4>Well I want to,</v>

668
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 4>I feel like at some points in the interview I started interviewing you and I</v>

669
00:20:16.621 --> 00:20:17.281
<v Speaker 4>apologize.</v>

670
00:20:17.281 --> 00:20:18.900
<v Speaker 4>It was like a conversation.</v>

671
00:20:18.901 --> 00:20:22.020
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't even an envelope and there were some things I just wanted to ask you.</v>

672
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:25.430
<v Speaker 4>Open ended existential things because uh,</v>

673
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.040
<v Speaker 4>I think that you have a unique perspectives on things.</v>

674
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:30.510
<v Speaker 4>And so I was curious about some of them,</v>

675
00:20:30.511 --> 00:20:34.620
<v Speaker 4>like gun control we were talking about earlier and I was always for gun control.</v>

676
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.890
<v Speaker 4>And a couple of weeks ago I completely flipped sides.</v>

677
00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:40.320
<v Speaker 4>And now I don't think that everyone should have a gun,</v>

678
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:41.760
<v Speaker 4>but I just can't.</v>

679
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:42.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

680
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm a facts guy and I looked at all the numbers and it's very hard to</v>

681
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.700
<v Speaker 4>legitimately say that we need to</v>

682
00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.060
<v Speaker 5>have gun control.</v>

683
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.050
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

684
00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.170
<v Speaker 5>there should be some control or some criminal shouldn't be allowed to have guns.</v>

685
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:55.220
<v Speaker 5>And I agree it shouldn't be,</v>

686
00:20:55.221 --> 00:20:57.080
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't be screenings.</v>

687
00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:57.380
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

688
00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.340
<v Speaker 5>there should be that,</v>

689
00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.350
<v Speaker 5>that I agree with all that stuff.</v>

690
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.860
<v Speaker 5>But what I don't agree with is the idea that we live in some sort of a Utopian</v>

691
00:21:03.861 --> 00:21:06.890
<v Speaker 5>society where violence has been cured and you don't need to protect yourself.</v>

692
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.000
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

693
00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.200
<v Speaker 5>If cops have guns,</v>

694
00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:10.100
<v Speaker 5>people should have guns.</v>

695
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.960
<v Speaker 5>There's a reason why the compounds that we've got,</v>

696
00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.000
<v Speaker 5>the cop asked to have a gun to protect society.</v>

697
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.781
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

698
00:21:14.781 --> 00:21:15.710
<v Speaker 5>one of the cops aren't there.</v>

699
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:16.101
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

700
00:21:16.101 --> 00:21:17.420
<v Speaker 5>you better have a fucking gun.</v>

701
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:18.643
<v Speaker 5>You should have a gun.</v>

702
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.310
<v Speaker 5>You shouldn't use it if you don't have to use it.</v>

703
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:22.970
<v Speaker 4>But would they say brandishing it,</v>

704
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:23.810
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

705
00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:28.700
<v Speaker 4>prevents like 90 something percent of crimes from happening and then eventually</v>

706
00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.600
<v Speaker 4>you don't even have to brand.</v>

707
00:21:29.601 --> 00:21:31.910
<v Speaker 4>It should because people have to wonder if you have one.</v>

708
00:21:31.911 --> 00:21:32.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

709
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.480
<v Speaker 4>I guess I'm not suddenly like I'm not encouraging it.</v>

710
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.260
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

711
00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:41.120
<v Speaker 4>it was fucking mind opening to have held a belief for so many years and then</v>

712
00:21:41.121 --> 00:21:43.970
<v Speaker 4>realize that it was the foundation of it was off.</v>

713
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.833
<v Speaker 4>It's a core tenant</v>

714
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:49.640
<v Speaker 5>of left wing thinking that you're supposed to get the guns or make them as</v>

715
00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:50.900
<v Speaker 5>restrictive as possible.</v>

716
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:51.890
<v Speaker 5>People don't need guns.</v>

717
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:52.880
<v Speaker 5>Guns cause problems.</v>

718
00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:53.901
<v Speaker 5>It's like that's,</v>

719
00:21:53.901 --> 00:21:54.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

720
00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.320
<v Speaker 5>there's certain thinking like abortion should be legal.</v>

721
00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.020
<v Speaker 5>Women has a right to choose and you know when you bring it home you should be</v>

722
00:22:00.021 --> 00:22:00.651
<v Speaker 5>able to shoot the,</v>

723
00:22:00.651 --> 00:22:02.120
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's a fetus,</v>

724
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:02.991
<v Speaker 5>you bring it up to them.</v>

725
00:22:02.991 --> 00:22:05.270
<v Speaker 5>Like what's really going on when you're saying the right to choose to choose to</v>

726
00:22:05.271 --> 00:22:07.250
<v Speaker 5>suck that baby out with the vacuum and kill it.</v>

727
00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:07.950
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

728
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:08.600
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

729
00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.440
<v Speaker 5>Well yes,</v>

730
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.310
<v Speaker 5>sort of.</v>

731
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean at what point in time is it a baby?</v>

732
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.921
<v Speaker 5>Three months.</v>

733
00:22:12.921 --> 00:22:14.450
<v Speaker 5>At four months they started looking like things.</v>

734
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:14.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

735
00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.221
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>

736
00:22:15.221 --> 00:22:19.070
<v Speaker 5>it is illegal then or it's not legal that it's legal then it's a ball of mush.</v>

737
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:19.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

738
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.480
<v Speaker 5>When it comes to looking like a baby,</v>

739
00:22:20.481 --> 00:22:21.630
<v Speaker 5>then it's not like,</v>

740
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.120
<v Speaker 5>but no one wants to even have that discussion.</v>

741
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:24.560
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

742
00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.630
<v Speaker 4>The cat's had a joke.</v>

743
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.101
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

744
00:22:26.101 --> 00:22:30.240
<v Speaker 4>I believe that human life begins after the Second Cup of coffee,</v>

745
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.920
<v Speaker 4>but the best is the Republicans ago.</v>

746
00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:35.221
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

747
00:22:35.221 --> 00:22:36.054
<v Speaker 4>here's the caveat.</v>

748
00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:36.630
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

749
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:38.070
<v Speaker 4>no abortion,</v>

750
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.530
<v Speaker 4>except in the case of rape and incest.</v>

751
00:22:40.531 --> 00:22:40.771
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

752
00:22:40.771 --> 00:22:44.130
<v Speaker 4>So what you're saying is that's a human life and it's being murdered,</v>

753
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.400
<v Speaker 4>but it's okay to murder it if somebody who raped somebody.</v>

754
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.320
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

755
00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.131
<v Speaker 4>if you don't live for,</v>

756
00:22:49.131 --> 00:22:49.840
<v Speaker 4>it's not</v>

757
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.560
<v Speaker 5>Rick Santorum says that you should celebrate the rate baby because it's a gift</v>

758
00:22:53.561 --> 00:22:54.394
<v Speaker 5>from God.</v>

759
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:57.610
<v Speaker 4>How do you celebrate?</v>

760
00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.110
<v Speaker 4>Do you have what you'd even have a board like every birthday,</v>

761
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:03.680
<v Speaker 4>happy birthday to you.</v>

762
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.451
<v Speaker 5>Gift from God.</v>

763
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:05.284
<v Speaker 5>So rape baby.</v>

764
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:05.920
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>

765
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.970
<v Speaker 5>you're like a beautiful baby.</v>

766
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:07.211
<v Speaker 5>I mean the,</v>

767
00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:07.401
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

768
00:23:07.401 --> 00:23:08.111
<v Speaker 5>that guy's a rapist.</v>

769
00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:09.490
<v Speaker 5>And every time you see him,</v>

770
00:23:09.491 --> 00:23:12.840
<v Speaker 5>you have to think about what my baby looks just like this means help me down</v>

771
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.713
<v Speaker 5>Saturday to me.</v>

772
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.060
<v Speaker 5>But he said that you should.</v>

773
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.181
<v Speaker 5>What do you believe?</v>

774
00:23:16.181 --> 00:23:17.260
<v Speaker 5>Should abortion be legal?</v>

775
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.230
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe I have the right to tell you what to do with a bunch of cells in</v>

776
00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:23.290
<v Speaker 5>your body and that we'd have to decide at what point in time does that become a</v>

777
00:23:23.291 --> 00:23:23.710
<v Speaker 5>life?</v>

778
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:24.191
<v Speaker 5>And it was,</v>

779
00:23:24.191 --> 00:23:27.910
<v Speaker 5>it isn't an early detection issue cause it was an early detection issue.</v>

780
00:23:27.911 --> 00:23:32.911
<v Speaker 5>I mean how much different is it to have a birth control pill that tricks</v>

781
00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:37.090
<v Speaker 5>chemically the body into the sperm comes in and tries to do its job,</v>

782
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.670
<v Speaker 5>but there's nothing there because the body thinks that it's already pregnant.</v>

783
00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:42.130
<v Speaker 5>How much different is that than killing two cells?</v>

784
00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.730
<v Speaker 4>The birth control pill actually allow a sperm attach and then it goes right.</v>

785
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.840
<v Speaker 5>No birth control pill is essentially hormones.</v>

786
00:23:49.841 --> 00:23:52.330
<v Speaker 5>The trick the woman's body into thinking that it's already pregnant.</v>

787
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.210
<v Speaker 5>So no sperm ever attaches to it to an over,</v>

788
00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.920
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's not a hundred percent effective.</v>

789
00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.370
<v Speaker 5>The way it works is the women can't get pregnant while they're already pregnant.</v>

790
00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:04.110
<v Speaker 5>So it's setting the hormones that leapt up to about another story with,</v>

791
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:05.460
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

792
00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:05.720
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

793
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.480
<v Speaker 5>Well that's why it really fucks with their whole system,</v>

794
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.101
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

795
00:24:08.101 --> 00:24:08.200
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

796
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.490
<v Speaker 4>It's like you should just be a way,</v>

797
00:24:09.491 --> 00:24:12.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean the diaphragm is a bad example of it,</v>

798
00:24:12.101 --> 00:24:16.630
<v Speaker 4>but diaphragm kind of thing where it just goes in when you're in a period of</v>

799
00:24:16.631 --> 00:24:19.270
<v Speaker 4>your life where you're not going to have babies and it comes off when you're</v>

800
00:24:19.271 --> 00:24:23.050
<v Speaker 4>ready and if you can't and it should be cheap and it should be paid for by the</v>

801
00:24:23.051 --> 00:24:24.610
<v Speaker 4>government function.</v>

802
00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:24.971
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

803
00:24:24.971 --> 00:24:26.440
<v Speaker 4>because they used to make them out of metal,</v>

804
00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.410
<v Speaker 4>I UDS or metal and now they make them out of some kind of thing</v>

805
00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:32.630
<v Speaker 5>or metal and your pussy just to stop loads.</v>

806
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.550
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

807
00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:33.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

808
00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.650
<v Speaker 5>it was a spring.</v>

809
00:24:34.651 --> 00:24:34.790
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

810
00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:35.511
<v Speaker 4>but isn't that,</v>

811
00:24:35.511 --> 00:24:35.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

812
00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:40.810
<v Speaker 4>isn't that a as close to a perfect solution as we can get has just on off.</v>

813
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:41.690
<v Speaker 4>It's an off switch</v>

814
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:42.770
<v Speaker 5>I guess.</v>

815
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:43.101
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

816
00:24:43.101 --> 00:24:45.230
<v Speaker 5>But then like what if society falls apart and you know,</v>

817
00:24:45.231 --> 00:24:48.170
<v Speaker 5>you live in the woods and you really want to have babies now because society</v>

818
00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:49.690
<v Speaker 5>might die off and you've got the slide,</v>

819
00:24:49.691 --> 00:24:52.160
<v Speaker 5>you d stuffed up your pussy and there's no doctors available.</v>

820
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.240
<v Speaker 5>A couple sticks,</v>

821
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.040
<v Speaker 5>pull it out with some tweezers.</v>

822
00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.480
<v Speaker 5>How'd it get in there?</v>

823
00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:57.890
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even look around.</v>

824
00:24:58.690 --> 00:24:58.880
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

825
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.400
<v Speaker 5>you get little circles.</v>

826
00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:01.970
<v Speaker 5>This is what we're going to,</v>

827
00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:03.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to tie a rope to it and the other,</v>

828
00:25:03.611 --> 00:25:08.611
<v Speaker 5>but it's going to put on a horse should have got off and he's got a rug and it</v>

829
00:25:08.871 --> 00:25:09.704
<v Speaker 5>pull the ideas</v>

830
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:16.430
<v Speaker 5>and on that note can doors around or you can go to race track.</v>

831
00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:17.810
<v Speaker 5>Hey Fella,</v>

832
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.750
<v Speaker 5>I went to bed and Suzanne was a video.</v>

833
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.410
<v Speaker 5>You don't even know what the fuck is up.</v>

834
00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:28.250
<v Speaker 5>It should have happened.</v>

835

838
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.140
<v Speaker 5>Is that a bad example?</v>

839
00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.173
<v Speaker 5>That's the reality.</v>

840
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:38.343
<v Speaker 5>Both</v>

841
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.090
<v Speaker 5>true and real</v>

844
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:52.010
<v Speaker 5>we just got done doing the podcast the first time anybody's ever performed songs</v>

845
00:25:52.011 --> 00:25:53.510
<v Speaker 5>on the podcast and that right Brian?</v>

846
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:54.890
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty bad ass.</v>

847
00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.130
<v Speaker 5>Pretty fucking cool.</v>

848
00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:56.963
<v Speaker 5>That's a good time.</v>

849
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.423
<v Speaker 5>We had a great time.</v>

850
00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:00.050
<v Speaker 5>We hit a stride to,</v>

851
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.441
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

852
00:26:00.441 --> 00:26:01.670
<v Speaker 5>it was really fun in 45 minutes.</v>

853
00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:03.870
<v Speaker 5>Then I think runaway,</v>

854
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:06.410
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

855
00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:07.970
<v Speaker 5>I got a lot of positive uh,</v>

856
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.520
<v Speaker 5>Twitter responses or super excited about</v>

857
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.680
<v Speaker 5>the insecure.</v>

858
00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:16.530
<v Speaker 5>It's good.</v>

859
00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:17.730
<v Speaker 5>It's good to have the balance.</v>

860
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:21.090
<v Speaker 5>Most of them are insecure cause he's in subscribes.</v>

861
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:22.101
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

862
00:26:22.101 --> 00:26:25.310
<v Speaker 5>A little bit terrified of being one that</v>

863
00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:27.470
<v Speaker 5>you don't like.</v>

864
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:28.370
<v Speaker 5>Female voices.</v>

865
00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:30.603
<v Speaker 5>What in what way?</v>

866
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.881
<v Speaker 5>Being a pussy.</v>

867
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:33.560
<v Speaker 5>But then now I've accepted it and I enjoy it.</v>

868
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.540
<v Speaker 5>Did you enjoy being a pussy or excepted accepted people that call you a pussy?</v>

869
00:26:38.541 --> 00:26:39.250
<v Speaker 5>You're assholes.</v>

870
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.083
<v Speaker 5>You know what it is.</v>

871
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:41.290
<v Speaker 5>But that's true.</v>

872
00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:42.010
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

873
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 5>But the problem is sometimes you know,</v>

874
00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 5>you get a</v>

875
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.870
<v Speaker 4>resent non pussies and that's really not fair.</v>

876
00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:46.240
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

877
00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.210
<v Speaker 4>this sort of reverse type of discrimination</v>

878
00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.970
<v Speaker 4>except him off reverse discrimination sticks.</v>

879
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:55.320
<v Speaker 4>Agency did.</v>

880
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.260
<v Speaker 4>You can be a bad ass.</v>

881
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.140
<v Speaker 4>We need you.</v>

882
00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:57.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

883
00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.530
<v Speaker 4>That was the yellow belt for a minute.</v>

884
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

885
00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:00.360
<v Speaker 4>It's when you're a little kid.</v>

886
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:00.531
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

887
00:27:00.531 --> 00:27:00.711
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

888
00:27:00.711 --> 00:27:01.200
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

889
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.033
<v Speaker 4>It was spread the light.</v>

890
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.353
<v Speaker 4>Oh and karate.</v>

891
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:05.910
<v Speaker 4>If you took my my shirt there I'd go,</v>

892
00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.210
<v Speaker 4>oh you know how to do it.</v>

893
00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:08.370
<v Speaker 4>Probably take your hand.</v>

894
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:09.203
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

895
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:13.360
<v Speaker 4>Like a panther edit out.</v>

896
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.020
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

897
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.460
<v Speaker 4>but you started doing it recently,</v>

898
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:17.731
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

899
00:27:17.731 --> 00:27:18.680
<v Speaker 4>You started taking Jujitsu?</v>

900
00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:18.990
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

901
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.711
<v Speaker 4>A little while ago.</v>

902
00:27:19.711 --> 00:27:20.550
<v Speaker 4>I got the shrimp out.</v>

903
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.420
<v Speaker 4>I've got a couple of them.</v>

904
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.003
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry.</v>

905
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

906
00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.030
<v Speaker 4>If you know other than the shrimp out,</v>

907
00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.570
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to test me in a combat situation.</v>

908
00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.620
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather know I can do a full Nelson and I heard that,</v>

909
00:27:31.621 --> 00:27:33.630
<v Speaker 4>but apparently I heard that was illegal in wrestling.</v>

910
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:34.523
<v Speaker 4>I know how to chill.</v>

911
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:35.583
<v Speaker 4>I'm serious.</v>

912
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.781
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

913
00:27:36.781 --> 00:27:37.440
<v Speaker 4>The one thing,</v>

914
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.940
<v Speaker 4>I think it's illegal in Eritrea</v>

915
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.870
<v Speaker 1>that it's a rear naked choke,</v>

916
00:27:40.871 --> 00:27:43.720
<v Speaker 1>but if you give it like that on the head,</v>

917
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:45.130
<v Speaker 1>actually us more leverage.</v>

918
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.500
<v Speaker 4>If you go like karate chop.</v>

919
00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:47.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

920
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.610
<v Speaker 4>as you,</v>

921
00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:48.810
<v Speaker 4>as you get it underneath the neck,</v>

922
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:51.230
<v Speaker 4>under the arms.</v>

923
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:55.430
<v Speaker 4>This one right here was this way and then this one lyric there,</v>

924
00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:59.390
<v Speaker 4>grab your bicep like this and then you karate chop the back of his head like</v>

925
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.010
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

926
00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:00.270
<v Speaker 4>We're not,</v>

927
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.710
<v Speaker 4>that's where the pressure comes in,</v>

928
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:03.431
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like I,</v>

929
00:28:03.431 --> 00:28:04.590
<v Speaker 4>my Chin tell you really,</v>

930
00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:05.520
<v Speaker 4>you really go,</v>

931
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:05.761
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

932
00:28:05.761 --> 00:28:06.800
<v Speaker 4>he's got his Chin Tuck.</v>

933
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.393
<v Speaker 4>You want to get under that,</v>

934
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.200
<v Speaker 4>but if you've got a really good squeeze,</v>

935
00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:11.340
<v Speaker 4>you can take him from there.</v>

936
00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:12.383
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you something.</v>

937
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:12.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

940
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.210
<v Speaker 4>That was an easy,</v>

941
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.230
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't always work.</v>

942
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.320
<v Speaker 4>See a lot of these techniques that take years to train.</v>

943
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:19.291
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

944
00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:20.230
