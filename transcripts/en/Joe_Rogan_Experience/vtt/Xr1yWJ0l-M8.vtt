00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:03.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

3
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.510
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was the doctor behind that movie concussion,</v>

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>he was recently talking about Oj Simpson because Oj Simpson was released and</v>

5
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:10.021
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

6
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>this is 100% chance that guy has CTE.</v>

7
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>And they've even said that Oj,</v>

8
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>if the trial was today,</v>

9
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:20.780
<v Speaker 1>his doctor said that he would introduce CTE as a defense,</v>

10
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy because then you have to say he's guilty because the defense was</v>

11
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:25.771
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>

12
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:26.604
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do it,</v>

13
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.721
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

14
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>And he wrote a book how I did it.</v>

15
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.623
<v Speaker 1>If I did it,</v>

17
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.410
<v Speaker 1>that was the book.</v>

18
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.801
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

19
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:33.820
<v Speaker 1>But anF is in tiny little red mark.</v>

20
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>And I did it.</v>

21
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.713
<v Speaker 1>I watched the CH,</v>

22
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 1>the Cuba Gooding show last night,</v>

23
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>the FX show.</v>

24
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:40.430
<v Speaker 1>I'd never seen it.</v>

25
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Never seen people versus Oj Simpson.</v>

26
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.880
<v Speaker 1>It was a great record.</v>

27
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.203
<v Speaker 1>Great show.</v>

29
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>it's Weird Watch,</v>

31
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

32
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Just to revisit everything like woof,</v>

33
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>the night when the Oj got out,</v>

34
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:51.751
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

35
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:52.584
<v Speaker 1>just go away.</v>

36
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Just go quiet.</v>

38
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Don't say anything.</v>

39
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Play Golf and keep your mouth shut.</v>

40
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.143
<v Speaker 1>He can do,</v>

41
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to and you can't.</v>

42
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.311
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

43
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 1>he's addicted to love.</v>

45
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>He's addicted to people liking them.</v>

46
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>And there's going to always,</v>

47
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>if he goes to Florida,</v>

48
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.230
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of fucking stupid people in forest go and make them right there</v>

49
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>or he's going back to jail.</v>

50
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna do something stupid and violate his parole.</v>

51
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you'll do that though?</v>

52
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>It's seven years old or whatever he is.</v>

53
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 1>if he does anything other than shut up,</v>

55
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>he's either going to die or go back to jail.</v>

56
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.351
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

57
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no,</v>

58
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>there's no positive that's going to come out of him making public appearances,</v>

59
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:34.081
<v Speaker 1>writing a book,</v>

61
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:35.450
<v Speaker 1>going on a talk show circuit.</v>

62
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.701
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

63
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:35.971
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

64
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>like you're 78 years old,</v>

65
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>live out the last 10,</v>

66
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.281
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

67
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:41.881
<v Speaker 1>20 years,</v>

68
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>whatever he got with just live it.</v>

69
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:43.921
<v Speaker 1>There isn't,</v>

70
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>there's money somewhere,</v>

71
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.451
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

72
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:46.111
<v Speaker 1>Cause Florida,</v>

73
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:48.230
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't take his money there.</v>

74
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

75
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>he's gotten money somewhere.</v>

76
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.213
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

77
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 1>just quietly fade away.</v>

78
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.581
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

79
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:54.390
<v Speaker 1>let people,</v>

80
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>people might recognize you when you go down to play Bingo at the home.</v>

81
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Just wave banks Marlboro.</v>

82
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

83
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

86
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

87
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.531
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

88
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any way.</v>

89
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>There's no positive public appearance.</v>

90
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

91
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.390
<v Speaker 1>That Oj could make make.</v>

92
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.680
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

93
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.390
<v Speaker 2>it was a really,</v>

94
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.470
<v Speaker 2>really intense,</v>

95
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.120
<v Speaker 2>and during that time,</v>

96
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.480
<v Speaker 2>two of his friends die within two weeks of each other of heart attacks at age 52</v>

97
00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:22.870
<v Speaker 2>and 59.</v>

98
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.700
<v Speaker 2>And Nikita Kemiah,</v>

99
00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:27.010
<v Speaker 2>of WHO's 52 years old and he's running,</v>

100
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.730
<v Speaker 2>he had resigned from running the Russian antidoping agency.</v>

101
00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:31.360
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

102
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.900
<v Speaker 2>so technically the Russian anti-doping agencies shouldn't be working with</v>

103
00:02:34.901 --> 00:02:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Gregory's lab.</v>

104
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.630
<v Speaker 2>The Wada,</v>

105
00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:40.840
<v Speaker 2>the world antidoping agency lab low should be two independent things.</v>

106
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.120
<v Speaker 2>But these two were working together because there was never any anti-doping.</v>

107
00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Russia was the anti anti doping system posing as anti-doping.</v>

108
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.370
<v Speaker 2>So Nikita is still in Russia.</v>

109
00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:58.060
<v Speaker 2>He's been forced to resign and Gregory and him are still talking via,</v>

110
00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

111
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.213
<v Speaker 2>via Skype.</v>

112
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.113
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

113
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.781
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

114
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

115
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 2>Nikita tells Gregory that he's going to go,</v>

116
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

117
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 2>but he's writing a book and that he's been in contact with David Walsh.</v>

118
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 2>And David Walsh is the Sunday Times journalists that chased Armstrong for 10</v>

119
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

120
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.310
<v Speaker 2>He's probably one of the most renowned famous sports journalists in the world.</v>

121
00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

122
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 2>that Stephen Frears film,</v>

123
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 2>the programs based on David Walsh and send,</v>

124
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Nikita had reached out to David Walsh and him and David Walsh,</v>

125
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 2>we're making a plan to meet.</v>

126
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 2>And Nikita had told Gregory that,</v>

127
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

128
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 2>he was going to meet with David Walsh.</v>

129
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:33.881
<v Speaker 2>Gregory was like,</v>

130
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:34.301
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

131
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 2>you can't do this.</v>

132
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:36.140
<v Speaker 2>You're still in Russian.</v>

133
00:03:36.141 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Nikita,</v>

134
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 2>you're still in Russia.</v>

135
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:38.224
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

136
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.421
<v Speaker 2>And a,</v>

137
00:03:39.421 --> 00:03:40.190
<v Speaker 2>a day later,</v>

138
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Nikita dies of a heart attack.</v>

139
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 2>And this was a guy who was healthy,</v>

140
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

141
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 2>had never had a heart problem in his life,</v>

142
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>

143
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 2>it was a lifelong athlete.</v>

144
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.911
<v Speaker 2>Never end.</v>

145
00:03:49.911 --> 00:03:54.911
<v Speaker 2>He was 52 52 and apparently he died over about three and a half hours while,</v>

146
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

147
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 2>Nikita's wife was on the phone to Gregory crying.</v>

148
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.203
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

149
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 2>so this is a really have any suspicion of how they did it.</v>

150
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.333
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

151
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

152
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Gregory goes out and they just,</v>

153
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.520
<v Speaker 2>you just die of a heart attack,</v>

154
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 2>that poison yo,</v>

155
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:11.021
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

156
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:11.231
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

157
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

158
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.981
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

159
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:13.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they do it,</v>

160
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:14.141
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

161
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Russia isn't like Isis.</v>

162
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:18.130
<v Speaker 2>They don't do something and then take responsibility and obviously,</v>

163
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

164
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 2>there's been so many stories I can buzz feed last year then of the 14 deaths in</v>

165
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 2>London all tied to,</v>

166
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

167
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 2>various had the series of Russia.</v>

168
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 2>There's been multiple books,</v>

169
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:29.284
<v Speaker 2>written audit,</v>

170
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.513
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

171
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.300
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>

172
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.811
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

173
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

174
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 2>which was not widely reported.</v>

175
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

176
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 2>the Russian agent,</v>

177
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 2>the Co offered a,</v>

178
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 2>apparently the Trump dossier with the mic [inaudible] the former have my six</v>

179
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:41.884
<v Speaker 2>agent.</v>

180
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.281
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

181
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:46.810
<v Speaker 2>he was found dead in the back of Alexis about five months ago outside of Moscow.</v>

182
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.813
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

183
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

184
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

185
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

186
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.870
<v Speaker 2>clearly they,</v>

187
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

188
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.701
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

189
00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 2>they play by a different set of rules.</v>

190
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 3>If you look at how men and women evolved to get partners,</v>

191
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.520
<v Speaker 3>women just have to look hot.</v>

192
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 3>You have to look like you're fertile and young and have good genes,</v>

193
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 3>which is what we consider beauty.</v>

194
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 3>These what feminists say are arbitrary standards of beauty.</v>

195
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 3>Aren't anything like that.</v>

196
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 3>They're very across cultures.</v>

197
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:17.791
<v Speaker 3>Men like women with this hourglass figure and who have long shiny hair and who</v>

198
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 3>are not 72,</v>

199
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 3>because if you had sex with a 72 year old,</v>

200
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 3>your genes died out.</v>

201
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

202
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:29.680
<v Speaker 1>This the feminist thing about arbitrary standards of beauty as a person who is</v>

203
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 1>deeply entrenched in science,</v>

204
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 1>like that's gotta be frustrating,</v>

205
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:33.701
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

206
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Because you're looking at something that's not accurate.</v>

207
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

208
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.971
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

209
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>you're pushing a narrative that's just not accurate.</v>

210
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>There's this very takeaway called Jered takeaway.</v>

211
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:42.941
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

212
00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:43.331
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

213
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:46.060
<v Speaker 1>all your personal feelings about human beings.</v>

214
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.920
<v Speaker 1>And you look at the mammal,</v>

215
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.000
<v Speaker 1>the human mammal,</v>

216
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.631
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

217
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:54.631
<v Speaker 1>it's very clear why the certain males are gravitating towards certain females</v>

218
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>and contrary or,</v>

219
00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:57.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

220
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.801
<v Speaker 1>conversely,</v>

221
00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>why certain females are gravitating towards certain males.</v>

222
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 1>It's biological,</v>

223
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

224
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.591
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>

225
00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:03.940
<v Speaker 3>it's so unhelpful.</v>

226
00:06:03.941 --> 00:06:04.990
<v Speaker 3>It's really awful.</v>

227
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.540
<v Speaker 3>This idea that people should like you for Watson.</v>

228
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Now on the inside,</v>

229
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.630
<v Speaker 3>we don't see that people,</v>

230
00:06:10.631 --> 00:06:11.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

231
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.040
<v Speaker 3>if you look at porn,</v>

232
00:06:12.041 --> 00:06:14.620
<v Speaker 3>it's not the woman who buys a homeless man a sandwich.</v>

233
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.790
<v Speaker 3>You know who in the porn,</v>

234
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.820
<v Speaker 3>it's the woman with those features that are just cross culturally appreciated by</v>

235
00:06:21.401 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 3>men.</v>

236
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.181
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

237
00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:22.961
<v Speaker 1>what's also too,</v>

238
00:06:22.961 --> 00:06:24.970
<v Speaker 1>we're talking only about sexual,</v>

239
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.421
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

240
00:06:25.421 --> 00:06:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Because people do like you for who you are on the inside.</v>

241
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Like Melissa McCarthy is a perfect example.</v>

242
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.660
<v Speaker 1>She's as vibrant,</v>

243
00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:33.580
<v Speaker 1>hilarious woman and no one's,</v>

244
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.030
<v Speaker 1>no one's holding her up as the standard of beauty or sexual attractiveness.</v>

245
00:06:39.641 --> 00:06:39.851
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

246
00:06:39.851 --> 00:06:40.061
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

247
00:06:40.061 --> 00:06:44.020
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at her as this fun person and that's why millions of people go</v>

248
00:06:44.021 --> 00:06:48.400
<v Speaker 1>see her in movies and her TV shows as giant hit mean it's literally what's on</v>

249
00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:51.460
<v Speaker 1>the inside and how she carries herself.</v>

250
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

251
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.370
<v Speaker 3>And she is very vibrant.</v>

252
00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.650
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at that cross cultural research,</v>

253
00:06:55.651 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 3>David Buss who is an evolutionary psychologist,</v>

254
00:06:58.161 --> 00:06:59.400
<v Speaker 3>did the big,</v>

255
00:06:59.401 --> 00:07:03.720
<v Speaker 3>big cross cultural study and kindness was what both men and women wanted.</v>

256
00:07:03.721 --> 00:07:04.800
<v Speaker 3>I think that was the top,</v>

257
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.360
<v Speaker 3>the top of each list.</v>

258
00:07:06.361 --> 00:07:08.880
<v Speaker 3>But if you prioritize,</v>

259
00:07:08.881 --> 00:07:09.121
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

260
00:07:09.121 --> 00:07:09.451
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

261
00:07:09.451 --> 00:07:10.290
<v Speaker 3>well what do I,</v>

262
00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:12.000
<v Speaker 3>what are my must haves in a partner?</v>

263
00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:14.640
<v Speaker 3>A guy is not going to want a very old,</v>

264
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.830
<v Speaker 3>unattractive woman as his partner.</v>

265
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.120
<v Speaker 3>If he can do better.</v>

266
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.300
<v Speaker 3>And a woman is not going to but want to have the guy who was sleeping in</v>

267
00:07:21.301 --> 00:07:23.640
<v Speaker 3>grandma's basement playing Atari,</v>

268
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.410
<v Speaker 3>Atari or whatever.</v>

269
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.071
<v Speaker 3>I'm a girl,</v>

270
00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.890
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know anything about football or video games.</v>

271
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.481
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

272
00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:30.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure when you're,</v>

273
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.080
<v Speaker 4>you were a sex addict and you're in this hedonistic,</v>

274
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.381
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

275
00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 4>whirlwind experience,</v>

276
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.740
<v Speaker 4>you're still,</v>

277
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.110
<v Speaker 4>you're taking in all this data and you're taking all this in,</v>

278
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.500
<v Speaker 4>in the hollow feeling that you had that you didn't like.</v>

279
00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:47.420
<v Speaker 4>It is what propelled you to your new stage of consciousness once you emerge from</v>

280
00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:47.810
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

281
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:47.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

282
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

283
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 4>Every so often,</v>

284
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 4>like because he's like pleasure laden an orgy.</v>

285
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:52.761
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

286
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:53.571
<v Speaker 4>that's the point of it.</v>

287
00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:53.871
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

288
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:54.710
<v Speaker 4>there's flesh everywhere.</v>

289
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:55.371
<v Speaker 4>It's this bits of it.</v>

290
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:56.204
<v Speaker 4>They're brilliant.</v>

291
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.280
<v Speaker 4>I was no in,</v>

292
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:58.101
<v Speaker 4>hold on a minute.</v>

293
00:07:58.101 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 4>This isn't working.</v>

294
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.620
<v Speaker 4>And this is a thing of what would really,</v>

295
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 4>really work.</v>

296
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.001
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

297
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:03.310
<v Speaker 4>like sometimes the,</v>

298
00:08:03.311 --> 00:08:07.310
<v Speaker 4>the great gift of promiscuity is you get to experience the intimacy with all of</v>

299
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:09.020
<v Speaker 4>these strangers and it seemed exciting.</v>

300
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:13.130
<v Speaker 4>And the type of sexuality that I've always had is more about worship then any</v>

301
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:15.050
<v Speaker 4>kind of domination I adore.</v>

302
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:15.920
<v Speaker 4>I adore,</v>

303
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:16.341
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

304
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:17.930
<v Speaker 4>so it's not about like I want to control you.</v>

305
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.890
<v Speaker 4>So like by like the answer to all these wonderful experiences and encounters,</v>

306
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:27.130
<v Speaker 4>but within this kind of ongoing seam of loneliness on ignorable and also this is</v>

307
00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:29.870
<v Speaker 4>the thing,</v>

308
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.200
<v Speaker 4>when you get the things your culture tells you you should be doing and you</v>

309
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 4>experience them now you know,</v>

310
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:38.450
<v Speaker 4>now you know you can stop chasing the carrot because you've had a bite out of it</v>

311
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:38.780
<v Speaker 4>and he's like,</v>

312
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:38.910
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

313
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.100
<v Speaker 4>mini bullshit.</v>

314
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.720
<v Speaker 4>Like you know,</v>

315
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.151
<v Speaker 4>not an,</v>

316
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:44.330
<v Speaker 4>it's a hard one to learn because anything that's got an orgasm at the end of it,</v>

317
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

318
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.250
<v Speaker 4>there's a degree of pleasure to be had,</v>

319
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.180
<v Speaker 4>but it takes,</v>

320
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.480
<v Speaker 4>it takes a while to recognize or what they see the emotional cost and made a</v>

321
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:52.040
<v Speaker 4>spiritual cost on other people.</v>

322
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:52.831
<v Speaker 4>The fact faculty,</v>

323
00:08:52.831 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 4>it's preventing me from becoming a father,</v>

324
00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 4>from becoming husband,</v>

325
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:56.620
<v Speaker 4>from set lien,</v>

326
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 4>from becoming rooted,</v>

327
00:08:57.691 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 4>from becoming actually whole,</v>

328
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 4>from becoming a man,</v>

329
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 4>from becoming connected.</v>

330
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 4>And it takes a while to spot that.</v>

331
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of people don't get the opportunity to break out that pattern.</v>

332
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 4>I would never have spotted it.</v>

333
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.990
<v Speaker 4>Had a not first being a heroin addict and going,</v>

334
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:10.501
<v Speaker 4>hold on a minute.</v>

335
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 4>You're doing that thing again.</v>

336
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 4>Same with fame and celebrity.</v>

337
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.371
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

338
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 4>toxic,</v>

339
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.080
<v Speaker 4>well toxic,</v>

340
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 4>excited and brilliant and loads of lovely people in there.</v>

341
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:19.111
<v Speaker 4>And I still like,</v>

342
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:19.321
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

343
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 4>I might make another film,</v>

344
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:21.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what happened,</v>

345
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.530
<v Speaker 4>but like it's because I'd had the template and the experiences of awe,</v>

346
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:26.430
<v Speaker 4>this is addiction.</v>

347
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:28.470
<v Speaker 4>You're expecting this thing to make you feel better.</v>

348
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.060
<v Speaker 4>Now what's happening is I am as a baseline disabused of the idea that the</v>

349
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:34.050
<v Speaker 4>material world,</v>

350
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 4>we'll give me anything that it will ever fulfill me,</v>

351
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:42.230
<v Speaker 4>that I am responsible for my own connection and that my role here is to serve</v>

352
00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:44.330
<v Speaker 4>other people and help them.</v>

353
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:53.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
