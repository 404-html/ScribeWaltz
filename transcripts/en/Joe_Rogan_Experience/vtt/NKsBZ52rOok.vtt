<v Speaker 1>It just comes up so much now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.423
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might.</v>

46

<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

47
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.810
<v Speaker 2>You gave a seven on your hat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

48
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 2>A dumber pigeons to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well look,</v>

49
00:02:23.491 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I'll in their heads are mad if your head</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that little.</v>

50
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

51
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.390
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Zika babies grow up to be pretty</v>

52
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

53
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 2>we haven't had any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

54
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.840
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't grown up.</v>

55
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 2>I really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

56
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that I've ever heard of.</v>

57
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 2>I just made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's actually adult Zika</v>

58
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:47.800
<v Speaker 2>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so because I was thinking about</v>

59
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 2>making Zika hats for Zika people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it makes it look like their heads are</v>

60
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:51.894
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>

61
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>The whole key is to get somebody who</v>
<v Speaker 1>spars with you.</v>

62
00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>That's not trying to hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just trying to grow with you</v>

63
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 1>and learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so hard because egos get involved</v>

64
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George would never hurt you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

251
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:05.950
<v Speaker 2>we got to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two moving parts here.</v>

252
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 2>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

253
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that answers my</v>
<v Speaker 2>question of how,</v>

254
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.420
<v Speaker 2>but now I need to know the story here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he ties it all together with.</v>

255
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.380
<v Speaker 2>He went on something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just something.</v>

256
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.330
<v Speaker 2>He got an appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He told the story of Mug and a hooker in</v>

257
00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:22.790
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey and setting her wig on fire</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden he blew up overnight</v>

258
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:23.201
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

259
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:26.860
<v Speaker 2>I realized people like the stores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never knew that I had stories from the</v>

260
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:29.020
<v Speaker 2>part of the country I'm in and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood I grew up in.</v>

261
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 2>I thought everybody had these doors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

262
00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:32.310
<v Speaker 2>chill center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought I'd tell you I mogul</v>

263
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.420
<v Speaker 2>hooker and lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wiggling fire.</v>

264
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.911
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

265
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:36.310
<v Speaker 2>well I'm moved 10 hookers and let 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>wigs on fire.</v>

266
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.110
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know I had stories.</v>

267
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.410
<v Speaker 5>Well in that way it's a swap meet in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jersey.</v>

268
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:44.700
<v Speaker 5>They called,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do they call the market?</v>

269
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.640
<v Speaker 5>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a kid.</v>

270
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.830
<v Speaker 5>I used to go to where the use to do the</v>
<v Speaker 5>bicycles,</v>

271
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:54.160
<v Speaker 5>whatever those street car races and next</v>
<v Speaker 5>door to it.</v>

272
00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:59.110
<v Speaker 5>They had what was called and you'd go</v>
<v Speaker 5>there and they had pretty much shit that</v>

273
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:02.230
<v Speaker 5>was stolen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just a festival and they tries to</v>

274
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.950
<v Speaker 5>a table fee because everything was 50</v>
<v Speaker 5>percent off.</v>

275
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.270
<v Speaker 5>Even the sneakers I remember and then we</v>
<v Speaker 5>found that that the guy would go to the</v>

276
00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:14.110
<v Speaker 5>fucking factory and jump over the fence</v>
<v Speaker 5>and take over</v>

277
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.080
<v Speaker 5>the sneakers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no mistakes,</v>

278
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.410
<v Speaker 5>so the irregulars he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would take those and just sell them</v>

279
00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:28.210
<v Speaker 5>at those markets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Swap meets and then we find that we cut</v>

280
00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:29.640
<v Speaker 5>into his action.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just want it gone.</v>

281
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:30.520
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

282
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.190
<v Speaker 5>we cut into that action and the MANACA</v>
<v Speaker 5>action,</v>

283
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.250
<v Speaker 5>they're not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those tubes have been knocked.</v>

284
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.960
<v Speaker 5>Best Prank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would throw thousands of them out</v>

285
00:13:37.961 --> 00:13:39.700
<v Speaker 5>with little things like the chemical was</v>
<v Speaker 5>off.</v>

286
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:44.750
<v Speaker 5>You start blinking too much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the chemical.</v>

287
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.040
<v Speaker 5>Then it was pepper spray,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pepper spray,</v>

288
00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:50.320
<v Speaker 5>like people would spray and you can see</v>
<v Speaker 5>what happened.</v>

289
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.870
<v Speaker 5>It's not regular binocular.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that tear gas.</v>

290
00:13:52.871 --> 00:13:54.420
<v Speaker 5>It was like the tickets.</v>

291
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.510
<v Speaker 5>The Spanish kid that was advertised and</v>
<v Speaker 5>we make them jump the fence and we'd</v>

292
00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:06.250
<v Speaker 5>have thousands of tubes a and we'd sell</v>
<v Speaker 5>them for fifty cents a piece on Monday,</v>

293
00:14:06.251 --> 00:14:09.760
<v Speaker 5>the sixth and seventh grade or virus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there was always three kids that</v>

294
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:12.140
<v Speaker 5>complain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was like the chemical imbalances</v>

295
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:17.460
<v Speaker 5>or</v>
<v Speaker 5>facebook friends with me from high</v>

300
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.640
<v Speaker 5>the Jack Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jack said he used to call her name and</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

325
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.150

<v Speaker 2>It's funny too because you know,</v>

326
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:53.280
<v Speaker 2>we had a bit of a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a falling out recently and you</v>

327
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.900
<v Speaker 2>couldn't find a bigger stars will faint</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

328
00:15:55.901 --> 00:15:58.630
<v Speaker 2>I just listened to his record on the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>over here and it's a fucking</v>

329
00:15:58.631 --> 00:16:01.780
<v Speaker 2>masterpiece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he also won't fucking talk to me</v>

330
00:16:01.781 --> 00:16:02.650
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

331
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing I don't even mind</v>

332
00:16:06.191 --> 00:16:06.910
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

333
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:11.140
<v Speaker 2>I in an interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said that he was,</v>

334
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.650
<v Speaker 2>and this is honestly what I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he is.</v>

335
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.570
<v Speaker 2>And you're going to laugh when I say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I swear this is what I fucking</v>

336
00:16:19.571 --> 00:16:22.390
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a paid ass and</v>

337
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.750
<v Speaker 2>I'll just let that sink in for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's taken motherfuckers out</v>

338
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.910
<v Speaker 5>and they got this farm and they had</v>
<v Speaker 5>these horses.</v>

339
00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:36.290
<v Speaker 5>There was over 100 hours of footage of</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people getting fucked by animals</v>

340
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.970
<v Speaker 5>and one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they type it though.</v>

341
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.280
<v Speaker 5>There's a video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could watch it.</v>

342
00:16:40.281 --> 00:16:41.600
<v Speaker 5>You want to see absolutely.</v>

343
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.080
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>things go wrong all the time.</v>

344
00:16:46.081 --> 00:16:49.800
<v Speaker 7>You can crawl up on the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can declare yourself a victim,</v>

345
00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:54.000
<v Speaker 7>you can give up or you can recognize</v>
<v Speaker 7>that that's just part of life and wake</v>

346
00:16:54.001 --> 00:16:58.830
<v Speaker 7>up the next day with a smile on your</v>
<v Speaker 7>face and continue to move forward and</v>

347
00:16:58.831 --> 00:17:01.560
<v Speaker 7>just do your best.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've told,</v>

348
00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.620
<v Speaker 7>I've told the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

349
00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.140
<v Speaker 7>I think it's really hard to do any</v>
<v Speaker 7>damage to somebody who's willing to tell</v>

350
00:17:07.141 --> 00:17:09.420
<v Speaker 7>the truth regardless of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>consequences.</v>

351
00:17:09.421 --> 00:17:13.620
<v Speaker 7>And then I admit mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think mistakes have a way of.</v>

352
00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:17.970
<v Speaker 7>So compounding themselves just because</v>
<v Speaker 7>people don't acknowledge those mistakes.</v>

353
00:17:17.971 --> 00:17:22.971

<v Speaker 7>presidential debates.</v>

355
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.040

<v Speaker 7>debates,</v>

356
00:17:32.041 --> 00:17:35.540
<v Speaker 7>I have an opportunity of actually</v>

<v Speaker 6>and the little dial in one.</v>

407
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:41.550
<v Speaker 6>I was fucking eating spaghetti and it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>as a complicated thing to eat.</v>

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.100
<v Speaker 6>The lady and the tramp shoving that shit</v>
<v Speaker 6>in and then the next course I think was</v>

00:19:48.101 --> 00:19:50.050
<v Speaker 6>the signer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which was weird because that's to pass</v>

411
00:19:50.051 --> 00:19:51.990
<v Speaker 6>the courses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then I think there was like sort of</v>

412
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:53.110
<v Speaker 6>cupcakes and stuff involved</v>

00:19:55.151 --> 00:19:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Tom Cruise talking about communism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I brought up as a topic,</v>

415
00:19:58.721 --> 00:20:00.610

<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 8>I got invited out by one of the guys,</v>

447
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.040
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and uh,</v>

448
00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.140
<v Speaker 8>just because I think a couple of people</v>
<v Speaker 8>will just,</v>

449
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.870
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>saw one of the guys who was one of the</v>

450
00:21:33.871 --> 00:21:35.070
<v Speaker 8>main guys and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hey,</v>

451
00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.790
<v Speaker 8>I'm walking around downtown Fort Worth</v>
<v Speaker 8>and said,</v>

452
00:21:38.791 --> 00:21:40.020
<v Speaker 8>why don't we go out here,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever.</v>

453
00:21:40.021 --> 00:21:40.561
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all right,</v>

454
00:21:40.561 --> 00:21:41.394
<v Speaker 8>I'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And.</v>

455
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:45.600
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he had actually brought me into a Sushi</v>

456
00:21:45.601 --> 00:21:49.970
<v Speaker 8>restaurant in all around the table was</v>
<v Speaker 8>most of the people that were not most is</v>

457
00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.520
<v Speaker 8>probably only like eight or 10 people,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but they were some of the main kids that</v>

458
00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:55.320
<v Speaker 8>were at that party when I dressed up and</v>
<v Speaker 8>everything.</v>

459
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:56.563
<v Speaker 8>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you,</v>

460
00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.940
<v Speaker 8>if we'd have known you were a fighter or</v>
<v Speaker 8>could've kicked their butts and we</v>

461
00:21:59.941 --> 00:22:02.000
<v Speaker 8>wouldn't have done that to you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I'm just like,</v>

462
00:22:02.001 --> 00:22:03.030
<v Speaker 8>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I told him I was going to the</v>

463
00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:04.530
<v Speaker 8>bathroom just left.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

464
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.780
<v Speaker 8>I think that's the only time I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 8>done anything like that,</v>

465
00:22:06.781 --> 00:22:08.140
<v Speaker 8>but I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can't,</v>

466
00:22:08.141 --> 00:22:09.390
<v Speaker 8>I can't be around these guys.</v>

467
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.500
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think we should talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump for a long time,</v>

468
00:22:12.501 --> 00:22:14.000
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

469
00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:17.240
<v Speaker 2>he's got a lot of charisma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say what you want to love the guy.</v>

470
00:22:17.241 --> 00:22:19.170
<v Speaker 2>He's got a ton of charisma and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

471
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Kind of charisma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

472
00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:24.410
<v Speaker 2>He's got like this mean guy charisma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want him to like you.</v>

473
00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.140
<v Speaker 2>So you say things like you don't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

474
00:22:27.141 --> 00:22:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you want him to like think that</v>

475
00:22:29.121 --> 00:22:31.280
<v Speaker 2>you're on his side so we won't come</v>
<v Speaker 2>after you.</v>

476
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a bully charisma.</v>

477
00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.930
<v Speaker 2>That's absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's charisma nonetheless.</v>

478
00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:38.660
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing about stars and</v>

479
00:22:38.661 --> 00:22:42.830
<v Speaker 2>movie stars and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're watching this guy,</v>

480
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:46.880
<v Speaker 2>you watch denzel Washington waiting for</v>
<v Speaker 2>him to snap.</v>

481
00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.420
<v Speaker 2>He never does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But your weight,</v>

482
00:22:50.421 --> 00:22:53.270
<v Speaker 2>you can tell he's Gunna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just doesn't.</v>

483
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like Robert Downey Jr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like with robert downey jr.</v>

484
00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.920
<v Speaker 2>You're watchIng a guy not do cocaine.</v>

485
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:02.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to do everything in him,</v>

486
00:23:02.541 --> 00:23:07.100
<v Speaker 2>wants to do cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're watching a guy not actively,</v>

487
00:23:07.101 --> 00:23:12.101
<v Speaker 2>not do cocaine from second to second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's such a good analysis.</v>

488
00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you're just trying.</v>

<v Speaker 2>this thing,</v>

490
00:23:16.371 --> 00:23:19.640
<v Speaker 2>this car accident that never happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know somebody to talk to a cop and</v>

491
00:23:19.641 --> 00:23:23.870
<v Speaker 2>they said that when he started working</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then 11 years later.</v>

492
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going into those areas where these</v>

493
00:23:28.221 --> 00:23:31.520
<v Speaker 2>things always happen and after years and</v>
<v Speaker 2>years it just,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

496
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.100
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I barely go back there,</v>

497
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:41.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

502
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.220
<v Speaker 2>some people can't handle those nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You learn how to breathe quietly.</v>

503
00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.160
<v Speaker 2>You don't know like somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could walk down the street and</v>

504
00:23:55.161 --> 00:23:59.160
<v Speaker 2>somebody could pull a pistol out on</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things though.</v>

505
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I've been driving down the street with</v>
<v Speaker 2>my ex lady and she was talking and I was</v>

506
00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:05.420
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get down because I saw a guy draw on a</v>

507
00:24:05.421 --> 00:24:09.920
<v Speaker 2>corner and shoot across the street at</v>
<v Speaker 2>another guy that's the gun went up.</v>

508
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.260
<v Speaker 2>We drove under the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

509
00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:14.750
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fire.</v>

510
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was long,</v>

511
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:17.480
<v Speaker 2>it was long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

512
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.920
<v Speaker 2>And then they went up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went under the second shot off and I</v>

513
00:24:21.921 --> 00:24:23.330
<v Speaker 2>drove and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

514
00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:24.830
<v Speaker 2>that was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm that guy.</v>

515
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.560
<v Speaker 2>She laid it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we made that was crazy.</v>

516
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:29.030
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't call the police.</v>

517
00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:29.531
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

518
00:24:29.531 --> 00:24:32.600
<v Speaker 2>what is he like to tell what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

519
00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how crazy it is that you</v>

520
00:24:37.311 --> 00:24:40.440
<v Speaker 2>don't even want to be involved because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to go to the cops and I end up</v>

521
00:24:40.441 --> 00:24:44.330
<v Speaker 2>calling the police and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like he described the victim.</v>

522
00:24:44.331 --> 00:24:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white t shirt,</v>

523
00:24:45.831 --> 00:24:48.070
<v Speaker 2>blue Jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all I said.</v>

524
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:49.610
<v Speaker 2>And that it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was he black?</v>

525
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:54.700
<v Speaker 2>And it was just a long pause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a long poles and they like sarah</v>

526
00:24:55.101 --> 00:24:57.020
<v Speaker 2>is he black?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

527
00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:57.981
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

528
00:24:57.981 --> 00:24:58.814
<v Speaker 2>that nick was black</v>

529
00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:06.390
<v Speaker 6>men do that all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have several of those in my own,</v>

530
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.060
<v Speaker 6>not nuclear family but my family of</v>
<v Speaker 6>procreation.</v>

531
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.710
<v Speaker 6>So might fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I won't saY who,</v>

532
00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.850
<v Speaker 6>but brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

533
00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.180
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and here's another thing that you never</v>

534
00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:18.090
<v Speaker 6>admit that you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

535
00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:21.300
<v Speaker 6>because admitting that you're wrong</v>
<v Speaker 6>makes you lose face.</v>

536
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.080
<v Speaker 6>And that's such a detrimental dynamic to</v>
<v Speaker 6>have,</v>

537
00:25:25.081 --> 00:25:25.920
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

538
00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might come home at night and um,</v>

539
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.280
<v Speaker 6>I've had a tough day and I might respond</v>
<v Speaker 6>correctly to my dog.</v>

540
00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:36.390
<v Speaker 6>I actually will go back and then hug my</v>
<v Speaker 6>dog because I have enough self awareness</v>

541
00:25:36.391 --> 00:25:38.760
<v Speaker 6>to realize that I didn't give her enough</v>
<v Speaker 6>attention.</v>

542
00:25:38.761 --> 00:25:40.980
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I have enough humilitY to,</v>

543
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.390
<v Speaker 6>nevermind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

544
00:25:42.391 --> 00:25:44.610
<v Speaker 6>another human.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My dog is just as important to me.</v>

545
00:25:44.611 --> 00:25:47.160
<v Speaker 6>And if I responded curtly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I will sort of apologized to Her.</v>

546
00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.450
<v Speaker 6>Yet I've got family members,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

547
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.740
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is not my family of my wife or</v>

548
00:25:52.741 --> 00:25:55.620
<v Speaker 6>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the family that I was born into that</v>

549
00:25:55.621 --> 00:26:00.360
<v Speaker 6>have never apologized about anything</v>
<v Speaker 6>because they come from a cultural</v>

550
00:26:00.361 --> 00:26:03.780
<v Speaker 6>landscape where to apologize to your</v>
<v Speaker 6>child,</v>

551
00:26:03.781 --> 00:26:07.440
<v Speaker 6>to somebody younger is to lose face at</v>
<v Speaker 6>parent is always right.</v>

552
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.200
<v Speaker 6>And I mean that might work when you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>too,</v>

553
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.680
<v Speaker 6>but when you're both now adults,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you sort of have to get out of</v>

554
00:26:13.681 --> 00:26:16.350
<v Speaker 6>that and realized that we all make</v>
<v Speaker 6>mistakes and we all have to own up to</v>

555
00:26:16.351 --> 00:26:18.540
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I want to see me get beat the fuck</v>

556
00:26:18.541 --> 00:26:19.980
<v Speaker 6>up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just jamie.</v>

557
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.780
<v Speaker 6>Jamie shown a video of me about to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>my ass kicked by nick diaz</v>

558
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.050
<v Speaker 9>are you get destroyed really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I would imagine if the game is</v>

559
00:26:28.051 --> 00:26:31.140
<v Speaker 9>realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 9>fill it up and I get fucked up.</v>

560
00:26:31.141 --> 00:26:34.620
<v Speaker 9>People want to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But they might have used the ceo's</v>

561
00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.970
<v Speaker 9>secret character.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They might have.</v>

562
00:26:35.971 --> 00:26:39.000
<v Speaker 9>You got some bullshit skills.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Might have you juiced up.</v>

563
00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.590
<v Speaker 9>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Doesn't matter.</v>

<v Speaker 9>Let's hear mike because you know I'm</v>

565

<v Speaker 9>super casual fan.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So my commentary.</v>

566
00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.370
<v Speaker 9>No.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Rather with the leg kick.</v>

567
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:48.850
<v Speaker 9>I've never heard this before.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh.</v>

568
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.900
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we're all good with the leg kicks.</v>

569
00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.820
<v Speaker 9>Rogan get kicked in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh good.</v>

570
00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.250
<v Speaker 9>With the kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Diaz is back it up.</v>

571
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.250
<v Speaker 9>Rogan missed.</v>
<v Speaker 9>oh really?</v>

572
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.270
<v Speaker 9>Kicked in the chest.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Tattoos.</v>

573
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:01.800
<v Speaker 9>Accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Look at that.</v>

574
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:07.730
<v Speaker 10>And a lot of scientology training in</v>
<v Speaker 10>terms of what it imparts to people is a</v>

575
00:27:07.871 --> 00:27:10.170
<v Speaker 10>quality of being,</v>
<v Speaker 10>direct,</v>

576
00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:11.790
<v Speaker 10>being assertive,</v>
<v Speaker 10>being confident,</v>

577
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:14.730
<v Speaker 10>being in charge,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and being okay with sort of dominating</v>

578
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:18.240
<v Speaker 10>the situations that you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It'S one of the reasons that I think it</v>

579
00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:21.030
<v Speaker 10>appeals a lot to act as because it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it,</v>

580
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:22.981
<v Speaker 10>it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it works,</v>

581
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:25.920
<v Speaker 10>I think for people who have any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 10>insecurity or who are going into</v>

582
00:27:25.921 --> 00:27:30.921
<v Speaker 10>situations of uncertainty and it allows</v>
<v Speaker 10>you to almost reprogrammed your circuits</v>

583
00:27:31.681 --> 00:27:36.681
<v Speaker 10>in some way and be okay about using</v>
<v Speaker 10>assertive body language and speech and</v>

584
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:42.240
<v Speaker 10>it also imparts a sense that you have</v>
<v Speaker 10>all the truett's necessary to save</v>

585
00:27:42.241 --> 00:27:45.120
<v Speaker 10>humanity from itself.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Not just humanity on earth,</v>

586
00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:50.121
<v Speaker 10>but throughout time and space,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and it is your obligation to ensure that</v>

587
00:27:50.161 --> 00:27:53.190
<v Speaker 10>those truths are saved,</v>
<v Speaker 10>saved for posterity,</v>

588
00:27:53.191 --> 00:27:58.050
<v Speaker 10>and communicated as widely as possible</v>
<v Speaker 10>in a totally unadulterated fashion</v>

589
00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:02.850
<v Speaker 10>because any adulteration of the message</v>
<v Speaker 10>means that not only do they not work,</v>

590
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.270
<v Speaker 10>they become toxic and dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Is it good?</v>

591
00:28:05.271 --> 00:28:05.540
<v Speaker 10>Good.</v>

592
00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.640
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me try something that give it a go.</v>

593
00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.280
<v Speaker 1>What do you do with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a little bump.</v>

594
00:28:10.281 --> 00:28:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Put it under your lip bump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little pinch cocaine style bump.</v>

595
00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Now we've never done that either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go less and less asked.</v>

596
00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Plenty for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that too much?</v>

597
00:28:19.611 --> 00:28:20.540
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

598
00:28:20.541 --> 00:28:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Where do you put it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anywhere you put any love you want,</v>

599
00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.710
<v Speaker 1>it's start to burn a little cranky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cancer or immediately?</v>

600
00:28:27.711 --> 00:28:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean now you shouldn't.</v>

601
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I get messages every day from people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lost 100 pounds.</v>

602
00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feeling healthy.</v>

603
00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.520
<v Speaker 1>The problem is we're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda and you can do one or two</v>

604
00:28:40.521 --> 00:28:42.380
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

663
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.530
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two giant inspirations.</v>

664
00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:14.690
<v Speaker 1>First my wife second anniversary today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to say hi to her.</v>

665
00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.600
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a comedian I love.</v>

666
00:31:17.601 --> 00:31:19.670
<v Speaker 1>He's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant fat guy just like me,</v>

667
00:31:19.671 --> 00:31:20.504
<v Speaker 1>bert chrysler,</v>

668
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.540
<v Speaker 6>he's still way bigger than I am.</v>
<v Speaker 6>MaYbe this fire him now explain that.</v>

669
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.910
<v Speaker 6>Why do you think they did that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think they did that?</v>

670
00:31:30.911 --> 00:31:35.490
<v Speaker 6>Because if they overturn your case,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they can somehow or another because</v>

671
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.120
<v Speaker 6>they don't want to check.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But is that it or is that discrediting</v>

672
00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:42.880
<v Speaker 6>you in like that was a gigantic hit</v>
<v Speaker 6>movie.</v>

673
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:45.640
<v Speaker 6>But if they decide,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they can discredit you,</v>

674
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:49.210
<v Speaker 6>it makes that movie still valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not only that,</v>

675
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:51.670
<v Speaker 6>it stops me from running for president</v>
<v Speaker 6>donut.</v>

676
00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.400
<v Speaker 6>If they can discredit me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you want to run for president?</v>

677
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:58.130
<v Speaker 6>I thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even living in Mexico from Mexico would</v>

678
00:31:58.131 --> 00:32:01.180
<v Speaker 6>have had to forsake of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why I didn't do it.</v>

679
00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:02.591
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

680
00:32:02.591 --> 00:32:04.690
<v Speaker 6>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the reason why you didn't run for</v>

681
00:32:04.691 --> 00:32:07.210
<v Speaker 6>president because you would have to have</v>
<v Speaker 6>forsaken live in New Mexico.</v>

682
00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.720
<v Speaker 6>Now I might fucking when I know.</v>

683
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.950
<v Speaker 6>I figured I could have one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

684
00:32:11.951 --> 00:32:15.340
<v Speaker 6>The libertarians contacted me twice to</v>
<v Speaker 6>come to their convention.</v>

685
00:32:15.341 --> 00:32:17.810

<v Speaker 6>Come back to America.</v>

686
00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:21.640
<v Speaker 6>Com.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ken and I chose not to do it because I</v>

687

<v Speaker 6>was up for the campaigning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was up to taking on,</v>

<v Speaker 6>when you get one of them jobs like</v>

700
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.010
<v Speaker 6>Is that why I'm trying to scrape</v>
<v Speaker 6>together rent?</v>

701
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.550
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can aggressive.</v>

702
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.680
<v Speaker 6>Very aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These guys.</v>

703
00:33:15.681 --> 00:33:19.990
<v Speaker 6>Prestige or fame and attention.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's the bandwagon effect and crowd</v>

704
00:33:19.991 --> 00:33:22.520
<v Speaker 6>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then there are people and entities.</v>

705
00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:23.151
<v Speaker 6>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but wait,</v>

706
00:33:23.151 --> 00:33:23.451
<v Speaker 6>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait,</v>

707
00:33:23.451 --> 00:33:24.290
<v Speaker 6>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait.</v>

708
00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:29.180
<v Speaker 6>The bandwagon effect and the and crowd</v>
<v Speaker 6>behavior like flat earth bullshit.</v>

709
00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:33.050
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're only seven minutes and 53 seconds</v>

710
00:33:33.051 --> 00:33:34.810
<v Speaker 6>into a 29 minute video.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>

711
00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:38.190
<v Speaker 6>But I have a feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

712
00:33:38.191 --> 00:33:39.450
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know for sure,</v>

713
00:33:39.451 --> 00:33:43.110
<v Speaker 6>but my guess would be that if you wanted</v>
<v Speaker 6>to find people who said,</v>

714
00:33:43.111 --> 00:33:44.610
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>trump grabbed my pussy,</v>

715
00:33:44.611 --> 00:33:48.230
<v Speaker 6>it wouldn't be that fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not like you're looking for bigfoot</v>

716
00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:57.210
<v Speaker 6>pretty easy to have them be my guess.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

717
00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:00.210
<v Speaker 6>But so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it wasn't like a hard thing to do.</v>

718
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.300
<v Speaker 6>It's a bread crumb trail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It very simple,</v>

719
00:34:03.301 --> 00:34:06.060
<v Speaker 6>very easy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so it's like when you realize like</v>

720
00:34:06.061 --> 00:34:07.590
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you start feeling this weird</v>

721
00:34:07.591 --> 00:34:09.810
<v Speaker 6>compassion for him and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my god.</v>

722
00:34:09.811 --> 00:34:13.650
<v Speaker 6>Even with all his like maliciousness and</v>
<v Speaker 6>like weird pervasiveness and stuff.</v>

723
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.140
<v Speaker 6>Ultimately he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

724
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:19.500
<v Speaker 6>he's like a fucking bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They got put into a god damn ring with a</v>

725
00:34:19.501 --> 00:34:22.430
<v Speaker 6>matador.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's been doing this kind of bull</v>

726
00:34:22.431 --> 00:34:26.250
<v Speaker 6>fighting for like 30 fucking years for</v>
<v Speaker 6>better or for worse.</v>

727
00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:30.300
<v Speaker 6>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're watching what we saw last night I</v>

728
00:34:30.301 --> 00:34:31.040
<v Speaker 6>guess.</v>

729
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.080
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big part of what's interesting about</v>

730
00:34:34.081 --> 00:34:39.081
<v Speaker 2>it is he came really close to women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's still in the neighborhood of</v>

731
00:34:39.391 --> 00:34:44.391
<v Speaker 2>winning plus or minus 11 points or would</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means is between now and how many</v>

732
00:34:45.001 --> 00:34:47.340
<v Speaker 2>days do we have until the election is 21</v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

733
00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of crazy shit can happen in 21 days</v>

734
00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.630
<v Speaker 2>to shift people's opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but apparently again from all those</v>

735
00:34:55.631 --> 00:34:57.480
<v Speaker 2>stats now look man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to get.</v>

736
00:34:57.481 --> 00:34:59.820
<v Speaker 2>I tried to say any of that stuff because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know if it's true.</v>

737
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:04.050
<v Speaker 2>They're all just talking on tv and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>brainwash and all of us to let us think</v>

738
00:35:04.051 --> 00:35:08.340
<v Speaker 2>that they know who the is voting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if she knows how to be just</v>

739
00:35:08.341 --> 00:35:09.540
<v Speaker 2>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

740
00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My problem with hillary is,</v>

741
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:13.110
<v Speaker 2>is purely an operational one.</v>

742
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:17.310
<v Speaker 2>I know that if I had handled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean even in the conservative way,</v>

743
00:35:17.311 --> 00:35:20.370
<v Speaker 2>if you look at what she did with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>email server and her colleagues or</v>

744
00:35:20.371 --> 00:35:23.040
<v Speaker 2>cohorts did and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

745
00:35:23.041 --> 00:35:23.874
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

746
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:25.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a conservative way.</v>

747
00:35:25.651 --> 00:35:29.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at at how bad it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I had done that,</v>

748
00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:34.100
<v Speaker 2>I would have been sent to prison and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know because we had various counter</v>

749
00:35:34.351 --> 00:35:38.430
<v Speaker 2>intelligence operations and alto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to find the lake,</v>

750
00:35:38.431 --> 00:35:42.690
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to find the problem and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you watch people get banged up for less</v>

751
00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:44.880
<v Speaker 2>egregious acts and then what she's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in.</v>

752
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:48.390
<v Speaker 2>So my problem with hillary is looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>one set of rules for everybody.</v>

753
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.290
<v Speaker 1>The system is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is broken in that respect,</v>

754
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.480
<v Speaker 1>but given the choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

755
00:35:54.481 --> 00:35:58.560
<v Speaker 1>and when you have a choice between</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who is for all her flaws,</v>

756
00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:04.930
<v Speaker 1>been in the game for long enough to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>really well informed and capable of</v>

757
00:36:05.251 --> 00:36:07.760
<v Speaker 1>compromise and capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

758
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.230
<v Speaker 1>not just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

759
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.110
<v Speaker 1>just</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking</v>

760
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:18.420
<v Speaker 1>the entire machine and you have someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's just,</v>

761
00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:22.670
<v Speaker 1>he could just kind of stepped off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>set of his reality tv show and then he</v>

762
00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:27.690
<v Speaker 1>lied about everything and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an elbowed his way onto your television</v>

763
00:36:28.321 --> 00:36:30.730
<v Speaker 1>set and never left because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

764
00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:34.290
<v Speaker 1>cnn couldn't figure out how to give the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mic to someone else.</v>

765
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

766
00:36:36.571 --> 00:36:37.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

767
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a product of attention because they</v>

768
00:36:40.321 --> 00:36:43.020
<v Speaker 1>realize that there's a heated race</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

769
00:36:43.021 --> 00:36:45.450
<v Speaker 1>The heated race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy was really famous and in a</v>

770
00:36:45.451 --> 00:36:48.180
<v Speaker 1>heated race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy would say some crazy stuff and</v>

771
00:36:48.181 --> 00:36:50.700
<v Speaker 1>so they would tune into them so</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody had to do an intro.</v>

772
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:54.120
<v Speaker 1>So because of him saying crazy stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he accelerated the amount they were</v>

773
00:36:54.121 --> 00:36:56.520
<v Speaker 1>talking about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're constantly talking about him</v>

774
00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.680
<v Speaker 1>and barely talking about other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>

775
00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:03.030
<v Speaker 1>But he's created a warm hOle in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>political process now where there's</v>

776
00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:07.720
<v Speaker 1>nothing so crazy that could disqualify</v>
<v Speaker 1>him among the people who liked him to so</v>

777
00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:12.810
<v Speaker 1>he can just keep it just like nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs of craziness that the press can't</v>

778
00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:16.900
<v Speaker 1>ignore that the every time they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

779
00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:19.420
<v Speaker 1>this is the crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it's Going to harm his</v>

780
00:37:19.421 --> 00:37:21.190
<v Speaker 1>candidacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's shine a light on it.</v>

781
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.500
<v Speaker 1>It just helps him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

782
00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:24.430
<v Speaker 1>he could just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could,</v>

783
00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.200
<v Speaker 1>he could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could get on twitter right now and</v>

784
00:37:26.201 --> 00:37:27.210
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know who I'd like to fuck,</v>

785
00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to fuck nikki minaj and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would work for him.</v>

786
00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.640
<v Speaker 1>It was work for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would see or use a tweet storm of a</v>

787
00:37:37.641 --> 00:37:40.970
<v Speaker 1>billion people who say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to fuck nikki minaj to go get</v>

788
00:37:40.971 --> 00:37:43.910
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's insanity.</v>

789
00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:44.900
<v Speaker 1>That's where we are.</v>

790
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.970
<v Speaker 2>When people said that was a trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>supporter,</v>

791
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:52.770
<v Speaker 2>what they meant was they may have only</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen part of what I was talking about.</v>

792
00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I was writing about his skill as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>persuader and what I mean is that I</v>

793
00:37:58.381 --> 00:38:03.210
<v Speaker 2>noticed in him the skills that I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed over decades for persuasion,</v>

794
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.330
<v Speaker 2>but at a higher level than I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>

795
00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:11.690
<v Speaker 2>Meaning that he is the most persuasive</v>
<v Speaker 2>living human I've ever experienced.</v>

796
00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.600
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like trump kind of kicked her</v>

797
00:38:16.601 --> 00:38:20.950
<v Speaker 3>ass to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty fucking weird.</v>

<v Speaker 1>such a beautiful night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was probably the most fun I've ever</v>

804

<v Speaker 1>had on a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

807
00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:55.290

<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever laughed any</v>

<v Speaker 1>like burr had me laughing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>trump tweets him at 1:30 in the morning.</v>

812
00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:10.520
<v Speaker 3>Little jon stewart is a pussy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and would be hopeless in a debate with</v>

813
00:39:10.521 --> 00:39:11.690
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't even do that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could go up and say,</v>

862
00:41:41.481 --> 00:41:44.780

863
00:41:44.781 --> 00:41:49.670
<v Speaker 12>people have one opportunity and other</v>
<v Speaker 12>people have many opportunities and</v>

864
00:41:49.671 --> 00:41:50.810
<v Speaker 12>that's the difference.</v>

865

884
00:42:42.981 --> 00:42:45.440

<v Speaker 6>I'm wanting to commit suicide and now</v>

885
00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:46.670
<v Speaker 6>I'm walking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everywhere I go,</v>

886
00:42:46.671 --> 00:42:50.420
<v Speaker 6>people are going to</v>
<v Speaker 6>miss this.</v>

887
00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:52.760
<v Speaker 6>This is a sign that I'm back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're back.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'm back chat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's go chat.</v>

889
00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.470
<v Speaker 6>Thank you everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was beautiful that you can share.</v>

890
00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:04.690
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't expect any support from my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my colleagues and.</v>

891
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.880
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't that I don't care if I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

892
00:43:07.881 --> 00:43:10.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in some sense it's irrelevant.</v>

893
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:15.290
<v Speaker 1>It's irrelevant to me because my goal</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

894
00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:21.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying those god damn pronouns</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I'm not saying them is</v>

895
00:43:21.261 --> 00:43:26.060
<v Speaker 1>because they're made up by left wing</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologues and I don't like left wing</v>

896
00:43:26.061 --> 00:43:31.061
<v Speaker 1>ideology ideology period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know where corruption of speech</v>

897
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:38.090
<v Speaker 1>leads and I'm not goIng there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's just talk about what happened.</v>

898
00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:38.400
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

899
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:43.400
<v Speaker 6>tested positive for some</v>
<v Speaker 6>estrogen inhibitors as blockers</v>

900
00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.880
<v Speaker 6>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and blockers that a lot of people</v>

901
00:43:47.881 --> 00:43:50.910
<v Speaker 6>associate with people who take steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're talking about john.</v>

902
00:43:50.911 --> 00:43:55.860
<v Speaker 6>This whole thing is going out with john</v>
<v Speaker 6>based on a test that took place on June</v>

903
00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.960
<v Speaker 6>16th.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The reason that relevant when I went</v>

00:44:04.201 --> 00:44:08.160
<v Speaker 6>They don't help you that they're silly.</v>

<v Speaker 6>something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He tested positive for two estrogen.</v>

922
00:44:38.461 --> 00:44:40.740
<v Speaker 2>cialis and so I thought it was a cialis</v>

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:05.040
<v Speaker 2>the medical results until like it gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>released.</v>

931
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:06.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

932
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to plead ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

933
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:11.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll plead ignorance all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might own name.</v>

934
00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:13.380
<v Speaker 2>I think he probably took boner pills</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's.</v>

935
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:14.820
<v Speaker 2>They have all that shit in them.</v>

936

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have potent pills,</v>

937
00:45:16.291 --> 00:45:18.910
<v Speaker 2>have steroids in them always hitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

938
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Because I just found that at joe's gas</v>
<v Speaker 2>station over here,</v>

939
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:28.110
<v Speaker 2>it has like the best I've never seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>these right on is known for his love of</v>

940
00:45:28.111 --> 00:45:30.210
<v Speaker 2>the boner pill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He means what you would call a boner</v>

941
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:34.140
<v Speaker 2>pill contour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's actually read blogs about boner</v>

942
00:45:34.141 --> 00:45:37.440
<v Speaker 2>pills and directed me to reviews of</v>
<v Speaker 2>boner pills.</v>

943
00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean these things have steroids in</v>

944
00:45:41.281 --> 00:45:42.750
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a bunch of stuff and if you</v>

945
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.540
<v Speaker 2>party wasn't the last thing he got</v>
<v Speaker 2>busted for cocaine or something.</v>

946
00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:47.150
<v Speaker 2>If you bus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do cocaine,</v>

947
00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.970
<v Speaker 2>lot of guys take these because you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get hard off of having cocaine and so if</v>

<v Speaker 2>be tempered a little too much.</v>
