1
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Three you started at three to ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tricky</v>

2
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.350
<v Speaker 2>and we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi Julie.</v>

3
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's happening?</v>

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.930
<v Speaker 2>We were just talking before this podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>started at a year.</v>

5
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:21.890
<v Speaker 2>We were working on your masters in </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonfiction,</v>

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>shin creative writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative nonfiction.</v>

7
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.610
<v Speaker 1>What does creative nonfiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's that work?</v>

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.713
<v Speaker 1>It's actually very encompassing of a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things to think about like memoir or </v>

9
00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>biography essays especially where a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of Sas,</v>

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.330
<v Speaker 1>we're a bunch of nerds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pick about I think nine or 10 of us</v>

11
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>out of a group of 150 for this program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

12
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:43.584
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we write a ton of essays and we read so </v>

13
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.820
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how many female MMA </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters,</v>

15
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:50.654
<v Speaker 2>not that this is a knock against male </v>
<v Speaker 2>mma fighters are like really fucking </v>

16
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:55.810
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Rosie Sexton,</v>

17
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

18
00:00:58.161 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 2>there's a ton of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go down the list.</v>

19
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peggy Morgan,</v>

20
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>she's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

21
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.730
<v Speaker 1>the really intelligent female fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

22
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.803
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something with mma and </v>

23
00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:07.904
<v Speaker 1>creativity and I think whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the opportunities maybe haven't </v>

24
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:13.460
<v Speaker 1>been out there for women as much when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to like,</v>

25
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.790
<v Speaker 1>I guess finding an avenue for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity there,</v>

26
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go into other things like academics</v>

27
00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:22.640
<v Speaker 1>and arts and then they find mma and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to do both.</v>

28
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.290
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

29
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:25.124
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's probably a bunch of </v>

30
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roxanne metaphoric.</v>

31
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.790
<v Speaker 2>That's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's super smart.</v>

32
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.560
<v Speaker 2>I always wonder if it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's such an odd thing,</v>

33
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.450
<v Speaker 2>especially when you started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.490
<v Speaker 2>you're a real pioneer in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

35
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:39.980
<v Speaker 2>you fought Gina Carano in 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago,</v>

36
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 2>long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy when you think about it.</v>

37
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:45.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mma was like nonexistent in the public's</v>

38
00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:46.784
<v Speaker 2>fear back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just wasn't something that people </v>

39
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:48.674
<v Speaker 2>talked about for women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the women that did get into it and </v>

40
00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 2>it reached like a professional level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to be like extremely danger.</v>

41
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Daring you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

42
00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:58.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a kind of a crazy occupation.</v>

43
00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.030
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

44
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that those of us who started</v>

45
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:02.691
<v Speaker 1>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

46
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:03.524
<v Speaker 1>I'm not knocking the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it now because there are </v>

47
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:06.140
<v Speaker 1>tremendous athletes and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:06.974
<v Speaker 1>the women going into it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the environment was such that you </v>

49
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:11.270
<v Speaker 1>had to be really obsessive and I'm sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

50
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many other female athletes at this time </v>

51
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.750
<v Speaker 1>have that kind of obsessive streak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think at that time,</v>

52
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:18.441
<v Speaker 1>because we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

53
00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:19.274
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd scour the internet like mma </v>

54
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:20.960
<v Speaker 1>underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

55
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.780
<v Speaker 1>I was always looking for fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was always trying to find somebody to</v>

56
00:02:23.781 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 1>find me or the shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>og forums,</v>

57
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:28.690
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff before it got kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

58
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.740
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

59
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

60
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.083
<v Speaker 1>who wants to fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he wants to fight me and somebody </v>

61
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:32.541
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to fight you.</v>

62
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:32.961
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

63
00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:33.740
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so,</v>

64
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm so grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird atmosphere back then.</v>

65
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

66
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was people doing it just for the pure</v>

67
00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:41.200
<v Speaker 2>passion of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

68
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.570
<v Speaker 2>I got to talk to Jeremy Horn about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

69
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:48.130
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy I think has had 150 pro fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something crazy like that.</v>

70
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.353
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to realize like back then we </v>

71
00:02:50.981 --> 00:02:52.930
<v Speaker 2>were doing it because we wanted to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

72
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.973
<v Speaker 2>It would no one was thinking that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to be an avenue for you to be </v>

73
00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:58.580
<v Speaker 2>the next condom or greg or the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ronda Rousey.</v>

74
00:02:58.581 --> 00:02:59.414
<v Speaker 2>I mean it didn't,</v>

75
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.450
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

76
00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:01.020
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

77
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.600
<v Speaker 3>my very first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

78
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.773
<v Speaker 3>they videotaped me was for Jeff Osborne </v>
<v Speaker 3>and who can shoot and the video taping </v>

79
00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:07.200
<v Speaker 3>this and what do you want to do at this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

80
00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:08.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be in the UFC.</v>

81
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.340
<v Speaker 3>And that was 2004 there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody laughed at me.</v>

82
00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:11.701
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

83
00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:13.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just watch me.</v>

84
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.960
<v Speaker 3>I actually can't believe I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

85
00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:17.220
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was my goal.</v>

86
00:03:17.221 --> 00:03:17.641
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

87
00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:19.050
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do well on the UFC,</v>

88
00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:21.360
<v Speaker 3>but it got there you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I check that one off.</v>

89
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.250
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

90
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.113
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't about being that superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was about where you would get to </v>

91
00:03:27.571 --> 00:03:28.440
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

92
00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:29.730
<v Speaker 3>what would you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would get to do.</v>

93
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.623
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just getting to fight with such a </v>

94
00:03:32.701 --> 00:03:33.960
<v Speaker 3>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

95
00:03:33.961 --> 00:03:35.280
<v Speaker 3>just the ABS.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a fight.</v>

96
00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:36.960
<v Speaker 3>The excitement you would have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I have a fight.</v>

97
00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:37.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is great.</v>

98
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.013
<v Speaker 2>That's a crazy feeling to try to explain</v>
<v Speaker 2>to someone that has never done anything </v>

99
00:03:44.511 --> 00:03:46.970
<v Speaker 2>remotely as dangerous as competing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>MMA.</v>

100
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.120
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to explain that to someone.</v>

101
00:03:50.121 --> 00:03:50.954
<v Speaker 2>Like if you were talking to some woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a doctor or a professor or a just </v>

102
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.040
<v Speaker 2>normal job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.110
<v Speaker 2>those aren't the most normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't tell him.</v>

104
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.983
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying if you were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>explain to someone what you want to </v>

105
00:04:05.181 --> 00:04:06.350
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you want,</v>

106
00:04:06.351 --> 00:04:07.184
<v Speaker 2>you're looking forward to something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to make you terribly </v>

107
00:04:09.171 --> 00:04:10.004
<v Speaker 2>nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably going to want to throw </v>

108
00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:14.030
<v Speaker 2>up right before you go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be freaking out and then</v>

109
00:04:14.031 --> 00:04:15.320
<v Speaker 2>finally going to be in there doing it.</v>

110
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:16.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

111
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.380
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's really,</v>

112
00:04:18.381 --> 00:04:19.760
<v Speaker 3>it's difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to explain,</v>

113
00:04:19.761 --> 00:04:20.594
<v Speaker 3>I guess maybe ultra marathon runners or </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody of that kind of different </v>

114
00:04:23.571 --> 00:04:26.660
<v Speaker 3>sphere of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of expression would maybe understand it.</v>

115
00:04:26.661 --> 00:04:28.580
<v Speaker 3>What you want to run a hundred miles in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the desert or whatever.</v>

116
00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:29.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's,</v>

117
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.090
<v Speaker 3>there's an extreme him and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that,</v>

118
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lays pretty dormant,</v>

119
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.323
<v Speaker 3>but when you get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you find an avenue for it and you </v>

120
00:04:37.821 --> 00:04:38.654
<v Speaker 3>get to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes so addictive and you just </v>

121
00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:40.970
<v Speaker 3>want to keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want,</v>

122
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 3>you can't stop doing it.</v>

123
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.373
<v Speaker 2>Do you also kind of take comfort in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that she's just a few of you out </v>

124
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:49.110
<v Speaker 2>there like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I've been really getting it,</v>

125
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:49.944
<v Speaker 2>this is a really strange thing to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with because I'm not really </v>

126
00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:53.540
<v Speaker 2>going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

127
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm obsessed with these people that hike</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the country.</v>

128
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I'm talking to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the Appalachian trail?</v>

129
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having this guy on who has completed</v>

130
00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:05.970
<v Speaker 2>the Appalachian trail and I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm obsessed with these people.</v>

131
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.730
<v Speaker 2>They cut their toothbrushes in half to </v>
<v Speaker 2>save weight.</v>

132
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.780
<v Speaker 2>Like they were one piece of clothing for</v>
<v Speaker 2>like six months.</v>

133
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.000
<v Speaker 2>Like it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They bring water filters,</v>

134
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:17.880
<v Speaker 2>they can find creeks and drink out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>water and they,</v>

135
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:18.743
<v Speaker 2>these are educated people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>college degrees and they just want to </v>

136
00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:23.520
<v Speaker 2>see if they can walk from Georgia to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Maine.</v>

137
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.900
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

138
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.473
<v Speaker 3>everybody has that in them to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>extent where they just have to push </v>

139
00:05:29.181 --> 00:05:31.580
<v Speaker 3>themselves in some direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although,</v>

140
00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:32.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to those long hikes,</v>

141
00:05:32.961 --> 00:05:35.690
<v Speaker 3>I've also heard from people who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>failed at the Appalachian trail.</v>

142
00:05:35.691 --> 00:05:36.524
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after a certain point you're just </v>

143
00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:40.040
<v Speaker 3>putting one foot in front of the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't mean anything anymore.</v>

144
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.940
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that there's also that,</v>

145
00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:43.850
<v Speaker 3>that sense of burnout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those people with that,</v>

146
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.833
<v Speaker 3>that drive to do something with passion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is the perfect word for it that </v>

147
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.070
<v Speaker 3>just want to push beyond what they know </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a different sphere.</v>

148
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.383
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is it does become addictive </v>

149
00:05:54.441 --> 00:05:56.930
<v Speaker 3>and your body or your mind can't always </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep up with it.</v>

150
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a thing</v>

151
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.053
<v Speaker 2>that happens to people when they become </v>
<v Speaker 2>addicted to things where it overwhelms </v>

152
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes all consuming.</v>

153
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:05.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

154
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 2>so you're all consuming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thing is trying to run.</v>

155
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 2>You did a hundred miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you got to run 200 miles like,</v>

156
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:10.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

157
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be faster this time.</v>

158
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you've got to win.</v>

159
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.073
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a strange compulsion to push </v>

160
00:06:18.271 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 2>yourself to almost like experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

161
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like regular life in its </v>
<v Speaker 2>placid.</v>

162
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Vibration is frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

163
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not enough,</v>

164
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 2>there's not enough tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough excitement.</v>

165
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough you need like,</v>

166
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.500
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

167
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.720
<v Speaker 1>that's how we settled a new world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

168
00:06:37.721 --> 00:06:40.570
<v Speaker 1>That's how like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how mountains are,</v>

169
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.920
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are climbed.</v>

170
00:06:41.921 --> 00:06:42.754
<v Speaker 1>Our summative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how we get to space is because </v>

171
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.330
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something in human nature that's</v>

172
00:06:46.331 --> 00:06:49.210
<v Speaker 1>so precious that you just have to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing it.</v>

173
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a collective feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

174
00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:51.514
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some individuals out there who </v>

175
00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:52.894
<v Speaker 1>just stand a little bit apart or just an</v>
<v Speaker 1>a maybe a different playground and they </v>

176
00:06:56.321 --> 00:06:57.154
<v Speaker 1>just want to keep pushing and pushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pushing and they want to be the </v>

177
00:06:58.631 --> 00:07:00.700
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we achieve.</v>

178
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 2>The thing about mma though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you have to,</v>

179
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.543
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance that pushing with preserving </v>

180
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.293
<v Speaker 2>your physical health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially someone who's as smart as </v>

181
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:10.784
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gotta be an interesting sort of an </v>

182
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.490
<v Speaker 2>act of balancing act because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

183
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

184
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 1>excuse me for talking real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>

185
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always get all excited and talk.</v>

186
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

187
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my body's a rack now.</v>

188
00:07:21.711 --> 00:07:22.544
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I could ever compete in </v>

189
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:25.220
<v Speaker 1>MMA again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

190
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my neck is out.</v>

191
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.193
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had shoulder surgery in 2012 and </v>

192
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 1>something happened with my neck and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>never healed correctly.</v>

193
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:33.230
<v Speaker 1>So what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

194
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I've never getting Mris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.</v>

195
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't like being in a tube like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me really nervous.</v>

196
00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 1>So you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

197
00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:41.270
<v Speaker 1>so I just deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

198
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:42.800
<v Speaker 1>just massage and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

199
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

200
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:45.620
<v Speaker 1>my knees are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are pretty bad.</v>

201
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I get SCIATICA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I understand that I don't,</v>

202
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.363
<v Speaker 1>I retired kind of young I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I understood that it was the time I </v>

203
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 1>need it to because things were not going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to function in my body on the level that</v>

204
00:07:56.571 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 1>they needed to.</v>

205
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.870
<v Speaker 1>And my mind wasn't in a place where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would push beyond that.</v>

206
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.580
<v Speaker 1>When you competed professionally for </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

207
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:02.450
<v Speaker 1>10 years more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

208
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.570
<v Speaker 1>nine years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

209
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was,</v>

210
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing martial arts since I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

211
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.590
<v Speaker 1>so that's a lot of years and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of years.</v>

212
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 1>That's 32 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

213
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.660
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like actually competing.</v>

214
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Like I knew that that wasn't giving me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that at my last fight,</v>

215
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:21.230
<v Speaker 1>like before I walked out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told Greg Jackson,</v>

216
00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:21.711
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

217
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:23.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

218
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.380
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>

219
00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:25.214
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he going to try it before you went </v>

220
00:08:25.941 --> 00:08:26.541
<v Speaker 1>out there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

221
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I was so sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

222
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had food poisoning.</v>

223
00:08:28.991 --> 00:08:30.650
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was when I fought batchko hair.</v>

224
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.993
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

225
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

226
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:34.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stressing about batch rolling your yell </v>

227
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.193
<v Speaker 1>a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

228
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.303
<v Speaker 1>Know there's always that you always had </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing where it's like I won that </v>

229
00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:40.640
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

230
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

231
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.163
<v Speaker 1>Throw me a bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won that fight and stop wiggling your </v>

232
00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:44.060
<v Speaker 1>butt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

233
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.640
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She does her thing.</v>

234
00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:49.400
<v Speaker 1>She's been very successful with the </v>

<v Speaker 1>Just outside of Indianapolis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Albuquerque is a,</v>

294
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:46.443
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you're moving to some like</v>
<v Speaker 1>boulder or even looking at the rocky </v>

295
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:51.380
<v Speaker 1>mountains or something.</v>

301
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a little odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an odd,</v>

302
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:03.420
<v Speaker 1>it would have been a difficult move </v>
<v Speaker 1>without the Jackson Campaign for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

309
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.070
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I did a lot of great stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my life.</v>

310
00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:17.904
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm proud of the things I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that I was also surrounded </v>

311
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:22.650
<v Speaker 1>by people who really guided me well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who really like,</v>

312
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like going back to school and stuff like</v>

313
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:26.430
<v Speaker 1>that after my career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

314
00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:27.264
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the influences of people who </v>

315
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:29.124
<v Speaker 1>were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they care about the people on their </v>

316
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:30.990
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>

317
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Speaker 1>They care about who they surround </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves with.</v>

318
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.980
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't know any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of showed up.</v>

319
00:11:34.981 --> 00:11:35.850
<v Speaker 1>And first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

320
00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 1>I drive to the gym and Greg says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

321
00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:40.260
<v Speaker 1>follow me back to my place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And immediately I back into the dumpster</v>

322
00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:43.620
<v Speaker 1>at the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a total Klutz.</v>

323
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

324
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.223
<v Speaker 1>he came out to Russia with me for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and I want to impress him because </v>

325
00:11:49.771 --> 00:11:51.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize until it was in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gym,</v>

326
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:51.720
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

327
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.590
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be like my sense I like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>

328
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>this</v>

329
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:54.903
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a Samurai and this is like </v>

330
00:11:56.471 --> 00:11:57.304
<v Speaker 3>the person I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot what that relationship is </v>

331
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:01.630
<v Speaker 3>called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the person I really want to lead</v>

332
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:02.464
<v Speaker 3>me and guide me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's my leader and I wanted to impress </v>

333
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:06.910
<v Speaker 3>him so badly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that fight,</v>

334
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:07.744
<v Speaker 3>first thing she does right away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was against Yulia bears a coveage </v>

335
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.680
<v Speaker 3>first thing she does punch me in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nose,</v>

336
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:13.210
<v Speaker 3>just shatters my nose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood everywhere.</v>

337
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.021
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

338
00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:14.854
<v Speaker 3>this is again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was right after the Toronto </v>

339
00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:16.714
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like I was used to losing </v>

340
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:18.154
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you never want to get in that space </v>

341
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:21.970
<v Speaker 3>of being used to losing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But somehow I clicked and you know,</v>

342
00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:22.804
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did pretty well in the fight and I </v>

343
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:26.770
<v Speaker 3>ended up getting a mounted triangle on </v>
<v Speaker 3>her and finishing with strikes.</v>

344
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.320
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in between rounds,</v>

345
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.393
<v Speaker 3>another corner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men put cold water in the back of my </v>

346
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:34.720
<v Speaker 3>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought that I just started,</v>

347
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.530
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a Fart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

348
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.290
<v Speaker 4>turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this poor girl mounted triangle,</v>

349
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.500
<v Speaker 4>no less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this poor girl,</v>

350
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.600
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

351
00:12:45.601 --> 00:12:47.040
<v Speaker 4>So they grab us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they put us on his bus,</v>

352
00:12:47.041 --> 00:12:47.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm still in my</v>

353
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.400
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>closes of blood,</v>

354
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:49.234
<v Speaker 3>can limit gloves on and they just put us</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a bus separate me and Amanda Buckner </v>

355
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:52.564
<v Speaker 3>from our corner men and everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we'd want our fights and they </v>

356
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:59.260
<v Speaker 3>take us to this palace and I cannot </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember who's pals,</v>

357
00:12:59.261 --> 00:13:00.094
<v Speaker 3>Alexander or something like it was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Saint Petersburg and it was beautiful </v>

358
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.120
<v Speaker 3>gold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

359
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 3>I was going to silk and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in my clothes and I'm like,</v>

360
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:09.250
<v Speaker 3>what is that smell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

361
00:13:09.251 --> 00:13:11.610
<v Speaker 3>I'd seen a guy puking backstage cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

362
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 3>cause of a headshot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

363
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:15.970
<v Speaker 3>I must've like rolled in it or stepped </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and I smell so bad.</v>

364
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.000
<v Speaker 3>And John Claude van Damme randomly walks</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to us.</v>

365
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:20.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

366
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.520
<v Speaker 3>bay doors here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Claude van Damme,</v>

367
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 3>this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like just weird and surreal already head</v>

368
00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:27.250
<v Speaker 3>trauma going on with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like not really in my right mind.</v>

369
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.800
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just,</v>

370
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.280
<v Speaker 3>it was so weird to be like smelling </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself and being like,</v>

371
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stepped in Puke.</v>

372
00:13:34.331 --> 00:13:37.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry Mister Van dam like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I smell so badly.</v>

373
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.153
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy too because you got </v>
<v Speaker 4>punched in the nose if you smelled it </v>

374
00:13:40.501 --> 00:13:42.800
<v Speaker 4>through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your nose is fucked up.</v>

375
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:44.873
<v Speaker 4>I remember being on the bus and looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>around going to say Miami perfume or </v>

376
00:13:47.431 --> 00:13:49.050
<v Speaker 4>anything and other people are allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>shower,</v>

377
00:13:49.051 --> 00:13:50.580
<v Speaker 4>but I was allowed to swing bat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

378
00:13:50.581 --> 00:13:51.414
<v Speaker 4>So I was right after</v>

379
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.473
<v Speaker 3>put you on a bus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't tell me where I was going and </v>

380
00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.950
<v Speaker 3>that's a good way to get staff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No kidding.</v>

381
00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.170
<v Speaker 3>It was really gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been lucky with staff,</v>

382
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.370
<v Speaker 3>but yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>

383
00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.373
<v Speaker 3>I ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

384
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.690
<v Speaker 3>going to the restroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at the shit kicked all over it.</v>

385
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.160
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>

386
00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:11.440
<v Speaker 4>it must have been in between rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's disgusting.</v>

387
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:12.543
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's no trashcan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like silk and gold in this </v>

388
00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:15.334
<v Speaker 4>beautiful palace</v>

389
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.193
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just like take my panties off and </v>

390
00:14:17.071 --> 00:14:19.200
<v Speaker 3>just like roll them up and shove him </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind the toilet.</v>

391
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.630
<v Speaker 4>Black Lace Thong Vladimir Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was mine.</v>

392
00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:25.890
<v Speaker 4>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want it back.</v>

393
00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.030
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want it back.</v>

394
00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.620
<v Speaker 3>2000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was 10 years ago and that's crap.</v>

395
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:31.450
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

396
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.283
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I just go back out there and </v>

397
00:14:33.021 --> 00:14:35.090
<v Speaker 3>it's like Berlusconi was like hitting on</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and,</v>

398
00:14:35.091 --> 00:14:35.924
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like trying to pick me up and he's </v>

399
00:14:36.711 --> 00:14:37.011
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

400
00:14:37.011 --> 00:14:38.480
<v Speaker 3>can I be your boyfriend tonight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just like,</v>

401
00:14:38.481 --> 00:14:39.270
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

402
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.090
<v Speaker 4>Sing it through a translator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was so,</v>

403
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.810
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I smell like shit.</v>

404
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.550
<v Speaker 4>Like I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>

405
00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:49.350
<v Speaker 4>you are a dirty motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Putin comes,</v>

406
00:14:49.351 --> 00:14:50.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>puts his arm around me,</v>

407
00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:51.264
<v Speaker 4>Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just like</v>

408
00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.980
<v Speaker 1>weird as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't,</v>

409
00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:54.843
<v Speaker 1>it was just like I shit myself in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of foreign dignitaries in another </v>

410
00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:58.270
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

411
00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.700
<v Speaker 1>That's probably my favorite MMA story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How surreal was it to meet booton?</v>

412
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.460
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what a big deal,</v>

413
00:15:05.461 --> 00:15:07.950
<v Speaker 1>but that's usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stumbled into things without knowing,</v>

414
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.130
<v Speaker 1>which is probably best because I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very nervous person.</v>

415
00:15:11.131 --> 00:15:11.964
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a very intense person and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>being there and just having had the </v>

416
00:15:15.091 --> 00:15:16.380
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

417
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Like when I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

418
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your hookers pissing on you thing.</v>

419
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.240
<v Speaker 4>Sorry Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then done and it's been done better.</v>

420
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.083
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

421
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow then.</v>

422
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.910
<v Speaker 1>And I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No idea.</v>

423
00:15:33.911 --> 00:15:35.280
<v Speaker 1>No idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No idea.</v>

424
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.850
<v Speaker 1>What he looked different then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

425
00:15:36.851 --> 00:15:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I was really blonde.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

426
00:15:38.111 --> 00:15:39.520
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did look different,</v>

427
00:15:39.521 --> 00:15:40.380
<v Speaker 1>didn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

428
00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

429
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.740
<v Speaker 1>That was when he had taken a break from </v>
<v Speaker 1>being the dictator,</v>

430
00:15:44.741 --> 00:15:45.281
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

431
00:15:45.281 --> 00:15:47.650
<v Speaker 1>I think he was prime minister at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time or something,</v>

432
00:15:47.651 --> 00:15:49.510
<v Speaker 1>but then he just went right back into </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

433
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

434
00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:52.110
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So strange.</v>

435
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.013
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just being in that kind of atmosphere </v>

436
00:15:54.281 --> 00:15:55.114
<v Speaker 1>and sweatpants and fight close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not going to tap out was still </v>

437
00:15:57.401 --> 00:15:58.234
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

438
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

439
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:03.730
<v Speaker 1>they put me on their show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they took such good care of me.</v>

440
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

441
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:09.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tap out stories,</v>

442
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:09.843
<v Speaker 5>like a good cautionary tale for like </v>
<v Speaker 5>beating a brand in the ground to the </v>

443
00:16:14.431 --> 00:16:17.140
<v Speaker 5>point where you gotta like go up to some</v>
<v Speaker 5>people and go,</v>

444
00:16:17.141 --> 00:16:18.160
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't wear shit.</v>

445
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.700
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know plenty though.</v>

446
00:16:21.701 --> 00:16:22.160
<v Speaker 4>It's so</v>

447
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.330
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

448
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing like branding and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

449
00:16:25.161 --> 00:16:25.994
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like now I'm becoming so aware of it </v>

450
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:29.264
<v Speaker 1>because I know other writers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really big avenue because if </v>

451
00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:31.604
<v Speaker 1>you think about Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's become president because of </v>

452
00:16:34.011 --> 00:16:34.880
<v Speaker 1>his brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

453
00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:36.200
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

454
00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:38.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm stealing one of the other writers </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas right now,</v>

455
00:16:38.361 --> 00:16:39.980
<v Speaker 1>so I shouldn't be saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

456
00:16:39.981 --> 00:16:40.814
<v Speaker 1>But I mean really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a brand and that brand was so </v>

457
00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:43.634
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It convinced a bunch of people that </v>

458
00:16:45.831 --> 00:16:47.420
<v Speaker 1>that's what was going to be best for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

459
00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:48.890
<v Speaker 1>And it was a brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a commercial.</v>

460
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:50.743
<v Speaker 5>There's that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think there's also a real lack of </v>

461
00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:53.414
<v Speaker 5>substantial options.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't like there was any one </v>

462
00:16:55.131 --> 00:16:57.110
<v Speaker 5>compelling person that was next to him.</v>

463
00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.013
<v Speaker 1>I know I was such a Bernie Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really thought that he was outside of </v>

464
00:17:01.351 --> 00:17:02.570
<v Speaker 1>the mold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

465
00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.760
<v Speaker 1>but everybody is a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

466
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:06.773
<v Speaker 5>he's a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's the best example I think of a guy </v>

467
00:17:08.641 --> 00:17:11.490
<v Speaker 5>who really isn't beholden to any special</v>
<v Speaker 5>interest groups.</v>

468
00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:12.773
<v Speaker 5>But I think what he offered and what </v>
<v Speaker 5>trump offers as well is that they're </v>

469
00:17:17.311 --> 00:17:20.820
<v Speaker 5>outside of the system in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trump appears to be like way more inside</v>

470
00:17:20.821 --> 00:17:21.654
<v Speaker 5>the system news giving on to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at least it's shakes up this </v>

471
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.053
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have this like really cryptic sort </v>

472
00:17:30.601 --> 00:17:35.601
<v Speaker 5>of way of doing business and bizarre way</v>
<v Speaker 5>of intermingling money and influence and</v>

473
00:17:37.921 --> 00:17:38.754
<v Speaker 5>politics and putting it all together and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just something has got to come </v>

474
00:17:42.601 --> 00:17:43.920
<v Speaker 5>along to let people know like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

475
00:17:43.921 --> 00:17:46.620
<v Speaker 5>this system sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't represent us.</v>

476
00:17:46.621 --> 00:17:48.060
<v Speaker 5>It's foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's ancient.</v>

477
00:17:48.061 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 5>It was made up when people used to write</v>
<v Speaker 5>with</v>

478
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.700
<v Speaker 2>feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really need a better system.</v>

479
00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.240
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree.</v>

480
00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.370
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this entire election,</v>

481
00:17:57.371 --> 00:17:59.230
<v Speaker 1>everything about it has pushed me into </v>
<v Speaker 1>being like,</v>

482
00:17:59.231 --> 00:18:00.064
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a straight up socialist like an I </v>

483
00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.400
<v Speaker 1>used to resist that title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you say no,</v>

484
00:18:03.401 --> 00:18:04.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm liberal and I'm this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

485
00:18:04.961 --> 00:18:05.651
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

486
00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:07.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm a socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually even think that I agree</v>

487
00:18:07.901 --> 00:18:10.660
<v Speaker 1>with some of the liberal things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been espoused during all of this.</v>

488
00:18:10.661 --> 00:18:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Like I think that we are at a point and </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved people,</v>

489
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:16.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

490
00:18:16.571 --> 00:18:17.404
<v Speaker 1>in such a respect that we have to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>care of each other and it has to be </v>

491
00:18:20.501 --> 00:18:21.334
<v Speaker 1>mandated from a bigger power because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take care of each other otherwise </v>

492
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.020
<v Speaker 1>no socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in what way?</v>

493
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.270
<v Speaker 1>How do you define it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

494
00:18:28.271 --> 00:18:30.760
<v Speaker 1>my idea of socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course we'd never fly,</v>

495
00:18:30.761 --> 00:18:31.594
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all pay into a system that pays us </v>

496
00:18:33.911 --> 00:18:35.080
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all,</v>

497
00:18:35.081 --> 00:18:35.914
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all work for the common man and I </v>

498
00:18:36.821 --> 00:18:39.580
<v Speaker 1>know that that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never works.</v>

499
00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.310
<v Speaker 1>But in my mind that's the way it should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

500
00:18:42.311 --> 00:18:44.110
<v Speaker 1>that we should all be working for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy next to us.</v>

501
00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.730
<v Speaker 1>What would work great if people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

502
00:18:45.731 --> 00:18:47.410
<v Speaker 1>if they're hardworking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart people.</v>

503
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have student loans out now.</v>

504
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Well that's another discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

505
00:18:52.971 --> 00:18:54.920
<v Speaker 2>But I think student loans are </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusting.</v>

506
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:55.783
<v Speaker 2>I think what they're doing by </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidizing education and making people </v>

507
00:18:58.041 --> 00:18:59.660
<v Speaker 2>pay these ridiculous rates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

508
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.090
<v Speaker 2>if you go bankrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

509
00:19:02.091 --> 00:19:03.920
<v Speaker 2>You still have to pay your student </v>
<v Speaker 2>loans.</v>

510
00:19:03.921 --> 00:19:07.700
<v Speaker 2>You can never get away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A single other business venture that you</v>

511
00:19:07.701 --> 00:19:11.240
<v Speaker 2>get into and you would consider </v>
<v Speaker 2>investing in your education and possibly</v>

512
00:19:11.241 --> 00:19:13.070
<v Speaker 2>a future as some sort of a business </v>
<v Speaker 2>venture,</v>

513
00:19:13.071 --> 00:19:18.071
<v Speaker 2>business slash educational adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not you all that money period.</v>

514
00:19:18.381 --> 00:19:19.770
<v Speaker 2>You're not getting away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

515
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.380
<v Speaker 2>they'll drag you to the ground.</v>

516
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.310
<v Speaker 1>They will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

517
00:19:22.311 --> 00:19:23.144
<v Speaker 1>and I would say that the thing that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>does have going for is the interest </v>

518
00:19:25.191 --> 00:19:26.024
<v Speaker 1>rates a little bit better than like </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit cards and cars and stuff should </v>

519
00:19:28.191 --> 00:19:30.860
<v Speaker 1>be zero interest rate should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean education should be,</v>

520
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:32.563
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be for every like people </v>

521
00:19:33.561 --> 00:19:35.600
<v Speaker 1>should be educated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be.</v>

522
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:36.750
<v Speaker 2>And I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

523
00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:39.750
<v Speaker 2>I think it should be free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I 100 and I think it should be available</v>

524
00:19:39.751 --> 00:19:40.584
<v Speaker 2>to anyone at anytime in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should be like 43 </v>

525
00:19:43.531 --> 00:19:45.630
<v Speaker 2>years old and you can't go back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>school again.</v>

526
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.493
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it should be able to go </v>

527
00:19:46.621 --> 00:19:47.454
<v Speaker 2>back to school at anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't just be for 18 year old </v>

528
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:49.854
<v Speaker 2>people right out of high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be for anybody that really </v>

529
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:53.390
<v Speaker 2>wants to learn and educate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

530
00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think 18 year old people </v>

531
00:19:55.901 --> 00:19:58.180
<v Speaker 1>right out of high school should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking some time off to actually see the</v>

532
00:19:58.181 --> 00:19:59.014
<v Speaker 1>world before they go back into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't choose to approach </v>

533
00:20:01.661 --> 00:20:05.800
<v Speaker 1>your education seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a really hard time.</v>

534
00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a big fan of rigid systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

535
00:20:08.261 --> 00:20:10.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of like this really </v>
<v Speaker 2>regimented,</v>

536
00:20:10.571 --> 00:20:13.840
<v Speaker 2>go through four years of high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go through four years of college,</v>

537
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.520
<v Speaker 2>then you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get a job.</v>

538
00:20:15.521 --> 00:20:17.500
<v Speaker 2>It's dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're 30 you should have a child.</v>

539
00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.740
<v Speaker 2>I just don't buy any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's,</v>

540
00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:21.873
<v Speaker 2>there's so many different people out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there with so many different dreams and </v>

541
00:20:24.011 --> 00:20:26.970
<v Speaker 2>aspirations and interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>

542
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:28.023
<v Speaker 2>it's so rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when kids see this rigid path in </v>

543
00:20:30.341 --> 00:20:31.330
<v Speaker 2>front of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

544
00:20:31.331 --> 00:20:34.120
<v Speaker 2>it gives them anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it used to give me as to see</v>

545
00:20:34.121 --> 00:20:36.310
<v Speaker 2>people that were going to college and </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting degrees,</v>

546
00:20:36.311 --> 00:20:38.110
<v Speaker 2>getting jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd get anxious because it was like,</v>

547
00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like a loser.</v>

548
00:20:40.871 --> 00:20:42.580
<v Speaker 2>I feel like an outcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

549
00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:47.730
<v Speaker 2>And I think that if we made education </v>
<v Speaker 2>free and made it available to people,</v>

550
00:20:47.951 --> 00:20:48.784
<v Speaker 2>like I just don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that if we could spend the </v>

551
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:51.940
<v Speaker 2>amount of money that we spend on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>

552
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.190
<v Speaker 2>not that we should cut back the amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>of money,</v>

553
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.203
<v Speaker 2>but there's gotta be that same amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money or in the neighborhood of that </v>

554
00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:58.924
<v Speaker 2>same amount of money that could go </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards infrastructure that could go </v>

555
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:02.164
<v Speaker 2>towards education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could go towards impoverished </v>

556
00:21:03.911 --> 00:21:04.570
<v Speaker 2>communities.</v>

557
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.840
<v Speaker 2>There's like zero effort made to build </v>
<v Speaker 2>this country back up.</v>

558
00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say yeah,</v>

559
00:21:09.081 --> 00:21:12.020
<v Speaker 3>and looking at the proposals on deck </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

560
00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.680
<v Speaker 3>the little that's being used for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the any and stuff like that,</v>

561
00:21:15.681 --> 00:21:17.960
<v Speaker 3>that's being taken off now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the what?</v>

562
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.880
<v Speaker 3>The National Endowment for the arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

563
00:21:19.881 --> 00:21:23.330
<v Speaker 3>That gives actual like people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>artists who maybe don't fit the mold but</v>

564
00:21:23.331 --> 00:21:26.600
<v Speaker 3>actually have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a venture going for them that they could</v>

565
00:21:26.601 --> 00:21:29.720
<v Speaker 3>be successful with if they got some sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of funding or support.</v>

566
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:32.610
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've been to the La County Museum of</v>

567
00:21:32.611 --> 00:21:34.110
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Lacma thing.</v>

568
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take you there.</v>

569
00:21:35.251 --> 00:21:36.300
<v Speaker 2>If you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll fucking,</v>

570
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.193
<v Speaker 2>you want to throw punches at people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the most ridiculous like </v>

571
00:21:40.471 --> 00:21:41.304
<v Speaker 2>modern art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a video of people playing </v>

572
00:21:42.931 --> 00:21:44.790
<v Speaker 2>catch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is art and I'm not kidding.</v>

573
00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

574
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:46.740
<v Speaker 2>it's all subsidized</v>

575
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.153
<v Speaker 3>very hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually love modern art if I know </v>

576
00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:52.360
<v Speaker 3>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I don't,</v>

577
00:21:52.361 --> 00:21:53.194
<v Speaker 3>then I feel like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not getting it and I don't </v>

578
00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:56.590
<v Speaker 3>understand what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

579
00:21:56.591 --> 00:21:57.940
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think that,</v>

580
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.690
<v Speaker 3>I think not pushing art on people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say pushing our,</v>

581
00:22:01.691 --> 00:22:02.524
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess providing opportunities for art </v>

582
00:22:03.581 --> 00:22:06.190
<v Speaker 3>for people and not just art isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>painting or sculpture,</v>

583
00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:07.024
<v Speaker 3>but I mean like writing and literature </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's the ways I do think that the </v>

584
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:12.940
<v Speaker 3>rigid educational system or you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

585
00:22:12.941 --> 00:22:13.751
<v Speaker 3>you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do this,</v>

586
00:22:13.751 --> 00:22:14.584
<v Speaker 3>you do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people's brains just aren't wired </v>

587
00:22:15.581 --> 00:22:16.330
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

588
00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:20.560
<v Speaker 3>But there are other avenues for them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be creative and define themselves.</v>

589
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.423
<v Speaker 3>And like I found with mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was prelaw and then my last </v>

590
00:22:24.131 --> 00:22:25.800
<v Speaker 3>semester of college I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to,</v>

591
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go to law school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do this.</v>

592
00:22:27.551 --> 00:22:29.490
<v Speaker 3>I want to be professional fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

593
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.320
<v Speaker 2>what would compel you to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you,</v>

594
00:22:31.321 --> 00:22:33.270
<v Speaker 2>you have this long history of martial </v>
<v Speaker 2>arts,</v>

595
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.310
<v Speaker 2>you got into martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said when you're four,</v>

596
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:36.300
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

597
00:22:36.301 --> 00:22:37.134
<v Speaker 2>four taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

598
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.770
<v Speaker 2>And so you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did you first compete?</v>

599
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.120
<v Speaker 2>Did you compete in taekwondo tournament?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

600
00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:42.901
<v Speaker 3>Did I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

601
00:22:42.901 --> 00:22:46.980
<v Speaker 3>when I was a teenager I did a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Nazca circuit and the um,</v>

602
00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.730
<v Speaker 3>international sport car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever those,</v>

603
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.200
<v Speaker 3>so point karate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

604
00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:51.034
<v Speaker 3>I did a lot of point karate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell from my fighting cause it </v>

605
00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:55.250
<v Speaker 3>was always stick at my chin out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

606
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.141
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

607
00:22:56.141 --> 00:22:56.974
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a lot of sport karate and I was </v>

608
00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.920
<v Speaker 3>very anxious to be competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

609
00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.020
<v Speaker 3>one of my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went back to the,</v>

610
00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:02.854
<v Speaker 3>to the final hook and shoot a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks ago and one of my friends Darrell </v>

611
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:06.070
<v Speaker 3>nearer used to train with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

612
00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:06.904
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

613
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:07.893
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you remember when you were 15 or </v>

614
00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:09.394
<v Speaker 3>you're running around the gym just </v>
<v Speaker 3>asking people to punch you in the face </v>

615
00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:13.360
<v Speaker 3>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you weren't allowed to punch in the face</v>

616
00:23:13.361 --> 00:23:14.194
<v Speaker 3>in some of these tournaments and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to know if you could keep </v>

617
00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:16.144
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I wanted to know if I could keep </v>

618
00:23:17.201 --> 00:23:18.400
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I got punched in the face,</v>

619
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:19.493
<v Speaker 2>I was going quit bold to hit you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>training so that you could see if you </v>

620
00:23:21.601 --> 00:23:22.270
<v Speaker 2>can keep going.</v>

621
00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I had my nose severely broken </v>

622
00:23:24.671 --> 00:23:26.340
<v Speaker 3>where I had to have surgery on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

623
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:27.783
<v Speaker 3>and after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when I decided to be a </v>

624
00:23:28.691 --> 00:23:30.250
<v Speaker 3>professional fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After the surgery,</v>

625
00:23:30.251 --> 00:23:32.920
<v Speaker 3>I should have probably waited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how'd you get your nose broken?</v>

626
00:23:32.921 --> 00:23:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Initially?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spin.</v>

627
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:34.391
<v Speaker 3>Spin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hook,</v>

628
00:23:34.391 --> 00:23:35.151
<v Speaker 3>kick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Geez.</v>

629
00:23:35.151 --> 00:23:36.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like over here.</v>

630
00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad one.</v>

631
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:38.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

632
00:23:38.321 --> 00:23:39.154
<v Speaker 3>now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been broken like seven or eight </v>

633
00:23:39.941 --> 00:23:41.650
<v Speaker 3>times now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'd love to get it fixed again,</v>

634
00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:44.830
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not sure that my student health </v>
<v Speaker 3>insurance covers that.</v>

635
00:23:44.831 --> 00:23:45.080
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

636
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.190
<v Speaker 5>does your septum work or is it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

637
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.423
<v Speaker 5>I can't breathe out of the left side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I found out though was really </v>

638
00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:55.060
<v Speaker 5>disturbing was that your ears like how </v>
<v Speaker 5>they calcify and become cauliflower ear.</v>

639
00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:56.630
<v Speaker 5>Your nose does that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

640
00:23:56.631 --> 00:23:57.560
<v Speaker 5>I can believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

641
00:23:57.561 --> 00:23:58.394
<v Speaker 5>So the inside of your nose can develop </v>
<v Speaker 5>all these hard calcified areas where </v>

642
00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:04.220
<v Speaker 5>blood is sort of pulled in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>

643
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:07.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had to get mine scraped out and they,</v>

644
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.890
<v Speaker 5>they cut out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they're called the turbinates,</v>

645
00:24:09.891 --> 00:24:10.724
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these big lumps in there and they kind </v>

646
00:24:11.921 --> 00:24:12.754
<v Speaker 5>of cut them down to open up the path and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they shoved splints in there and </v>

647
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.250
<v Speaker 5>separate it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it mixed,</v>

648
00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:19.683
<v Speaker 5>it makes the whole wider.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Making the whole wider is not always a </v>

649
00:24:23.121 --> 00:24:25.090
<v Speaker 5>good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I would say for a nose it's,</v>

650
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.590
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes and yes.</v>

651
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:29.810
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm kind of pervy.</v>

652
00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.520
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

653
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:32.620
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's um,</v>

654
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.010
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would love to have my nose fixed,</v>

655
00:24:34.011 --> 00:24:34.844
<v Speaker 5>but it is kind of helps you breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it helps you sleep if your nose is </v>

656
00:24:38.331 --> 00:24:39.440
<v Speaker 5>a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

657
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.600
<v Speaker 5>mine was fucked up till I was 39 I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>

658
00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:43.970
<v Speaker 5>or 40 and then I finally got it fixed </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was like,</v>

659
00:24:43.971 --> 00:24:44.804
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe I lived like this my </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole life with a fucked up stuffed up </v>

660
00:24:47.751 --> 00:24:49.950
<v Speaker 5>nose all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>More clearly.</v>

661
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.670
<v Speaker 5>My cardio is better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's better.</v>

662
00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.670
<v Speaker 5>When I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just was a mouth breather.</v>

663
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.620
<v Speaker 5>Like literally a mouth breather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

664
00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:59.010
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of fighters that are like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

665
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.260
<v Speaker 5>You talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he kind of,</v>

666
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.990
<v Speaker 5>you hear that in their voice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how they have that thing going on with a</v>

667
00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:04.430
<v Speaker 5>nasal when you know like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

668
00:25:04.431 --> 00:25:05.264
<v Speaker 5>you're all clogged up man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I always wonder what the </v>

669
00:25:08.271 --> 00:25:12.260
<v Speaker 5>relationship between fighters and like </v>
<v Speaker 5>sinus medication is a lot.</v>

670
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was gonna say like,</v>

671
00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:15.650
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I still take it all the time just to,</v>

672
00:25:15.651 --> 00:25:17.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just to be able to function.</v>

673
00:25:17.751 --> 00:25:21.380
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise Shit's addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very addictive.</v>

674
00:25:21.381 --> 00:25:23.770
<v Speaker 5>Like what does it Afrins yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

675
00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.480
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're making me think right now.</v>

676
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird thing.</v>

677
00:25:28.791 --> 00:25:29.624
<v Speaker 5>That stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it makes your nostrils dilate and it </v>

678
00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:33.483
<v Speaker 5>opens them up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you stop taking it all clamps </v>

679
00:25:35.061 --> 00:25:37.300
<v Speaker 5>down feels like even tighter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

680
00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:39.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Good.</v>

681
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of good therapy for it.</v>

682
00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:43.873
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of guys stuff that stuff up their </v>

683
00:25:44.781 --> 00:25:46.070
<v Speaker 5>nose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

684
00:25:46.071 --> 00:25:48.620
<v Speaker 5>Though the body is just not meant to </v>
<v Speaker 5>take the kind of abuse.</v>

685
00:25:48.621 --> 00:25:49.820
<v Speaker 5>You were good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were detailing.</v>

686
00:25:49.821 --> 00:25:52.160
<v Speaker 5>Your neck is fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your knees are fucked up.</v>

687
00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.940
<v Speaker 5>My shoulder is still pretty weak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

688
00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.580
<v Speaker 5>that fixed my labor on it happened in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the tate fight.</v>

689
00:25:58.581 --> 00:25:59.414
<v Speaker 5>I think it was tearing before that fight</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I always had a lot of shoulder </v>

690
00:26:01.191 --> 00:26:01.760
<v Speaker 5>pain.</v>

691
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.860
<v Speaker 5>But I've had shoulder pain on both sides</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot.</v>

692
00:26:03.861 --> 00:26:05.480
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>during the tate fight,</v>

693
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.373
<v Speaker 5>I remember throwing a left hook or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something and just below what the hell </v>

694
00:26:08.781 --> 00:26:10.820
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My labor was torn all the way through,</v>

695
00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:14.840
<v Speaker 5>but I had this weird genetic thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>called a Buford complex,</v>

696
00:26:14.841 --> 00:26:16.850
<v Speaker 5>which that's an hilarious name for </v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

697
00:26:16.851 --> 00:26:17.684
<v Speaker 5>but it's like a thick intendance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was holding my arm up so I didn't </v>

698
00:26:20.181 --> 00:26:22.040
<v Speaker 5>know that it was actually torn all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way through.</v>

699
00:26:22.041 --> 00:26:22.874
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't like limp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I do remember like not all of a </v>

700
00:26:24.831 --> 00:26:26.900
<v Speaker 5>sudden not being able to base on my left</v>
<v Speaker 5>side and be like,</v>

701
00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:28.100
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's going on here?</v>

702
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:32.360
<v Speaker 5>But during the fight that was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So did you get that fixed?</v>

703
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.220
<v Speaker 5>That's what the surgery was for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was,</v>

704
00:26:34.221 --> 00:26:35.054
<v Speaker 5>it was a really intense surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't think it was gonna be that big </v>

705
00:26:36.441 --> 00:26:37.274
<v Speaker 5>of a deal cause I hear about people </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to get their knees scoped and </v>

706
00:26:39.171 --> 00:26:40.004
<v Speaker 5>stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I couldn't get out of bed for a </v>

707
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:42.703
<v Speaker 5>week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I had to have,</v>

708
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 5>my mother had to come</v>

709
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.360
<v Speaker 3>take care of me and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

710
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 3>it was 32 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

711
00:26:46.921 --> 00:26:47.754
<v Speaker 3>this is embarrassing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't actually get out of bed </v>

712
00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:52.920
<v Speaker 3>and move and I ended up having a bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction to the medication and yeah,</v>

713
00:26:52.921 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a good time.</v>

714
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>surgeries down.</v>

715
00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.313
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what we're saying that the human </v>

716
00:26:59.031 --> 00:27:01.200
<v Speaker 2>body is just not designed for combat </v>
<v Speaker 2>sports.</v>

717
00:27:01.201 --> 00:27:02.034
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after a while everyone's sorta gives </v>

718
00:27:03.741 --> 00:27:04.574
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why when you see a guy like Dan </v>

719
00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Henderson still throwing down whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like 46 years old,</v>

720
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.200
<v Speaker 2>have you seen Dan walk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He walks like he's made out of wood,</v>

721
00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:15.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walks like he's got no flexibility.</v>

722
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden he's in the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just comes alive.</v>

723
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:18.283
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

724
00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:19.243
<v Speaker 3>Something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greg always called me the Lucille ball </v>

725
00:27:21.801 --> 00:27:25.040
<v Speaker 3>of him or me because he said that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just the clumsiest person he'd ever met.</v>

726
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Like I would just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would trip over every,</v>

727
00:27:27.021 --> 00:27:28.520
<v Speaker 3>I fell down all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he said,</v>

728
00:27:28.521 --> 00:27:29.354
<v Speaker 3>but when you were fighting you actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like use that phrase came </v>

729
00:27:31.881 --> 00:27:32.481
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said you,</v>

730
00:27:32.481 --> 00:27:34.370
<v Speaker 3>you would actually move like you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be moving.</v>

731
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.533
<v Speaker 3>So I do think that maybe the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>body's not meant to take punishment in </v>

732
00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.290
<v Speaker 3>combat sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think we're also built to fight in</v>

733
00:27:43.291 --> 00:27:45.260
<v Speaker 3>a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've been fighting for years.</v>

734
00:27:45.261 --> 00:27:46.610
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really is like,</v>

735
00:27:46.611 --> 00:27:49.160
<v Speaker 3>it's Cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is kind of in our DNA to scrap.</v>

736
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:50.243
<v Speaker 2>It has you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's shot just not in your DNA to do it </v>

737
00:27:51.781 --> 00:27:53.490
<v Speaker 2>all the time and stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

738
00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:57.390
<v Speaker 3>And to sweat your body down to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain part and then go here and then,</v>

739
00:27:57.391 --> 00:27:58.150
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

740
00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.830
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about that because that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

741
00:27:59.831 --> 00:28:02.320
<v Speaker 2>one of the most disturbing things it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening lately.</v>

742
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.183
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these fights that are falling apart </v>

743
00:28:04.361 --> 00:28:05.194
<v Speaker 2>because people are cutting weight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting so much weight that they're </v>

744
00:28:07.511 --> 00:28:08.344
<v Speaker 2>literally on death's door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean whack to the hen and Barao fight </v>

745
00:28:11.501 --> 00:28:15.280
<v Speaker 2>when he was supposed to fight Tj </v>
<v Speaker 2>dillashaw and fell asleep like,</v>

746
00:28:15.281 --> 00:28:19.510
<v Speaker 2>and banged his head off the wall like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a couple weeks ago,</v>

747
00:28:19.511 --> 00:28:20.580
<v Speaker 2>the Habib number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good madoff,</v>

748
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.423
<v Speaker 2>Tony Ferguson fight gets called off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the biggest fights of </v>

749
00:28:23.621 --> 00:28:25.360
<v Speaker 2>the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for fans,</v>

750
00:28:25.361 --> 00:28:28.720
<v Speaker 2>it's just so disappointing because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were so looking forward to that fight.</v>

751
00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.460
<v Speaker 2>What do you think could be done about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as a professional,</v>

752
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.903
<v Speaker 3>as a professional</v>

753
00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:36.123
<v Speaker 2>and as a commentator?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it was paid to do commentary </v>

754
00:28:38.081 --> 00:28:38.914
<v Speaker 2>for Invicta.</v>

755
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.150
<v Speaker 3>I know it was also the matchmaker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was actually,</v>

756
00:28:41.151 --> 00:28:42.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stepped down from that one.</v>

757
00:28:42.471 --> 00:28:45.010
<v Speaker 3>I backed up and went back to school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm no longer the INVICTA matchmaker,</v>

758
00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:48.860
<v Speaker 3>but part of my job was I had this really</v>
<v Speaker 3>regimented checking the girls wait twice</v>

759
00:28:48.861 --> 00:28:50.300
<v Speaker 3>a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say the fighters wait,</v>

760
00:28:50.301 --> 00:28:51.980
<v Speaker 3>but I'm a girl too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I can say girl,</v>

761
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:53.443
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would check their weight twice a day </v>

762
00:28:54.621 --> 00:28:56.450
<v Speaker 3>and I had them text me their weight and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

763
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.433
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need you to send me a picture of what </v>

764
00:28:58.191 --> 00:28:59.990
<v Speaker 3>you're weighing on your scale right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>and compare it to this.</v>

765
00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:02.060
<v Speaker 3>Like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was kind of a bitch,</v>

766
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.510
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't want fighters missing </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight on my watch.</v>

767
00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.310
<v Speaker 3>The problem was they were still going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ms.</v>

768
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:08.143
<v Speaker 3>Wade anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's eight is there's something archaic </v>

769
00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:11.390
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

770
00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.420
<v Speaker 3>it needs to change I think more weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>classes.</v>

771
00:29:14.421 --> 00:29:15.254
<v Speaker 3>You said that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think more weight classes is a really </v>

772
00:29:16.341 --> 00:29:16.620
<v Speaker 3>good idea.</v>

773
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like every 10 pounds yeah.</v>

774
00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Is more than reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

775
00:29:20.461 --> 00:29:23.790
<v Speaker 2>boxing is way better and way more </v>
<v Speaker 2>options.</v>

776
00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:24.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think every,</v>

777
00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:28.840
<v Speaker 3>every six pounds almost would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although that's a lot more divisions.</v>

778
00:29:28.841 --> 00:29:29.674
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many people who want </v>

779
00:29:30.191 --> 00:29:31.024
<v Speaker 3>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many people who want to </v>

780
00:29:31.571 --> 00:29:32.040
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

781
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:32.873
<v Speaker 2>I think for women in more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when you're talking about six </v>

782
00:29:35.461 --> 00:29:36.294
<v Speaker 2>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about a greater </v>

783
00:29:36.511 --> 00:29:38.520
<v Speaker 2>percentage of body weight for a lighter </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

784
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:40.950
<v Speaker 2>And when you're talking about 10 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a heavyweight,</v>

785
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 2>it's like they take a shit.</v>

786
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.590
<v Speaker 5>It's 10 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know those giant people like Francis</v>

787
00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:45.424
<v Speaker 5>and Ghana.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

788
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.080
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could probably lose 10 pounds in three</v>

789
00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:47.914
<v Speaker 5>minutes if you want it to his shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so much surface area to sweat </v>

790
00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:50.890
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

791
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.440
<v Speaker 5>So massive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you talking about mighty mouse,</v>

792
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:57.160
<v Speaker 5>10 pounds is a giant amount of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like you want to own j check,</v>

793
00:29:57.161 --> 00:29:59.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like one 15 so yeah.</v>

794
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.850
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't wait to see her at 25 but,</v>

795
00:30:00.851 --> 00:30:01.601
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm really eight.</v>

796
00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:03.250
<v Speaker 5>Is she going to go?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

797
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:04.540
<v Speaker 5>but I'm hoping,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm hoping.</v>

798
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:07.020
<v Speaker 5>I hope she have a hard time to make 15 I</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't know.</v>

799
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:07.860
<v Speaker 5>I know that she said</v>

800
00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.693
<v Speaker 3>she's expressed an interest at fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>at one 25 which makes me think that one </v>

801
00:30:10.891 --> 00:30:13.110
<v Speaker 3>15 like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met her maybe twice,</v>

802
00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:15.210
<v Speaker 3>so I've never had a lengthy discussion </v>
<v Speaker 3>with her.</v>

803
00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.770
<v Speaker 3>She's so bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

804
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.633
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time she fights I just get so </v>

805
00:30:18.901 --> 00:30:19.370
<v Speaker 3>excited.</v>

806
00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:23.000
<v Speaker 5>She's so far Roche's I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's so ferocious.</v>

807
00:30:23.001 --> 00:30:26.000
<v Speaker 5>Like I'll watch that a fight with her </v>
<v Speaker 5>and Jessica pinay again.</v>

808
00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.770
<v Speaker 5>It's like good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

809
00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:28.693
<v Speaker 5>Like when she smells blood and she </v>
<v Speaker 5>starts attacking is smashing with </v>

810
00:30:31.221 --> 00:30:33.560
<v Speaker 5>elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she's one of the scariest people in</v>

811
00:30:33.561 --> 00:30:35.130
<v Speaker 5>the sport now and it's beautiful isn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>it?</v>

812
00:30:35.131 --> 00:30:35.964
<v Speaker 5>They get her off you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't get her off right at the end </v>

813
00:30:38.031 --> 00:30:38.864
<v Speaker 5>of her punches and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she knows exactly what to do with </v>

814
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.633
<v Speaker 5>renaming everything every,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so she's so technical and she's just so </v>

815
00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:46.880
<v Speaker 5>goddamn aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

816
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:48.650
<v Speaker 5>Poof.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Technical,</v>

817
00:30:48.651 --> 00:30:50.160
<v Speaker 5>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ferocious.</v>

818
00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:54.890
<v Speaker 5>She gives really cookies and ship before</v>
<v Speaker 5>she beats her head.</v>

819
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:56.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

820
00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:57.413
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that entertainment side of it was </v>

821
00:30:59.161 --> 00:30:59.994
<v Speaker 3>never something I captured myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't have that little niche </v>

822
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.590
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I see fighters do that,</v>

823
00:31:04.591 --> 00:31:09.420
<v Speaker 3>like her who can be the full package,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can destroy an opponent and make the</v>

824
00:31:09.421 --> 00:31:12.540
<v Speaker 3>fans look forward to just watching her </v>
<v Speaker 3>walk onto a stage.</v>

825
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:13.630
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>

826
00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:15.400
<v Speaker 5>well that's really who she is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

827
00:31:15.401 --> 00:31:16.234
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's not,</v>

828
00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:17.760
<v Speaker 5>she's not faking it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

829
00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:18.460
<v Speaker 5>Who she is.</v>

830
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.230
<v Speaker 3>And when we talk about branding and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that,</v>

831
00:31:20.231 --> 00:31:21.064
<v Speaker 3>you kind of wonder who falls into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>category of staying who they are as a </v>

832
00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:24.900
<v Speaker 3>brand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a fighter.</v>

833
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who creates something for themselves and</v>

834
00:31:27.071 --> 00:31:31.030
<v Speaker 3>how much of that is actually authentic </v>
<v Speaker 3>or how much they try to pretend.</v>

835
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:32.020
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

836
00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

837
00:31:33.201 --> 00:31:35.930
<v Speaker 5>And when you do fake it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody sort of sees it,</v>

838
00:31:35.931 --> 00:31:38.430
<v Speaker 5>you're faking it and it comes off gross </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they get mad at you.</v>

839
00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.550
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A guy like conor,</v>

840
00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.533
<v Speaker 5>you know like that famous press </v>
<v Speaker 5>conference where Jeremy Stevens calls </v>

841
00:31:43.851 --> 00:31:46.940
<v Speaker 5>him out and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who the fuck is that guy at?</v>

842
00:31:46.941 --> 00:31:49.850
<v Speaker 5>The speed that he has is natural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

843
00:31:49.851 --> 00:31:52.520
<v Speaker 5>it is who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just knows how to do it.</v>

844
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.890
<v Speaker 5>And so when he does it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's effortless.</v>

845
00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.010
<v Speaker 5>But when some people try to just look so</v>
<v Speaker 5>goofy,</v>

846
00:31:58.011 --> 00:31:59.090
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

847
00:31:59.091 --> 00:31:59.924
<v Speaker 5>it's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People want to see you lose when you do </v>

848
00:32:01.041 --> 00:32:01.320
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

849
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it,</v>

850
00:32:02.411 --> 00:32:03.244
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes as inauthentic and it's the </v>

851
00:32:04.181 --> 00:32:06.860
<v Speaker 3>last weird demand that we have as fans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I,</v>

852
00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't consider myself a fighter </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

853
00:32:08.271 --> 00:32:11.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fight fan now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have this demand for the fighters</v>

854
00:32:11.331 --> 00:32:15.200
<v Speaker 3>to be authentic when they're fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also when they present themselves,</v>

855
00:32:15.201 --> 00:32:18.110
<v Speaker 3>they have to be themselves somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or we call them fake or we call it,</v>

856
00:32:18.111 --> 00:32:18.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

857
00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:19.130
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

858
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:20.780
<v Speaker 3>we have a lot of demands on fighters.</v>

859
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:21.703
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're putting them under this massive </v>

860
00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.570
<v Speaker 5>microscope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

861
00:32:23.571 --> 00:32:27.860
<v Speaker 5>you're seeing someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you see two fighters go to war,</v>

862
00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:30.020
<v Speaker 5>you're seeing their souls bared out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

863
00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.163
<v Speaker 5>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see so much in what they're capable </v>

864
00:32:34.881 --> 00:32:35.600
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how the,</v>

865
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.030
<v Speaker 5>the capable of focusing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pushing themselves,</v>

866
00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.430
<v Speaker 5>what they've to discipline themselves</v>

867
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.170
<v Speaker 2>to get ready physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

868
00:32:42.171 --> 00:32:43.004
<v Speaker 2>you could see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you see them express themselves </v>

869
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.660
<v Speaker 2>with their endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like talking about mighty mouse again.</v>

870
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.740
<v Speaker 2>Like you see what amount of work that </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys put in in the gym.</v>

871
00:32:51.741 --> 00:32:52.574
<v Speaker 2>When you see him in the fifth round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving a thousand miles an hour and not </v>

872
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:55.454
<v Speaker 2>even breathing heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's an expression in that </v>

873
00:32:57.861 --> 00:33:00.530
<v Speaker 2>like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing something that this guy is</v>

874
00:33:00.531 --> 00:33:02.570
<v Speaker 2>like showing you everything he's got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's showing,</v>

875
00:33:02.571 --> 00:33:03.680
<v Speaker 2>showing you his full care.</v>

876
00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:04.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's showing,</v>

877
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:05.623
<v Speaker 3>there's that click that happens with </v>
<v Speaker 3>some fighters where they're getting </v>

878
00:33:07.431 --> 00:33:09.820
<v Speaker 3>beaten down and all of a sudden they </v>
<v Speaker 3>turn it around me.</v>

879
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.240
<v Speaker 3>She takes a great example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

880
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:12.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and her fight with holly,</v>

881
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.300
<v Speaker 3>like she kicked my ass too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the arm bar.</v>

882
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:14.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

883
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.823
<v Speaker 3>she turns it around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something happens in there and you can </v>

884
00:33:17.481 --> 00:33:18.314
<v Speaker 3>see that that's the warrior thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has one actual wars in people where </v>

885
00:33:22.701 --> 00:33:23.331
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

886
00:33:23.331 --> 00:33:24.590
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

887
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.540
<v Speaker 3>it makes me think of Henry the fifth a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>

888
00:33:26.541 --> 00:33:27.374
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like those moments where we are </v>

889
00:33:28.671 --> 00:33:30.230
<v Speaker 3>outnumbered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to suck.</v>

890
00:33:30.231 --> 00:33:32.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm losing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's going against me.</v>

891
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:33.230
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here I go.</v>

892
00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm still going to keep pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

893
00:33:35.001 --> 00:33:35.834
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like moments like that if you can </v>

894
00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.253
<v Speaker 3>look at fighting from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess you don't take fighting </v>

895
00:33:41.151 --> 00:33:43.160
<v Speaker 3>personally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>

896
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to explain it by taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>it personally.</v>

897
00:33:45.111 --> 00:33:49.790
<v Speaker 3>But if you can invest yourself in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>moments of glory for another person,</v>

898
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:52.970
<v Speaker 3>did you get inspired?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get really turned on to the,</v>

899
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:57.500
<v Speaker 3>to the whole sport and you really </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand and you can see the human.</v>

900
00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.593
<v Speaker 2>Is that easier for you to do now that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've retired than it was to do while </v>

901
00:34:00.821 --> 00:34:01.654
<v Speaker 2>you're competing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you like compare yourself against </v>

902
00:34:02.741 --> 00:34:03.230
<v Speaker 2>those goals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

903
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.330
<v Speaker 3>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the most,</v>

904
00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:09.470
<v Speaker 3>I am a terrible person and I think I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

905
00:34:09.471 --> 00:34:10.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

906
00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:11.363
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think mentally I defeated myself more </v>

907
00:34:13.431 --> 00:34:15.500
<v Speaker 3>than I ever did physically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

908
00:34:15.501 --> 00:34:16.334
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

909
00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.353
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always compared myself against other </v>

910
00:34:18.681 --> 00:34:19.401
<v Speaker 3>people and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

911
00:34:19.401 --> 00:34:20.690
<v Speaker 3>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person's doing this,</v>

912
00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:21.351
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

913
00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:22.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm not getting that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing that.</v>

914
00:34:22.641 --> 00:34:25.190
<v Speaker 3>I've got to go this direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

915
00:34:25.191 --> 00:34:26.024
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pressure I think on female fighters </v>

916
00:34:27.561 --> 00:34:31.240
<v Speaker 3>and it wasn't exactly an outright </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure to to know,</v>

917
00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.390
<v Speaker 3>be sexy or be hot or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

918
00:34:33.391 --> 00:34:35.630
<v Speaker 3>And then I tried that so hard when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>first started fighting.</v>

919
00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:36.723
<v Speaker 3>Like I took the nude pictures and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to be the sexy girl and I just </v>

920
00:34:38.721 --> 00:34:41.060
<v Speaker 3>could not pull it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see in my face,</v>

921
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:42.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doofy girl,</v>

922
00:34:42.411 --> 00:34:43.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have that.</v>

923
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:44.503
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

924
00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:48.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm a huge fan of sex and sexuality and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how people want to express it.</v>

925
00:34:48.261 --> 00:34:49.094
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for me it just had nothing to do </v>

926
00:34:50.691 --> 00:34:51.680
<v Speaker 3>with combat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

927
00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:52.730
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fighters,</v>

928
00:34:52.731 --> 00:34:54.710
<v Speaker 3>the female fighters who could combine </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

929
00:34:54.711 --> 00:34:55.760
<v Speaker 3>to me it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

930
00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I was befuddled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

931
00:34:57.171 --> 00:34:58.004
<v Speaker 3>how do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do they put that together like that </v>

932
00:35:00.051 --> 00:35:00.920
<v Speaker 3>and still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

933
00:35:00.921 --> 00:35:04.250
<v Speaker 3>feel tough or still feel ferocious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I mean,</v>

934
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:07.490
<v Speaker 3>sex is ridiculously fun and sexuality is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like awesome,</v>

935
00:35:07.491 --> 00:35:08.720
<v Speaker 3>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

936
00:35:08.721 --> 00:35:11.420
<v Speaker 3>it's not punching people in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it was,</v>

937
00:35:11.421 --> 00:35:12.800
<v Speaker 3>and I would always compare myself to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

938
00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.180
<v Speaker 3>I should do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should do that,</v>

939
00:35:14.181 --> 00:35:15.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can't do that.</v>

940
00:35:15.441 --> 00:35:17.000
<v Speaker 3>It's just inauthentic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

941
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.110
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

942
00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:18.943
<v Speaker 3>authenticity is just like weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge part of my life that I'm trying to </v>

943
00:35:22.131 --> 00:35:25.190
<v Speaker 3>study with my writing and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>

944
00:35:25.191 --> 00:35:26.570
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny how,</v>

945
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:30.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would see them just like karate hottie</v>

946
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.270
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she came into the gym,</v>

947
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm into Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shorter.</v>

948
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.311
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michelle waterson.</v>

949
00:35:34.311 --> 00:35:34.701
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

950
00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:35.900
<v Speaker 3>Michelle don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

951
00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:37.920
<v Speaker 3>we call her nuts or peanut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

952
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.533
<v Speaker 1>Tina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

953
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.040
<v Speaker 1>because she's so little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

954
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:41.903
<v Speaker 1>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

955
00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.280
<v Speaker 1>when she came to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was just like little hooters model.</v>

956
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.470
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fucking system?</v>

957
00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:47.680
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost conard like Hickman.</v>

958
00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:49.230
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then she,</v>

959
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:51.480
<v Speaker 1>I had a black eye when we were sparring </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time.</v>

960
00:35:51.481 --> 00:35:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Then she gave me another black guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right away,</v>

961
00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:54.060
<v Speaker 1>the first time sparring just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam,</v>

962
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.800
<v Speaker 1>kicked me right in the face and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

963
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:56.880
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like her.</v>

964
00:35:56.881 --> 00:35:57.714
<v Speaker 1>But I was also like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had these hangups about it because I </v>

965
00:35:59.311 --> 00:36:00.144
<v Speaker 1>was so uncomfortable with that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing and that way of presenting </v>

966
00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:04.560
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also women weren't in the UFC then,</v>

967
00:36:04.561 --> 00:36:06.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our opportunities were so weird and so I</v>

968
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:07.674
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would question people who would push </v>

969
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.860
<v Speaker 1>that side of themselves so much and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>not I'm the fighter woman,</v>

970
00:36:13.861 --> 00:36:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this.</v>

971
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.110
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

972
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Is My space then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is embarrassing.</v>

973
00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.690
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then um,</v>

974
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.770
<v Speaker 1>it's funny cause I had this tension with</v>
<v Speaker 1>her because I was like,</v>

975
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to market myself in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

976
00:36:28.351 --> 00:36:31.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not who I am exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to mma.</v>

977
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.180
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

978
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.710
<v Speaker 1>of course greg sense that there was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortableness between us and he took</v>

979
00:36:37.711 --> 00:36:40.200
<v Speaker 1>us up to the top of the mountain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>made us run sprints until we were crying</v>

980
00:36:40.201 --> 00:36:41.700
<v Speaker 1>and holding onto each other and became </v>
<v Speaker 1>sisters.</v>

981
00:36:41.701 --> 00:36:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Like it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just like,</v>

982
00:36:42.871 --> 00:36:44.730
<v Speaker 1>all that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are sisters,</v>

983
00:36:44.731 --> 00:36:46.560
<v Speaker 1>your training partners is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're here for each other.</v>

984
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.720
<v Speaker 1>And it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like an something clicked in</v>

985
00:36:48.721 --> 00:36:49.890
<v Speaker 1>my mind where I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

986
00:36:49.891 --> 00:36:51.960
<v Speaker 1>she can promote herself however the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wants to.</v>

987
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:54.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

988
00:36:54.691 --> 00:36:57.420
<v Speaker 1>She's [inaudible] that's how she is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's who she is.</v>

989
00:36:57.421 --> 00:36:59.910
<v Speaker 1>She was a model like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was her profession before this.</v>

990
00:36:59.911 --> 00:37:01.120
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

991
00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.013
<v Speaker 1>it made a lot more sense to me when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could step back out of what the boxes </v>

992
00:37:05.581 --> 00:37:06.414
<v Speaker 1>that I had placed myself under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The container's not necessarily boxes </v>

993
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.353
<v Speaker 1>cause it can feel closed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the containers that I was </v>

994
00:37:10.741 --> 00:37:14.280
<v Speaker 1>comfortable working within for myself or</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same for the person next to me.</v>

995
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:15.960
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

996
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:16.913
<v Speaker 1>it taught me to have a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect for people who want to combine </v>

997
00:37:20.791 --> 00:37:22.560
<v Speaker 1>everything the way they want to combine </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

998
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:23.583
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a natural inclination to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to shoot down potential rivals or </v>

999
00:37:26.971 --> 00:37:28.160
<v Speaker 1>potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1000
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:31.050
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at people and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to pick apart what they do.</v>

1001
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of ways when you're a fighter,</v>

1002
00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.000
<v Speaker 1>you have predatory instincts.</v>

1003
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:36.901
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must,</v>

1004
00:37:36.901 --> 00:37:39.180
<v Speaker 1>when you're sizing up a pewter opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1005
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.063
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you're not looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>things they do wrong or things that you </v>

1006
00:37:42.751 --> 00:37:44.460
<v Speaker 1>think you can exploit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe,</v>

1007
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:45.653
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe she doesn't work hard enough or </v>

1008
00:37:47.191 --> 00:37:49.710
<v Speaker 1>maybe she misses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait because her disciplines off.</v>

1009
00:37:49.711 --> 00:37:50.544
<v Speaker 1>And you start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start looking for holes in their </v>

1010
00:37:52.351 --> 00:37:53.184
<v Speaker 1>game and you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do that with a rival in </v>

1011
00:37:54.811 --> 00:37:56.490
<v Speaker 1>the gym as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you are an eight.</v>

1012
00:37:56.491 --> 00:37:58.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even go so far to say we were</v>

1013
00:37:58.081 --> 00:38:00.120
<v Speaker 1>rivals is I was 30 pounds heavier than </v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

1014
00:38:00.121 --> 00:38:01.690
<v Speaker 1>so I was just a bully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1015
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:03.323
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth of matter is also because </v>

1016
00:38:04.891 --> 00:38:07.020
<v Speaker 1>especially the early terrain of women in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sport,</v>

1017
00:38:07.021 --> 00:38:08.730
<v Speaker 1>when there was another woman who came </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the gym,</v>

1018
00:38:08.731 --> 00:38:12.330
<v Speaker 1>this can either be your best training </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner other or ever,</v>

1019
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.280
<v Speaker 1>or it could be somebody coming in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1020
00:38:14.281 --> 00:38:15.690
<v Speaker 1>to pick up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

1021
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:17.610
<v Speaker 1>And I'm think men look at the gym that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way too.</v>

1022
00:38:17.611 --> 00:38:18.444
<v Speaker 1>I think that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they size each other up in the gym with </v>

1023
00:38:19.591 --> 00:38:21.060
<v Speaker 1>a new partner coming in and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1024
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:25.080
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting because it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>so sexist when I say it,</v>

1025
00:38:25.081 --> 00:38:27.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to lie,</v>

1026
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.680
<v Speaker 1>sit here and lie to you and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1027
00:38:28.681 --> 00:38:29.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

1028
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.290
<v Speaker 1>when other women would come into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gym,</v>

1029
00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:32.250
<v Speaker 1>I would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

1030
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.233
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that evolved over time and especially </v>

1031
00:38:34.561 --> 00:38:37.780
<v Speaker 1>because the atmosphere that greg created</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was incredible.</v>

1032
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Like I was the first mma girl really in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gym.</v>

1033
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.270
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1034
00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:45.580
<v Speaker 1>and then Michelle was there and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people and now it's like there's a</v>

1035
00:38:45.581 --> 00:38:49.000
<v Speaker 1>huge women's team over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it like to be sparring with men</v>

1036
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:49.834
<v Speaker 1>when you were the first woman there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be doing most of your training with men </v>

1037
00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:54.070
<v Speaker 1>and then going in there fighting women?</v>

1038
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.320
<v Speaker 1>They were all sizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1039
00:38:56.321 --> 00:38:58.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think training with women is important</v>

1040
00:38:58.091 --> 00:39:00.580
<v Speaker 1>if you're fighting women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's a different kind of</v>

1041
00:39:00.581 --> 00:39:02.650
<v Speaker 1>intensity and flexibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1042
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:03.603
<v Speaker 1>in body types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know that that's completely </v>

1043
00:39:05.381 --> 00:39:06.214
<v Speaker 1>across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did find it better to have female </v>

1044
00:39:07.631 --> 00:39:08.464
<v Speaker 1>sparring partners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was very fortunate in that Holly </v>

1045
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Holm was at the gym boxing and she could</v>
<v Speaker 1>kick box and she knew how to sprawl.</v>

1046
00:39:14.081 --> 00:39:16.660
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was still getting sparring with,</v>

1047
00:39:16.661 --> 00:39:18.550
<v Speaker 1>with women there and Jodie Esquibel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1048
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.863
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1049
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.000
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was fighting at one oh five.</v>

1050
00:39:22.001 --> 00:39:22.834
<v Speaker 1>And I remember Keith had me spa her for </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 rounds and she dropped me twice and </v>

1051
00:39:24.891 --> 00:39:29.260
<v Speaker 1>one oh five or I have terrible chin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I would just say just box like this</v>

1052
00:39:29.261 --> 00:39:31.800
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I used to eight karate style.</v>

1053
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1054
00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:36.000
<v Speaker 1>So hard to get out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a really good job.</v>

1055
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:36.963
<v Speaker 1>I was rarely knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the jaw that I put in front </v>

1056
00:39:39.221 --> 00:39:41.200
<v Speaker 1>of people constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always like,</v>

1057
00:39:41.201 --> 00:39:42.034
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit me.</v>

1058
00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever think about doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional boxing?</v>

1059
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.341
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

1060
00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:46.450
<v Speaker 1>I thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1061
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:47.710
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1062
00:39:47.711 --> 00:39:49.390
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause there was a quite,</v>

1063
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:53.170
<v Speaker 1>quite a few female boxers in that gym </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought it would be an interesting</v>

1064
00:39:53.171 --> 00:39:54.910
<v Speaker 1>thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just never took that path.</v>

1065
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:55.983
<v Speaker 1>I was an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a pretty decent boxing sparring </v>

1066
00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:57.911
<v Speaker 1>partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1067
00:39:57.911 --> 00:39:59.260
<v Speaker 1>I learned how to imitate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1068
00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:01.540
<v Speaker 1>their opponents and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1069
00:40:01.541 --> 00:40:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I think I was always better in the gym </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I actually wasn't competition.</v>

1070
00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout your career,</v>

1071
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:07.893
<v Speaker 1>did you worry at all about head trauma?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you worry about the consequences of </v>

1072
00:40:10.981 --> 00:40:11.790
<v Speaker 1>until after?</v>

1073
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Not Til after it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until after.</v>

1074
00:40:13.121 --> 00:40:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why after?</v>

1075
00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Cause you didn't want to think about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>or was he conscious decision and I think</v>

1076
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.130
<v Speaker 1>you have that mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be anyone in anything,</v>

1077
00:40:21.131 --> 00:40:22.330
<v Speaker 1>even your own body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1078
00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:25.510
<v Speaker 1>So it was like I'm not going to let that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of negativity into my life if I get</v>

1079
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:26.350
<v Speaker 1>knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1080
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.840
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my last fight I do remember,</v>

1081
00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my jaw was out a little bit.</v>

1082
00:40:30.911 --> 00:40:31.744
<v Speaker 1>I had like somebody just adjust my job </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I kept getting dropped in the </v>

1083
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:35.560
<v Speaker 1>sparring for my last fight and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

1084
00:40:35.561 --> 00:40:37.720
<v Speaker 1>oh this sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you got your jaw.</v>

1085
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:38.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1086
00:40:38.351 --> 00:40:40.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno there was a chiropractor on hand</v>

1087
00:40:40.481 --> 00:40:42.730
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know how legit it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't legit.</v>

1088
00:40:42.731 --> 00:40:44.770
<v Speaker 1>He seems like a really nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was an Ortho therapist and he said,</v>

1089
00:40:44.771 --> 00:40:45.670
<v Speaker 1>your jaws offline.</v>

1090
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:48.460
<v Speaker 1>And then he like did some kind of thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I stopped getting dropped,</v>

1091
00:40:48.461 --> 00:40:51.360
<v Speaker 1>which was nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't really jive.</v>

1092
00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:52.443
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know how much of that was </v>

1093
00:40:53.831 --> 00:40:55.880
<v Speaker 1>psychosomatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1094
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:56.920
<v Speaker 1>And me just thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1095
00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:59.350
<v Speaker 1>this is what fixes me getting dropped or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1096
00:40:59.351 --> 00:41:00.184
<v Speaker 1>But I did think towards the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I got dropped three times inspiring </v>

1097
00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:06.070
<v Speaker 1>before the fight with [inaudible] and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was in one day and I was like,</v>

1098
00:41:06.071 --> 00:41:07.150
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1099
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll know.</v>

1100
00:41:09.551 --> 00:41:11.590
<v Speaker 1>They pulled me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have to stop now,</v>

1101
00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.530
<v Speaker 1>you think after the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1102
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't think everybody was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a big sparring room.</v>

1103
00:41:15.701 --> 00:41:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1104
00:41:16.961 --> 00:41:18.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people are paying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much attention.</v>

1105
00:41:18.401 --> 00:41:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot going on then when you get</v>

1106
00:41:20.201 --> 00:41:22.240
<v Speaker 1>dropped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it a flash knockdown or did you feel</v>

1107
00:41:22.241 --> 00:41:23.074
<v Speaker 1>your legs go flash knockdown?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever been completely </v>

1108
00:41:26.351 --> 00:41:28.120
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1109
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:31.270
<v Speaker 1>I yawned limp and then gotten back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1110
00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same thing.</v>

1111
00:41:32.921 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

1112
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.510
<v Speaker 3>don't recognize your weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1113
00:41:35.511 --> 00:41:38.030
<v Speaker 3>You don't recognize that your brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>could have problems,</v>

1114
00:41:38.031 --> 00:41:38.731
<v Speaker 3>you don't reckon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1115
00:41:38.731 --> 00:41:38.860
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1116
00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.370
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as you're walking and moving,</v>

1117
00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:42.210
<v Speaker 2>you have to keep going for.</v>

1118
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that mentality,</v>

1119
00:41:43.901 --> 00:41:45.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1120
00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.673
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to disrespect that </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentality because I think that's also </v>

1121
00:41:49.481 --> 00:41:50.314
<v Speaker 3>the mentality that makes champions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you never became a champion and </v>

1122
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:56.980
<v Speaker 3>you went through that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of wonder,</v>

1123
00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:59.220
<v Speaker 3>I didn't make great choices with my life</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

1124
00:41:59.290 --> 00:41:59.631
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1125
00:41:59.631 --> 00:42:00.320
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1126
00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're saying rings true to</v>

1127
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.360
<v Speaker 2>pretty much anybody that follows a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sport.</v>

1128
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Like we really admire those Diego </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sanchez warriors.</v>

1129
00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diego Sanchez fight.</v>

1130
00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:13.790
<v Speaker 2>And I'm watching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1131
00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.650
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want my kid to fight the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>he fights.</v>

1132
00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1133
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.070
<v Speaker 2>diego fights like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a God damn human wolverine.</v>

1134
00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:19.971
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

1135
00:42:19.971 --> 00:42:23.330
<v Speaker 2>he's just a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just charge forward.</v>

1136
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:24.680
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1137
00:42:24.681 --> 00:42:26.780
<v Speaker 2>and he's been stopped and he's lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

1138
00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:27.580
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1139
00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:28.413
<v Speaker 2>It's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ferocity and which he approaches </v>

1140
00:42:30.911 --> 00:42:32.650
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1141
00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.710
<v Speaker 2>it's heart and will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just determination.</v>

1142
00:42:35.711 --> 00:42:40.711
<v Speaker 2>And it's all together in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this indomitable spirit package.</v>

1143
00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:42.490
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>

1144
00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.473
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diego might not be a world champion and </v>

1145
00:42:44.801 --> 00:42:45.634
<v Speaker 2>you might not ever win a world title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the amount of fans that guy has won </v>

1146
00:42:48.851 --> 00:42:50.950
<v Speaker 2>just by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when he's so entertaining,</v>

1147
00:42:50.951 --> 00:42:51.784
<v Speaker 2>like if what you're trying to see when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're watching two people fight is one </v>

1148
00:42:54.881 --> 00:42:55.714
<v Speaker 2>person try to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>triumph over the obstacle in front of </v>

1149
00:42:59.621 --> 00:43:01.090
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the person over the,</v>

1150
00:43:01.091 --> 00:43:01.924
<v Speaker 2>the body that wants to stop over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lungs that are burning over the legs </v>

1151
00:43:06.341 --> 00:43:07.174
<v Speaker 2>that are giving out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1152
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:09.500
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that rings true now in </v>
<v Speaker 3>entertainment,</v>

1153
00:43:09.501 --> 00:43:11.220
<v Speaker 3>in sports?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that the uh,</v>

1154
00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.610
<v Speaker 3>the UFC or Belgium or whatever show is </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1155
00:43:13.611 --> 00:43:15.470
<v Speaker 3>do you think that that's still what </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are looking for</v>

1156
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.270
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes.</v>

1157
00:43:17.271 --> 00:43:18.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't always look for it.</v>

1158
00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:19.873
<v Speaker 2>Like I got criticized because people </v>
<v Speaker 2>said that the Tyron Woodley Stephen </v>

1159
00:43:23.181 --> 00:43:24.620
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy Thompson fight wasn't a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1160
00:43:24.621 --> 00:43:26.090
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while that fight was going on,</v>

1161
00:43:26.091 --> 00:43:26.924
<v Speaker 2>I was on the edge of my seat because at </v>
<v Speaker 2>any moment it could have gotten amazing </v>

1162
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:30.643
<v Speaker 2>at any moment.</v>

1163
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.150
<v Speaker 3>Dan doing well before their techniques </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost.</v>

1164
00:43:33.151 --> 00:43:34.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean not consciously doing mad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

1165
00:43:34.561 --> 00:43:35.394
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1166
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.680
<v Speaker 3>they're adjusting to each other and </v>
<v Speaker 3>second of the fight.</v>

1167
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1168
00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.920
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it,</v>

1169
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.640
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that wonderboy was playing this very</v>

1170
00:43:42.641 --> 00:43:43.474
<v Speaker 2>conservative stay on the outside thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Tyron Woodley in order to close the </v>

1171
00:43:46.391 --> 00:43:48.070
<v Speaker 2>distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a risk getting hit and he got hit</v>

1172
00:43:48.071 --> 00:43:50.980
<v Speaker 2>a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was a fascinating fight to me,</v>

1173
00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:52.173
<v Speaker 2>but people don't want chess matches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want the last minute of the last </v>

1174
00:43:54.971 --> 00:43:55.804
<v Speaker 2>round when Tyron connected and Wonderboy</v>
<v Speaker 2>was wobbling and looked like he was </v>

1175
00:43:58.811 --> 00:44:00.100
<v Speaker 2>going out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they want.</v>

1176
00:44:00.101 --> 00:44:03.610
<v Speaker 2>They want slobber knocker rocky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially people that don't train,</v>

1177
00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.130
<v Speaker 2>they just just watch the sport and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just think,</v>

1178
00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1179
00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.190
<v Speaker 2>I want to see somebody get their ass </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicked.</v>

1180
00:44:09.191 --> 00:44:10.024
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't care that someone is using </v>

1181
00:44:11.861 --> 00:44:12.694
<v Speaker 2>amazing foot work or that someone has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different style than what </v>

1182
00:44:15.701 --> 00:44:16.534
<v Speaker 2>people are used to wonder why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that sideways sport sport karate </v>

1183
00:44:19.721 --> 00:44:23.710
<v Speaker 2>stance so difficult to decipher when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's also so good at timing.</v>

1184
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:24.543
<v Speaker 2>It is his sliding in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And out movement is so good and his </v>

1185
00:44:26.981 --> 00:44:28.650
<v Speaker 2>ground is very good too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just,</v>

1186
00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:30.470
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have to go there that often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1187
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1188
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.830
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan of the whole thing.</v>

1189
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:36.600
<v Speaker 2>I like all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like wars.</v>

1190
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:37.463
<v Speaker 2>I liked tactical matches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a guy like mighty mouse who just </v>

1191
00:44:40.171 --> 00:44:41.700
<v Speaker 2>barely ever gets hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1192
00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:43.083
<v Speaker 2>And I like someone like Diego that comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>out biting down on his mouthpiece and </v>

1193
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.500
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1194
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.530
<v Speaker 2>it could be covered in blood and he just</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights harder.</v>

1195
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:50.503
<v Speaker 2>Diego Sanchez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one more third rounds when he got his </v>

1196
00:44:52.381 --> 00:44:53.530
<v Speaker 2>ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first two,</v>

1197
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.160
<v Speaker 2>like anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Gilbert Melendez fight,</v>

1198
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.473
<v Speaker 2>you know that Jake Ellenberger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the last minute of the fight </v>

1199
00:45:00.061 --> 00:45:01.380
<v Speaker 2>he's on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jake ellenberger is back,</v>

1200
00:45:01.381 --> 00:45:03.330
<v Speaker 2>punched him in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1201
00:45:03.331 --> 00:45:08.250
<v Speaker 2>He's just so ferocious at the Martin </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marvin Kamin.</v>

1202
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martin Kampmann fight.</v>

1203
00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Martin Kampmann had him like his face </v>
<v Speaker 2>was hanging off,</v>

1204
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:17.520
<v Speaker 2>it was hanging off and he's still </v>
<v Speaker 2>chasing them down to third round.</v>

1205
00:45:17.521 --> 00:45:19.110
<v Speaker 2>Might just nobody more ferocious than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1206
00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>

1207
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:21.390
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's the times like that,</v>

1208
00:45:21.391 --> 00:45:25.770
<v Speaker 3>like how can you not admire that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can you not want to see that or find</v>

1209
00:45:25.771 --> 00:45:28.290
<v Speaker 3>something in yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that the will not give up.</v>

1210
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:29.573
<v Speaker 3>That if you're at the brink of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean not necessarily death because </v>

1211
00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:33.450
<v Speaker 3>it's just an enactment right of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1212
00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Let's be real though and we don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1213
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:39.680
<v Speaker 2>we were kind of being nice about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is kind of at the brink of death.</v>

1214
00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean Robbie Mcdonnell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robbie lawler and Rory Macdonald,</v>

1215
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:46.340
<v Speaker 2>that was to me the brink of death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>

1216
00:45:46.341 --> 00:45:51.080
<v Speaker 2>you're getting really close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those guys were fucking going to war and</v>

1217
00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:51.914
<v Speaker 2>when Rorys knows caved in and blood's </v>
<v Speaker 2>pouring out of his face and he just </v>

1218
00:45:55.071 --> 00:45:56.840
<v Speaker 2>collapses and he couldn't take it </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1219
00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:59.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far away from death is that?</v>

1220
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.580
<v Speaker 2>It's an a couple blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the same neighbor.</v>

1221
00:46:01.581 --> 00:46:03.620
<v Speaker 2>You could see death from there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

1222
00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:04.943
<v Speaker 3>But does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're watching it or when you're </v>

1223
00:46:05.881 --> 00:46:07.290
<v Speaker 3>analyzing a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you feel,</v>

1224
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.110
<v Speaker 3>does that feel differently than when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>first started?</v>

1225
00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.960
<v Speaker 3>I guess watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>analyzing when you see these moments now</v>

1226
00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:13.940
<v Speaker 2>feels bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1227
00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:14.351
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1228
00:46:14.351 --> 00:46:16.190
<v Speaker 2>it does bother me when I know them too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1229
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:18.530
<v Speaker 2>you know when I know them too well and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1230
00:46:18.531 --> 00:46:21.260
<v Speaker 2>I see them getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I see a fight like,</v>

1231
00:46:21.261 --> 00:46:24.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Rory Macdonald,</v>

1232
00:46:24.381 --> 00:46:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Robbie Lawler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why no?</v>

1233
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoever wins this fight.</v>

1234
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Neither one of those guys going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same again.</v>

1235
00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:34.010
<v Speaker 2>They gave a part of who they were in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fight and you know,</v>

1236
00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:36.660
<v Speaker 2>Don fries said that once about his fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>with uh,</v>

1237
00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Ken shamrock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1238
00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:40.393
<v Speaker 2>whoever won that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter because we both lost </v>

1239
00:46:42.861 --> 00:46:44.600
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We both lost who,</v>

1240
00:46:44.601 --> 00:46:48.280
<v Speaker 2>whoever we were when we went in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we weren't at the same guy when we left.</v>

1241
00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:50.510
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you know that we left </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1242
00:46:50.511 --> 00:46:51.860
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if Ken's going to admit it,</v>

1243
00:46:51.861 --> 00:46:53.900
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost something in there.</v>

1244
00:46:53.901 --> 00:46:55.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the same person anymore.</v>

1245
00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1246
00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.770
<v Speaker 3>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1247
00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.180
<v Speaker 3>it's so much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm,</v>

1248
00:46:59.181 --> 00:47:00.014
<v Speaker 3>I'm working on so many writing projects </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now and so many things that I'm </v>

1249
00:47:02.431 --> 00:47:05.040
<v Speaker 3>trying to analyze mma from such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different perspective now,</v>

1250
00:47:05.041 --> 00:47:08.700
<v Speaker 3>but if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they've sacrificed to that canvas,</v>

1251
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.610
<v Speaker 3>like what they've given,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all of these fighters,</v>

1252
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:12.444
<v Speaker 3>all of these grades and all of these not</v>
<v Speaker 3>greats who've still given that part of </v>

1253
00:47:14.641 --> 00:47:16.260
<v Speaker 3>themselves to that canvas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And You wonder,</v>

1254
00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:18.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the payback exactly.</v>

1255
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:20.780
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you get from that Tori?</v>

1256
00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.093
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1257
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:24.450
<v Speaker 2>What are those moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those moments in the,</v>

1258
00:47:24.451 --> 00:47:28.290
<v Speaker 2>and also this understanding that you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>the type of person that can persevere.</v>

1259
00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:30.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1260
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:33.850
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've settled the world basically,</v>

1261
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:34.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been all over the world.</v>

1262
00:47:34.931 --> 00:47:36.940
<v Speaker 1>We know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know the world,</v>

1263
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:38.440
<v Speaker 1>we know space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting out there,</v>

1264
00:47:38.441 --> 00:47:40.000
<v Speaker 1>we're figuring those things out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these are the,</v>

1265
00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:41.043
<v Speaker 1>almost the worlds and the spaces and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>glories let that fight for glory in </v>

1266
00:47:43.841 --> 00:47:47.650
<v Speaker 1>these strange heterotopic spaces that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>create for ourselves.</v>

1267
00:47:47.651 --> 00:47:49.860
<v Speaker 1>So that what's a heterotopic space?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

1268
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:50.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1269
00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:51.940
<v Speaker 1>it's a full cult thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1270
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1271
00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is like,</v>

1272
00:47:53.981 --> 00:47:54.814
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just gonna actually ask you with </v>

1273
00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:58.210
<v Speaker 1>podcasting and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a space that's other sort of,</v>

1274
00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:02.350
<v Speaker 1>that you create an environment that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than the norm sort of in a way.</v>

1275
00:48:02.351 --> 00:48:05.490
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of hard for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like non hegemonic.</v>

1276
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's um,</v>

1277
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:11.270
<v Speaker 2>for unusual outside the box space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1278
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.350
<v Speaker 2>Strange environment.</v>

1279
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:13.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a,</v>

1280
00:48:13.531 --> 00:48:15.060
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

1281
00:48:15.061 --> 00:48:18.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a controlled utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Heterotopia like it,</v>

1282
00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.520
<v Speaker 1>it kind of molds those two ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1283
00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:21.443
<v Speaker 1>And like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like I was going to ask you to kind </v>

1284
00:48:22.801 --> 00:48:23.880
<v Speaker 1>of about podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that,</v>

1285
00:48:23.881 --> 00:48:24.714
<v Speaker 1>cause you kind of create one when your </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice goes out over the air and when </v>

1286
00:48:27.781 --> 00:48:30.780
<v Speaker 1>you're doing these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're entering into people's heads.</v>

1287
00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:33.000
<v Speaker 1>You yourself in a way or your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your voices.</v>

1288
00:48:33.001 --> 00:48:35.730
<v Speaker 1>And it's creating this space that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>other where they're connected with you.</v>

1289
00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1290
00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just an other space and it's,</v>

1291
00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:41.820
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that fighting,</v>

1292
00:48:41.821 --> 00:48:44.010
<v Speaker 1>and I think the cage is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that as well.</v>

1293
00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:45.690
<v Speaker 1>I think it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1294
00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.240
<v Speaker 1>it's this new avenue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this new area.</v>

1295
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.133
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel so troubled when it comes to the </v>

1296
00:48:51.541 --> 00:48:52.374
<v Speaker 1>commercialization of it all because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder if people are still fighting for </v>

1297
00:48:55.141 --> 00:48:55.974
<v Speaker 1>Gloria and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are they or are they fighting for </v>

1298
00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:00.090
<v Speaker 1>the pretty pictures?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1299
00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can't ask people.</v>

1300
00:49:01.771 --> 00:49:04.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really want the answers to that.</v>

1301
00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.950
<v Speaker 1>I want to know why people still fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I did it.</v>

1302
00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:09.003
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody has their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>different reasons and sometimes those </v>

1303
00:49:10.661 --> 00:49:11.494
<v Speaker 2>reasons don't serve you well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when Ronda Rousey came back and </v>

1304
00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:18.220
<v Speaker 2>when she fought Amanda Nunez and all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lead up was all about Ronda Rousey.</v>

1305
00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:19.054
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was also about her getting back </v>

1306
00:49:20.831 --> 00:49:23.170
<v Speaker 2>to being the best in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>

1307
00:49:23.171 --> 00:49:24.004
<v Speaker 2>I was watching all that and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be world champion because </v>

1308
00:49:26.741 --> 00:49:28.630
<v Speaker 2>fighting is the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was watching,</v>

1309
00:49:28.631 --> 00:49:29.261
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1310
00:49:29.261 --> 00:49:33.190
<v Speaker 2>this all on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean I'm keeping my mind open.</v>

1311
00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:34.301
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1312
00:49:34.301 --> 00:49:36.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited to see that she's in great </v>
<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>

1313
00:49:36.491 --> 00:49:37.324
<v Speaker 2>She's coming back fully motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not excited that she hasn't made any </v>

1314
00:49:40.271 --> 00:49:41.650
<v Speaker 2>changes to our camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1315
00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:42.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see what happens.</v>

1316
00:49:42.701 --> 00:49:46.780
<v Speaker 2>She's got amazing judo and she was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>world beater for a real reason,</v>

1317
00:49:46.781 --> 00:49:49.040
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the red flags are there,</v>

1318
00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:50.770
<v Speaker 2>although wrong.</v>

1319
00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1320
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Nothing about the actual world champion </v>
<v Speaker 1>who exactly who.</v>

1321
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like an eye.</v>

1322
00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I freaking Adore Ronda Rousey and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means my teammate,</v>

1323
00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:02.780
<v Speaker 1>like holly is the one who night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how did you thrown to her?</v>

1324
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.823
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I adore Rhonda and what she's done and </v>

1325
00:50:05.331 --> 00:50:06.830
<v Speaker 1>the things that she's done in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentality.</v>

1326
00:50:06.831 --> 00:50:11.831
<v Speaker 1>That's a Diego Sanchez mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not In the way that cheese she</v>

1327
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.133
<v Speaker 2>got used to a very specific thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening when she fought was her </v>

1328
00:50:17.261 --> 00:50:18.094
<v Speaker 2>dominating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when that didn't happen in that one </v>

1329
00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:20.681
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1330
00:50:20.681 --> 00:50:21.514
<v Speaker 2>she tried her best against holly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but holly fought the perfect fight and </v>

1331
00:50:23.621 --> 00:50:25.420
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ronda fought the wrong fight.</v>

1332
00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely wrong.</v>

1333
00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:28.600
<v Speaker 2>The wrong way to fight holly charge at </v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

1334
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:29.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With the,</v>

1335
00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:30.123
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1336
00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:32.660
<v Speaker 3>I and holly was so ready for that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>

1337
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.220
<v Speaker 3>she was ready for that fight for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1338
00:50:34.221 --> 00:50:34.630
<v Speaker 3>I can</v>

1339
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:36.790
<v Speaker 2>see that I could just see in her knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She fought perfect.</v>

1340
00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:37.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was literally a flawless </v>

1341
00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:39.270
<v Speaker 2>performance by all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1342
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:43.900
<v Speaker 2>So she loses that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She gets devastated and chalks it off to</v>

1343
00:50:43.901 --> 00:50:46.990
<v Speaker 2>lack of training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chalks it off to distractions.</v>

1344
00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:50.380
<v Speaker 2>So this time she's going to do no media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going to do no interviews,</v>

1345
00:50:50.381 --> 00:50:53.230
<v Speaker 2>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go in there and just be bulldog.</v>

1346
00:50:53.231 --> 00:50:54.064
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you,</v>

1347
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:58.840
<v Speaker 2>you see like the discussions about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight and you see,</v>

1348
00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:00.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1349
00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:01.720
<v Speaker 2>you know that we're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're behind the scenes.</v>

1350
00:51:01.721 --> 00:51:03.730
<v Speaker 2>They were all convinced that she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to steam roll.</v>

1351
00:51:03.731 --> 00:51:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Amanda Nunez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was so many people back there.</v>

1352
00:51:05.921 --> 00:51:07.330
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are out of your fucking mind.</v>

1353
00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:08.763
<v Speaker 2>I was saying before the holly fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then Amanda was probably the most </v>

1354
00:51:10.991 --> 00:51:11.824
<v Speaker 2>dangerous fight for because a man is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really fucking good on the ground and </v>

1355
00:51:15.701 --> 00:51:16.534
<v Speaker 2>her standup is vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she got brutal knockout power and </v>

1356
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.820
<v Speaker 2>she's a long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she throws,</v>

1357
00:51:21.821 --> 00:51:25.420
<v Speaker 2>he's long ass punches and she catches </v>
<v Speaker 2>you on the end of these punches.</v>

1358
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:26.583
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's up nightmare for Rhonda because </v>

1359
00:51:27.791 --> 00:51:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda likes to stand up and bra to </v>
<v Speaker 2>close the distance.</v>

1360
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:33.670
<v Speaker 2>And the name of your close the diseases </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Amanda Nunez is no picnic.</v>

1361
00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:34.720
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1362
00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:36.930
<v Speaker 3>Amanda's got actually a very good clench</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a very,</v>

1363
00:51:36.931 --> 00:51:37.764
<v Speaker 3>a very good awareness of where her body </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes and hurt her center of gravity </v>

1364
00:51:40.351 --> 00:51:41.730
<v Speaker 3>seems to be she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

1365
00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:43.980
<v Speaker 3>She's so long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to be a little bit lower than,</v>

1366
00:51:43.981 --> 00:51:44.814
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be very hard to launch </v>

1367
00:51:46.231 --> 00:51:47.064
<v Speaker 3>her on her head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although Zingano did very well with the </v>

1368
00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:51.780
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>belly to belly.</v>

1369
00:51:51.781 --> 00:51:53.130
<v Speaker 3>Suplex that's what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1370
00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:54.483
<v Speaker 3>I got to remember that</v>

1371
00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:56.840
<v Speaker 2>one other woman who's fucking ferocious </v>
<v Speaker 2>as hell.</v>

1372
00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:57.773
<v Speaker 2>Cats in Ghana.</v>

1373
00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.370
<v Speaker 3>So much intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember,</v>

1374
00:52:00.371 --> 00:52:02.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I first met her in Colorado.</v>

1375
00:52:02.321 --> 00:52:05.230
<v Speaker 3>We were on the same fight show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was when I filmed tap out and I tried</v>

1376
00:52:05.231 --> 00:52:07.510
<v Speaker 3>to go say hi to her because Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another female fighter,</v>

1377
00:52:07.511 --> 00:52:08.344
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we weren't fighting each other and she </v>

1378
00:52:08.651 --> 00:52:10.000
<v Speaker 3>just totally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

1379
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.863
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a bitch.</v>

1380
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.713
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I got to know her better and </v>

1381
00:52:12.741 --> 00:52:14.530
<v Speaker 3>she just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she is an amazing person.</v>

1382
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.061
<v Speaker 3>She is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She is.</v>

1383
00:52:16.061 --> 00:52:17.680
<v Speaker 3>She had a fight coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't wanna talk to anybody.</v>

1384
00:52:17.681 --> 00:52:19.410
<v Speaker 3>She didn't want to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know who I was,</v>

1385
00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:21.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know who she was and we weren't</v>

1386
00:52:21.011 --> 00:52:21.844
<v Speaker 3>gonna talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1387
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:22.863
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I just got to absolutely adore </v>

1388
00:52:23.621 --> 00:52:24.550
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1389
00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:27.180
<v Speaker 3>back to Rhonda and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1390
00:52:27.181 --> 00:52:31.330
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Diego Sanchez,</v>

1391
00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:33.880
<v Speaker 3>like kind of the mentality that the bite</v>
<v Speaker 3>down in the third round,</v>

1392
00:52:33.881 --> 00:52:36.400
<v Speaker 3>I think you have something there where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you pushed when it's against you.</v>

1393
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:38.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wonder that something that,</v>

1394
00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:41.230
<v Speaker 3>that knockout interrupted her or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1395
00:52:41.231 --> 00:52:42.064
<v Speaker 3>when holly got her an interrupted her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her forward progression and then going </v>

1396
00:52:44.651 --> 00:52:45.484
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulling back away from the media and </v>

1397
00:52:46.631 --> 00:52:49.360
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost wonder if that in itself was</v>

1398
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:54.920
<v Speaker 3>kind of a denial of that interruption </v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe uh,</v>

1399
00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.150
<v Speaker 3>trying to create a space for herself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1400
00:52:57.151 --> 00:52:57.984
<v Speaker 3>I'm so obsessed with this idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>creating our own spaces and what we're </v>

1401
00:52:59.851 --> 00:53:00.684
<v Speaker 3>doing in our own lives because </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's so different than </v>

1402
00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:03.420
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1403
00:53:03.421 --> 00:53:04.890
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what she was trying to,</v>

1404
00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:05.993
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plot out the way to this fight and to </v>

1405
00:53:08.371 --> 00:53:09.204
<v Speaker 3>waive this victory against Amanda Nunez </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not being distracted and not doing </v>

1406
00:53:11.251 --> 00:53:13.980
<v Speaker 3>press and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I almost think if she'd had done the</v>

1407
00:53:13.981 --> 00:53:16.020
<v Speaker 3>press,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is just a theory,</v>

1408
00:53:16.021 --> 00:53:17.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know her that well.</v>

1409
00:53:17.221 --> 00:53:21.210
<v Speaker 3>I think she's a lovely person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if she had done the of sheet,</v>

1410
00:53:21.211 --> 00:53:22.620
<v Speaker 3>exposed herself to all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1411
00:53:22.621 --> 00:53:23.454
<v Speaker 3>if she wouldn't have had more of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>triumphant attitude because she would </v>

1412
00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:32.490
<v Speaker 3>have known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you know what it's like to lose and</v>

1413
00:53:32.491 --> 00:53:35.970
<v Speaker 3>you know that you can still get up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>next day and be okay and,</v>

1414
00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:37.093
<v Speaker 3>and face the people who you said a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million things to a million confident </v>

1415
00:53:39.901 --> 00:53:40.734
<v Speaker 3>thanks to and and you're wrong or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were wrong for a night and understand </v>

1416
00:53:45.241 --> 00:53:47.580
<v Speaker 3>that you can actually still get them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see your side.</v>

1417
00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:49.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that makes any sense.</v>

1418
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:50.610
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

1419
00:53:50.611 --> 00:53:52.410
<v Speaker 2>I see where you're going with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1420
00:53:52.411 --> 00:53:53.244
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a bunch of problems </v>

1421
00:53:54.901 --> 00:53:57.850
<v Speaker 2>technically with how she's preparing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

1422
00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I think her work with Edmond made her </v>
<v Speaker 2>look really good on the mets,</v>

1423
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:04.133
<v Speaker 2>but there's a big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking good on the mats and having a </v>

1424
00:54:07.561 --> 00:54:11.580
<v Speaker 2>bunch of different options tactically </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in a fight.</v>

1425
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.780
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of that comes with </v>
<v Speaker 2>just long,</v>

1426
00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:17.273
<v Speaker 2>long sessions in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of experience and years and years </v>

1427
00:54:20.281 --> 00:54:21.390
<v Speaker 2>of sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And fighting,</v>

1428
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:22.493
<v Speaker 2>but she was just go forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go forward to tackle forward attack and </v>

1429
00:54:25.771 --> 00:54:28.140
<v Speaker 2>when she started getting hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she didn't have any answers.</v>

1430
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:29.273
<v Speaker 2>She was like throwing up this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>push away front kick and moving away </v>

1431
00:54:31.981 --> 00:54:32.814
<v Speaker 2>against Amanda and she was kind of done </v>
<v Speaker 2>from like the first couple of punches </v>

1432
00:54:35.101 --> 00:54:40.101
<v Speaker 2>landed and I think that if you look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>real seasoned strikers,</v>

1433
00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:44.700
<v Speaker 2>you know like like a good example would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

1434
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:46.860
<v Speaker 2>oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of good examples,</v>

1435
00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:47.694
<v Speaker 2>but you want to get in j check and a her</v>
<v Speaker 2>last fight against Carolina Kibawe </v>

1436
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:52.110
<v Speaker 2>Kovich okay.</v>

1437
00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:57.110
<v Speaker 2>That that is two very seasoned strikers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of like a lot of faints.</v>

1438
00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:01.020
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of different angles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of different approaches.</v>

1439
00:55:01.021 --> 00:55:03.630
<v Speaker 2>He was try one way that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go over here.</v>

1440
00:55:03.631 --> 00:55:04.464
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go over here now I've got </v>

1441
00:55:05.821 --> 00:55:06.990
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's try that again.</v>

1442
00:55:06.991 --> 00:55:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Went to the well too many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try back to this again.</v>

1443
00:55:09.241 --> 00:55:09.850
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

1444
00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:12.450
<v Speaker 2>it was a communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like there's a conversation going</v>

1445
00:55:12.451 --> 00:55:13.284
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're seeing a lot of fighters is </v>

1446
00:55:15.691 --> 00:55:19.110
<v Speaker 2>they're shouting out one or two words </v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not articulate.</v>

1447
00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:20.183
<v Speaker 2>Meaning their approach is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you see someone and they just keep </v>

1448
00:55:23.101 --> 00:55:24.840
<v Speaker 2>going to the big right hand over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top,</v>

1449
00:55:24.841 --> 00:55:25.674
<v Speaker 2>big right hand over the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're just banking on this </v>

1450
00:55:28.321 --> 00:55:29.154
<v Speaker 2>one thing and someone is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to figure out that approach and it </v>

1451
00:55:32.311 --> 00:55:33.930
<v Speaker 2>might not be the person that's right in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of you,</v>

1452
00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:34.973
<v Speaker 2>but someone who's really good is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to find their way through that and </v>

1453
00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:40.180
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be able to talk circles</v>
<v Speaker 2>around you.</v>

1454
00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:41.013
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk all the time about when I watch </v>

1455
00:55:43.171 --> 00:55:44.580
<v Speaker 2>finding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to break it down objectively.</v>

1456
00:55:44.581 --> 00:55:45.414
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying what it mirrors in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways is communication and that really </v>

1457
00:55:49.111 --> 00:55:52.770
<v Speaker 2>truly articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that have a long list,</v>

1458
00:55:52.771 --> 00:55:53.604
<v Speaker 2>the long history of using a deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>vocabulary are way better off with a </v>

1459
00:55:57.421 --> 00:56:00.600
<v Speaker 2>nuanced conversation than someone who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1460
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.370
<v Speaker 2>they might be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get off my lawn.</v>

1461
00:56:02.371 --> 00:56:03.204
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might be able to yell out one </v>

1462
00:56:04.141 --> 00:56:04.974
<v Speaker 2>phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how can they adapt to someone who's </v>

1463
00:56:07.381 --> 00:56:10.080
<v Speaker 2>passive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can they adapt to someone who tricks</v>

1464
00:56:10.081 --> 00:56:12.450
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can they adapt to someone who paints</v>

1465
00:56:12.451 --> 00:56:15.360
<v Speaker 2>them into a corner and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you figure your way out of a trap?</v>

1466
00:56:15.361 --> 00:56:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand a trap?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you see it in fighting,</v>

1467
00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:20.880
<v Speaker 2>you see people getting set up and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see things happening.</v>

1468
00:56:20.881 --> 00:56:21.714
<v Speaker 2>Like Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Anderson Silva was a master at </v>

1469
00:56:24.491 --> 00:56:25.324
<v Speaker 2>setting people up in a master of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like figuring out the language of what </v>

1470
00:56:28.511 --> 00:56:29.440
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

1471
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:30.303
<v Speaker 2>Like what's your thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what you could see him when he was </v>

1472
00:56:31.841 --> 00:56:34.010
<v Speaker 2>moving with guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would stand south Paul,</v>

1473
00:56:34.011 --> 00:56:35.740
<v Speaker 2>he would switch up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he moved around,</v>

1474
00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:38.050
<v Speaker 2>he would give you a little of this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he just tried to Jay.</v>

1475
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:39.063
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually he'd figure out your</v>
<v Speaker 2>rhythm and then start dropping shit on </v>

1476
00:56:41.951 --> 00:56:43.570
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he did,</v>

1477
00:56:43.571 --> 00:56:44.404
<v Speaker 2>it was masterful to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause here's a guy that had figured out </v>

1478
00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:50.710
<v Speaker 2>whatever rhythm Yuron he'd figured out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the symphony of your movements.</v>

1479
00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:52.113
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's beautiful and I think that </v>

1480
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:54.630
<v Speaker 1>describing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1481
00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:57.070
<v Speaker 1>as a conversation with another person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect.</v>

1482
00:56:57.071 --> 00:56:59.010
<v Speaker 1>It is a dialogue between two people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1483
00:56:59.100 --> 00:56:59.933
<v Speaker 1>it's a dialogue of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of physicality and strength and stuff </v>

1484
00:57:01.781 --> 00:57:02.750
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's it,</v>

1485
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:04.780
<v Speaker 1>there's a conversation happening there </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the cage.</v>

1486
00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:09.340
<v Speaker 1>And I think when we go back to maybe the</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of,</v>

1487
00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:13.210
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that Ronda Rousey's </v>
<v Speaker 1>training might have been a little bit to</v>

1488
00:57:13.211 --> 00:57:14.890
<v Speaker 1>boxing oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that she didn't throw kicks,</v>

1489
00:57:14.891 --> 00:57:17.890
<v Speaker 1>not that she didn't use her judo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she didn't prepare for chaos.</v>

1490
00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:18.753
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boxers always prepare for chaos </v>

1491
00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:24.040
<v Speaker 1>because it's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a layered this step,</v>

1492
00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:25.270
<v Speaker 1>you move your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your foot this way,</v>

1493
00:57:25.271 --> 00:57:27.070
<v Speaker 1>you move your foot this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move your head this way,</v>

1494
00:57:27.071 --> 00:57:28.180
<v Speaker 1>you respond this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's,</v>

1495
00:57:28.181 --> 00:57:30.120
<v Speaker 1>it's so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you see boxers like,</v>

1496
00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:32.620
<v Speaker 1>like Tyson who could throw that double </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1497
00:57:32.621 --> 00:57:33.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1498
00:57:33.001 --> 00:57:35.470
<v Speaker 1>the hook to the body and then the upper </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut and stuff like that.</v>

1499
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:38.380
<v Speaker 1>He could prepare for the chaos cause he </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't bring chaos.</v>

1500
00:57:38.381 --> 00:57:39.214
<v Speaker 1>And I think that in her early fights </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheet there was chaos there because she </v>

1501
00:57:41.441 --> 00:57:43.420
<v Speaker 1>wasn't as sure of herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1502
00:57:43.421 --> 00:57:45.970
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to get what I need to get and that</v>

1503
00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:47.193
<v Speaker 1>unsettled fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when she got more comfortable </v>

1504
00:57:48.611 --> 00:57:49.444
<v Speaker 1>with hitting the Mitts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she got more comfortable with them </v>

1505
00:57:50.321 --> 00:57:51.154
<v Speaker 1>moving forward and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having everything laid out for her </v>

1506
00:57:53.261 --> 00:57:54.410
<v Speaker 1>perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do this,</v>

1507
00:57:54.411 --> 00:57:56.020
<v Speaker 1>you're going to start this person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to happen.</v>

1508
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm making a lot of assumptions </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1509
00:57:57.461 --> 00:57:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I never trained with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1510
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:59.820
<v Speaker 1>I never sparred with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1511
00:57:59.821 --> 00:58:00.654
<v Speaker 1>I see what I've been presented by UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>media and commercials and I do as well </v>

1512
00:58:04.931 --> 00:58:06.780
<v Speaker 1>as well as people that I know the train </v>
<v Speaker 1>were there.</v>

1513
00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Didn't like the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1514
00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:09.723
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it was just a little bit to an </v>

1515
00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.273
<v Speaker 1>unrealistic and that's I think what </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the conversation between old </v>

1516
00:58:16.371 --> 00:58:17.204
<v Speaker 1>school emma man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in mma right now with </v>

1517
00:58:18.551 --> 00:58:20.530
<v Speaker 1>commercialization and it's worldwide.</v>

1518
00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.120
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on one hand,</v>

1519
00:58:22.121 --> 00:58:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy for the fighters that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting paid more that,</v>

1520
00:58:24.731 --> 00:58:26.230
<v Speaker 1>that the opportunities are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1521
00:58:26.231 --> 00:58:27.064
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to worry about crappy </v>

1522
00:58:27.461 --> 00:58:29.110
<v Speaker 1>sponsors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not a huge reebok fan,</v>

1523
00:58:29.111 --> 00:58:30.730
<v Speaker 1>but whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not my business like,</v>

1524
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:32.140
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1525
00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:33.003
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1526
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.110
<v Speaker 1>they don't prepare for chaos anymore as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

1527
00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.810
<v Speaker 1>And Chaos was what we thrived on back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>

1528
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:38.673
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know who we were going to </v>

1529
00:58:39.641 --> 00:58:40.474
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fought three pill and one in three </v>

1530
00:58:41.201 --> 00:58:42.034
<v Speaker 1>people in one night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One time I lost a fight and then the </v>

1531
00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:46.990
<v Speaker 1>next day I took a kickboxing fight cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so mad I lost an MMA fight.</v>

1532
00:58:46.991 --> 00:58:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Like there was no regulation and I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>have gotten seriously injured.</v>

1533
00:58:50.381 --> 00:58:51.214
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time it was that chaos </v>

1534
00:58:53.381 --> 00:58:54.214
<v Speaker 1>that was so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like finding where you are in the chaos </v>

1535
00:58:56.261 --> 00:58:57.094
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finding your own patterns in that </v>

1536
00:58:59.030 --> 00:59:00.820
<v Speaker 1>and preparing for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1537
00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.433
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the old school mma that I miss a </v>

1538
00:59:04.571 --> 00:59:06.470
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While there's definitely something</v>

1539
00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.820
<v Speaker 2>interesting and fascinating about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos,</v>

1540
00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:12.030
<v Speaker 2>but there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about a professional</v>

1541
00:59:12.031 --> 00:59:14.790
<v Speaker 2>and when you're talking about someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a world champion in particular,</v>

1542
00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:20.300
<v Speaker 2>there's real value in preparation for an</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual opponent,</v>

1543
00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:21.293
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you switch up at opponent last men </v>

1544
00:59:23.191 --> 00:59:24.024
<v Speaker 2>and or something happens like when conor</v>
<v Speaker 2>mcgregor last minute wasn't facing </v>

1545
00:59:26.901 --> 00:59:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Hofeld dose on Joe Saul's son who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>facing Nate Diaz on 11 days notice.</v>

1546
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of chaos is,</v>

1547
00:59:32.401 --> 00:59:33.980
<v Speaker 2>is completely different animal.</v>

1548
00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:35.850
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree with you and you know,</v>

1549
00:59:35.851 --> 00:59:38.160
<v Speaker 3>I might be contradicting myself here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't care.</v>

1550
00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:40.410
<v Speaker 3>Because also when Jon Jones were </v>
<v Speaker 3>ejected,</v>

1551
00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:41.130
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight,</v>

1552
00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:41.963
<v Speaker 3>the initial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when jail was supposed to step in </v>

1553
00:59:43.591 --> 00:59:44.520
<v Speaker 3>for him and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1554
00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:45.930
<v Speaker 3>that's not what my team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1555
00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:49.320
<v Speaker 3>once and he got so much shit for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the whole event got cancelled at the</v>

1556
00:59:49.321 --> 00:59:49.980
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

1557
00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:52.140
<v Speaker 3>that's a pretty smart professional move </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make.</v>

1558
00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:54.410
<v Speaker 2>It is and it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1559
00:59:54.411 --> 00:59:57.710
<v Speaker 2>I think John also didn't want to risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>reward chill sign and for all that shit.</v>

1560
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:59.323
<v Speaker 2>But my thought is John Jones smokes jail</v>
<v Speaker 2>sign and if you wake them up at five </v>

1561
01:00:02.241 --> 01:00:03.950
<v Speaker 2>o'clock in the morning after he's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>out drinking,</v>

1562
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:04.851
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1563
01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:07.120
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think they're in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>stratosphere.</v>

1564
01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.510
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so either.</v>

1565
01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:10.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do think that that,</v>

1566
01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:11.683
<v Speaker 3>although it was a move that affected a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people negatively who were </v>

1567
01:00:13.731 --> 01:00:16.130
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be on that card and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>affected the company negatively,</v>

1568
01:00:16.131 --> 01:00:21.131
<v Speaker 3>it was a very big power move and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>also a move towards saying,</v>

1569
01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.190
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1570
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:24.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm more professional than this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that to me.</v>

1571
01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1572
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:27.200
<v Speaker 2>But if I was in John's corner opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to me,</v>

1573
01:00:27.201 --> 01:00:28.470
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the motherfuckers.</v>

1574
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:31.010
<v Speaker 2>All motherfuckers go out there and smash</v>
<v Speaker 2>that dude.</v>

1575
01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.490
<v Speaker 3>The person who was with the people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>his corner,</v>

1576
01:00:34.491 --> 01:00:37.010
<v Speaker 3>I would say they're going to do things </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they see best for him.</v>

1577
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:37.701
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1578
01:00:37.701 --> 01:00:40.970
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's not the rumble Johnson.</v>

1579
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:42.300
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's also the way,</v>

1580
01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.770
<v Speaker 3>that's also the ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not prepared specifically,</v>

1581
01:00:45.771 --> 01:00:46.341
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1582
01:00:46.341 --> 01:00:47.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm going back to what I was saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the chaos,</v>

1583
01:00:47.721 --> 01:00:48.554
<v Speaker 3>but you have to train for chaos and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>do have to be prepared specifically for </v>

1584
01:00:50.931 --> 01:00:52.160
<v Speaker 3>opponents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're very right in that.</v>

1585
01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.660
<v Speaker 3>You have to know what somebody is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

1586
01:00:53.661 --> 01:00:55.370
<v Speaker 3>That's how holly was so successful about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda.</v>

1587
01:00:55.371 --> 01:00:57.260
<v Speaker 3>She knew every move that was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come her way.</v>

1588
01:00:57.290 --> 01:00:58.123
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that when you switch things </v>

1589
01:00:59.661 --> 01:01:03.470
<v Speaker 3>up on such a level where it was that big</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a fight,</v>

1590
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.300
<v Speaker 3>somebody he'd been preparing for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Henderson,</v>

1591
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.313
<v Speaker 3>it was Henderson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1592
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:07.483
<v Speaker 3>Am I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John was spinning Henderson and one 57 </v>

1593
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.110
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were a lot of fights fighting.</v>

1594
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:17.230
<v Speaker 3>Who thought it was who had to pull out a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of fights.</v>

1595
01:01:18.711 --> 01:01:20.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1596
01:01:20.331 --> 01:01:22.430
<v Speaker 3>I know jail came in and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a quest guy,</v>

1597
01:01:22.431 --> 01:01:23.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's supposed to be Dan Henderson.</v>

1598
01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Really thought so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a quest guy.</v>

1599
01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:27.860
<v Speaker 3>Did Dan Henderson and Jones ever fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1600
01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:29.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it was hundred.</v>

1601
01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.710
<v Speaker 3>I could be completely mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1602
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:31.603
<v Speaker 2>Dan Henderson did fight Daniel cormier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that fight and Daniel just </v>

1603
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:36.890
<v Speaker 2>sorta ragdoll I'm all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1604
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who the hell John was </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to fight.</v>

1605
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:40.183
<v Speaker 3>It just seemed as though those are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moments where a legacy can be very </v>

1606
01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:44.954
<v Speaker 3>shaken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now John's done his own work of shaking </v>

1607
01:01:46.671 --> 01:01:50.630
<v Speaker 3>up his own legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John just needs someone to talk to.</v>

1608
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.393
<v Speaker 3>I think that we all make poor choices </v>
<v Speaker 3>and some people's poor choices are a </v>

1609
01:01:55.821 --> 01:01:57.260
<v Speaker 3>little bit bigger than other people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>four choices.</v>

1610
01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.213
<v Speaker 2>Well and is also wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Motherfuckers do wild motherfucker shit </v>

1611
01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.500
<v Speaker 2>like you want some do two opens up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shogun,</v>

1612
01:02:03.501 --> 01:02:06.860
<v Speaker 2>with a flying knee when he's 22 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>old and catch a Shogun on the chin.</v>

1613
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:09.080
<v Speaker 2>That's Jon Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

1614
01:02:09.081 --> 01:02:09.914
<v Speaker 2>that whole wild man thing is the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>why he's so God damn good in the first </v>

1615
01:02:13.281 --> 01:02:14.114
<v Speaker 2>place because he has amazing confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What makes John's special is like the </v>

1616
01:02:18.171 --> 01:02:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Gustafson fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fight that he admittedly was in shitty</v>

1617
01:02:21.151 --> 01:02:22.950
<v Speaker 2>shape for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really wasn't training,</v>

1618
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:25.350
<v Speaker 2>was partying way too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't really paying attention,</v>

1619
01:02:25.351 --> 01:02:29.370
<v Speaker 2>didn't think Gustafson can beat him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>got dragged deep into the fifth round.</v>

1620
01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Still wound up winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't fold up.</v>

1621
01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.270
<v Speaker 2>He fought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1622
01:02:33.271 --> 01:02:36.150
<v Speaker 2>he wound up winning the fifth round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He winded up taking it to him.</v>

1623
01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:39.110
<v Speaker 2>He pulled that fight out and he made it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1624
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:39.861
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1625
01:02:39.861 --> 01:02:43.140
<v Speaker 2>us up sends a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like Gustafson was a pushover,</v>

1626
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:46.500
<v Speaker 2>but John Jones made that fight way </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder than it was.</v>

1627
01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:47.334
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not being conditioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being in shape and still got it it </v>

1628
01:02:49.591 --> 01:02:50.200
<v Speaker 2>out in one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1629
01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.033
<v Speaker 1>he had that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that part of him that I </v>

1630
01:02:53.771 --> 01:02:56.950
<v Speaker 1>hope he returns to that is all about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1631
01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know those Diego Sanchez </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments,</v>

1632
01:02:58.811 --> 01:02:59.910
<v Speaker 1>like when you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1633
01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.220
<v Speaker 1>it becomes your spirit that's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not just your body.</v>

1634
01:03:03.221 --> 01:03:04.054
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But something else has to take over and </v>

1635
01:03:04.811 --> 01:03:05.630
<v Speaker 1>take the reins</v>

1636
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:06.463
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two or popped his arm and beat the veto </v>

1637
01:03:08.071 --> 01:03:09.910
<v Speaker 2>or had his arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hyper extended.</v>

1638
01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was going to tab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1639
01:03:11.251 --> 01:03:12.530
<v Speaker 2>holy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was hoping I just,</v>

1640
01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:14.250
<v Speaker 2>do you want to see his arm break?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1641
01:03:14.251 --> 01:03:15.084
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And which is tow is half torn off in </v>

1642
01:03:17.321 --> 01:03:18.690
<v Speaker 2>that other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't know about that.</v>

1643
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.120
<v Speaker 2>He just didn't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's another level.</v>

1644
01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know about that until he was </v>

1645
01:03:23.101 --> 01:03:23.934
<v Speaker 2>doing the post fight interview and </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked down and saw his toe and he was </v>

1646
01:03:26.401 --> 01:03:27.031
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1647
01:03:27.031 --> 01:03:27.864
<v Speaker 2>And then we got him a stool and he sat </v>
<v Speaker 2>down on the stool and he was kind of in </v>

1648
01:03:30.211 --> 01:03:31.110
<v Speaker 2>shock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1649
01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always called him my little brother at</v>

1650
01:03:33.371 --> 01:03:34.760
<v Speaker 1>the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I always,</v>

1651
01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been,</v>

1652
01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>he's not my look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1653
01:03:37.541 --> 01:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been at the gym in a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1654
01:03:38.921 --> 01:03:39.510
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1655
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:43.470
<v Speaker 2>John is almost too talented for his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>good and surrounded by the wrong kind of</v>

1656
01:03:43.471 --> 01:03:44.700
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that he does that.</v>

1657
01:03:44.701 --> 01:03:46.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that he,</v>

1658
01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.470
<v Speaker 2>there's something about him that self </v>
<v Speaker 2>sabotages.</v>

1659
01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:49.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy.</v>

1660
01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.390
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to self sabotage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1661
01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:54.330
<v Speaker 2>it's like the pressure of being a Jon </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jones.</v>

1662
01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:57.000
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money that guy missed out on?</v>

1663
01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:58.441
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he's,</v>

1664
01:03:58.441 --> 01:03:59.274
<v Speaker 2>he's coming back in July and he'll most </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely be fighting the winter of Daniel </v>

1665
01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Cormier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Rung Rumble Johnson,</v>

1666
01:04:04.381 --> 01:04:06.780
<v Speaker 2>which is in a couple of months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they could do that in time.</v>

1667
01:04:06.781 --> 01:04:08.760
<v Speaker 2>Cause you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to go may,</v>

1668
01:04:08.761 --> 01:04:09.421
<v Speaker 2>June,</v>
<v Speaker 2>July,</v>

1669
01:04:09.421 --> 01:04:10.254
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it really depends on how this </v>

1670
01:04:11.611 --> 01:04:15.900
<v Speaker 2>fight goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he still has a chance to pull it off</v>

1671
01:04:15.901 --> 01:04:17.940
<v Speaker 2>and still has a chance to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest of all time.</v>

1672
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:23.070
<v Speaker 2>But he's fucked up pretty hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked John Though.</v>

1673
01:04:23.071 --> 01:04:25.170
<v Speaker 2>I just think John's around the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking people.</v>

1674
01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.130
<v Speaker 1>He's a good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that,</v>

1675
01:04:27.131 --> 01:04:28.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1676
01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.533
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we all wake up at some </v>

1677
01:04:31.511 --> 01:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>point and I just think his wakeup hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened yet.</v>

1678
01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:35.343
<v Speaker 1>Like even with maybe with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspensions and the stuff that he's </v>

1679
01:04:36.791 --> 01:04:38.830
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that he also tried very hard</v>

1680
01:04:39.730 --> 01:04:42.730
<v Speaker 1>to brand himself a certain way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1681
01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:44.830
<v Speaker 1>authenticity and authentic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>authenticity.</v>

1682
01:04:44.831 --> 01:04:47.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think that I'm sure that I,</v>

1683
01:04:47.001 --> 01:04:47.834
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a religious person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't really know how to say if </v>

1684
01:04:49.781 --> 01:04:52.930
<v Speaker 1>somebody is being Super Christian or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>being Super Christian and being whatever</v>

1685
01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:54.310
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they identify with.</v>

1686
01:04:54.311 --> 01:04:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not my,</v>

1687
01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.553
<v Speaker 1>that's not my knowledge sphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will say that it didn't seem the </v>

1688
01:04:59.231 --> 01:05:00.064
<v Speaker 1>things that he was saying didn't jive </v>
<v Speaker 1>with how he was and it came out and </v>

1689
01:05:02.741 --> 01:05:03.740
<v Speaker 1>people hated him for it.</v>

1690
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:04.703
<v Speaker 2>They did get mad at that because he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to present this goody two shoes </v>

1691
01:05:07.051 --> 01:05:09.000
<v Speaker 2>image and meanwhile he's a wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1692
01:05:09.001 --> 01:05:09.340
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1693
01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.173
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wild man is a respected figure in </v>

1694
01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:12.960
<v Speaker 2>and that made me respect it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a,</v>

1695
01:05:12.961 --> 01:05:13.794
<v Speaker 2>it's a vulnerable figure in society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Donald Cowboy cerrone is a perfect </v>

1696
01:05:16.141 --> 01:05:16.974
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1697
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:18.430
<v Speaker 2>Hundred percent on his sleeve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1698
01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:19.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1699
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:20.990
<v Speaker 3>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1700
01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.760
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a good dude.</v>

1701
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:23.750
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild man.</v>

1702
01:05:23.751 --> 01:05:26.300
<v Speaker 3>He has to have those rushes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has to have that,</v>

1703
01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.620
<v Speaker 3>that danger coming out him,</v>

1704
01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:28.603
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lives for it genuinely lives for it </v>

1705
01:05:30.181 --> 01:05:31.410
<v Speaker 2>and without it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't feel as,</v>

1706
01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:35.310
<v Speaker 2>as tuned in and doesn't feel as alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy fucking sport.</v>

1707
01:05:35.311 --> 01:05:37.290
<v Speaker 2>Julie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kedsey crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1715
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:52.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about these heterotopic </v>
<v Speaker 3>spaces and thinking about authenticity.</v>

1716
01:05:52.931 --> 01:05:54.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a person.</v>

1717
01:05:54.241 --> 01:05:55.720
<v Speaker 3>I was actually just going to email you </v>
<v Speaker 3>these questions.</v>

1718
01:05:55.721 --> 01:05:56.554
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well if I come in here I can plug </v>

1719
01:05:57.731 --> 01:06:00.460
<v Speaker 3>invicta and that would be great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I love plugging in victim,</v>

1720
01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.230
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1721
01:06:02.231 --> 01:06:03.820
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never really sat down and talked to</v>

1722
01:06:03.821 --> 01:06:07.510
<v Speaker 3>you and I guess who were you when this </v>
<v Speaker 3>started and who are you now?</v>

1723
01:06:07.511 --> 01:06:08.800
<v Speaker 3>Like are you the same person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1724
01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:11.330
<v Speaker 2>well I'm not the same person I was six </v>
<v Speaker 2>months ago.</v>

1725
01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:12.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1726
01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:13.873
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine if you're constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about things and constantly </v>

1727
01:06:17.211 --> 01:06:20.320
<v Speaker 2>growing and trying to reevaluate </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>

1728
01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:21.831
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1729
01:06:21.831 --> 01:06:22.664
<v Speaker 2>I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just a few years removed from </v>

1730
01:06:24.741 --> 01:06:28.100
<v Speaker 2>martial arts competition and kickboxing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and was doing some acting and stuff.</v>

1731
01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:29.143
<v Speaker 2>Did you train stand up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you sorta had to take a few acting </v>

1732
01:06:32.541 --> 01:06:33.374
<v Speaker 2>classes when I got a development deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was because I already had a </v>

1733
01:06:35.151 --> 01:06:36.830
<v Speaker 2>television show and so they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1734
01:06:36.831 --> 01:06:39.380
<v Speaker 2>you should learn how to act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really that.</v>

1735
01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:41.300
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was something that I trained for.</v>

1736
01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:42.141
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1737
01:06:42.141 --> 01:06:42.974
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing standup and I got a </v>

1738
01:06:43.701 --> 01:06:45.110
<v Speaker 2>development deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a sitcom.</v>

1739
01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:48.530
<v Speaker 2>And so then all of a sudden I found </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself out here and,</v>

1740
01:06:48.531 --> 01:06:49.311
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1741
01:06:49.311 --> 01:06:51.560
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I moved out here,</v>

1742
01:06:51.561 --> 01:06:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I was like 25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

1743
01:06:54.021 --> 01:06:54.854
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1744
01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:58.030
<v Speaker 2>And I was just trying to figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing,</v>

1745
01:06:58.031 --> 01:06:59.510
<v Speaker 2>like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my acting like this is,</v>

1746
01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:01.190
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1747
01:07:01.191 --> 01:07:04.490
<v Speaker 2>And then a couple of years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was 97,</v>

1748
01:07:04.491 --> 01:07:07.850
<v Speaker 2>I was training at Carlson Gracie's place</v>
<v Speaker 2>and [inaudible] was 19.</v>

1749
01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:08.871
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1750
01:07:08.871 --> 01:07:11.240
<v Speaker 2>he had just beaten John Hassle over in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii.</v>

1751
01:07:11.241 --> 01:07:13.350
<v Speaker 2>I was a white belt over there and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1752
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:14.263
<v Speaker 2>Mario Sperry train there and Carlos by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hereto and I'm Maria Lowe Bustamonte so </v>

1753
01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:19.490
<v Speaker 2>watch those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Train was amazing.</v>

1754
01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.730
<v Speaker 2>And this was back when no one knew any </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those guys where,</v>

1755
01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:23.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1756
01:07:23.721 --> 01:07:25.580
<v Speaker 2>it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting.</v>

1757
01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:28.070
<v Speaker 2>It was a really interesting to be a part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>

1758
01:07:28.071 --> 01:07:29.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>original Carlson Gracie,</v>

1759
01:07:30.290 --> 01:07:31.123
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jim and watch those guys work out </v>

1760
01:07:33.261 --> 01:07:35.870
<v Speaker 2>together and watch everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when,</v>

1761
01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:39.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC needed a post-fight interviewer,</v>

1762
01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:40.693
<v Speaker 2>they had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just had con one of the guys who </v>

1763
01:07:43.221 --> 01:07:44.054
<v Speaker 2>was one of the producers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Campbell Mclaren was friends with my </v>

1764
01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:50.350
<v Speaker 2>manager and they just casually mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and they brought it up to me and then</v>

1765
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:51.970
<v Speaker 2>we had a conference call and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck,</v>

1766
01:07:51.971 --> 01:07:52.550
<v Speaker 2>I'll do that.</v>

1767
01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want me to do?</v>

1768
01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.240
<v Speaker 2>And so the next thing you knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was flying out to Dothan,</v>

1769
01:07:56.241 --> 01:07:58.190
<v Speaker 2>Alabama on those little propeller </v>
<v Speaker 2>planes.</v>

1770
01:07:58.191 --> 01:07:59.780
<v Speaker 2>I was interviewing Mark Coleman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1771
01:07:59.781 --> 01:08:02.990
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watching vidor Belfort's debut.</v>

1772
01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.153
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1773
01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:08.210
<v Speaker 2>it was a fascinating time and to catch </v>
<v Speaker 2>mma sort of in,</v>

1774
01:08:08.211 --> 01:08:09.044
<v Speaker 2>it's transitioned from being the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacle that it once was just four </v>

1775
01:08:13.071 --> 01:08:17.080
<v Speaker 2>years prior to becoming a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Vitara entered the octagon.</v>

1776
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:18.830
<v Speaker 2>He had gloves on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1777
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Vito used to fight with shoes on </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes and got you were,</v>

1778
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:25.400
<v Speaker 2>you were still out of glad grab clothes </v>
<v Speaker 2>back then because I remember this guy,</v>

1779
01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:26.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

1780
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:30.320
<v Speaker 2>I forget who a volleyed Ishmael fought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1781
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:31.303
<v Speaker 2>he literally was grabbing his underwear </v>
<v Speaker 2>and his pants and giving them this like </v>

1782
01:08:36.471 --> 01:08:37.304
<v Speaker 2>intense wedgie while they were fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his cop was snapping and he was </v>

1783
01:08:40.341 --> 01:08:41.240
<v Speaker 2>totally legal.</v>

1784
01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1785
01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:45.650
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have to have gloves the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>classes were,</v>

1786
01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:47.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was only two weight classes.</v>

1787
01:08:47.061 --> 01:08:49.940
<v Speaker 2>I think back then it was real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was real,</v>

1788
01:08:49.941 --> 01:08:50.774
<v Speaker 2>it was weird to be there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was interesting and I did it for a </v>

1789
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:57.470
<v Speaker 2>couple of years and then it just doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem like it was going anywhere.</v>

1790
01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.750
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mma was stagnant.</v>

1791
01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:00.613
<v Speaker 2>It was removed from cable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could only get it if you had direct </v>

1792
01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:03.404
<v Speaker 2>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did it for two years and then I </v>

1793
01:09:05.721 --> 01:09:06.554
<v Speaker 2>quit and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went back to doing other stuff and just </v>

1794
01:09:09.831 --> 01:09:11.090
<v Speaker 2>sit calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on and stuff.</v>

1795
01:09:11.091 --> 01:09:11.924
<v Speaker 2>And then the UFC was purchased by </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and then I became friends </v>

1796
01:09:15.531 --> 01:09:16.364
<v Speaker 2>with Dana and went to a few shows and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then next thing you know he asked me to </v>

1797
01:09:19.461 --> 01:09:21.500
<v Speaker 2>do commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those weird things where I</v>

1798
01:09:21.501 --> 01:09:22.730
<v Speaker 2>have zero desire to do it.</v>

1799
01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:24.320
<v Speaker 2>I just was talking to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1800
01:09:24.321 --> 01:09:25.520
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know about this guy?</v>

1801
01:09:25.521 --> 01:09:27.320
<v Speaker 2>He's fighting over in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know about this guy,</v>

1802
01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.330
<v Speaker 2>this Russian dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know about this guy?</v>

1803
01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:30.350
<v Speaker 2>And he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1804
01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.193
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are these people you write things </v>

1805
01:09:31.641 --> 01:09:35.240
<v Speaker 2>down and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I was just balls deep in k one and</v>

1806
01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:36.560
<v Speaker 2>cried and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just,</v>

1807
01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.960
<v Speaker 2>I was always a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge fan.</v>

1808
01:09:38.961 --> 01:09:39.794
<v Speaker 2>And I had my friend Brian from Canada </v>
<v Speaker 2>would send me vhs tapes of all these </v>

1809
01:09:42.351 --> 01:09:44.510
<v Speaker 2>Japanese shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would just,</v>

1810
01:09:45.350 --> 01:09:47.510
<v Speaker 2>I was just a massive fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Hook can shoot days.</v>

1811
01:09:47.511 --> 01:09:51.770
<v Speaker 2>I watched all the hook and shoots all </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeff Osborne shows and uh,</v>

1812
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:53.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then somewhere around,</v>

1813
01:09:53.270 --> 01:09:55.670
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was 2002 when I was on fear </v>
<v Speaker 2>factor,</v>

1814
01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.950
<v Speaker 2>they asked me to do commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I've been doing it ever since.</v>

1815
01:09:58.580 --> 01:09:59.630
<v Speaker 2>So that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1816
01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:00.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

1817
01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:03.330
<v Speaker 3>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like do you ever look at your old stuff?</v>

1818
01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.940
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever consider like your mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>space then?</v>

1819
01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:10.140
<v Speaker 3>You mean like the old commentary stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>or just even think about it.</v>

1820
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:11.623
<v Speaker 2>Do my best every time I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but honestly what my contribution is is </v>

1821
01:10:14.241 --> 01:10:16.160
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1822
01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.180
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it's insignificant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not very important because what</v>

1823
01:10:20.181 --> 01:10:21.014
<v Speaker 2>it is is just me trying to do the best I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can describe what I see in front of me </v>

1824
01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.850
<v Speaker 2>to make it as entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as make it as entertaining as I can,</v>

1825
01:10:28.851 --> 01:10:31.010
<v Speaker 2>but also honor what's happening.</v>

1826
01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:33.100
<v Speaker 3>You're a conduit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the person.</v>

1827
01:10:33.101 --> 01:10:33.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1828
01:10:33.731 --> 01:10:35.380
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're where the flow of information has</v>

1829
01:10:35.381 --> 01:10:36.970
<v Speaker 3>to come through for the average viewer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1830
01:10:36.971 --> 01:10:38.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really admire that about you.</v>

1831
01:10:38.231 --> 01:10:39.064
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to suck up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your enthusiasm is something I </v>

1832
01:10:41.201 --> 01:10:44.040
<v Speaker 3>really tried to model myself after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

1833
01:10:44.050 --> 01:10:46.270
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we have,</v>

1834
01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:48.940
<v Speaker 3>like I'm nowhere near the level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>commentator that you are,</v>

1835
01:10:48.941 --> 01:10:51.070
<v Speaker 3>but when I hear you get excited about </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

1836
01:10:51.071 --> 01:10:53.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm really happy to hear that because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes me think,</v>

1837
01:10:53.021 --> 01:10:53.854
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as somebody who's communicating what's </v>

1838
01:10:56.171 --> 01:10:59.710
<v Speaker 3>happening in this sphere that so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people know about,</v>

1839
01:10:59.711 --> 01:11:00.544
<v Speaker 3>but so many people don't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand like what's going on if </v>

1840
01:11:02.231 --> 01:11:03.064
<v Speaker 3>somebody is clenched up or they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>grabbing a bicep here and why that's </v>

1841
01:11:05.111 --> 01:11:07.600
<v Speaker 3>important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why the way this fight or shifting their</v>

1842
01:11:07.601 --> 01:11:09.340
<v Speaker 3>hips is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1843
01:11:09.341 --> 01:11:09.911
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

1844
01:11:09.911 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 3>it's cool to see that kind of enthusiasm</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that I</v>

1845
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:14.813
<v Speaker 1>guess other people can get excited about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something without even knowing they're </v>

1846
01:11:16.501 --> 01:11:17.900
<v Speaker 1>getting excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're there.</v>

1847
01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:21.150
<v Speaker 1>The blood pressure comes up a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're watching and that's neat.</v>

1848
01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:23.340
<v Speaker 1>It's neat to see that cause it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine.</v>

1849
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:24.463
<v Speaker 2>All a hundred percent genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the only sport that I really </v>

1850
01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:27.830
<v Speaker 2>follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1851
01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:30.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't really even understand football.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's going on.</v>

1852
01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Like when the whistle blows or what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

1853
01:11:33.170 --> 01:11:34.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1854
01:11:34.971 --> 01:11:36.320
<v Speaker 2>people make fun of me all the time for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1855
01:11:36.321 --> 01:11:37.154
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not interesting to me when I'd </v>

1856
01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:41.030
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing,</v>

1857
01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.040
<v Speaker 2>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jiu Jitsu and mma,</v>

1858
01:11:43.041 --> 01:11:45.050
<v Speaker 2>watching all that takes up plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1859
01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't have time for anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>

1860
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:49.790
<v Speaker 2>And the consequences just aren't the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

1861
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.651
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1862
01:11:50.651 --> 01:11:53.510
<v Speaker 2>when I watch a kickboxing match or watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>an MMA fight,</v>

1863
01:11:53.511 --> 01:11:56.870
<v Speaker 2>the consequences are so extreme that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged,</v>

1864
01:11:56.871 --> 01:11:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm captivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with mma,</v>

1865
01:11:59.810 --> 01:12:00.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm watching it and I'm there live </v>

1866
01:12:02.601 --> 01:12:04.540
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm cage side and I'm,</v>

1867
01:12:04.541 --> 01:12:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching all this stuff go down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just watching,</v>

1868
01:12:08.631 --> 01:12:10.370
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also analyzing it.</v>

1869
01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:14.810
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to decipher patterns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying,</v>

1870
01:12:14.811 --> 01:12:17.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm data chunking and trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out what,</v>

1871
01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:18.003
<v Speaker 2>what could possibly happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I seeing in my projecting this </v>

1872
01:12:20.991 --> 01:12:21.824
<v Speaker 2>or am I actually seeing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just trying to be like as empty </v>

1873
01:12:24.141 --> 01:12:26.780
<v Speaker 2>about it as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also be so enthusiastic about it.</v>

1874
01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.530
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's moments like,</v>

1875
01:12:30.531 --> 01:12:33.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Darren Elkins beat [inaudible],</v>

1876
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.640
<v Speaker 2>it's just so hard for me not to cry </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the octagon.</v>

1877
01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:38.960
<v Speaker 2>It was so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1878
01:12:38.961 --> 01:12:39.800
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1879
01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:41.080
<v Speaker 2>but I was interviewing that do like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

1880
01:12:41.081 --> 01:12:42.620
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll start welling up right now.</v>

1881
01:12:42.621 --> 01:12:45.050
<v Speaker 2>When I was interviewing him after that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

1882
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:47.810
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy just emptied out.</v>

1883
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:51.200
<v Speaker 2>You mean emptied out his whole soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1884
01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:56.500
<v Speaker 2>he took up fucking beating for two and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>half rounds and didn't give up an inch.</v>

1885
01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:59.450
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no quit in him.</v>

1886
01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:00.650
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>

1887
01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:01.753
<v Speaker 2>And then filing the third round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he catches that guy and there's this </v>

1888
01:13:04.851 --> 01:13:05.684
<v Speaker 2>fucking roar that he did after that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight was stopped where he throws his </v>

1889
01:13:10.251 --> 01:13:13.370
<v Speaker 2>arm back and he's moving around the cage</v>
<v Speaker 2>and screaming.</v>

1890
01:13:13.371 --> 01:13:15.870
<v Speaker 2>He's covered in blood like right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1891
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1892
01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:23.290
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the purest human moments </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can ever see it,</v>

1893
01:13:23.291 --> 01:13:24.124
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1894
01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.240
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1895
01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:27.680
<v Speaker 1>you have to wipe tears off my hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1896
01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand that.</v>

1897
01:13:30.921 --> 01:13:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Like it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to,</v>

1898
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.903
<v Speaker 1>I guess to see your passion for that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see you are able to witness that and </v>

1899
01:13:37.611 --> 01:13:39.680
<v Speaker 1>you're still able to translate that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of passionate people.</v>

1900
01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Well if it stops being that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stop doing it.</v>

1901
01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:45.960
<v Speaker 2>But that was just last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it doesn't,</v>

1902
01:13:45.961 --> 01:13:48.570
<v Speaker 2>it just did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only is it not stopped,</v>

1903
01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.610
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when the fights are going on,</v>

1904
01:13:50.611 --> 01:13:53.550
<v Speaker 2>there's no waning whatsoever in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>enthusiasm.</v>

1905
01:13:53.551 --> 01:13:54.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't,</v>

1906
01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.880
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't dissipated and people think </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1907
01:13:56.881 --> 01:13:57.714
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of half and now because he </v>

1908
01:13:58.771 --> 01:14:01.830
<v Speaker 2>doesn't do all the events like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that can be further from the truth.</v>

1909
01:14:01.831 --> 01:14:02.790
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to travel.</v>

1910
01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.320
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also you're going to,</v>

1911
01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:05.243
<v Speaker 1>you're going to wear yourself down to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain point where it's just like </v>

1912
01:14:06.601 --> 01:14:07.434
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be too sick to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to experience what you need to </v>

1913
01:14:09.631 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>experience for the viewer to feel what's</v>

1914
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.480
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

1915
01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.160
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have too many interests.</v>

1916
01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:16.920
<v Speaker 2>I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to do too many things.</v>

1917
01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:17.880
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1918
01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to live five lives,</v>

1919
01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:21.563
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1920
01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.713
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you have the opportunity to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not does it does wear you thin a </v>

1921
01:14:27.431 --> 01:14:28.264
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you,</v>

1922
01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:30.670
<v Speaker 3>did you have that kind of passionate </v>
<v Speaker 3>connection with comedy?</v>

1923
01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:31.713
<v Speaker 3>Like when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're doing standup and when </v>

1924
01:14:32.711 --> 01:14:34.730
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in that kind of engagement,</v>

1925
01:14:34.731 --> 01:14:35.564
<v Speaker 3>do you feel that flow where you're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost to the point of emotion and you </v>

1926
01:14:37.721 --> 01:14:38.490
<v Speaker 3>want to cry?</v>

1927
01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:39.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like that.</v>

1928
01:14:39.631 --> 01:14:41.940
<v Speaker 2>That's different because it's a life or </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

1929
01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:44.490
<v Speaker 2>Like Dud Darren Elkins fight was life or</v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

1930
01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.710
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a different thing.</v>

1931
01:14:46.711 --> 01:14:49.110
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like comedy is fun.</v>

1932
01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:51.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like joyful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's silly.</v>

1933
01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:52.673
<v Speaker 2>It's important in that I know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people come out to see me and they pay </v>

1934
01:14:55.621 --> 01:14:56.454
<v Speaker 2>money and I want to do my best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important that I'm trying to </v>

1935
01:14:59.401 --> 01:15:03.510
<v Speaker 2>constantly improve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I do is I dump all our material out</v>

1936
01:15:03.511 --> 01:15:05.490
<v Speaker 2>every two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I ride a special,</v>

1937
01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:09.870
<v Speaker 2>I perform it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it tight and then I record it.</v>

1938
01:15:10.230 --> 01:15:12.090
<v Speaker 2>I put it on whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Netflix or whatever,</v>

1939
01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:13.150
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1940
01:15:13.151 --> 01:15:13.984
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I have to write a whole new </v>

1941
01:15:14.311 --> 01:15:15.144
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that process is a long and painful </v>

1942
01:15:16.741 --> 01:15:17.574
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I did my netflix special in </v>

1943
01:15:20.281 --> 01:15:21.990
<v Speaker 2>November.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It came out in November,</v>

1944
01:15:21.991 --> 01:15:25.350
<v Speaker 2>so it's been December,</v>
<v Speaker 2>January,</v>

1945
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.380
<v Speaker 2>February,</v>
<v Speaker 2>March.</v>

1946
01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:29.280
<v Speaker 2>We're four months in now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like on like fon legs.</v>

1947
01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:30.593
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just sort of like trotting along </v>

1948
01:15:32.431 --> 01:15:34.470
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really like a cult,</v>

1949
01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:36.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really like fully formed yet,</v>

1950
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:37.703
<v Speaker 2>but it will get fully formed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once it gets hardened and once </v>

1951
01:15:40.561 --> 01:15:43.350
<v Speaker 2>I know that it's ready to rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I could smash for an hour,</v>

1952
01:15:43.351 --> 01:15:44.184
<v Speaker 2>then I chuck it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a lot of intensity in </v>

1953
01:15:47.431 --> 01:15:49.710
<v Speaker 2>that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a different kind of intensity.</v>

1954
01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of,</v>

1955
01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:52.620
<v Speaker 2>it's a fun intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

1956
01:15:52.621 --> 01:15:54.750
<v Speaker 2>there's a motion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's,</v>

1957
01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:55.743
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes that don't go well and it's </v>

1958
01:15:57.091 --> 01:15:57.924
<v Speaker 2>painful and I don't enjoy that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also know that that's where the </v>

1959
01:16:00.871 --> 01:16:03.330
<v Speaker 2>growth comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like those shitty sets or with like some</v>

1960
01:16:03.331 --> 01:16:07.770
<v Speaker 2>of my biggest leaps have come from af </v>
<v Speaker 2>posts sets where it wasn't good.</v>

1961
01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:10.830
<v Speaker 2>And then I was sort of reengage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconnect and it got more fired up.</v>

1962
01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:12.750
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as that stops being </v>
<v Speaker 2>important to me,</v>

1963
01:16:12.751 --> 01:16:13.584
<v Speaker 2>I'll stop doing that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't have the same feeling </v>

1964
01:16:16.381 --> 01:16:17.670
<v Speaker 2>that fighting has fighting is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>

1965
01:16:17.671 --> 01:16:20.340
<v Speaker 2>is unique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unique moment.</v>

1966
01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:24.840
<v Speaker 2>This unique thing to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that Darren Elkins fight where it's</v>

1967
01:16:24.841 --> 01:16:25.440
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1968
01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:29.220
<v Speaker 2>there's not a whole lot of things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in the world that you can witness.</v>

1969
01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:30.373
<v Speaker 2>Where did that fucking intense and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the honor to try to do service </v>

1970
01:16:35.611 --> 01:16:36.600
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to,</v>

1971
01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:37.693
<v Speaker 3>I would say fighting is one of the few </v>
<v Speaker 3>arts or sports or however you wanna </v>

1972
01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:42.253
<v Speaker 3>phrase it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Experiences in the world where the </v>

1973
01:16:42.771 --> 01:16:46.340
<v Speaker 3>stakes are immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hi there laid out there.</v>

1974
01:16:46.341 --> 01:16:47.174
<v Speaker 3>The stakes are high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You win or lose isn't just win or lose </v>

1975
01:16:49.441 --> 01:16:51.890
<v Speaker 3>to a fighter and it's not win or lose to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fan.</v>

1976
01:16:51.891 --> 01:16:54.020
<v Speaker 3>Although you can step back and say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>or you can say,</v>

1977
01:16:54.021 --> 01:16:55.240
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just watching this for energy,</v>

1978
01:16:55.241 --> 01:16:58.640
<v Speaker 3>but you get invested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets so invested in it.</v>

1979
01:16:58.670 --> 01:17:00.800
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was kind of a lousy matchmaker in that</v>

1980
01:17:00.801 --> 01:17:02.990
<v Speaker 3>sense that I cared about the girls too </v>
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>

1981
01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:04.213
<v Speaker 3>I really did and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want anybody to lose ever and </v>

1982
01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:07.450
<v Speaker 3>it's was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1983
01:17:07.451 --> 01:17:10.280
<v Speaker 3>I was [inaudible] it was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With the math</v>

1984
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:10.971
<v Speaker 1>and the Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

1985
01:17:10.971 --> 01:17:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very,</v>

1986
01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:18.120
<v Speaker 3>very hyperactive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like not when I'm in the zone,</v>

1987
01:17:18.121 --> 01:17:19.800
<v Speaker 3>I can pay attention really well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I'm not,</v>

1988
01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:21.750
<v Speaker 3>it's I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mind is everywhere and I can't really</v>

1989
01:17:21.751 --> 01:17:24.660
<v Speaker 3>focus and I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't great in that respect.</v>

1990
01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:26.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

1991
01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:28.950
<v Speaker 3>when you see something come together </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

1992
01:17:28.951 --> 01:17:29.784
<v Speaker 3>when you see the fight actually happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it does matter who wins or who </v>

1993
01:17:32.911 --> 01:17:34.650
<v Speaker 3>loses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it also doesn't,</v>

1994
01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:35.484
<v Speaker 3>what matters is just watching that </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical engagement and these people </v>

1995
01:17:37.831 --> 01:17:41.610
<v Speaker 3>perform at their not performing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are performing.</v>

1996
01:17:41.670 --> 01:17:42.870
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1997
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:44.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a cat is an art.</v>

1998
01:17:45.190 --> 01:17:47.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when Meryl Streep was saying that,</v>

1999
01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my may is not the arts.</v>

2000
01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not painting,</v>

2001
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:53.180
<v Speaker 2>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's art.</v>

2002
01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2003
01:17:53.410 --> 01:17:54.980
<v Speaker 1>It's on a damn canvas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2004
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean really it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

2005
01:17:57.491 --> 01:17:58.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a contained,</v>

2006
01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:01.950
<v Speaker 1>these actions are being performed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

2007
01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:03.770
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may not be what</v>

2008
01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:04.673
<v Speaker 3>we identify as art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but neither is the person in the modern </v>

2009
01:18:07.651 --> 01:18:09.870
<v Speaker 3>art with the TV or whatever you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about earlier.</v>

2010
01:18:09.871 --> 01:18:10.704
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2011
01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:14.890
<v Speaker 2>you see a fight like me should tape </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus Holly Holm.</v>

2012
01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:15.933
<v Speaker 2>When Misha take takes holly home down in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fifth round locks that choke in and </v>

2013
01:18:20.681 --> 01:18:23.980
<v Speaker 2>holly doesn't even tab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's throwing punches in the air as she</v>

2014
01:18:23.981 --> 01:18:26.470
<v Speaker 2>goes on conscious and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people on the outside,</v>

2015
01:18:26.471 --> 01:18:27.610
<v Speaker 2>they would look at that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2016
01:18:27.611 --> 01:18:29.710
<v Speaker 2>that's just barbaric and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent.</v>

2017
01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:30.873
<v Speaker 2>But you see Misha tate getting that belt</v>
<v Speaker 2>strapped around her waist and her </v>

2018
01:18:34.481 --> 01:18:35.314
<v Speaker 2>reaction,</v>

2019
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:36.970
<v Speaker 3>oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They the her whole life,</v>

2020
01:18:36.971 --> 01:18:37.940
<v Speaker 3>she was the strike force team.</v>

2021
01:18:38.530 --> 01:18:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Rosie came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2022
01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:44.130
<v Speaker 1>You bantamweight champion other wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2023
01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:46.020
<v Speaker 1>she was climbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She summited the highest</v>

2024
01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.810
<v Speaker 3>mountain that she could summit in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2025
01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:48.890
<v Speaker 3>It was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2026
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:50.910
<v Speaker 2>There was art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way I described mma,</v>

2027
01:18:50.911 --> 01:18:53.700
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my definition is it's high level problem</v>

2028
01:18:53.701 --> 01:18:57.240
<v Speaker 2>solving with dire physical consequences </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's really what it is.</v>

2029
01:18:57.241 --> 01:19:02.190
<v Speaker 2>But it's also done in an like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you watch Anderson fight</v>

2030
01:19:02.191 --> 01:19:03.530
<v Speaker 2>in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was beautiful.</v>

2031
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:04.583
<v Speaker 2>It was beautiful to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a statics involved that </v>

2032
01:19:07.891 --> 01:19:10.380
<v Speaker 2>were undeniably artistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

2033
01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:11.760
<v Speaker 2>there's a lesson going on</v>

2034
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.030
<v Speaker 3>fight and I can't recall it right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he mimicked all of these different</v>

2035
01:19:15.031 --> 01:19:15.864
<v Speaker 3>styles and like he did it a cup of water</v>
<v Speaker 3>move and then he did this and he was at </v>

2036
01:19:18.631 --> 01:19:21.180
<v Speaker 3>like all in one fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was monkeying around.</v>

2037
01:19:21.181 --> 01:19:22.860
<v Speaker 3>I should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean that in,</v>

2038
01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:24.690
<v Speaker 3>I guess that sounds racist and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean that.</v>

2039
01:19:24.691 --> 01:19:25.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2040
01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.980
<v Speaker 1>in the playful sentences or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>

2041
01:19:26.981 --> 01:19:27.814
<v Speaker 1>Where are we live in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say monkey and around if it's a </v>

2042
01:19:29.321 --> 01:19:30.310
<v Speaker 1>black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I,</v>

2043
01:19:30.311 --> 01:19:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean I want to respect if something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I say offend somebody,</v>

2044
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:36.840
<v Speaker 1>I want to respect their angle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>offense.</v>

2045
01:19:36.970 --> 01:19:38.350
<v Speaker 1>He didn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

2046
01:19:38.351 --> 01:19:40.360
<v Speaker 1>but I in the sense to convey in term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2047
01:19:40.361 --> 01:19:41.230
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when,</v>

2048
01:19:41.290 --> 01:19:43.360
<v Speaker 1>when he's playing around like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess when he's,</v>

2049
01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:45.250
<v Speaker 1>when he's mimicking other things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just like,</v>

2050
01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.850
<v Speaker 1>this is a fight and you're able to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>play a completely different game.</v>

2051
01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Well he was also part of his strategy</v>

2052
01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:52.083
<v Speaker 2>g and that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what sort of turned against him and </v>

2053
01:19:53.981 --> 01:19:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Chris Weidman fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2054
01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Cause that playing around sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was</v>

2055
01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.680
<v Speaker 1>walk your danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2056
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:04.320
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry I talking over you.</v>

2057
01:20:04.650 --> 01:20:05.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please go ahead.</v>

2058
01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:06.083
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Nick Diaz did it back then when he </v>

2059
01:20:07.171 --> 01:20:08.004
<v Speaker 1>laid down.</v>

2060
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:09.083
<v Speaker 5>I loved that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was one of my favorite moments in </v>

2061
01:20:10.591 --> 01:20:13.350
<v Speaker 5>any fight and it wasn't even anybody </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting hit Nicolaes down.</v>

2062
01:20:13.351 --> 01:20:14.520
<v Speaker 5>He puts his hands together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

2063
01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:17.940
<v Speaker 5>He was like Anderson to Anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He played,</v>

2064
01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:19.343
<v Speaker 5>he played,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he played the game and it was like </v>

2065
01:20:20.461 --> 01:20:21.960
<v Speaker 5>amazing nicus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Incredible.</v>

2067
01:20:25.690 --> 01:20:27.390
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't believe it's happening.</v>

2068
01:20:27.570 --> 01:20:29.460
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe this guy beating my ass.</v>

2069
01:20:29.490 --> 01:20:30.323
<v Speaker 5>And he's talking shit to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I remember when he fought Robbie </v>

2070
01:20:36.451 --> 01:20:37.284
<v Speaker 5>lawler and he was just constantly </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking shit to him while he was </v>

2071
01:20:39.391 --> 01:20:40.920
<v Speaker 5>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could see like Robbie was like,</v>

2072
01:20:40.921 --> 01:20:41.754
<v Speaker 5>what is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I give fucks with their heads in </v>

2073
01:20:44.491 --> 01:20:46.080
<v Speaker 5>people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the complete,</v>

2074
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:49.190
<v Speaker 5>that's the bench go.</v>

<v Speaker 5>like he's lying down ones.</v>

<v Speaker 5>How has,</v>

2079
01:20:58.981 --> 01:20:59.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on.</v>

2080
01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:00.693
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the funniest moments in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the history of fighting it is those are </v>

2081
01:21:03.301 --> 01:21:04.134
<v Speaker 5>the moments when you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is somebody who doesn't give a </v>

2082
01:21:06.721 --> 01:21:07.554
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well he was also trying to get Anderson </v>

2083
01:21:08.761 --> 01:21:09.594
<v Speaker 5>to engage in Anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing with Anderson was </v>

2084
01:21:11.581 --> 01:21:12.414
<v Speaker 5>counter striking [inaudible] Patrick </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] sort of expose that and a </v>

2085
01:21:14.311 --> 01:21:16.230
<v Speaker 5>lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause Patrick Otay didn't lead,</v>

2086
01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:19.080
<v Speaker 5>he just waited on Anderson and Anderson </v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

2087
01:21:19.081 --> 01:21:20.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2088
01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:21.440
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2089
01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.260
<v Speaker 3>You cause yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>counter striker is,</v>

2090
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2091
01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:26.930
<v Speaker 3>they have their own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess their own methodology with being</v>

2092
01:21:26.931 --> 01:21:29.600
<v Speaker 3>able to read what's happening and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody doesn't initiate,</v>

2093
01:21:29.601 --> 01:21:31.520
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2094
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:33.500
<v Speaker 3>And waiting is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2095
01:21:33.501 --> 01:21:34.334
<v Speaker 3>it makes the fans hate you and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>you hate yourself because you get more </v>

2096
01:21:35.991 --> 01:21:37.090
<v Speaker 3>frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying your,</v>

2097
01:21:37.190 --> 01:21:39.230
<v Speaker 3>your emotions get more intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2098
01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.353
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2099
01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.313
<v Speaker 5>especially when you get to a fight like </v>
<v Speaker 5>wonderboy thompson versus Tyron Woodley </v>

2100
01:21:44.441 --> 01:21:48.250
<v Speaker 5>where you see this waiting thing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just going on and on and on and you</v>

2101
01:21:48.251 --> 01:21:50.400
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five rounds and you're like,</v>

2102
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:52.260
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not</v>

2103
01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:53.920
<v Speaker 3>fan friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2104
01:21:53.921 --> 01:21:54.754
<v Speaker 3>But for the fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any wrong move at that point and that </v>

2105
01:21:57.431 --> 01:21:59.710
<v Speaker 3>waiting game like that could be death.</v>

2106
01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:00.880
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2107
01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:03.900
<v Speaker 5>loss loss for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

2108
01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:05.603
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what excites you now that you're not </v>

2109
01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:08.360
<v Speaker 5>fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

2110
01:22:08.370 --> 01:22:09.450
<v Speaker 5>What excites you about this</v>

2111
01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:10.950
<v Speaker 3>or oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sport.</v>

2112
01:22:10.951 --> 01:22:13.560
<v Speaker 3>It's the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a sucker for the stories.</v>

2113
01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:16.200
<v Speaker 3>The whole reason I went back to school </v>
<v Speaker 3>as I was reading some of those long from</v>

2114
01:22:16.210 --> 01:22:19.140
<v Speaker 3>essays Ama may writers were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2115
01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:20.550
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing the matchmaking,</v>

2116
01:22:20.551 --> 01:22:22.830
<v Speaker 3>it was doing okay at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing the commentary,</v>

2117
01:22:22.831 --> 01:22:23.664
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not reaching that thing that I </v>

2118
01:22:26.701 --> 01:22:27.534
<v Speaker 3>was reaching when I was fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something about me is not being </v>

2119
01:22:28.981 --> 01:22:29.970
<v Speaker 3>expressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

2120
01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:32.550
<v Speaker 3>I took a class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a writing class,</v>

2121
01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:36.090
<v Speaker 3>wrote an essay and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it got me into school and I was like,</v>

2122
01:22:36.091 --> 01:22:36.750
<v Speaker 3>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wa,</v>

2123
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:39.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like one of the best schools</v>
<v Speaker 3>for writing.</v>

2124
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:40.380
<v Speaker 3>I aware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where does two things,</v>

2125
01:22:40.381 --> 01:22:41.214
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling and writing and so you get in </v>

2126
01:22:42.271 --> 01:22:43.104
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2127
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:44.370
<v Speaker 3>Was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just so,</v>

2128
01:22:45.330 --> 01:22:46.860
<v Speaker 3>and I feel alive now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2129
01:22:46.861 --> 01:22:47.694
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm back where I'm back to being the </v>

2130
01:22:49.141 --> 01:22:49.974
<v Speaker 3>Julie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to be where I'm hungry for </v>

2131
01:22:51.211 --> 01:22:53.100
<v Speaker 3>something again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's words and stories.</v>

2132
01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:56.480
<v Speaker 3>And I think that MMA is the perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

2133
01:22:56.490 --> 01:22:58.950
<v Speaker 3>avenue for all of these stories because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2134
01:22:58.951 --> 01:22:59.784
<v Speaker 3>everybody at first in old interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would just say whatever the fuck </v>

2135
01:23:03.811 --> 01:23:05.590
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to say and they do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck they want to do.</v>

2136
01:23:05.591 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 3>And then everybody</v>

2137
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.600
<v Speaker 1>got savvy to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the media,</v>

2138
01:23:07.601 --> 01:23:08.201
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're just like,</v>

2139
01:23:08.201 --> 01:23:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm only going to reveal this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only gonna reveal this.</v>

2140
01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:11.183
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And other people played on that and </v>

2141
01:23:11.891 --> 01:23:13.150
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give more information,</v>

2142
01:23:13.151 --> 01:23:13.984
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give soundbites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that when it comes to </v>

2143
01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:18.910
<v Speaker 1>communication and words in mma and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters are giving,</v>

2144
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:20.143
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot about what's not being </v>

2145
01:23:21.221 --> 01:23:22.054
<v Speaker 1>said that can really be explored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd really like to know what that </v>

2146
01:23:24.311 --> 01:23:25.144
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what makes a fighter </v>

2147
01:23:27.711 --> 01:23:29.350
<v Speaker 1>note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes a fighter decided to fight.</v>

2148
01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:33.340
<v Speaker 1>But what makes a fighter decided to wake</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the next day after a fight?</v>

2149
01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:34.751
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2150
01:23:34.751 --> 01:23:36.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide to wake up when,</v>

2151
01:23:36.581 --> 01:23:37.301
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2152
01:23:37.301 --> 01:23:39.070
<v Speaker 1>it's so emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>

2153
01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:42.940
<v Speaker 1>And fighters are such insane people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>after a loss,</v>

2154
01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:43.803
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised actually there aren't more</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicides and stuff like that in this </v>

2155
01:23:45.871 --> 01:23:46.150
<v Speaker 1>sport.</v>

2156
01:23:46.150 --> 01:23:47.140
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean to get more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2157
01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.073
<v Speaker 1>super serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people's take it to such a high </v>

2158
01:23:49.181 --> 01:23:52.180
<v Speaker 1>level and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with the amount of,</v>

2159
01:23:52.181 --> 01:23:55.150
<v Speaker 1>of pain that they invest in themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the amount of emotion towards it,</v>

2160
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:58.240
<v Speaker 1>when fighters decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost this fight and I lost this fight,</v>

2161
01:23:58.241 --> 01:24:00.070
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to get back in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it again.</v>

2162
01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Like if they decide they make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious choice to stay,</v>

2163
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:07.210
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's living in the sense</v>

2164
01:24:07.211 --> 01:24:08.044
<v Speaker 1>of biologically living or just living in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that space still of wanting to be a </v>

2165
01:24:10.451 --> 01:24:11.860
<v Speaker 1>fighter of wanting to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>

2166
01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:12.850
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all I know.</v>

2167
01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:14.740
<v Speaker 1>All I know I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I've ever known is fighting.</v>

2168
01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.200
<v Speaker 1>So when the fighting is over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

2169
01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:18.153
<v Speaker 1>What do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was just talking to him favor </v>

2170
01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:21.403
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that he's a real good role </v>

2171
01:24:22.991 --> 01:24:23.824
<v Speaker 1>model to young fighters cause he's as </v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic as about his post fight </v>

2172
01:24:28.211 --> 01:24:29.044
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

2173
01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:29.831
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>excited.</v>

2175
01:24:32.050 --> 01:24:34.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to do different things now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went out with a win,</v>

2176
01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:37.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I love the fact that he did that.</v>

2177
01:24:37.121 --> 01:24:37.954
<v Speaker 1>He fought in Sacramento in his hometown </v>
<v Speaker 1>and gets a tough guy and Brad Pickett </v>

2178
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:42.183
<v Speaker 1>beats brad and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go out with a win and I'm </v>

01:24:46.691 --> 01:24:49.570
<v Speaker 1>And he gets his giant round of applause </v>
<v Speaker 1>and good for him.</v>

2181
01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came from a place of,</v>

2182
01:24:50.941 --> 01:24:52.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess of,</v>

2183
01:24:53.290 --> 01:24:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh I think privilege is the wrong word </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he built what he built.</v>

2184
01:24:57.150 --> 01:24:57.983
<v Speaker 1>It does not privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe he came from a place of being </v>

2185
01:24:59.321 --> 01:25:02.230
<v Speaker 1>able to see a bigger picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you think about lane,</v>

2186
01:25:02.231 --> 01:25:03.064
<v Speaker 1>be the Joe Frazier's of the sport or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that when they stopped </v>

2187
01:25:05.021 --> 01:25:05.470
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

2188
01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:06.540
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2189
01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:08.200
<v Speaker 1>he built a gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did this,</v>

2190
01:25:08.201 --> 01:25:09.370
<v Speaker 1>he did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like what,</v>

2191
01:25:09.970 --> 01:25:12.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter stories to me are incredible.</v>

2192
01:25:12.671 --> 01:25:15.400
<v Speaker 1>The reasons that people fight and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons that commentators commentate,</v>

2193
01:25:15.401 --> 01:25:16.234
<v Speaker 1>the reasons that people are still so </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally invested in this sport and </v>

2194
01:25:19.391 --> 01:25:21.670
<v Speaker 1>what those stories are and what keeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>people going.</v>

2195
01:25:21.970 --> 01:25:22.803
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's something to the </v>

2196
01:25:24.581 --> 01:25:29.320
<v Speaker 1>creation we have built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the fertittas and Dana built like</v>

2197
01:25:29.321 --> 01:25:31.360
<v Speaker 1>the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean we as fighters,</v>

2198
01:25:31.361 --> 01:25:32.194
<v Speaker 1>as a fighter community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as mma community have built something </v>

2199
01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:38.761
<v Speaker 1>incredible and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I am interested in why we still want</v>

2200
01:25:38.891 --> 01:25:41.140
<v Speaker 1>to occupy this space or what makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to leave it,</v>

2201
01:25:41.141 --> 01:25:41.974
<v Speaker 1>but then come back and maybe that's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>my own personal journey because I can't </v>

2202
01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.180
<v Speaker 1>get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

2203
01:25:46.210 --> 01:25:47.043
<v Speaker 1>I can't quit mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has been the greatest love of 10 I </v>

2204
01:25:51.831 --> 01:25:53.860
<v Speaker 1>mean the life going down to level four.</v>

2205
01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:54.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2206
01:25:54.881 --> 01:25:57.070
<v Speaker 1>you can't mimic the intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

2207
01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:59.560
<v Speaker 1>and I'm finding in words and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in communication,</v>

2208
01:25:59.561 --> 01:26:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm finding something there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm finding that I can,</v>

2209
01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:02.950
<v Speaker 1>I can access this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2210
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:05.660
<v Speaker 1>it's harder for me because I have to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brain work,</v>

2211
01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.650
<v Speaker 1>but I can't just go in there kicking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>punching.</v>

2212
01:26:08.670 --> 01:26:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Like I have to like sit and think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2213
01:26:10.191 --> 01:26:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I have to formulate these questions for </v>
<v Speaker 1>life that I've never even thought about.</v>

2214
01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.240
<v Speaker 1>But you got to love the questions like </v>
<v Speaker 1>real case side,</v>

2215
01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:17.120
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The questions are what's important,</v>

2216
01:26:17.121 --> 01:26:19.760
<v Speaker 1>not even the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just finding the right questions to</v>

2217
01:26:19.761 --> 01:26:21.080
<v Speaker 1>ask him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going through that.</v>

2218
01:26:21.081 --> 01:26:26.081
<v Speaker 1>And I've really rediscovered a love for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sport by stepping away from it.</v>

2219
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every commentary job that I do now,</v>

2220
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:30.530
<v Speaker 1>every time I'm in there for Invicta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

2221
01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:31.880
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing.</v>

2222
01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:34.210
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finding that enthusiasm and again,</v>

2223
01:26:34.211 --> 01:26:35.420
<v Speaker 1>as is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

2224
01:26:35.421 --> 01:26:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have that towards the end of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight career.</v>

2225
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:39.560
<v Speaker 1>I was in the UFC because that was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream.</v>

2226
01:26:39.561 --> 01:26:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I had to be in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does an Invicta,</v>

2227
01:26:41.421 --> 01:26:43.160
<v Speaker 1>how ring card boys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2228
01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Shannon thinks that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespectful to boys.</v>

2229
01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:47.113
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that she makes it more of a </v>

2230
01:26:47.541 --> 01:26:48.374
<v Speaker 1>spectacle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So plus these are employees and I think </v>

2231
01:26:50.721 --> 01:26:51.554
<v Speaker 1>it's a spectacle for girls too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have my own opinions about all of </v>

2232
01:26:52.911 --> 01:26:53.744
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the male gaze and mma and stuff </v>

2233
01:26:54.531 --> 01:26:56.000
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the male gaze,</v>

2234
01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:57.340
<v Speaker 1>the male gaze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2235
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Well it's just eats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we are formulated to see things,</v>

2236
01:26:59.901 --> 01:27:00.734
<v Speaker 1>I mean ring card girls or tradition that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have come over from boxing and stuff </v>

2237
01:27:02.631 --> 01:27:04.280
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's never been questioned.</v>

2238
01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:05.211
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2239
01:27:05.211 --> 01:27:05.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2240
01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:06.620
<v Speaker 1>why do we still have this?</v>

2241
01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:10.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean we can put up the ring number </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine a a jumbo tron.</v>

2242
01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:11.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And same time,</v>

2243
01:27:11.181 --> 01:27:12.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't want these women to lose their </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>

2244
01:27:12.681 --> 01:27:13.514
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're part of the brand and the </v>

2245
01:27:14.751 --> 01:27:16.930
<v Speaker 1>promotional aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the marine corps,</v>

2246
01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:17.764
<v Speaker 1>girls for Invicta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call them the phoenix girls and </v>

2247
01:27:19.521 --> 01:27:20.354
<v Speaker 1>they're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean an Natasha Kingsbury's like a </v>

2248
01:27:21.261 --> 01:27:22.130
<v Speaker 1>professional runner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2249
01:27:22.131 --> 01:27:23.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're serious high level like there,</v>

2250
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:25.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she used to be ring card girl for the,</v>

2251
01:27:26.210 --> 01:27:29.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's so great and she's very yoga mind.</v>

2252
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:31.880
<v Speaker 1>He's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's really cool.</v>

2253
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2254
01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:34.011
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

2255
01:27:34.011 --> 01:27:39.011
<v Speaker 1>I think that Shannon doesn't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that spectacle illness,</v>

2256
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:40.843
<v Speaker 1>although I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that the ring girls are </v>

2257
01:27:41.991 --> 01:27:44.810
<v Speaker 1>spectacle in in that self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

2258
01:27:44.811 --> 01:27:46.310
<v Speaker 1>I really liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked them.</v>

2259
01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Like the girls that worked for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the women who worked for us.</v>

2260
01:27:48.341 --> 01:27:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2261
01:27:48.610 --> 01:27:49.443
<v Speaker 2>really odd isn't it that there's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>female ring card girls and an all </v>

2262
01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:53.434
<v Speaker 2>female?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what if we had ring card boys in </v>

2263
01:27:55.751 --> 01:27:56.584
<v Speaker 2>the UFC for all the men fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who'd be really weird if guys are </v>

2264
01:27:59.201 --> 01:28:01.570
<v Speaker 2>walking around with Speedos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with high top</v>

2265
01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.593
<v Speaker 1>box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we think about seeing that for the </v>

2266
01:28:05.151 --> 01:28:05.984
<v Speaker 1>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can visually picture that right now </v>

2267
01:28:06.891 --> 01:28:08.090
<v Speaker 1>because we're not used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2268
01:28:08.091 --> 01:28:08.924
<v Speaker 1>it would be weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean if it was the norm then I </v>

2269
01:28:10.281 --> 01:28:13.640
<v Speaker 1>don't think it would be that weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think and bodybuilder dudes,</v>

2270
01:28:13.641 --> 01:28:14.474
<v Speaker 1>you remember King of the cage when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had that guy who was the king of the </v>

2271
01:28:16.331 --> 01:28:19.790
<v Speaker 1>cage who was just gigantic it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilder.</v>

2272
01:28:19.890 --> 01:28:20.723
<v Speaker 1>Dude wasn't even fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was the king of the king of the </v>

2273
01:28:23.091 --> 01:28:24.380
<v Speaker 1>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't make any sense.</v>

2274
01:28:24.381 --> 01:28:25.700
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is happening here?</v>

2275
01:28:25.701 --> 01:28:26.534
<v Speaker 1>What is this supposed to represent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of goes back to branding and </v>

2276
01:28:28.671 --> 01:28:31.580
<v Speaker 1>like the weird ways we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how are we present ourselves to the</v>

2277
01:28:31.581 --> 01:28:32.960
<v Speaker 1>world or what we're trying to say.</v>

2278
01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2279
01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:35.473
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the ring card girl thing is an odd </v>

2280
01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:39.380
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2281
01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:42.710
<v Speaker 2>and it's weird when you have an all </v>
<v Speaker 2>female organization,</v>

2282
01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:43.933
<v Speaker 2>all female fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet you still have girls holding up </v>

2283
01:28:47.901 --> 01:28:48.734
<v Speaker 2>the cards</v>

2284
01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:51.240
<v Speaker 1>should go with dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll,</v>

2285
01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:52.083
<v Speaker 1>I'll bring that up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure Shannon wouldn't be </v>

2286
01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:57.260
<v Speaker 1>unborn sage northcutt looking young </v>
<v Speaker 1>fellows tram.</v>

2287
01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:58.840
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is though,</v>

2288
01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.700
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think about it though,</v>

2289
01:29:00.701 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 1>we think combat has been</v>

2290
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:06.360
<v Speaker 3>so sexualized and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be out of the norm.</v>

2291
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:08.790
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>

2292
01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:10.800
<v Speaker 3>what are you even talking about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We laugh,</v>

2293
01:29:10.801 --> 01:29:11.634
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause it shocks our sensibilities a </v>

2294
01:29:12.391 --> 01:29:13.500
<v Speaker 3>little something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not used to that.</v>

2295
01:29:13.501 --> 01:29:14.520
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

2296
01:29:14.910 --> 01:29:15.451
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2297
01:29:15.451 --> 01:29:17.790
<v Speaker 3>what did you think about females when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they first started fighting him?</v>

2298
01:29:17.791 --> 01:29:19.320
<v Speaker 3>A man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you think about female fighting?</v>

2299
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:20.060
<v Speaker 3>Like?</v>

2300
01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:20.893
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a chance to watch tough enough in </v>

2301
01:29:22.671 --> 01:29:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't remember the event,</v>

2302
01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:25.693
<v Speaker 2>but nick the goat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thompson was on the card and there was </v>

2303
01:29:27.621 --> 01:29:28.340
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2304
01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:29.173
<v Speaker 2>undercard fight between these two women </v>
<v Speaker 2>and these gals went to war and we were </v>

2305
01:29:34.071 --> 01:29:34.904
<v Speaker 2>in the front row and it was just chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could remember who was </v>

2306
01:29:38.091 --> 01:29:38.924
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was such a wild and crazy fight </v>

2307
01:29:41.150 --> 01:29:41.983
<v Speaker 2>that at the end of the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone in the arena was his standing </v>

2308
01:29:44.631 --> 01:29:46.730
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming and cheering and clapping.</v>

2309
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:49.040
<v Speaker 2>And I was with Eddie Bravo and we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>both like,</v>

2310
01:29:49.041 --> 01:29:50.630
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan of women fighting now.</v>

2311
01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:51.180
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

2312
01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:52.080
<v Speaker 3>And what did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not before,</v>

2313
01:29:52.081 --> 01:29:55.620
<v Speaker 3>like what was that just you had to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>them actually in action doing,</v>

2314
01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.810
<v Speaker 3>I guess being on that level or did you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2315
01:29:57.811 --> 01:30:00.000
<v Speaker 3>it just wasn't on your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on your radar before that</v>

2316
01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:03.580
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't enough of it to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>compare what you had to see it,</v>

2317
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:05.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>

2318
01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:07.840
<v Speaker 2>it has to be presented to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm obviously a huge fan of it,</v>

2319
01:30:07.841 --> 01:30:10.520
<v Speaker 2>but you have to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we really,</v>

2320
01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:13.240
<v Speaker 2>we weren't really exposed to it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't in the UFC.</v>

2321
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:15.340
<v Speaker 2>So you'd have to go out and seek it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

2322
01:30:15.341 --> 01:30:16.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pre strike force.</v>

2323
01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:19.960
<v Speaker 2>So it just wasn't something that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

2324
01:30:20.230 --> 01:30:22.780
<v Speaker 2>were aware of and it wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2325
01:30:22.781 --> 01:30:23.614
<v Speaker 2>when you first started fighting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about trying to get a </v>

2326
01:30:24.911 --> 01:30:26.380
<v Speaker 2>fight just wasn't that prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2327
01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:26.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2328
01:30:26.891 --> 01:30:30.130
<v Speaker 3>I think that it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean women didn't even know they could</v>

2329
01:30:30.131 --> 01:30:30.690
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2330
01:30:30.690 --> 01:30:32.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and at a certain time.</v>

2331
01:30:32.111 --> 01:30:32.944
<v Speaker 3>So it's like shifting the attention to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that when you can actually watch these </v>

2332
01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.570
<v Speaker 3>dudes who are fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2333
01:30:37.571 --> 01:30:39.070
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to think of that on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>radar.</v>

2334
01:30:39.071 --> 01:30:41.200
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to seek that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're actually seeing fights,</v>

2335
01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:43.690
<v Speaker 3>unless it's given to your list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>presented to you,</v>

2336
01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:45.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then why,</v>

2337
01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:47.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would it be on the radar?</v>

2338
01:30:47.530 --> 01:30:48.363
<v Speaker 3>Just think of it.</v>

2339
01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:49.253
<v Speaker 2>Women finding was also in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to a certain sense of </v>

2340
01:30:51.901 --> 01:30:54.960
<v Speaker 2>frustration for the athletes that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>

2341
01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Like Lucy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a riker could never get Christy Martin a</v>

2342
01:30:58.831 --> 01:30:59.670
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2343
01:30:59.671 --> 01:31:00.504
<v Speaker 2>there was always that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd always known lucy a Ryko was </v>

2344
01:31:02.491 --> 01:31:05.070
<v Speaker 2>like the best women boxer and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of knew,</v>

2345
01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.113
<v Speaker 2>but she couldn't get that fight like </v>
<v Speaker 2>where everybody would know how good she </v>

2346
01:31:09.901 --> 01:31:11.340
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then everybody's like,</v>

2347
01:31:11.341 --> 01:31:13.290
<v Speaker 2>oh Cristina Martins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best female box.</v>

2348
01:31:13.291 --> 01:31:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm like God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2349
01:31:14.131 --> 01:31:14.964
<v Speaker 2>she's not like you got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got to fight this woman from </v>

2350
01:31:17.341 --> 01:31:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2351
01:31:18.451 --> 01:31:19.284
<v Speaker 2>And then to sort of never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you know there was mia st John </v>

2352
01:31:21.781 --> 01:31:22.614
<v Speaker 2>who was more like a girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good boxer and she was cute and she </v>

2353
01:31:25.771 --> 01:31:29.280
<v Speaker 2>was really working that angle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's Laila Ali of course who</v>

2354
01:31:29.281 --> 01:31:32.670
<v Speaker 2>was Muhammad Ali's daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was no one who caught fire.</v>

2355
01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:34.290
<v Speaker 2>There was no one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no like,</v>

2356
01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:36.540
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this girl is going to fight this fight.</v>

2357
01:31:36.541 --> 01:31:38.340
<v Speaker 2>This is going to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what we have now,</v>

2358
01:31:38.490 --> 01:31:40.920
<v Speaker 2>like what we have now in MMA is </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly unique.</v>

2359
01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:42.023
<v Speaker 2>You know like Valentina Shevchenko and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amanda Nunez did is just to super high </v>

2360
01:31:47.011 --> 01:31:47.844
<v Speaker 2>level MMA fighters who happened to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>women who have worked their way up the </v>

2361
01:31:51.421 --> 01:31:53.880
<v Speaker 2>ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amanda Nunez is obviously the champion.</v>

2362
01:31:53.881 --> 01:31:57.090
<v Speaker 2>Valentina though is just knocking on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking door.</v>

2363
01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.193
<v Speaker 2>And that is an exciting dynamic matchup </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the women's bantamweight title that </v>

2364
01:32:01.721 --> 01:32:03.070
<v Speaker 2>didn't exist in boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2365
01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:05.620
<v Speaker 2>There was never that sort of match up </v>
<v Speaker 2>buildup thing.</v>

2366
01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:06.693
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other people waiting pass </v>

2367
01:32:09.251 --> 01:32:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Valentino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there's,</v>

2368
01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:12.400
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's contenders,</v>

2369
01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:15.880
<v Speaker 2>it's real and there's contenders at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Straw weight as well.</v>

2370
01:32:15.881 --> 01:32:16.714
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that there was always </v>

2371
01:32:19.541 --> 01:32:22.780
<v Speaker 2>this sort of thing there was connected </v>
<v Speaker 2>with women fighting like that.</v>

2372
01:32:22.781 --> 01:32:23.614
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't legit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was kind of like the w nba isn't </v>

2373
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:26.703
<v Speaker 2>as good as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an athlete as some of those players </v>

2374
01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:31.690
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one gives a fuck in this country.</v>

2375
01:32:31.691 --> 01:32:33.100
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't catch on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2376
01:32:33.101 --> 01:32:34.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they give a fuck in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably mad at that.</v>

2377
01:32:34.691 --> 01:32:35.524
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

2378
01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:40.570
<v Speaker 3>you mean marketing wise for some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason it wasn't seen as a,</v>

2379
01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:42.810
<v Speaker 3>it's not seen as an equal sphere to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>NBA.</v>

2380
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:43.703
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's been unique about female </v>

2381
01:32:46.590 --> 01:32:51.590
<v Speaker 3>fighters in MMA is that because they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>share the same octagon on the same night</v>

2382
01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:53.340
<v Speaker 3>because they're in the same playing </v>
<v Speaker 3>field.</v>

2383
01:32:53.370 --> 01:32:57.030
<v Speaker 3>Then there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a chance to see more of an equal</v>

2384
01:32:57.031 --> 01:32:57.480
<v Speaker 3>setting.</v>

2385
01:32:57.480 --> 01:32:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100% yeah.</v>

2386
01:32:58.771 --> 01:33:00.600
<v Speaker 2>I think that's hugely important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2387
01:33:00.601 --> 01:33:03.300
<v Speaker 2>when you have someone like Rhonda Rousey</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's headlining,</v>

2388
01:33:03.330 --> 01:33:06.300
<v Speaker 2>I am massive card and the paper view </v>
<v Speaker 2>sells 1.5</v>

2389
01:33:06.301 --> 01:33:07.134
<v Speaker 2>million buys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is gigantic for women's combat </v>

2390
01:33:09.931 --> 01:33:10.764
<v Speaker 2>sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for combat sports in general and it's </v>

2391
01:33:12.241 --> 01:33:14.310
<v Speaker 2>unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who says it's not,</v>

2392
01:33:14.311 --> 01:33:15.330
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>

2393
01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:16.553
<v Speaker 2>Before Ronda Rousey came along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there had never been an athlete like </v>

2394
01:33:18.631 --> 01:33:19.464
<v Speaker 2>that that had been dominating in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>combat sport in on a worldwide scale </v>

2395
01:33:24.031 --> 01:33:26.490
<v Speaker 2>where everybody knew who she was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's totally uncharted.</v>

2396
01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:27.360
<v Speaker 3>Terry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was,</v>

2397
01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:31.830
<v Speaker 3>she was the mainstream appeal of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow with what she presented.</v>

2398
01:33:31.831 --> 01:33:32.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's an incredible person,</v>

2399
01:33:32.881 --> 01:33:34.830
<v Speaker 3>but for with what she presented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

2400
01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:38.570
<v Speaker 3>she had the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the package that that transcended over.</v>

2401
01:33:38.571 --> 01:33:39.404
<v Speaker 3>This is a female fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was Ronda Rousey as a fighter and of </v>

2402
01:33:41.251 --> 01:33:43.860
<v Speaker 3>course they focused on her femininity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They focused on her being a female,</v>

2403
01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:46.620
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she was doing way better than the</v>

2404
01:33:46.621 --> 01:33:48.930
<v Speaker 3>men when it came to universal appeal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

2405
01:33:48.931 --> 01:33:50.430
<v Speaker 3>Like there was something that she </v>
<v Speaker 3>crossed,</v>

2406
01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:51.960
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was a unique thing</v>

2407
01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:53.770
<v Speaker 2>is this unique thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2408
01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:56.350
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that just did not </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>

2409
01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:57.213
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gina Carano sorta caught it a little </v>

2410
01:33:58.781 --> 01:34:02.410
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was gone before it really caught</v>

2411
01:34:02.411 --> 01:34:03.400
<v Speaker 2>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2412
01:34:03.401 --> 01:34:06.310
<v Speaker 2>And then when she lost a Cyborg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

2413
01:34:06.690 --> 01:34:07.523
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of like weird feelings </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that because there's all these </v>

2414
01:34:10.481 --> 01:34:11.314
<v Speaker 2>speculations as Cyborg was on drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they looked at Gina Carano and she </v>

2415
01:34:14.621 --> 01:34:15.454
<v Speaker 2>was all beat up afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that left is sort of weird taste in </v>

2416
01:34:18.281 --> 01:34:18.940
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2417
01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:21.190
<v Speaker 3>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that,</v>

2418
01:34:21.250 --> 01:34:24.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>around their eyes are tasty.</v>

2419
01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:24.851
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2420
01:34:24.851 --> 01:34:27.070
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2421
01:34:27.071 --> 01:34:29.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unfortunate because I'm like,</v>

2422
01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.290
<v Speaker 3>I know Chris Cyborg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2423
01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I was the matchmaker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2424
01:34:33.050 --> 01:34:34.720
<v Speaker 3>within victim when she was fighting for </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

2425
01:34:34.721 --> 01:34:35.554
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was there for her weight cuts and I </v>

2426
01:34:36.791 --> 01:34:38.500
<v Speaker 3>saw some of her struggles and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what,</v>

2427
01:34:38.501 --> 01:34:39.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind,</v>

2428
01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:41.950
<v Speaker 3>kind person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she is just a genuinely kind person.</v>

2429
01:34:42.130 --> 01:34:42.963
<v Speaker 3>But then there's this persona of </v>
<v Speaker 3>toughness and her saying this kind of </v>

2430
01:34:44.831 --> 01:34:45.664
<v Speaker 3>thing to Rondo or she's saying this to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gina and then they're sending it back </v>

2431
01:34:47.411 --> 01:34:48.460
<v Speaker 3>and it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2432
01:34:48.461 --> 01:34:50.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it just like for some reason,</v>

2433
01:34:50.021 --> 01:34:51.790
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never thought she got the,</v>

2434
01:34:51.791 --> 01:34:53.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the respect that was due,</v>

2435
01:34:53.861 --> 01:34:55.900
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then she did fail a drug test.</v>

2436
01:34:55.901 --> 01:34:56.980
<v Speaker 3>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2437
01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:57.853
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

2438
01:34:58.130 --> 01:34:58.963
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately you carry the burden of </v>
<v Speaker 1>having your entire legacy be questioned </v>

2439
01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:03.740
<v Speaker 1>when you mess up like that.</v>

2440
01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:06.310
<v Speaker 2>But we know what the human body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like,</v>

2441
01:35:06.730 --> 01:35:07.563
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what a female body looks like </v>

2442
01:35:09.011 --> 01:35:09.844
<v Speaker 2>and you know what someone looks like </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they most likely have been </v>

2443
01:35:12.881 --> 01:35:15.370
<v Speaker 2>introducing male hormones into a female </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

2444
01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:17.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2445
01:35:17.111 --> 01:35:17.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2446
01:35:17.681 --> 01:35:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you're saying because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know what we think is normal or what,</v>

2447
01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:22.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a female body is like.</v>

2448
01:35:22.811 --> 01:35:24.190
<v Speaker 1>But I would say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2449
01:35:25.090 --> 01:35:27.460
<v Speaker 1>we know what a male body looks like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2450
01:35:27.461 --> 01:35:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Without hormones and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2451
01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:29.793
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at somebody who's like perfect </v>

2452
01:35:30.611 --> 01:35:31.960
<v Speaker 1>physique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sage northcutt.</v>

2453
01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is everybody's speculating </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2454
01:35:34.061 --> 01:35:35.920
<v Speaker 1>he's on steroids because he looks a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain way.</v>

2455
01:35:35.950 --> 01:35:36.783
<v Speaker 1>Cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met the kid when he was a kid and he </v>

2456
01:35:38.861 --> 01:35:39.510
<v Speaker 1>looked like that.</v>

2457
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:42.510
<v Speaker 2>The problem that line of thinking is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's a male.</v>

2458
01:35:42.690 --> 01:35:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he has natural testosterone and</v>

2459
01:35:44.881 --> 01:35:47.610
<v Speaker 2>then you can accentuate natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone pretty significantly,</v>

2460
01:35:47.611 --> 01:35:50.100
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're someone like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin randleman.</v>

2461
01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>

2462
01:35:51.090 --> 01:35:51.923
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Marvin Eastman who just has this </v>

2463
01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:54.473
<v Speaker 2>extreme mesomorphic bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that are built </v>

2464
01:35:56.911 --> 01:36:00.930
<v Speaker 2>that way that don't do anything illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of women that are,</v>

2465
01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:02.201
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2466
01:36:02.201 --> 01:36:02.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2467
01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:05.320
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we do the eye test like that,</v>

2468
01:36:05.321 --> 01:36:07.390
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely understand that my,</v>

2469
01:36:07.391 --> 01:36:11.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I wanted to believe of course,</v>

2470
01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:13.450
<v Speaker 1>that I wanted to believe that Cyborg was</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug free.</v>

2471
01:36:13.451 --> 01:36:15.880
<v Speaker 1>And now I believe that she is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that she's not currently,</v>

2472
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:16.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that she's,</v>

2473
01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:20.170
<v Speaker 1>whatever happened in that time in 2011 </v>
<v Speaker 1>she has rectified it.</v>

2474
01:36:20.171 --> 01:36:22.630
<v Speaker 1>She's passed all of her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess something happened.</v>

2475
01:36:22.730 --> 01:36:25.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really because it was with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC with some kind of task,</v>

2476
01:36:25.421 --> 01:36:27.910
<v Speaker 1>but it turned out it was with her birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>control pills or something.</v>

2477
01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:29.710
<v Speaker 1>What kind of behind him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2478
01:36:29.730 --> 01:36:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Something happened with her birth can or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2479
01:36:31.690 --> 01:36:33.070
<v Speaker 1>something happened there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

2480
01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:34.940
<v Speaker 2>notes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spironolactone,</v>

2481
01:36:34.941 --> 01:36:35.774
<v Speaker 2>spironolactone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a dht inhibitor with </v>

2482
01:36:38.091 --> 01:36:41.570
<v Speaker 2>dihydrotestosterone inhibitor that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>used for a bunch of different reasons.</v>

2483
01:36:41.571 --> 01:36:43.080
<v Speaker 2>It's used as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2484
01:36:43.730 --> 01:36:44.563
<v Speaker 2>it's used as a diuretic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's used for people combating the </v>

2485
01:36:47.721 --> 01:36:51.560
<v Speaker 2>effects of anabolic steroids for females</v>
<v Speaker 2>combating the effect.</v>

2486
01:36:51.561 --> 01:36:52.394
<v Speaker 2>It's used for cysts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's used for a bunch of different </v>

2487
01:36:55.701 --> 01:36:57.560
<v Speaker 2>possible reasons to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2488
01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2489
01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:59.113
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I think I've known someone who's </v>

2490
01:37:00.141 --> 01:37:02.570
<v Speaker 1>been on that for cystic acne before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I understand.</v>

2491
01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:05.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what happened in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

2492
01:37:05.181 --> 01:37:07.580
<v Speaker 1>And I would love to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to read about it.</v>

2493
01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to know more about it.</v>

2494
01:37:08.721 --> 01:37:11.270
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my sphere of interest.</v>

2495
01:37:11.271 --> 01:37:11.761
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2496
01:37:11.761 --> 01:37:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2497
01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:14.540
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pre 2011 drug test,</v>

2498
01:37:14.541 --> 01:37:15.374
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to believe she was natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I wanted to believe in her and </v>

2499
01:37:17.181 --> 01:37:22.181
<v Speaker 1>believe that somebody could be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>vicious and ferocious and wonderful like</v>

2500
01:37:23.091 --> 01:37:23.924
<v Speaker 1>that and take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the idea of women fighting to a </v>

2501
01:37:26.901 --> 01:37:29.830
<v Speaker 1>different level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when she tested positive for,</v>

2502
01:37:29.850 --> 01:37:30.880
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2503
01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:35.920
<v Speaker 1>it was a d stands yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stands something in $2,011</v>

2504
01:37:36.730 --> 01:37:37.880
<v Speaker 1>a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2505
01:37:37.881 --> 01:37:38.511
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2506
01:37:38.511 --> 01:37:41.180
<v Speaker 1>and then I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was heartbroken because first of all,</v>

2507
01:37:41.181 --> 01:37:41.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just like,</v>

2508
01:37:41.901 --> 01:37:43.910
<v Speaker 1>there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't believe anymore.</v>

2509
01:37:43.911 --> 01:37:44.744
<v Speaker 1>And then I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to meet her actually in </v>

2510
01:37:45.710 --> 01:37:48.020
<v Speaker 1>professional setting and I got to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>her as a person.</v>

2511
01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:49.700
<v Speaker 1>And you realize that when you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2512
01:37:49.701 --> 01:37:52.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot more new on student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in you as a person and not,</v>

2513
01:37:52.281 --> 01:37:53.150
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2514
01:37:53.151 --> 01:37:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Like I believed in a lot of guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be taken steroids.</v>

2515
01:37:55.711 --> 01:37:56.544
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

2516
01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:58.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird to associate,</v>

2517
01:37:58.021 --> 01:37:59.950
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

2518
01:38:00.010 --> 01:38:02.680
<v Speaker 2>well you're a nice person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're kind what you wish for the best.</v>

2519
01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:03.853
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also wish for the best for women </v>

2520
01:38:05.061 --> 01:38:07.670
<v Speaker 1>all the time and that we're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>mess up,</v>

2521
01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:10.460
<v Speaker 2>but if everybody's got a message for </v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

2522
01:38:10.461 --> 01:38:11.294
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you definitely want to take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard stance against someone who's </v>

2523
01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:17.100
<v Speaker 2>introducing male hormones into a female </v>
<v Speaker 2>body and that you know,</v>

2524
01:38:17.110 --> 01:38:17.943
<v Speaker 2>they'll also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem that is lot of the effects </v>

2525
01:38:19.641 --> 01:38:20.840
<v Speaker 2>are permanent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

2526
01:38:20.841 --> 01:38:25.070
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the effects of a woman altering</v>
<v Speaker 2>her physiology with male hormones.</v>

2527
01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:25.933
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain amount of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects and this is also argued against </v>

2528
01:38:28.221 --> 01:38:29.054
<v Speaker 2>men taking steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain amount and there's </v>

2529
01:38:30.711 --> 01:38:33.980
<v Speaker 2>been tests about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't just speculation that certain</v>

2530
01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:37.220
<v Speaker 2>amount of physiological changes are </v>
<v Speaker 2>permanent.</v>

2531
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:38.263
<v Speaker 2>When you take steroids because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>introducing these hyper human levels of </v>

2532
01:38:42.171 --> 01:38:45.350
<v Speaker 2>testosterone to a mail system and things</v>
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>

2533
01:38:45.351 --> 01:38:47.930
<v Speaker 2>bone density changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shape of your body changes,</v>

2534
01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:49.610
<v Speaker 2>the did tendon strength changes,</v>

2535
01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:50.593
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your testicles shrink and certainly </v>

2536
01:38:51.861 --> 01:38:53.390
<v Speaker 1>cause you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the ability to like,</v>

2537
01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:56.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that comes back like the,</v>

2538
01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:57.793
<v Speaker 2>the testicular atrophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's really the shutdown of </v>

2539
01:39:00.211 --> 01:39:01.044
<v Speaker 2>the endocrine system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that comes back and when it comes </v>

2540
01:39:02.971 --> 01:39:03.804
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain amount of the </v>

2541
01:39:04.651 --> 01:39:05.484
<v Speaker 2>improvements that you've received </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the steroids that you will </v>

2542
01:39:07.321 --> 01:39:08.154
<v Speaker 2>keep forever.</v>

2543
01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:11.430
<v Speaker 1>So even when you're in that exact post </v>
<v Speaker 1>steroid area.</v>

2544
01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2545
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:14.300
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>infuriates people that have been cleaned</v>

2546
01:39:14.301 --> 01:39:15.134
<v Speaker 2>their whole life is that someone can </v>
<v Speaker 2>test positive and then they continue on </v>

2547
01:39:19.041 --> 01:39:19.874
<v Speaker 2>their career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if they're not taking steroids now </v>

2548
01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:23.390
<v Speaker 2>they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a benefit.</v>

2549
01:39:23.450 --> 01:39:26.600
<v Speaker 2>They have a permanent benefit of taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>those illegal drugs.</v>

2550
01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:29.030
<v Speaker 1>That sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2551
01:39:29.250 --> 01:39:30.083
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's nothing I can say like </v>

2552
01:39:31.341 --> 01:39:33.320
<v Speaker 1>that would champion that being a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2553
01:39:33.321 --> 01:39:35.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I will say that like,</v>

2554
01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:39.020
<v Speaker 1>she did not test positive the entire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2555
01:39:39.021 --> 01:39:43.040
<v Speaker 1>since 2011 and so if there was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage in something like that,</v>

2556
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.903
<v Speaker 1>we saw somebody like you bearish and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing still work against that and </v>

2557
01:39:47.601 --> 01:39:49.730
<v Speaker 1>still find victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

2558
01:39:50.690 --> 01:39:51.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know</v>

2559
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:53.340
<v Speaker 2>when should someone have to work against</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

2560
01:39:53.341 --> 01:39:54.174
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's Eurena barge fight was a </v>

2561
01:39:55.021 --> 01:39:56.840
<v Speaker 2>testament to cyborgs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Courage.</v>

2562
01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:00.570
<v Speaker 2>And and fighting spirit that she took </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fight because nobody wanted a fight</v>

2563
01:40:00.571 --> 01:40:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Joanna for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't know who Julian a barge</v>

2564
01:40:03.751 --> 01:40:05.370
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you watch her Moitai fight,</v>

2565
01:40:05.371 --> 01:40:08.670
<v Speaker 2>she's some ungodly number of fights </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's had.</v>

2566
01:40:08.671 --> 01:40:09.504
<v Speaker 2>She's a multiple time world champion and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's just so stunningly technical as a </v>

2567
01:40:13.351 --> 01:40:14.790
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2568
01:40:14.791 --> 01:40:17.310
<v Speaker 2>you look at them physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look very,</v>

2569
01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:18.540
<v Speaker 2>very different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2570
01:40:18.570 --> 01:40:19.403
<v Speaker 2>beside Borg is just this attacker </v>
<v Speaker 2>berserker style and fought a very good </v>

2571
01:40:22.771 --> 01:40:25.350
<v Speaker 2>fight against girl that nobody wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2572
01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:27.510
<v Speaker 2>It was a wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastic fight.</v>

2573
01:40:27.630 --> 01:40:30.950
<v Speaker 1>One of those fights even in in a loss </v>
<v Speaker 1>like her stock came out.</v>

2574
01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:32.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cyborg things.</v>

2575
01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:33.970
<v Speaker 2>I hate her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look I,</v>

2576
01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:34.863
<v Speaker 2>I think she's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan and I tweeted this many times </v>

2577
01:40:37.261 --> 01:40:40.260
<v Speaker 2>along that the UFC needs to make 145 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pound women's division,</v>

2578
01:40:40.290 --> 01:40:44.970
<v Speaker 2>but there's also some realities that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to address and those realities have</v>

2579
01:40:44.971 --> 01:40:45.804
<v Speaker 2>to be addressed for the other women that</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't done anything as well to still </v>

2580
01:40:48.450 --> 01:40:49.283
<v Speaker 2>look up for them.</v>

2581
01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right about that.</v>

2582
01:40:50.651 --> 01:40:53.050
<v Speaker 1>I think that when people test positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2583
01:40:53.290 --> 01:40:54.370
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the penalties</v>

2584
01:40:54.370 --> 01:40:55.720
<v Speaker 5>have to be harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have to be hard.</v>

2585
01:40:55.721 --> 01:40:59.560
<v Speaker 5>And I don't know what's going on with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the new testing and stuff like that.</v>

2586
01:40:59.561 --> 01:41:00.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2587
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm not in the know when it comes to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>UFC,</v>

2588
01:41:02.891 --> 01:41:04.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm no longer on a team,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

2589
01:41:04.391 --> 01:41:06.430
<v Speaker 5>It's like everything I do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've read through MMA media now,</v>

2590
01:41:06.431 --> 01:41:07.380
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2591
01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:09.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who's testing one and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what's going on,</v>

2592
01:41:09.341 --> 01:41:12.580
<v Speaker 5>but I will say that the men had been </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing it for so long as well.</v>

2593
01:41:12.581 --> 01:41:17.050
<v Speaker 5>So should men who were clean have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have fought against men who were dirty?</v>

2594
01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:19.030
<v Speaker 5>Very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people think they shouldn't.</v>

2595
01:41:19.090 --> 01:41:19.923
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know what we do about clean </v>

2596
01:41:22.091 --> 01:41:23.080
<v Speaker 5>slating at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at this point.</v>

2597
01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:25.060
<v Speaker 5>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it the same thing?</v>

2598
01:41:25.090 --> 01:41:25.923
<v Speaker 5>Is a man taking male hormones the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a woman taking male hormone already </v>

2599
01:41:29.531 --> 01:41:31.390
<v Speaker 5>has the male hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2600
01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:36.060
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't that be even more of an </v>
<v Speaker 5>increase than a woman taking?</v>

2601
01:41:36.061 --> 01:41:37.060
<v Speaker 5>Cause if a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2602
01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:38.170
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2603
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:39.303
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because a woman's adjusting her </v>

2604
01:41:39.701 --> 01:41:40.534
<v Speaker 5>physiology and becoming masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whereas a man is becoming more </v>

2605
01:41:42.461 --> 01:41:44.260
<v Speaker 5>masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>

2606
01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:45.293
<v Speaker 5>which is a shift literally in the body </v>
<v Speaker 5>structure that happens to women when </v>

2607
01:41:48.101 --> 01:41:52.330
<v Speaker 5>they start taking testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why a transgender man goes from a</v>

2608
01:41:52.331 --> 01:41:54.510
<v Speaker 5>woman to a man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All such grows a beard,</v>

2609
01:41:54.570 --> 01:41:55.403
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chaz Bono changes the shape of your </v>

2610
01:41:56.651 --> 01:41:58.510
<v Speaker 5>face,</v>
<v Speaker 5>changes the tone of your voice,</v>

2611
01:41:58.511 --> 01:42:00.040
<v Speaker 5>your voice gets deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2612
01:42:00.041 --> 01:42:02.260
<v Speaker 5>so many different factors play in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2613
01:42:02.261 --> 01:42:04.090
<v Speaker 5>it's really depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no,</v>

2614
01:42:04.150 --> 01:42:07.540
<v Speaker 5>there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a rainbow or a broad spectrum of</v>

2615
01:42:07.541 --> 01:42:09.730
<v Speaker 5>dosages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like who knows how much you're taking,</v>

2616
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:10.743
<v Speaker 5>how long you're taking it for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there's also massive negative </v>

2617
01:42:14.441 --> 01:42:16.990
<v Speaker 5>consequences health wise for women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's,</v>

2618
01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:19.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's already hell on your body to fight.</v>

2619
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:20.263
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's hell on your body to be a </v>

2620
01:42:21.131 --> 01:42:23.500
<v Speaker 5>female athlete in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's wonderful and encouraging,</v>

2621
01:42:23.530 --> 01:42:24.990
<v Speaker 5>but you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

2622
01:42:24.991 --> 01:42:27.160
<v Speaker 5>I again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have an answer for that.</v>

2623
01:42:27.161 --> 01:42:27.994
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's a clean slate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do think that Cris Cyborg is in the </v>

2624
01:42:30.161 --> 01:42:30.994
<v Speaker 5>position right now with our career and </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the things have been questioned </v>

2625
01:42:33.431 --> 01:42:34.330
<v Speaker 5>about are the things that have been </v>
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>

2626
01:42:34.331 --> 01:42:39.331
<v Speaker 5>She has actually opportunity now to </v>
<v Speaker 5>really spearhead making it all clean and</v>

2627
01:42:39.341 --> 01:42:40.031
<v Speaker 5>coming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2628
01:42:40.031 --> 01:42:42.680
<v Speaker 5>coming forward with whatever happened in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the past with the spiritual,</v>

2629
01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:45.190
<v Speaker 5>I forgot the name of [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of that,</v>

2630
01:42:45.191 --> 01:42:48.010
<v Speaker 5>but that was concerned because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>really a performance enhancing drug.</v>

2631
01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:52.430
<v Speaker 5>The spironolactone is not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not performance enhancing style.</v>

2632
01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:54.573
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't a failed test then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was not prohibited or it is </v>

2633
01:42:57.671 --> 01:42:59.290
<v Speaker 5>prohibited.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But she could get a,</v>

2634
01:42:59.330 --> 01:43:01.810
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>therapy therapeutic use exemption.</v>

2635
01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:02.620
<v Speaker 5>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

2636
01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:03.453
<v Speaker 5>I think she did it achieve,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're doing that or in the process of </v>

2637
01:43:06.011 --> 01:43:08.800
<v Speaker 5>trying to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it has been cleared.</v>

2638
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:10.750
<v Speaker 5>What that means is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2639
01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:13.000
<v Speaker 5>it's not hurting anybody she competes </v>
<v Speaker 5>against.</v>

2640
01:43:13.001 --> 01:43:16.510
<v Speaker 5>It's not that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't like people taking it because</v>

2641
01:43:16.511 --> 01:43:20.220
<v Speaker 5>it can mask some of the effects of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Androgens in,</v>

2642
01:43:20.230 --> 01:43:22.360
<v Speaker 5>in the female body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it also,</v>

2643
01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:24.460
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a diuretic.</v>

2644
01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:25.653
<v Speaker 5>Diuretics are illegal because diuretics </v>
<v Speaker 5>also can mask some of the potential </v>

2645
01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:35.440
<v Speaker 5>properties of testosterone or hormones </v>
<v Speaker 5>or they did away with all the ivy.</v>

2646
01:43:35.441 --> 01:43:38.910
<v Speaker 5>Rehydration is only person who liked ivy</v>
<v Speaker 5>and rehydration.</v>

2647
01:43:39.050 --> 01:43:39.883
<v Speaker 5>You're the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a lot of people like to </v>

2648
01:43:41.410 --> 01:43:43.630
<v Speaker 5>live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I was clean.</v>

2649
01:43:44.050 --> 01:43:44.883
<v Speaker 5>I hate to say that I was clean my whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>life but I was po possibly because </v>

2650
01:43:48.701 --> 01:43:49.534
<v Speaker 5>nobody ever offered me anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If somebody offered you steroids you </v>

2651
01:43:51.141 --> 01:43:51.860
<v Speaker 5>thing you would have taken it.</v>

2652
01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:53.270
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I look back now and I'm like,</v>

2653
01:43:53.271 --> 01:43:55.610
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how many other women anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2654
01:43:55.611 --> 01:43:57.440
<v Speaker 5>What if it was back in the day like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>wild west,</v>

2655
01:43:57.441 --> 01:44:00.230
<v Speaker 5>like pride days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like pride days where the wild west,</v>

2656
01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:01.393
<v Speaker 5>like during pride,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I talked to [inaudible] in any way </v>

2657
01:44:03.411 --> 01:44:04.244
<v Speaker 5>he dealt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he described about his con is contract </v>

2658
01:44:05.991 --> 01:44:10.280
<v Speaker 5>literally in capital letter said we will</v>
<v Speaker 5>not test you for steroids and answer was</v>

2659
01:44:10.281 --> 01:44:13.010
<v Speaker 5>laughing about it and was like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody was on shit back then.</v>

2660
01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:17.840
<v Speaker 5>Did that question I think I probably </v>
<v Speaker 5>would have if I'd have been offered it.</v>

2661
01:44:17.841 --> 01:44:18.674
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then you think about that and then </v>

2662
01:44:19.431 --> 01:44:20.330
<v Speaker 5>you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2663
01:44:20.630 --> 01:44:23.180
<v Speaker 5>2011 was just on the cusp of being the </v>
<v Speaker 5>wild west.</v>

2664
01:44:23.181 --> 01:44:26.660
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if she did take steroids,</v>

2665
01:44:26.661 --> 01:44:27.494
<v Speaker 5>if she was on something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't that just what everybody else was </v>

2666
01:44:29.961 --> 01:44:30.794
<v Speaker 5>trying to do?</v>

2667
01:44:31.010 --> 01:44:32.960
<v Speaker 5>Some people were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think Gina was doing it.</v>

2668
01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.590
<v Speaker 5>Gina Carano Gina did it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2669
01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:37.910
<v Speaker 5>some women definitely did for shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2670
01:44:37.911 --> 01:44:39.800
<v Speaker 5>you look at the old pictures that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighters,</v>

2671
01:44:39.801 --> 01:44:43.310
<v Speaker 5>the generation before me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not throwing out accusations,</v>

2672
01:44:43.311 --> 01:44:45.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying people with Musculature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2673
01:44:45.250 --> 01:44:46.940
<v Speaker 5>like Becky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Levi and people like that.</v>

2674
01:44:46.941 --> 01:44:48.740
<v Speaker 5>You kind of wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2675
01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:50.840
<v Speaker 5>how much of that was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2676
01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:52.333
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know girls that just compete in Jiu </v>

2677
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:54.240
<v Speaker 5>Jitsu tournaments,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that dues test,</v>

2678
01:44:54.241 --> 01:44:56.090
<v Speaker 5>test testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2679
01:44:56.091 --> 01:44:58.760
<v Speaker 5>they just want to be stronger and better</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's no money in it.</v>

2680
01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:01.670
<v Speaker 5>They're just trying to get an edge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's kind of weird.</v>

2681
01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:02.300
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2682
01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:03.920
<v Speaker 5>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2683
01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:04.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

2684
01:45:04.890 --> 01:45:05.723
<v Speaker 5>it's amateur and no one's testing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they say everyone's doing it so they're </v>

2685
01:45:09.321 --> 01:45:10.250
<v Speaker 5>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you go,</v>

2686
01:45:10.251 --> 01:45:11.060
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2687
01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:12.350
<v Speaker 5>I've got no position on this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2688
01:45:12.351 --> 01:45:13.280
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what to say,</v>

2689
01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:17.390
<v Speaker 5>but when it comes to mma and when it </v>
<v Speaker 5>comes to professional sports,</v>

2690
01:45:17.391 --> 01:45:19.700
<v Speaker 5>and back then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it was the wild west,</v>

2691
01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:22.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure a lot of people were doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2692
01:45:22.670 --> 01:45:26.240
<v Speaker 5>But Chris Cyborg became sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>poster girl when she looked the part and</v>

2693
01:45:26.241 --> 01:45:27.200
<v Speaker 5>then tested positive.</v>

2694
01:45:29.210 --> 01:45:30.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do we do with that now?</v>

2695
01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:32.140
<v Speaker 5>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do we do it,</v>

2696
01:45:32.630 --> 01:45:35.510
<v Speaker 5>because the guidebook,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think she's a phenomenal woman.</v>

2697
01:45:35.511 --> 01:45:36.344
<v Speaker 5>I think she's a kind and good woman and </v>
<v Speaker 5>a wonderful fighter for people to look </v>

2698
01:45:39.231 --> 01:45:41.090
<v Speaker 5>up to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I don't,</v>

2699
01:45:41.810 --> 01:45:44.810
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what you do with that now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that what has to go on the table</v>

2700
01:45:44.811 --> 01:45:45.644
<v Speaker 5>is just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we take everything by what happens </v>

2701
01:45:48.261 --> 01:45:52.010
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if a person doesn't test positive,</v>

2702
01:45:52.250 --> 01:45:54.950
<v Speaker 5>we take them at their word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The real problem though,</v>

2703
01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:58.430
<v Speaker 5>with what's going on today as they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>offering these massively steep,</v>

2704
01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:02.090
<v Speaker 5>steep sentences for people and </v>
<v Speaker 5>suspensions for people.</v>

2705
01:46:02.091 --> 01:46:05.750
<v Speaker 5>So like first if you get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the first suspension is like two</v>

2706
01:46:05.751 --> 01:46:09.290
<v Speaker 5>years and that if you get caught again </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's even deeper and then three years,</v>

2707
01:46:09.291 --> 01:46:11.360
<v Speaker 5>it's three times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you get caught a third time,</v>

2708
01:46:11.361 --> 01:46:12.194
<v Speaker 5>it's like life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Vander Lee silver one is the most </v>

2709
01:46:14.871 --> 01:46:15.704
<v Speaker 5>disturbing one to me because he ran away</v>
<v Speaker 5>from a test and they banned him for </v>

2710
01:46:18.681 --> 01:46:19.040
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

2711
01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.290
<v Speaker 5>Like die is fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's abusive.</v>

2712
01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:22.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gotta wonder how many other fighters</v>

2713
01:46:22.911 --> 01:46:25.730
<v Speaker 5>have run away from it but it just wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>as public like you know.</v>

2714
01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:27.110
<v Speaker 5>Sure it will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>

2715
01:46:27.111 --> 01:46:27.944
<v Speaker 5>but when you talk to chill son and about</v>
<v Speaker 5>how sketchy the Usada people were when </v>

2716
01:46:30.831 --> 01:46:31.664
<v Speaker 5>they came to him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they made them do it in a broom </v>

2717
01:46:32.811 --> 01:46:35.090
<v Speaker 5>closet and give boys like this is this </v>
<v Speaker 5>sterile?</v>

2718
01:46:35.091 --> 01:46:36.500
<v Speaker 5>Like who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you have an id?</v>

2719
01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:38.690
<v Speaker 5>Like they don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't want to give you ID.</v>

2720
01:46:38.691 --> 01:46:42.260
<v Speaker 5>They just want to test right away and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you just have to listen to them.</v>

2721
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:45.380
<v Speaker 5>In the case of him where they may be </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to hawk.</v>

2722
01:46:45.381 --> 01:46:47.910
<v Speaker 5>I am a little bit more just because of </v>
<v Speaker 5>his past shown,</v>

2723
01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:49.650
<v Speaker 5>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2724
01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:51.413
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when it comes to </v>

2725
01:46:53.641 --> 01:46:55.800
<v Speaker 3>regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who regulates the regulators?</v>

2726
01:46:55.801 --> 01:46:57.180
<v Speaker 3>Like that is the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2727
01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:58.560
<v Speaker 3>The question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2728
01:46:58.710 --> 01:47:02.790
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't want this taken away from us.</v>

2729
01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:04.890
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this whole thing that the,</v>

2730
01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:06.870
<v Speaker 3>the moments of passion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Darren Elkins moments,</v>

2731
01:47:06.871 --> 01:47:07.704
<v Speaker 3>we don't want that taken away from us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to have that soured by knowing that </v>

2732
01:47:10.921 --> 01:47:13.590
<v Speaker 3>that person was cheating was cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2733
01:47:13.591 --> 01:47:14.424
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a huge emotional </v>

2734
01:47:16.141 --> 01:47:17.910
<v Speaker 3>investment to see a clean sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2735
01:47:17.911 --> 01:47:20.430
<v Speaker 3>how about the greatest of gray areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is Vito Belfort.</v>

2736
01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:21.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They let them,</v>

2737
01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:23.160
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they let them,</v>

2738
01:47:23.250 --> 01:47:23.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2739
01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:26.880
<v Speaker 2>who is a testosterone use exemption and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was doing it,</v>

2740
01:47:26.881 --> 01:47:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2741
01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:28.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looked terrified.</v>

2742
01:47:28.930 --> 01:47:30.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looked like 19 year old beach.</v>

2743
01:47:31.330 --> 01:47:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2744
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Crazier than 19 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he looked like a demon.</v>

2745
01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:36.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vito would come out and just starch.</v>

2746
01:47:36.391 --> 01:47:37.224
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was smashing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll kick luke rockhold when we never </v>

2747
01:47:40.051 --> 01:47:40.884
<v Speaker 2>seen him throw a wheel in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He threw two wheel kicks in his entire </v>

2748
01:47:43.441 --> 01:47:45.660
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh look at the pictures of him.</v>

2749
01:47:45.690 --> 01:47:50.690
<v Speaker 2>This is 2007 on the left in 2000 or 2012</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the left and 2017 on the right.</v>

2750
01:47:51.801 --> 01:47:53.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking a</v>

2751
01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:56.050
<v Speaker 3>that poor guy though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine being on that level?</v>

2752
01:47:56.051 --> 01:47:57.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take testosterone.</v>

2753
01:47:57.760 --> 01:47:58.593
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So can you imagine being on that level </v>

2754
01:47:59.531 --> 01:48:01.540
<v Speaker 3>where you feel like your body is in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain,</v>

2755
01:48:01.541 --> 01:48:02.374
<v Speaker 3>it can perform a certain way and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>have that taken away from you and then </v>

2756
01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:06.513
<v Speaker 3>like just having to compete with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then compete with whatever's going </v>

2757
01:48:08.501 --> 01:48:09.600
<v Speaker 3>on in your mind too?</v>

2758
01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the thing is that with youth is,</v>

2759
01:48:13.370 --> 01:48:16.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have all this athletic ability,</v>

2760
01:48:16.101 --> 01:48:16.934
<v Speaker 2>you have all the strength and speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have any experience and </v>

2761
01:48:19.791 --> 01:48:20.624
<v Speaker 2>wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as you gain experience and </v>

2762
01:48:21.801 --> 01:48:22.634
<v Speaker 2>wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>father time slowly takes away your </v>

2763
01:48:24.321 --> 01:48:26.270
<v Speaker 2>physical gifts to the point where you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to,</v>

2764
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:28.610
<v Speaker 2>like Bernard Hopkins when he fought Joe </v>
<v Speaker 2>Smith,</v>

2765
01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:31.070
<v Speaker 2>there was that weird moment where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize like,</v>

2766
01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:31.933
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've passed the point here where your </v>

2767
01:48:33.891 --> 01:48:34.724
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and your hard work and </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline makes up for the fact that </v>

2768
01:48:37.791 --> 01:48:39.320
<v Speaker 2>your body's deteriorating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2769
01:48:39.410 --> 01:48:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Then you're fighting this young bulldog </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's just an animal.</v>

2770
01:48:42.290 --> 01:48:43.920
<v Speaker 2>He went through the ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2771
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:45.440
<v Speaker 2>he fell on his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was horrible.</v>

2772
01:48:45.441 --> 01:48:48.860
<v Speaker 2>The meeting really made me think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the way boxing rings are set up.</v>

2773
01:48:48.861 --> 01:48:49.694
<v Speaker 2>Like how the fuck is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So easy to fall through the ropes and </v>

2774
01:48:52.131 --> 01:48:52.964
<v Speaker 2>why or why is there no one there to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happening and catch them like he </v>

2775
01:48:56.361 --> 01:48:58.850
<v Speaker 2>fell on his head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know where the fuck he was,</v>

2776
01:48:58.851 --> 01:49:01.310
<v Speaker 2>didn't know what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So dangerous.</v>

2777
01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:04.400
<v Speaker 2>So dangerous when you get a died there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way he fell back to,</v>

2778
01:49:04.401 --> 01:49:05.234
<v Speaker 2>he literally fell head first and landed </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ground and I'm assuming it was </v>

2779
01:49:08.961 --> 01:49:10.040
<v Speaker 2>concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2780
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:11.623
<v Speaker 2>and didn't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't know where he was thought he got </v>

2781
01:49:13.581 --> 01:49:15.920
<v Speaker 2>pushed out of the ring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know he got knocked out.</v>

2782
01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:17.420
<v Speaker 2>It was just so out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2783
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:18.383
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there comes the time when we have to </v>

2784
01:49:19.321 --> 01:49:22.650
<v Speaker 3>recognize our mortality and </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately fighters are not people to</v>

2785
01:49:22.651 --> 01:49:24.520
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you look too,</v>

2786
01:49:24.650 --> 01:49:25.250
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2787
01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:27.230
<v Speaker 2>She didn't have to recognize it for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of years.</v>

2788
01:49:27.231 --> 01:49:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The turn back the time,</v>

2789
01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:29.953
<v Speaker 2>I mean you went from Vitor Belfort who </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought rich Franklin Vito Belfort who </v>

2790
01:49:33.531 --> 01:49:36.350
<v Speaker 2>fought a sexy yama and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look good.</v>

2791
01:49:36.650 --> 01:49:38.810
<v Speaker 2>But then when he got on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone,</v>

2792
01:49:38.811 --> 01:49:40.880
<v Speaker 2>it's like all of a sudden you have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenom,</v>

2793
01:49:41.190 --> 01:49:42.350
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this demon</v>

2794
01:49:42.430 --> 01:49:43.263
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a therapeutic use exemption stuff </v>

2795
01:49:45.831 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 3>that it seemed to spike a certain time </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a lot</v>

2796
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.300
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that found out?</v>

2797
01:49:49.301 --> 01:49:51.840
<v Speaker 1>It was legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a bunch of shitty.</v>

2798
01:49:51.841 --> 01:49:52.730
<v Speaker 1>As doctors.</v>

2799
01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:54.233
<v Speaker 2>I know some people who use some shady </v>
<v Speaker 2>ass doctors and what the doctor would </v>

2800
01:49:57.361 --> 01:50:00.690
<v Speaker 2>literally tell them is you take </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone for a short amount of time,</v>

2801
01:50:00.691 --> 01:50:01.950
<v Speaker 2>take a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2802
01:50:02.190 --> 01:50:06.000
<v Speaker 2>get your system hooked on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then get off of it and then get tested.</v>

2803
01:50:06.150 --> 01:50:07.690
<v Speaker 2>So then they will go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2804
01:50:07.710 --> 01:50:11.220
<v Speaker 2>just got low testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because your body,</v>

2805
01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:15.750
<v Speaker 2>you jolted it down with like 10 weeks of</v>
<v Speaker 2>high level test and then you say,</v>

2806
01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:19.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm feeling a little run down and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>I have something wrong with me.</v>

2807
01:50:19.381 --> 01:50:20.214
<v Speaker 2>I have a medical condition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a lot of it was just guys who </v>

2808
01:50:22.231 --> 01:50:27.231
<v Speaker 2>take steroids and their body had stopped</v>
<v Speaker 2>producing it naturally and then they got</v>

2809
01:50:28.081 --> 01:50:28.914
<v Speaker 2>a therapeutic use exemption and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were shooting it up all the time and </v>

2810
01:50:30.691 --> 01:50:32.640
<v Speaker 2>then they were going in there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're 27 years old.</v>

2811
01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:37.380
<v Speaker 1>So the benefits of the previous steroid </v>
<v Speaker 1>use didn't linger to the point that,</v>

2812
01:50:37.410 --> 01:50:39.300
<v Speaker 1>or was it a mental thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2813
01:50:39.330 --> 01:50:40.890
<v Speaker 1>the benefits there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they,</v>

2814
01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:41.910
<v Speaker 1>if their endocrine system</v>

2815
01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:42.853
<v Speaker 2>caught up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say say if they did a certain amount of </v>

2816
01:50:44.361 --> 01:50:47.180
<v Speaker 2>cycles and they gained a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>of strength there,</v>

2817
01:50:47.210 --> 01:50:48.043
<v Speaker 2>they would come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would keep some of that benefit </v>

2818
01:50:49.670 --> 01:50:52.910
<v Speaker 2>permanently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when their end to consistent crashed</v>

2819
01:50:52.911 --> 01:50:54.950
<v Speaker 2>because they had taken all the stores </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they got off of it,</v>

2820
01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:58.310
<v Speaker 2>that's when they can test and the test </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows low testosterone.</v>

2821
01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.250
<v Speaker 2>That's all they needed to show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't,</v>

2822
01:51:00.270 --> 01:51:00.660
<v Speaker 2>didn't need.</v>

2823
01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:01.493
<v Speaker 1>She could still physically perform to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher level than they could have if </v>

2824
01:51:03.591 --> 01:51:05.270
<v Speaker 1>they've never done steroids in the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>place</v>

2825
01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:08.070
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But while they're at a low testosterone,</v>

2826
01:51:08.071 --> 01:51:08.904
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna experience very </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant decreases in endurance and </v>

2827
01:51:11.311 --> 01:51:13.410
<v Speaker 2>stamina and your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your intensity,</v>

2828
01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:16.740
<v Speaker 2>all that's going to be down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body's like really depressed.</v>

2829
01:51:17.070 --> 01:51:17.903
<v Speaker 2>Like that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to men when they get head </v>

2830
01:51:19.771 --> 01:51:20.604
<v Speaker 2>injuries is that head injuries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>traumatic brain injuries cause a </v>

2831
01:51:23.491 --> 01:51:24.324
<v Speaker 2>disruption in the pituitary gland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which causes your body to produce less </v>

2832
01:51:26.761 --> 01:51:30.450
<v Speaker 2>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which oftentimes leads to soldiers,</v>

2833
01:51:30.451 --> 01:51:33.180
<v Speaker 2>football players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters becoming severely depressed and</v>

2834
01:51:33.181 --> 01:51:36.660
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes they lane towards alcoholism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and drug addiction.</v>

2835
01:51:36.661 --> 01:51:38.850
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of that is trying to combat </v>
<v Speaker 2>that depression.</v>

2836
01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:41.490
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that makes a great deal of sense.</v>

2837
01:51:41.491 --> 01:51:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I was never tested to the extent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2838
01:51:43.501 --> 01:51:44.700
<v Speaker 1>but when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I quit fighting,</v>

2839
01:51:44.701 --> 01:51:45.534
<v Speaker 1>I was put on estrogen because I have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really messed up reproductive system </v>

2840
01:51:48.511 --> 01:51:50.370
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I was like,</v>

2841
01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:53.640
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have polycystic ovarian syndrome,</v>

2842
01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:55.220
<v Speaker 1>which it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's anyway,</v>

2843
01:51:55.230 --> 01:51:56.063
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was put on a birth control pill with </v>

2844
01:51:57.121 --> 01:52:00.990
<v Speaker 1>very high estrogen and that led me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go on antidepressants,</v>

2845
01:52:01.110 --> 01:52:02.670
<v Speaker 1>which led me have to go into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I mean it,</v>

2846
01:52:02.671 --> 01:52:03.504
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just the amount of estrogen </v>

2847
01:52:04.650 --> 01:52:05.610
<v Speaker 1>leads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do what?</v>

2848
01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:08.870
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to have babies really badly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2849
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I had horrible not to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put whatever we're talking about.</v>

2850
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I was,</v>

2851
01:52:14.370 --> 01:52:15.860
<v Speaker 1>while I was fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I um,</v>

2852
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:16.833
<v Speaker 1>I had horrible periods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I would have periods for an entire </v>

2853
01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:21.450
<v Speaker 1>month and stuff like that while I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

2854
01:52:21.450 --> 01:52:22.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when my body fat lowered for </v>

2855
01:52:23.461 --> 01:52:24.480
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2856
01:52:24.481 --> 01:52:27.410
<v Speaker 1>women are supposed to stop and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to intern men or it,</v>

2857
01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:29.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for me it was different and I would,</v>

2858
01:52:29.850 --> 01:52:31.380
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was bleeding all the time.</v>

2859
01:52:31.381 --> 01:52:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Like it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a long 10 years,</v>

2860
01:52:34.170 --> 01:52:34.831
<v Speaker 1>but he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2861
01:52:34.831 --> 01:52:36.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my body was really,</v>

2862
01:52:36.301 --> 01:52:37.134
<v Speaker 1>really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I stopped fighting I was </v>

2863
01:52:38.671 --> 01:52:39.240
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

2864
01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I was sick of being in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sick of this and that.</v>

2865
01:52:41.071 --> 01:52:42.240
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to.</v>

2866
01:52:42.241 --> 01:52:43.074
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to put any chemicals into </v>

2867
01:52:44.881 --> 01:52:45.950
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was fighting,</v>

2868
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:49.130
<v Speaker 1>I was really worried about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like worried about if that would make me</v>

2869
01:52:49.131 --> 01:52:51.530
<v Speaker 1>gain weight if I went on the birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>control pill or something like that,</v>

2870
01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:53.120
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I quit fighting,</v>

2871
01:52:53.121 --> 01:52:53.954
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a gynecologist and she put me </v>

2872
01:52:54.621 --> 01:52:56.120
<v Speaker 1>on it and then it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I crashed,</v>

2873
01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know which birth control pill it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

2874
01:52:58.191 --> 01:52:59.024
<v Speaker 1>but I was severely depressed when I quit</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting the birth control pills cause </v>

2875
01:53:02.121 --> 01:53:03.690
<v Speaker 1>depression irregulated regulated.</v>

2876
01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:04.543
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if eight caused depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would say that the changing </v>

2877
01:53:06.201 --> 01:53:08.960
<v Speaker 1>chemicals in my body post fight so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>

2878
01:53:08.970 --> 01:53:10.580
<v Speaker 1>you can't just say it's like this one </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2879
01:53:10.581 --> 01:53:12.410
<v Speaker 1>but I would say heightened estrogen </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

2880
01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:15.020
<v Speaker 1>I was all of a sudden eating carbs again</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first time and for,</v>

2881
01:53:15.021 --> 01:53:16.880
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of things were different.</v>

2882
01:53:17.150 --> 01:53:19.520
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't exercising however many hours a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

2883
01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Everything in my life was different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I will say,</v>

2884
01:53:21.651 --> 01:53:22.484
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put on 30 pounds within six months of </v>

2885
01:53:24.501 --> 01:53:26.010
<v Speaker 1>retiring like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2886
01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:26.721
<v Speaker 1>it was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2887
01:53:26.721 --> 01:53:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I have breasts zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a great thing,</v>

2888
01:53:28.491 --> 01:53:30.500
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't something I was used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a decade.</v>

2889
01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:32.420
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2890
01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:36.230
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so funny about how when your,</v>

2891
01:53:36.231 --> 01:53:39.050
<v Speaker 1>your reproductive chemicals or when all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets messed up,</v>

2892
01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:40.850
<v Speaker 1>how that actually messes with your brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

2893
01:53:41.150 --> 01:53:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Because I can understand these men </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming off of of head injuries.</v>

2894
01:53:44.151 --> 01:53:44.984
<v Speaker 1>If they're having a decreased like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical like testosterone or whatever </v>

2895
01:53:48.801 --> 01:53:49.634
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can understand that actual weirdness </v>

2896
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:57.500
<v Speaker 1>like taking part and that affecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>their brains severely in the shutdown of</v>

2897
01:53:57.530 --> 01:54:01.010
<v Speaker 1>the steroid cycles is a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

2898
01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:03.590
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's led people to suicide.</v>

2899
01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:06.440
<v Speaker 1>And if you're inclined towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression in the first place,</v>

2900
01:54:06.441 --> 01:54:08.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets accentuated.</v>

2901
01:54:08.210 --> 01:54:09.043
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

2902
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:11.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a big history of depression in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my family.</v>

2903
01:54:11.451 --> 01:54:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I went through a really rough time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2904
01:54:13.610 --> 01:54:14.443
<v Speaker 1>and then remarkably I discovered writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was great and it's led me on a </v>

2905
01:54:18.891 --> 01:54:20.510
<v Speaker 1>completely different path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2906
01:54:20.530 --> 01:54:22.460
<v Speaker 1>a post fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about that.</v>

2907
01:54:22.461 --> 01:54:23.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2908
01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:24.193
<v Speaker 1>think the chemicals are a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor and I'm not a </v>

2909
01:54:26.721 --> 01:54:27.740
<v Speaker 1>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my family.</v>

2910
01:54:27.741 --> 01:54:28.610
<v Speaker 1>They're all scientists and shit.</v>

2911
01:54:28.610 --> 01:54:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any of it.</v>

2912
01:54:29.481 --> 01:54:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know the science behind it </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2913
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:32.690
<v Speaker 1>But I will say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2914
01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:33.553
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that it's necessarily </v>

2915
01:54:35.150 --> 01:54:38.120
<v Speaker 1>always chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's a big part of it.</v>

2916
01:54:38.121 --> 01:54:38.954
<v Speaker 1>It's also purposeful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you don't have a purpose </v>

2917
01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:43.220
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have a goal and something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to strive for,</v>

2918
01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:46.250
<v Speaker 1>then your body reacts to it as well and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain reacts to that as well.</v>

2919
01:54:46.251 --> 01:54:48.080
<v Speaker 1>So I think that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2920
01:54:48.110 --> 01:54:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I think that's something exercise thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2921
01:54:50.091 --> 01:54:54.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that played a big factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lack of exercise or the much greatly</v>

2922
01:54:54.381 --> 01:54:55.330
<v Speaker 1>reduced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2923
01:54:55.331 --> 01:54:56.720
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can run three miles a day,</v>

2924
01:54:56.721 --> 01:55:00.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same as sparring every </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day or whatever you're doing.</v>

2925
01:55:00.411 --> 01:55:00.861
<v Speaker 1>Or do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2926
01:55:00.861 --> 01:55:02.630
<v Speaker 1>doing Jujitsu twice a day or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2927
01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much of probably what depression is,</v>

2928
01:55:04.881 --> 01:55:07.640
<v Speaker 1>is so many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a giant combination of factors</v>

2929
01:55:08.190 --> 01:55:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2930
01:55:08.810 --> 01:55:09.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2931
01:55:09.321 --> 01:55:09.921
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

2932
01:55:09.921 --> 01:55:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm not as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a great therapist,</v>

2933
01:55:11.421 --> 01:55:12.470
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2934
01:55:12.471 --> 01:55:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2935
01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't say that,</v>

2936
01:55:16.251 --> 01:55:20.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is something to having all of that</v>

2937
01:55:20.121 --> 01:55:21.500
<v Speaker 1>in balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2938
01:55:21.590 --> 01:55:23.660
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being chemically,</v>

2939
01:55:23.661 --> 01:55:24.494
<v Speaker 1>I guess physiologically in balance with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way your body's supposed to be and </v>

2940
01:55:27.201 --> 01:55:28.740
<v Speaker 1>then have your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2941
01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:29.953
<v Speaker 1>exercise the way it's supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then have your purpose the way it's </v>

2942
01:55:31.761 --> 01:55:32.594
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's such a weird balance as human </v>

2943
01:55:34.461 --> 01:55:36.740
<v Speaker 1>beings that when any of you have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things get thrown out of whack,</v>

2944
01:55:37.530 --> 01:55:40.100
<v Speaker 1>you're headed for trouble and </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendships,</v>

2945
01:55:40.190 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the relationships that you</v>

2946
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:44.843
<v Speaker 2>keep in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this really interesting clip from </v>

2947
01:55:46.951 --> 01:55:50.280
<v Speaker 2>this guy and he was talking about is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a rapper.</v>

2948
01:55:50.281 --> 01:55:51.114
<v Speaker 2>I think he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's talking about his mental diet </v>

2949
01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:54.353
<v Speaker 2>and the way he looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that people are really </v>

2950
01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.280
<v Speaker 2>concentrating constantly about what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat,</v>

2951
01:55:59.730 --> 01:56:00.563
<v Speaker 2>but they're not concentrating constantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what they take in their mind and </v>

2952
01:56:04.051 --> 01:56:06.660
<v Speaker 2>that like you should really be aware of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mental diet too.</v>

2953
01:56:07.050 --> 01:56:09.750
<v Speaker 2>You know that if you snack on too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>junk food,</v>

2954
01:56:09.751 --> 01:56:11.670
<v Speaker 2>mentally it will weaken your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2955
01:56:11.671 --> 01:56:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2956
01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:13.790
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

2957
01:56:13.791 --> 01:56:14.624
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we don't push ourselves </v>

2958
01:56:15.981 --> 01:56:18.500
<v Speaker 3>mentally a lot and when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2959
01:56:18.590 --> 01:56:21.160
<v Speaker 3>I think honestly it's just coming down </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>

2960
01:56:21.170 --> 01:56:23.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a cure all that reading,</v>

2961
01:56:23.570 --> 01:56:24.403
<v Speaker 3>if you just read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just sit and force yourself to </v>

2962
01:56:25.941 --> 01:56:28.040
<v Speaker 3>read and you actually engage with </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacks,</v>

2963
01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:30.530
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden you realize something is</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening in your brain.</v>

2964
01:56:30.531 --> 01:56:33.530
<v Speaker 3>You're creating space for more thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your brain,</v>

2965
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:36.890
<v Speaker 3>but also you can't be exposed to too </v>
<v Speaker 3>much bullshit.</v>

2966
01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:38.720
<v Speaker 3>And who knows what's bullshit and what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not balls.</v>

2967
01:56:38.721 --> 01:56:39.554
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there has to be a discernment somewhere </v>

2968
01:56:40.311 --> 01:56:42.470
<v Speaker 3>along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of like,</v>

2969
01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:43.431
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

2970
01:56:43.431 --> 01:56:45.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2971
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:48.140
<v Speaker 3>Literary consciousness or something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that where you know that,</v>

2972
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:49.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm addicted to twitter,</v>

2973
01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:51.021
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2974
01:56:51.021 --> 01:56:52.190
<v Speaker 3>I love twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

2975
01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:56.120
<v Speaker 3>And I know that I'm a giant bitch on </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and I don't do your,</v>

2976
01:56:56.121 --> 01:56:56.990
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2977
01:56:56.991 --> 01:56:57.570
<v Speaker 3>you a bitch.</v>

2978
01:56:57.570 --> 01:56:59.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm always telling people to go fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

2979
01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:02.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like game because it's so enjoyable</v>

2980
01:57:02.061 --> 01:57:03.470
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like playing a game.</v>

2981
01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:05.740
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2982
01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:07.550
<v Speaker 3>the part of me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate that part of myself,</v>

2983
01:57:07.551 --> 01:57:09.800
<v Speaker 3>but I also really like it because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think I'm be coming.</v>

2984
01:57:09.801 --> 01:57:11.550
<v Speaker 3>It's to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not really,</v>

2985
01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:12.393
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a brand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no Julie Kedsey fighter who has </v>

2986
01:57:14.091 --> 01:57:16.420
<v Speaker 3>to impress anybody anymore like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2987
01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:18.530
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>granted I represent invicta to a certain</v>

2988
01:57:18.531 --> 01:57:19.364
<v Speaker 3>extent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know I fully understand that </v>

2989
01:57:21.531 --> 01:57:24.530
<v Speaker 3>Shannon could fire me if I say something</v>
<v Speaker 3>just outrageous and horrible.</v>

2990
01:57:24.531 --> 01:57:25.364
<v Speaker 3>She wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a wonderful person and I'm no </v>

2991
01:57:26.661 --> 01:57:28.520
<v Speaker 3>longer at behind the scenes there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

2992
01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:29.413
<v Speaker 3>I'm a commentator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not somebody making any decisions </v>

2993
01:57:31.131 --> 01:57:32.240
<v Speaker 3>with the company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2994
01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:35.090
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to twitter,</v>

2995
01:57:35.410 --> 01:57:37.560
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get in flame wars with people.</v>

2996
01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Some street shit too.</v>

2997
01:57:39.610 --> 01:57:40.443
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of enjoy when people insult me </v>

2998
01:57:41.681 --> 01:57:42.730
<v Speaker 3>and I go after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2999
01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:45.280
<v Speaker 3>But I do feel my brain deteriorating a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit when they do that.</v>

3000
01:57:45.310 --> 01:57:46.530
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just like I would,</v>

3001
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:47.430
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

3002
01:57:47.431 --> 01:57:47.951
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3003
01:57:47.951 --> 01:57:49.900
<v Speaker 3>I need to stop me to put this down now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3004
01:57:49.901 --> 01:57:51.010
<v Speaker 3>when they come at me and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3005
01:57:51.011 --> 01:57:52.660
<v Speaker 3>you're a Feminazi your this who I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>come on up.</v>

3007
01:57:54.230 --> 01:57:56.770
<v Speaker 3>Feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very outspoken.</v>

3008
01:57:56.771 --> 01:57:57.890
<v Speaker 3>Being a feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very,</v>

3009
01:57:57.910 --> 01:57:59.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when I talk about socialism,</v>

3010
01:57:59.361 --> 01:58:01.450
<v Speaker 3>when I talk about I hate Donald Trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I talk about this,</v>

3011
01:58:01.451 --> 01:58:02.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Yep,</v>

3012
01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:07.160
<v Speaker 2>I would never label you in like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a genuine person.</v>

3013
01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Like who happens to be a woman who </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes what you believe.</v>

3014
01:58:10.281 --> 01:58:12.290
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not like sexist.</v>

3015
01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:14.400
<v Speaker 2>You're not like anti male or anytime.</v>

3016
01:58:14.930 --> 01:58:15.763
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3017
01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:18.490
<v Speaker 3>I love men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe settle down.</v>

3018
01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:21.360
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3019
01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:25.340
<v Speaker 3>I am pro woman to certain sent me when </v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes to mma,</v>

3020
01:58:25.341 --> 01:58:26.174
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm more interested in what's going on </v>

3021
01:58:26.781 --> 01:58:29.630
<v Speaker 3>with women in the sport then with men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just where I'm oriented.</v>

3022
01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:32.180
<v Speaker 3>That's part of your job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

3023
01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:33.650
<v Speaker 3>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3024
01:58:33.651 --> 01:58:35.000
<v Speaker 3>there's this association though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

3025
01:58:35.001 --> 01:58:37.100
<v Speaker 3>the whole Feminazi label is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3026
01:58:37.101 --> 01:58:38.150
<v Speaker 3>that's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

3027
01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:39.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really proud to be a feminist.</v>

3028
01:58:39.741 --> 01:58:41.090
<v Speaker 3>And then people are just know that means</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hate,</v>

3029
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 3>you think they're all rapists.</v>

3030
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:42.550
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3031
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:45.560
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that discredits men so much.</v>

3032
01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:47.840
<v Speaker 5>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3033
01:58:47.950 --> 01:58:48.741
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's silly.</v>

3034
01:58:48.741 --> 01:58:52.640
<v Speaker 5>And that though the term feminist has </v>
<v Speaker 5>been so cooptive by negative thoughts.</v>

3035
01:58:53.090 --> 01:58:55.760
<v Speaker 5>So many people have this negative </v>
<v Speaker 5>connotation they attached to it,</v>

3036
01:58:55.790 --> 01:58:57.030
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and its movements that,</v>

3037
01:58:57.031 --> 01:58:57.864
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>third wave feminist and this and you </v>

3038
01:58:58.461 --> 01:58:59.294
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's certain when whenever the real </v>

3039
01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:02.990
<v Speaker 5>fucking problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>male feminists,</v>

3040
01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:03.853
<v Speaker 5>they've ruined it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those fucking twats men ruin everything </v>

3041
01:59:08.210 --> 01:59:09.140
<v Speaker 5>they've read even ruined.</v>

3042
01:59:10.730 --> 01:59:11.561
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3043
01:59:11.561 --> 01:59:12.394
<v Speaker 1>I know Jamie was on here and he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend of mine and something weird </v>

3044
01:59:14.061 --> 01:59:14.894
<v Speaker 1>happened with that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going on with his </v>

3045
01:59:16.161 --> 01:59:16.994
<v Speaker 1>life right now that I don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott and I don't want it like </v>

3046
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:21.260
<v Speaker 1>speculate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of that.</v>

3047
01:59:21.261 --> 01:59:23.030
<v Speaker 1>But we were really good friends for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>while and you know,</v>

3048
01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:28.040
<v Speaker 1>I know his like he was very disliked as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a male feminist,</v>

3049
01:59:28.041 --> 01:59:28.860
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote male.</v>

3050
01:59:28.860 --> 01:59:32.940
<v Speaker 5>Well it's because everybody thought that</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was what he just got accused of being</v>

3051
01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:36.300
<v Speaker 5>right and they're just coonhounds that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are taking that angle.</v>

3052
01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:41.820
<v Speaker 5>That is an interesting track.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Honestly think sometimes people are just</v>

3053
01:59:42.780 --> 01:59:44.160
<v Speaker 5>assholes who want sex.</v>

3054
01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:46.680
<v Speaker 1>And I also think sometimes people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulative assholes who want sex.</v>

3055
01:59:46.681 --> 01:59:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't see him as a manipulative </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

3056
01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:51.660
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might probably not,</v>

3057
01:59:51.661 --> 01:59:53.370
<v Speaker 1>I didn't interact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3058
01:59:53.890 --> 01:59:55.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't know either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3059
01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:55.953
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people are a bunch of different </v>

3060
01:59:56.861 --> 01:59:59.200
<v Speaker 5>things depending on who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what time of the day.</v>

3061
01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:00.513
<v Speaker 5>I think it'd be nice if the whole world </v>
<v Speaker 5>was egalitarianism and if we all looked </v>

3062
02:00:03.941 --> 02:00:06.190
<v Speaker 5>at people as just treating them,</v>

3063
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:08.183
<v Speaker 2>who they are based on their character </v>
<v Speaker 2>and their personality and not </v>

3064
02:00:11.161 --> 02:00:13.260
<v Speaker 2>categorizing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So specifically like,</v>

3065
02:00:13.290 --> 02:00:16.480
<v Speaker 2>oh you are a woman so you are less or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are a man and you are moving</v>

3066
02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:17.760
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or vice averse,</v>

3067
02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:19.070
<v Speaker 1>a male feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3068
02:00:19.071 --> 02:00:19.771
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3069
02:00:19.771 --> 02:00:24.771
<v Speaker 1>are you joking when you say no?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3070
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3071
02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:27.370
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3072
02:00:27.370 --> 02:00:28.203
<v Speaker 2>the problem is there's a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that virtue signal and a lot of people </v>

3073
02:00:31.361 --> 02:00:32.194
<v Speaker 2>that are posturing and a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are putting a label on themselves </v>

3074
02:00:34.811 --> 02:00:35.644
<v Speaker 2>to try to make themselves seem like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in a higher moral high ground </v>

3075
02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:41.290
<v Speaker 2>than the rest of the folks around them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the motivation for doing it.</v>

3076
02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:43.660
<v Speaker 2>That becomes transparent and people get </v>
<v Speaker 2>angry at that.</v>

3077
02:00:43.661 --> 02:00:44.494
<v Speaker 2>They recognize what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when someone like Jamie Kilstein </v>

3078
02:00:46.571 --> 02:00:48.850
<v Speaker 2>slips up after all these years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual signaling,</v>

3079
02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:49.841
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

3080
02:00:49.841 --> 02:00:51.190
<v Speaker 2>I knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fuck,</v>

3081
02:00:51.670 --> 02:00:54.470
<v Speaker 5>here's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does that really negate some of the good</v>

3082
02:00:54.471 --> 02:00:56.750
<v Speaker 5>things that he's done?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he's influenced some men?</v>

3083
02:00:56.780 --> 02:00:58.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess one of the good things,</v>

3084
02:00:59.030 --> 02:01:01.130
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he's maybe said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3085
02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:02.810
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a woman is actually a person.</v>

3086
02:01:03.130 --> 02:01:03.963
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's well,</v>

3087
02:01:04.010 --> 02:01:04.843
<v Speaker 5>absolutely full.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fuck doesn't think a woman as a </v>

3088
02:01:06.231 --> 02:01:07.064
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>

3089
02:01:07.770 --> 02:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Twitter timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people,</v>

3090
02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:11.153
<v Speaker 2>if there's a person out there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't think that a woman's a person </v>

3091
02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:15.870
<v Speaker 2>fucking Jamie Kilstein is not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change their opinion.</v>

3092
02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:16.733
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just going to broadcast it and let </v>

3093
02:01:18.781 --> 02:01:19.614
<v Speaker 2>everybody know that's how he thinks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to get all this love and </v>

3094
02:01:22.111 --> 02:01:22.944
<v Speaker 2>people are going to send them all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>likes and they're going to give them a </v>

3095
02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:28.510
<v Speaker 2>thumbs up and say nice things to him on </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter and that may</v>

3096
02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:31.720
<v Speaker 5>or may not be a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's more a good thing that a bad thing.</v>

3097
02:01:31.721 --> 02:01:33.460
<v Speaker 5>It's not a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're not going to change.</v>

3098
02:01:33.461 --> 02:01:36.430
<v Speaker 5>Some asshole opinion saying something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

3099
02:01:36.431 --> 02:01:37.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

3100
02:01:37.861 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you changed any assholes</v>

3101
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.530
<v Speaker 3>opinion with any group things that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've come out and said something,</v>

3102
02:01:42.531 --> 02:01:43.364
<v Speaker 3>have you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think you've changed people's </v>

3103
02:01:44.331 --> 02:01:44.740
<v Speaker 3>opinions?</v>

3104
02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:49.640
<v Speaker 2>I think things change if they value what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>

3105
02:01:49.670 --> 02:01:50.503
<v Speaker 2>if they believe that you're being </v>
<v Speaker 2>truthful and if what you're saying is </v>

3106
02:01:53.331 --> 02:01:56.000
<v Speaker 2>compelling enough for them to reconsider</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they look at things,</v>

3107
02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:57.313
<v Speaker 2>it is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not 100% and that's not the </v>

3108
02:02:00.501 --> 02:02:02.300
<v Speaker 2>motivation behind doing things in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>

3109
02:02:02.301 --> 02:02:03.134
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever try to change people's </v>

3110
02:02:04.641 --> 02:02:05.474
<v Speaker 2>opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do try to express myself as </v>

3111
02:02:06.921 --> 02:02:10.430
<v Speaker 2>cleanly and as accurately and as </v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly as I can.</v>

3112
02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:13.730
<v Speaker 2>And I think that in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my experience,</v>

3113
02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:16.400
<v Speaker 2>when I've heard people like you talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about your life,</v>

3114
02:02:16.401 --> 02:02:18.500
<v Speaker 2>like you just talking about your life in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this podcast,</v>

3115
02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:23.690
<v Speaker 2>I take that in and I know it's pure and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll make me consider every little,</v>

3116
02:02:24.190 --> 02:02:26.600
<v Speaker 2>every thing that a person says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every sentence,</v>

3117
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:27.703
<v Speaker 2>every conversation that you have with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone where they're being real with </v>

3118
02:02:30.141 --> 02:02:30.974
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it adds more knowledge to your database </v>

3119
02:02:34.041 --> 02:02:36.470
<v Speaker 2>of human interaction and the way people </v>
<v Speaker 2>behave and think.</v>

3120
02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:37.573
<v Speaker 2>Now thinking that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does slowly make you consider more </v>

3121
02:02:40.011 --> 02:02:40.844
<v Speaker 2>things about people and that adds to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>overall surface area of knowledge that </v>

3122
02:02:44.961 --> 02:02:46.310
<v Speaker 2>you have about people in general.</v>

3123
02:02:46.350 --> 02:02:47.183
<v Speaker 3>I absolutely do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You in your position because you have </v>

3124
02:02:49.941 --> 02:02:53.840
<v Speaker 3>considerable influence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you worry about having people kind of</v>

3125
02:02:53.841 --> 02:02:55.580
<v Speaker 3>latch on things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hive minded and,</v>

3126
02:02:55.581 --> 02:02:56.414
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go a direction that you feel a </v>

3127
02:02:57.531 --> 02:02:58.890
<v Speaker 3>responsibility I guess to people,</v>

3128
02:02:59.000 --> 02:02:59.833
<v Speaker 2>but definitely feel responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not manipulating them and it definitely </v>

3129
02:03:02.331 --> 02:03:03.164
<v Speaker 2>feel responsibility and not taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage of that and not starting a </v>

3130
02:03:05.751 --> 02:03:07.300
<v Speaker 2>cult or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3131
02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:08.533
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3132
02:03:08.630 --> 02:03:09.463
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the good part about it is if you don't </v>

3133
02:03:12.021 --> 02:03:12.854
<v Speaker 2>need anything from anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're not trying to get people to </v>

3134
02:03:15.921 --> 02:03:18.860
<v Speaker 2>send you $50 a month for the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3135
02:03:18.861 --> 02:03:23.210
<v Speaker 2>platinum plan where you got access to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the secret messages,</v>

3136
02:03:23.690 --> 02:03:25.310
<v Speaker 2>l Ron Hubbard or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3137
02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:26.333
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can take advantage of </v>

3138
02:03:27.831 --> 02:03:31.470
<v Speaker 2>people in certain ways and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3139
02:03:31.690 --> 02:03:32.523
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a real issue with any sort of </v>

3140
02:03:33.531 --> 02:03:35.000
<v Speaker 2>hive mind thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3141
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where I get,</v>

3142
02:03:37.291 --> 02:03:38.390
<v Speaker 3>I this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fascinating.</v>

3143
02:03:38.391 --> 02:03:39.224
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess religion and things like that </v>

3144
02:03:40.761 --> 02:03:43.250
<v Speaker 3>always troubled me and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that hive mind mentality that,</v>

3145
02:03:43.251 --> 02:03:43.760
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3146
02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:46.070
<v Speaker 3>that troubles me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It troubles me that,</v>

3147
02:03:46.370 --> 02:03:47.203
<v Speaker 3>I mean to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it troubles me that Alex Jones was on </v>

3148
02:03:49.281 --> 02:03:51.590
<v Speaker 3>hair or somebody who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who kind of leads that sort of thing.</v>

3149
02:03:51.610 --> 02:03:52.443
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

3150
02:03:52.770 --> 02:03:53.603
<v Speaker 2>when Alex Jones is on here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people got to understand Alice </v>

3151
02:03:55.770 --> 02:03:56.603
<v Speaker 2>Jones way more after me getting him </v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk and stoned and have a talk about </v>

3152
02:03:59.011 --> 02:04:01.830
<v Speaker 2>interdimensional child molesters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you get to see a chair like,</v>

3153
02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:06.860
<v Speaker 2>oh this is kind of like half wacky show </v>
<v Speaker 2>or he's also commenting on the craziness</v>

3154
02:04:07.471 --> 02:04:10.080
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you got to see who he really is.</v>

3155
02:04:10.081 --> 02:04:10.914
<v Speaker 2>What I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy that I've known for almost 20 </v>

3156
02:04:12.091 --> 02:04:13.920
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's what I wanted to do.</v>

3157
02:04:13.921 --> 02:04:15.210
<v Speaker 2>By having them on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people are like,</v>

3158
02:04:15.211 --> 02:04:16.260
<v Speaker 2>why are you friends with that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3159
02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:18.450
<v Speaker 2>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch what happens.</v>

3160
02:04:18.451 --> 02:04:20.370
<v Speaker 2>We'll get them fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have some fun.</v>

3161
02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:22.020
<v Speaker 2>And you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3162
02:04:22.021 --> 02:04:23.910
<v Speaker 2>this guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of wacky.</v>

3163
02:04:23.911 --> 02:04:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Like half of what he's doing is almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a show.</v>

3164
02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:27.383
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's like isn't it is and that's </v>

3165
02:04:30.361 --> 02:04:31.194
<v Speaker 2>kind of him.</v>

3166
02:04:31.350 --> 02:04:33.570
<v Speaker 3>People are buying into that,</v>

3167
02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:36.950
<v Speaker 2>but what are they buying into that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>false and what are they buying into?</v>

3168
02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:37.793
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately a lot of what Alex Jones </v>

3169
02:04:40.501 --> 02:04:42.990
<v Speaker 2>has been presenting over these years is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually true.</v>

3170
02:04:43.860 --> 02:04:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Like agent provocateurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when they have peaceful protest,</v>

3171
02:04:47.461 --> 02:04:48.294
<v Speaker 2>they'll send in people to smash windows </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're wearing government issue </v>

3172
02:04:50.911 --> 02:04:51.744
<v Speaker 2>boots and they get rounded up and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't wind up being prosecuted because </v>

3173
02:04:55.261 --> 02:04:58.980
<v Speaker 2>they were literally brought in by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>police to turn a peaceful protest into a</v>

3174
02:04:58.981 --> 02:04:59.814
<v Speaker 2>violent protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the people that took over occupy </v>

3175
02:05:02.611 --> 02:05:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street and undercover cops that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were doing all this fucking crazy,</v>

3176
02:05:07.171 --> 02:05:08.004
<v Speaker 2>chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>violent shit to get people to move in </v>

3177
02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:14.430
<v Speaker 2>and break up these camps and break up </v>
<v Speaker 2>these protests when they were all legal.</v>

3178
02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones sort of expose all that</v>

3179
02:05:16.350 --> 02:05:18.990
<v Speaker 1>first puts his support and I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

3180
02:05:19.110 --> 02:05:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't want to be in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

3181
02:05:20.770 --> 02:05:22.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to be controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly.</v>

3182
02:05:22.621 --> 02:05:23.431
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3183
02:05:23.431 --> 02:05:24.264
<v Speaker 1>it's all conversation expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he puts his support behind people </v>

3184
02:05:26.971 --> 02:05:27.804
<v Speaker 1>like Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is actually pushing these sorts of </v>

3185
02:05:29.731 --> 02:05:34.080
<v Speaker 1>agendas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sorts of the anti protesting,</v>

3186
02:05:34.081 --> 02:05:34.914
<v Speaker 1>like trying to change the law so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can run over protesters when there </v>

3187
02:05:36.940 --> 02:05:37.773
<v Speaker 1>peacefully protest and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that he's changing the </v>

3188
02:05:39.841 --> 02:05:41.190
<v Speaker 1>laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these things are coming up.</v>

3189
02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:42.770
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something a,</v>

3190
02:05:42.771 --> 02:05:45.150
<v Speaker 1>it's Wisconsin or Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something like that.</v>

3191
02:05:45.151 --> 02:05:48.660
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to put a thing in two </v>
<v Speaker 1>states at whatever it is.</v>

3192
02:05:48.690 --> 02:05:49.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know and I,</v>

3193
02:05:49.501 --> 02:05:50.334
<v Speaker 1>I'm so bad because when I follow my </v>
<v Speaker 1>train of thought and I can never have </v>

3194
02:05:52.651 --> 02:05:53.484
<v Speaker 1>citations and it drives me bananas </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't want to present </v>

3195
02:05:55.051 --> 02:05:56.850
<v Speaker 1>information as speculation.</v>

3196
02:05:57.840 --> 02:06:01.180
<v Speaker 2>The people are trying to stop people </v>
<v Speaker 2>from violating other people's rights.</v>

3197
02:06:01.250 --> 02:06:02.083
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is a person's right to drive a car </v>

3198
02:06:03.621 --> 02:06:04.454
<v Speaker 1>down the street more important than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person's right to express themselves by </v>

3199
02:06:06.591 --> 02:06:09.140
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want this to happen.</v>

3200
02:06:09.141 --> 02:06:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I am willfully challenging the law right</v>
<v Speaker 1>here in a peaceful way,</v>

3201
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:14.663
<v Speaker 2>but it's not peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your GRANDPA's dying and you need to </v>

3202
02:06:16.501 --> 02:06:17.334
<v Speaker 2>get to the hospital and some asshole </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to stand in front of him with a </v>

3203
02:06:18.871 --> 02:06:20.430
<v Speaker 2>macrame hat on with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3204
02:06:20.431 --> 02:06:21.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm a male feminist sign.</v>

3205
02:06:21.770 --> 02:06:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What instance are you quoting?</v>

3206
02:06:24.651 --> 02:06:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Split.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been talking about blocking people</v>

3207
02:06:26.571 --> 02:06:28.160
<v Speaker 1>on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't help anyone.</v>

3208
02:06:28.190 --> 02:06:29.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't help anybody.</v>

3209
02:06:29.121 --> 02:06:29.954
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been arrested for political </v>

3210
02:06:30.621 --> 02:06:31.454
<v Speaker 1>protests before and I was very aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was crossing a line on to here I was </v>

3211
02:06:35.091 --> 02:06:36.740
<v Speaker 1>doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to be arrested for it,</v>

3212
02:06:36.741 --> 02:06:37.574
<v Speaker 1>but it was the voices behind me and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>collective voices together that we're </v>

3213
02:06:40.551 --> 02:06:43.250
<v Speaker 1>doing something not knowing that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to be arrested.</v>

3214
02:06:43.251 --> 02:06:44.084
<v Speaker 1>Knowing that the part about going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail and being able to write about or </v>

3215
02:06:46.221 --> 02:06:48.890
<v Speaker 1>being able to understand that you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a stance on something.</v>

3216
02:06:48.891 --> 02:06:51.380
<v Speaker 1>You're just trying to bring attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you think is wrong.</v>

3217
02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were you arrested for?</v>

3218
02:06:52.460 --> 02:06:53.293
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was many years ago and all the </v>

3219
02:06:53.961 --> 02:06:56.390
<v Speaker 1>military guys already hate me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the school of the Americas.</v>

3220
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I was 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got arrested twice,</v>

3221
02:06:59.210 --> 02:07:01.020
<v Speaker 1>18 or 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3222
02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:02.510
<v Speaker 1>it was a school of the Americas when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

3223
02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:04.820
<v Speaker 1>they were teaching the counterinsurgency</v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques,</v>

3224
02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:06.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down at Fort Benning,</v>

3225
02:07:06.291 --> 02:07:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Georgia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm banned for life there,</v>

3226
02:07:08.450 --> 02:07:11.060
<v Speaker 1>but it was very religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I was very into social justice.</v>

3227
02:07:11.061 --> 02:07:11.894
<v Speaker 1>I was really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be a nun and I wanted to </v>

3228
02:07:13.281 --> 02:07:16.460
<v Speaker 1>change the world and I wanted people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not kill each other anymore.</v>

3229
02:07:16.670 --> 02:07:17.503
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted us not to fund a military </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups in South America who were </v>

3230
02:07:20.781 --> 02:07:24.050
<v Speaker 1>slaughtering people at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was protesting.</v>

3231
02:07:24.051 --> 02:07:26.510
<v Speaker 1>I was stepping deliberately onto a </v>
<v Speaker 1>military base and saying,</v>

3232
02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:28.100
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want this to happen anymore.</v>

3233
02:07:28.101 --> 02:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna go with you.</v>

3234
02:07:29.271 --> 02:07:30.320
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're arresting me.</v>

3235
02:07:30.321 --> 02:07:32.720
<v Speaker 1>I know my rights and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the soldiers.</v>

3236
02:07:32.810 --> 02:07:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Let's</v>

3237
02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:36.130
<v Speaker 2>unpack that because what you did there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

3238
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:39.340
<v Speaker 2>you made a up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a political protest.</v>

3239
02:07:39.370 --> 02:07:40.203
<v Speaker 2>You went to the scene of where you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>these terrible things are taking place </v>

3240
02:07:43.751 --> 02:07:44.584
<v Speaker 2>and you took a stand knowing you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get arrested and that it was </v>

3241
02:07:46.421 --> 02:07:48.240
<v Speaker 2>going to bring media attention to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

3242
02:07:48.610 --> 02:07:49.443
<v Speaker 2>There's a big difference between that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you deciding we're going to block </v>

3243
02:07:51.971 --> 02:07:54.280
<v Speaker 2>the one oh one because black lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>

3244
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:55.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't have anything to do with </v>

3245
02:07:56.441 --> 02:07:58.180
<v Speaker 2>all those people that were driving to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

3246
02:07:58.210 --> 02:08:01.870
<v Speaker 2>You're violating their rights to pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're violating their space.</v>

3247
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.823
<v Speaker 2>You're stopping them from being able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>move freely and a lot of them are </v>

3248
02:08:05.621 --> 02:08:06.454
<v Speaker 2>private deal of attention to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're doing it in a way that </v>

3249
02:08:08.891 --> 02:08:12.490
<v Speaker 2>inconveniences and puts people in danger</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not necessary.</v>

3250
02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:13.353
<v Speaker 2>You can do it in a public space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do it in places where you're </v>

3251
02:08:15.161 --> 02:08:15.994
<v Speaker 2>allowed to protest.</v>

3252
02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:16.833
<v Speaker 2>You can do it and you could still get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your voice out and still get your </v>

3253
02:08:19.541 --> 02:08:22.390
<v Speaker 2>message out and not block traffic on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>highway.</v>

3254
02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:23.433
<v Speaker 2>The blocking traffic on the highways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention horing and it's attention </v>

3255
02:08:25.841 --> 02:08:26.674
<v Speaker 2>whoring in a very dangerous way because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are stopping people from getting to </v>

3256
02:08:30.581 --> 02:08:31.414
<v Speaker 2>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're stopping people from getting </v>

3257
02:08:32.561 --> 02:08:33.394
<v Speaker 2>medical treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your people can be in the middle of </v>

3258
02:08:34.961 --> 02:08:37.270
<v Speaker 2>giving birth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of shit that happens.</v>

3259
02:08:37.271 --> 02:08:39.610
<v Speaker 2>We you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fuck with people's ability to travel</v>

3260
02:08:39.790 --> 02:08:41.500
<v Speaker 2>and move around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we rely on that.</v>

3261
02:08:41.501 --> 02:08:45.820
<v Speaker 2>It's extremely significant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you just decide that you know,</v>

3262
02:08:45.821 --> 02:08:46.720
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

3263
02:08:46.721 --> 02:08:48.730
<v Speaker 2>I want transgender rights for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathroom,</v>

3264
02:08:48.731 --> 02:08:49.564
<v Speaker 2>let's Bach this fucking highway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just because you think you can get </v>

3265
02:08:52.091 --> 02:08:55.030
<v Speaker 2>attention doing something like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.</v>

3266
02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:56.073
<v Speaker 2>There are ways to get attention doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are lawful and there's ways </v>

3267
02:08:58.571 --> 02:09:02.140
<v Speaker 2>that are noble and then there's blocking</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking highway like a baby.</v>

3268
02:09:02.210 --> 02:09:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Are they still working though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not just talking about the highway.</v>

3269
02:09:04.391 --> 02:09:07.880
<v Speaker 1>The are are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are bringing attention to things.</v>

3270
02:09:07.881 --> 02:09:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean is that still working the Dakota </v>
<v Speaker 1>pipeline and stuff like that when people</v>

3271
02:09:11.421 --> 02:09:13.970
<v Speaker 1>were protesting in a peaceful way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did it shut it down?</v>

3272
02:09:13.971 --> 02:09:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Shut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it just,</v>

3273
02:09:15.370 --> 02:09:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's bad for sas change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

3274
02:09:17.700 --> 02:09:19.670
<v Speaker 1>and I don't even know if that's the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>example of it.</v>

3275
02:09:19.690 --> 02:09:20.720
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm a good example</v>

3276
02:09:20.750 --> 02:09:23.690
<v Speaker 2>because it was peaceful protesting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it did get a lot of attention,</v>

3277
02:09:23.691 --> 02:09:25.700
<v Speaker 2>including me and a lot of other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who protest,</v>

3278
02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:26.573
<v Speaker 2>who tweeted about it and put a blinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and let people know about and </v>

3279
02:09:29.421 --> 02:09:31.130
<v Speaker 2>talked about it on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3280
02:09:31.131 --> 02:09:32.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean it does get attention</v>

3281
02:09:32.820 --> 02:09:37.140
<v Speaker 1>when the tower hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you're saying.</v>

3282
02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protesting.</v>

3283
02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:40.353
<v Speaker 1>They're disregarding what you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the highways and stuff like that </v>

3284
02:09:44.371 --> 02:09:45.204
<v Speaker 1>because that wouldn't be the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>protest that I would want it to be a </v>

3285
02:09:46.951 --> 02:09:48.600
<v Speaker 1>part of this not the kind of thing I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would want to enact.</v>

3286
02:09:48.810 --> 02:09:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Now did I believe in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I believe that the black lives matter</v>

3287
02:09:51.091 --> 02:09:51.511
<v Speaker 1>movement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3288
02:09:51.511 --> 02:09:52.344
<v Speaker 1>to a certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also believe in police officer </v>

3289
02:09:54.661 --> 02:09:58.410
<v Speaker 1>training and better training for police </v>
<v Speaker 1>officers and those in situations of high</v>

3290
02:09:58.411 --> 02:09:59.244
<v Speaker 1>stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's so much nuance to </v>

3291
02:10:01.051 --> 02:10:01.884
<v Speaker 1>what's going on there and there's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much carried on and and the the highway </v>

3292
02:10:05.221 --> 02:10:07.440
<v Speaker 1>blocking and the stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're giving very,</v>

3293
02:10:07.441 --> 02:10:11.310
<v Speaker 1>very good counter arguments to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this,</v>

3294
02:10:11.311 --> 02:10:12.144
<v Speaker 1>but I will say that there's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in effect when you can make </v>

3295
02:10:15.151 --> 02:10:19.770
<v Speaker 1>the loudest noise and you know something</v>
<v Speaker 1>is wrong,</v>

3296
02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:20.933
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your responsibility to try and fix </v>

3297
02:10:21.961 --> 02:10:23.940
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not by stopping the highway.</v>

3298
02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not.</v>

3299
02:10:25.591 --> 02:10:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by stopping the highway,</v>

3300
02:10:26.911 --> 02:10:29.640
<v Speaker 1>but if people are so determined to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>against what you're saying,</v>

3301
02:10:29.820 --> 02:10:33.860
<v Speaker 1>there's so in rooted you people have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make noise in the strangest ways.</v>

3302
02:10:33.861 --> 02:10:34.830
<v Speaker 1>They have to do what</v>

3303
02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:35.783
<v Speaker 2>people are very self righteous and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that you have to listen to them </v>

3304
02:10:38.101 --> 02:10:39.470
<v Speaker 2>and you don't want to listen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3305
02:10:39.471 --> 02:10:42.090
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your right as an American to not have to</v>

3306
02:10:42.091 --> 02:10:45.300
<v Speaker 2>listen to someone's protest as much as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your right as an American,</v>

3307
02:10:45.301 --> 02:10:47.790
<v Speaker 2>a protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't force someone to listen to you</v>

3308
02:10:47.791 --> 02:10:48.624
<v Speaker 2>because you think you're right and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're doing by standing in </v>

3309
02:10:50.581 --> 02:10:52.590
<v Speaker 2>front of someone on the highway in </v>
<v Speaker 2>blocking their passage.</v>

3310
02:10:52.730 --> 02:10:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But getting beyond the highway thing,</v>

3311
02:10:54.561 --> 02:10:56.180
<v Speaker 1>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're bringing on,</v>

3312
02:10:56.181 --> 02:10:57.310
<v Speaker 1>did I have an issue with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3313
02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3314
02:10:57.810 --> 02:10:58.643
<v Speaker 2>We literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no problem with protesting I </v>

3315
02:10:59.881 --> 02:11:00.714
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're protesting on the </v>

3316
02:11:01.321 --> 02:11:03.670
<v Speaker 2>highway and you're blocking traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a cunt.</v>

3317
02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:05.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a shitty way to do it.</v>

3318
02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3319
02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:06.473
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot disagree with you to a certain </v>

3320
02:11:08.551 --> 02:11:09.384
<v Speaker 1>extent where it is a very inconvenient </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and it can be a dangerous thing </v>

3321
02:11:11.551 --> 02:11:14.700
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think any protesting should </v>
<v Speaker 1>endanger peoples lives at all.</v>

3322
02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:15.593
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't hate marathons too for the same </v>

3323
02:11:16.681 --> 02:11:18.430
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3324
02:11:18.431 --> 02:11:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Well I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes a lot of sense,</v>

3325
02:11:20.730 --> 02:11:23.740
<v Speaker 1>but at least those are scheduled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's um,</v>

3326
02:11:23.820 --> 02:11:27.170
<v Speaker 1>caused to be able to have the right to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to run somebody over and kill me.</v>

3327
02:11:27.180 --> 02:11:27.691
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3328
02:11:27.691 --> 02:11:30.480
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't think somebody's life is not worth</v>

3329
02:11:30.481 --> 02:11:31.314
<v Speaker 1>something because they're expressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in a way that you disagree </v>

3330
02:11:33.361 --> 02:11:33.630
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

3331
02:11:33.630 --> 02:11:35.910
<v Speaker 2>Debra does not necessarily what the law </v>
<v Speaker 2>is saying.</v>

3332
02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:38.430
<v Speaker 2>No law saying that you exonerate someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

3333
02:11:38.431 --> 02:11:40.180
<v Speaker 2>If someone jumps in front of your car </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tries to stop,</v>

3334
02:11:40.690 --> 02:11:44.580
<v Speaker 2>we've seen he breaks off and smashed </v>
<v Speaker 2>their car windows because they're trying</v>

3335
02:11:44.581 --> 02:11:45.414
<v Speaker 2>to get through some sort of a protest </v>
<v Speaker 2>line and they don't have anything to do </v>

3336
02:11:47.311 --> 02:11:49.340
<v Speaker 2>with what the protest is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want to get out of there.</v>

3337
02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:50.413
<v Speaker 2>I'm in their car and their stock and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they have their kid with them and </v>

3338
02:11:52.171 --> 02:11:54.300
<v Speaker 2>the kids crying and freaking out and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit the gas.</v>

3339
02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:55.573
<v Speaker 1>Incredibly detailed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an incredibly detailed example </v>

3340
02:12:00.471 --> 02:12:01.304
<v Speaker 1>of some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually have the reference </v>

3341
02:12:01.941 --> 02:12:03.650
<v Speaker 1>point to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a citation for this,</v>

3342
02:12:03.651 --> 02:12:04.484
<v Speaker 1>so I can't argue with you on any of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story that you're giving me because I </v>

3343
02:12:07.251 --> 02:12:10.550
<v Speaker 1>have no way of knowing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this incident,</v>

3344
02:12:10.551 --> 02:12:11.384
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that your speculation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct in in the sense that I think </v>

3345
02:12:14.271 --> 02:12:15.950
<v Speaker 1>that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be horrible.</v>

3346
02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:17.600
<v Speaker 1>That would be horrible to have people </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

3347
02:12:17.601 --> 02:12:19.850
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means more to me.</v>

3348
02:12:19.970 --> 02:12:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Then you're getting your kid to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sick kid to the hospital.</v>

3349
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:25.100
<v Speaker 1>I think absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that,</v>

3350
02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:26.113
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that anybody's life is </v>

3351
02:12:27.471 --> 02:12:29.180
<v Speaker 1>worth more than another person's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's also,</v>

3352
02:12:29.181 --> 02:12:31.820
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on where there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of misdirected rage and anger.</v>

3353
02:12:31.821 --> 02:12:33.170
<v Speaker 1>Like my friend was very angry.</v>

3354
02:12:33.260 --> 02:12:34.093
<v Speaker 2>My friend was at one of these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he was trying to get his car </v>

3355
02:12:35.751 --> 02:12:39.230
<v Speaker 2>through and they were all blocked and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped and people had crossed hands,</v>

3356
02:12:39.231 --> 02:12:40.064
<v Speaker 2>locked hands and blocked the highway and</v>
<v Speaker 2>some guy came up to his window and is </v>

3357
02:12:42.771 --> 02:12:44.660
<v Speaker 2>screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter,</v>

3358
02:12:44.810 --> 02:12:46.490
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming at his window.</v>

3359
02:12:46.491 --> 02:12:47.030
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3360
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:48.350
<v Speaker 2>I agree man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3361
02:12:48.410 --> 02:12:49.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm stuck in traffic.</v>

3362
02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:50.833
<v Speaker 2>Why are you yelling at me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing anything like you were </v>

3363
02:12:52.341 --> 02:12:55.550
<v Speaker 2>very angry right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like this white guy yelling at him,</v>

3364
02:12:55.551 --> 02:12:58.370
<v Speaker 2>another white guy and he's screaming </v>
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter at him.</v>

3365
02:12:58.371 --> 02:12:59.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3366
02:12:59.180 --> 02:13:02.360
<v Speaker 2>this is so misdirected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If my friend is a Democrat,</v>

3367
02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:04.340
<v Speaker 2>votes liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so,</v>

3368
02:13:04.610 --> 02:13:05.443
<v Speaker 2>so liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like down the board with a pretty much </v>

3369
02:13:06.621 --> 02:13:07.454
<v Speaker 2>everything and someone's screaming at </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and screaming at him like he has </v>

3370
02:13:09.531 --> 02:13:10.364
<v Speaker 2>done something wrong because this person</v>
<v Speaker 2>is misguided and misdirected rage and </v>

3371
02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:15.113
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a part of this whole mob </v>

3372
02:13:15.981 --> 02:13:17.270
<v Speaker 2>mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's together,</v>

3373
02:13:17.271 --> 02:13:18.104
<v Speaker 2>they're all chanting and yelling and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's getting excited and they </v>

3374
02:13:20.031 --> 02:13:21.410
<v Speaker 2>think that they're doing the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3375
02:13:21.411 --> 02:13:24.500
<v Speaker 2>And these kids today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them that are involved in these</v>

3376
02:13:24.501 --> 02:13:25.334
<v Speaker 2>protests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so enamored by this idea that </v>

3377
02:13:27.201 --> 02:13:29.420
<v Speaker 2>they're doing the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're enacting change.</v>

3378
02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:32.160
<v Speaker 2>They don't realize that they're also </v>
<v Speaker 2>polarizing</v>

3379
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:32.993
<v Speaker 5>the opposition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is one of the reasons why </v>

3380
02:13:34.171 --> 02:13:35.004
<v Speaker 5>Donald Trump was elected in the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>place because so many people are so </v>

3381
02:13:37.021 --> 02:13:41.670
<v Speaker 5>tired of people shoving in their phase,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're righteous indignation shoving in</v>

3382
02:13:41.671 --> 02:13:42.504
<v Speaker 5>their face is locking hands and blocking</v>
<v Speaker 5>the highway and you have to listen to </v>

3383
02:13:45.001 --> 02:13:47.910
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is energy and it goes like this.</v>

3384
02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:50.100
<v Speaker 5>And then when it goes like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people go like that.</v>

3385
02:13:50.130 --> 02:13:51.990
<v Speaker 5>It's in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a cycle.</v>

3386
02:13:52.020 --> 02:13:54.270
<v Speaker 5>And can you understand where the rage is</v>
<v Speaker 5>built up of?</v>

3387
02:13:54.271 --> 02:13:55.104
<v Speaker 5>People felt like they've been ignored </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they've been pushed back so hard </v>

3388
02:13:58.531 --> 02:13:59.364
<v Speaker 5>that they actually start exploding like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that and they get into these hives </v>

3389
02:14:01.291 --> 02:14:02.940
<v Speaker 5>because they have no other group to </v>
<v Speaker 5>belong to.</v>

3390
02:14:03.330 --> 02:14:04.163
<v Speaker 5>There's definitely a way that you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>see that there's definitely a way that </v>

3391
02:14:07.861 --> 02:14:10.590
<v Speaker 5>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is the appropriate way to do things</v>

3392
02:14:10.591 --> 02:14:15.210
<v Speaker 5>then to continue to write,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to continue to talk,</v>

3393
02:14:15.211 --> 02:14:16.044
<v Speaker 5>to continue to express yourself in a way</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's going to make other people </v>

3394
02:14:19.621 --> 02:14:23.570
<v Speaker 5>consider what you're saying and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>change people's minds and thoughts and,</v>

3395
02:14:23.590 --> 02:14:25.980
<v Speaker 5>and it's not an instantaneous thing.</v>

3396
02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:28.560
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you put up a sign and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's fixed.</v>

3397
02:14:28.561 --> 02:14:31.350
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's take society that right.</v>

3398
02:14:31.370 --> 02:14:32.203
<v Speaker 5>But I think that's part of the rage of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people screaming as they want it to </v>

3399
02:14:34.141 --> 02:14:37.020
<v Speaker 5>change now and by going up to my </v>
<v Speaker 5>friend's window and yelling,</v>

3400
02:14:37.050 --> 02:14:40.250
<v Speaker 5>black lives matter this fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Head thinks he's going to change that,</v>

3401
02:14:40.251 --> 02:14:41.084
<v Speaker 5>but he doesn't even really think that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He thinks he's got the right to do it </v>

3402
02:14:43.261 --> 02:14:44.820
<v Speaker 5>and you've got to fucking listen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3403
02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:45.743
<v Speaker 5>There's this thing going on where people</v>
<v Speaker 5>get these mob mindsets where they think </v>

3404
02:14:49.621 --> 02:14:50.454
<v Speaker 5>they're allowed to hit a girl because </v>
<v Speaker 5>she's got a red hat on that says make </v>

3405
02:14:53.461 --> 02:14:55.770
<v Speaker 5>bitcoin great again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen that video?</v>

3406
02:14:55.980 --> 02:14:59.580
<v Speaker 5>That poor girl got maced in the face?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a joe cat.</v>

3407
02:14:59.620 --> 02:15:02.610
<v Speaker 5>They may stir in the fucking face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get that.</v>

3408
02:15:03.150 --> 02:15:04.920
<v Speaker 5>I get what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I am,</v>

3409
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:05.783
<v Speaker 5>I am on board with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the sentiment of what you're </v>

3410
02:15:08.011 --> 02:15:08.370
<v Speaker 5>saying.</v>

3411
02:15:08.370 --> 02:15:11.420
<v Speaker 5>I really do understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I also think there's such it,</v>

3412
02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:12.653
<v Speaker 5>a finger pointing going on and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>guilty of it on my twitter because I go </v>

3413
02:15:16.771 --> 02:15:19.210
<v Speaker 5>after these fuckheads all the tie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They call it [inaudible].</v>

3414
02:15:19.230 --> 02:15:20.370
<v Speaker 5>You fell it Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I say,</v>

3415
02:15:20.371 --> 02:15:21.450
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck Donald Trump.</v>

3416
02:15:21.451 --> 02:15:22.284
<v Speaker 5>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that person is not qualified to be </v>

3417
02:15:23.251 --> 02:15:24.720
<v Speaker 5>president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well is bad too.</v>

3418
02:15:24.721 --> 02:15:25.381
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not,</v>

3419
02:15:25.381 --> 02:15:26.850
<v Speaker 5>I didn't say anything about him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

3420
02:15:26.851 --> 02:15:30.330
<v Speaker 5>this person in office is not qualified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He should step down.</v>

3421
02:15:30.770 --> 02:15:32.080
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I am.</v>

3422
02:15:32.081 --> 02:15:34.380
<v Speaker 5>Can I really wanted to be president?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3423
02:15:34.381 --> 02:15:35.660
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he wanted to be president </v>
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>

3424
02:15:36.070 --> 02:15:37.380
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3425
02:15:37.390 --> 02:15:39.810
<v Speaker 5>I think he's terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He is a scared,</v>

3426
02:15:39.811 --> 02:15:42.300
<v Speaker 5>terrified little man up there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he's not terrified.</v>

3427
02:15:42.301 --> 02:15:43.890
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he,</v>

3428
02:15:43.891 --> 02:15:46.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he wanted to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just sort of happened.</v>

3429
02:15:46.530 --> 02:15:47.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

3430
02:15:47.310 --> 02:15:49.140
<v Speaker 5>I think he didn't think it through.</v>

3431
02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:51.360
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's when we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about not thinking it through.</v>

3432
02:15:51.361 --> 02:15:53.520
<v Speaker 5>I think the guy screaming at your friend</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the window,</v>

3433
02:15:53.521 --> 02:15:55.290
<v Speaker 5>he's not thinking it through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's caught on to something.</v>

3434
02:15:55.291 --> 02:15:57.240
<v Speaker 5>He's caught up in a wave of some pen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do it.</v>

3435
02:15:57.241 --> 02:15:58.650
<v Speaker 5>There's a million other people behind </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

3436
02:15:58.651 --> 02:16:00.780
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's looking at my friend,</v>

3437
02:16:00.781 --> 02:16:01.614
<v Speaker 5>my friend's vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my friends below him cause he's seated </v>

3438
02:16:03.690 --> 02:16:05.670
<v Speaker 5>and he's just screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Black lives matter.</v>

3439
02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:07.210
<v Speaker 5>Black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3440
02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:10.200
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's that bullshit.</v>

3441
02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:11.093
<v Speaker 5>But it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's awesome that twitter generation </v>

3442
02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:15.660
<v Speaker 5>protesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's also,</v>

3443
02:16:15.661 --> 02:16:16.494
<v Speaker 5>we have learned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so hard to just generalize and say </v>

3444
02:16:19.921 --> 02:16:21.900
<v Speaker 5>everything is because of this and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything is because of that,</v>

3445
02:16:21.901 --> 02:16:22.734
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything has to come from an </v>

3446
02:16:24.541 --> 02:16:27.090
<v Speaker 5>individual place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And at the same time we're all trying to</v>

3447
02:16:27.091 --> 02:16:27.924
<v Speaker 5>belong to communities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're all trying to belong to something </v>

3448
02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:30.190
<v Speaker 5>we believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3449
02:16:30.270 --> 02:16:31.810
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're latching onto that.</v>

3450
02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:34.370
<v Speaker 1>And then I think that the sins that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>in to the sins that we,</v>

3451
02:16:34.380 --> 02:16:36.220
<v Speaker 1>whatever then that happened along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

3452
02:16:36.221 --> 02:16:37.780
<v Speaker 1>the missteps that happened along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

3453
02:16:37.781 --> 02:16:39.730
<v Speaker 1>we tend to forgive them instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing out,</v>

3454
02:16:39.731 --> 02:16:41.860
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't do this.</v>

3455
02:16:41.861 --> 02:16:45.100
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't affect somebody who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving their child to work or something</v>

3456
02:16:45.101 --> 02:16:46.810
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's not what should happen.</v>

3457
02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:49.900
<v Speaker 1>But we do tend to forgive the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in the same team as us.</v>

3458
02:16:49.901 --> 02:16:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Don't wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

3459
02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:53.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the the make America </v>
<v Speaker 1>great fuckers.</v>

3460
02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:54.701
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3461
02:16:54.701 --> 02:16:56.040
<v Speaker 1>well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do all that.</v>

3462
02:16:56.350 --> 02:16:57.183
<v Speaker 1>They can't see their team lose and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll defend him now to the death of </v>

3463
02:16:59.801 --> 02:17:01.300
<v Speaker 1>defend his decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does something wrong.</v>

3464
02:17:01.301 --> 02:17:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't understand how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you like?</v>

3465
02:17:03.030 --> 02:17:03.863
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually had to understand how it </v>

3466
02:17:04.511 --> 02:17:05.344
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This person is not supposed to be in </v>

3467
02:17:06.181 --> 02:17:07.014
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This person's not supposed to represent </v>

3468
02:17:07.991 --> 02:17:08.824
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an and and he is and he's not </v>

3469
02:17:11.590 --> 02:17:12.423
<v Speaker 1>who I want the world to see America as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're a great country and we </v>

3470
02:17:14.830 --> 02:17:15.550
<v Speaker 1>fuck up a lot.</v>

3471
02:17:15.550 --> 02:17:19.300
<v Speaker 2>There's also a problem when having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>popularity contest to decide who gets to</v>

3472
02:17:19.301 --> 02:17:21.310
<v Speaker 2>run things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if they had a popularity contest</v>

3473
02:17:21.311 --> 02:17:23.500
<v Speaker 2>to get to see who's the dean of Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3474
02:17:23.650 --> 02:17:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the character going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>this year?</v>

3475
02:17:25.211 --> 02:17:26.044
<v Speaker 2>The curriculum is going to be</v>

3476
02:17:26.060 --> 02:17:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

3477
02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One will.</v>

3478
02:17:28.820 --> 02:17:30.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening right now.</v>

3479
02:17:30.681 --> 02:17:31.720
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do away with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3480
02:17:31.790 --> 02:17:32.623
<v Speaker 1>the public's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the vouchers and the shit that's </v>

3481
02:17:33.861 --> 02:17:34.694
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weird shit going on </v>

3482
02:17:35.781 --> 02:17:37.940
<v Speaker 1>that jeff sessions guy scares her shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he wants to bring back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just say no.</v>

3484
02:17:39.590 --> 02:17:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Must bring back to 19 he's just saying,</v>

3485
02:17:42.170 --> 02:17:43.003
<v Speaker 1>he just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the marijuana has the same negative </v>

3486
02:17:44.721 --> 02:17:47.810
<v Speaker 1>effects as heroin language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slightly less bad than heroin.</v>

3487
02:17:47.811 --> 02:17:49.790
<v Speaker 1>What the Hell Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like child,</v>

3488
02:17:50.450 --> 02:17:53.720
<v Speaker 1>an old child and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3489
02:17:53.721 --> 02:17:54.501
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3490
02:17:54.501 --> 02:17:55.251
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3491
02:17:55.251 --> 02:17:56.084
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3492
02:17:56.330 --> 02:17:59.540
<v Speaker 1>cause I get worked up thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people in power and I got it.</v>

3493
02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:02.140
<v Speaker 2>As you get worked out and people get </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked up rather,</v>

3494
02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:04.870
<v Speaker 2>and they start talking about it and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>also realize that,</v>

3495
02:18:04.871 --> 02:18:07.030
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really does matter if you vote,</v>

3496
02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:08.820
<v Speaker 2>it really does matter if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically active,</v>

3497
02:18:08.821 --> 02:18:09.654
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really doesn't matter if you talk </v>

3498
02:18:10.091 --> 02:18:13.570
<v Speaker 2>about these things that you care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the team mentality that we have,</v>

3499
02:18:13.571 --> 02:18:15.970
<v Speaker 2>the US versus them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just gets so weird.</v>

3500
02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:19.540
<v Speaker 2>It gets so fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get so out of control with it and</v>

3501
02:18:19.541 --> 02:18:20.470
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

3502
02:18:20.471 --> 02:18:21.304
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that make America great </v>

3503
02:18:21.911 --> 02:18:22.744
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people they don't want to hear shit </v>

3504
02:18:23.591 --> 02:18:26.140
<v Speaker 2>about the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to shit about Bernie.</v>

3505
02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:30.490
<v Speaker 2>They want to say Barack Obama is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim and from fucking Kenya,</v>

3506
02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:34.570
<v Speaker 1>and I'm guilty of not wanting to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>good things about Donald Trump.</v>

3507
02:18:34.750 --> 02:18:36.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

3508
02:18:36.790 --> 02:18:39.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care because I see so much.</v>

3509
02:18:40.300 --> 02:18:41.133
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like there's so much that's </v>

3510
02:18:41.741 --> 02:18:42.574
<v Speaker 1>working against human achievement with </v>
<v Speaker 1>him being in power and the people he's </v>

3511
02:18:44.471 --> 02:18:45.304
<v Speaker 1>appointing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Empower</v>

3512
02:18:46.010 --> 02:18:48.160
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it gives people goal.</v>

3513
02:18:48.580 --> 02:18:49.413
<v Speaker 2>I think it gives people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think without opposition it's very </v>

3514
02:18:52.661 --> 02:18:53.494
<v Speaker 2>difficult to get motivated and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a significant amount of </v>

3515
02:18:56.411 --> 02:18:59.890
<v Speaker 2>opposition now and people were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're organizing people on the</v>

3516
02:18:59.891 --> 02:19:03.400
<v Speaker 2>left are organizing in a way that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>never had before and hopefully hopefully</v>

3517
02:19:03.610 --> 02:19:04.443
<v Speaker 2>people will understand that there'll be </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone along the line that understands </v>

3518
02:19:07.511 --> 02:19:11.140
<v Speaker 2>that the polarization effect that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens between choosing these hard line</v>

3519
02:19:11.141 --> 02:19:11.974
<v Speaker 2>teams left and right and not recognizing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the possibility that there's so many </v>

3520
02:19:15.251 --> 02:19:17.380
<v Speaker 2>people in the middle that just pick a </v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

3521
02:19:17.590 --> 02:19:19.210
<v Speaker 2>They just decided to go left or decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go.</v>

3522
02:19:19.211 --> 02:19:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they could be on either side,</v>

3523
02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:23.920
<v Speaker 2>but both of them are unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of them are unrealistic.</v>

3524
02:19:23.950 --> 02:19:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3525
02:19:24.911 --> 02:19:25.744
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton was a terrible </v>

3526
02:19:26.531 --> 02:19:28.190
<v Speaker 2>candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was a terrible opposition</v>

3527
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:29.023
<v Speaker 1>candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully next time they'll be someone </v>

3528
02:19:29.961 --> 02:19:30.794
<v Speaker 1>that's really good and will understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the problem with having a </v>

3529
02:19:33.411 --> 02:19:38.120
<v Speaker 1>medical maniacal egomaniac who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking a business vulture run,</v>

3530
02:19:38.121 --> 02:19:40.160
<v Speaker 1>run the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which happened.</v>

3531
02:19:40.190 --> 02:19:41.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was the choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This awareness,</v>

3532
02:19:43.130 --> 02:19:44.300
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

3533
02:19:44.301 --> 02:19:46.790
<v Speaker 1>she was more qualified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She served as secretary of the state.</v>

3534
02:19:46.970 --> 02:19:47.803
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like that she was a </v>

3535
02:19:48.501 --> 02:19:52.610
<v Speaker 1>professional politician because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a professional politician,</v>

3536
02:19:52.611 --> 02:19:55.190
<v Speaker 1>then you're dedicated to just winning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not,</v>

3537
02:19:55.580 --> 02:19:57.670
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't choose a higher,</v>

3538
02:19:57.770 --> 02:20:01.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think problems,</v>

3539
02:20:01.340 --> 02:20:04.190
<v Speaker 1>but who the fuck wants to be president?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other problem.</v>

3540
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Like who the people who want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>president don't understand.</v>

3541
02:20:08.331 --> 02:20:12.110
<v Speaker 1>It's the highest public service office </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can possibly do.</v>

3542
02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:13.273
<v Speaker 1>Like you're also going to shit on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole world's going to dump on your </v>

3543
02:20:16.311 --> 02:20:16.910
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3544
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:20.860
<v Speaker 1>And you have to act absolutely serve the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country later.</v>

3545
02:20:20.890 --> 02:20:21.723
<v Speaker 1>That's what I don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how anybody would </v>

3546
02:20:23.481 --> 02:20:24.314
<v Speaker 1>want to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to give that much of themselves </v>

3547
02:20:25.371 --> 02:20:27.590
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also can see how people would want</v>

3548
02:20:27.591 --> 02:20:29.300
<v Speaker 1>to aspire to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to serve the country,</v>

3549
02:20:29.301 --> 02:20:31.090
<v Speaker 1>not lead the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serve the country.</v>

3550
02:20:31.870 --> 02:20:33.350
<v Speaker 1>That's where I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lose my shit.</v>

3551
02:20:33.351 --> 02:20:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Like honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many of my friends I have,</v>

3552
02:20:37.490 --> 02:20:38.323
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to express this to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I can't have conversations with </v>

3553
02:20:39.981 --> 02:20:40.814
<v Speaker 1>them on twitter anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to talk to them via text like I </v>

3554
02:20:43.821 --> 02:20:46.080
<v Speaker 1>can because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people jump into my car,</v>

3555
02:20:46.081 --> 02:20:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3556
02:20:47.371 --> 02:20:48.204
<v Speaker 1>and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got so many rape threats during this </v>

3557
02:20:50.060 --> 02:20:52.640
<v Speaker 1>fucking election because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

3558
02:20:52.641 --> 02:20:53.474
<v Speaker 1>it was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just to the point where she was </v>

3559
02:20:54.801 --> 02:20:55.131
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3560
02:20:55.131 --> 02:20:57.230
<v Speaker 1>I can't speak with this person who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing with me,</v>

3561
02:20:57.231 --> 02:20:59.780
<v Speaker 1>even though they're my friend and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>not unfriending them not,</v>

3562
02:20:59.840 --> 02:21:00.920
<v Speaker 1>not being their friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

3563
02:21:00.921 --> 02:21:01.754
<v Speaker 1>you have to talk to me one on one </v>
<v Speaker 1>because so many people were just coming </v>

3564
02:21:03.861 --> 02:21:07.490
<v Speaker 1>at me and he's having a conversation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a mall and people just walk by and start</v>

3565
02:21:07.491 --> 02:21:08.324
<v Speaker 1>yelling at you.</v>

3566
02:21:10.430 --> 02:21:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

3567
02:21:13.130 --> 02:21:14.230
<v Speaker 1>I know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with that?</v>

3568
02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:17.750
<v Speaker 1>And I'm okay with understanding like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of,</v>

3569
02:21:18.170 --> 02:21:20.660
<v Speaker 1>I guess that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an assault,</v>

3570
02:21:20.661 --> 02:21:22.460
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a word indicating.</v>

3571
02:21:22.490 --> 02:21:23.323
<v Speaker 1>So I meant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been not a public figure </v>

3572
02:21:25.161 --> 02:21:25.994
<v Speaker 1>necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've had people talk shit about me </v>

3573
02:21:27.591 --> 02:21:28.424
<v Speaker 1>to my face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk Shit about me here and there </v>

3574
02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:31.130
<v Speaker 1>because of my previous group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

3575
02:21:31.131 --> 02:21:34.040
<v Speaker 1>in mma you get a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just telling you how terrible you</v>

3576
02:21:34.041 --> 02:21:35.630
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] to a certain extent,</v>

3577
02:21:35.660 --> 02:21:36.530
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

3578
02:21:36.531 --> 02:21:38.780
<v Speaker 1>you want to be desensitized to somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>to threatening to rape you.</v>

3579
02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:41.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be deceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never want that to be,</v>

3580
02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:43.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible thing.</v>

3581
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:47.270
<v Speaker 1>So fucking easy to say something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just type it out,</v>

3582
02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:51.130
<v Speaker 1>try to get them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get Julie's fucking go and yeah,</v>

3583
02:21:51.220 --> 02:21:53.810
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I'm looking for a fight,</v>

3584
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I jumped right on it because I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight him,</v>

3585
02:21:56.540 --> 02:21:57.350
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3586
02:21:57.350 --> 02:22:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want to do that though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Miss Combat.</v>

3587
02:22:02.040 --> 02:22:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I miss arguing with people.</v>

3588
02:22:03.891 --> 02:22:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like arguing with my fists or argue.</v>

3589
02:22:05.751 --> 02:22:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I Miss Combat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do miss that.</v>

3590
02:22:07.031 --> 02:22:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Like I thought about like maybe entering</v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling competitions might,</v>

3591
02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:12.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that I actually,</v>

3592
02:22:12.561 --> 02:22:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Iowa hasn't really good Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu club and I went there once and I</v>

3593
02:22:15.861 --> 02:22:17.420
<v Speaker 1>had a great time rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I just,</v>

3594
02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is about the way my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentality works,</v>

3595
02:22:21.081 --> 02:22:23.210
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like it would distract me </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from my writing.</v>

3596
02:22:23.211 --> 02:22:25.680
<v Speaker 1>And I know I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it would probably be balancing me</v>

3597
02:22:25.710 --> 02:22:26.543
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I get so intense about the things </v>

3598
02:22:28.381 --> 02:22:29.214
<v Speaker 1>that I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a list of questions for you </v>

3599
02:22:30.751 --> 02:22:33.810
<v Speaker 1>today just because I wanted to find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you think about certain things like</v>

3600
02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:34.950
<v Speaker 1>as you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3601
02:22:34.980 --> 02:22:37.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I narrow minded maybe as a thing for it,</v>

3602
02:22:37.561 --> 02:22:38.394
<v Speaker 1>but I just get so obsessed about getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>answers to certain things or asking </v>

3603
02:22:41.641 --> 02:22:42.410
<v Speaker 1>questions about things.</v>

3604
02:22:42.410 --> 02:22:43.243
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm afraid I'd do that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling and Jujitsu and I would get </v>

3605
02:22:45.601 --> 02:22:49.980
<v Speaker 1>too far into that and not address the </v>
<v Speaker 1>new direction that my life needs to take</v>

3606
02:22:50.760 --> 02:22:52.970
<v Speaker 1>a lot like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3607
02:22:53.250 --> 02:22:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm a terrible standup comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>

3608
02:22:55.220 --> 02:22:56.910
<v Speaker 1>you're nothing like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're good.</v>

3609
02:22:57.880 --> 02:23:01.770
<v Speaker 1>You're a need to like get completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbed and it's,</v>

3610
02:23:02.430 --> 02:23:04.860
<v Speaker 1>and then you're worried about being </v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbed and other things.</v>

3611
02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:06.180
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

3612
02:23:06.181 --> 02:23:07.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3613
02:23:07.050 --> 02:23:10.550
<v Speaker 1>I got sort of diagnosed when I went </v>
<v Speaker 1>through my depression spelling.</v>

3614
02:23:10.610 --> 02:23:11.790
<v Speaker 1>I'd been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd had depression before,</v>

3615
02:23:11.791 --> 02:23:13.620
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>post fight depression was pretty rough.</v>

3616
02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:14.880
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3617
02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:15.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on this,</v>

3618
02:23:15.931 --> 02:23:20.220
<v Speaker 1>I was on that and my body was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting all weird and um,</v>

3619
02:23:20.580 --> 02:23:21.413
<v Speaker 1>they said that I have real attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>deficit disorder problems and still </v>

3620
02:23:23.521 --> 02:23:26.490
<v Speaker 1>going through the testing for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they did give me adderall,</v>

3621
02:23:26.491 --> 02:23:27.750
<v Speaker 1>which is amazing.</v>

3622
02:23:29.790 --> 02:23:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

3623
02:23:31.830 --> 02:23:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3624
02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:35.430
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like it calmed me down so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

3625
02:23:35.431 --> 02:23:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I was so calm and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3626
02:23:37.141 --> 02:23:38.820
<v Speaker 1>we're all calmed you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3627
02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:41.850
<v Speaker 1>That's what they say about the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have adhd.</v>

3628
02:23:42.970 --> 02:23:43.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3629
02:23:43.811 --> 02:23:45.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this makes a lot more sense.</v>

3630
02:23:45.331 --> 02:23:47.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm not looking at 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>things at once.</v>

3631
02:23:47.071 --> 02:23:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3632
02:23:47.850 --> 02:23:49.690
<v Speaker 1>cause I couldn't run a 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>things at once.</v>

3633
02:23:50.910 --> 02:23:51.743
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something I did talk to my </v>

3634
02:23:54.121 --> 02:23:54.954
<v Speaker 1>therapist and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to lose creativity this </v>

<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't matter.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3660
02:24:54.841 --> 02:24:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Now you know like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3661
02:24:56.550 --> 02:24:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm sure that's something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would keep you up at night.</v>

3662
02:24:58.980 --> 02:25:03.330
<v Speaker 1>What does a woman that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I'm talking about this,</v>

3663
02:25:03.331 --> 02:25:04.680
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

3664
02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:05.620
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3665
02:25:05.621 --> 02:25:07.680
<v Speaker 1>it's real life and real bodies and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3666
02:25:07.690 --> 02:25:08.523
<v Speaker 1>people go through things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And antidepressants really messed me up </v>

3667
02:25:11.010 --> 02:25:12.620
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for men as well.</v>

3668
02:25:12.750 --> 02:25:13.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3669
02:25:13.201 --> 02:25:14.940
<v Speaker 1>it was tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was needed.</v>

3670
02:25:15.270 --> 02:25:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

3671
02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:19.073
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to hurt myself anymore and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that I was going down a path </v>

3672
02:25:22.561 --> 02:25:25.220
<v Speaker 1>where I was going be hurting myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

3673
02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:27.310
<v Speaker 1>with your decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the mindset,</v>

3674
02:25:27.530 --> 02:25:28.363
<v Speaker 1>just physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have a history of eating </v>

3675
02:25:29.951 --> 02:25:30.784
<v Speaker 1>disorders and doing things and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see myself slipping into that </v>

3676
02:25:33.191 --> 02:25:36.460
<v Speaker 1>path again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was like leaving,</v>

3677
02:25:36.461 --> 02:25:40.570
<v Speaker 1>fighting and then discovering that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually really want to explore this new</v>

3678
02:25:40.660 --> 02:25:41.493
<v Speaker 1>area of fighting that is writing or this</v>
<v Speaker 1>new area of creativity that is writing </v>

3679
02:25:43.871 --> 02:25:46.630
<v Speaker 1>that you can bring fighting into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

3680
02:25:46.690 --> 02:25:47.523
<v Speaker 1>I needed all of these kinds of things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be laid out and I thought I probably </v>

3681
02:25:49.661 --> 02:25:50.494
<v Speaker 1>would have interrupted myself if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't gone on antidepressants and I </v>

3682
02:25:52.961 --> 02:25:57.370
<v Speaker 1>hadn't kind of pulled back a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>from feeling everything so intensely.</v>

3683
02:25:57.440 --> 02:25:59.420
<v Speaker 2>And were you worried that you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>worthy?</v>

3684
02:25:59.460 --> 02:26:02.070
<v Speaker 2>The adderall was going to invade your </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative thoughts.</v>

3685
02:26:02.071 --> 02:26:02.570
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

3686
02:26:02.570 --> 02:26:04.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried about that now.</v>

3687
02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm still being tech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put me on it,</v>

3688
02:26:05.751 --> 02:26:07.610
<v Speaker 1>but they said we have to go through all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this testing for it.</v>

3689
02:26:07.611 --> 02:26:08.444
<v Speaker 1>So I'm still being tested for if I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention deficit disorder or what or </v>

3690
02:26:11.901 --> 02:26:13.500
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3691
02:26:13.580 --> 02:26:17.390
<v Speaker 1>that makes me think in a peculiar way or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not be able to get tasks finished.</v>

3692
02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:18.691
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3693
02:26:18.691 --> 02:26:19.250
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

3694
02:26:19.250 --> 02:26:20.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm still being tested for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3695
02:26:20.541 --> 02:26:21.374
<v Speaker 1>taking it now I am able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm able to calm down any ticket once a </v>

3696
02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:28.550
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it only lasts four hours.</v>

3697
02:26:28.551 --> 02:26:29.384
<v Speaker 1>So my doctor gave me an f for two a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only taken one today and it was </v>

3698
02:26:32.301 --> 02:26:33.134
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been drinking a shit load of </v>

3699
02:26:33.531 --> 02:26:34.364
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I took one like earlier this </v>

3700
02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:36.380
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was,</v>

3701
02:26:36.380 --> 02:26:38.150
<v Speaker 1>what does it do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the effect?</v>

3702
02:26:38.510 --> 02:26:42.590
<v Speaker 1>So if say I wake up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3703
02:26:42.591 --> 02:26:45.680
<v Speaker 1>in my room and I look and it's messy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my room,</v>

3704
02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:49.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I tend to do or my tendency to do,</v>

3705
02:26:49.491 --> 02:26:50.324
<v Speaker 1>especially post fighting whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we entered this weird mindspace is </v>

3706
02:26:54.050 --> 02:26:57.140
<v Speaker 1>panic about this is messy here.</v>

3707
02:26:57.230 --> 02:26:59.570
<v Speaker 1>This being messy here means I won't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to complete this task,</v>

3708
02:26:59.700 --> 02:27:01.340
<v Speaker 1>this will happen here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this'll happen here.</v>

3709
02:27:01.341 --> 02:27:02.174
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm never going to meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I just get paralyzed and I </v>

3710
02:27:04.011 --> 02:27:04.844
<v Speaker 1>panic and I'm fearful that I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually just get out of bed to put a </v>

3711
02:27:07.761 --> 02:27:11.000
<v Speaker 1>shirt on or to pick something up because</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

3712
02:27:11.001 --> 02:27:13.640
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden clouds in at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3713
02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:17.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would lead me to hyperfocus on really</v>

3714
02:27:17.391 --> 02:27:18.224
<v Speaker 1>strange things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that actually helped with </v>

3715
02:27:20.481 --> 02:27:23.450
<v Speaker 1>fighting if that's what I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still in the diagnosis,</v>

3716
02:27:23.451 --> 02:27:25.250
<v Speaker 1>like process of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3717
02:27:25.251 --> 02:27:27.260
<v Speaker 1>so far this is the medicine that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked the best for me.</v>

3718
02:27:27.261 --> 02:27:28.370
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3719
02:27:28.460 --> 02:27:29.840
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was fighting,</v>

3720
02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:30.913
<v Speaker 1>one thing that I did do poorly was I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would go from a to c instead of go to a </v>

3721
02:27:33.561 --> 02:27:34.394
<v Speaker 1>to b to c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would see what would happen after I </v>

3722
02:27:35.871 --> 02:27:36.530
<v Speaker 1>won the fight.</v>

3723
02:27:36.530 --> 02:27:39.320
<v Speaker 1>In my mind when I first started training</v>
<v Speaker 1>camp,</v>

3724
02:27:39.321 --> 02:27:41.270
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of fighters do and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that helps,</v>

3725
02:27:41.450 --> 02:27:42.283
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you miss b where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual fight happens and in my mind </v>

3726
02:27:45.291 --> 02:27:46.124
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I would gloss over that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would get caught up in things and I </v>

3727
02:27:48.291 --> 02:27:51.380
<v Speaker 1>would wait for this to happen and wait </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that time or be paralyzed and not be</v>

3728
02:27:51.381 --> 02:27:54.470
<v Speaker 1>able to make the next step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now I feel like I am able to,</v>

3729
02:27:54.471 --> 02:27:55.304
<v Speaker 1>when I take a pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm able to put my feet on the ground </v>

3730
02:27:59.630 --> 02:28:01.340
<v Speaker 1>out of bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look up and say,</v>

3731
02:28:01.341 --> 02:28:02.630
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my room needs to be cleaned,</v>

3732
02:28:02.631 --> 02:28:05.030
<v Speaker 1>but first I need to do this and I'm able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make,</v>

3733
02:28:05.031 --> 02:28:05.864
<v Speaker 1>I'm able to go to a to B and then do z </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of just jumping over and then </v>

3734
02:28:09.081 --> 02:28:09.914
<v Speaker 1>looking at sea and then thinking all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things after me just come crashing </v>

3735
02:28:11.541 --> 02:28:12.500
<v Speaker 1>at me and I freak out.</v>

3736
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Now you said earlier that post career I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started thinking about brain trauma.</v>

3737
02:28:18.570 --> 02:28:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started thinking about do you do what?</v>

3738
02:28:20.990 --> 02:28:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Like what thoughts specifically</v>

3739
02:28:23.180 --> 02:28:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I wondered about well the depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3740
02:28:25.770 --> 02:28:26.540
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3741
02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:28.370
<v Speaker 1>and I wonder about how many shots that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taken.</v>

3742
02:28:28.371 --> 02:28:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean they had a good chin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was rocked a lot in the gym.</v>

3743
02:28:30.921 --> 02:28:33.560
<v Speaker 1>I sparred a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

3744
02:28:33.860 --> 02:28:34.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I say,</v>

3745
02:28:34.631 --> 02:28:38.480
<v Speaker 1>I like back in the old days I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight whatever opportunity came my way.</v>

3746
02:28:38.481 --> 02:28:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Never took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

3747
02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:41.540
<v Speaker 1>didn't have ct scans till I got into </v>
<v Speaker 1>strike force,</v>

3748
02:28:41.541 --> 02:28:43.490
<v Speaker 1>which was late in my career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3749
02:28:43.510 --> 02:28:47.390
<v Speaker 1>or a ct or MRI,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot which one does what.</v>

3750
02:28:47.391 --> 02:28:52.040
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know how much of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dizziness that I have is like,</v>

3751
02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:54.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a little here,</v>

3752
02:28:54.141 --> 02:28:54.591
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

3753
02:28:54.591 --> 02:28:55.370
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3754
02:28:55.370 --> 02:28:56.203
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not like not finding my sunglasses </v>

3755
02:28:58.011 --> 02:29:00.770
<v Speaker 1>because were on the top of my head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering around looking for them.</v>

3756
02:29:00.970 --> 02:29:02.630
<v Speaker 1>And for a while there I was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>scared.</v>

3757
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is a post fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3758
02:29:04.610 --> 02:29:06.390
<v Speaker 1>brain trauma and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3759
02:29:06.391 --> 02:29:08.650
<v Speaker 1>and the depression set in pretty hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>post fight.</v>

3760
02:29:08.651 --> 02:29:09.500
<v Speaker 1>So I was wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3761
02:29:09.501 --> 02:29:10.760
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3762
02:29:10.761 --> 02:29:12.530
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and seeing doctors and stuff like that.</v>

3763
02:29:12.531 --> 02:29:13.364
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3764
02:29:13.850 --> 02:29:14.990
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

3765
02:29:14.991 --> 02:29:16.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should get an Mri,</v>

3766
02:29:16.101 --> 02:29:16.934
<v Speaker 1>maybe we shoot your brain checked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's also address the depression </v>

3767
02:29:18.981 --> 02:29:19.814
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once the depression was addressed </v>

3768
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:22.423
<v Speaker 1>and I was able to see that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else going on here that may </v>

3769
02:29:24.021 --> 02:29:25.460
<v Speaker 1>not be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3770
02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:26.773
<v Speaker 1>due to getting hit in the head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may actually be due to me having a </v>

3771
02:29:28.581 --> 02:29:29.414
<v Speaker 1>chemical thing that makes me just all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the place because I'm in the best </v>

3772
02:29:33.711 --> 02:29:35.090
<v Speaker 1>school in the world for writing right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3773
02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:39.050
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get in there like without I a </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to explain it.</v>

3774
02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:40.513
<v Speaker 1>The focus is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I just needed to channel it and </v>

3775
02:29:42.651 --> 02:29:46.100
<v Speaker 1>I think that I got very scared that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had brain damage,</v>

3776
02:29:46.130 --> 02:29:48.850
<v Speaker 1>that I was going to never be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything but I wasn't going to win.</v>

3777
02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:49.703
<v Speaker 1>And the truth was I think that my body </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemistry had changed somewhat and my </v>

3778
02:29:54.951 --> 02:29:57.590
<v Speaker 1>learning disassociated or my learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

3779
02:29:57.591 --> 02:30:01.220
<v Speaker 1>that that made me good at fighting had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to translate into a different world.</v>

3780
02:30:01.700 --> 02:30:02.533
<v Speaker 1>And so I had to kind of take steps to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and get into some pretty intense </v>

3781
02:30:04.971 --> 02:30:07.640
<v Speaker 1>therapy and do things like that in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand that no,</v>

3782
02:30:07.641 --> 02:30:11.010
<v Speaker 1>my brain is just wired differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a,</v>

3783
02:30:11.210 --> 02:30:14.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's the creative brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the obsessive rain or whatever.</v>

3784
02:30:15.350 --> 02:30:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3785
02:30:16.451 --> 02:30:17.284
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I sound like I'm talking bro </v>

3786
02:30:18.351 --> 02:30:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Science here because they really don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have my diagnosis sheet to show you from</v>

3787
02:30:22.071 --> 02:30:23.690
<v Speaker 1>an actual doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

3788
02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:24.713
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality of depression is that a </v>

3789
02:30:26.241 --> 02:30:28.910
<v Speaker 1>doctor can't really say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh hey look,</v>

3790
02:30:28.911 --> 02:30:29.990
<v Speaker 1>you've got herpes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

3791
02:30:29.991 --> 02:30:30.651
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3792
02:30:30.651 --> 02:30:31.040
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3793
02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:34.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's depression is some very,</v>

3794
02:30:34.641 --> 02:30:35.474
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to define and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>only know whether or not you have it </v>

3795
02:30:37.851 --> 02:30:40.040
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't like scan you and go,</v>

3796
02:30:40.041 --> 02:30:40.874
<v Speaker 1>oh Julia and depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can answer a whole bunch of </v>

3797
02:30:42.531 --> 02:30:43.140
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3798
02:30:43.140 --> 02:30:43.973
<v Speaker 1>Did they give you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can also lie if you know what </v>

3799
02:30:45.501 --> 02:30:46.334
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I did in many depression </v>

3800
02:30:47.781 --> 02:30:48.501
<v Speaker 1>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just lie,</v>

3801
02:30:48.501 --> 02:30:51.380
<v Speaker 1>cause I didn't want people to think I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had depression and it was just like,</v>

3802
02:30:51.381 --> 02:30:52.214
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am actually feeling this on this </v>

3803
02:30:53.751 --> 02:30:55.700
<v Speaker 1>survey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should answer this correctly.</v>

3804
02:30:56.240 --> 02:30:57.680
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will say that,</v>

3805
02:30:57.840 --> 02:30:59.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I did,</v>

3806
02:30:59.430 --> 02:31:00.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I look back at my lifetime of </v>

3807
02:31:00.901 --> 02:31:01.734
<v Speaker 1>choices and thinks that he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I self medicated with experiences like </v>

3808
02:31:04.531 --> 02:31:05.910
<v Speaker 1>trying to have this experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this experience,</v>

3809
02:31:05.911 --> 02:31:06.930
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have all of this,</v>

3810
02:31:06.931 --> 02:31:07.651
<v Speaker 1>all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this,</v>

3811
02:31:07.651 --> 02:31:08.730
<v Speaker 1>do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know all of this?</v>

3812
02:31:08.970 --> 02:31:11.430
<v Speaker 1>And I sold Medicare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had very severe bulemia Yep.</v>

3813
02:31:11.770 --> 02:31:12.820
<v Speaker 1>That would calm me down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

3814
02:31:12.821 --> 02:31:14.370
<v Speaker 1>we call me down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3815
02:31:14.460 --> 02:31:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm the early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early days of fighting.</v>

3816
02:31:16.031 --> 02:31:18.310
<v Speaker 1>It's actually one of the things I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

3817
02:31:18.490 --> 02:31:19.323
<v Speaker 1>and I don't talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really credit Greg Jackson for </v>

3818
02:31:21.001 --> 02:31:23.070
<v Speaker 1>this and putting me on a pad because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>confessed to him,</v>

3819
02:31:23.071 --> 02:31:23.904
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a problem that I have when I </v>

3820
02:31:24.751 --> 02:31:25.960
<v Speaker 1>first seen him that this is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've,</v>

3821
02:31:26.070 --> 02:31:27.930
<v Speaker 1>I've dealt with a little bit with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatments,</v>

3822
02:31:28.170 --> 02:31:29.340
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I puked my,</v>

3823
02:31:29.370 --> 02:31:34.370
<v Speaker 1>my food up and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't let me any more.</v>

3824
02:31:34.651 --> 02:31:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't let me anywhere,</v>

3825
02:31:35.901 --> 02:31:36.734
<v Speaker 1>but he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he put a lot of care and pressure on me </v>

3826
02:31:38.341 --> 02:31:41.430
<v Speaker 1>to be a more mentally healthy person by </v>
<v Speaker 1>directing that energy,</v>

3827
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:42.503
<v Speaker 1>that panicked energy when we get all </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked up and just have to go puke </v>

3828
02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:46.740
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't know what else to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with myself.</v>

3829
02:31:46.890 --> 02:31:51.300
<v Speaker 1>And he helped me direct that energy into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sport and he gave me tasks to do and</v>

3830
02:31:51.301 --> 02:31:52.920
<v Speaker 1>I ended up working for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just like him.</v>

3831
02:31:52.930 --> 02:31:56.160
<v Speaker 1>He's really fucking good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it really good dude.</v>

3832
02:31:56.340 --> 02:31:57.870
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3833
02:31:57.880 --> 02:31:58.580
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just,</v>

3834
02:31:58.580 --> 02:31:59.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

3835
02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:00.653
<v Speaker 1>I honestly credit him for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he saved my life to a certain </v>

3836
02:32:02.251 --> 02:32:04.990
<v Speaker 1>extent because I got pretty bad there </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a while.</v>

3837
02:32:04.991 --> 02:32:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

3838
02:32:05.880 --> 02:32:06.713
<v Speaker 1>when I moved to Jackson's it was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of that understanding that I'm </v>

3839
02:32:09.930 --> 02:32:10.763
<v Speaker 1>stepping into a new realm where I am a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional athlete now I have to </v>

3840
02:32:14.761 --> 02:32:17.160
<v Speaker 1>conduct myself a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to eat food a certain way.</v>

3841
02:32:17.161 --> 02:32:19.470
<v Speaker 1>I have to address my body's or we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

3842
02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:20.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3843
02:32:20.850 --> 02:32:21.683
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took a burden off of me that made me </v>

3844
02:32:23.401 --> 02:32:24.234
<v Speaker 1>panic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how to explain that to </v>

3845
02:32:24.931 --> 02:32:25.590
<v Speaker 1>give me purpose.</v>

3846
02:32:25.590 --> 02:32:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe to be somebody that's somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else's invested in to understand,</v>

3847
02:32:30.451 --> 02:32:30.901
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3848
02:32:30.901 --> 02:32:31.734
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're my first female MMA fighter that </v>

3849
02:32:33.451 --> 02:32:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I really want to put work into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't get fucking pregnant.</v>

3850
02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Don't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't puke anymore.</v>

3851
02:32:37.711 --> 02:32:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3852
02:32:38.270 --> 02:32:39.103
<v Speaker 1>usually we put some rules in place for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me when I came there because he said he </v>

3853
02:32:41.341 --> 02:32:42.510
<v Speaker 1>wasn't really on board with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3854
02:32:42.511 --> 02:32:44.430
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say that because I always </v>
<v Speaker 1>get him a lot of shit.</v>

3855
02:32:44.580 --> 02:32:46.470
<v Speaker 1>He was on board with female mma and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

3856
02:32:46.471 --> 02:32:48.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he saw my carano fight,</v>

3857
02:32:48.001 --> 02:32:49.710
<v Speaker 1>he liked it and he liked me and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

3858
02:32:49.711 --> 02:32:51.300
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give this a shot.</v>

3859
02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:55.980
<v Speaker 1>And for me it saved my life because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know where I would be without mma.</v>

3860
02:32:56.580 --> 02:32:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

3861
02:32:58.110 --> 02:32:59.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when it comes to,</v>

3862
02:32:59.940 --> 02:33:00.773
<v Speaker 1>I guess the bulemia and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self sabotage that I was doing to </v>

3863
02:33:03.841 --> 02:33:08.841
<v Speaker 1>myself competing in the sport and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finding purpose,</v>

3864
02:33:09.790 --> 02:33:10.770
<v Speaker 1>it was really important.</v>

3865
02:33:10.770 --> 02:33:12.510
<v Speaker 1>And just the talks I would have with him</v>
<v Speaker 1>about like,</v>

3866
02:33:12.511 --> 02:33:14.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and this kind of thing.</v>

3867
02:33:14.761 --> 02:33:15.594
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to find people to talk about </v>

3868
02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:20.860
<v Speaker 1>some intellectual subjects with </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in that sport or antigen.</v>

3869
02:33:20.870 --> 02:33:21.703
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to be able to sit down and break </v>

3870
02:33:22.681 --> 02:33:24.000
<v Speaker 1>things down and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3871
02:33:24.001 --> 02:33:25.470
<v Speaker 1>I can use my brain this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is great.</v>

3872
02:33:25.860 --> 02:33:27.660
<v Speaker 1>And then when I quit fighting and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>moved to Kansas,</v>

3873
02:33:27.661 --> 02:33:31.470
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have that bubble anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have that,</v>

3874
02:33:31.471 --> 02:33:33.000
<v Speaker 1>that home or that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feeling.</v>

3875
02:33:33.001 --> 02:33:33.571
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3876
02:33:33.571 --> 02:33:34.404
<v Speaker 1>And so it was just like I just slid </v>
<v Speaker 1>right backwards and I was gaining all </v>

3877
02:33:36.901 --> 02:33:37.860
<v Speaker 1>this weight and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3878
02:33:37.861 --> 02:33:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I just became very eating poorly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3879
02:33:39.721 --> 02:33:40.830
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3880
02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:41.693
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar is so addictive when you actually </v>

3881
02:33:43.831 --> 02:33:45.450
<v Speaker 1>get to eat it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you do?</v>

3882
02:33:45.451 --> 02:33:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels so good.</v>

3883
02:33:46.840 --> 02:33:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

3884
02:33:48.570 --> 02:33:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I went through a rough time there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I,</v>

3885
02:33:52.350 --> 02:33:54.210
<v Speaker 1>I found school and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

3886
02:33:54.270 --> 02:33:56.310
<v Speaker 1>I can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where my energy can be.</v>

3887
02:33:56.760 --> 02:33:57.430
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

3888
02:33:57.430 --> 02:33:58.990
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome that you found something.</v>

3889
02:33:58.991 --> 02:33:59.824
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would really think that diet would </v>

3890
02:34:00.821 --> 02:34:03.700
<v Speaker 2>have also a pretty significant effect on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way your brain works.</v>

3891
02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:04.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>

3892
02:34:04.450 --> 02:34:06.820
<v Speaker 2>do you monitor that now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you take care of yourself now?</v>

3893
02:34:07.130 --> 02:34:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3894
02:34:07.820 --> 02:34:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I actually,</v>

3895
02:34:09.111 --> 02:34:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I still,</v>

3896
02:34:10.351 --> 02:34:11.184
<v Speaker 1>I'll drink sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll put sugar in a drink or </v>

3897
02:34:12.801 --> 02:34:13.820
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

3898
02:34:13.821 --> 02:34:15.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't care for it as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

3899
02:34:15.421 --> 02:34:16.910
<v Speaker 1>my tastes have kind of changed over </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3900
02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I like vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like meat.</v>

3901
02:34:19.420 --> 02:34:19.811
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3902
02:34:19.811 --> 02:34:22.690
<v Speaker 1>vegetables and meat were a huge staple </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was fighting.</v>

3903
02:34:22.691 --> 02:34:25.600
<v Speaker 1>And now when I find myself just being </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn to that anyway,</v>

3904
02:34:25.630 --> 02:34:26.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3905
02:34:26.651 --> 02:34:27.131
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3906
02:34:27.131 --> 02:34:28.030
<v Speaker 1>post fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3907
02:34:28.031 --> 02:34:31.570
<v Speaker 1>it's the orgy of sugar in things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were never allowed to have.</v>

3908
02:34:31.580 --> 02:34:33.550
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

3909
02:34:33.551 --> 02:34:34.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you weren't,</v>

3910
02:34:34.210 --> 02:34:36.100
<v Speaker 1>body reasoning wasn't designed to eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>this anyway,</v>

3911
02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:37.113
<v Speaker 1>so it's going to affect your brain to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just give yourself like a cheat day or </v>

3912
02:34:40.241 --> 02:34:43.600
<v Speaker 1>award day or some point that what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do is,</v>

3913
02:34:44.030 --> 02:34:44.863
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this could come from a lifetime of </v>

3914
02:34:46.030 --> 02:34:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't,</v>

3915
02:34:47.741 --> 02:34:48.131
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3916
02:34:48.131 --> 02:34:48.941
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3917
02:34:48.941 --> 02:34:49.611
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3918
02:34:49.611 --> 02:34:51.640
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up very Catholic.</v>

3919
02:34:51.860 --> 02:34:54.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm very not Catholic now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell my grandma.</v>

3920
02:34:54.430 --> 02:34:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3921
02:34:55.301 --> 02:34:57.430
<v Speaker 1>but what I don't do is I don't beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself up.</v>

3922
02:34:57.640 --> 02:34:59.890
<v Speaker 1>If I eat junk food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

3923
02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the next meal is going to be healthy</v>

3924
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.960
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3925
02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:04.270
<v Speaker 2>so you're more concerned with overall </v>
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>

3926
02:35:04.271 --> 02:35:05.530
<v Speaker 2>mental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical,</v>

3927
02:35:05.531 --> 02:35:08.170
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to be obsessive about something,</v>

3928
02:35:08.171 --> 02:35:11.020
<v Speaker 2>it's actually probably worse than just </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a little sugar.</v>

3929
02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3930
02:35:12.180 --> 02:35:14.260
<v Speaker 1>and I guess when it to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3931
02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:15.333
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then it's self flagellation </v>

3932
02:35:16.530 --> 02:35:17.440
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're just like,</v>

3933
02:35:17.441 --> 02:35:18.011
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3934
02:35:18.011 --> 02:35:18.844
<v Speaker 1>I just not everything is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to eat this terrible </v>

3935
02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:21.311
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3936
02:35:21.311 --> 02:35:22.144
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just goes down that spiral and it's </v>

3937
02:35:23.051 --> 02:35:27.640
<v Speaker 1>kind of dumb and I realized that I need </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to be obsessive about and that</v>

3938
02:35:27.641 --> 02:35:29.880
<v Speaker 1>has actually come through writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3939
02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:31.060
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3940
02:35:31.061 --> 02:35:31.894
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and working towards like I'd love to </v>

3941
02:35:32.771 --> 02:35:36.850
<v Speaker 1>write the great book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the book I'm working on it</v>

3942
02:35:38.870 --> 02:35:41.460
<v Speaker 2>of thinking that you have with lend </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself towards something like that.</v>

3943
02:35:41.461 --> 02:35:45.600
<v Speaker 2>So obsessive style thinking like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could really be an amazing tool for you.</v>

3944
02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:47.100
<v Speaker 1>I would hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope.</v>

3945
02:35:47.140 --> 02:35:50.530
<v Speaker 1>And I it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess translating mma to people,</v>

3946
02:35:50.890 --> 02:35:53.740
<v Speaker 1>not just in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

3947
02:35:53.830 --> 02:35:54.670
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

3948
02:35:54.730 --> 02:35:56.110
<v Speaker 1>when I first came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came into,</v>

3949
02:35:56.111 --> 02:35:56.621
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3950
02:35:56.621 --> 02:35:57.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with them a man,</v>

3951
02:35:57.481 --> 02:35:58.031
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3952
02:35:58.031 --> 02:35:59.230
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3953
02:35:59.231 --> 02:36:01.600
<v Speaker 1>but these are my people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even,</v>

3954
02:36:01.601 --> 02:36:01.720
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3955
02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:04.000
<v Speaker 2>What about your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just your life experiences itself?</v>

3956
02:36:04.030 --> 02:36:04.863
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from a point of view of someone </v>

3957
02:36:05.711 --> 02:36:06.544
<v Speaker 2>like you is so smart and articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that your memoirs or </v>

3958
02:36:09.761 --> 02:36:11.730
<v Speaker 2>what you would be able to describe about</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3959
02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:12.663
<v Speaker 2>your days competing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be really fascinating and </v>

3960
02:36:14.621 --> 02:36:15.490
<v Speaker 2>compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3961
02:36:15.940 --> 02:36:16.773
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely worked on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've written some things to that </v>

3962
02:36:19.211 --> 02:36:20.370
<v Speaker 1>extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3963
02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:22.990
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that they picked up for sports</v>
<v Speaker 1>illustrated was really nice.</v>

3964
02:36:22.991 --> 02:36:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was nice.</v>

3965
02:36:23.921 --> 02:36:25.210
<v Speaker 1>That was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a help.</v>

3966
02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like things to be on a little bit.</v>

3967
02:36:28.770 --> 02:36:31.810
<v Speaker 1>It gets a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not woo woo like literary level,</v>

3968
02:36:31.811 --> 02:36:32.740
<v Speaker 1>but just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that's,</v>

3969
02:36:32.741 --> 02:36:33.574
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like symbol a little bit more </v>

3970
02:36:35.651 --> 02:36:36.850
<v Speaker 1>symbolism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more.</v>

3971
02:36:36.851 --> 02:36:37.684
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno when I wrote the piece about </v>

3972
02:36:39.311 --> 02:36:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Chi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the piece that got me into Iowa.</v>

3973
02:36:42.390 --> 02:36:43.223
<v Speaker 1>It was the piece about cutting weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I decided to retire and when I cut </v>

3974
02:36:45.731 --> 02:36:46.564
<v Speaker 1>weight and I was in Australia and I saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>this painting and it just changed </v>

3975
02:36:48.071 --> 02:36:49.390
<v Speaker 1>everything and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

3976
02:36:49.820 --> 02:36:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3978
02:36:52.950 --> 02:36:56.890

<v Speaker 1>this woman with a hat on her head,</v>

3979
02:36:57.270 --> 02:36:58.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot remember the name of it.</v>

3983
02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:09.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm drawing a blank right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eggs.</v>

3984
02:37:09.041 --> 02:37:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Think about eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about eggs,</v>

3985
02:37:11.230 --> 02:37:13.640
<v Speaker 1>how eggs are prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poached,</v>

3986
02:37:13.641 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 1>scramble and keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep going.</v>

3987
02:37:17.500 --> 02:37:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Hollandaise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3988
02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:21.860
<v Speaker 1>was Moselle holidays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has something to that effect.</v>

3989
02:37:21.861 --> 02:37:24.110
<v Speaker 1>I believe I have the print in my room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now I just,</v>

3990
02:37:24.111 --> 02:37:24.944
<v Speaker 1>I don't look at the titles of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did the images more than </v>

3991
02:37:26.961 --> 02:37:27.794
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I saw this painting and I was in a </v>

3992
02:37:30.141 --> 02:37:33.140
<v Speaker 1>museum in Australia and I was cutting </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight for my fight.</v>

3993
02:37:33.141 --> 02:37:33.974
<v Speaker 1>I had all my sweats on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was in an art museum and I saw it </v>

3994
02:37:35.211 --> 02:37:36.044
<v Speaker 1>and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like it was talking to me all of </v>

3995
02:37:37.551 --> 02:37:40.490
<v Speaker 1>a sudden and I was just like delirious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you were losing weight.</v>

3996
02:37:41.060 --> 02:37:43.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but symbolically I know what you mean.</v>

3997
02:37:43.911 --> 02:37:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Like the symbolism there.</v>

3998
02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to myself.</v>

3999
02:37:49.330 --> 02:37:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

4000
02:37:50.020 --> 02:37:51.380
<v Speaker 1>That's the painting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4001
02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:55.070
<v Speaker 1>And I just looked at that and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Labelle,</v>

4002
02:37:55.080 --> 02:37:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Hollandaise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

4003
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Not memo sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suck at names.</v>

4004
02:37:58.260 --> 02:37:59.001
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another,</v>

4005
02:37:59.001 --> 02:38:01.700
<v Speaker 1>I have a very bad memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

4006
02:38:01.701 --> 02:38:03.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked at that and I just,</v>

4007
02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:06.020
<v Speaker 1>I connected with this painting and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>

4008
02:38:06.021 --> 02:38:06.854
<v Speaker 1>weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just saw it and I couldn't stop </v>

4009
02:38:08.661 --> 02:38:10.790
<v Speaker 1>talking to it in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4010
02:38:10.820 --> 02:38:13.760
<v Speaker 1>like there's this a person I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you now and it just,</v>

4011
02:38:13.761 --> 02:38:15.270
<v Speaker 1>and I wrote about this for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like,</v>

4012
02:38:15.271 --> 02:38:15.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

4013
02:38:15.651 --> 02:38:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm done.</v>

4014
02:38:17.150 --> 02:38:17.983
<v Speaker 1>And I knew that in that museum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just standing there looking at this </v>

4015
02:38:19.431 --> 02:38:20.810
<v Speaker 1>painting before my fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4016
02:38:20.830 --> 02:38:23.130
<v Speaker 1>you sure you weren't just looking for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sign.</v>

4017
02:38:25.190 --> 02:38:26.023
<v Speaker 1>Of course I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was just this beautiful image of </v>

4018
02:38:27.381 --> 02:38:28.730
<v Speaker 1>this woman who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4019
02:38:28.731 --> 02:38:29.564
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look like a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look at anything to do with </v>

4020
02:38:31.011 --> 02:38:32.930
<v Speaker 1>combat is just a naked woman wearing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hat.</v>

4021
02:38:33.170 --> 02:38:34.820
<v Speaker 1>But all of a sudden it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

4022
02:38:34.821 --> 02:38:35.654
<v Speaker 1>that was what I was looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking for that sort of sign and </v>

4023
02:38:38.210 --> 02:38:41.990
<v Speaker 1>that's where it became cohesive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's that moment.</v>

4024
02:38:42.650 --> 02:38:45.200
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just knew I was done.</v>

4025
02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:48.410
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd been looking for excuses for</v>

4026
02:38:48.411 --> 02:38:49.244
<v Speaker 1>a long time before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think I wanted to retire before I </v>

4027
02:38:51.501 --> 02:38:53.180
<v Speaker 1>fought Jermaine Duran to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4028
02:38:53.181 --> 02:38:54.170
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4029
02:38:54.530 --> 02:38:59.210
<v Speaker 1>I was just so tired and I was just so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mind just wasn't going that direction</v>

4030
02:38:59.211 --> 02:39:00.044
<v Speaker 1>that other fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that moment where you know that </v>

4031
02:39:02.781 --> 02:39:06.320
<v Speaker 1>they're just sort of phoning it in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't figure out how to get off.</v>

4032
02:39:06.650 --> 02:39:07.483
<v Speaker 1>And for me it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would overtrain like before the </v>

4033
02:39:08.751 --> 02:39:09.584
<v Speaker 1>Jermaine photos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so overtrained and I was so tired and </v>

4034
02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:14.270
<v Speaker 1>it's just like froze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4035
02:39:14.271 --> 02:39:15.320
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll also,</v>

4036
02:39:15.321 --> 02:39:16.154
<v Speaker 1>she hit like a fucking mack truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like she put me out on my feet in </v>

4037
02:39:18.531 --> 02:39:19.370
<v Speaker 1>the third round it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

4038
02:39:19.371 --> 02:39:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Like she hit me with two right singer </v>
<v Speaker 1>right hand.</v>

4039
02:39:20.991 --> 02:39:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was,</v>

4040
02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:27.380
<v Speaker 1>what did you think about her fight with </v>
<v Speaker 1>holly?</v>

4041
02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:29.950
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4042
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:33.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horrible.</v>

4043
02:39:33.590 --> 02:39:34.970
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that should have been called and</v>

4044
02:39:34.980 --> 02:39:35.813
<v Speaker 1>that should have been appointed acted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean that as an insult to </v>

4045
02:39:38.271 --> 02:39:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Jermaine or anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's combat minded or whatever.</v>

4046
02:39:40.731 --> 02:39:43.910
<v Speaker 1>But that's cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 100% shooting and shit.</v>

4047
02:39:44.530 --> 02:39:45.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was one of those shots and I think </v>

4048
02:39:47.251 --> 02:39:48.110
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4049
02:39:48.111 --> 02:39:50.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something that she saw that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could do.</v>

4050
02:39:50.001 --> 02:39:51.970
<v Speaker 1>And she did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're disappointed when they didn't.</v>

4051
02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:54.140
<v Speaker 1>They denied her protest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4052
02:39:54.141 --> 02:39:55.520
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've protest.</v>

4053
02:39:55.521 --> 02:39:56.354
<v Speaker 1>That was a very legitimate honor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not something in the hall has </v>

4054
02:39:59.001 --> 02:39:59.990
<v Speaker 1>ever done before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4055
02:39:59.991 --> 02:40:01.070
<v Speaker 1>she's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4056
02:40:01.460 --> 02:40:02.293
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not like she doesn't accept a </v>

4057
02:40:03.071 --> 02:40:03.650
<v Speaker 1>feat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4058
02:40:03.650 --> 02:40:05.780
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't accept defeat as I will keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving forward,</v>

4059
02:40:05.781 --> 02:40:06.830
<v Speaker 1>but she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't,</v>

4060
02:40:06.890 --> 02:40:07.723
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't find excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've known that woman for almost a </v>

4061
02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:11.360
<v Speaker 1>decade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't look for excuses.</v>

4062
02:40:11.361 --> 02:40:14.280
<v Speaker 1>She looks for ways to improve and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

4063
02:40:14.281 --> 02:40:15.114
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt putting a protest in is very </v>

4064
02:40:17.131 --> 02:40:17.964
<v Speaker 1>legitimate,</v>

4065
02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:20.260
<v Speaker 2>very legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Holly Holmes another one,</v>

4066
02:40:20.261 --> 02:40:21.094
<v Speaker 2>she's all heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she came back from a deficit and </v>

4067
02:40:23.131 --> 02:40:24.870
<v Speaker 2>that fight landed that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that um,</v>

4068
02:40:25.060 --> 02:40:29.200
<v Speaker 2>question mark kick over the shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was beautiful.</v>

4069
02:40:29.780 --> 02:40:30.613
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the best question mark </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks I've ever seen landed inside the </v>

4070
02:40:33.101 --> 02:40:33.934
<v Speaker 2>octagon against a really tricky Moitai </v>
<v Speaker 2>opponent who was getting the better of </v>

4071
02:40:36.941 --> 02:40:37.774
<v Speaker 2>her early on.</v>

4072
02:40:39.190 --> 02:40:40.023
<v Speaker 1>Holly is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the world hasn't even seen </v>

4073
02:40:42.601 --> 02:40:43.920
<v Speaker 1>the best Holly Holm yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4074
02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:47.010
<v Speaker 1>I know that sounds weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's 36,</v>

4075
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:48.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>35.</v>

4076
02:40:48.781 --> 02:40:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's more to her though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potential.</v>

4077
02:40:51.961 --> 02:40:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we haven't even seen yet.</v>

4078
02:40:53.910 --> 02:40:55.530
<v Speaker 1>But we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if that is going to,</v>

4079
02:40:55.800 --> 02:40:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what her plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't talk,</v>

4080
02:40:57.090 --> 02:40:57.923
<v Speaker 2>there's not a company we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about with The v tour thing though that </v>

4081
02:40:59.861 --> 02:41:02.070
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your experience and your,</v>

4082
02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:06.480
<v Speaker 2>your ability and your knowledge gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmed by father time.</v>

4083
02:41:06.481 --> 02:41:10.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like father time and they come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a cross in the road and you have</v>

4084
02:41:10.621 --> 02:41:13.470
<v Speaker 2>to figure out like how much experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have,</v>

4085
02:41:13.471 --> 02:41:14.304
<v Speaker 2>how much knowledge and whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body can actually act on those </v>

4086
02:41:16.351 --> 02:41:17.184
<v Speaker 2>things anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it comes a point where they're </v>

4087
02:41:18.900 --> 02:41:19.640
<v Speaker 2>just</v>

4088
02:41:19.640 --> 02:41:20.101
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4089
02:41:20.101 --> 02:41:21.840
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4090
02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:25.410
<v Speaker 1>I'd say that's pretty early to say about</v>
<v Speaker 1>her in her mma career,</v>

4091
02:41:25.411 --> 02:41:28.800
<v Speaker 1>but she has had all that boxing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing experience before this maybe,</v>

4092
02:41:28.801 --> 02:41:31.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she has like,</v>

4093
02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:34.950
<v Speaker 1>ah Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's so inspirational.</v>

4094
02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:37.370
<v Speaker 2>And she finds that she lost that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing match.</v>

4095
02:41:37.540 --> 02:41:40.460
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] was so hard to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brutal and,</v>

4096
02:41:40.461 --> 02:41:43.060
<v Speaker 2>and the ref not horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should have stopped that fight.</v>

4097
02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

4098
02:41:45.001 --> 02:41:47.550
<v Speaker 1>And her mentality coming out of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

4099
02:41:48.010 --> 02:41:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I had to be her sparring partner after </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fight.</v>

4100
02:41:49.441 --> 02:41:51.570
<v Speaker 1>If that tells you which brand image I </v>
<v Speaker 1>might have now.</v>

4101
02:41:51.571 --> 02:41:54.150
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet her mentality of not,</v>

4102
02:41:54.210 --> 02:41:55.043
<v Speaker 1>she refused to interact with people or </v>
<v Speaker 1>have people corner heard that would </v>

4103
02:41:58.471 --> 02:42:00.660
<v Speaker 1>doubt that she could win that fight in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future refused.</v>

4104
02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:02.033
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

4105
02:42:02.170 --> 02:42:06.060
<v Speaker 1>she is such a champion mind that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people thought she would,</v>

4106
02:42:06.061 --> 02:42:07.800
<v Speaker 1>that she would take corrections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would take,</v>

4107
02:42:07.801 --> 02:42:08.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

4108
02:42:08.161 --> 02:42:09.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to switch this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this up.</v>

4109
02:42:09.871 --> 02:42:10.704
<v Speaker 1>I've got to do this differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you believe that she shouldn't </v>

4110
02:42:12.661 --> 02:42:14.760
<v Speaker 1>have the rematch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wouldn't work with you.</v>

4111
02:42:15.500 --> 02:42:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because she was like,</v>

4112
02:42:16.561 --> 02:42:17.394
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't have somebody not believing in </v>

4113
02:42:18.271 --> 02:42:18.930
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>

4114
02:42:18.930 --> 02:42:20.760
<v Speaker 1>it was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very inspiration.</v>

4115
02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:23.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did,</v>

4116
02:42:24.170 --> 02:42:25.150
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4117
02:42:25.210 --> 02:42:26.120
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a warrior.</v>

4118
02:42:26.180 --> 02:42:27.830
<v Speaker 2>No doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4119
02:42:28.250 --> 02:42:31.310
<v Speaker 2>So we only have a couple more minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking so much.</v>

4120
02:42:31.311 --> 02:42:32.144
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry you had a bunch of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still throw some months because I </v>

4121
02:42:34.311 --> 02:42:35.530
<v Speaker 2>know you've got them written down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It</v>

4122
02:42:35.530 --> 02:42:37.660
<v Speaker 1>was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when we went back to the,</v>

4123
02:42:37.661 --> 02:42:39.340
<v Speaker 1>and these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4124
02:42:39.341 --> 02:42:40.540
<v Speaker 1>it's the shorthand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

4125
02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:41.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the who,</v>

4126
02:42:41.231 --> 02:42:43.150
<v Speaker 1>where are you when you started and who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are you now?</v>

4127
02:42:43.151 --> 02:42:43.984
<v Speaker 1>And I guess what goes with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I ask these questions because I've </v>

4128
02:42:47.171 --> 02:42:48.004
<v Speaker 1>been asking them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people in the sport or in this </v>

4129
02:42:49.601 --> 02:42:52.330
<v Speaker 1>industry are people who are high level </v>
<v Speaker 1>in what they're doing.</v>

4130
02:42:53.410 --> 02:42:57.490
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you have left behind?</v>

4131
02:42:58.060 --> 02:43:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you regret?</v>

4132
02:43:00.011 --> 02:43:02.590
<v Speaker 1>What would you have left behind in </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming who you are now?</v>

4133
02:43:03.430 --> 02:43:05.140
<v Speaker 1>What could you have changed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't need to,</v>

4134
02:43:05.141 --> 02:43:07.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard question to ask because </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to look baton rouge.</v>

4135
02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh I regret this because we learned from</v>
<v Speaker 1>our regrets.</v>

4136
02:43:10.001 --> 02:43:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if there's,</v>

4137
02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:12.100
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you</v>

4138
02:43:12.100 --> 02:43:13.960
<v Speaker 3>could have changed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could have done differently.</v>

4139
02:43:13.961 --> 02:43:14.580
<v Speaker 3>Would you have,</v>

4140
02:43:14.580 --> 02:43:17.010
<v Speaker 2>I think all of my errors of made me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better person.</v>

4141
02:43:17.070 --> 02:43:19.110
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think they're bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

4142
02:43:19.111 --> 02:43:21.540
<v Speaker 2>I think you mean that's a real cliche </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

4143
02:43:21.541 --> 02:43:23.910
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't make mistakes or you,</v>

4144
02:43:23.911 --> 02:43:25.290
<v Speaker 2>if you do make mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn.</v>

4145
02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:27.540
<v Speaker 2>If you don't make mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you grow and you improve.</v>

4146
02:43:27.570 --> 02:43:30.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean like it's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look,</v>

4147
02:43:30.190 --> 02:43:31.530
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not what happens.</v>

4148
02:43:31.531 --> 02:43:32.640
<v Speaker 2>It's how you react to what happened</v>

4149
02:43:32.820 --> 02:43:36.600
<v Speaker 3>and what one mistake do you think like </v>
<v Speaker 3>really defined you to make you better?</v>

4150
02:43:36.750 --> 02:43:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not One.</v>

4151
02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:39.480
<v Speaker 2>It's just a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4152
02:43:40.260 --> 02:43:41.520
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a million of them.</v>

4153
02:43:42.060 --> 02:43:44.130
<v Speaker 2>There's nowhere to even start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

4154
02:43:44.131 --> 02:43:44.964
<v Speaker 2>You're just constantly make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make mistakes with your friends and </v>

4155
02:43:46.921 --> 02:43:47.754
<v Speaker 2>make mistakes with the people you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved with romantically you mixed </v>

4156
02:43:50.611 --> 02:43:54.210
<v Speaker 2>mistakes careerwise and make mistakes </v>
<v Speaker 2>with comedy and art,</v>

4157
02:43:54.211 --> 02:43:56.850
<v Speaker 2>you're constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a constant process of mistakes,</v>

4158
02:43:57.380 --> 02:43:58.980
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're writing new stuff</v>

4159
02:43:58.981 --> 02:44:00.840
<v Speaker 2>with Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's constant mistakes,</v>

4160
02:44:00.841 --> 02:44:01.674
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think testing yourself and constantly </v>

4161
02:44:06.271 --> 02:44:11.271
<v Speaker 2>seeking improvement and constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to expand upon your creative work</v>

4162
02:44:13.350 --> 02:44:15.210
<v Speaker 2>and expand upon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4163
02:44:15.211 --> 02:44:15.870
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're,</v>

4164
02:44:15.870 --> 02:44:19.190
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing as a martial artist or</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing as an athlete or what,</v>

4165
02:44:19.270 --> 02:44:20.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>improving upon your,</v>

4166
02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:24.000
<v Speaker 2>your conditioning drills and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>advance in Yoga,</v>

4167
02:44:24.180 --> 02:44:25.800
<v Speaker 2>get better at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>

4168
02:44:25.801 --> 02:44:28.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm always doing something that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>failing in.</v>

4169
02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:30.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a big part of it.</v>

4170
02:44:30.681 --> 02:44:33.070
<v Speaker 2>I like doing new things and socking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

4171
02:44:33.071 --> 02:44:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's good too.</v>

4172
02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:36.250
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in that,</v>

4173
02:44:36.280 --> 02:44:37.870
<v Speaker 3>in that vein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess of reasoning,</v>

4174
02:44:37.900 --> 02:44:40.840
<v Speaker 3>what do you carry into this like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4175
02:44:41.170 --> 02:44:42.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the exact numbers of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>

4176
02:44:42.821 --> 02:44:43.840
<v Speaker 3>but it's huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4177
02:44:43.841 --> 02:44:46.090
<v Speaker 3>Like I mean you get huge amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>downloads.</v>

4178
02:44:46.410 --> 02:44:47.243
<v Speaker 3>I'm your number one or in the top at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least the top five all the time for you </v>

4179
02:44:50.861 --> 02:44:51.551
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever pot.</v>

4180
02:44:51.551 --> 02:44:52.384
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what do you carry into this space </v>

4181
02:44:53.831 --> 02:44:56.290
<v Speaker 3>with people that you don't want to leave</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind?</v>

4182
02:44:56.350 --> 02:44:57.183
<v Speaker 3>Like what is it that you think you bring</v>
<v Speaker 3>to this that I don't want to leave </v>

4183
02:44:59.231 --> 02:45:02.080
<v Speaker 3>behind like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you carried since you were young,</v>

4184
02:45:02.081 --> 02:45:02.914
<v Speaker 3>since you first started in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entertainment industry or an in mma or </v>

4185
02:45:04.991 --> 02:45:05.824
<v Speaker 3>in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what part of Joe do you bring into this </v>

4186
02:45:08.531 --> 02:45:10.080
<v Speaker 3>space and that you continue to bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

4187
02:45:10.340 --> 02:45:11.173
<v Speaker 2>I definitely don't think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if there was anything it would be </v>

4188
02:45:13.570 --> 02:45:14.403
<v Speaker 2>genuine curiosity I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've genuinely curious about things and </v>

4189
02:45:17.471 --> 02:45:19.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to make this as entertaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>

4190
02:45:19.631 --> 02:45:24.280
<v Speaker 2>So I do my best to try to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation flow as,</v>

4191
02:45:24.430 --> 02:45:25.263
<v Speaker 2>and I don't always succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fail all the time and that failure </v>

4192
02:45:27.791 --> 02:45:28.624
<v Speaker 2>makes me try better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely think I'm better at </v>

4193
02:45:29.831 --> 02:45:30.664
<v Speaker 2>podcasting now than I was six months ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>and better six months ago then it was a </v>

4194
02:45:33.550 --> 02:45:34.383
<v Speaker 2>year ago and then I hope I'll be better </v>
<v Speaker 2>a year from now that I am today and </v>

4195
02:45:36.371 --> 02:45:37.204
<v Speaker 2>that's just</v>

4196
02:45:37.500 --> 02:45:38.700
<v Speaker 3>beck is fail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fail,</v>

4197
02:45:38.940 --> 02:45:40.210
<v Speaker 3>fail better all the</v>

4198
02:45:40.210 --> 02:45:41.560
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's also,</v>

4199
02:45:41.561 --> 02:45:42.394
<v Speaker 2>this isn't in a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an audio art form and it doesn't </v>

4200
02:45:46.391 --> 02:45:47.224
<v Speaker 2>seem like it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the art of conversation is there's </v>

4201
02:45:49.571 --> 02:45:50.230
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an art,</v>

4202
02:45:50.230 --> 02:45:52.420
<v Speaker 2>there's an interaction to it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>very good at it,</v>

4203
02:45:52.421 --> 02:45:53.254
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the reasons why you </v>
<v Speaker 2>apologize when you accidentally talk </v>

4204
02:45:55.001 --> 02:45:57.340
<v Speaker 2>over each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a part of human interaction.</v>

4205
02:45:57.380 --> 02:46:00.070
<v Speaker 2>We talk over each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we accidentally do or sometimes you have</v>

4206
02:46:00.071 --> 02:46:02.290
<v Speaker 2>a point that you feel like you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in now or just forget it.</v>

4207
02:46:02.590 --> 02:46:03.423
<v Speaker 2>I mean and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of like how to do it the </v>

4208
02:46:05.081 --> 02:46:05.914
<v Speaker 2>right way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I've found </v>

4209
02:46:07.151 --> 02:46:09.950
<v Speaker 2>from doing podcasts is how bad are at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

4210
02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:10.993
<v Speaker 2>It's really frustrating to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>really a self centered people that just </v>

4211
02:46:14.691 --> 02:46:15.524
<v Speaker 2>talk over everyone and don't listen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what anybody has to say and aren't </v>

4212
02:46:18.590 --> 02:46:19.423
<v Speaker 2>genuinely listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just waiting for their chain to </v>

4213
02:46:20.991 --> 02:46:22.120
<v Speaker 2>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

4214
02:46:22.250 --> 02:46:23.083
<v Speaker 2>that is really frustrating and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize the art of conversation is </v>

4215
02:46:27.651 --> 02:46:30.260
<v Speaker 2>something that's cultivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that you,</v>

4216
02:46:30.261 --> 02:46:31.094
<v Speaker 2>you have to work on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are a lot of people just </v>

4217
02:46:32.721 --> 02:46:33.860
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not good at it</v>

4218
02:46:34.630 --> 02:46:37.060
<v Speaker 3>cause you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be aware that you're weaving</v>

4219
02:46:37.061 --> 02:46:39.610
<v Speaker 3>something into a bigger picture as </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed to yeah.</v>

4220
02:46:39.611 --> 02:46:42.070
<v Speaker 3>As opposed to just saying what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying and then walking out.</v>

4221
02:46:42.100 --> 02:46:43.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4222
02:46:43.450 --> 02:46:44.283
<v Speaker 3>Listening is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're a very good listener and </v>

4223
02:46:46.211 --> 02:46:47.044
<v Speaker 3>I think that that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I see from the outside that </v>

4224
02:46:49.210 --> 02:46:51.700
<v Speaker 3>you're able to do well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'd love to emulate you as a,</v>

4225
02:46:51.740 --> 02:46:54.490
<v Speaker 3>as a commentator in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you is creating this space.</v>

4226
02:46:54.710 --> 02:46:55.540
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to,</v>

4227
02:46:55.540 --> 02:46:56.373
<v Speaker 3>to model a certain amount of myself </v>
<v Speaker 3>after that because I think it's </v>

4228
02:46:58.211 --> 02:46:59.470
<v Speaker 3>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

4229
02:46:59.471 --> 02:47:02.260
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I mean,</v>

4230
02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:03.153
<v Speaker 3>any huge regrets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not meaning you don't have to share </v>

4231
02:47:04.661 --> 02:47:05.494
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but any,</v>

4232
02:47:05.580 --> 02:47:06.820
<v Speaker 3>does anything keep you up at night?</v>

4233
02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:08.720
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4234
02:47:08.840 --> 02:47:09.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

4235
02:47:09.861 --> 02:47:10.694
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's many things in my life that if </v>

4236
02:47:11.571 --> 02:47:12.404
<v Speaker 2>they were presented in front of me right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now learning that I've done them in the </v>

4237
02:47:14.061 --> 02:47:16.040
<v Speaker 2>past and fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do it differently.</v>

4238
02:47:16.041 --> 02:47:17.780
<v Speaker 2>But that's part of being who you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

4239
02:47:18.260 --> 02:47:19.093
<v Speaker 2>I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that word regret is a very dangerous </v>

4240
02:47:21.171 --> 02:47:25.910
<v Speaker 2>word because people far too often define</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves by their past failures.</v>

4241
02:47:25.980 --> 02:47:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Instead of saying that that's not you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not that person.</v>

4242
02:47:30.111 --> 02:47:33.410
<v Speaker 2>You're you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I really truly believe.</v>

4243
02:47:33.411 --> 02:47:34.244
<v Speaker 2>I believe that you are all of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences and in life and all of the </v>

4244
02:47:38.091 --> 02:47:38.924
<v Speaker 2>data that you've acquired and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>revelations and understandings that </v>

4245
02:47:41.311 --> 02:47:45.800
<v Speaker 2>we've gathered up because of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive and negative experiences.</v>

4246
02:47:45.801 --> 02:47:47.810
<v Speaker 2>And that creates who you are at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

4247
02:47:48.140 --> 02:47:51.110
<v Speaker 2>And the most interesting people to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>are the people that have been tested,</v>

4248
02:47:51.111 --> 02:47:52.970
<v Speaker 2>that have gone through trials and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribulations.</v>

4249
02:47:52.970 --> 02:47:56.090
<v Speaker 2>And it's one of the reasons why fighters</v>
<v Speaker 2>are so interesting because the emotional</v>

4250
02:47:56.091 --> 02:47:56.924
<v Speaker 2>rollercoaster of a fight camp and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting and competing and not just an </v>

4251
02:48:00.830 --> 02:48:03.900
<v Speaker 2>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people that do Jujitsu and uh,</v>

4252
02:48:04.220 --> 02:48:08.090
<v Speaker 2>boxers and just people that have done </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's very difficult to do.</v>

4253
02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:11.210
<v Speaker 2>You've tested yourself in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>very few people have.</v>

4254
02:48:11.390 --> 02:48:14.210
<v Speaker 2>And so you understand yourself in a much</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeper way.</v>

4255
02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:16.370
<v Speaker 2>You understand where that breaking point</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

4256
02:48:16.371 --> 02:48:18.230
<v Speaker 2>You understand what happens when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>

4257
02:48:18.500 --> 02:48:21.350
<v Speaker 2>You understand who the demons are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind to tell you to break.</v>

4258
02:48:21.860 --> 02:48:22.693
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some people never meet those demons </v>

4259
02:48:24.291 --> 02:48:25.400
<v Speaker 2>and they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're waiting,</v>

4260
02:48:25.401 --> 02:48:26.234
<v Speaker 2>they're waiting for the call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're waiting for that fucking button </v>

4261
02:48:27.811 --> 02:48:31.010
<v Speaker 2>to be pushed so they can pop up into </v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain and wreck havoc.</v>

4262
02:48:31.011 --> 02:48:31.844
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people just want to fight those </v>

4263
02:48:32.451 --> 02:48:34.000
<v Speaker 2>demons and the family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make them up.</v>

4264
02:48:34.010 --> 02:48:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make their own demons up.</v>

4265
02:48:35.661 --> 02:48:38.060
<v Speaker 2>They create problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they create stress.</v>

4266
02:48:38.570 --> 02:48:41.090
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they invoke those demons.</v>

4267
02:48:41.091 --> 02:48:41.924
<v Speaker 2>They asked those demons to come in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>distract them from all the real issues </v>

4268
02:48:44.211 --> 02:48:45.044
<v Speaker 2>that they have in their life and all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that they actually do need to </v>

4269
02:48:46.911 --> 02:48:47.744
<v Speaker 2>deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the real work that the pain of the </v>

4270
02:48:50.751 --> 02:48:51.930
<v Speaker 2>mundane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the f,</v>

4271
02:48:51.980 --> 02:48:52.813
<v Speaker 2>the pain of the boring discipline work </v>
<v Speaker 2>is sometimes so great that people does </v>

4272
02:48:58.430 --> 02:48:59.263
<v Speaker 2>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why some providers wind up </v>

4273
02:49:00.381 --> 02:49:02.930
<v Speaker 2>fucking off and getting drunk and never </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming to,</v>

4274
02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:06.620
<v Speaker 2>to work out and wind up being in poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>shape and the fight comes off.</v>

4275
02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:09.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not because they didn't know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight was coming.</v>

4276
02:49:09.511 --> 02:49:10.770
<v Speaker 2>He's not the cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a coward.</v>

4277
02:49:10.771 --> 02:49:11.604
<v Speaker 2>It's because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're letting their demons trip them </v>

4278
02:49:13.081 --> 02:49:13.910
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

4279
02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:17.000
<v Speaker 3>I think boredom and that not listening </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect.</v>

4280
02:49:17.001 --> 02:49:19.060
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's also connected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4281
02:49:19.490 --> 02:49:20.440
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

4282
02:49:20.660 --> 02:49:21.493
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that leads people down paths where </v>

4283
02:49:24.470 --> 02:49:26.060
<v Speaker 3>they can't get back from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

4284
02:49:26.090 --> 02:49:27.950
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

4285
02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:29.473
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when we lament the loss of </v>

4286
02:49:31.791 --> 02:49:32.624
<v Speaker 3>somebody who's potential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not always because they were doing </v>

4287
02:49:34.941 --> 02:49:36.710
<v Speaker 3>the wrong things or they lost the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

4288
02:49:36.711 --> 02:49:39.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's because they never recognized </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they can move on from there.</v>

4289
02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:40.393
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4290
02:49:40.570 --> 02:49:44.710
<v Speaker 2>And exploring that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your personal sovereignty,</v>

4291
02:49:45.010 --> 02:49:45.843
<v Speaker 2>exploring your ability to truly manage </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these very difficult scenarios </v>

4292
02:49:49.931 --> 02:49:50.764
<v Speaker 2>that present themselves in life is one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the most interesting and fascinating </v>

4293
02:49:53.231 --> 02:49:54.064
<v Speaker 2>things about studying human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to me it's like the exact opposite </v>

4294
02:49:57.281 --> 02:49:58.114
<v Speaker 2>of the mob mentality when you're swept </v>
<v Speaker 2>away in this group think and you're </v>

4295
02:50:00.821 --> 02:50:01.654
<v Speaker 2>really not responsible for yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your thinking and it's very almost </v>

4296
02:50:04.601 --> 02:50:07.720
<v Speaker 2>selfish way of giving into this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too easy.</v>

4297
02:50:07.721 --> 02:50:09.280
<v Speaker 2>It's too easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many people around.</v>

4298
02:50:09.340 --> 02:50:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go crazy.</v>

4299
02:50:10.770 --> 02:50:13.270
<v Speaker 2>I was like the opposite of like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lone,</v>

4300
02:50:13.271 --> 02:50:15.760
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why I didn't never </v>
<v Speaker 2>really was into team sports.</v>

4301
02:50:16.060 --> 02:50:17.920
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that it's a challenge.</v>

4302
02:50:17.921 --> 02:50:18.754
<v Speaker 2>I understand that it's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's an intensity of the one on </v>

4303
02:50:22.721 --> 02:50:25.990
<v Speaker 2>one competition that cannot be matched </v>
<v Speaker 2>in any other forum.</v>

4304
02:50:26.230 --> 02:50:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one on one playing tennis.</v>

4305
02:50:29.050 --> 02:50:29.883
<v Speaker 2>It's so much more intense than a group </v>
<v Speaker 2>game of volleyball or basketball or </v>

4306
02:50:33.281 --> 02:50:33.770
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

4307
02:50:33.770 --> 02:50:34.603
<v Speaker 3>I would say to that though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given because you are who you are and </v>

4308
02:50:38.121 --> 02:50:40.910
<v Speaker 3>you've built so many quote unquote </v>
<v Speaker 3>followers,</v>

4309
02:50:40.911 --> 02:50:42.770
<v Speaker 3>he built so many people who listen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your opinion.</v>

4310
02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:46.790
<v Speaker 3>You are in a sense on a team and you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>a leader because so many people download</v>

4311
02:50:46.791 --> 02:50:47.624
<v Speaker 3>your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many people want to enter this space </v>

4312
02:50:48.861 --> 02:50:49.694
<v Speaker 3>that you create.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you feel a responsibility to them </v>

4313
02:50:51.801 --> 02:50:54.000
<v Speaker 3>to tell them to think for themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4314
02:50:54.590 --> 02:50:57.480
<v Speaker 2>Hope people just figure that out on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own because there's no way anybody</v>

4315
02:50:57.481 --> 02:50:58.480
<v Speaker 2>could think for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

4316
02:50:58.481 --> 02:50:58.980
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4317
02:50:58.980 --> 02:51:01.680
<v Speaker 2>But I do allow people to think for me in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain way.</v>

4318
02:51:01.890 --> 02:51:04.770
<v Speaker 2>Like when I listen to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I listened to a book on tape,</v>

4319
02:51:05.270 --> 02:51:07.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I listen to a lecture,</v>

4320
02:51:07.410 --> 02:51:08.243
<v Speaker 2>what I'm listening to is I'm allowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this person to direct my thoughts with </v>

4321
02:51:12.091 --> 02:51:14.490
<v Speaker 2>their words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their painting pictures.</v>

4322
02:51:14.491 --> 02:51:15.324
<v Speaker 2>They're explaining facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going over their own personal </v>

4323
02:51:17.281 --> 02:51:18.114
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you are in many ways allowing that </v>

4324
02:51:21.901 --> 02:51:24.750
<v Speaker 2>person to think for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when that's over,</v>

4325
02:51:24.751 --> 02:51:29.160
<v Speaker 2>you think for yourself and you take into</v>
<v Speaker 2>account what that person has said and it</v>

4326
02:51:29.161 --> 02:51:29.994
<v Speaker 2>can enhance your perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if someone's being honest with </v>

4327
02:51:31.861 --> 02:51:32.694
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is one of the most </v>

4328
02:51:32.851 --> 02:51:35.190
<v Speaker 2>important parts of being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of expressing yourself,</v>

4329
02:51:35.191 --> 02:51:37.290
<v Speaker 2>I would like to know what your real </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivations are.</v>

4330
02:51:37.290 --> 02:51:38.610
<v Speaker 2>I want to know what your real thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

4331
02:51:38.611 --> 02:51:41.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to pretend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to be a politician.</v>

4332
02:51:41.821 --> 02:51:42.654
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to just give me some </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit version of who you are because </v>

4333
02:51:45.241 --> 02:51:46.860
<v Speaker 2>you think I'm going to like you more </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that.</v>

4334
02:51:47.060 --> 02:51:50.880
<v Speaker 2>And I think people can tell when </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's doing that,</v>

4335
02:51:50.910 --> 02:51:51.743
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think when someone's not doing </v>

4336
02:51:53.221 --> 02:51:54.480
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when someone's being genuine,</v>

4337
02:51:54.481 --> 02:51:55.740
<v Speaker 2>people cling to it and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4338
02:51:55.741 --> 02:51:57.120
<v Speaker 2>maybe he doesn't know what the fuck he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

4339
02:51:57.330 --> 02:51:59.940
<v Speaker 2>but maybe he's being honest about it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll find out together.</v>

4340
02:51:59.941 --> 02:52:00.774
<v Speaker 2>We'll figure it out together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because at least this dude's telling me </v>

4341
02:52:02.191 --> 02:52:03.660
<v Speaker 2>the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or she's telling me the truth.</v>

4342
02:52:03.661 --> 02:52:04.321
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4343
02:52:04.321 --> 02:52:06.220
<v Speaker 2>this group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an honest group.</v>

4344
02:52:06.550 --> 02:52:08.860
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think we belong for in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this life because this is,</v>

4345
02:52:08.861 --> 02:52:09.694
<v Speaker 2>life is so filled with joy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatic interpretations of reality and </v>

4346
02:52:12.741 --> 02:52:15.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's so much just bullshit,</v>

4347
02:52:15.610 --> 02:52:16.443
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to find truth and we seek </v>

4348
02:52:18.551 --> 02:52:19.510
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

4349
02:52:19.930 --> 02:52:20.763
<v Speaker 2>I think truth is sought in combat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of people that </v>

4350
02:52:23.441 --> 02:52:24.274
<v Speaker 2>seek truth and watching mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when we're talking about that </v>

4351
02:52:26.321 --> 02:52:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Darren Elkins fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no truer moment in the world and</v>

4352
02:52:29.081 --> 02:52:32.410
<v Speaker 2>this guy digging deep and find me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as raw as it gets.</v>

4353
02:52:32.411 --> 02:52:35.670
<v Speaker 2>His face is covered in blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't even fucking see that's a,</v>

4354
02:52:35.700 --> 02:52:37.720
<v Speaker 2>there's a truth in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an escapable.</v>

4355
02:52:37.721 --> 02:52:40.720
<v Speaker 2>You can't dance your way out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't bullshit your way out of him.</v>

4356
02:52:40.900 --> 02:52:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Spotlights and glitter and fucking hype </v>
<v Speaker 2>music desk.</v>

4357
02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:46.390
<v Speaker 2>There's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

4358
02:52:46.391 --> 02:52:49.080
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's down to this,</v>

4359
02:52:49.230 --> 02:52:50.063
<v Speaker 2>this inescapable reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think when people are confronted </v>

4360
02:52:53.561 --> 02:52:54.394
<v Speaker 2>with all the trials and tribulations of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and there's so much confusion and </v>

4361
02:52:57.521 --> 02:52:58.354
<v Speaker 2>we seek inspiration in so many different</v>
<v Speaker 2>avenues and we seek leadership and we </v>

4362
02:53:01.031 --> 02:53:04.810
<v Speaker 2>seek mentorship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we seek like this,</v>

4363
02:53:04.811 --> 02:53:05.644
<v Speaker 2>this hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully this light out there that </v>

4364
02:53:07.961 --> 02:53:08.794
<v Speaker 2>guides us in some sort of a way and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the only ways that we can really </v>

4365
02:53:12.881 --> 02:53:13.714
<v Speaker 2>truly trust that light as if we know </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's coming from a person that has </v>

4366
02:53:16.511 --> 02:53:18.280
<v Speaker 2>committed to the path of honesty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

4367
02:53:18.910 --> 02:53:19.743
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are your tools for discernment </v>

4368
02:53:20.981 --> 02:53:23.110
<v Speaker 1>in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just don't bullshit myself.</v>

4369
02:53:23.180 --> 02:53:24.013
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

4370
02:53:25.240 --> 02:53:29.050
<v Speaker 1>manipulation is so easy to fall into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also so easy to,</v>

4371
02:53:29.230 --> 02:53:31.840
<v Speaker 1>to just resent everybody about then too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like yeah,</v>

4372
02:53:31.960 --> 02:53:33.650
<v Speaker 1>I teach rhetoric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like we,</v>

4373
02:53:33.651 --> 02:53:35.290
<v Speaker 1>we consider a text and we're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4374
02:53:35.291 --> 02:53:37.330
<v Speaker 1>who's the speaker?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the text?</v>

4375
02:53:37.570 --> 02:53:38.320
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4376
02:53:38.320 --> 02:53:40.690
<v Speaker 1>what is the message in the tax?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are they trying to say?</v>

4377
02:53:40.691 --> 02:53:44.190
<v Speaker 1>And then what is this huge like myths </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding all of them.</v>

4378
02:53:44.800 --> 02:53:46.180
<v Speaker 1>What are they trying to do here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

4379
02:53:46.420 --> 02:53:49.090
<v Speaker 1>it's so interesting to see kids' minds </v>
<v Speaker 1>change about like,</v>

4380
02:53:49.120 --> 02:53:49.953
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually have to believe this </v>

4381
02:53:50.741 --> 02:53:54.430
<v Speaker 1>because this is what I've been assigned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I do have to think a certain way or I</v>

4382
02:53:54.431 --> 02:53:55.264
<v Speaker 1>have to consider the source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I begin gets it's kind of a rabbit hole </v>

4383
02:53:57.761 --> 02:53:58.450
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

4384
02:53:58.450 --> 02:53:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4385
02:53:59.110 --> 02:54:03.010
<v Speaker 1>that's where in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the true was religion to me.</v>

4386
02:54:03.011 --> 02:54:03.844
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever you want to call religion </v>

4387
02:54:04.421 --> 02:54:05.231
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's science.</v>

4388
02:54:05.231 --> 02:54:07.040
<v Speaker 1>I just think science is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4389
02:54:07.250 --> 02:54:08.083
<v Speaker 1>the scientific method is based on so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much philosophy so much and it's trying </v>

4390
02:54:11.711 --> 02:54:13.720
<v Speaker 1>to fail all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what he's,</v>

4391
02:54:13.721 --> 02:54:14.554
<v Speaker 1>he's like repeatable results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't get repeatable like </v>

4392
02:54:16.630 --> 02:54:18.730
<v Speaker 1>results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like blind results on something,</v>

4393
02:54:18.760 --> 02:54:21.340
<v Speaker 1>then that's what you're always trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and you're always failing.</v>

4394
02:54:21.560 --> 02:54:23.170
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come from a family scientists,</v>

4395
02:54:23.171 --> 02:54:24.430
<v Speaker 1>so of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's a,</v>

4396
02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:25.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me it's just,</v>

4397
02:54:25.811 --> 02:54:27.550
<v Speaker 1>it's what I love more than anything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

4398
02:54:27.580 --> 02:54:29.350
<v Speaker 1>to hear them talk about how to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

4399
02:54:29.650 --> 02:54:31.210
<v Speaker 1>And then truth is also different from </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact.</v>

4400
02:54:31.480 --> 02:54:32.490
<v Speaker 1>And so when you go down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kay,</v>

4401
02:54:32.491 --> 02:54:34.330
<v Speaker 1>is it truth or is it fact or is it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>painting?</v>

4402
02:54:34.331 --> 02:54:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Like what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets really,</v>

4403
02:54:36.401 --> 02:54:40.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm finding tools for discernment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really,</v>

4404
02:54:40.810 --> 02:54:44.380
<v Speaker 1>that becomes really tricky and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where a hive mine comes from.</v>

4405
02:54:44.381 --> 02:54:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4406
02:54:45.581 --> 02:54:47.500
<v Speaker 1>like people not trying to grab those </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools,</v>

4407
02:54:47.501 --> 02:54:48.334
<v Speaker 1>not trying to assess their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations for latching on to thinking </v>

4408
02:54:50.621 --> 02:54:51.271
<v Speaker 1>that this is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4409
02:54:51.271 --> 02:54:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want their team to win.</v>

4410
02:54:53.290 --> 02:54:54.123
<v Speaker 2>And it's also absorbing information and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of formulating your own viewpoint </v>

4411
02:54:57.401 --> 02:55:00.310
<v Speaker 2>takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long time.</v>

4412
02:55:00.311 --> 02:55:04.250
<v Speaker 2>And who you are today is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than who you are 10 years from</v>

4413
02:55:04.251 --> 02:55:05.084
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that you'd have to </v>

4414
02:55:05.661 --> 02:55:07.870
<v Speaker 2>kind of embrace and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be be,</v>

4415
02:55:07.930 --> 02:55:11.210
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to think it in the moment,</v>

4416
02:55:11.211 --> 02:55:13.250
<v Speaker 2>but be happy for those uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>moments.</v>

4417
02:55:13.251 --> 02:55:14.084
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause those uncomfortable moments or </v>

4418
02:55:14.961 --> 02:55:15.770
<v Speaker 2>that you learned from,</v>

4419
02:55:15.770 --> 02:55:16.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be wrong.</v>

4420
02:55:16.821 --> 02:55:19.370
<v Speaker 1>You have to seek being wrong as much as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

4421
02:55:19.371 --> 02:55:20.204
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to see things that maybe </v>

4422
02:55:21.500 --> 02:55:24.700
<v Speaker 1>change the way you look at things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced things,</v>

4423
02:55:25.180 --> 02:55:26.840
<v Speaker 1>change your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your boundaries,</v>

4424
02:55:26.841 --> 02:55:29.630
<v Speaker 1>change your perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I worry the most for,</v>

4425
02:55:29.631 --> 02:55:33.290
<v Speaker 1>I think as a country for us that we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>so comfortable that,</v>

4426
02:55:33.320 --> 02:55:34.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're soft as fuck.</v>

4427
02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:36.290
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't even mean,</v>

4428
02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:37.153
<v Speaker 1>I don't even mean soft as in like puppy </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit in a plastic bag just because I </v>

4429
02:55:43.401 --> 02:55:45.170
<v Speaker 1>don't know what it is about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

4430
02:55:45.500 --> 02:55:46.333
<v Speaker 1>it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do believe what you said about </v>

4431
02:55:48.441 --> 02:55:50.810
<v Speaker 1>individualism and doing your own thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and striking,</v>

4432
02:55:50.811 --> 02:55:51.644
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forging your own path and stuff like </v>

4433
02:55:52.341 --> 02:55:54.740
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But our inability somehow to,</v>

4434
02:55:54.741 --> 02:55:57.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to commit ourselves to learning.</v>

4435
02:55:57.670 --> 02:55:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not everybody.</v>

4436
02:55:58.881 --> 02:56:00.950
<v Speaker 1>A lot of with car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're committed to learning.</v>

4437
02:56:01.010 --> 02:56:03.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm committed to learning and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people listening to this,</v>

4438
02:56:03.261 --> 02:56:04.340
<v Speaker 1>to the committed to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4439
02:56:04.341 --> 02:56:05.420
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

4440
02:56:05.421 --> 02:56:06.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4441
02:56:06.140 --> 02:56:08.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm banking on that because I actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in people.</v>

4442
02:56:08.301 --> 02:56:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Like I believe that people are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe you believe that.</v>

4443
02:56:12.490 --> 02:56:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I think the group</v>

4444
02:56:13.290 --> 02:56:15.120
<v Speaker 2>think thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is real.</v>

4445
02:56:15.121 --> 02:56:19.130
<v Speaker 2>And what you're talking about is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also think that when,</v>

4446
02:56:19.180 --> 02:56:23.700
<v Speaker 2>when you're judging 350 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible to generalize,</v>

4447
02:56:23.730 --> 02:56:25.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say as a country we're soft,</v>

4448
02:56:25.951 --> 02:56:27.030
<v Speaker 2>we're getting our shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4449
02:56:27.060 --> 02:56:28.260
<v Speaker 2>we're soft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're right.</v>

4450
02:56:28.290 --> 02:56:30.210
<v Speaker 2>A lot of us are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look overall,</v>

4451
02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:32.370
<v Speaker 2>if you looked at the pie chart of soft </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

4452
02:56:32.371 --> 02:56:33.121
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>

4453
02:56:33.121 --> 02:56:36.930
<v Speaker 2>Look how soft we are through the Pi part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of pie chart of ignorant people.</v>

4454
02:56:36.931 --> 02:56:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look how ignorant we are.</v>

4455
02:56:38.670 --> 02:56:39.503
<v Speaker 2>But in that pie chart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in defining people and that sort of a </v>

4456
02:56:42.871 --> 02:56:45.070
<v Speaker 2>broad generalization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4457
02:56:45.080 --> 02:56:45.913
<v Speaker 2>you lose the beauty of individuality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things that's </v>

4458
02:56:49.050 --> 02:56:49.883
<v Speaker 2>unique about us is that we have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability in this country to to seek out </v>

4459
02:56:54.540 --> 02:56:58.380
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of different paths to be who </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would choose to be,</v>

4460
02:56:58.381 --> 02:56:59.214
<v Speaker 2>to follow whatever occupation or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever path of interest that you </v>

4461
02:57:03.870 --> 02:57:05.400
<v Speaker 2>choose to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's,</v>

4462
02:57:05.820 --> 02:57:08.210
<v Speaker 2>that's a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing thing.</v>

4463
02:57:08.540 --> 02:57:09.373
<v Speaker 1>It is a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think those opportunities are </v>

4464
02:57:10.821 --> 02:57:13.640
<v Speaker 1>available to everybody in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>senses.</v>

4465
02:57:13.680 --> 02:57:14.513
<v Speaker 1>And that's just through my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of becoming a fighter and </v>

4466
02:57:16.101 --> 02:57:17.870
<v Speaker 1>having to struggle to be a female </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>

4467
02:57:18.170 --> 02:57:19.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes me think of,</v>

4468
02:57:20.060 --> 02:57:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually privileged to have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to make that decision.</v>

4469
02:57:23.150 --> 02:57:24.080
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4470
02:57:24.081 --> 02:57:24.914
<v Speaker 1>the female fighters after me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think benefit from me making the </v>

4471
02:57:26.431 --> 02:57:29.180
<v Speaker 1>decision and from other fighters like me</v>
<v Speaker 1>making that decision because sure,</v>

4472
02:57:29.210 --> 02:57:30.043
<v Speaker 1>it's moved on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do think that when we look at </v>

4473
02:57:32.361 --> 02:57:34.040
<v Speaker 1>society and we talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

4474
02:57:34.041 --> 02:57:36.110
<v Speaker 1>being soft or not being soft at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people just,</v>

4475
02:57:36.530 --> 02:57:37.363
<v Speaker 1>they can't pull themselves up from their</v>
<v Speaker 1>bootstraps if they don't know where the </v>

4476
02:57:39.381 --> 02:57:41.330
<v Speaker 1>fuck their boots are or where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>trained them.</v>

4477
02:57:41.580 --> 02:57:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4478
02:57:41.900 --> 02:57:45.110
<v Speaker 1>and I do think there's so many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much divisiveness and I think</v>

4479
02:57:45.111 --> 02:57:46.880
<v Speaker 1>that's what leads to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>

4480
02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking perpetuate or of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I go off on,</v>

4481
02:57:50.091 --> 02:57:50.924
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking Maggot guys and this and </v>

4482
02:57:52.341 --> 02:57:52.581
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4483
02:57:52.581 --> 02:57:53.414
<v Speaker 1>I go nuts sometimes I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fall into that anger and I wish I </v>

4484
02:57:55.581 --> 02:57:57.250
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then don't,</v>

4485
02:57:57.650 --> 02:58:00.710
<v Speaker 1>well that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what therapies for it.</v>

4486
02:58:00.711 --> 02:58:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like a good fight.</v>

4487
02:58:02.311 --> 02:58:03.750
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like a good fight.</v>

4488
02:58:04.050 --> 02:58:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4489
02:58:05.170 --> 02:58:05.660
<v Speaker 1>would</v>

4490
02:58:05.660 --> 02:58:06.493
<v Speaker 2>say to you as a friend that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd probably be better off expressing </v>

4491
02:58:09.681 --> 02:58:12.020
<v Speaker 2>that aggressive energy in some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>another outlet.</v>

4492
02:58:12.050 --> 02:58:12.883
<v Speaker 2>I believe you end up interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 2>strangers because another thing about </v>

4493
02:58:16.311 --> 02:58:17.144
<v Speaker 2>some of those people that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>interacting with are fucking losers and </v>

4494
02:58:19.341 --> 02:58:20.174
<v Speaker 2>they will lock onto you and they find </v>
<v Speaker 2>out that you are a source of </v>

4495
02:58:22.311 --> 02:58:23.144
<v Speaker 2>entertainment where they could press </v>
<v Speaker 2>your buttons and make you dance and </v>

4496
02:58:25.821 --> 02:58:26.840
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll keep doing it.</v>

4497
02:58:26.841 --> 02:58:28.130
<v Speaker 2>And that's what trolling is all about.</v>

4498
02:58:28.260 --> 02:58:33.260
<v Speaker 1>It is a phenomenal art form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This trolling that they've taken.</v>

4499
02:58:34.061 --> 02:58:34.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

4500
02:58:34.961 --> 02:58:37.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean the best thing I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered is my mute button.</v>

4501
02:58:37.451 --> 02:58:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Not even blocking people but just muting</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

4502
02:58:39.730 --> 02:58:40.563
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean actually the best thing I've </v>

4503
02:58:41.651 --> 02:58:44.800
<v Speaker 1>discovered is that like I have to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>my phone and physically put it away from</v>

4504
02:58:44.801 --> 02:58:45.634
<v Speaker 1>me and then I can write and I get into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that zone and it feels wonderful and </v>

4505
02:58:47.730 --> 02:58:50.020
<v Speaker 1>it's just like putting the phone away </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just putting it down,</v>

4506
02:58:50.021 --> 02:58:51.620
<v Speaker 1>disconnecting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't want to be,</v>

4507
02:58:51.680 --> 02:58:52.513
<v Speaker 1>I want to connect with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that twitter has done it's big </v>

4508
02:58:54.701 --> 02:58:55.730
<v Speaker 1>great friendships from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4509
02:58:55.900 --> 02:58:56.441
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4510
02:58:56.441 --> 02:58:58.360
<v Speaker 2>one of the beautiful things about doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts,</v>

4511
02:58:58.361 --> 02:58:59.194
<v Speaker 2>one of the things it's taught me is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever have three hour </v>

4512
02:59:01.061 --> 02:59:03.160
<v Speaker 2>conversations with people outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasting.</v>

4513
02:59:03.190 --> 02:59:04.023
<v Speaker 2>Like you and I got deeper and got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know each other better and this </v>

4514
02:59:06.491 --> 02:59:09.160
<v Speaker 2>conversation then we would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we knew each other,</v>

4515
02:59:09.220 --> 02:59:11.380
<v Speaker 2>passing each other with the UFC for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>decade.</v>

4516
02:59:11.830 --> 02:59:12.940
<v Speaker 1>How has it been?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three hours?</v>

4517
02:59:13.150 --> 02:59:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

4518
02:59:14.790 --> 02:59:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we usually do.</v>

4519
02:59:16.780 --> 02:59:19.220
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea it was that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time flies very.</v>

4520
02:59:19.240 --> 02:59:20.670
<v Speaker 1>You always have other guests and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

4521
02:59:21.300 --> 02:59:22.540
<v Speaker 1>all three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I just,</v>

4522
02:59:23.680 --> 02:59:24.250
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

4523
02:59:24.250 --> 02:59:25.083
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever in life do you get to sit </v>

4524
02:59:27.031 --> 02:59:27.864
<v Speaker 2>across from someone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just stare them in the eyes across the </v>

4525
02:59:29.761 --> 02:59:32.760
<v Speaker 2>table like you and I have done for three</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours and just go deep.</v>

4526
02:59:32.830 --> 02:59:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a space you've created,</v>

4527
02:59:34.241 --> 02:59:36.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you've built this pit,</v>

4528
02:59:36.470 --> 02:59:39.100
<v Speaker 1>you're big on that word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Space creating.</v>

4529
02:59:39.101 --> 02:59:40.720
<v Speaker 1>I know writing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4530
02:59:40.721 --> 02:59:41.554
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I was reading all this for </v>

4531
02:59:42.790 --> 02:59:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Carlton's Heterotopia Steph and I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4532
02:59:44.531 --> 02:59:48.220
<v Speaker 1>this is really cool because I see this </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we read and I see this,</v>

4533
02:59:48.221 --> 02:59:50.830
<v Speaker 1>I listen to so many audio books and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many podcasts and I'm just like,</v>

4534
02:59:51.070 --> 02:59:51.903
<v Speaker 1>I'm finding weird spaces in my brain to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be connected to people who don't even </v>

4535
02:59:54.761 --> 02:59:57.460
<v Speaker 1>know who the fuck I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I feel close to them.</v>

4536
02:59:57.580 --> 02:59:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

4537
02:59:58.110 --> 02:59:58.601
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4538
02:59:58.601 --> 03:00:00.280
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what it is and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds,</v>

4539
03:00:00.281 --> 03:00:01.114
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4540
03:00:01.270 --> 03:00:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4541
03:00:02.410 --> 03:00:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should probably stop talking,</v>

4542
03:00:04.721 --> 03:00:07.390
<v Speaker 1>but I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally forgot to plug in.</v>

4543
03:00:07.391 --> 03:00:08.320

<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

4544
03:00:08.321 --> 03:00:09.154
<v Speaker 1>cause I was gonna just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to email all of these </v>

4545
03:00:10.241 --> 03:00:11.440
<v Speaker 1>questions too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

4546
03:00:11.441 --> 03:00:13.870
<v Speaker 1>I could talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I love actually talking to in person</v>

4547
03:00:13.871 --> 03:00:17.170
<v Speaker 1>because I feel like I haven't had the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to actually know you and um,</v>

4548
03:00:17.470 --> 03:00:18.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for when I listen to you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know it's good for me to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird for you and it's good for </v>

4557
03:00:37.871 --> 03:00:38.704
<v Speaker 2>other people to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird for me and it's fucking </v>

4558
03:00:40.661 --> 03:00:41.494
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

03:00:48.981 --> 03:00:49.814
<v Speaker 1>is like the Appalachian trail and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just putting one foot in front of the </v>

4563
03:00:51.741 --> 03:00:53.170
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least it's damn town.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

4565
03:00:55.400 --> 03:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the people who fail,</v>

4566
03:00:57.490 --> 03:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>they decide it's just one foot in front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other,</v>

03:00:59.381 --> 03:01:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I want to stay at</v>
