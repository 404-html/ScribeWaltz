78
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.180

Better business bureau furniture.
Yeah,

79
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.480
it's fucking dressing.
It's ridiculous.

80
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.430

Legal Zoom was developed by top attorneys to provide self help services at your

92
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:43.420
specific direction.
But they are not a law firm.
They can't,
however,

93
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:45.400
connect you with a third party attorney,

94
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.090
like if you're one of those panicky fuckers and you can't handle it.

95
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.680
So if you,
uh,
if you freak out,
they can,
uh,

96
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.880
they can connect you with someone that tells you don't freak out.

97
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.760
You're going to be okay.
It's easy to do though,
folks.
Very easy,

98
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.990
they'll take care of you from start to finish and it's,
it all can be done.

99
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:07.280
Like so much can be done for a fraction of what it would cost you to paint

100
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:09.110
attorney to do these things.
Not,

101
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.230
not to mention the fact that you don't have to drive to an office.

102
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.230
You don't have to make an appointment.
You don't have to park no.
That nonsense.

103
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.880
You could do 99% of all that stuff at legal,

104

Without further ado,
uh,
I try to keep these things in the minimum.

108
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:33.921
Ladies and gentlemen,

109
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:37.370
I know people say to really get you fucking commercials takes so much time.

110
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.040
They don't necessarily have to take so much time.

111
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.310
They take time only because I bullshit during the commercials and also because I

112
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:49.940
really do try to only have things on the podcast that we use.

113
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:54.680
Legal Zoom was used by us to start on it.
The death squad.
Dot.

114
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:58.160
TV legals.
You zoom was used by Brian to start that.
Um,

115
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.250
I only bring things on the podcast as a sponsor that I use legal zoom to get

116
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:08.900
dolce diet renders the years ago.
Legal Zone.
You fucks.

117
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:11.750
That's it.
Boom.
Schelok lock.
Boom.
Cuban music

118
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.690
experience.

119

121
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.120
Thanks for coming on man.
We got a lot of questions.
Got a lot of questions.

122
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.540
Die Questions,
nature box questions.
Granola,

123
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.210
keen Bois chocolate please,
please do good.
There we go.

124
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.580
It's Yummy.
Tell you that it's Yummy as fuck.
You don't have to check that out.

125
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.260
But I want to talk to you about,
um,

126
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.760
a lot of people who don't understand mixed martial arts,
uh,
or,

127
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.350
or maybe they're casual fans.

128
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:56.030
They don't know that there's a lot going on in a MMA and one of the things

129
00:07:56.031 --> 00:08:00.620
that's going on besides the fact that it's a very dangerous,
very,
uh,

130
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.090
it's a highly charged sport with a lot on the line for the competitors.

131
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:07.820
But one of the things that's on the line that a lot of people aren't aware of is

132
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.590
a thing that we call weight cutting.

133
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.090
And so I can feel people in that may just not know much about MMA.

134
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.740
If a fighter is going to fight at,
say,
145 pounds,

135
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:20.780
that's one of our weight classes.
Um,

136
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.780
they probably don't really weigh 145 pounds.

137
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.800
It's very rare that you get a guy like Frankie Edgar who was the lightweight

138
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:31.790
champion who lightweight in the UFC as 155 pounds.

139
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.750
That's what he actually used to way he was in Rio.
He was really fit and uh,

140
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:38.960
he walked around at one 55.
He didn't cut any weight to uh,

141
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.920
to weigh in for the weight class and it was always smaller than almost anyone in

142
00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:43.521
his division.

143
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:47.690
He still won and beat some of the best guys in the planet just cause he's really

144
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:51.260
tough and very highly skilled.
But that's the rarity.

145
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:54.260
The only division where that doesn't take place is in the heavyweight division,

146
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:56.910
which guys don't have to cut any weight at all.
Generally speaking.

147
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.230
There was a few exceptions.

148
00:08:58.231 --> 00:09:01.410
Like Tim Sylvia in his hay day used to be a little bit bigger or Brock Lesnar

149
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:04.860
might've caught a little or a Alistair Overeem when he first fought in the UFC.

150
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:06.810
Cut a little.
But for the most part,

151
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.750
those guys get to eat whatever the fuck they want for everybody else.

152
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:12.570
There's essentially,
there's two different events going on.

153
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.280
There's the event where there's a fight where you're training to compete against

154
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:19.200
the best mixed martial arts fighters in the world.

155
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:24.300
But then there's also the way in and the way in is an event in and of itself is

156
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:29.301
a huge thing because you get guys like a perfect example of extreme examples is

157
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:34.710
glace and t bow.
I don't think glycines missed weight.
Has He ever missed way?

158
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.710
Not that I know of.
You figured out a way to do it.
They get it done,

159
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.470
but in is fucking enormous.

160
00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:45.471
He fights at one 55 I weigh in the high one nineties and he's bigger than me,

161
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.890
so I don't know how the fuck he does it.
I really don't know how the guy does.

162
00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:50.724
It suffers.

163
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.440
He suffers and he gets down to one 55 for a very brief window of time and then

164
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:56.940
rehydrates the shit out of himself.

165
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.640
<v 2>Yeah,
and that's the goal.</v>

166
00:09:58.641 --> 00:10:01.820
Ultimately what we're trying to do is trying to be on wait for the shortest time

167
00:10:01.821 --> 00:10:05.570
possible to minimize the ill effects of being at that weight.

168
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.230
Guy Like Nick Lynch,
one 45 pound,
you're brought up 40 fives so nick lens,

169
00:10:09.231 --> 00:10:13.850
he does most of his training camp around one 75 now.
Whoa,
that's so crazy.

170
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.740
Massive and we want to touch down at 45 and be there for really under an hour.

171
00:10:18.741 --> 00:10:22.550
I want my athletes still kind of dripping that last sweat when they step on the

172
00:10:22.551 --> 00:10:27.200
scale so they can just graze the contract weight and immediately we hydrate them

173
00:10:27.201 --> 00:10:28.034
right back up again.

174
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.240
And when you say nick lense walks around at 175 pounds for folks that are

175
00:10:32.241 --> 00:10:33.920
listening to this,
you're like,
oh,
he gets fat.
No,

176
00:10:33.921 --> 00:10:37.880
he does not know at 10% body fat.
Okay.
That is so crazy.

177
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.680
How is it possible that a guy can be one 75 at 10% body fat,
by the way,

178
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.420
I'm a fat fuck.
I'm about 17% body fat.
Okay,
look leaner than that.

179
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.020
I don't know.
I'm maybe a little self deprecating.
Maybe 15 that's be nice.

180
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.550
Say I'm 15% body fat.

181
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.760
So this guy has 5% less body fat than me and he's going to cut 30 fucking

182
00:10:57.861 --> 00:10:59.870
pounds.
Yeah.
How does a guy do that?

183
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.740
It's through the multistage process.
So when I back up,

184
00:11:03.741 --> 00:11:06.680
when I talk to an athlete or when I talk about weight cutting,
I say number one,

185
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.010
it's not the best case scenario.
Wait,
come.

186
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:13.010
Weight cutting is something that unfortunately has to be done by a lot of

187
00:11:13.011 --> 00:11:17.060
athletes in order to minimize advantage as opposed to gaining an advantage.

188
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.720
But the weight cut should start 52 weeks before competition,

189
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.360
which means it should be a lifestyle.
These athletes,

190
00:11:23.361 --> 00:11:26.210
and this is what they need to understand and hopefully we can spread this

191
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.780
message,
is they need to be training and living and eating and breathing like

192
00:11:29.781 --> 00:11:34.781
professional athletes 365 days out of the year so they can minimize the downside

193
00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.500
of the weight cutting practice.

194
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.950
They need to be eating the proper foods training intelligently,

195
00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:44.951
resting completely so their body's able to endure the grueling practice of

196
00:11:45.501 --> 00:11:46.760
cutting weight.
So with Nick Lens,

197
00:11:46.761 --> 00:11:49.850
he's fresh in the mind right now is just with him in Connecticut last week he

198
00:11:49.851 --> 00:11:54.190
made weight one 46 Charles Allavara his opponent,
he weight by four pounds,

199
00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:58.120
which was absolutely ridiculous.
Unprofessional.
But there's a saying and that,

200
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.470
you know,
the first fight is with the scale.
So the athletes,
when they get to,

201
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.800
you know,
the,
the,
the fight week or when they get the,
the,
the location,

202
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.090
they're focused on the scale.

203
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:09.940
They don't even think about the fight for the most part.
Is that a good thing?

204
00:12:09.941 --> 00:12:13.450
Does it keep them from getting distracted about the fight?
That's,
yeah,

205
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.060
and that's actually a,
uh,

206
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.150
one in the positive benefits of it is that they're not focused on the fight.

207
00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:22.270
They're not burning,
you know,
all that nervous energy thinking about the fight.

208
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.920
But that sets in pretty quick.

209
00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:26.350
As soon as they step off the scale and they have that first face off,

210
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:26.951
in that case,

211
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:30.180
maybe every fighter should have just a really fucking crazy girlfriend,
right.

212
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.830
<v 1>The vans all their time and the only hook up with,</v>

213
00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:36.220
or the week of the fight so that she just demands all your,
you know,

214
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:39.340
your all you fucking care about is what you eat.
You don't even care about me.

215
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:42.940
I'm not even the most important thing to you and just have like the most crazy

216
00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:47.170
narcissistic,
psychotic relationship when the girls should have ridiculous guys.

217
00:12:47.171 --> 00:12:50.560
Wanna check your phone,
check your phone.
Who's fucking touched in you?

218
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.050
You're fucking trainers.
Too little too comfortable with you.

219
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.060
That actually happens.
I'm sure it does.
I'm sure it does.

220
00:12:58.061 --> 00:13:01.450
And for men and for women right now that we have a lot of women in the UFC,

221
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:03.940
I bet it happens for them more.
Sure.

222
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:09.030
I bet guys are more psycho with their popular star women girlfriends,

223
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.970
those fucking weird guys that are in the background that aren't famous and they

224
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:16.840
have famous girlfriends.
Ill mean muggin all the coaches,
partners,

225
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:21.370
all the reporters,
three free press each and every one of them.
Not really.

226
00:13:21.371 --> 00:13:23.320
I don't do whatever you want to do.
Okay.

227
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.540
But the point is that this is a,

228
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.960
this is a genuine issue and it's a genuine physical issue as well as a genuine

229
00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.310
<v 2>logical issue.
Yeah.
And the amazing training camp,
eight week,</v>

230
00:13:34.311 --> 00:13:39.110
12 week training camp can be blown during fight week or the 24 40 hours,

231
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.700
48 hours before they step in the octagon or you know,

232
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.390
in the competition because they blew their weight cut.

233
00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:48.620
And then even if they do make weight,
typically most athletes,
a large majority,

234
00:13:48.621 --> 00:13:51.590
even at the high level,
they blow their rehydration,
they step on weight.

235
00:13:51.591 --> 00:13:52.790
They think,
oh my God,
I made it.

236
00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:56.000
And they grab a sandwich from the Deli or they go and get,
you know,

237
00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:00.740
Pasta Fettuccini Alfredo from the local Italian restaurant and they eat food

238
00:14:00.741 --> 00:14:02.600
that they haven't eaten in weeks or months before.

239
00:14:02.601 --> 00:14:06.260
They totally screw up their digestive system.
Body goes to shit and they,

240
00:14:06.261 --> 00:14:08.270
you know,
they're a shadow of their former selves.

241
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:08.551
<v 1>Well,</v>

242
00:14:08.551 --> 00:14:12.030
I know Chris Leben talked pretty openly about how he did that and one of his

243
00:14:12.031 --> 00:14:15.930
weight cuts,
he ate a bunch of gummy bears.
Yeah.
And he went into shock,

244
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.160
like his body literally like went into like some sort of a sugar shock because

245
00:14:20.161 --> 00:14:21.210
he just couldn't help himself.

246
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.050
<v 2>Yeah.
I live in,</v>

247
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.840
I've known Levinson's Oh four when I started working up at team quest in Oregon.

248
00:14:25.841 --> 00:14:28.960
So I was his coach for a long time,
work with them for a few fights,

249
00:14:28.961 --> 00:14:30.490
not many of the fights recently.

250
00:14:30.491 --> 00:14:33.100
The Vandelay Silva fight was the most recent fight I worked with them.

251
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.000
That was when it was most spectacular victories of all time.
It was,

252
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.390
and that's when he was so motivated.

253
00:14:37.391 --> 00:14:40.870
And that's the Chris I would have loved to have seen in all of his fights

254
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.110
because he was lean,
he was sharp,
he was ready,
he was confident.

255
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.590
He chased away a lot of the demons and a quick leaving story.

256
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.220
So we backup to a fight.
Previous years before that,

257
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.160
and I had lost contact with him,
hadn't seen him in awhile and I'd see him,

258
00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:59.210
I'm with another athlete in the casino.
I see Lieben and he's,
you know,

259
00:14:59.211 --> 00:15:02.630
he's partying and this is right before the fight.
I'm like,
Bro,

260
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.180
how many hours before the flight?
That's like the day before.

261
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:10.000
So he's drinking and he's,
well,
he,
he's,
he's reeking of it,
you know,
I,
yeah,

262
00:15:10.001 --> 00:15:14.420
I partying and whatever,
whatever,
you know you're going to fight.
God,

263
00:15:14.421 --> 00:15:15.230
I don't know.

264
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.660
Hopefully by the end of the show I'll remember who it was and I think he

265
00:15:17.661 --> 00:15:21.920
actually won the fight,
which is insane.
I mean,
I've got multiple leaving stories,

266
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.770
but I was like,
Chris,
what are you doing?
And he's like,

267
00:15:24.771 --> 00:15:28.820
dolce sometimes he's just got a dance with the girl you came with.

268
00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.220
And I was like,
motherfucker.
All right.
All right Chris.
You know,
high five,

269
00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:37.630
good luck.
And I'm pretty positive he did go out there and win that fight.
Oh,

270
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.700
<v 1>I would imagine he did.
He's a wild motherfucker for real.
That's a,</v>

271
00:15:41.701 --> 00:15:45.030
that's a great quote from leaving because that is literally how he got there.

272
00:15:45.031 --> 00:15:46.480
He got there being a wild man.

273
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.550
<v 2>It's exactly what gave him his edge and what got them to the top.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

274
00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:50.260
Is this a weird,
yeah.

275
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.400
<v 1>Maturing process,
isn't it?</v>

276
00:15:51.401 --> 00:15:54.340
For some fighters where they got into fighting because there were so wild and

277
00:15:54.341 --> 00:15:57.640
reckless and somewhere along the line they have to be cautious and calculated.

278
00:15:57.641 --> 00:15:59.950
They have to really think of themselves as pro athletes.

279
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.190
And I say that not just about their training and diet,

280
00:16:03.191 --> 00:16:06.040
but also about their approach to fighting itself.
You know,

281
00:16:06.041 --> 00:16:08.770
I think I'm a huge Forrest Griffin fan.

282
00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.060
I love forest it just as a person and I'm a huge fan of his as a fighter.

283
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:17.530
But I think that one of the best and worst things that ever happened to him was

284
00:16:17.531 --> 00:16:21.150
that fight.
With
that.

285
00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.440
Like I would say it's one of the greatest,
most important fights in MMA,

286
00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.920
but the fight with Stephan Bonner in the finals of the ultimate fighter the

287
00:16:29.921 --> 00:16:32.440
first season,
which was such a crazy fight,

288
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.640
people don't realize how bananas this situation was.

289
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.530
Spike TV was a new network.

290
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.940
It was like some fucking country music channel or something before that,
right?

291
00:16:42.941 --> 00:16:46.450
It,
wasn't it the country station or some shit and it became spike,

292
00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:50.380
which was like a the the guys channel and then they put on this thing,

293
00:16:50.381 --> 00:16:54.220
the ultimate fighter and then,
you know,
people watched it.
It was a good show.

294
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.020
But in the finals,

295
00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:01.230
Stephan Bonner and Forrest Griffin went on it one and it's so hard that the

296
00:17:01.811 --> 00:17:03.490
ratings went through the roof.

297
00:17:03.491 --> 00:17:07.990
Like they can monitor the ratings while the fights going on.
And it went from,

298
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:08.501
you know,

299
00:17:08.501 --> 00:17:12.220
like a million people watching it when first started to like 10 million people

300
00:17:12.221 --> 00:17:14.110
at its peak,
which is insane,

301
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.860
which they can track is directly related to people calling each other up and go

302
00:17:17.861 --> 00:17:18.670
and dude,

303
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.540
you got to fucking see this turn on channel two 48 these motherfuckers are

304
00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:23.380
throwing down.

305
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.700
And then people started calling each other and then the see through the fight as

306
00:17:27.701 --> 00:17:31.930
the,
it was a while fives because you got two guys who knew each other super well

307
00:17:31.931 --> 00:17:33.430
trained together for,
you know,

308
00:17:33.431 --> 00:17:36.760
the six weeks they were in the house and then went to war.

309
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.190
And they were so evenly matched that it was,

310
00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.090
there was no winner in that fight at the end.
Forrest Griffin one,

311
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.890
he got the decision,
but it was so close that we,

312
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.820
we actually talked about it inside the cage.
I said,

313
00:17:48.821 --> 00:17:51.890
why don't you give you the both these guys a fucking contract?
And they would,

314
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.970
and they talked about it and Lorenzo and Dan like,

315
00:17:53.971 --> 00:17:58.230
let's get both these guys a fucking contract.
And then boom,
they both got this,

316
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.180
this big six figure contract with the UFC.

317
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:05.181
But that kind of style was so rewarded that it became how Stephan Bonner fought.

318
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:11.040
Sure.
And I think he's,
he's,
you know,
he's still kind of fights like that.

319
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.290
Um,
but as Forrest Griffin,

320
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.380
I think that it turned out to be his downfall in a lot of ways.

321
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.350
Like this face for charging aggressive style.

322
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.340
And that's how he lost to Keith Jardeen.
And that's,
you know,

323
00:18:23.341 --> 00:18:27.990
I believe like the more strategic Forrest Griffin was the one who beat Shogun.

324
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.030
Yeah.
You know,
he,
he made some calculations,

325
00:18:30.031 --> 00:18:33.570
he made some adjust adjustments in his career,
but that,

326
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.550
that style that he like,

327
00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:39.690
he learned how to be this wild reckless motherfucker because that was so

328
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:40.470
rewarding.

329
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:41.660
<v 2>Exactly.
Now,
yeah.</v>

330
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.230
And it's hard for an athlete sometimes to change their natural instinct,

331
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.900
I think.
And you see that in the gym where an athlete,

332
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:53.070
either they're very tentative and calculating when they first get into the gym

333
00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:55.380
and they kind of have to bring out that monster a little bit,

334
00:18:55.381 --> 00:18:59.400
learn to be a finisher and they tend to look a little bit boring and maybe like

335
00:18:59.401 --> 00:19:03.240
an underachiever where you get a guy like forest or leaving that goes out there

336
00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:06.840
and they just go balls to the wall throwing big shots and sometimes they get

337
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:09.720
knocked out and sometimes they get their hand raised and the,

338
00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.390
you have to walk that fine line and you know,

339
00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:14.550
unfortunately they're playing with their brains,
you know,

340
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:16.350
they're putting all of their going all in,
you know,
every,

341
00:19:16.351 --> 00:19:18.660
every fight they're going all in and they don't know how they're going to walk

342
00:19:18.661 --> 00:19:21.090
out of it.
Um,
so it's really interesting.

343
00:19:21.091 --> 00:19:24.000
It's interesting to see how far the sport's evolved.
I mean,

344
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.670
every couple of years is sport evolves to a brand new level.

345
00:19:26.671 --> 00:19:31.380
You see these young kids coming in now that are better equipped and better

346
00:19:31.381 --> 00:19:35.160
skilled than the champions of 10 years ago.
Glenn,
they're not even contenders.

347
00:19:35.161 --> 00:19:37.940
Yeah.
They're not even outside the top 20.
Right?
Yeah.

348
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:38.271
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

349
00:19:38.271 --> 00:19:42.140
There's guys that are just coming up that are 21 years old that have a better

350
00:19:42.141 --> 00:19:46.280
skillset than world champions of 10 years ago.
Yeah.
It's amazing.
Insanity.

351
00:19:46.281 --> 00:19:47.720
It is amazing.
Um,

352
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:52.460
one of the issues when it comes to weight cutting and rehydration or dehydration

353
00:19:52.461 --> 00:19:54.380
rather is head trauma.
Yeah.

354
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:59.560
And it's one of the reasons why rehydrating with an IV is so critical because if

355
00:20:01.191 --> 00:20:02.360
you look at boxing,

356
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:06.730
the majority of the instances of men suffering,
uh,

357
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.540
in fight brain damage,
Gerald Mcclellan,
Duk Koo,
Kim,

358
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.920
like there's a lot of these cases in almost all of them involves someone weight

359
00:20:15.921 --> 00:20:16.754
cutting.
Yup.

360
00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:21.890
And because of that boxing and now MMA has adjusted schedule where the fighters

361
00:20:21.891 --> 00:20:25.010
way in the day before where they used to weigh in the day of the match,

362
00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.830
old school boxing matches,
you would see them way in the day of the match,
they,

363
00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.030
and they would still cut weight and then they would try to rehydrate and they

364
00:20:32.031 --> 00:20:35.750
didn't know what the fuck they were doing back then.
And guys had dry brains.

365
00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.970
I mean,
literally.
Yep.
And because of that,

366
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:42.350
made them more susceptible to cerebral hemorrhages and brain damage and all

367
00:20:42.351 --> 00:20:43.720
sorts of different things.
Uh,

368
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:48.790
very few heavyweight fighters suffered from brain in,
in an actual fight.

369
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.950
It was usually,
you know,
years and years of repeated head trauma that got them,

370
00:20:53.951 --> 00:20:57.620
but not like one event,
like a general McClellan event.
Sure.
And,
uh,

371
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.470
for folks who don't know,
Gerald McClellan was,

372
00:20:59.471 --> 00:21:03.730
he was one of the great light heavyweights of,
uh,

373
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:04.790
while he was a,

374
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.150
he was a light heavyweight and he was a super middleweight as well.
It was,
um,

375
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.700
and he was one of the guys who was eventually gonna fight.

376
00:21:12.701 --> 00:21:16.000
Roy Jones Jr fought Nigel Benn in,
uh,
you know,

377
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:20.890
an epic contest had been really badly hurt.
They collided heads,

378
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:21.580
uh,

379
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:26.230
and he was all fucked up and he went back to his corner and he took a knee and

380
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.510
wound up bowing out of the fight and then immediately went into a coma.
And,
uh,

381
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.700
had some horrible,
horrible brain injuries because of that.

382
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.590
And that was a fight that,
uh,

383
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.510
changed a lot of people's ideas about a weight cutting and about the dangers of

384
00:21:40.511 --> 00:21:43.060
head trauma.
Because before that fight,

385
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.470
Gerald Mcclellan was taught to be like an invincible destroyer.
I mean,

386
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:49.700
people had seen him,
he was just knocking everybody out.

387
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.910
He was one of the crunk stars,

388
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.200
Cronk boxing being a manual Stuart's team that produced Tommy Hearns.

389
00:21:56.201 --> 00:21:57.820
And you know,
so many great,

390
00:21:57.821 --> 00:22:01.240
great fighters came out of that gym and they all were just assassins.

391
00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:04.240
And he was one of the best.
Gerald McClellan was a fucking vicious,

392
00:22:04.241 --> 00:22:08.620
vicious killer.
And,
uh,
everybody had to wash that.
And,
uh,
you know,

393
00:22:08.621 --> 00:22:10.210
and he's still alive to this day.

394
00:22:10.211 --> 00:22:15.211
He's blind and he's all fucked up and sad shit directly related to dehydration,

395
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.860
<v 2>right?
Yeah.
Hydration.
I would say so.
I mean,
it certainly contributed,
right?
It,</v>

396
00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:24.660
it assisted in the,
uh,
the damage and that's something that I pound,

397
00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:25.620
you know,
my,

398
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:30.540
my soapbox when I talk to athletes when I talked to anybody is about help you

399
00:22:30.541 --> 00:22:33.240
gotta be healthy.
If you're not healthy,
you can't perform.
You can't compete.

400
00:22:33.241 --> 00:22:35.850
If your body is healthy,
then you can do absolutely anything.

401
00:22:35.851 --> 00:22:37.050
It'll do anything you ask of it.

402
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:41.370
If you maintain its health for a long period of time,
not just fight week,

403
00:22:41.371 --> 00:22:43.320
not just start eating organic and green fight week.

404
00:22:43.321 --> 00:22:45.360
When you start cutting weight or two or three weeks beforehand,

405
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.700
it has to be before training camp even starts.

406
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.920
You have to be eating a lot of food,

407
00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:54.510
the proper food at the right times consistently get your body weight down to a,

408
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.760
you know,
a,
your body mass down to a solid ratio.

409
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.120
Somewhere around that 10% range.
If you're a male mixed martial arts for females,

410
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.980
anywhere between 18 20%,
let's say

411
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:07.390
<v 1>dip below 10% is that dangerous?</v>

412
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.160
<v 2>It's not,
but that's really for competition time because like with,</v>

413
00:23:10.161 --> 00:23:12.030
with lance and all my,
all my male athletes,

414
00:23:12.031 --> 00:23:15.120
I try and keep them right around 10% the bigger guys,

415
00:23:15.121 --> 00:23:17.400
maybe we get a little closer to the 12% the littler guys,

416
00:23:17.401 --> 00:23:20.790
a leaner guys maybe you know between eight and 10 but right around 10 is the

417
00:23:20.791 --> 00:23:21.624
sweet spot.

418
00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:25.170
So we keep them around 10 that means they have weight to work off because they

419
00:23:25.171 --> 00:23:28.590
need that for the first few phases.
When I work with training camps and such,

420
00:23:28.591 --> 00:23:31.500
we break the training camp down in the multiple three week phases so we can

421
00:23:31.501 --> 00:23:35.040
actually go through the proper training protocols and then peak towards the very

422
00:23:35.041 --> 00:23:39.200
end.
So we can deal with the rigors of the training,
the bumps,
the bruises,

423
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.260
the bangs of slams.

424
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.520
We have the extra body fat to kind of insulate us so we can keep our joints and

425
00:23:44.521 --> 00:23:45.980
ligaments strong and pliable.

426
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:49.820
<v 3>Um,
so body extra body fat actually does that.
It does,
absolutely it does.</v>

427
00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:53.060
It's just another layer of insulation when you're constantly grinding on guys

428
00:23:53.061 --> 00:23:56.390
and being,
you know,
wrenched against the wall and picked up and slammed,
you know,

429
00:23:56.391 --> 00:23:59.030
50 times because you're drilling,
whatever move you need,

430
00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:02.390
that little bit of insulation,
the leaner you get,
the dryer your joints get,

431
00:24:02.391 --> 00:24:06.020
the more susceptible to injury you become.
So is that a scientific fact,

432
00:24:06.021 --> 00:24:10.160
like your joints get dryer when you're leaner,
when you're leaner?
Absolutely.
Huh.

433
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.220
How does that work?
I mean,
is there a fat in between your joints?

434
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:18.230
I'm not gonna I don't think I can speak intelligently enough to break down the

435
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:22.450
true science of it,
but it's something that certainly remains a,

436
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:26.120
I know when I was a power lifter we would increase our body fat in order to

437
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:30.140
increase the leverage points within our joints.
So you can have,
um,
you know,

438
00:24:30.141 --> 00:24:33.920
when I was a a power lift out and intentionally increase my body fat to like,

439
00:24:33.921 --> 00:24:38.030
you know,
15,
18% and my numbers would absolutely go through the roof.

440
00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.260
I would get less joint pain,
less injuries.
So call it,
you know,
bro Science,

441
00:24:42.261 --> 00:24:45.350
if some people like to throw that term around there,
but you just feel better,

442
00:24:45.351 --> 00:24:48.950
feel stronger and the leaner you get specifically when you start heading into

443
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.770
the peaking phase,
which is now mild dehydration,

444
00:24:51.771 --> 00:24:55.610
as we get closer to fight week sets in,
the entire body becomes drier.

445
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.400
So there's less,
less tricity within the muscles.

446
00:24:58.401 --> 00:25:02.990
You're more susceptible to those,
um,
injuries,
overuse injuries and such.

447
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.030
Bro,
science is a very tricky word,
right?
It's,
yeah,
absolutely.
It's fucking,

448
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.160
it's,
it's very limiting.

449
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.630
Like they hit you with that bro Science and they gotcha as if it's an
accusation,

450
00:25:14.631 --> 00:25:16.330
but I don't,
it's almost a,

451
00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:20.330
it means experience unless you're just throwing shit at the wall.

452
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.550
But there's a lot of throwing shit at the wall too.
I think more,

453
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.950
more than the experience.
You know,

454
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:28.670
there's certain like things that you would say maybe would be bro Science that

455
00:25:28.671 --> 00:25:32.250
turned out to be like legit,
like,
um,
things along the line.

456
00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.640
It's like we want to talk about experience,

457
00:25:34.641 --> 00:25:38.240
things like ancient training methods that have turned out to be the right way to

458
00:25:38.241 --> 00:25:42.560
do it.
Like all those old school rocky methods and everyone rocky was training in

459
00:25:42.561 --> 00:25:45.680
Siberia and he was running through the snow and dragging logs.

460
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.160
A lot of times people would,
if it wasn't for all the data that we have now,

461
00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.910
people would consider that kind of bro Science cause that's like,
you know,

462
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.240
oh you don't fucking have to chop logs.
You'd dummy.
Actually,

463
00:25:56.241 --> 00:25:59.020
it's a really good way to exercise.
So literally,
you know,

464
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.550
but for the longest time most people thought no,

465
00:26:01.551 --> 00:26:04.830
you had to use a nautilus machine and you had a fucking do everything.

466
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.090
Dre Go with the fucking heart monitors and all that stuff.

467
00:26:08.091 --> 00:26:11.060
That computers hooked up to him.
But Bro,
science is a nice way.

468
00:26:11.061 --> 00:26:13.370
They can shut you down and make you look stupid.
I know.

469
00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.800
It's fucking pisses me off because I get this shit all the time.
You know,

470
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:20.300
everyone's always growling.
You're a bro.
I'm a bro.
And even a bro,

471
00:26:20.301 --> 00:26:23.810
like you could call someone a bro and you limit there any,

472
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.760
anything that they have to say?

473
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.030
Anything they have to say about culture or anything they have to say about

474
00:26:29.031 --> 00:26:33.380
society?
Any opinions,
any thoughts,
any philosophies they might have.

475
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:37.820
You're a bro Bro.
And that's,
I will wear that proudly,
but it's,

476
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.980
we're evidence based so we can say evidence-based Bro Science that,
you know,

477
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.160
don't do anything unless

478
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.760
<v 4>it's been proven.
If we have a concept or an idea.
And I,
you know,</v>

479
00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:50.250
obviously in my office I have a team that works with me,

480
00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:53.550
so it's not just me and the black and gold shirt running around.
I have a team,

481
00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:58.140
I've,
you know,
employees that have um,
degrees,
masters in exercise physiology.

482
00:26:58.141 --> 00:26:59.580
I've registered dieticians on staff,

483
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.170
so it's a complete team within the dolce diet that puts this information out

484
00:27:04.171 --> 00:27:05.550
there and looks after the athletes.

485
00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:08.460
So it's not just me running around with my stop watching my clipboard handed

486
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:11.730
people bottles of water.
So it truly is a scientific process,

487
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:14.280
but it's also based upon the experience.

488
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.460
And I've been doing this for 25 years,
you know,

489
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:21.300
since shit 93 professionally getting paid to do this.

490
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.730
And I have tremendous amounts of data.

491
00:27:23.731 --> 00:27:27.660
I have almost all the data I've ever had collected on athletes and students and

492
00:27:27.661 --> 00:27:28.550
clients that I've worked with.

493
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:32.820
<v 1>Anecdotal data as well.
Athletes telling you how good they feel good after,</v>

494
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.370
what did they,
it makes them feel bad.

495
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.070
<v 4>Yep.
What did they eat today?
What did they waited?</v>

496
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.300
They were their bowel movements.
What was the training systems like?

497
00:27:38.301 --> 00:27:40.400
When did they get sick?
What's your sense of humor like?

498
00:27:40.401 --> 00:27:42.800
I mean I speak with the wives.
I speak with the husbands,

499
00:27:42.801 --> 00:27:44.690
I speak with the coaches.
I speak with the training partners.

500
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.290
I know everything about the athlete,
the time they wake up,

501
00:27:48.291 --> 00:27:51.380
the time they have that bowel movement,
all the way through the day.

502
00:27:51.381 --> 00:27:53.750
I know the intensity of the training and of the volume and the training under

503
00:27:53.751 --> 00:27:56.960
the amount of rounds that they put in.
I know there,
you know,
caloric breakdown.

504
00:27:56.961 --> 00:27:58.400
I know their lean mass ratios.

505
00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.800
Oftentimes I know what their blood work looks like.

506
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:05.090
We have a lot of data and based upon this data is how we come up with our

507
00:28:05.091 --> 00:28:08.750
methodology and how we continue to evolve.
Because every time,

508
00:28:08.751 --> 00:28:11.360
I mean it's like every week you see me at the UFC is quite often,

509
00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.180
well that's not just,
I'm not sure throwing shit at the wall.

510
00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.780
I'm taking what I did on Friday,
Saturday of that weekend.
On Sunday,

511
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.840
I'm looking at the numbers and I'm retooling it because Monday I'm going to

512
00:28:20.841 --> 00:28:24.560
another fight week somewhere and we're continuing to evolve this process as we

513
00:28:24.561 --> 00:28:26.180
move forward.
So we,
it,
it's,

514
00:28:26.181 --> 00:28:31.181
it's evidence based scientific principles that's also battle tested and proven

515
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:36.290
viable with experience because there's a lot of science out there that,
you know,

516
00:28:36.291 --> 00:28:38.420
the,
the guys in the suits in the lab coats,

517
00:28:38.421 --> 00:28:40.250
they're going to point to and say that's the way they do it.

518
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.580
But they've never actually done it in the human element.

519
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.140
They've never actually seen it work.

520
00:28:45.141 --> 00:28:47.810
They just sit in the classroom and they talk about it and they pontificate on
it.

521
00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:52.640
But it's never truly been proven in the real world.
And that's what we do also.

522
00:28:52.641 --> 00:28:53.840
So we have the benefit of that.

523
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.170
Plus we have the benefit of all the scientific evidence.

524
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:58.820
That's that that's out there also.

525
00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:00.910
And that's kind of what we wrote roll into this also

526
00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:04.390
<v 1>makes and MMA are so much higher than the stakes in any other sport when it</v>

527
00:29:04.391 --> 00:29:07.660
comes to proven concepts in the real world in quotes,

528
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:10.150
because the real world and MMA you're,

529
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.000
you're fucking consciousness is on the line.
Your health isn't the line.

530
00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:17.140
Your body is getting get hit by things that would ordinarily,

531
00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.510
like if you were in uh,

532
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.930
any sort of a real life situation and someone kicked you in the head,

533
00:29:22.931 --> 00:29:24.940
that person would go to jail.
Meanwhile,

534
00:29:24.941 --> 00:29:27.820
in this scenario they're rewarded for being able to kick you in the head.

535
00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.520
They got a bonus,
they get a fucking bed jet bonus.
Yeah,

536
00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:34.450
they get a k o the night when that's its performance of the night now.
But um,

537
00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.840
do you think,
and this is a really touchy subject,

538
00:29:37.841 --> 00:29:39.250
but I think it's an important one to bring up.

539
00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:44.580
Do you think that a lot our ideas about what's physically possible when it comes

540
00:29:45.071 --> 00:29:50.071
to training and when it comes to fighting are distorted because of performance

541
00:29:50.441 --> 00:29:54.230
enhancing drugs?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
I think performance enhancing drugs,

542
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:59.280
drugs have set the bar in all sports,
in,

543
00:29:59.281 --> 00:30:02.860
in a culture,
whether it's looking at the movies,
looking at the magazine,
cover,

544
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:06.160
track and field track and field everywhere.
Golf,
Nascar,

545
00:30:06.161 --> 00:30:10.030
anywhere you look that there's money on the line where you get rewarded for

546
00:30:10.031 --> 00:30:13.870
performance.
There's some sort of ancillary,
you know,

547
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.670
good or you know,

548
00:30:15.671 --> 00:30:19.510
commodity being used or purchased or consumed to improve your performance

549
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:20.321
specific.

550
00:30:20.321 --> 00:30:23.200
It's very evident in the world of mixed martial arts because these guys and

551
00:30:23.201 --> 00:30:26.630
girls are getting punched and kicked in the head in there losing consciousness

552
00:30:26.631 --> 00:30:28.990
and they're breaking bones and getting limbs torn off.

553
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:34.000
So now you have these advanced superhumans out.
They're able to,

554
00:30:34.001 --> 00:30:38.470
you know,
rip joints and,
and punch brains and do all these other things.
So it,

555
00:30:38.471 --> 00:30:43.330
it does,
I think the odds are much greater,

556
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.170
you know,
for the risk is certainly much greater for anybody who competes.
Yeah.

557
00:30:47.171 --> 00:30:51.160
That's where I took exception to a lot of people saying like,

558
00:30:51.161 --> 00:30:53.470
who cares if someone juices,
you know,
I don't give a fuck.

559
00:30:53.471 --> 00:30:55.030
I'm gonna kick their ass anyway.
You're like,

560
00:30:55.031 --> 00:30:58.450
Chris Weidman said that about Vito Belfort and I appreciate the fact that he

561
00:30:58.451 --> 00:31:01.900
thinks that way cause he's a champion and that's how the champion feels.
Yeah.

562
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:07.230
But the reality is there are punches that can be landed when you are on EPO and

563
00:31:09.281 --> 00:31:13.120
test and Jack to the fucking gills and whatever the fuck else you're doing that

564
00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:16.150
you wouldn't have the energy to land in a normal scenario.

565
00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:21.390
Like it's very rare that a guy can do like what Tj Dillashaw does and go balls

566
00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:24.370
to the walls for five fucking rounds.
Yeah.

567
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:29.230
Tj can do it as a natural athlete because he's got a fucking tireless work

568
00:31:29.231 --> 00:31:34.210
ethic.
He's unbelievably dedicated and focused and he's 145 pounds.

569
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.190
Yeah.
That's another big factor.
Huge.

570
00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:39.660
The difference between that and a guy like Overeem.
Yeah.

571
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:43.240
Who Alster Overeem came into the UFC against Brock Lesnar.

572
00:31:43.241 --> 00:31:46.450
He was two 65 shredded to the tits,

573
00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.300
looked like a fucking superhero out of a comic book.

574
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.170
Pissed hot and has never been the same guy again.
Yeah.

575
00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:57.220
And that's the reality is now he's being tested.
He shrunk,
he'd lost body mass.

576
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:02.090
Is it just seems to affect a guy's chin as well.
The the,

577
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:05.020
the thing about taking performance enhancing drugs is it,

578
00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:08.500
it doesn't just seem to affect your cardio,

579
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:12.100
but it seems to also affect your ability to take a shot.
Yeah,

580
00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:14.020
we saw that in Mark Hunt versus big foot,

581
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:19.800
big foot Silva and Mark Hunt had one of the greatest heavyweight fights ever as

582
00:32:19.931 --> 00:32:23.020
far as like from a fan's perspective,
like watching an entertaining fight.

583
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.700
What a fucking war.

584
00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:29.470
These guys went to a war and big foot absorbed everything that Mark Hunt hit him

585
00:32:29.471 --> 00:32:33.070
with one of the greatest knockout artists in the history of kickboxing and MMA.

586
00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.070
Hey,
mark Hunt's awesome.
He's a monster.
Big Foot absorbed it.

587
00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:41.340
They tested them after the fight and he apparently he tested before the fight.

588
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:44.060
Thought that was it.
I don't have to worry about this anymore.

589
00:32:44.061 --> 00:32:46.180
And they jacked him with a fucking giant hit.

590
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:50.330
Like they took a fucking big gulp full of test and just shoved it right in his

591
00:32:50.331 --> 00:32:51.164
ass.

592
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:56.570
He was just fucking just completely juiced up when he fought his,

593
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:59.600
his levels were through the roof after the fight.

594
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.570
And because of that he was able to absorb.

595
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.540
I mean I'm speculating as to why he was able to absorb those shots,

596
00:33:05.541 --> 00:33:08.090
but I've got to think that it has something to do with it.

597
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.570
It definitely increases aggression.
It increases tenacity.

598
00:33:11.571 --> 00:33:15.590
It brings out that killer instinct and maybe an athlete in that state,

599
00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:20.060
they can walk through punches more because they have more of that primal urge

600
00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:23.720
and instinct and those elevated hormones pumping through their body because

601
00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:27.680
that's really what testosterone does and God knows what else is out there.

602
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:27.980
I mean,

603
00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:32.510
I don't even think we're aware in this room of all the drugs and performance

604
00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:34.430
enhancers that are truly out there and these,
you know,

605
00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:38.720
evil geniuses around the world are creating and sticking into the athletes and

606
00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.970
putting them back out there to see what the effect is.

607
00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:45.260
No big foot got popped on a simple urine test,

608
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:50.350
which is quite fascinating because the UFC has taken a lot of flack about their

609
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.550
stance on performance enhancing drugs and people like,
oh,
it's just lip service.

610
00:33:55.551 --> 00:33:59.600
UFC doesn't give a shit.
This is how much the UFC gives a shit.

611
00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:03.770
They've tested all of their best athletes with blood tests in a way that is

612
00:34:03.771 --> 00:34:05.840
fucked up.
A lot of performances,

613
00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:10.730
like they've stepped in and it costs more than $40,000 every time they do this.

614
00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.980
So every single athletes,

615
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:17.090
they're doing this outside of the jurisdiction of the athletic commissions.

616
00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:20.060
So the athletic commissions has their own specific protocol for how they

617
00:34:20.061 --> 00:34:24.370
testified her.
Then the UFC steps in and brings in like the,

618
00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:28.910
the highest,
most stringent Olympic testing that they can find.
You know,

619
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:32.810
they bring in the best guys that not only that they have a chain of command,

620
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.530
they have a chain of evidence rather of um,
uh,

621
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.670
possession where like say if you have Mike Dolce comes to the gym and you test

622
00:34:40.671 --> 00:34:45.500
Jamie,
you fucking carry that shit on a plane to wherever the lab is.

623
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:48.830
Like you have it in your possession.
It never leaves you.
When you take a shit,

624
00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:50.870
that fucking suitcase sits right in front of you.

625
00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.360
Nobody can come into your hotel room,
grab it.
No,

626
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:58.400
it goes directly from your hands to the lab.
They ha they are very,

627
00:34:58.401 --> 00:35:00.140
very,
very specific about that.

628
00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.590
The reason being is because there's no shenanigans with these blood tests.

629
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:07.580
And because of that,
a guy like Chael Sonnen got popped for EPO,

630
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:11.510
elevated levels of test,
human growth hormone,
all this,
I mean he's got,

631
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.430
he's been popped for a bunch of different things.

632
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.770
Actually the elevated test was the urine thing,

633
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:18.910
but when they got him with the blood,
they found him with all,

634
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.940
they've got him with some anti,
uh,

635
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.620
there's some thing that they use for fertility.
They hit,
he was,
uh,

636
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:27.170
he was on Clomid,
which is what you,
uh,

637
00:35:27.171 --> 00:35:32.060
you take when they take you off of human growth hormone or testosterone to try

638
00:35:32.061 --> 00:35:36.890
to restart your body system.
It's,
everyone's a fucking chemical factory.

639
00:35:36.891 --> 00:35:37.980
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

640
00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:40.890
<v 3>It's not everyone,
obviously it's some,
it's some,</v>

641
00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:45.480
and I think it's a smaller percentage than a lot of the articles and interviews

642
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.850
come out with,
you know,
a lot of athletes out.

643
00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:51.450
There's 90% of the guys who are 50%.
That's what he,

644
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:54.630
one of his famous statements after he got caught,
he's like,

645
00:35:54.631 --> 00:35:58.410
everyone's using in camp.
Everyone.
It depends on which camp is talking about,

646
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.540
you know,
cause there's,
I know that there's,

647
00:36:00.541 --> 00:36:03.660
there's a ton of great athletes out there.
Ronda Rousey's,
one of them,
you know,

648
00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:05.880
lifelong drug free athlete,
Johny Hendricks,
he's one of them.

649
00:36:05.881 --> 00:36:10.440
Nick Lens is one of the Penn.
Bj Penn is one of them.
Um,
there's John Fitch,

650
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.730
John Fitch is one of them.
So there's a,
there's a lot of them,

651
00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:17.520
huge list of top tier athletes that are clean and lifelong clean and we have no

652
00:36:17.521 --> 00:36:19.030
reason to suspect otherwise.
Right.

653
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:23.040
And they beat the piss out of a lot of the ped users.
But you know,

654
00:36:23.041 --> 00:36:26.460
to the guys and girls that are using these,
maybe they wouldn't be a top five,

655
00:36:26.461 --> 00:36:28.900
top 10,
top 20 even.
Maybe they wouldn't even make an interview view.

656
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:33.660
See if not for some sort of enhancement.
I would love to go back to pride.

657
00:36:33.661 --> 00:36:37.110
The pride days.
I'm a huge pride fans or don't get me wrong,

658
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.540
some of my greatest moments as a fan,
as an MMA fan,
absolutely.
Watching the,

659
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:47.160
just the best fights of pride fade or versus Cro cop.
Well,

660
00:36:47.161 --> 00:36:50.940
he's just absorbing every shot cro cop hits him with and plowing forward and

661
00:36:50.941 --> 00:36:54.360
blasting him fade or beat cro cop in a fucking kickboxing about.

662
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:55.590
So a lot of people don't realize.

663
00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:00.350
And fader was the first guy that ever made me want to be fat.
He make that sexy,

664
00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:04.770
didn't it?
Bald bastard beat the fuck out of everybody with this floppy gut.
Yup.

665
00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:06.840
You know,
and I'm like this motherfucker,

666
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:10.890
he was kicking everybody's ass and he looks like he looks like he just stepped

667
00:37:10.891 --> 00:37:14.030
out of his fucking station wagon and waddled onto the beach,
you know,

668
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.160
to play volleyball with some friends.
He always,

669
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:21.180
he was much bigger actually early in his career.
And then as he got older,

670
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.890
he lost a lot of body mass,
a lot of muscle mass.
But man,

671
00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:28.800
I would love to see what those guys were actually doing.
And in pride,

672
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:29.940
I mean that's almost,

673
00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.750
it's almost a gentleman's agreement that you're agreeing to compete on drugs

674
00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:36.720
because that was in the contracts.
You know,
when we saw that pretty recently,

675
00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:40.200
and I had known some guys back in the day that it said that's in the contract

676
00:37:40.201 --> 00:37:41.620
and like,
are you fucking kidding me?
What?

677
00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:46.140
Ensign came on the podcast and he read it off to us and sanity.

678
00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:48.270
But in that case,

679
00:37:48.271 --> 00:37:51.360
if you're going to sign that contract and then you're loaded up to the gills,

680
00:37:51.361 --> 00:37:54.810
I'm not going to sit here and judge morally because you're agreeing to those

681
00:37:54.811 --> 00:37:57.510
rules.
Right.
It's like kicks to the face on the ground.
Okay.

682
00:37:57.511 --> 00:37:59.160
If you're going to agree to it,
you know,

683
00:37:59.161 --> 00:38:02.190
but in the UFC here where there's unified rules,
you know,

684
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.850
it's a whole nother bar ballgame.
Well,
when Jason Chambers was a trainee,

685
00:38:05.851 --> 00:38:08.460
a 10th planet,
he went over,
he was fighting in Japan.

686
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:09.660
I won't even say the organization,

687
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.930
but they wanted him to fight at one 85 and Jason's like,

688
00:38:12.931 --> 00:38:16.350
I walk around like one 70 like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

689
00:38:16.351 --> 00:38:18.870
Like I want to fight one 55 no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

690
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:23.190
You're going to get on steroid much legit.
Oh Wow.

691
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.800
They wanted him to get on roids.
They literally told him to get on roids league,

692
00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:31.680
Japanese legal over there.
I mean,
is that just culturally it's not an issue?

693
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.380
I don't think they give a fuck about that.
They just looked at him,

694
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.250
you know Jason's a handsome bastard

695
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:38.350
<v 1>and they sell like this fucking beautiful bastard.</v>

696
00:38:38.351 --> 00:38:41.920
We need some muscles on this motherfucker to sell,
sell,
sell south.
No,

697
00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:45.100
you can't have a guy looking like nick Diaz kicking everybody's ass with a

698
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:46.630
normal athlete looking body.

699
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:50.890
You want to Kevin Randleman looking fucking Jason Chambers with Kevin Randleman,

700
00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:52.150
his muscles.
Jesus Christ.

701
00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:55.240
How much could we sell that Dan put that guy on a fucking cover,
put up,

702
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:58.270
put a banana.
Whereas Dick is stuffing in his underwear.

703
00:38:58.271 --> 00:39:03.220
So we an athletes super.
Yeah,

704
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:07.420
but they literally told him,
I mean from his voice to my ears,

705
00:39:07.421 --> 00:39:10.240
they told him and we were friends.
We still are friends.
He,

706
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.750
they told him to do steroids.
Oh Shit.
So they do,
I mean,

707
00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.980
and there was always speculation.
Like we would look at Vandelay and we'd go,
how,

708
00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.730
how do you,
how,
how,
how have you built like that?
How was that?

709
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:25.900
How can a guy be built like that and go to war for 10 minutes at 10 minute round

710
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:30.610
and just never get tired?
Like how is that possible?
It's not right.
It's

711
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.930
<v 2>very rare.</v>

712
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.080
Those are the outliers that are able to look like that and compete like that.

713
00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:38.560
And I spent some time with Brian Stan and he just telling story about how when

714
00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:42.550
he went to Japan and flaws it Japan or China and fought Manderlay and he's like,

715
00:39:42.551 --> 00:39:45.880
I'm flying on a flight.
I'm sucked out,
I'm dehydrated,
I'm cutting weight.

716
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:51.180
And I show up and I see Vander Lee and he is just fucking jacked and veiny and

717
00:39:52.241 --> 00:39:55.840
like smiling and just spit and piss and vinegar.
And he's like,

718
00:39:55.841 --> 00:39:59.320
that's when I knew,
I knew he was fucking gassed up and you know,

719
00:39:59.321 --> 00:40:01.810
and then you'd go out there and the fight goes how it is.
And it was,

720
00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.130
they got fight performance in the knife,
fight of the night,
whatever,
you know.

721
00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:07.810
And Vandelay had a very good chin on that night because Stan draw,
you know,

722
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.380
hit him with big shots and back and forth that went and unfortunately Stan was

723
00:40:11.381 --> 00:40:12.850
the the guy to fall down first.

724
00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.480
<v 1>Yeah,
it is that thing your,</v>

725
00:40:14.481 --> 00:40:19.481
your ability to absorb punishment actually changes depending upon what your on

726
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:23.090
it seems to be.
It seems to be,
I mean we're,
we're talking,

727
00:40:23.091 --> 00:40:26.270
we're kind of speculating.
Obviously we don't have the evidence in front of us.

728
00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.890
So science.
Yeah,
we're bro Science and shit.

729
00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:35.360
Spit stand reasonably accused Kung Lee of being on performance enhancing drugs

730
00:40:35.361 --> 00:40:40.070
after he fought Michael Bisping.
Yeah.
And that's,
you don't no evidence,

731
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:44.960
no evidence other than a photo.
But that photo was pretty fucking interesting.

732
00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:47.860
It,
well it's interesting because kingly was,

733
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:50.180
is 40 but you know,

734
00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:54.680
in Congress defense he said that he had had a series of aggravating injuries and

735
00:40:54.681 --> 00:40:57.680
this was the first camp where he had had surgeries,

736
00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.400
had fixed up all those injuries and he went on a pretty rigorous strength and

737
00:41:01.401 --> 00:41:05.160
conditioning regime shore for that,
for that training camp.
Like,

738
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:09.050
you can't definitely say that he was on something and he didn't test piss hot

739
00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.510
and that's it.
So I mean,
I don't know,

740
00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:16.190
<v 2>and it's,
it's a tough call because then we're just kind of being haters like,</v>

741
00:41:16.191 --> 00:41:20.060
Oh yeah dude,
he looks fucking great at 40 and like,
well I don't look that good.

742
00:41:20.061 --> 00:41:22.850
So he must be on juice and there's that human element to it.

743
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:27.440
But if he doesn't piss hot,
I mean,
how can we accuse and blame,

744
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:31.280
you know him of doing something wrong when he didn't and it didn't affect his

745
00:41:31.281 --> 00:41:34.190
performance in a positive manner anyway because it's being went out there

746
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.920
<v 1>and beat his ass,
beat his ass.
Damn Bisbing look good enough.
Fight.</v>

747
00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.460
That was fucking awesome.
Version of Bisping we've ever seen.

748
00:41:40.461 --> 00:41:43.780
Bisping's a tenacious motherfucker.
He's a mean motherfucker.

749
00:41:43.781 --> 00:41:48.080
He's just tenacious and Shit,
man.
He's just still in the mix still,

750
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:52.160
you know,
still believing that one day he's going to be the champion.

751
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:56.780
I was just going to keep fucking chipping away.
He gets beat,
he comes back,

752
00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.940
you know,
and to,
in his defense,

753
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:03.360
everyone that's beaten him as essentially been popped for steroids.
Yeah.

754
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.710
Dan Henderson who knocked him out,
wasn't popped for steroids,

755
00:42:06.711 --> 00:42:10.700
but he was on a legal version of testosterone replacement therapy before they

756
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:13.840
outlawed that stuff,
which I think is a good thing to outlaw it.

757
00:42:13.841 --> 00:42:18.470
And this is coming from a person who takes testosterone.
I'm a,
I'm 47 years old.

758
00:42:18.471 --> 00:42:21.860
I take testosterone every week.
I take,
uh,
uh,
sh I used to take a cream.

759
00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.740
Now I took a shot.
It seems to last longer.
It seems to work better.

760
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:26.720
But why do I do it?
First of all,

761
00:42:26.721 --> 00:42:30.440
because I'm not competing against anybody and it makes me feel better.
Um,

762
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:31.130
it worked.

763
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:35.450
My body works better when I take it mean that's what testosterone replacement is

764
00:42:35.451 --> 00:42:40.070
all about.
But when it comes to professional athletes doing it,
man,

765
00:42:40.071 --> 00:42:42.650
it's very tricky because on one side,

766
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:47.950
an athlete can take it and it can make them feel better and they can perform

767
00:42:49.101 --> 00:42:53.180
better when their career would be over.
Like you take a guy like a Roger Clemens,

768
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:55.370
and I don't know whether or not Roger Clemens doing anything,

769
00:42:55.371 --> 00:42:58.850
but most people believe he did.
And he's a baseball player.

770
00:42:58.851 --> 00:43:02.180
And then deep into his forties all of a sudden the mother fuckers,

771
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:06.920
he's still throwing 95 mile an hour fast balls and he looks fantastic.

772
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.690
He's built like a brick shit house.
What's going on there?

773
00:43:09.691 --> 00:43:12.170
And we'll most likely he got on hormone replacement.

774
00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:16.700
So the idea being that when you're getting older,

775
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.740
you're getting wiser and you have accumulated all this experience and all this

776
00:43:21.741 --> 00:43:22.490
knowledge,

777
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:26.810
but your body does not perform the way it did when you were younger.

778
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.710
It just doesn't,
the hormones,
they go away.
Your body is preparing for death.

779
00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.210
I mean,
essentially that's what's going on.

780
00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.730
But it isn't bullshit because it's kind of the way the world works.

781
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.960
You know what I mean?
We were only here for a short amount of time,

782
00:43:38.961 --> 00:43:42.380
otherwise fucking Aristotle be sitting right there.
You know,

783
00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:44.560
he'd still be around,
but you know,
I'm on this show.

784
00:43:44.561 --> 00:43:47.540
It would probably be a boring passengers.
I don't understand his language either.

785
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:50.840
Yeah,
no,
I'd love to hear.
I'm just kidding.
But you know,
you know what I'm saying?

786
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.700
It's like everyone has their time and when your time,

787
00:43:52.701 --> 00:43:55.350
this is obviously hypocritical coming from me because I just admitted that I did

788
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.270
take testosterone,
but when you're a fighter,
there's,

789
00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.900
there's the guys that they've gone through all this experience.

790
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:07.280
Their bodies started to fade off and then they get on it and then boom,

791
00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:11.540
all of a sudden their world beaters.
The best example is Vituro.
Yeah,
right.

792
00:44:11.541 --> 00:44:12.440
Vito Belfort,

793
00:44:12.441 --> 00:44:17.240
I maintain that TRT v tour was one of the most spectacular fighters in the

794
00:44:17.241 --> 00:44:20.960
history of fighting his knock out of Rukh lock.
Luke Rockhold,

795
00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:26.000
his knockout of Bisbing.
I mean his knockout of Dan Henderson.
I mean,

796
00:44:26.001 --> 00:44:29.290
he was a fucking destroyer when he was on test.
Yeah.

797
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.360
He would show up with muscles on his fucking eyebrows.
I mean,

798
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:37.980
literally he had muscles on his gums.
His whole body looks like a muscle.

799
00:44:37.981 --> 00:44:42.981
It was insane and he was so aggressive and so confident.

800
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:47.640
It was a completely different vetoer than the Vito that fought like Sakuraba

801
00:44:47.641 --> 00:44:50.990
when he fought in pride,
which was a decade earlier.
Yeah.

802
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:55.500
I mean it's crazy to see something like that happen.
Yeah.
And on one hand,

803
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.500
one hand,
I love it.
And one hand I want to see Vituro fight like that.

804
00:44:58.501 --> 00:45:01.980
I want to see a destroyer.
I'm a guy walks watching entertaining fights.

805
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:06.510
I like watching spectacular performances.
But on another hand I want to see,

806
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:12.080
I want to see someone fighting someone where it's just will and determination

807
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:17.400
and discipline and focus and you,
you,

808
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:22.020
you work towards something and then you achieve it and you do it just by hard

809
00:45:22.021 --> 00:45:26.390
work.
Sure.
I don't want it to be a Goddamn pharmacy competition.
Yeah.

810
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.920
You know,
and that's high level sports.

811
00:45:28.921 --> 00:45:32.730
It is quite that and kind of a moral conversation.
Let's,

812
00:45:32.731 --> 00:45:33.960
let's skew this a little bit.

813
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:38.430
So you look at like stem cell research now,

814
00:45:38.431 --> 00:45:41.130
is that a performance enhancer?
Yeah.

815
00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.700
It's going to be reattaching an ACL from somebody else's ad,

816
00:45:44.701 --> 00:45:47.700
a performance enhancer.
Sure.
It can be right.
I mean,

817
00:45:47.701 --> 00:45:52.701
well it certainly can fix a bad body and that will enhance the performance of

818
00:45:52.711 --> 00:45:55.470
that person can be.
It's an interesting,

819
00:45:55.471 --> 00:45:58.920
and I've heard [inaudible] say this before and I'm not defending,

820
00:45:58.921 --> 00:46:02.720
I'm just say that.
Yeah.
Yes.
I don't know if he's performance enhancing that.

821
00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:06.540
I think he was making a reference to Weidman who had gone over to Germany I

822
00:46:06.541 --> 00:46:10.260
believe,
and had some sort of Regena keen.
I don't know.

823
00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.770
Well I've had that he's wrong and it comes to that doesn't enhance your

824
00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:16.650
performance.
It just makes your inflammation go down.
Okay.

825
00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:19.170
I mean Weidman has mangled knees.

826
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.680
I mean he's had arthritis in his knees so bad that he can't even get his foot to

827
00:46:22.681 --> 00:46:24.600
touches.
But like lift his head.

828
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:28.410
He looked like this like I'm doing sitting right here.
He can't,
he can't do that.

829
00:46:28.411 --> 00:46:29.940
He couldn't get his heel to touch his ass.

830
00:46:29.941 --> 00:46:34.230
His knees are so arthritic and yet he's still beat Anderson Silva twice like

831
00:46:34.231 --> 00:46:38.970
that with those knees.
Cause he's a fucking monster.
He's a monster.

832
00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.610
He's not even 30 oh yeah,
he's a monster.

833
00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:45.780
But what he did was not,
it's not going to make him like me.

834
00:46:45.781 --> 00:46:49.890
It'll make his knees work better,
but that just,
there'd be like normal knees.

835
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.790
It's not like he's going to get to a point where he has like,
you know,

836
00:46:53.791 --> 00:46:57.300
like when you saw Vic tours muscles,
that shit wasn't normal.

837
00:46:57.301 --> 00:47:02.280
So that was above average.
Yeah.
Like an average 16 year old kid who works out,

838
00:47:02.281 --> 00:47:02.700
you know,

839
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:06.120
once or twice a week has better knees than the middle weight champion of the

840
00:47:06.121 --> 00:47:09.810
world.
That's the point is it's the actual pliability of his joints itself.

841
00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.140
I mean,
does that increase some mechanical advantage when the knees work better?

842
00:47:13.141 --> 00:47:16.800
Yeah,
but it only makes it like a normal person.
It's not like,

843
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:20.750
you know what you can get if you're tested up to the gills.

844
00:47:20.751 --> 00:47:23.880
So I don't see how you can make that comparison.
Yeah.
Aesthetically.

845
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:24.900
And where is the,

846
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:29.320
where's the line on medical intervention to performance enhancement or

847
00:47:29.321 --> 00:47:34.180
supplementation?
Supplementation is a good one because that's,
yeah,
creatine.
Well,

848
00:47:34.181 --> 00:47:37.580
I remember beach and that simple.
Bj was shitting on.
Um,

849
00:47:37.581 --> 00:47:40.510
and I'm a huge Bj Penn Fan will be to the day I die.

850
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.890
But BJ was shitting all over GSP,
you know,
hey,
you're taking a test.
You know,

851
00:47:44.891 --> 00:47:47.380
he'd taken Gh,
tell the truth what's going on.

852
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:50.800
And then while you watch BJ working out and he had a fucking,

853
00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:54.670
he had a counter filled with these different supplements.

854
00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:58.060
There's a bunch of shit that they would give him after every,
uh,
every meal.

855
00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:00.220
It was all legal.
It was all like,
you know,

856
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:03.850
glutamine and things along those lines and,
you know,

857
00:48:03.851 --> 00:48:06.670
fish oil and all these different,
various supplements.

858
00:48:06.671 --> 00:48:10.240
But those various supplements,
it's,
that's not food,

859
00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:14.770
that's food that has been broken down and they've isolated very specific

860
00:48:14.771 --> 00:48:16.900
components that they've shown to enhance performance.

861
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:21.400
So you're taking performance enhancing supplements when your taking anything.

862
00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.151
I mean,
any,

863
00:48:22.151 --> 00:48:26.380
the reason why you take multimineral and multivitamins is you want to enhance

864
00:48:26.381 --> 00:48:29.470
the performance of your body,
period.
I mean,
that,
that is what's going on.

865
00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:32.110
It's just going on it,
uh,
uh,
uh,

866
00:48:32.111 --> 00:48:37.060
an edge level as opposed to a jump.
Like when you're tested up,

867
00:48:37.061 --> 00:48:40.810
like [inaudible] tested,
they caught him before.

868
00:48:40.811 --> 00:48:45.280
This is what made them cancel.
Um,
testosterone replacement in Nevada.

869
00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:50.140
I mean they had already had issues with it but they started testing guys off you

870
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:53.710
like just randomly like come here like pee in that cup would hook.

871
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:57.640
That's how they got Overeem.
Vito tested an average person.

872
00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:02.200
It's like an average males because of 300 to 800 is like a high level.

873
00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:07.090
V was 1,475 man,
that's insane.
It doesn't exist in nature.

874
00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:08.740
It just doesn't exist in nature.

875
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.740
And that was one of the reasons why they were like,
ah,
okay.

876
00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:14.530
And this is not idle speculation coming from me.
By the way,

877
00:49:14.531 --> 00:49:17.770
this is me talking to people that are in the know people that were actually

878
00:49:17.771 --> 00:49:20.380
there.
The whole conversation that went down,

879
00:49:20.381 --> 00:49:24.080
I was privy to a lodge and it was very tricky because they,

880
00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:26.320
you have to find out what,
what's ethical.

881
00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:29.440
I mean they loud it in the first place because doctors were saying,

882
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.480
my client has low testosterone and he has an issue Gonad ism or whatever.

883
00:49:34.481 --> 00:49:39.370
Hypergonadism whatever the issue is.
My client has low testosterone.
Um,

884
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:43.000
I as a doctor believe that he has a medical issue that needs to be addressed.

885
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.620
We're going to supplement his testosterone.

886
00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:47.110
So the athletic commissions allowed this,

887
00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:51.010
but they didn't totally understand what they were allowing because they didn't

888
00:49:51.011 --> 00:49:53.290
know that you could take testosterone.

889
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:56.170
And if you took testosterone and then got off testosterone,

890
00:49:56.430 --> 00:50:00.490
you're let natural levels crash.
So then you show up at the doctor and you say,

891
00:50:00.491 --> 00:50:01.211
hey man,
test me.

892
00:50:01.211 --> 00:50:04.420
I feel pretty weak and that the doctor says you have low testosterone,

893
00:50:04.421 --> 00:50:06.160
I'm going to write you a prescription for testosterone.

894
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:08.790
Then you bring that to the athletic commission.
My doctors,
uh,

895
00:50:08.791 --> 00:50:12.790
allowed me to take testosterone.
Here's my blood work.
And they go,
all right,

896
00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:16.390
it seems pretty good.
Go ahead and take it.
I mean,
that what was going on?

897
00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.980
That's what happened with Nate Marquardt.

898
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:22.180
That's what happened with a lot of people.
Um,
that was the issue with,
uh,

899
00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:25.940
when Nate Marquardt was pulled out of his fight with Rick Story.

900
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.630
The very last minute is because the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission tested him

901
00:50:29.631 --> 00:50:32.360
and he was jacked through the roof and they were like,

902
00:50:32.361 --> 00:50:36.230
what you do you are you doing is dangerous.
What was his number?
Do you remember?

903
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:38.940
I don't remember so I won't say it but it was [inaudible].

904
00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:41.120
It was astronomical and it was very high.

905
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:45.380
It was not a number that exists in nature and that's the issue is that these

906
00:50:45.381 --> 00:50:47.180
guys were same as mark Hon.

907
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:51.200
It was not a number that exists in nature that these guys were taking hyper

908
00:50:51.201 --> 00:50:56.201
levels of testosterone when they give you testosterone unless you are going to

909
00:50:56.691 --> 00:51:00.410
the doctor and that doctor is the only one who administers testosterone and they

910
00:51:00.411 --> 00:51:04.910
do it right in front of you.
You can,
you could put in as much in as you want.

911
00:51:04.911 --> 00:51:05.870
Sure.
You know,
if,

912
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:09.710
if Mike Dolce gets a prescription for testosterone and you go to your doctor,

913
00:51:09.711 --> 00:51:13.100
your doctor's going to give you a fucking month supply and you could say,

914
00:51:13.101 --> 00:51:17.270
I don't want to put the whole month and right now see what so look out and then

915
00:51:17.271 --> 00:51:19.070
he just fucking running through walls.

916
00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:23.130
Like the thing from the fantastic four is it's,

917
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.120
it's very weird.
You know,
it's,
it's very,

918
00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.420
I mean like if you're on anything else,

919
00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.630
if you are on any other kind of medication,
they'll give you,
you know,

920
00:51:32.631 --> 00:51:36.080
you take two pills in the morning,
you take two pills at night and here's,

921
00:51:36.081 --> 00:51:37.840
here's your pills,
take those pills.
Yup.

922
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:41.570
But you could just decide to throw the whole bottle down your throat if you're

923
00:51:41.571 --> 00:51:42.470
fucking nuts.

924
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:47.150
Like the only way you could prevent that with testosterone is by restricting

925
00:51:47.151 --> 00:51:51.560
access and making that access only through that medical provider that does it.

926
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:55.010
You know?
Right.
There were no,
everyone knows.

927
00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:58.460
And so they decided to just stop the testosterone replacement.

928
00:51:58.461 --> 00:52:01.790
There was no way they could regulate it.
There's too many ethical concerns.

929
00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:02.950
There's too many concerns with,

930
00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:08.620
but the thing is they started it and they let these people get on it and then

931
00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:11.420
they got him off of it.
And when you get people off of it,

932
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:16.010
their whole endocrine system just crashes and there was no transition period.

933
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:18.860
None.
Yeah.
You need a long transition period.

934
00:52:18.861 --> 00:52:23.861
Like this v Tour Weidman fight is going to be spectacularly interesting from

935
00:52:24.291 --> 00:52:29.291
that perspective because vittores previous performances have been some of the

936
00:52:29.871 --> 00:52:33.440
best performances I've ever seen in all my years of watching MMA.

937
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:38.240
He just looked fantastic and if there was no concern whatsoever,

938
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:42.080
if uh,
there was no issue with testosterone,
he wasn't on anything.

939
00:52:42.081 --> 00:52:45.150
He was just fucking training like a wild man and putting in,
you know,

940
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:47.210
if he was younger and this was all going on,

941
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:52.390
if he didn't have like a noticeable dip and rise and change of his body anatomy,

942
00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:55.490
he would be like one of the most heralded contenders ever.

943
00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:59.420
But everybody looks at him sideways.
Even to this day.

944
00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:03.350
Like Weidman is a huge favorite coming into this fight.
I mean,

945
00:53:03.351 --> 00:53:04.520
I don't know what the numbers are,

946
00:53:04.521 --> 00:53:08.600
but I remember the last time I looked at it was it was a pretty heavy favorite.

947
00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:12.680
Maybe you can look it up,
Jamie.
Find out what Chris Weidman over Vito Belfort is.

948
00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:16.340
If you look at how v toward destroyed Dan Henderson,

949
00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:21.200
you could have destroyed Luke Rockhold.
You look at how he destroyed Bisbing.

950
00:53:21.201 --> 00:53:26.040
Who would say,
how could anybody be a favorite over this guy?
And the

951
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.110
<v 3>reason is is because the testosterone,</v>

952
00:53:28.111 --> 00:53:31.660
sure it's 100% no one wants to bring it up.
I mean the UFC,

953
00:53:31.661 --> 00:53:33.990
he's probably upset that I'm talking about it right now.
You know,

954
00:53:33.991 --> 00:53:36.360
cause they don't like bringing it up.
Like when I do those countdown shows,

955
00:53:36.361 --> 00:53:40.260
we don't talk about testosterone.
I would like to,
I would like to talk about it.

956
00:53:40.261 --> 00:53:42.060
I would like to bring in experts.
I would like to,

957
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:45.750
I would like to talk to a guy like you.
I'd like to talk to an endocrinologist.

958
00:53:45.751 --> 00:53:49.710
I'd like to say what up,
what up?
What is the recovery process?
Cow.

959
00:53:49.711 --> 00:53:54.240
Can a man bring his natural levels back up to where v tour was,

960
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.780
you know,
is it possible that's going to be difficult,

961
00:53:57.781 --> 00:54:01.450
not knowing what his blood work or how bad off he was.
You know,

962
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:03.180
going into the TRT program,

963
00:54:03.181 --> 00:54:07.320
he's going to come out worse off when he said he was at 180 that was what he

964
00:54:07.321 --> 00:54:10.710
said,
which is really low and I would believe that no one,

965
00:54:10.711 --> 00:54:11.880
a lot of the Brazilians,

966
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:15.900
a lot of those kids get on in their early teens because it's a social medicine

967
00:54:15.901 --> 00:54:18.330
over there.
You walk into a gym and that's what the coach hands them,

968
00:54:18.331 --> 00:54:23.331
and I heard this story from dozens of of Brazilians and it's nothing against the

969
00:54:23.611 --> 00:54:26.430
culture.
It's just something that's normal.
Well,
it's legal,
it's legal.

970
00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.680
It's like walking into a GNC and get some protein powder.

971
00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:32.670
It's not like it is over here.
What's over here?
You've got a bit,
get your,

972
00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:33.211
you know,

973
00:54:33.211 --> 00:54:36.150
if you're going to go to a gym and become a bodybuilder and you want to get

974
00:54:36.151 --> 00:54:38.130
testosterone or steroids,

975
00:54:38.131 --> 00:54:42.030
you're going to have to do dealings with some shady people.
Brazil,

976
00:54:42.031 --> 00:54:45.240
you go to the pharmacy,
you go in and you get it done properly.

977
00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:48.390
But unfortunately you open up four to one.
That's almost five to one,

978
00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.690
five to one that's big over veto.

979
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:53.820
The veto that destroyed Dan Henderson the first round,
the veto,

980
00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:57.600
that wheel kick Luke Rockhold into oblivion and someone's a five to one favorite

981
00:54:57.601 --> 00:55:01.200
over him.
That's incredible.
And that's because of that.
It's amazing.

982
00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:06.570
Everyone Remembers Vito when he fought Randy when he was 240 pounds and it looks

983
00:55:06.571 --> 00:55:07.920
like a lion.
Absolutely.

984
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.980
And those are the days I think that if caught up with him and yeah,

985
00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:15.090
cause the issue,
well that was back when he was training with,
uh,
his,

986
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:20.020
his friend Curtis,
who was as a bodybuilder friend who's dead now,
guy died from,

987
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:22.170
from steroids.
That's right.
I remember that.

988
00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:25.470
We used to call them garden hoses because,
uh,
we would,
uh,

989
00:55:25.471 --> 00:55:29.250
work out with this guy who'd be at the gym and he had garden hoses for veins.

990
00:55:29.251 --> 00:55:29.431
I mean,

991
00:55:29.431 --> 00:55:33.300
he would stand there like this and they were just garden hoses all over his
body.

992
00:55:33.301 --> 00:55:37.740
He was so big,
he was so big.
You couldn't believe that he was a human being.

993
00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:42.000
It's a guy's like that from the nineties error bodybuilding days.

994
00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:44.520
They're all fucking dying now.
Yeah,
I've been seeing that.

995
00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:49.440
Mike Matarazzo just died.
Yeah,
crazy Nasser,
that big circle,

996
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.510
somebody,
he's dead.
He died.

997
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:56.510
Those guys were just just red lining the body and red lining.

998
00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.250
The capabilities when the sports,

999
00:55:58.251 --> 00:56:01.650
so we think of bodybuilding like the golden era is like the Arnold

1000
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:02.401
Schwarzenegger,
the Franco Columbia,

1001
00:56:02.401 --> 00:56:05.490
the pumping iron days and the body's didn't change that much.

1002
00:56:05.491 --> 00:56:08.940
Seventies to eighties they were kind of similar and then the early nineties

1003
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.080
that's when Dorian Yates came and just exploded on the scene.

1004
00:56:13.081 --> 00:56:17.610
Then Ronnie Coleman followed up in these 260 pound mass monsters.

1005
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:22.230
Five six,
five,
six fucking insanely crazy rip,

1006
00:56:22.231 --> 00:56:24.070
3% body fat garden

1007
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:28.180
<v 2>hoses running everywhere and it's wasn't as much from what I understand.</v>

1008
00:56:28.181 --> 00:56:30.940
I've been working on a mass building strength building book now,

1009
00:56:30.941 --> 00:56:35.110
so I've been researching more of the bodybuilding side and I'm coming across all

1010
00:56:35.111 --> 00:56:37.150
this information where they're talking now about it.

1011
00:56:37.151 --> 00:56:40.630
It was like insulin and IGF one and growth hormone.

1012
00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:44.950
When those things came into play in those early nineties that's when the body's

1013
00:56:44.951 --> 00:56:48.310
changed.
But now you see what's happening.
1520 years later,

1014
00:56:48.311 --> 00:56:53.050
these guys in their forties and fifties are dropping dead of terrible,

1015
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.110
terrible conditions almost directly with that,

1016
00:56:56.111 --> 00:56:59.890
where you see guys like Arnold and Franco,
you know,
still walking around,

1017
00:56:59.891 --> 00:57:03.470
knocking on the door of seventies Arnold's back on the spike.
She knows muscles.

1018
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:07.580
He's pretty fucking big.
That Hollywood money,
man.
Come on man.
Right.

1019
00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:11.590
Media took care of everything I have to get.
There you go.

1020
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.670
Yeah,
he,
but he is,
but you know,

1021
00:57:15.671 --> 00:57:20.350
Dorian in all fairness is fine too right now.
Yeah,
right now.

1022
00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:23.470
You know,
and that's the thing.
And He seems like a smarter guy.

1023
00:57:23.471 --> 00:57:25.480
Just knowing a little bit.
Actually when we were in Birmingham,

1024
00:57:25.481 --> 00:57:29.220
I swung by temple gym and get a chance to meet him.
What his historic,
you know,

1025
00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:32.800
to meet that guy.
Fucking crazy.
But we'll see.
And hopefully,
you know,

1026
00:57:32.801 --> 00:57:35.710
you don't want to see anything bad happen,
anybody,
but it's,
you know,

1027
00:57:35.711 --> 00:57:38.750
those guys are like on death watch to a degree.
What,
um,

1028
00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:43.480
what fails when they do that?
What fails in their body.

1029
00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.630
All these guys,
it seems to be heart related.

1030
00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:50.200
Their hearts are just exploding on them.
They're enlarged for starters,

1031
00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:52.240
and then they're just some sort of shut down,

1032
00:57:52.241 --> 00:57:55.990
break down and they're just exploding for lack of a more technical term.

1033
00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:58.090
But it's almost all cardiac related.

1034
00:57:58.091 --> 00:58:00.700
Like that's what Matarazzo he was waiting for a heart transplant.
Oh,

1035
00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:05.350
it wasn't even 50 years old yet.
Wow.
You know,
and he's,
he's a Boston Guy,
right?

1036
00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:09.320
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I remember when I was just a kid at that time and that's,

1037
00:58:09.321 --> 00:58:12.130
I was a fallen when I was watching these guys,
like,
you know,

1038
00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:15.700
that's what I want it to be.
And I was like,
well maybe a couple of them.

1039
00:58:15.701 --> 00:58:18.700
So now you've take steroids.
But like now he's,

1040
00:58:18.701 --> 00:58:21.570
these use a muscle tech and he's using the eas creatine and that's you.

1041
00:58:21.571 --> 00:58:22.420
I believe that both,

1042
00:58:22.421 --> 00:58:27.010
not never flex wheeler and flex had fucking kidney transplant.
He did it.
Yes.

1043
00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:28.510
I'm don't quote me on the kidney transplant,

1044
00:58:28.511 --> 00:58:31.990
but he had kidney failure and that's what took him out of bodybuilding at his

1045
00:58:31.991 --> 00:58:35.800
absolute prime.
I'm 90% sure was it is a transplant,
isn't that the kidney thing?

1046
00:58:35.801 --> 00:58:39.460
Due to cutting weight,
they would dehydrate the shit out of themselves.

1047
00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:43.930
Massive prescription diuretics.
So it's cutting weight is one thing.

1048
00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:49.110
Using a very powerful pharmaceutical diuretic that's like water and fucking,

1049
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:55.230
you know,
I'm rubbing alcohol as far as you know,

1050
00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:58.960
putting that into your body.
And that's what like Mohammed,

1051
00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:02.110
Ben Aziza and I think Andrea is months or some of these famous older

1052
00:59:02.111 --> 00:59:06.160
bodybuilders were just huge into those prescription diuretics and they just

1053
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:09.430
fucking blow their body up from the inside out,
look amazing on the outside.

1054
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:12.610
And then guys like Paul the let you know,
I'm kind of really,
you know,

1055
00:59:12.611 --> 00:59:15.360
going back 20 years in my remembrance is a bodybuilding.

1056
00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:19.930
I remember these guys collapsing and just thinking like,
oh,
you know,
they didn't,

1057
00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.980
they look like such specimens.
Why are

1058
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.850
<v 4>they so unhealthy?
And that's really,
I think what turned me into what I am today.</v>

1059
00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:29.720
I saw that,
you know,
and,
and take my story back even farther and I touched on it,

1060
00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:33.230
you know,
years ago where I saw my father collapse massive stroke.

1061
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:36.950
I was eight year old kid and he was like really in shape.

1062
00:59:36.951 --> 00:59:40.070
He was a thoroughbred horse trainer and he just fucking had a massive stroke.

1063
00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:43.730
I was like,
how the fuck like spun,
how is this even possible?

1064
00:59:43.731 --> 00:59:46.160
And then all the doctor's visits and all this shit for years.

1065
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:48.530
Well he was burning his candle at both ends.

1066
00:59:48.531 --> 00:59:51.200
Fucking drinking coffee in the morning,
not even until late at night,

1067
00:59:51.201 --> 00:59:55.400
working like 16,
20 hour days.
Really,
you know,
hard,
hard work and days,
you know,

1068
00:59:55.401 --> 00:59:57.050
sitting back,
kicking some beers and whatnot.

1069
00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:01.010
Burnt his body out from the inside family history of heart disease,
hypertension,

1070
01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.010
didn't take care of himself.
Boom.
Fast forward,
I see this,

1071
01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:08.150
this bodybuilding shit and it really fascinated nails fascinate as a,

1072
01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:09.950
as a boy all the way up through fascinated.

1073
01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:13.670
And as I continued and I was 280 pound power lifter at some point brought my

1074
01:00:13.671 --> 01:00:17.540
body,
we'd all the way up my mid twenties,
280 pounds.
And,
uh,

1075
01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:22.280
one day I go to the doctor for a basic health tests,
wellness test,

1076
01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:27.140
high cholesterol,
high blood pressure,
hypertension,
sleep apnea,

1077
01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:31.250
get hooked up to a holter monitor and heart palpitations doctors like,

1078
01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.840
what are you doing?
I'm like,
I don't fucking know.
I'm trying to be big on,

1079
01:00:34.841 --> 01:00:37.400
you know,
I tried to be Arnold Schwarzenegger over here.
And she's like,
yeah,

1080
01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:40.880
this got to change.
And that's when I,
my mind spun.
I just saw it for what it is.

1081
01:00:40.881 --> 01:00:44.120
I've pictured my father was like,
I got to fucking change this immediate.

1082
01:00:44.121 --> 01:00:45.800
And that's when I was performance science-based,

1083
01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:49.280
lots of supplements and lots of micronutrients and you know,

1084
01:00:49.281 --> 01:00:51.470
protein ratio and all that,
that bullshit,

1085
01:00:51.471 --> 01:00:53.900
that bodybuilding bullshit and then spun it.

1086
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:57.740
And that's when I became this fucking organic like pseudo hippie health

1087
01:00:57.741 --> 01:01:01.640
longevity dude.
And when I focused on that and he lost 110 pounds,
you know,

1088
01:01:01.641 --> 01:01:05.630
through my own personal experience and what I was always working with athletes.

1089
01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:06.560
You know,
he like when I was,

1090
01:01:06.561 --> 01:01:08.540
since I was 17 years old for so my training business,

1091
01:01:08.541 --> 01:01:12.350
I was always working with athletes and I took that performance side and I went

1092
01:01:12.351 --> 01:01:13.400
to the longevity side.

1093
01:01:13.401 --> 01:01:18.401
And what I saw is once we all started focusing on longevity protocols as opposed

1094
01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:21.320
to performance protocols,
everybody's performance went through the roof,

1095
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:25.100
their lean mass.
So when you say longevity protocols,
yeah.
What do you,

1096
01:01:25.101 --> 01:01:26.960
what do you mean specifically?
I mean,
I mean real food,

1097
01:01:26.961 --> 01:01:29.620
getting rid of all the supplements,
getting rid of all the pseudoscience,

1098
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:33.110
getting back to what's most natural,
you know,

1099
01:01:33.111 --> 01:01:35.930
and I use the term earth grow nutrients because I used to say whole foods and

1100
01:01:35.931 --> 01:01:37.850
people thought that meant go shopping at the supermarket,

1101
01:01:37.851 --> 01:01:42.200
no eating food from the planet.
That was like really the first step for me.

1102
01:01:42.201 --> 01:01:45.680
And I don't care as much about micro nutrient ratios and Wayne,

1103
01:01:45.681 --> 01:01:48.560
cause I used to weigh my food and I used to sit there and I would spend a half

1104
01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.290
hour every night and program all my meals and come up with all these different,

1105
01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:54.260
you know,
training cycles and I was,
you know,
that do that.

1106
01:01:54.261 --> 01:01:57.650
It's insane dude about making these performance enhancements fast,

1107
01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.310
this fucking ridiculous sneak to focus on eating real food,

1108
01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:04.550
extremely nutrient dense foods from the planet's fresh as possible,

1109
01:02:04.551 --> 01:02:05.690
as live as possible.

1110
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:09.200
And all the science that's out there shows that that's the healthier way.

1111
01:02:09.201 --> 01:02:12.170
And all these different cultures that eat like that tend to be much healthier,

1112
01:02:12.171 --> 01:02:16.550
perform at a higher level for a much longer period of time,
longer age,
you know,

1113
01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:21.570
a longer lifespan and a high utility.
And that's really the difference.

1114
01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.000
Not only do they live longer,

1115
01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:26.010
they have a very high utility while they're living longer,

1116
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:31.170
50608090100 plus years old where they're still able to go out,

1117
01:02:31.171 --> 01:02:34.830
fish,
swim,
do all these different things.
That's what really turned my mind.

1118
01:02:34.831 --> 01:02:39.300
And this is back shit 15,
probably 15 years ago now.
Um,

1119
01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:42.600
and then I started implementing that with my athletes,

1120
01:02:42.601 --> 01:02:44.520
whether it's the power lifters,
the wrestlers of the grapplers,

1121
01:02:44.521 --> 01:02:48.140
and then your early two thousands and years was the NHB athletes before MMA.

1122
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:50.680
That's like kind of how I got the start into,
uh,
you know,

1123
01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.370
the MMA world was through team Henzel,
Gracie on the east coast,

1124
01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:56.730
guys like Kurt Pellegrino and Dante Rivera when they're fighting for that ring

1125
01:02:56.731 --> 01:03:00.540
of combat,
you know,
Nhb,
you know,
titles and whatnot focused on,
you know,

1126
01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:04.530
those guys.
And it was all real foods and it was like everyone was like,

1127
01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.750
what do you mean I don't have to take my CytoSport,

1128
01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:10.470
my protein powder and pop all these fucking pills?
I was like,
no,
you know,

1129
01:03:10.471 --> 01:03:13.560
it was like almost like a leap of faith that for a while for a lot of athletes

1130
01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.330
to buy into.
Like,

1131
01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:20.660
you mean I have to eat salads and fruit and make a smoothie and just like,

1132
01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.240
you know,
now that we talk about in the culture is a little more advanced.

1133
01:03:24.241 --> 01:03:26.850
I think the science is out there and it's,
it's been proven for,
you know,

1134
01:03:26.851 --> 01:03:30.780
a decade plus that people realize,
well that's the better way to go now.

1135
01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:31.770
But going back,
you know,

1136
01:03:31.771 --> 01:03:35.550
10 15 years ago that was like everybody was living at a fucking jugs,
you know,

1137
01:03:35.551 --> 01:03:37.140
protein patters and GNCs and all that shit.

1138
01:03:37.141 --> 01:03:40.440
That was the big rage in the late nineties all the way into the early two

1139
01:03:40.441 --> 01:03:42.540
thousands and such.
So spun that,

1140
01:03:42.541 --> 01:03:46.560
switched it focused on the real foods and that's what we've been doing with the

1141
01:03:46.561 --> 01:03:50.400
athlete sense.
So going back to the longevity,
when I work with an athlete like a,

1142
01:03:50.401 --> 01:03:53.100
a Tiago,
that's her Rhonda Rousey or,
or whoever else,

1143
01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:55.380
my goal is not for them to win a world title.

1144
01:03:55.381 --> 01:03:57.040
My goal is not about their way into my goals,

1145
01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.570
not about really anything sport related within the next five years.

1146
01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.620
My goal is for them to be 120 years old,
healthy,
fresh,
vibrant,

1147
01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.450
showing their great,
great grandkids,

1148
01:04:06.451 --> 01:04:10.320
photos of back when they won the UFC world title and all these great times that

1149
01:04:10.321 --> 01:04:13.950
they have 120 years old.
Is that really pop?
Has that ever been done?

1150
01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:18.480
It's possible now if we focus on it now because we're talking,

1151
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:22.380
that's 80 years from now and with the medical advancements that are happening

1152
01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:25.020
with the way science is continuing to evolve,

1153
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.050
it's possible if we don't fuck it up early,

1154
01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:31.890
and this is where I talk to the athletes about the weight cutting Stuart's 52

1155
01:04:31.891 --> 01:04:34.590
weeks beforehand.
If we don't fuck everything up now,

1156
01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:38.280
science is going to advance to the point to keep us healthier,

1157
01:04:38.281 --> 01:04:41.940
longer offset some of these issues at a later stage of life.

1158
01:04:41.941 --> 01:04:45.960
Instead of having a like Matarazzo Nina fucking heart transplant when you're 40

1159
01:04:45.961 --> 01:04:46.441
instead of,

1160
01:04:46.441 --> 01:04:50.850
well maybe when you're 80 it's slowly starts to give out because you've eaten

1161
01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.970
fucking great,
highly nutrient dense foods your entire life.

1162
01:04:53.971 --> 01:04:57.150
You've been resting your body completely,
not burning your nervous system out.

1163
01:04:57.390 --> 01:05:01.260
You're training intelligently enough to stimulate progress but not enough to

1164
01:05:01.261 --> 01:05:04.350
shut anything down and break anything.
Now you're living a rewarding,

1165
01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:07.770
happy life surrounding yourself with positive people and that's something that

1166
01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:12.771
you talk about here all the time and that's almost the most important aspect is

1167
01:05:12.811 --> 01:05:15.840
being a very well adjusted,
happy,
positive individual.

1168
01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.610
And this is something that when I work with athletes,

1169
01:05:18.611 --> 01:05:21.130
a lot of people think that it's just this,
this fucking diet dude,

1170
01:05:21.131 --> 01:05:23.080
or I'm just making eggs for her hand in my athletes water.

1171
01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:25.090
I think that's the least of what I do.

1172
01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:28.270
The most of what I did was I try and get inside the athlete's head,

1173
01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:32.980
hadn't helped them focus on,
excuse me,
focus on their life and what they,

1174
01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:34.270
what they want out of their life,

1175
01:05:34.271 --> 01:05:37.960
setting up goals and helping them develop action steps in eliminating this

1176
01:05:37.961 --> 01:05:41.380
negative energy around them so they can truly realize their full potential.

1177
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:45.340
And that's,
you know,
I call it,
we put a bubble of positivity around the athlete,

1178
01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:48.430
especially as we get closer to the competition because that's when it's most

1179
01:05:48.431 --> 01:05:52.060
important.
But it's really,
we try and keep that around them their entire life.

1180
01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:56.500
Give them the tools,
teach them the lessons now that they can carry on.
So we'll,

1181
01:05:56.501 --> 01:05:58.000
we all lift 120 I don't know,

1182
01:05:58.001 --> 01:06:02.800
but I've read scientific research that assumes or believes that there's humans

1183
01:06:02.801 --> 01:06:07.270
being born right now on the planet right now that will exceed 200 years old.
Now.

1184
01:06:07.271 --> 01:06:10.770
Will that happen?
Who fucking knows Jamie?
Look at him.
Don't make be.

1185
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:14.170
Actually it could be he's fucked me as fuck.
He's gone.
Can I get more pussy?

1186
01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.493
Oh that.

1187
01:06:17.130 --> 01:06:21.140
<v 1>Oh,
there you go.
Yeah.
Um,
but you,</v>

1188
01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.200
you bring up some really important points about stress and about surrounding

1189
01:06:25.201 --> 01:06:29.580
yourself with positive things and positive energy.
You can tell the difference.

1190
01:06:29.850 --> 01:06:32.850
Like if you have some bad shit in your life,
you have some conflict,

1191
01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.190
you'll feel bad about that conflict you feel.

1192
01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:39.930
And the key is to resolve that stuff as much as possible.
And then,

1193
01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:40.590
you know,

1194
01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:43.590
figuring out a way to make peace with the rest of it and move on with your life.

1195
01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:46.590
And just the less you put out battling it,

1196
01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:49.890
the better you'll feel about it.
Yeah.
Just you know,

1197
01:06:50.370 --> 01:06:53.070
when I was younger I would argue to people that everything was constantly

1198
01:06:53.071 --> 01:06:55.500
involved in conflict.
And then I realized as I got older,

1199
01:06:55.501 --> 01:06:57.570
the less conflict I have,
the better I feel.

1200
01:06:57.571 --> 01:07:00.540
And the more I resolve conflict and not and not and not get in it,

1201
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:02.880
it's better for everybody.
It's better for that person.

1202
01:07:02.881 --> 01:07:05.280
It's better for me this certain shit that's unavoidable.

1203
01:07:05.281 --> 01:07:07.980
But like all these people that are running around suing people all the time,

1204
01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.030
those are the mother fuckers die heart attack.

1205
01:07:10.031 --> 01:07:12.930
So those are the mother fuckers that have stress cause they're constantly

1206
01:07:12.931 --> 01:07:16.300
involved in battle and not the right kind of battle.
Either.

1207
01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.360
Not like a competition,
you know,

1208
01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:23.570
but just trying to lash out and then dealing with people lashing out at you and

1209
01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.650
all your day is spent thinking about it.
And if he says this,

1210
01:07:28.651 --> 01:07:30.450
I'm going to say that.
And then if she says that,

1211
01:07:30.451 --> 01:07:31.890
I'm going to tell her what the fuck is up.

1212
01:07:31.891 --> 01:07:36.840
And that kind of shit wears on you man.
You're grinding your gears all day,

1213
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:38.790
eats you alive and people don't think of it.

1214
01:07:38.791 --> 01:07:43.020
Do you think you don't think of that as being a stress like they think of stress

1215
01:07:43.021 --> 01:07:47.280
as being bills.
They think of stress as being traffic,
no stresses.
Every,

1216
01:07:47.310 --> 01:07:51.750
all those things are stress,
relationships,
friendships,
work conflict.

1217
01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:55.260
When you're at work all day and you hate your job,
that stress,

1218
01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:57.540
that is stress that grinds on you.

1219
01:07:57.810 --> 01:08:00.810
That feeling like when you get out of work at the end of the day and you have

1220
01:08:00.811 --> 01:08:05.010
that weight lifted off your shoulders,
that means you're in a bad job.

1221
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:09.090
You got to figure out a way where you don't have that.
If it's possible,

1222
01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.920
if it's possible,
find that way.

1223
01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:16.310
That was me 10 years ago was a municipal tax assessor,

1224
01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:18.680
<v 2>the state of New Jersey.
Oh,
amazing.</v>

1225
01:08:18.681 --> 01:08:22.310
It was the just saying all those things together make me want to fucking jump

1226
01:08:22.311 --> 01:08:24.140
off a roof on Friday.

1227
01:08:24.141 --> 01:08:28.340
I would literally get depressed on Friday because I knew Monday was coming.
Yeah,

1228
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:30.950
I know that feeling and it was fucking,
it was God damn hell,

1229
01:08:30.951 --> 01:08:33.380
but I was making a shit load of money.
My mom was so proud of me.

1230
01:08:33.381 --> 01:08:37.490
I had the 401k in the six weeks off vacation.
I was living the American dream.

1231
01:08:37.491 --> 01:08:40.520
I fucking hated myself.
I sat around,

1232
01:08:40.521 --> 01:08:41.870
I remember this was the turning point for me.

1233
01:08:41.871 --> 01:08:44.570
I sat around a boardroom table and it was a lot younger than my closest peer.

1234
01:08:44.571 --> 01:08:47.330
And I'm looking at all these older dudes and we're all sitting there in suits

1235
01:08:47.331 --> 01:08:50.030
and like,
we all were so fucking important,
you know,
being those dickheads.

1236
01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:53.810
And they're all overweight.
They're all,

1237
01:08:53.811 --> 01:08:56.180
they all have red faces and they're all talking about how they're going to

1238
01:08:56.181 --> 01:08:56.991
fucking,
you know,

1239
01:08:56.991 --> 01:08:59.900
sneak off to the bar before they go home because they don't want to deal with

1240
01:08:59.901 --> 01:09:02.690
the fucking family and the kids and all the fucking bullshit.

1241
01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:04.670
I get it the fuck out of here.

1242
01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:08.120
I have to get the fuck Outta here where I'm going to fucking die like this.

1243
01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:12.380
I got to change my life.
And that's what we did.
And I kind of threw that away,

1244
01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:13.300
resigned from the position,

1245
01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:16.460
took the job as the strength coach at team quest up in the Portland,
Oregon.

1246
01:09:16.461 --> 01:09:21.410
Moved across the country for fucking minimum wage to clean toilets and left that

1247
01:09:21.411 --> 01:09:25.760
job behind.
And I fucking loved it.
I loved scrubbing disgusting,

1248
01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:29.750
Shitty Gym Mats at five o'clock in the morning and not sitting at a beautiful

1249
01:09:29.751 --> 01:09:34.010
corner office,
you know,
for x amount of dollars per year.
Because I was,

1250
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:37.520
I was doing what I love and I gave myself the opportunity and the chance,

1251
01:09:37.650 --> 01:09:40.250
you know,
to do something with my life and get rid of the stress.

1252
01:09:40.251 --> 01:09:41.870
I think that's why I'm kind of veering off it.

1253
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:44.800
That's what it was talking about was so stressed out and I was riding my bike.

1254
01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:47.540
Fuck.
I remember it was freezing cold,
fucking raining.

1255
01:09:47.690 --> 01:09:50.450
And I'm riding my fucking stupid bike cause we only have one vehicle.
You know,

1256
01:09:50.451 --> 01:09:51.590
my wife had to go fucking work.

1257
01:09:51.591 --> 01:09:54.470
I'm a riding my fucking bike six miles to the gym and I fucking loved it.

1258
01:09:54.471 --> 01:09:58.820
It was such a pure,
crisp,
cold morning and it was just so alive in life.
You know,

1259
01:09:58.821 --> 01:09:59.270
and it was,

1260
01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:02.150
everything was brand new again and I was in my mid twenties at that point,

1261
01:10:02.151 --> 01:10:04.550
mid later twenties at that point.
It's fucking cool shit man.

1262
01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.300
<v 1>Ah,
yeah man.
Taking chances and,
and branching out on your own.</v>

1263
01:10:10.301 --> 01:10:11.950
When it works out and rewards you,

1264
01:10:11.951 --> 01:10:15.340
it lets you know that the universe rewards risk.

1265
01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:19.270
It rewards calculated risk and passion.
It really does.
And if you,

1266
01:10:19.271 --> 01:10:23.710
if you don't live your life like that,
you're living your life.
Afraid of risk.

1267
01:10:23.730 --> 01:10:27.610
You God man,
you're gonna,
you're not gonna get any reward either.

1268
01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:31.510
You just going to be stuck.
You're going to be stuck in this bland,

1269
01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:36.780
boring ass grinding existence and then it's over.

1270
01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.750
Then it's over.
Yeah.
It's not like it lasts forever.
That's the number one thing.

1271
01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:45.040
Everybody wants to stay,
stay safe and comfortable.
Shit,
this doesn't last.

1272
01:10:45.130 --> 01:10:47.860
This is not going to last.
You got to be uncomfortable.

1273
01:10:47.861 --> 01:10:52.180
I'm uncomfortable all the fucking time.
I don't like 90 ship.

1274
01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:55.450
90% of what I do.
I don't like in some ways,
you know,

1275
01:10:55.451 --> 01:11:00.230
whether it's the exercise or writing or even performing the gist,

1276
01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:04.300
but I hate editing my shit.
I just had to edit my comedy special today.

1277
01:11:04.301 --> 01:11:07.330
I fucking hate staring at myself.
I don't like it.
It's uncomfortable.

1278
01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:11.500
You got to do shit that's uncomfortable.
You get over it and then you get,

1279
01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:13.890
but you don't like certain about it.

1280
01:11:13.891 --> 01:11:16.320
You've got to figure out what don't I like about it?
What's not good,
what's,

1281
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:17.280
what can I make better?

1282
01:11:17.281 --> 01:11:20.520
And then you make it better and you keep pushing and working and the more you do

1283
01:11:20.521 --> 01:11:23.540
that,
the,
the more exciting it is.
The more you have.

1284
01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:25.380
You get a little bit of a reward,

1285
01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:28.560
a little bit of juice at accomplishing something and then you're onto the next

1286
01:11:28.561 --> 01:11:33.000
thing.
But your life is constantly fun,
filled with exciting shit.

1287
01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.710
This thing's going on all the time.

1288
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:39.150
You'd got to assess and move on and move forward.
And if you don't do that,

1289
01:11:39.151 --> 01:11:42.810
you're just stagnant.
Your pond water that you can't drink,

1290
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:44.800
you know your fuck festering.

1291
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:47.880
<v 2>Diane,
what drives you?</v>

1292
01:11:47.881 --> 01:11:51.810
Have you ever kind of analyze like what drives you to get your ass out of bed,

1293
01:11:51.811 --> 01:11:55.170
make yourself uncomfortable yet again on another day that you can just fucking

1294
01:11:55.171 --> 01:11:55.800
put your feet up,

1295
01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.560
<v 1>been laid by the pool and enjoy the sunshine.
Mental illness.</v>

1296
01:11:58.590 --> 01:12:02.460
That's what drives me.
There you go.
That's what's wrong with me.
There you go.

1297
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:04.840
But I don't feel like I ever deserve breaks.

1298
01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:09.300
The only time I ever feel like I have to have a fucking brutal day where I can

1299
01:12:09.301 --> 01:12:13.170
enjoy television,
but if my birthday's brutal enough,
all like,
all right bitch,

1300
01:12:13.171 --> 01:12:15.040
she could sit down and watch a little TV and you know,

1301
01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:18.990
that's the only way I'll allow myself those,
those rewards.

1302
01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:23.460
But if I do do that,
I can really enjoy it.
I could really enjoy a nice foot up,

1303
01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:27.870
you know,
relaxing,
sit there,
you know,
have a,
have a cocktail,

1304
01:12:27.871 --> 01:12:31.320
watch some television.
I can enjoy that.
But if I don't,
I can't enjoy it.

1305
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:34.770
I think a lot of people,
they're giving themselves rewards all the time,

1306
01:12:34.771 --> 01:12:37.620
but there's no risk.
And then there's also,
there's no,

1307
01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:40.380
there's no like sacrifice that led up to that reward.

1308
01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:45.000
And you got to enjoy the sacrifice.
You got to enjoy the grind.
You know,

1309
01:12:45.001 --> 01:12:49.230
when I say that,
90% of the Shit I do,
I don't enjoy.
I don't,

1310
01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:52.890
but I enjoy that I can do it.
You know,
like who the fuck wants to lift weights?

1311
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:55.980
No.
You want the reward of the lifting weights,
you know,

1312
01:12:55.981 --> 01:12:59.580
and the only way you get a strong body is if you do shit you don't want to do.

1313
01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:03.150
When you get to that third rep,
you're like,
I'm good,
but you're not good stupid.

1314
01:13:03.151 --> 01:13:05.690
You've got seven more to go.
And if you don't do those seven more,

1315
01:13:05.691 --> 01:13:08.050
you're gonna feel like a fucking loser when you put those weights down.
Yeah.

1316
01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:11.280
You're like,
I'm a bitch.
I should have fucking kept calling.
And I stopped.

1317
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:15.030
You know,
if you stop,
you're missing out on the whole point.

1318
01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:20.400
That is the grind.
That is the keeping going,
the good kind of grind,

1319
01:13:20.401 --> 01:13:22.120
the working towards something,
grind,

1320
01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:24.710
<v 2>last name.
They're like,
dolce,</v>

1321
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:28.820
do you cheat or can I cheat or do you have a cheat day?
And I always retort.

1322
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:35.090
Why are you going to cheat?
Have you earned it and that that's what we use.

1323
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:37.280
Is it earned mills?
I don't fucking cheat meals.
Not a cheat day.

1324
01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:40.280
It's an earned meal.
Have you earned it?
And I'm like,
well,
I don't know.

1325
01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:41.840
Well then you have it like,

1326
01:13:41.841 --> 01:13:45.110
like you when you know if when you fucking kick your own ass,

1327
01:13:45.111 --> 01:13:46.040
you're totally spent.

1328
01:13:46.041 --> 01:13:49.730
That's when you reward yourself with your earned TV time or whatever it is.

1329
01:13:49.731 --> 01:13:50.564
Your cocktail.

1330
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:53.780
Same thing when it comes to health and fitness and this is goes to the

1331
01:13:53.781 --> 01:13:56.120
accountability side.
If you want to be successful,

1332
01:13:56.150 --> 01:13:58.820
you want to set yourself up to succeed.
Well,
you have to be accountable.

1333
01:13:58.821 --> 01:14:01.970
I can't fucking do it.
I can't do it for you.
I wish I could.

1334
01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:03.950
There's 7 billion people on the planet.
I can't do it.

1335
01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:05.720
I can barely do it from my own self,

1336
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:08.450
let alone every other fucking person out there and each one of us,

1337
01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:12.130
we are entirely alone.
100% we're by all this

1338
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:15.190
<v 4>stuff,
which is just a facade.
It's all bullshit.
It's easier to kind of amusing,</v>

1339
01:14:15.191 --> 01:14:18.580
entertaining and often distract us.
But if we're going to be successful,

1340
01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:20.440
it has to be because it comes from the inside.

1341
01:14:20.441 --> 01:14:23.590
That driving force to make us successful so that people that want to cheat on

1342
01:14:23.591 --> 01:14:26.890
Saturday,
Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday,
they go to the gym,
they do their little thing,

1343
01:14:26.891 --> 01:14:28.690
they eat their chicken and rice,
you know,
Monday through Friday,

1344
01:14:28.691 --> 01:14:31.180
maybe they're kind of,
okay,
they cheat just a little bit here and there.

1345
01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:34.410
They'd go off menu,
let's say,
and then Saturday is my cheat day or Sundays,

1346
01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:35.560
my cheat day football's on.

1347
01:14:35.561 --> 01:14:37.570
And what happens Monday look fucking exactly the same.

1348
01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:41.320
And then they do the same basic workout for the same basic wraps and they do

1349
01:14:41.321 --> 01:14:44.110
that,
you know,
the same.
It's just the fucking same in there on that rat wheel.

1350
01:14:44.111 --> 01:14:46.420
So it'd be really,
you know,
talking to the people out there.

1351
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:48.830
You really want to break out.
You really want to be spectacular.

1352
01:14:48.831 --> 01:14:50.560
You really want to start to fulfill your potential.

1353
01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:52.630
You have to make yourself uncomfortable.

1354
01:14:52.631 --> 01:14:57.400
You have to challenge yourself and then you have to earn it.
So with my athletes,

1355
01:14:57.401 --> 01:15:00.040
with myself are earned meals or maybe once or twice a month.

1356
01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:02.980
And what is an earned media?
I don't know.
Maybe it's my wife's birthday,

1357
01:15:02.981 --> 01:15:03.791
maybe you know,

1358
01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:07.090
it was just going to see a fucking movie or something's coming out.

1359
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:11.110
And then what is my earned me on my earned meals typically a little bit more

1360
01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:13.750
food that I normally fucking love anyway because you know,

1361
01:15:13.751 --> 01:15:15.340
our recipes are fucking delicious.

1362
01:15:15.341 --> 01:15:18.940
I'm not going to eat some shit burger outside when I can make a kick ass grass

1363
01:15:18.941 --> 01:15:21.430
fed fucking burger with baked sweet potato fries,
whatever.

1364
01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:25.390
Eat four of those motherfuckers instead of just eating my traditional six or

1365
01:15:25.391 --> 01:15:28.930
eight ounce one.
So that would be a basic earned meal.
No Krispy Kreme donuts.

1366
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:33.670
Oh God,
I would love to.
And they're the former DOJ.
What I would fuck,

1367
01:15:33.671 --> 01:15:36.550
I was the farmer,
don't former dude 282 pounds.

1368
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.910
You know,

1369
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:43.450
once upon a time I was the dude that I get a whole pizza and I put a half a

1370
01:15:43.450 --> 01:15:45.610
pound of provolone cheese on top.
Eat that whole motherfucker,

1371
01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:47.020
half gallon of ice cream,

1372
01:15:47.021 --> 01:15:50.800
big king size snickers bar and something colored to finish it down colored

1373
01:15:50.801 --> 01:15:55.420
beverages only like,
hi,
see what I see fucking crush Hawaiian punch.

1374
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:59.080
And what if it was colored?
It had more calories so it's fucking drinking it.

1375
01:15:59.081 --> 01:16:01.480
Yeah.
Oh hell yeah.
Grape soda root beer in the summer.

1376
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:04.450
And was that a cheat day or was that,
that was,

1377
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:06.310
that was the time performance science.

1378
01:16:06.311 --> 01:16:09.120
That was me trying to hit 10,000 calories a day so I could squat,
you know,

1379
01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:13.210
700 800 plus pounds and dead lift,
you know,
six,
700 pounds.

1380
01:16:13.211 --> 01:16:16.740
That was when I was only goal oriented.
Performance oriented,

1381
01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:21.250
tons of fucking protein powders,
weight gainers,
creatine and CMA and fucking ATM.

1382
01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.710
Those weight gainers,
like you see those tubs.

1383
01:16:23.711 --> 01:16:28.540
It was not just calories and sugar garbage.
It's all fucking garbage man.
Um,

1384
01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.900
unfortunate.
They're all,
it's all preservative.
It's all chemicals.

1385
01:16:31.901 --> 01:16:32.621
It's all coloring.

1386
01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:36.460
It's all additives and it's very little of the nutrition you're actually

1387
01:16:36.461 --> 01:16:37.300
purchasing it for.

1388
01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:40.900
It's such watered down components of what is on the front label.

1389
01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.310
Just enough to leave.

1390
01:16:42.311 --> 01:16:45.320
So they can legally put it in there and not get fucking sued and it's a shit

1391
01:16:45.321 --> 01:16:46.210
load of everything else.

1392
01:16:46.730 --> 01:16:51.730
<v 1>So your journey to becoming this MMA fitness Diet Guru,</v>

I see the guys with these dolce diet shirts on.

1401
01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.930
I mean you have so many athletes that that,

1402
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:25.880
that follow your protocols and whenever someone is in trouble and they have a

1403
01:17:25.881 --> 01:17:29.690
hard time cutting weight,
they come to you.
How did all this start?

1404
01:17:29.691 --> 01:17:31.430
Like how did you become this guy?

1405
01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:34.280
Was it through like what you said Kurt Pellgrino and then someone,

1406
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:36.800
Kurt told other people and that kind of shit.
And that was,

1407
01:17:36.801 --> 01:17:41.090
that was like 2002 2003 I was working with guys on team Henzel Gracie.

1408
01:17:41.091 --> 01:17:41.461
I was young,

1409
01:17:41.461 --> 01:17:44.660
started training with under Hanzo and I had been a power lifter for years before

1410
01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:47.510
that and I was an amateur wrestler for years before that.

1411
01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:49.880
So I've been cutting weight since I was 13 years old.

1412
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:54.590
I was a varsity captain as a freshman,
so four year Varsity Letterman,

1413
01:17:54.591 --> 01:17:58.070
captain of the team and I was just,
since I was eight years old,
father,
you know,

1414
01:17:58.100 --> 01:17:59.270
fucking massive stroke.

1415
01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:04.190
I dove into body building and weightlifting at that age and I was just attuned

1416
01:18:04.191 --> 01:18:06.470
to it.
I was like,
honors science is biology,

1417
01:18:06.471 --> 01:18:10.460
mathematics and I just had that type of analytical brain and I would analyze

1418
01:18:10.461 --> 01:18:13.610
everything and all this shit so you know,
won't get too deep into that.

1419
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:17.570
As I went through,
I was always cutting weight,
always trying to get bigger.

1420
01:18:17.571 --> 01:18:21.350
I was trying to get stronger.
I was rather short,
had no money,
family was broke,

1421
01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:22.580
want it to go to college,

1422
01:18:22.581 --> 01:18:24.920
how the fuck am I going to get poor kid from fucking New Jersey?

1423
01:18:24.921 --> 01:18:25.850
How am I going to go to college?

1424
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:29.180
Only way I could do it was through a scholarship.
There's no cash.

1425
01:18:29.181 --> 01:18:32.240
Mom's working three jobs and there's no heat on in the fucking house so there's

1426
01:18:32.241 --> 01:18:36.710
no extra money for,
you know,
for this kid number three to go to fucking school.

1427
01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:38.780
So,
and that became my focus.

1428
01:18:38.781 --> 01:18:41.810
I had to focus on that and I had a shit wrestling team,
you know,

1429
01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:45.250
love the guys and we'd made me who I am.
But we were appropriate school.

1430
01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.740
I started on the team,
it was the second year the team was even in existence.

1431
01:18:48.741 --> 01:18:52.670
Our coaches were great dudes,
but they didn't have the high level experience.

1432
01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:53.690
None of my teammates did.

1433
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:56.540
How am I going to advance the only one that's not through technique?

1434
01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:59.600
It's not through experience and that's through grinding,
you know,
steel on steel.

1435
01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.340
It's just being in better shape than everybody.

1436
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:05.120
I had to be that guy and that's the guy that I actually became and that's what

1437
01:19:05.121 --> 01:19:08.630
really started more of this focus on the strength and conditioning.

1438
01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:12.470
Do you work with guys on strength and conditioning as well as working with them?

1439
01:19:12.471 --> 01:19:14.660
With Diet.
Like how do you balance that out?

1440
01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:18.770
Because I talked to Steve Maxwell about this and Maxwell who was uh,
you know,

1441
01:19:18.771 --> 01:19:22.490
really,
really well respected guy and a very,

1442
01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:26.300
very knowledgeable guy when it comes to a strength and conditioning and

1443
01:19:26.301 --> 01:19:31.301
athletics and he believes that you should do all of your strength workouts and

1444
01:19:31.881 --> 01:19:36.680
you're conditioning workouts like kind of building up to a camp and then when

1445
01:19:36.681 --> 01:19:37.371
you're in camp,

1446
01:19:37.371 --> 01:19:41.510
the majority of your work should be spent doing the actual sport itself.
I,

1447
01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:44.450
without knowing isn't entire protocol.
I agree.
You know,

1448
01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:49.370
on principle and what I do and how I work best is not just overseeing the

1449
01:19:49.371 --> 01:19:51.830
nutrition,
the Diet and the weight cut.
It's,

1450
01:19:51.831 --> 01:19:55.130
I call it the peaking program and I bake it out into the traditional Western

1451
01:19:55.131 --> 01:19:57.530
periodization program.
When I talk about 52 weeks,

1452
01:19:57.531 --> 01:19:59.690
it's a 12 month period as program.

1453
01:19:59.691 --> 01:20:01.700
When I started working with Tiago Alves in 2010,

1454
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:05.840
we came up with a seven year program for him.
Now,

1455
01:20:05.841 --> 01:20:07.860
unfortunately he had some injuries along the way,

1456
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.880
<v 4>but it's transitioning him from the body that he once had and the bad habits</v>

1457
01:20:11.881 --> 01:20:15.420
that he had once had to slowly rebuild,
regenerate,

1458
01:20:15.421 --> 01:20:18.780
and continue building him all the way through until he was 35 when he plans to

1459
01:20:18.781 --> 01:20:22.260
retire and the specific goals that we have set.
So a guy like Nick Lance,

1460
01:20:22.261 --> 01:20:27.150
I took over,
you know,
five or six fights ago when he was at 55 pounder.
Um,

1461
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:29.040
and this,
you know,
it'll be a little long winded,

1462
01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:31.950
but to kind of help explain your,
your answer,
the question here,

1463
01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.890
took him over and he was doing a lot of the wrong things.
Training really hard,

1464
01:20:34.891 --> 01:20:37.650
totally overtrained overreaching syndrome,
constantly malnourished,

1465
01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.570
couldn't understand why his body wasn't losing weight.

1466
01:20:39.571 --> 01:20:43.710
He's walking around in the mid one sixties could barely make fucking 55 without

1467
01:20:43.711 --> 01:20:46.140
damn near Di said,
will I work with him?
I said yes,

1468
01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:48.540
but only at one 45 and he's like,
are you fucking crazy?

1469
01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:53.280
I told you I can't make 55 I said,
you'll be a world champion at one 45.

1470
01:20:53.281 --> 01:20:54.900
I do believe that you're undersized,

1471
01:20:54.901 --> 01:20:57.810
one 55 pound there and you're not training properly.

1472
01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.350
What I want to do with you is I want to add 10 and 12 pounds of muscle and grow

1473
01:21:01.351 --> 01:21:05.160
you into the one 45 pound class.
Blew his mind.
It didn't make any sense to him.

1474
01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:08.610
But to his credit he said Okay and just gave me the reins.

1475
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:12.300
So from that point on I looked at you know multi month cycles,
you know,

1476
01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:15.270
three weeks cycles,
three months cycles,
you know,
and then the 12 years,

1477
01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.970
12 months cycle to put on lean mass.
And what we did,

1478
01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:20.760
we took him from 163 pounds to 175 pounds.

1479
01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:25.620
We dropped his body fat from probably 13 to 14 down to right about 10% and then

1480
01:21:25.621 --> 01:21:28.380
he's able to make one 45 consistently now easily.

1481
01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:33.660
So using Steve's methodology in the off season it's much more volume.

1482
01:21:33.661 --> 01:21:35.640
It's more strength building.
It's more muscle work.

1483
01:21:35.641 --> 01:21:38.760
Not exactly hypertrophy cause I don't really believe in that but we're always

1484
01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:40.830
staying anabolic.
That's the goal.

1485
01:21:40.831 --> 01:21:44.880
We always want the body constantly jet regenerating,
regenerating,
regenerating.

1486
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:47.820
Cause once we start regenerating and they were breaking down and once we start

1487
01:21:47.821 --> 01:21:50.730
breaking down,
everything goes to shit.
So with nick,

1488
01:21:50.731 --> 01:21:51.990
using him as the example again,

1489
01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:55.170
build him up in the off season and that's where I start to break down these

1490
01:21:55.171 --> 01:21:57.810
three week mini cycles,
three weeks before the fight.
That's the peaking phase.

1491
01:21:58.050 --> 01:22:01.530
That's when everything,
the volume drops dramatically.
The intensity goes up,

1492
01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:05.070
but it's safe intensity.
It's not,
you're not sparring,
you're fucking hardest.

1493
01:22:05.071 --> 01:22:06.900
Those last three weeks you're sparring,

1494
01:22:07.050 --> 01:22:11.160
you're most intense and most pro fight precise without that bone on bone

1495
01:22:11.161 --> 01:22:14.580
collision weeks,
you know,
four,
five and six in the middle,

1496
01:22:14.581 --> 01:22:17.790
that's a little bit more medium volume,
maximum intensity.

1497
01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:21.690
That's when you're really getting your hard heart goes to build that,
um,

1498
01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:22.830
you know,
uh,

1499
01:22:22.831 --> 01:22:26.640
ability to withstand the damage that's going to happen in the fight to Callus

1500
01:22:26.641 --> 01:22:28.260
your body over.
And also to Callister mind,

1501
01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:31.080
you have to go through that the three weeks before that.
So that's,
you know,

1502
01:22:31.081 --> 01:22:33.840
seven,
eight,
nine,
that's more of a value in your mind.

1503
01:22:33.841 --> 01:22:37.440
Meaning you're just your resolve.
Like mental toughness,
mental toughness.

1504
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:41.460
I mean we see guys unfortunately that they get into the octagon and they get put

1505
01:22:41.461 --> 01:22:44.970
a bad spot that they haven't been in before and they fault because they haven't

1506
01:22:44.971 --> 01:22:47.760
been there.
You have to go to those spots and fortunately,

1507
01:22:47.761 --> 01:22:51.420
but you have to do it in a very calculated fashion because you go there too

1508
01:22:51.421 --> 01:22:54.390
often.
You'll break and training and you'll give up in the fight.

1509
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:55.710
You don't go there enough,

1510
01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:58.980
you'll break in the fight and again it's going to be the same result so you have

1511
01:22:58.981 --> 01:23:01.920
to touch it just enough.
And this is where that periodization comes in.

1512
01:23:02.130 --> 01:23:05.530
So I help oversee the overall training program.
I help the athlete.

1513
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:07.330
Usually it's spar less.

1514
01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:09.970
I try and pull them back because a lot of these athletes are sparring two and

1515
01:23:09.971 --> 01:23:12.850
three times a week and I try and only have them spa once a week.

1516
01:23:12.851 --> 01:23:15.760
Really from six weeks out.
One good hearts bar,

1517
01:23:15.761 --> 01:23:18.950
proper sport and one text bar is really the methodology that I push,

1518
01:23:18.951 --> 01:23:20.080
save the brain,
save the body,

1519
01:23:20.081 --> 01:23:24.220
let's get more precise and then hit the other hard drilling into certain phases.

1520
01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:26.620
And then as we get farther out and it's more skill building,

1521
01:23:26.650 --> 01:23:30.160
we're looking to just add tools and see what tools fit the overall game,

1522
01:23:30.370 --> 01:23:33.520
you know,
throat 10 different techniques on the grant and see what fits.

1523
01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.830
And as we get a little closer,
we take the 10 we put it to five.

1524
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:36.700
As we get to look closer,

1525
01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:40.210
maybe the athletes aren't going to keep one or two usable techniques that will

1526
01:23:40.211 --> 01:23:41.530
actually show up on fight day.

1527
01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:44.710
We're not trying to add new text techniques six weeks out,

1528
01:23:44.711 --> 01:23:48.220
three weeks out for sure at that point.
It's just fine tuning and perfecting.

1529
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:49.740
But that also comes into their,

1530
01:23:49.741 --> 01:23:53.080
their physical preparation with their body weight.
Like what's the health again?

1531
01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.510
Health is everything.
It's mental health,
it's physical health.

1532
01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:58.120
That's what allows him to perform at their ultimate.

1533
01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:02.770
So long winded way of saying,
I agree with Steve quite a bit.
Strength,

1534
01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:07.360
strength building.
That's off season stuff.
We want to keep that type of strength,

1535
01:24:07.361 --> 01:24:08.740
that explosive strength that you know,

1536
01:24:08.741 --> 01:24:11.550
absolute or maximal strength that we build in the off season.
Well,

1537
01:24:11.551 --> 01:24:12.400
I'm going to keep that,

1538
01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:15.310
but now we want to turn it into a different type of strength,
like a strength,

1539
01:24:15.311 --> 01:24:16.950
speed or speed and Dorrence.
Um,

1540
01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:21.610
as we get into the specific competition and that changes depending on what the

1541
01:24:21.611 --> 01:24:25.420
sport is.
What happened with,
um,
with Charles Olivera,

1542
01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:29.440
Charles Charles over and Nicholas were supposed to fight this past weekend.

1543
01:24:29.441 --> 01:24:33.010
They did not fight cause Allavara showed up heavy and then the day of the fight

1544
01:24:33.011 --> 01:24:36.160
they pulled him.
They said he was sick apparently.
Yeah,
it was.
So I'm going to,

1545
01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:38.380
you're normally,
I don't really pull back the veil,

1546
01:24:38.381 --> 01:24:42.280
but I think because this is such a public,
um,
situation and Oliver and his team,

1547
01:24:42.281 --> 01:24:45.400
they've already spoken on it and unfortunately what they said was incorrect from

1548
01:24:45.401 --> 01:24:48.070
what we saw.
So nick and I,
this fights on Friday,
nick and I,

1549
01:24:48.071 --> 01:24:50.800
we get there on Monday and we're already in the system.

1550
01:24:50.801 --> 01:24:54.160
Nick gets to town at 164 pounds.
He's fighting at one 46.

1551
01:24:54.161 --> 01:24:55.240
That's the official way in weight.

1552
01:24:55.630 --> 01:24:57.790
And that's actually lighter than nick normally is.

1553
01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:01.450
But we tightened up his diet just a little bit for Charles specifically.

1554
01:25:01.451 --> 01:25:02.920
We knew nick was going to overpower him.

1555
01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:05.590
We wanted nick to be just a little bit lighter,
a little bit leaner,

1556
01:25:05.591 --> 01:25:09.150
a little bit faster for this fight in better condition in case it was a fuck or

1557
01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:12.340
three round dog fight.
Um,
Charles called nick out by the way.

1558
01:25:12.341 --> 01:25:14.110
So Charles asked for this fight,
you know,

1559
01:25:14.111 --> 01:25:17.680
after they had had a no contest years before.
So Monday nick and I,

1560
01:25:17.681 --> 01:25:20.920
we started doing our thing,
cutting weight.
Now my athletes don't work out.

1561
01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:25.210
I strongly suggest fight week.
They do not work out.
And a lot of,
you know,

1562
01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:29.770
coaches at all.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
We don't put on the fucking gloves.

1563
01:25:29.771 --> 01:25:33.490
We don't grapple.
We don't hit mits because we're now all that work's done.

1564
01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.530
We're preparing for competition,

1565
01:25:35.531 --> 01:25:38.890
we're pulling the weight at this point and I want to feed the athlete as much as

1566
01:25:38.891 --> 01:25:41.320
possible,
hydrate them as much as possible.

1567
01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:46.300
Keep them as strong and healthy as possible so they can endure the process of

1568
01:25:46.301 --> 01:25:49.750
cutting weight.
Or as I like to frame it positively as purification,

1569
01:25:50.110 --> 01:25:54.280
we're purifying the body as we go through this Monday,
Tuesday,
Wednesday,

1570
01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:58.540
Thursday step on the scale Friday face where the body's completely clean,
pure,

1571
01:25:58.541 --> 01:26:02.140
and we can just put the best possible nutrients back in were saying no working

1572
01:26:02.141 --> 01:26:03.620
out,
you mean nothing?
I mean,
nothing.

1573
01:26:03.621 --> 01:26:06.440
I mean the most that the most that we'll do when I talk about that in three

1574
01:26:06.441 --> 01:26:08.450
weeks to shred it,
what I do with Tiago.
Wow,
this is a great,

1575
01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:12.200
well maybe you should talk about this next.
Um,
Tiago his last fight,
you know,

1576
01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:14.060
he weighed in at one 71 the night before.

1577
01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:17.870
Wayans be using this new protocol that we're using because they're fucking

1578
01:26:17.871 --> 01:26:22.280
healthy.
We're not tearing them down during fight week.
We're actually,

1579
01:26:22.281 --> 01:26:23.900
I build my athletes to the scale.

1580
01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.390
Everybody else tears themselves down to the scale.

1581
01:26:26.391 --> 01:26:30.140
I build my athletes to the scale and it sounds counter intuitive and a lot of

1582
01:26:30.141 --> 01:26:34.250
people think I'm fucking lying or whatever,
you know,
bro,
science and out.
But no,

1583
01:26:34.251 --> 01:26:38.220
this is,
this is the real fucking shit.
Um,
so with nick,
what we do,
and we don't,

1584
01:26:38.230 --> 01:26:38.991
we don't work out.

1585
01:26:38.991 --> 01:26:41.930
We're going downstairs to the hot tub and we're just hanging out.

1586
01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:45.400
He's playing his fucking,
you know,
whatever video games,
cause he's,

1587
01:26:45.401 --> 01:26:46.041
he's a tech head.

1588
01:26:46.041 --> 01:26:48.260
He's playing his fucking games were fucking chilling out to music.

1589
01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.500
We're just shooting the shit like you would deal with your boys just hanging out

1590
01:26:51.501 --> 01:26:52.580
in the hot tub for a little bit.

1591
01:26:52.581 --> 01:26:55.010
Kamozi is coming down and hanging out with Ben Rothwell a little bit.

1592
01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.600
We're just shooting the shit down there.

1593
01:26:56.810 --> 01:27:00.920
Charles and his coach are in the fucking sauna on Monday in plastic.

1594
01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:04.100
Fucking suits and sweat pants.
All God damn.
Day Long.

1595
01:27:04.730 --> 01:27:07.550
Nick and I were in the hot tub for a half hour just to break a sweat,

1596
01:27:07.551 --> 01:27:10.550
drinking water the whole time.
Eat beforehand,
stay hydrated.

1597
01:27:10.551 --> 01:27:12.290
Doring go upstairs and eat again.

1598
01:27:12.291 --> 01:27:15.110
This is what we do and that's what we did typically twice a day during fight

1599
01:27:15.111 --> 01:27:18.770
week.
Every time we went downstairs to the spa,
which was beautiful at this hotel,

1600
01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:21.590
I'm Foxwoods.
Charles was in the fucking Sauna,

1601
01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:24.080
plastics on in the sauna and they would pick him up,

1602
01:27:24.081 --> 01:27:26.660
carry him out and just fucking let him lay in the floor.

1603
01:27:26.661 --> 01:27:29.420
And then they like cover them with towels.
So archaic.

1604
01:27:29.421 --> 01:27:33.050
And this is what a lot of athletes do.
Charles was an extreme example.

1605
01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.550
Now they're doing this on Monday.
I'm doing this on Monday,
man.
Fucking Monday.

1606
01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:40.520
If you're doing that,
maybe it may be.

1607
01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:43.100
I can see athletes doing that like the night before in the morning of,

1608
01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:47.300
they're doing it fucking Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday.

1609
01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:49.490
Now we weighed in on Thursday,
on Wednesday.
And this is fun.

1610
01:27:49.491 --> 01:27:51.740
So we're watching him just break this fucking kid.

1611
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:54.710
He's laying there in the sauna.
I mean just not moving,
you know,

1612
01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:57.590
and he'd get up and you know,
he'd do and he kind of like give us a thumbs up.

1613
01:27:57.591 --> 01:27:59.360
He was a nice kid and nothing bad to say about Charles.

1614
01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:02.600
Nothing bad to say about his coach,
but what they did was wrong.

1615
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:07.460
They broke him in the fucking song.
Nick and I saw it and were like,
you know,

1616
01:28:07.461 --> 01:28:08.181
high five.

1617
01:28:08.181 --> 01:28:11.210
I mean it makes our job a hell of a lot easier cause Nick's fucking great.

1618
01:28:11.211 --> 01:28:13.030
And you know Nick's there.
At one point,
Charles comes in,

1619
01:28:13.050 --> 01:28:16.280
sits in the hot tub at the very end and he's looking at nick and Nick's just

1620
01:28:16.281 --> 01:28:18.980
sitting there and drinking water,
you know,
shooting the shit.

1621
01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:22.820
And Charles over that dry mouth just sucked out big dark bags under his eyes

1622
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:27.680
after being in the fucking sauna for God knows how long and just kind of laid

1623
01:28:27.681 --> 01:28:30.140
out on the wall.
So Wednesday comes in,
this is actually funny.

1624
01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:33.290
Wednesday comes the middle of the day.
Charles is coach.

1625
01:28:33.291 --> 01:28:35.690
They drag them out of the fucking sauna and they're just sitting there.

1626
01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.940
I took a full load,
but I was going to tweet it like what not to do.

1627
01:28:37.941 --> 01:28:41.000
And I was like,
oh,
that's fucking bad.
Maybe I shouldn't do that.

1628
01:28:41.001 --> 01:28:44.420
Maybe it should have,
I don't know.
Um,
he comes over and he's like,
hey guys,

1629
01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:46.430
I have a proposition for you.

1630
01:28:46.431 --> 01:28:48.950
And I think others fucker's not going to make weight.
They want to catch weight.

1631
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:53.060
I have a proposition for you.
Like,
what's up?
He's like,
what?

1632
01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:55.880
You're doing right now.
This,
this is not going to work.
He's like,

1633
01:28:55.881 --> 01:28:58.070
you're not going to lose weight like this in the back.

1634
01:28:58.071 --> 01:29:03.071
I have salt and I have alcohol and I wanted poured in the tub for you so that in

1635
01:29:03.811 --> 01:29:07.890
30 minutes you'll lose the same amount as you'll lose in three hours doing what

1636
01:29:07.891 --> 01:29:12.120
you're doing right now.
I'm thinking,
are you fucking kidding me?

1637
01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:14.190
Salt and alcohol and the water salt.

1638
01:29:14.191 --> 01:29:16.800
And I'm assuming he means Epson salt and rubbing alcohol,

1639
01:29:16.801 --> 01:29:18.300
which is a lot of athletes use.

1640
01:29:18.301 --> 01:29:22.410
And I have the data on that and there's not a discernible difference and there's

1641
01:29:22.411 --> 01:29:25.710
actually negative effects from doing that.
You can touch on that in a,

1642
01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.480
in a second.
So I say to him,
I'm like,
now we're good.
I mean,

1643
01:29:30.481 --> 01:29:34.620
Nick's losing a pound every 15 minutes and we're replacing it the whole time

1644
01:29:34.621 --> 01:29:37.440
because again,
um,
but the data head,
and I track all my athletes.

1645
01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:40.980
I know Johnny Hendricks,
you know,
between 195 185 pounds,

1646
01:29:40.981 --> 01:29:43.920
he lose 1.2 pounds of fluid every 15 minutes.

1647
01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:47.400
I know Nick Lens loses a pound on the door.
I'm gonna stop you right there.
Sorry,

1648
01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.200
I'm confused as fuck you.

1649
01:29:49.201 --> 01:29:52.470
You make him lose weight and then you put it back on.

1650
01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:56.790
Now what we're doing is we're just training the body to sweat,
to sweat,

1651
01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:59.160
to just have the water purifying.
We're purifying,

1652
01:29:59.161 --> 01:30:03.690
pushing out the toxins we're giving them.
Is it distilled water?

1653
01:30:03.691 --> 01:30:07.080
Is Water regular purified water ever drink distilled water.

1654
01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.360
There's some sort of a theory behind that,
right?

1655
01:30:09.361 --> 01:30:13.350
Then you drink a lot of distilled water and it forces your body to release all

1656
01:30:13.351 --> 01:30:16.500
of its electrolytes or something and they leeches your body of all these healthy

1657
01:30:16.501 --> 01:30:18.690
minerals,
electrolytes and such.
The distilled water.

1658
01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:21.750
We don't do that because we're trying to preserve health.
Again,

1659
01:30:21.751 --> 01:30:24.450
we're not trying to,
you get them to lose 30 fucking pounds,

1660
01:30:24.451 --> 01:30:27.570
speed up their metabolism through proper eating,
proper meal size.

1661
01:30:27.570 --> 01:30:29.190
They eat small and often,

1662
01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:33.270
usually it's written down for everybody in the fucking world to read.

1663
01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:35.220
It's small and it's often,

1664
01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:38.280
and it's meals that we've targeted based upon their physiology from the weeks

1665
01:30:38.281 --> 01:30:41.760
beforehand,
meals and ingredients that suit their body.
Um,

1666
01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:46.170
and they just eat consistently.
We play with no carbohydrate,
carbohydrate timing.

1667
01:30:46.171 --> 01:30:49.650
We we play with,
the protein ratio is we keep our fat levels really high.

1668
01:30:49.651 --> 01:30:53.090
We keep carbohydrates in the diet all in fight week.
You know,

1669
01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:55.860
we keep sodium in the Diet for the most part,
most to fight week.

1670
01:30:55.861 --> 01:30:58.830
We elevate and then lower,
but we never dropped completely.
Um,

1671
01:30:58.850 --> 01:30:59.551
and a lot of people,

1672
01:30:59.551 --> 01:31:02.430
they just pull the carbs and they pull the salt and then they just fucking drink

1673
01:31:02.431 --> 01:31:05.970
the distilled water.
How do you get nick?
He's ways in the week he shows up.

1674
01:31:05.971 --> 01:31:09.560
He's one 64.
He's got to get down to one 45.
One 46.
Yep.

1675
01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:12.210
How do you get him to lose that amount of weight in a week?

1676
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:17.220
We speed up as metabolism,
which matters quite a bit.
So he gets tenant one 64.

1677
01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:21.150
So you change his diet the week of we change.
Usually it's,
it's 10 days out.

1678
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:23.460
What we do is 10 days out we increased sodium,

1679
01:31:23.461 --> 01:31:27.690
but not a dramatic amount of what I tell the athletes is add more saltier foods,

1680
01:31:28.140 --> 01:31:31.440
but not so much that it tastes bad.
Just add more than you normally do.

1681
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:34.380
So let's say you're taking it the week beforehand,

1682
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:38.610
so 10 days out typically should be your hardest training session.
Okay?

1683
01:31:38.611 --> 01:31:40.780
Cause any more than 10 days out and now we're too close,

1684
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:42.060
close to the competition time.

1685
01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:45.420
You might not be fully recovered and you're not going to perform at your best.

1686
01:31:45.421 --> 01:31:46.320
So right about 10 days out,

1687
01:31:46.321 --> 01:31:48.600
usually the Tuesday before the fight of the following week.

1688
01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:50.040
That should be the hardest day.

1689
01:31:50.190 --> 01:31:53.250
And then everything else we start to pull way back light and medium workouts,

1690
01:31:53.251 --> 01:31:54.250
much shorter intensities.

1691
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:58.230
It start to increase your sodium just a little bit so you can taste it,

1692
01:31:58.231 --> 01:32:00.280
but it's nothing that you don't like.

1693
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:03.370
Never too much that it's not good and a little bit more to your water.

1694
01:32:03.371 --> 01:32:06.040
And we add pink Himalayan Sea salt.
Love the Onnit brand.
Actually four,

1695
01:32:06.090 --> 01:32:09.970
that's the one I use almost primarily to the water while they're training.

1696
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:10.990
Just add a little bit more.

1697
01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:13.390
So we increased their sodium content just a little bit,

1698
01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:16.150
and then usually depending on the athlete,
Saturday or Sunday,

1699
01:32:16.151 --> 01:32:18.400
sometimes even Monday morning,
we pull that back.

1700
01:32:18.401 --> 01:32:21.400
We don't add any more additional,
we don't add additional salt.

1701
01:32:21.550 --> 01:32:24.490
So we rise as sodium up.
Then we pull it back down to normal levels,

1702
01:32:24.491 --> 01:32:27.340
probably anywhere between one to 2000 milligrams depending on the athlete,

1703
01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:31.300
depending on their lifestyle.
And we really focused on feeding them similar,
uh,

1704
01:32:31.301 --> 01:32:35.770
similar caloric content,
but more often.
So it's basically the same,
you know,

1705
01:32:35.771 --> 01:32:39.400
let's say 2000 calories a day,
but instead of,
you know,
five to six meals,

1706
01:32:39.401 --> 01:32:43.270
now we're eating,
you know,
eight to 10 smaller meals all day long.

1707
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:46.380
The metabolism speeds up.
We're also focusing on more fiber,

1708
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:47.860
cleaning out their digestive track.

1709
01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:51.790
A lot of times athletes will step on the scale with impacted food matters still

1710
01:32:51.791 --> 01:32:55.990
sitting inside of them.
Two,
four,
six pounds.
Who knows?
Is that a real,
that's real.

1711
01:32:55.991 --> 01:32:57.220
Absolutely.
Four to six

1712
01:32:57.250 --> 01:33:01.720
<v 1>pounds of,
that's a lot of stakes apps.
If you looked at six steaks,</v>

1713
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:06.720
that lab six stakes down like six t boned,
16 ounce t bone steak.

1714
01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:08.050
That's a lot of fucking weight

1715
01:33:08.130 --> 01:33:09.580
<v 4>and the fluid that they have,</v>

1716
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:13.090
that food absorbs as the notch in a person's bowels and there.

1717
01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:14.190
But where's it all fit?

1718
01:33:14.250 --> 01:33:18.000
I would estimate they say John Wayne had like 20 some odd paths.
It's bullshit.

1719
01:33:18.030 --> 01:33:20.310
We're not,
it's not true.
True or not,
I don't know.

1720
01:33:20.490 --> 01:33:24.540
But I estimate somewhere up to three pounds of impacted food matter,

1721
01:33:24.541 --> 01:33:28.830
depending on when your last meals where or when you're high protein are harder

1722
01:33:28.831 --> 01:33:29.664
to digest meal as well.

1723
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:32.390
<v 1>I had heard that.
That's bullshit.
The amount of like,</v>

1724
01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:34.670
it's like one of those common myths,

1725
01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:39.820
the amount of impacted food the American average American male has in their gut

1726
01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:43.730
when they die.
We ever read that shit.
There's like a Snopes thing on that.

1727
01:33:43.731 --> 01:33:45.800
Hold on,
I'm gonna pull that up.
But please keep going.

1728
01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:48.450
<v 4>So we speed up their metabolism,
we increase their digest,</v>

1729
01:33:48.451 --> 01:33:52.110
increase their digestive efficiency,
we make sure they are completely clean.

1730
01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:56.130
And then what we focus on is the small sweats.
We keep the body sweating.

1731
01:33:56.131 --> 01:33:57.690
We allow them to be used to sweating,

1732
01:33:57.691 --> 01:34:01.920
but we keep rehydrating them so it's easier for them to keep sweating.

1733
01:34:01.921 --> 01:34:05.700
And these athletes sweat a shitload during this time.

1734
01:34:05.701 --> 01:34:09.900
The only time is when we stop adding water is usually the night before the day

1735
01:34:09.901 --> 01:34:12.690
before Wayne's or on Thursday we stopped somewhere.

1736
01:34:12.691 --> 01:34:16.350
Mid Day Friday we pull the water out and then we'll use what I call the step

1737
01:34:16.351 --> 01:34:20.190
method where it's a very simple way to not break the athlete,

1738
01:34:20.191 --> 01:34:21.990
to keep them sweating properly.

1739
01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:27.030
And the weight again comes off and it's all through hot tub,
hot bath.

1740
01:34:27.090 --> 01:34:29.730
It's never in the salon and my athletes.
So we don't try and fight week.

1741
01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:31.020
We ain't go in the fucking sauna.

1742
01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:34.050
We don't put on plastics unless it's like that last minute.

1743
01:34:34.051 --> 01:34:35.130
It's freezing outside.

1744
01:34:35.131 --> 01:34:38.070
We need to pull off another few ounces on the way to the venue.

1745
01:34:38.071 --> 01:34:41.860
Then we'll throw some plastics on.
Um,
and how much

1746
01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:47.110
<v 1>actual dehydration is it like the though the day of when he wakes up on Friday</v>

1747
01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:50.590
morning,
if it's a Saturday fight,
what does Nick Lens,

1748
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:54.720
<v 4>nick cut three and a half pounds on the day of way in the cit.
That's it.</v>

1749
01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:59.630
He woke up the day before 12 pounds over.
We ate three meals that day.
We,

1750
01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:02.300
I think he drank almost a gallon of water that morning.

1751
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:06.470
And just by drinking the water so frequently it pushes the water out and then we

1752
01:35:06.471 --> 01:35:09.830
cut.
So he woke up.
So one 46,

1753
01:35:09.831 --> 01:35:11.780
I think he woke up around one 50.

1754
01:35:11.781 --> 01:35:15.080
He woke up at one 58 the day before he floated,
you know,

1755
01:35:15.081 --> 01:35:18.560
two pounds off by the time we got to the tub later on that night he went to bed

1756
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:21.830
at one 50,
so we lost about six pounds and that's usually half.

1757
01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:23.360
And that's a good estimate.

1758
01:35:23.361 --> 01:35:26.570
The day before we want to lose about half the night before you're going to float

1759
01:35:26.571 --> 01:35:28.820
one to three pounds.
Typically,
you know,
while you sleep.

1760
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:31.220
And then the next morning is usually two to four pounds.

1761
01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:35.780
So it's very small controlled,
you know,

1762
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:40.310
elimination of wait and it's water weight and he's still eating.

1763
01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:44.270
He's never not eating.
He's still picking.
He's not having these big meals.

1764
01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:46.880
But we go from meals to,
you know,

1765
01:35:46.881 --> 01:35:51.050
kind of snack size to now it's handfuls just to keep as metabolism moving,

1766
01:35:51.051 --> 01:35:53.660
keep his body processing the food,
keep pulling the nutrients,

1767
01:35:53.661 --> 01:35:55.580
keep his blood sugar stable,
keep his brain on,

1768
01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:59.460
keep his mood elevated so it doesn't feel like shit.
Hmm.

1769
01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:05.510
Uh,
according to a Snopes,
John Wayne did not have that much packed,

1770
01:36:05.511 --> 01:36:08.300
impacted in his body,
but Elvis apparently had a lot,

1771
01:36:08.570 --> 01:36:11.510
but it's because he was taking drugs.
He was impacted hack.

1772
01:36:11.511 --> 01:36:14.660
They couldn't get it from the painkillers.
Right.
But I've heard that too.

1773
01:36:14.661 --> 01:36:18.770
That's why I want him to look that up.
Yeah.
It's a,
apparently,
it's like almost,

1774
01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:23.300
you would be in such incredible pain if you had that much food impacted in your

1775
01:36:23.301 --> 01:36:26.960
bowels,
which makes sense.
So if you were to eat,
you know,

1776
01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:31.250
how many pounds of food do you think the average person do it eats in a given

1777
01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:35.570
day?
200 pound guy,
you know,
six pounds,
eight pounds,
maybe 10 pounds of food.

1778
01:36:35.571 --> 01:36:39.620
You wake up at one 90,
you go to bed at one 98 or so.
There's fluid in there,

1779
01:36:39.621 --> 01:36:42.630
but you've pissed and shit out some.
Do you,
um,

1780
01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:46.160
account at all for biological variability like this,

1781
01:36:46.190 --> 01:36:49.940
Nick Lance have a different Diet than say Tiago Alvin?
Yes.
Does he,

1782
01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:55.160
how do you know,
like what to do for each individual?
So we stick with prince.

1783
01:36:55.190 --> 01:36:58.550
The principles never change.
And that's really the scientific base.

1784
01:36:58.551 --> 01:37:02.270
The principles never change,
but the individual application almost always does.

1785
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:06.590
And it changes with the same athlete from fight to fight because the athlete has

1786
01:37:06.591 --> 01:37:10.430
never the same no matter what we're doing in this camp three months,

1787
01:37:10.431 --> 01:37:13.310
six months from now.
It's a different athlete.
It's a different physiology.

1788
01:37:13.311 --> 01:37:15.590
It's a different training pattern.
It's a different mood,

1789
01:37:15.591 --> 01:37:18.950
it's a different lifestyle.
And how,
so give me an example.
Like Tiago Alva.

1790
01:37:18.951 --> 01:37:21.620
So with Tiago,
what we did in the beginning,
you know,

1791
01:37:21.621 --> 01:37:24.680
he missed weight with John Fitch in 2010 I started working with him two days

1792
01:37:24.681 --> 01:37:27.800
later,
brought him down,
fought Jon finch and your John Howard.

1793
01:37:27.801 --> 01:37:31.490
And his weight issue was gone.
So,
and then he had some injuries.

1794
01:37:31.491 --> 01:37:33.320
He had his knees fixed,
he had his shoulders and arm fixed.

1795
01:37:33.321 --> 01:37:36.050
He was on the shelf for two years,
uh,
25 months actually.

1796
01:37:36.230 --> 01:37:41.230
We came back and he fought in Orlando in April and the new and improved Tiago

1797
01:37:41.901 --> 01:37:44.240
had been on the meal plan almost the entire time,

1798
01:37:44.241 --> 01:37:46.310
was eating properly those 52 weeks out of the year.

1799
01:37:46.311 --> 01:37:48.710
And he does his Sunday Fun Day and he has a little barbecue,

1800
01:37:48.711 --> 01:37:51.410
but that's controlled and that's okay.
We allow that to with the gray.

1801
01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:55.070
But he would really follow the meal plan from about 12 weeks when the fight was

1802
01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:55.913
offered.

1803
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.780
<v 2>He went on and he didn't break.
He didn't go off.</v>

1804
01:37:58.080 --> 01:37:59.820
So when I got to him three weeks before the fight,

1805
01:37:59.821 --> 01:38:02.730
and Tiago is one of the few athletes I actually traveled for for an extended

1806
01:38:02.731 --> 01:38:03.541
period of time anymore.

1807
01:38:03.541 --> 01:38:06.960
And I went and stayed with him and he was one 96 or one 98 three weeks before

1808
01:38:06.961 --> 01:38:09.030
the fight jacked probably,
you know,

1809
01:38:09.150 --> 01:38:13.290
8% 9% body fat slow and he's fucking looked awesome.

1810
01:38:13.291 --> 01:38:15.930
Slowly but surely I tighten up his diet.
You know,

1811
01:38:15.931 --> 01:38:17.850
I tightened the wheels and the switches just a little bit.

1812
01:38:17.851 --> 01:38:22.851
Really made sure he was getting enough food to fuel but not enough to spill

1813
01:38:22.951 --> 01:38:25.380
over.
And we were able to slowly bring his weight down to the lower.

1814
01:38:25.450 --> 01:38:30.450
Nowadays if he's 8% body fat lowering his body weight.

1815
01:38:30.930 --> 01:38:33.780
Yup.
What do you,
are you causing atrophy?
Like what are you doing?

1816
01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:35.250
To a degree we're trying to,

1817
01:38:35.251 --> 01:38:39.060
with him we're trying to eliminate a little bit of muscle or reduce some of the

1818
01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:43.830
muscle volume that he has and that's it's all water weight cause you can tell

1819
01:38:43.831 --> 01:38:46.820
that he definitely looks slimmer.
And when he fought Seth Bazinsky,

1820
01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:49.080
he looked great,
he looked awesome,
fought great.

1821
01:38:49.081 --> 01:38:52.320
He had a great gas tank at me and he looked really good in that fight.

1822
01:38:52.530 --> 01:38:53.400
But that was,

1823
01:38:53.401 --> 01:38:57.670
I found it fascinating that he weighed so little a day before the fight.
Yup.

1824
01:38:57.930 --> 01:39:00.480
When he entered into the cage,
what did he weigh?
One 94.

1825
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:05.910
So how are you doing that?
So pulling him down the same exact principle,

1826
01:39:05.911 --> 01:39:10.440
different foods for Tiago than what lance eight Tiago is much more of a,
um,
uh,

1827
01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:14.610
protein and fat metabolizer.
Nick Lens is much more of a,

1828
01:39:14.611 --> 01:39:18.270
of vegetable and produce metabolizer.
Um,
they perform better.

1829
01:39:18.271 --> 01:39:21.060
All their analytics are much better when they have those types of foods and that

1830
01:39:21.061 --> 01:39:24.750
just comes through experience working with these guys.
So Tiago was more heavy.

1831
01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:28.410
It was,
you know,
chicken and steak and eggs,
Avocados,
you know,

1832
01:39:28.411 --> 01:39:32.160
different types of oils and seeds to really bring him down anytime he has,

1833
01:39:32.161 --> 01:39:35.130
you know,
the heavier carbs outside of the breakfast bowl,
oats in such,

1834
01:39:35.131 --> 01:39:36.120
Barry's first thing in the morning,

1835
01:39:36.450 --> 01:39:38.880
he tends to blow it up and really hold on in that water.

1836
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:42.870
So we slowly eliminate that and he said no pastas for him or things along those

1837
01:39:42.871 --> 01:39:43.111
lines.

1838
01:39:43.111 --> 01:39:48.111
I think we did pasta probably two weeks out where we do what's a refeed,

1839
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:50.270
you know,
every,
you know,
uh,

1840
01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:53.220
once a week we'll do a refit where we go really high carbohydrate,

1841
01:39:53.221 --> 01:39:56.580
but we'll stage that with a lower carb carbohydrates either before or right

1842
01:39:56.581 --> 01:39:59.910
after.
Um,
so we'll do the refit definitely once a week,

1843
01:39:59.911 --> 01:40:02.100
sometimes twice a week depending on how close we are.

1844
01:40:02.130 --> 01:40:03.810
And what's the benefits of a refeed?

1845
01:40:03.811 --> 01:40:07.710
It's to refill the body of loss glycogen to make sure that usable energy is

1846
01:40:07.711 --> 01:40:09.160
available.
Um,

1847
01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:13.380
and it's also a mood elevator cause a lot of times the athlete starts to get a

1848
01:40:13.381 --> 01:40:14.214
little,
you know,

1849
01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:17.460
shitty if they're not getting more carbohydrates in the brain runs on

1850
01:40:17.461 --> 01:40:18.750
carbohydrates also.

1851
01:40:18.751 --> 01:40:22.500
So you can see the mood kind of deep decreased just a little bit.

1852
01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:23.550
And also performance,

1853
01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:27.540
like working with Manny can Burean right now to drop him from 45 to one 35.

1854
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:29.160
Got Him on the first program,

1855
01:40:29.161 --> 01:40:33.750
the initial program and it was just a little bit too low carbohydrate and he's

1856
01:40:33.751 --> 01:40:35.580
like,
ah,
his mood was down just a little bit.

1857
01:40:35.581 --> 01:40:37.410
He didn't feel that snap and practice.

1858
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:40.590
And we really just brought him up about a hundred extra carbohydrates per day

1859
01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.420
and he fucking felt amazing.

1860
01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:47.370
So it was really trying to find the line that is exactly what they need without

1861
01:40:47.371 --> 01:40:50.760
spilling over.
And once we got that,
we got them feeling good for 10 days,

1862
01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:53.980
we're able to stage it down just a little bit and he even better.

1863
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:57.910
So now we're slowly in in that last three week phase,
the peaking phase.
And he's,

1864
01:40:58.070 --> 01:41:01.210
you know,
now he's like 148 pounds yesterday,

1865
01:41:01.211 --> 01:41:05.310
which his last fight for him to get under one 55 he felt like he was going to

1866
01:41:05.311 --> 01:41:08.020
die.
So now he's training at one 48 feels fucking amazing.

1867
01:41:08.021 --> 01:41:12.550
Fully fed six plus meals a day,
but everything's kind of perfectly controlled.

1868
01:41:13.210 --> 01:41:14.360
Wow.
So this product

1869
01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:16.100
<v 1>called that you do,
you make,</v>

1870
01:41:16.101 --> 01:41:19.310
you make a specific one for each fighter and you sort of work with them,

1871
01:41:19.370 --> 01:41:20.151
same principles.

1872
01:41:20.151 --> 01:41:25.151
What happened with Bj Penn because Bj Penn subset with you after his fight and

1873
01:41:25.821 --> 01:41:29.690
you know,
set a lot of shit in the press and just really wasn't happy with it.

1874
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:33.560
Yeah.
He said his exact quote was without the ivy,

1875
01:41:33.710 --> 01:41:35.720
you're nothing like he,

1876
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:40.750
he wanted to not use intravenous fluid retention.

1877
01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:44.030
He didn't want to get an ivy to rehydrate.
Yeah,

1878
01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:48.710
<v 2>he,
the Ivy was available and ready and the doctor was on call and he didn't want</v>

1879
01:41:48.711 --> 01:41:52.640
the IB and I didn't even want an ivy.
He didn't say,
well,
no,
that's not true.

1880
01:41:52.670 --> 01:41:54.770
Days before he had said he'd never used one before.

1881
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:56.480
He was worried about how he would feel.

1882
01:41:56.810 --> 01:42:00.230
He said he would play it by ear if he did feel like he needed one,

1883
01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:04.850
but he didn't cut any weight and that's why I didn't disagree with him.

1884
01:42:04.851 --> 01:42:05.930
Now he runs the show.

1885
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:11.470
He's the boss of the camp period at the end of story and that was very clear.

1886
01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.890
He didn't want the ivy and I didn't disagree with him because he didn't cut it.

1887
01:42:15.891 --> 01:42:20.090
Announce he was eating and drinking on Wayne Day,

1888
01:42:20.091 --> 01:42:24.110
walking over to lance.
This is not an athlete that was dehydrated.

1889
01:42:24.230 --> 01:42:28.010
It was not an athlete that was suffering.
It was an athlete that looked amazing,

1890
01:42:28.011 --> 01:42:31.100
was bouncing around talking to everybody full of energy.

1891
01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:34.400
Did he need an IV?
You know,
I'm not a doctor,

1892
01:42:34.401 --> 01:42:38.180
but he didn't want the doctor to come to administer it and I have to rely on the

1893
01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:41.240
the athlete,
you know,
it's his body.
It's his choice.

1894
01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:43.790
He said he'd never used one before.
He didn't want one.

1895
01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:48.620
He felt great as what he had said.
Perfect.
Well here's shit a shit.

1896
01:42:48.621 --> 01:42:53.621
Load a house full of food and fluid and everything that you need to consume,

1897
01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:58.100
so enjoy it.
Now that same fight card I worked with Ronda Rousey.

1898
01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:02.150
Ronda Rousey didn't use an Ivi there and she cut over 10 pounds.

1899
01:43:02.570 --> 01:43:05.930
She never ivs.
She had never used one before,
a little nervous to use it.

1900
01:43:05.931 --> 01:43:06.800
Chose not to use it,

1901
01:43:06.801 --> 01:43:11.780
didn't use it and went out there and look like Rhonda always looks because she's

1902
01:43:11.781 --> 01:43:14.600
just never had it before.
Now,
if she had used one,

1903
01:43:14.601 --> 01:43:18.200
maybe she would've looked even better or maybe it would have thrown her off her

1904
01:43:18.230 --> 01:43:20.780
fight last 10 seconds.
I know when she fought me,

1905
01:43:20.781 --> 01:43:23.630
she take her fight lasted into the third round and me,

1906
01:43:23.631 --> 01:43:26.300
she's a very well conditioned athlete.
One of the better conditions,

1907
01:43:26.301 --> 01:43:30.580
female athletes in the game.
And Rhonda looked amazing and that was a scrap,
not,

1908
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:34.310
not at one point that Rhonda looked like she was at a loss and she had no ivs,

1909
01:43:34.490 --> 01:43:37.820
no ivy in that fight.
And how much did she cut?
Now she cuts about 10 pounds.

1910
01:43:37.821 --> 01:43:39.200
She gets in,

1911
01:43:39.201 --> 01:43:43.130
she's fights at 35 usually she'll get down into the lower forties just that day

1912
01:43:43.131 --> 01:43:45.230
before me.
She's getting the fight week,

1913
01:43:45.231 --> 01:43:48.370
usually between 48 and 50 and she does most of her training and the loaf.

1914
01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:49.580
How did Bj,
Hey,
get

1915
01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:52.190
<v 1>down to 145 pounds.
Bj is a guy</v>

1916
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:56.220
<v 2>who fought at one 70 because he didn't like making one 55 yeah.</v>

1917
01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:01.340
So all of a sudden we see Bj training getting ready and he looked so thin.

1918
01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:04.760
And what did he do?
He was back when we film the ultimate fighter,

1919
01:44:04.761 --> 01:44:09.440
he was 162 pounds.
He was in a low one sixties back then when and then they,

1920
01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:12.500
they broke off communication with me.
You know,

1921
01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:15.860
after the ultimate fighter was over,
I didn't hear from anybody from their team,

1922
01:44:15.861 --> 01:44:19.130
their camp until the very end of May,

1923
01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:23.330
which is just a few weeks before fight week and they were in a bit of crisis

1924
01:44:23.331 --> 01:44:24.164
mode.

1925
01:44:24.170 --> 01:44:28.880
Now I didn't get to Hawaii to first actually,
you know,

1926
01:44:28.881 --> 01:44:33.140
be a part of the camp and the team until June the ninth,

1927
01:44:33.141 --> 01:44:35.840
which is less than a month before the fight.
And when I got there,

1928
01:44:35.841 --> 01:44:39.950
Bj had said he weighs,
so wait,
what do you weight champ?
157 pounds.

1929
01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:43.820
But I went out last night with Dominick Cruz and we had some pizza and I weighed

1930
01:44:43.821 --> 01:44:47.510
one 57 today.
And I'm thinking,
fuck,

1931
01:44:47.511 --> 01:44:52.370
why do you need me to be here?
You know,
the fucking,
you know,

1932
01:44:52.410 --> 01:44:55.790
dolce diet dude,
if you're 157 pounds,

1933
01:44:55.791 --> 01:45:00.020
I mean you're 10 pounds over what the weight class is after eating some bad
shit,

1934
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:05.210
you're probably closer to 55 54 I'm assuming.
So it was kind of,

1935
01:45:05.211 --> 01:45:09.140
it was an anomaly.
It was really an odd situation.
Um,
how did he lose the weight?

1936
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:11.690
You know,
just eating a little more peace,

1937
01:45:11.691 --> 01:45:14.900
paid more attention to his food as he got closer to the fight.

1938
01:45:14.901 --> 01:45:17.690
Those last couple of weeks I was there,
I didn't prepare any meals for them.

1939
01:45:17.691 --> 01:45:20.330
I stayed in a completely different location.
He stayed in one area.

1940
01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:24.230
I stayed a few miles away in another area.
It was a weird situation,

1941
01:45:24.231 --> 01:45:26.350
was one of the oddest training camps I had ever been a part of.

1942
01:45:26.370 --> 01:45:29.380
And I was there for less than two weeks.
Physically in Hawaiian,

1943
01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:33.290
had very little influence unfortunately.

1944
01:45:33.291 --> 01:45:35.870
And I made some very strong suggestions and I made,
you know,

1945
01:45:35.871 --> 01:45:40.010
very strong observations to members of the team of what I saw and what I am

1946
01:45:40.011 --> 01:45:42.500
accustomed to and what I think would really benefit.

1947
01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:45.730
What did you have issue with?
Um,
it was the training,
you know,

1948
01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:50.090
frequency and just the training frequency.
Yeah.
I don't believe it was enough.

1949
01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:53.450
It wasn't training enough that for all the other athletes that I work with

1950
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:54.560
trained much more often.

1951
01:45:55.190 --> 01:45:58.550
And it was Bj training once a day,

1952
01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:00.320
but not quite every day.

1953
01:46:01.130 --> 01:46:05.220
And the type of training was less.
There was no,
and then we'll,

1954
01:46:05.221 --> 01:46:07.520
we'll just compare it to Frankie Edgar's team and I'll,

1955
01:46:07.521 --> 01:46:10.640
Frankie Edgar has Mark Henry there who's a worldclass striking coach.

1956
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.940
He has Steve Rivera there who's one of the top wrestling coaches in the country

1957
01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:15.290
and then he has a Carlisle NATO.

1958
01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:19.460
There is one of the top Brazilian Jiu Jitsu coaches,
practitioners in the world.

1959
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:24.110
And then frank has got a shit load of UFC level guys that he's training with on

1960
01:46:24.111 --> 01:46:26.600
a daily basis.
And BJ had none of that.

1961
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:32.390
He had a coach who was a nice man who from my understanding has no experience in

1962
01:46:32.391 --> 01:46:35.970
boxing or coaching.
You know,

1963
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.840
professional athletes certainly don't have a worldclass UFC MMA level.

1964
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:42.590
There was no wrestling coach there and you know,
the only,

1965
01:46:42.591 --> 01:46:43.790
the top level Jujitsu guys,

1966
01:46:43.791 --> 01:46:47.390
of course Bj who's very accoladed but his brothers were there and it didn't seem

1967
01:46:47.391 --> 01:46:52.391
like they had any influence as far as technical proficiency or strategy or you

1968
01:46:53.261 --> 01:46:56.580
know,
game plan or training.
And it was,
you know,
minimal.

1969
01:46:56.581 --> 01:46:59.370
The only training camps there of,
you know,
training partners,

1970
01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:01.770
their value where the two guys I brought in at the last minute,

1971
01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:05.820
which was Nick Lands in Merseyside backtick now lens left very,
you know,

1972
01:47:05.821 --> 01:47:08.520
he got there and he left because he didn't want to be there.

1973
01:47:08.521 --> 01:47:11.700
He didn't feel like it was going to be a good training environment for him.

1974
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.540
So he left early and then Massaad stayed.
But Marsan,
you know,
a young,

1975
01:47:15.541 --> 01:47:18.270
tough kid and Marcel was actually a great training partner for Bj and really

1976
01:47:18.271 --> 01:47:20.820
tried to do his best to mimic what Frankie was going to do.

1977
01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:25.560
So it was a tough situation.
Is it one of those situations where

1978
01:47:25.930 --> 01:47:28.870
<v 1>in all fairness,
Bj,
who's a great champion,</v>

1979
01:47:28.871 --> 01:47:33.871
who's a real MMA legend is almost too strong of a personality to be coached

1980
01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:38.680
because he's been so successful and because he's been such a destroyer that

1981
01:47:38.681 --> 01:47:42.070
points in his career that he has something in his head and who the fuck are you

1982
01:47:42.071 --> 01:47:43.420
to tell Bj Penn what to do?

1983
01:47:43.870 --> 01:47:47.670
<v 2>That could be,
that could be.
It was very,
I,
you know,</v>

1984
01:47:48.370 --> 01:47:52.690
I don't know why there was no coaches there that we're able to truly make

1985
01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:54.730
influenced the suggestions that I made were,

1986
01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:00.000
and I made them officially and they were accepted but not responded or reacted

1987
01:48:00.341 --> 01:48:03.490
to.
And it was just a matter of,
you know,
this is,

1988
01:48:03.970 --> 01:48:07.330
that's the direction he's choosing to go and he's either going to win and look

1989
01:48:07.331 --> 01:48:10.360
like a fucking genius or he's going to not win.

1990
01:48:10.361 --> 01:48:11.860
And he's gonna make the odd makers look like a Jean.

1991
01:48:11.950 --> 01:48:15.220
<v 1>In all fairness.
There's other issues besides diet.</v>

1992
01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:19.480
There was also his upright boxing style that confused the shit out of a lot of

1993
01:48:19.481 --> 01:48:21.280
people.
No one,
no one understood.

1994
01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:26.460
He had this narrow stance and he stood completely straight up.

1995
01:48:26.831 --> 01:48:29.440
It was very odd.
And,
uh,

1996
01:48:29.441 --> 01:48:32.050
when he was asked about it,

1997
01:48:32.170 --> 01:48:35.510
he said that it was very effective for them and training and that,
uh,

1998
01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:36.840
it had been,
uh,

1999
01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:42.270
they came up with it to somehow or another reserve energy.

2000
01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:46.840
So by not lowering his body weight,
body,

2001
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:51.870
meaning by not lowering his stance and pushing off of his legs more by standing

2002
01:48:51.881 --> 01:48:54.100
up straight,
he would extend less energy.

2003
01:48:54.101 --> 01:48:57.940
It would be less difficult for him to do.
I found that incredibly bizarre.

2004
01:48:58.690 --> 01:49:02.080
And the last thing you should ever be thinking about if you're about to fight

2005
01:49:02.081 --> 01:49:06.550
Frankie fucking Edgar is conserving energy.
I mean,
God damn you,

2006
01:49:06.551 --> 01:49:10.930
you better be ready to go balls to the wall for five fucking rounds because

2007
01:49:10.931 --> 01:49:12.220
Frankie is going to

2008
01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:15.420
<v 2>Frankie's going to,
yeah,
when we were on the ultimate fighter setting,
October,</v>

2009
01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:20.720
Frankie was training twice a day himself and then he was training twice with the

2010
01:49:20.731 --> 01:49:21.900
athletes on the,
the show.

2011
01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:26.430
Frankie was seen in every gym in Las Vegas training with their best and top guys

2012
01:49:26.431 --> 01:49:29.490
and he was surrounded by his coaches the entire time.
I mean,

2013
01:49:29.491 --> 01:49:33.960
that's who frank is and that's who I knew Bj was going to be competing against.

2014
01:49:34.150 --> 01:49:36.690
Bj was at his best when he was at the,
sorry to interrupt you,

2015
01:49:36.691 --> 01:49:40.320
but was with the Marinovich has agreed,
agreed.
And Erna bitches and uh,

2016
01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:43.950
Jason Parillo was working on his striking who was visiting Bisbing striking

2017
01:49:43.951 --> 01:49:48.040
coach and they were able to really put together great performances sherk

2018
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.730
<v 1>and Diego and Joe Stevenson.
And that was,</v>

2019
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:53.320
that was prime be amazing.

2020
01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:57.520
I don't know why that there was the dramatic shift in change and in training

2021
01:49:57.521 --> 01:50:01.570
protocols and saw and style.
It says he wants what he wanted to do I guess.

2022
01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:03.340
And that speeds.
He's the boss.

2023
01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:08.170
It's so hard when you're a fan of a guy like that where you,

2024
01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:13.150
you almost want to just be able to like get inside of his head and just,

2025
01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:17.920
you know,
man,
if you had like a Matt Hume type coach,

2026
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:20.170
someone that you could completely listened to,

2027
01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:23.860
someone that you trusted and respected enough to run your entire camp,

2028
01:50:23.890 --> 01:50:26.620
this is the guy is going to tell you what your strength and conditioning

2029
01:50:26.621 --> 01:50:28.720
protocol is.
This is the guy who's going to tell you what,

2030
01:50:28.721 --> 01:50:31.460
what kind of sparring you're going to do.
This is the kind of,
uh,

2031
01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:33.400
just drilling you're going to do.

2032
01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:35.200
You're going to do all this stuff that this guy says,

2033
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:40.740
a guy like Bj Penn would almost be unstoppable.
Absolutely.
It's hard band.

2034
01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:41.630
It's,
it's,
it's,

2035
01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:46.660
it's really a fascinating sport in that this sport has evolved before our eyes.

2036
01:50:47.531 --> 01:50:52.150
And we've seen the training like change and move and adjust.

2037
01:50:52.151 --> 01:50:55.960
And it's one of the reasons why I brought up the idea of whether or not people

2038
01:50:55.961 --> 01:51:00.300
have unreal expectations because of it performance enhancing drugs.
Cause it's,

2039
01:51:00.301 --> 01:51:03.730
it's,
it's very confusing and a lot of ways people there,

2040
01:51:03.731 --> 01:51:07.240
everyone's sort of imitating the successful behavior they see around them.

2041
01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:10.870
You know,
this guy uses ropes,
he swings ropes around.
I got to get some ropes.

2042
01:51:11.190 --> 01:51:14.800
You know,
this guy likes to fucking use a tire and a sledgehammer.
Fuck,

2043
01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:18.760
I need a tire.
You know,
it's everywhere.
Yeah.
I mean that's what we see.

2044
01:51:18.761 --> 01:51:23.440
We see everyone sort of imitating what successful and what people have done

2045
01:51:23.441 --> 01:51:24.550
successfully before them.

2046
01:51:24.670 --> 01:51:27.190
And then this guys like fate or they're confused the shit out of her body cause

2047
01:51:27.191 --> 01:51:31.810
he's throwing rocks at fucking throwing punches with little hand weights.

2048
01:51:31.811 --> 01:51:36.130
And that's basically all you ever see from them.
Yeah.
You know,
it's,
it's weird.

2049
01:51:36.610 --> 01:51:40.900
It's a weird sport and that it's not like pro football where you know,

2050
01:51:40.901 --> 01:51:44.730
you go back to the Jim Brown error and need change to today.
You know,

2051
01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:49.740
you've seen 50 years of evolution and it's all sort of culminated in the last

2052
01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:52.810
couple of decades and you see science and nutrition and strength and

2053
01:51:52.811 --> 01:51:55.330
conditioning protocols of all sort of adjusted.

2054
01:51:55.630 --> 01:51:58.660
But with MMA it's not just running,

2055
01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:03.900
it's not just moving left and moving right at the same time you're learning the

2056
01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:08.710
thousand plus possibilities of any Jujitsu match your learning,

2057
01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:13.740
the 500 plus possibilities of any combinations and kickboxing,

2058
01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:16.600
you know,
you're learning so many skills.

2059
01:52:16.750 --> 01:52:19.390
The combination of wrestling and judo,

2060
01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:21.770
the combination of Jujitsu,

2061
01:52:21.790 --> 01:52:24.850
sambo catch wrestling and the combination of,

2062
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:26.770
I mean there's just so many variables.

2063
01:52:26.771 --> 01:52:31.450
There's so much shit to learn on top of all the strength and conditioning.

2064
01:52:31.451 --> 01:52:35.410
So it's not as simple as this guy needs to learn how to squat 500 pounds and

2065
01:52:35.411 --> 01:52:39.340
fucking push that sled.
Yeah,
no,
this is a lot of other shit you have to do too.

2066
01:52:39.341 --> 01:52:42.100
And if you do too much of one and not enough of the other,

2067
01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:46.010
you won't be at your best.
It's this combination,
the strength

2068
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.950
<v 2>and conditioning and of being,
you know,</v>

2069
01:52:48.951 --> 01:52:53.180
a guy who understands all the variables of mixed martial arts as well.

2070
01:52:53.210 --> 01:52:56.660
Absolutely.
It's,
it's almost like no one really knows how to do it yet.

2071
01:52:56.870 --> 01:53:00.740
It's still young.
I mean we're still evolving.
You know,
as a sport though,

2072
01:53:00.741 --> 01:53:03.650
people have been fighting for years never like this and never at this level,

2073
01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:05.540
never with so much on the line,
you know,

2074
01:53:05.541 --> 01:53:10.270
multimillions of dollars available now for the top dog.
So there's a,

2075
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:12.530
as a race and that's obviously what brings in the PE,

2076
01:53:12.650 --> 01:53:17.150
but it's also what's pushes athletes like Rhonda Rousey forward to constantly

2077
01:53:17.151 --> 01:53:21.350
evolve and work on her striking more and find new ways to dye it and do strength

2078
01:53:21.351 --> 01:53:25.220
and conditioning better and use her mental visualization approaches to really

2079
01:53:25.221 --> 01:53:30.020
make sure she can be at the,
you know,
the top of that cresting wave.

2080
01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:33.170
So she's not getting stuck behind that.
She's really at the forefront.

2081
01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:35.330
And when athletes like that,
it's a,

2082
01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:39.080
it's a crazy time when it comes to these things.
It really is a crazy time.

2083
01:53:39.580 --> 01:53:43.130
And the thing about the performing in sands,

2084
01:53:43.190 --> 01:53:46.310
the performance enhancing drugs,
I mean they exist in all sports of course,

2085
01:53:46.610 --> 01:53:51.440
but in MMA it's almost like there's not enough time in the day to do everything.

2086
01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:55.340
There's so many different things that you have to be on top of that an athlete

2087
01:53:55.341 --> 01:53:58.130
almost doesn't have the time or the physical resources,

2088
01:53:58.131 --> 01:54:01.760
like their body can't do all the work that's required and that's where

2089
01:54:01.761 --> 01:54:02.840
puritization comes in.

2090
01:54:03.050 --> 01:54:06.560
That way you're able to segment what we're going to be working on for this three

2091
01:54:06.561 --> 01:54:10.700
week phase and then we're going to work on something different but synergistic

2092
01:54:10.701 --> 01:54:14.300
on the next three week phase and we're slowly going to be the best possible

2093
01:54:14.301 --> 01:54:17.240
version of ourself at that time.

2094
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:20.660
When we step into the octagon or step into the competition circle and then it

2095
01:54:20.661 --> 01:54:22.730
all starts over again and we look to add more tools.

2096
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:25.880
One of the other things that Bj's camp said was that you kind of restricted the

2097
01:54:25.881 --> 01:54:29.330
amount of food that he ate.
The day of the fight is not true and there's a line,

2098
01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:32.330
a lot of the things unfortunately that said we're factually incorrect and I

2099
01:54:32.331 --> 01:54:34.670
chose not to comment.

2100
01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:37.670
This is the first time I'm even commenting about it and I went on,

2101
01:54:37.671 --> 01:54:40.280
I'd go to the on the underground everyday and a lot of the people in the

2102
01:54:40.281 --> 01:54:43.100
underground seemed to have a pretty good take on what the reality of the

2103
01:54:43.101 --> 01:54:46.340
situation was and I didn't feel the need to personally comment.

2104
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:51.260
And what I'm going to say is that there he had a house full of food.

2105
01:54:51.470 --> 01:54:56.210
I personally brought over tons of amazing food that was available.

2106
01:54:56.330 --> 01:55:00.950
He was two minutes from a whole foods next that was right down the street from

2107
01:55:00.951 --> 01:55:04.280
him.
You know,
there's his house had,
you know,
shit,

2108
01:55:04.590 --> 01:55:08.540
10 gallons of water in it and a gallon of coconut water and a full running

2109
01:55:08.541 --> 01:55:12.260
faucet and there's sea salt everywhere.
And you know,
just,
you know,
a big,

2110
01:55:12.261 --> 01:55:17.261
I brought up the huge vat of the power pasta with grass fed beef and all the

2111
01:55:18.110 --> 01:55:22.040
organic,
what is that?
Power Pasta?
It's,
it's a brown rice pasta.
So it's,

2112
01:55:22.041 --> 01:55:25.310
it's a higher carbohydrate content food.
And it was,

2113
01:55:25.490 --> 01:55:28.460
I made two 16 ounce boxes of it,

2114
01:55:28.461 --> 01:55:32.470
which would basically feed like a family of four really fucking big dudes or you

2115
01:55:32.471 --> 01:55:34.190
know,
the family of six or so,

2116
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:37.460
two pounds of grass fed ground beef was mixed up in there and just,

2117
01:55:37.670 --> 01:55:38.870
and they'd like to peppers,

2118
01:55:38.930 --> 01:55:41.210
two red peppers and two green and two red onions and you know,

2119
01:55:41.211 --> 01:55:44.010
just really high quality nutrients and you know,
a

2120
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:48.510
<v 3>full fucking smoothie,
massive,
you know,
handful of Kale,
handful of spinach,</v>

2121
01:55:48.511 --> 01:55:51.060
handful of Redgrave's,
handful of blueberries,
handful of strawberries.

2122
01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:54.660
So you didn't,
you don't restrict their calories at all.
The day of the fight.

2123
01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:59.190
I don't restrict anything.
And again,
I had very little influence,

2124
01:55:59.550 --> 01:56:03.480
very little influence and that's,
that's clear.
I br I was more like a,

2125
01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:06.870
I was a chef.
I would bring some really delicious food and you know,

2126
01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:09.960
some things would get eaten and some things wouldn't.
It was nothing.

2127
01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:13.740
I was saying don't eat this or don't do that.
And everything was available.

2128
01:56:13.741 --> 01:56:15.720
And who was saying that you had restricted as food?

2129
01:56:15.721 --> 01:56:18.330
Because that was one of the big things that was going around and know a lot of

2130
01:56:18.331 --> 01:56:21.370
it's just internet hearsay and somebody hears things and they create a thread.

2131
01:56:21.410 --> 01:56:24.510
People in his camp wasn't it?
It wasn't anybody in his camp.

2132
01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:29.510
It was people that seemed like people from his area or information was fed to

2133
01:56:29.611 --> 01:56:30.900
them by somebody.

2134
01:56:30.901 --> 01:56:34.920
And I'm not really going to speculate because it's not worth my time to comment

2135
01:56:34.921 --> 01:56:38.550
and I don't want to turn it into anything bigger.
I understand,
but it just,

2136
01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:42.500
it was factually completely false and incorrect.
And I spoke with very,
you know,

2137
01:56:42.530 --> 01:56:45.620
high ranking members of his team and we've had,
you know,
this,

2138
01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:50.010
the factual conversations,
we're all in alignment as to exactly what happens,

2139
01:56:50.011 --> 01:56:52.020
which is a really nice thing,
but it's kind of the,

2140
01:56:52.021 --> 01:56:56.550
the public conversation that just continues on and that's just not correct.

2141
01:56:56.610 --> 01:56:59.880
So do you think that what happens is after fighter loses they,
I mean,

2142
01:57:00.530 --> 01:57:03.260
it's an interesting thing that happened with Travis Browne.
Um,

2143
01:57:03.330 --> 01:57:06.270
Travis bound to this intro interview and I really love Travis.

2144
01:57:06.271 --> 01:57:09.000
I think he's an awesome guy.
I think he's a great fighter,

2145
01:57:09.001 --> 01:57:11.250
but he's also super honest,
which I thought was really cool.

2146
01:57:11.550 --> 01:57:15.810
And he said that after he lost to Fabricio for doom,
he said,
he goes,

2147
01:57:15.811 --> 01:57:20.790
I went through the whole process.
I blamed myself.
I blamed everybody around me.

2148
01:57:20.791 --> 01:57:25.620
I blamed,
you know,
I took turns blaming people.
He goes,
I fucking cried.

2149
01:57:25.621 --> 01:57:29.280
I did the whole deal.
And then I figured out,
all right,
what do I need to work on?

2150
01:57:29.310 --> 01:57:33.630
What do I need to change?
What do I need to just,
he's working with Edmond.
Uh,

2151
01:57:33.730 --> 01:57:38.130
Ron does a trainer on his striking and trying to tone things up and change some

2152
01:57:38.131 --> 01:57:42.330
things and learn some new skills and learn some new variables that he could add

2153
01:57:42.331 --> 01:57:45.600
to his fight game.
But what I love about the fact that he was,

2154
01:57:45.630 --> 01:57:50.070
he was honest about how after the fight there's this instinct to sort of blame,

2155
01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:55.680
blame himself,
blame others,
rotate,
you know,
no,
fuck it.

2156
01:57:55.681 --> 01:58:00.570
It was everybody else's fault.
It wasn't me.
And,
um,
after the BJ fight,

2157
01:58:00.571 --> 01:58:04.740
I kept hearing all this shit about,
you know,
blaming Mike Dolce and like,
man,

2158
01:58:05.010 --> 01:58:10.010
how much fucking impact can a guy who's telling you what to eat have on how you

2159
01:58:10.231 --> 01:58:10.860
fight?

2160
01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:15.860
Because what I saw in that cage was a guy getting overwhelmed by a guy with a

2161
01:58:16.471 --> 01:58:20.760
fucking incredible gas tank with a better strategy by the number two guy in the

2162
01:58:20.761 --> 01:58:25.680
world who has two wins over him previously.
So,

2163
01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:29.760
you know,
there's just bad matchups.
Right?
And that maybe that was one of it.

2164
01:58:29.761 --> 01:58:32.400
Frank has been more active.
He's was the number two guy in the world at the time.

2165
01:58:32.670 --> 01:58:36.900
Bj was coming off of massive layoff.
And we knew it was a very uphill battle.

2166
01:58:36.901 --> 01:58:38.100
I was as shocked.

2167
01:58:38.330 --> 01:58:42.190
I mean I was really hurt when I heard the first and I saw

2168
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:45.880
<v 2>the things being said and kind of the finger being pointed my way cause I know</v>

2169
01:58:45.881 --> 01:58:50.881
what happened and I know what my influence or lack of influence was and I will

2170
01:58:51.310 --> 01:58:53.380
say I will go down with the fucking ship.

2171
01:58:53.381 --> 01:58:57.400
Any athlete that knows me that I work with knows the type of person I am and I

2172
01:58:57.401 --> 01:59:01.720
think I've built it,
built a solid reputation within the industry and it was,

2173
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:02.890
it was just uncalled for.

2174
01:59:02.891 --> 01:59:05.350
It was unfair and I kept my mouth shut because I try and be,

2175
01:59:05.351 --> 01:59:08.860
I want it to be a professional and I didn't want to say anything because bt has

2176
01:59:08.861 --> 01:59:10.690
got a lot of fans.
I'm a fucking huge fan of the kit.

2177
01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:13.480
I still am a huge fan of the kid and I understand because I have fought before,

2178
01:59:13.481 --> 01:59:17.050
I've lost before and I've been hurt before and I've wanted to blame and I still

2179
01:59:17.051 --> 01:59:21.850
couldn't blame.
But what does that going to get?
And with my,

2180
01:59:21.851 --> 01:59:23.380
you know,
defend myself here for a second.

2181
01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:28.800
I know what I did and I think I was probably one of the only bright positives

2182
01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:33.370
with true world class experience that was around him.

2183
01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:37.480
I didn't have to be a part of that campus cause he's isolated.

2184
01:59:37.481 --> 01:59:40.990
He's on Hilo on very difficult.
Ireland is very,

2185
01:59:40.991 --> 01:59:44.620
very difficult when you're the most famous fucking person and you've got people

2186
01:59:44.621 --> 01:59:47.950
showing up at your house,
knocking on your door to get an autograph.
Things.

2187
01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:51.850
It was,
it was,
it was difficult.
It was very hard situation.

2188
01:59:51.851 --> 01:59:55.500
It was his people knocking on his door.
Yeah.
Trying to get an autograph.
Yeah.

2189
01:59:55.900 --> 01:59:58.060
I mean I feel bad for the guy that's,
you know,

2190
01:59:58.210 --> 02:00:00.940
luckily there's not that many people.
After a couple hours you're done,

2191
02:00:00.941 --> 02:00:04.150
you're done.
But it was the old town anywhere he goes,

2192
02:00:04.151 --> 02:00:07.980
people are honking the Horn Santa,
he's a superstar specific.
I mean it here,

2193
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:11.220
he's a superstar there.
He's just,
you know,
he's like the king over there.
Right.

2194
02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:14.910
And it was,
it was hard for a lot of different reasons,
but you know,
for,

2195
02:00:15.550 --> 02:00:19.300
to see the things said and basically the way that they were men,
you know,

2196
02:00:19.301 --> 02:00:20.350
we look,
you look at the fight,

2197
02:00:20.351 --> 02:00:23.800
you look at what happened that had nothing to do with food and had nothing to do

2198
02:00:23.801 --> 02:00:24.940
with body weight.
There's,
you know,

2199
02:00:24.941 --> 02:00:28.600
we posted a video of him two days before Wayne's,
he woke up at one 48 fully fed,

2200
02:00:28.601 --> 02:00:31.120
fully hydrated,
saying it's the best.
He fucking fell and his entire life.

2201
02:00:32.110 --> 02:00:34.030
And then,
you know,

2202
02:00:34.140 --> 02:00:35.960
<v 1>I understand what you're saying.
Um,</v>

2203
02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:40.130
I found it incredibly fascinating that you said the athletes don't work out at

2204
02:00:40.131 --> 02:00:44.810
all the week of,
and one of the reasons why is because I happened to be at,

2205
02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:46.880
um,
Uriah Faber's,
uh,

2206
02:00:46.910 --> 02:00:51.910
Jim this past weekend when TJ fought and when Danny Castillo fought.

2207
02:00:53.420 --> 02:00:57.350
And when I got there,
Danny Castillo was working out.
Yeah.

2208
02:00:57.410 --> 02:01:01.940
The day of the fight he was hitting mitts with Dwayne.
Yeah.
And,
uh,
you know,

2209
02:01:01.941 --> 02:01:06.920
they put in like a good fucking 20 minute workout.
I mean,
he was hitting Mitts,

2210
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:11.660
man.
I mean,
he wasn't just,
he wasn't going like 10% speed,

2211
02:01:11.661 --> 02:01:15.950
like just moving his body around.
He was working out.
Yeah.
Footwork drills,

2212
02:01:16.150 --> 02:01:18.560
you know,
combination.
He looked great.
Yeah.
You know,

2213
02:01:18.561 --> 02:01:21.650
and I was kind of shocked and I asked why and he said,
well,

2214
02:01:21.651 --> 02:01:24.860
when he rehydrated he felt a little bloated,
but he always does that.

2215
02:01:24.861 --> 02:01:28.620
He always gets in a workout.
This was the Wayne's winning pretty rehydrated no,

2216
02:01:28.621 --> 02:01:32.180
this,
yeah,
after weigh ins rehydrated than the day of the fight.

2217
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:34.610
He worked out the day of the fight.

2218
02:01:34.670 --> 02:01:37.550
<v 2>And I do agree with something along those lines.</v>

2219
02:01:37.580 --> 02:01:40.130
They have to fight to get the fluids,
every athletes

2220
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:40.791
<v 3>a little bit different.</v>

2221
02:01:40.791 --> 02:01:44.000
We do with that with Nick Lance and he's the one who gave me the fucking black

2222
02:01:44.001 --> 02:01:48.050
eye on Friday before Charles canceled the fight.
We put them through usually,

2223
02:01:48.051 --> 02:01:48.560
you know,

2224
02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:53.120
abbreviated three rounds just to get a moving and make him feel good again.

2225
02:01:53.150 --> 02:01:56.540
Just we,
I approach and a lot of the athletes I work with,

2226
02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:00.830
we approach fight day like another fucking day.
Okay.
So hard sparring day.

2227
02:02:01.850 --> 02:02:03.110
So,
oh,
I see what you're saying.

2228
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:07.250
So you treat it like as if he's just going to do some hard sparring that day.

2229
02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:11.780
So when you have him work out to get the fluids moving as it were,

2230
02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:16.250
what,
what's the idea behind that?
Is that like the,
the rehydration process,

2231
02:02:16.251 --> 02:02:17.480
the ivy and everything like that?

2232
02:02:17.481 --> 02:02:20.690
You want everything moving through the body and make sure everything's working

2233
02:02:20.691 --> 02:02:24.260
properly so there's no surprises.
But we're not overworking the athlete.

2234
02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:27.500
We're warming them up and then we're just calling them right back down again,

2235
02:02:27.501 --> 02:02:29.690
making them big.
Part of it is also,

2236
02:02:29.691 --> 02:02:32.480
it's building confidence because they go through the weight cut process and

2237
02:02:32.481 --> 02:02:35.810
sometimes you feel a little shitty and you're like,
fuck,
do I still have it?

2238
02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:38.780
I felt like shit.
You know,
Shit.
Yesterday I felt like yesterday I got,

2239
02:02:38.781 --> 02:02:41.330
he looked so big yesterday and get in there and they feel,
you know,

2240
02:02:41.331 --> 02:02:46.220
obviously nick is,
weighs in at 46 and he was probably four to six closer to,

2241
02:02:46.221 --> 02:02:50.240
you know,
65 the very next morning and felt like a fucking machine.

2242
02:02:50.241 --> 02:02:53.060
And he left that room with a smile on his face.

2243
02:02:53.061 --> 02:02:54.530
Like I'm gonna fucking kill this dude.

2244
02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:59.060
What do you do when it comes to guys like heavyweights?
I W most heavyweights,

2245
02:02:59.061 --> 02:03:02.090
in my opinion,
I'm not saying that they should cut weight,

2246
02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:05.330
but they should all be fighting somewhere between 10 and 12% body fat.

2247
02:03:05.570 --> 02:03:08.300
The chubby heavy weights with the fat belly.
That's a lazy athlete.

2248
02:03:09.390 --> 02:03:13.730
Fatal fate or could have been better.
I believe he could have been,

2249
02:03:13.731 --> 02:03:17.030
God forbid he could have been better.
What about cane?
Cane looks a little fat.

2250
02:03:17.210 --> 02:03:20.970
I know,
but he's a monster.
Could be.
Look at Daniel Cormier.
Yeah.

2251
02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:22.520
These guys,

2252
02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:26.090
just because you compete in an unlimited weight class or nearly unlimited weight

2253
02:03:26.091 --> 02:03:28.400
class,
it doesn't mean you can have an unlimited bodyweight.

2254
02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:32.480
What's the proper body weight for performance?
For most athletes,

2255
02:03:32.481 --> 02:03:34.520
it's somewhere between eight to 12%.

2256
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:37.100
Is there a proper body weight for a heavyweight?

2257
02:03:37.101 --> 02:03:40.010
As far as like when you get too heavy,
you're dealing with gravity,

2258
02:03:40.011 --> 02:03:43.550
you're dealing with mass that needs to have blood pump through it because isn't

2259
02:03:43.551 --> 02:03:48.140
the one variable that's not very different in people the size of your actual

2260
02:03:48.141 --> 02:03:52.310
heart that the heart tends to be similar in size.

2261
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:56.610
Slight variables more similar in size.
So like a guy like big foot Silva.
Yup.

2262
02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:00.410
Or Brock Lesnar's is a better example because bigfoot actually has gigantism is

2263
02:04:00.411 --> 02:04:01.244
a real issue.

2264
02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:06.760
But Brock Lesnar an enormous giant and then a guy like say Kris Carr Yasso who's

2265
02:04:07.131 --> 02:04:08.540
fighting for the flyweight title.

2266
02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:12.830
Their heart has probably way more similar in size in any other part of their

2267
02:04:12.831 --> 02:04:15.380
body.
I would agree with that.
Maybe the cock,
I dunno about that.

2268
02:04:15.381 --> 02:04:17.620
I just throw that out there for some real,
Chris has bigger problem.

2269
02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:22.250
Maybe he's got a giant kids got balls tell you that,
but I'm pumped.

2270
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:27.710
Um,
tough guy,
Chris Carr.
Jasa interesting fight coming up.
But my point being,

2271
02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:32.900
is there a number where a heavyweight like shouldn't like some be a lot of

2272
02:04:32.901 --> 02:04:36.440
people think the most effective way to somewhere around two 44 heavyweight.

2273
02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:38.460
And I agree.

2274
02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:43.470
I think they think that because that's what Cain is what Kevin Kane eating

2275
02:04:43.471 --> 02:04:46.260
properly and he's the fucking dominant champion of the world.

2276
02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:48.090
So I'm not saying he should do anything,

2277
02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:53.070
but there's no reason why any professional athlete should be walking around with

2278
02:04:53.490 --> 02:04:55.230
excess,
nonfunctional weight.

2279
02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:59.130
And a lot of what's floating around canes midsection or athletes like Canaan.

2280
02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:00.870
He's one of the better conditioned.

2281
02:05:01.170 --> 02:05:05.070
But without that eight 10 1216 additional pounds,

2282
02:05:05.370 --> 02:05:07.170
how much faster would he be?

2283
02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:12.300
Force production would probably be very similar unless he really sits down on a

2284
02:05:12.301 --> 02:05:16.500
single punch or one single blast.
But he probably be faster.

2285
02:05:16.501 --> 02:05:20.160
He probably be more agile,
he'd be more capable of scrambling.

2286
02:05:20.161 --> 02:05:22.920
He'd be able to do a few more things with no loss in strength.

2287
02:05:23.130 --> 02:05:27.300
So you think if he got down about two 30 and load as body fat to about 10% he'd

2288
02:05:27.301 --> 02:05:30.120
be even better than the best heavy weight ever?
I believe so.
I mean,

2289
02:05:30.121 --> 02:05:31.740
I don't know if Cain is the best heavy weight ever,

2290
02:05:31.741 --> 02:05:35.790
but in my opinion it's between him and fade or there's two best heavyweights of

2291
02:05:35.791 --> 02:05:38.300
all time in my mind.
Yeah,
and their cane and fade or yeah,

2292
02:05:38.490 --> 02:05:42.270
look at Tyson at 20 pounds of fat to Tyson.
What happens to Mike Tyson?

2293
02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:45.330
He no longer becomes one of the most dominant heavyweights in the world.

2294
02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:48.150
Is that true though?
I mean,
I don't know about that man.

2295
02:05:48.151 --> 02:05:51.420
Like the Tyson that knocked out Larry Holmes,
you put on 10 pounds on him.

2296
02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:55.470
He's still gonna Fuck Larry Holmes up put 20 but is he still able to cover that

2297
02:05:55.471 --> 02:05:56.880
distance?
Is he still going to have that,

2298
02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.290
that fast twitch Movement for eight and 12 rounds.

2299
02:06:01.410 --> 02:06:05.190
First three rounds.
Everybody looks like a fucking monster,
you know in,

2300
02:06:05.191 --> 02:06:07.650
in boxing where first five minutes in MMA,
first round,

2301
02:06:08.070 --> 02:06:09.450
everybody can move really quick,

2302
02:06:09.690 --> 02:06:14.280
but then as time goes on that wait start gravity starts to pull on you but okay.

2303
02:06:14.281 --> 02:06:17.970
In,
in response to that,
the two guys that we were talking about,
both Cade,

2304
02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:22.620
both Kane and fader or both guys that had high body fat who are known for their

2305
02:06:22.621 --> 02:06:26.930
high output and they're long fights with incredible endurance and they could

2306
02:06:26.931 --> 02:06:29.910
have been better.
It's not really true though,
I believe.
So is it,

2307
02:06:29.911 --> 02:06:34.440
is it possible that carrying around a certain amount of fat aids,
your endurance,

2308
02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:38.940
is that possible?
Absolutely.
But what would that line be?
Just and me visually,

2309
02:06:38.941 --> 02:06:40.290
I'm not in their camps.
I don't know.

2310
02:06:40.291 --> 02:06:43.910
So we're just kinda throwing shit at the wall right now.
I say,

2311
02:06:43.911 --> 02:06:46.040
and all the athletes just experienced,

2312
02:06:46.041 --> 02:06:47.760
we're gonna throw some bro Science out there right now.

2313
02:06:48.210 --> 02:06:52.020
Eight to 12% body fat for the heavyweights,
closer to the 12% not down to 8%.

2314
02:06:52.410 --> 02:06:54.360
You know,
for the lighter guys,

2315
02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:58.710
8% or cell makes more sense when [inaudible] was at his prime.
Yeah.

2316
02:06:58.770 --> 02:07:02.880
What do you think his body fat was?
Um,
he held a lot of fat in his belly,

2317
02:07:02.881 --> 02:07:05.250
but there's some fights where you could see veins running through his shoulders

2318
02:07:05.251 --> 02:07:07.550
and arms.
You know,
he had rather skinny legs,

2319
02:07:07.551 --> 02:07:11.100
so he was kind of ass heavy and you know,
stomach oh bleak.
Heavy.

2320
02:07:11.101 --> 02:07:13.860
And that's where he was handling a lot of our carrying a lot of the,
wait,

2321
02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:18.990
what was it?
Probably you know,
14 the 16.
Did you ever talk to him?

2322
02:07:18.991 --> 02:07:19.081
You,

2323
02:07:19.081 --> 02:07:22.980
you're find out what his diet was or anything with love to I've slide a fucking

2324
02:07:22.981 --> 02:07:26.700
Russia to find out what's going on with that guy.
I think he was at his prick.

2325
02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:29.450
Well certainly there's skill involved.

2326
02:07:29.490 --> 02:07:32.730
I mean he had tremendous them a price on both skills.
Yeah,

2327
02:07:32.731 --> 02:07:36.070
I know what you're going to.
I mean without a doubt.
He had

2328
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:40.570
<v 1>incredible mental toughness and his ability to perform under pressure was</v>

2329
02:07:40.900 --> 02:07:43.780
fantastic.
There was a lot going on there.

2330
02:07:43.940 --> 02:07:48.280
But I would also like to know what his actual training protocol was when you got

2331
02:07:48.281 --> 02:07:49.810
to see those,
uh,

2332
02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:52.720
those highlights when he did strike force of him working out and stuff.

2333
02:07:52.721 --> 02:07:54.770
But you don't know what the fuck that is.
You know,

2334
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:56.410
a lot of times guys would just,
you know,

2335
02:07:56.411 --> 02:07:59.290
they'll tell you I hit the bag for our promo and you know,

2336
02:07:59.291 --> 02:08:01.600
he'd have him fucking throw casting punches at the bag.

2337
02:08:01.601 --> 02:08:03.610
You don't really know what,
what is he actually doing?

2338
02:08:03.940 --> 02:08:07.570
What's his actual training and most of that stuff on TV,
it's mostly fake.

2339
02:08:07.910 --> 02:08:10.720
Most of the athletes,
they don't run with the fucking parachutes.

2340
02:08:10.870 --> 02:08:12.100
They don't do a lot of that,

2341
02:08:13.090 --> 02:08:16.120
that type of training called sexy training and it looks awesome on TV,

2342
02:08:16.330 --> 02:08:18.970
but that's not really what they're doing on the daily and the higher level

2343
02:08:18.971 --> 02:08:23.920
athletes really trained very basics.
They focus on the basics.
Then you know,

2344
02:08:23.921 --> 02:08:26.590
they get really good at the fucking basics and they start adding some higher

2345
02:08:26.591 --> 02:08:29.260
level technique.
Same thing on the strength and conditioning side.

2346
02:08:29.350 --> 02:08:31.420
Matt Brown does a lot of really wild shit,
man.

2347
02:08:31.450 --> 02:08:34.300
He does a lot of really wild strength conditioning shit.
Do you work?

2348
02:08:34.330 --> 02:08:36.700
Do you work with him at all?
The Mortal Brown?
Yeah.
No I don't.

2349
02:08:36.701 --> 02:08:39.460
Unfortunate we've played with it and we were cast members on the ultimate

2350
02:08:39.461 --> 02:08:40.780
fighter years ago.
We're still buddies,

2351
02:08:41.050 --> 02:08:42.640
but I haven't worked with him specifically.

2352
02:08:42.641 --> 02:08:45.400
I'd love to down the road that I think that'd be a fun part of my career.
Yeah.

2353
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:48.730
He's a guy who,
I've seen some of his workouts,
they're fucking brutal.

2354
02:08:48.731 --> 02:08:52.210
He doesn't like a really unorthodox stuff.
A lot of crazy lifts,

2355
02:08:52.211 --> 02:08:55.930
dead lifts and all kinds of obviously a very thin guy,

2356
02:08:55.931 --> 02:08:59.470
but obviously very physically strong.
We've trained together,
you know,

2357
02:08:59.471 --> 02:09:04.180
even after the show Matt strong as hell.
He's a lot stronger than he looks.

2358
02:09:04.181 --> 02:09:06.550
He looks like that thin lean guy.
He's got,

2359
02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:09.710
he's fucking strong when he gets his hands on you and he's like granted.
Hmm.

2360
02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:15.070
Yeah.
I mean as we're talking about this and talking about different styles and

2361
02:09:15.071 --> 02:09:17.170
different people's training,
um,
it's,

2362
02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:20.470
it is interesting that there's no one answer.
Like,

2363
02:09:20.471 --> 02:09:24.100
this is what you have to do in order to,
you know,
do x.

2364
02:09:24.101 --> 02:09:28.030
You have to start out with,
you know,
why and put it in,
you know,

2365
02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:30.250
w and there's no answer,
right.

2366
02:09:30.251 --> 02:09:32.560
It's like everybody has to figure out what works well for them.

2367
02:09:32.860 --> 02:09:37.860
And when you see guys like re readjust and rebound and try to reassess their

2368
02:09:39.191 --> 02:09:42.130
career,
like,
like Overeem is a perfect example.

2369
02:09:42.370 --> 02:09:44.770
Overeem is now at Jackson's and he,
you know,

2370
02:09:44.771 --> 02:09:48.190
he just fought against Ben Rothwell and got knocked out in the first round look

2371
02:09:48.191 --> 02:09:52.360
great for a little bit until he got clipped.
Yeah.
But,
um,
you know,

2372
02:09:52.361 --> 02:09:54.580
he was doing things a lot differently.
Throwing those,

2373
02:09:54.581 --> 02:09:58.120
a oblique kicks to the knee,
which a lot of people don't like.

2374
02:09:58.150 --> 02:10:00.940
They're upset about that.
I don't like those either.
Yeah.

2375
02:10:01.210 --> 02:10:04.690
It's a weird technique because you're not supposed to attack the knee itself,

2376
02:10:04.691 --> 02:10:07.060
right?
Isn't that,
what's the story?
What the rule is?

2377
02:10:07.061 --> 02:10:09.520
I think it's like within an inch or two of the need,
depending on,

2378
02:10:09.521 --> 02:10:12.730
I forget the exact role now,
but,
but nobody calls you on it.
I have,

2379
02:10:12.731 --> 02:10:15.700
haven't seen him throwing a bleak kick and an inch over the knee.

2380
02:10:15.701 --> 02:10:17.680
No one's going to say,
Hey,
don't attack the knee.
Nope.

2381
02:10:17.890 --> 02:10:20.470
Especially when you're lying on your back and you throw one up kicks.

2382
02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:24.880
People throw them right at the knees and no one says a word.
Yeah.
You know,
like,

2383
02:10:24.881 --> 02:10:28.530
uh,
when Kunaki and Hicks and Gracie fought.
Yup.
You know,

2384
02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:32.170
remember that Hixon fucking blasting them right in the knees and fell off of his

2385
02:10:32.171 --> 02:10:34.280
back.
It's interesting

2386
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:35.090
<v 3>man.</v>

2387
02:10:35.090 --> 02:10:40.070
You look at like Eddie style of Jujitsu [inaudible] verse the Gracie style or

2388
02:10:40.071 --> 02:10:44.410
just the word Lat Bang Moitai verse.
You know,
Duke Roufus,
you know,

2389
02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:48.260
it's like different philosophies,
different approaches,

2390
02:10:48.261 --> 02:10:51.740
but they all fucking work really well.
And if you speak with Dwayne,

2391
02:10:51.741 --> 02:10:54.380
he's going to say,
no,
this is the system.
Right?

2392
02:10:54.381 --> 02:10:56.000
And you're gonna smell that he's got it.

2393
02:10:56.360 --> 02:11:00.230
And then you'll watch Pettis fight and you know,
Duke Roufus has got his own,

2394
02:11:00.231 --> 02:11:03.770
he's got his own and that shit fucking works.
It works real good.

2395
02:11:03.771 --> 02:11:06.590
Strength and conditioning I think is very similar and it's,

2396
02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:11.690
the athlete is really going to gravitate towards what suits them,

2397
02:11:11.691 --> 02:11:14.660
but it's all,
you know,
like I said,
the athlete changes,
which is why my,

2398
02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:17.510
we have the principles,
so the principles don't change y'all Duane,

2399
02:11:17.511 --> 02:11:20.660
let's say throw a punch with your right hand.
Left hand has to be blocking.

2400
02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:23.930
I think Duke would say the same thing,
but the individual application,

2401
02:11:24.050 --> 02:11:28.370
that's where it changes on the individual basis per athlete per time.

2402
02:11:28.371 --> 02:11:32.270
They compete or fon different athletes.
So the principles are always the same.

2403
02:11:32.570 --> 02:11:35.030
But we always have to evolve the application.
I'm sure.

2404
02:11:35.031 --> 02:11:37.550
Just like Eddie's doing every night he goes in the gym,
he's like,
Oh shit,

2405
02:11:37.970 --> 02:11:41.450
I saw this fucking white out do something that just totally killed the black

2406
02:11:41.451 --> 02:11:43.700
belts move.
What?
Let me fucking try that.

2407
02:11:43.730 --> 02:11:46.400
If there's variables introduced through that don't exist in striking.

2408
02:11:46.401 --> 02:11:49.150
But there's also striking variables that don't exist in Jujitsu.

2409
02:11:49.170 --> 02:11:54.170
Like the idea of throwing things at like a 50 or 60% outright output instead of

2410
02:11:55.011 --> 02:11:58.790
100% with each technique.
Yeah.
Whereas some guys like Jeremy Stevens,

2411
02:11:58.791 --> 02:12:01.610
perfect example,
Jeremy Stevens is a fucking murderer.
He throws,

2412
02:12:01.611 --> 02:12:04.400
everything is designed to knock your face into the dirt.

2413
02:12:04.430 --> 02:12:08.510
I mean everything he throws is 100% on it and he's just works hard to be able to

2414
02:12:08.511 --> 02:12:08.960
do that.

2415
02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:13.040
But its volume is much lower than say a guy like Nick Diaz who Nick Diaz will

2416
02:12:13.041 --> 02:12:18.041
come at you and he'll throw like many punches at like 50 60% and put it on you

2417
02:12:18.291 --> 02:12:20.760
and then throw some hundreds in there,
you know,

2418
02:12:20.970 --> 02:12:25.070
dig to the body with a hundred go upstairs with a hundred and then more 50 50 50

2419
02:12:25.071 --> 02:12:29.330
50 and he just puts volume on you.
So you don't see that.
And Jujitsu,

2420
02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:33.850
you very rarely see guys like hit moves at less than 100% you know,
when you're,

2421
02:12:33.870 --> 02:12:35.600
when you're trying to get a teen,
someone,

2422
02:12:35.601 --> 02:12:38.990
you don't try to get a team them at 50% you know?
Sure.
You locked that bitch up,

2423
02:12:38.991 --> 02:12:42.650
you're squeezing with everything you got.
Yup.
So it's a,
it's a fascinating thing,

2424
02:12:42.850 --> 02:12:47.600
the,
the different approaches for different body styles because some guys also,

2425
02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:51.860
they don't have like Dominick Cruz,
great fighter,
great athlete,
great champion,

2426
02:12:52.010 --> 02:12:56.330
does not have that sort of one punched Jeremy Stevens power.

2427
02:12:56.330 --> 02:12:59.180
He just doesn't possess it.
He doesn't have the body for it.
You know,

2428
02:12:59.190 --> 02:13:02.450
just this is what the universe has given them.
They've given him a,
you know,

2429
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:05.750
he's a high volume,
high output,
high discipline,

2430
02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:10.290
excellent condition that's important imperative for him to be able to put on the

2431
02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:12.040
kind of performances that he puts on.
Yup.

2432
02:13:12.410 --> 02:13:15.800
Whereas some guys just go out there and try to Paul Daley yet,
you know,

2433
02:13:15.860 --> 02:13:20.090
excellent technique,
but everything's designed to murder you.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2434
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:24.500
It's an interesting growth and evolution of the sport and it's really cool to

2435
02:13:24.501 --> 02:13:26.150
see the different athletes,
different body types,

2436
02:13:26.151 --> 02:13:29.030
and see this new generation now coming out there.

2437
02:13:29.031 --> 02:13:31.740
Because what we're seeing guys like Cruz and Dillashaw,

2438
02:13:32.250 --> 02:13:35.310
<v 1>he's the champ now,
but he's part of a younger generation,</v>

2439
02:13:35.311 --> 02:13:38.700
but there's another tier below him now that's going to be coming soon in and

2440
02:13:38.701 --> 02:13:42.060
make Dillashaw look a little,
you know,
not one dimensional,

2441
02:13:42.990 --> 02:13:45.540
but a little slower,
let's say,
you know,
two,
three years from now,

2442
02:13:45.541 --> 02:13:48.540
there's some fucking kid in the middle of nowhere that's going to come out and I

2443
02:13:48.541 --> 02:13:50.730
can't imagine that.
But I know you're right.
It's gonna Happen,
right?

2444
02:13:51.070 --> 02:13:54.930
GSP came out and we're all like,
God damn,
this dude is like an Olympic gymnast.

2445
02:13:54.931 --> 02:13:57.270
And look at what he's doing.
And then you know,

2446
02:13:57.271 --> 02:14:00.540
you have a guy like Dillashaw coming out,
moving the way he does,

2447
02:14:00.541 --> 02:14:02.760
putting his wrestling together,
all the faints that he's dealing,

2448
02:14:02.761 --> 02:14:05.910
hitting with power.
You know,
kind of like what you were saying about Das,

2449
02:14:06.090 --> 02:14:08.760
where they're able to off speed their punches in the air strikes and really

2450
02:14:08.761 --> 02:14:11.130
change angles.
That's awesome.

2451
02:14:11.131 --> 02:14:15.230
South and he's seen the level of the wrestlers and athletes are just coming in.

2452
02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:18.060
They're just off the chain to like guys like Hendrix.

2453
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:22.200
You know guys like core me a,
just like when Carme fought Henderson,
you're like,

2454
02:14:22.201 --> 02:14:25.660
what the fuck?
Who the hell is ever done that to Dan Henderson?
Yeah,

2455
02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:27.540
call me and he's got him flying through the air.

2456
02:14:27.541 --> 02:14:29.490
He's hitting him with trips as he's moving back.

2457
02:14:29.491 --> 02:14:31.860
He's doing like a lot of crazy shit that you very rarely see.

2458
02:14:31.890 --> 02:14:36.890
That's when I think I realized how high level core me really is.

2459
02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:39.960
Oh yeah.
No one's like you said,
no one's ever done that to Dan.

2460
02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:41.400
Dan's lost a couple of fights,

2461
02:14:41.550 --> 02:14:44.160
but no one's ever been able to do that to Dan fucking Anderson before.

2462
02:14:44.190 --> 02:14:48.300
That's also interestingly enough,
Dan,
off testosterone replacement terms,

2463
02:14:48.301 --> 02:14:51.990
one of the first guys that we've seen compete on and now off,

2464
02:14:52.530 --> 02:14:55.990
and he had competed off before against Rashad Evans.
Yeah.

2465
02:14:56.100 --> 02:15:00.250
Lost a decision against Rashad Evans,
a very close fight.
Right.
Um,

2466
02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:03.120
and that was a,
because they were fighting in Winnipeg and Winnipeg,

2467
02:15:03.121 --> 02:15:06.450
so athletic commission didn't.
That's right.
But I,
I,
you know,
I believe Dan,

2468
02:15:06.451 --> 02:15:09.480
when he says that he takes a very little,
you know,
I believed them.

2469
02:15:09.630 --> 02:15:13.500
I believed the anthill.
Yeah.
I mean who is on it?
But a lot of these guys also,

2470
02:15:13.530 --> 02:15:18.300
one of the reasons why they test low is because they're overtraining.
Absolutely.

2471
02:15:18.450 --> 02:15:21.720
And that's something that people need to take into consideration when they

2472
02:15:21.721 --> 02:15:26.610
discuss training protocols is that what's happening with a lot of fighters is

2473
02:15:26.850 --> 02:15:30.300
they're going through the same sort of thing that they went through in wrestling

2474
02:15:30.301 --> 02:15:32.480
practice and what wrestling practices,

2475
02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:35.610
fantastic four is developing mental toughness.

2476
02:15:35.611 --> 02:15:39.810
I believe there are no tougher athletes in the world than someone goes through

2477
02:15:39.811 --> 02:15:43.680
high level wrestling camps.
Someone who goes to Purdue,
like a John Fitch.

2478
02:15:43.940 --> 02:15:47.430
You know when you,
you go through these fucking camps,
you go through Iowa,

2479
02:15:47.610 --> 02:15:49.890
you know,
you go through these,
these high level wrestling camps,

2480
02:15:49.891 --> 02:15:51.600
amateur wrestling,
college wrestling camps,

2481
02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:54.910
those people are fucking and a mall.

2482
02:15:55.260 --> 02:15:58.440
They have a level of mental toughness that if you don't understand it,

2483
02:15:58.650 --> 02:16:02.160
they're going to wake up 15 minutes earlier than anybody else because they know

2484
02:16:02.161 --> 02:16:03.330
that no one else is awake.

2485
02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:07.140
They're going to run an extra mile because they know no one else is gonna run
it.

2486
02:16:07.170 --> 02:16:07.830
They're going to,

2487
02:16:07.830 --> 02:16:10.740
they're going to do all these different things because they pride themselves in

2488
02:16:10.741 --> 02:16:14.910
being uncomfortable and grinding it out,
and there's good in that,

2489
02:16:15.090 --> 02:16:17.760
but there's also bad in it and the bad in it is the,

2490
02:16:17.850 --> 02:16:22.830
the physiological reality of the body's ability to recuperate and that if you

2491
02:16:22.831 --> 02:16:26.790
tested any of these high level professional wrestlers or a amateur wrestlers

2492
02:16:26.791 --> 02:16:29.530
rather at at their highest level when they're going camps,

2493
02:16:29.531 --> 02:16:32.860
I guarantee you a lot of them are going to have low testosterone.
Absolutely.

2494
02:16:32.861 --> 02:16:33.560
I would agree.

2495
02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:37.480
I think it's just because their body's being broken down and it's just the
sheer,

2496
02:16:37.481 --> 02:16:41.920
dogged determination of their own mind that allows them to get up every morning

2497
02:16:41.921 --> 02:16:42.670
and keep doing it.

2498
02:16:42.670 --> 02:16:47.080
<v 2>Yeah.
Look at Hendrix.
He,
when he fought Robbie fractured shin,</v>

2499
02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:51.250
torn biceps,
he had a fractured Shin to fractured chin.

2500
02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:55.900
And during the fighter from the fight,
from training in training,

2501
02:16:56.290 --> 02:16:58.930
he was fractured chin torn buys,

2502
02:16:58.931 --> 02:17:02.230
partially torn by us that would tour all the way during the fight.
And uh,

2503
02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:06.640
didn't even blink,
didn't complain one time.

2504
02:17:06.641 --> 02:17:09.480
The only way I found out was just kind of like in passing,

2505
02:17:09.490 --> 02:17:12.220
he was just joking about it.
You know,
any other athlete.

2506
02:17:12.221 --> 02:17:15.160
Most of the other athletes,
they're canceling that fight.

2507
02:17:15.161 --> 02:17:18.220
They're pushing it back three months,
six months,
you know,
and then that's,

2508
02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:22.660
and then Johnny goes out there and is able to get a win because of that mental

2509
02:17:22.661 --> 02:17:23.261
toughness.

2510
02:17:23.261 --> 02:17:26.650
And that's one of the things that makes Johnny so fucking great is that

2511
02:17:26.651 --> 02:17:31.600
physically,
I mean,
he's a really strong dude,
but he's not tall.
He's not long.

2512
02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:35.200
If he's got fast hands,
you know,
he is fast,
but his feet aren't very fast.

2513
02:17:35.201 --> 02:17:39.610
He doesn't cut angles or move his head movement to,
well it's his,
his main,

2514
02:17:39.611 --> 02:17:41.050
it's his brain.
It's his mentality.

2515
02:17:41.051 --> 02:17:44.740
He's got that championship mindset that's just been ground into him through a

2516
02:17:44.741 --> 02:17:48.310
whole lifetime of wrestling.
Well he taught also his dad's a fucking psycho.

2517
02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:52.300
Fucking awesome.
You know,
it's funny.
Is it low?

2518
02:17:52.301 --> 02:17:56.710
He had two options or three options.
Wrestling,
wrestling or wrestling.

2519
02:17:58.830 --> 02:17:59.690
That's all good.

2520
02:17:59.690 --> 02:18:03.710
<v 1>Wrestle or you could wrestle or you could wrestle and uh,
you know,</v>

2521
02:18:03.711 --> 02:18:07.310
like how he made him do pushups and sit ups and Chin ups and shit.

2522
02:18:07.311 --> 02:18:09.920
When he was a little boy,
he was doing fucking 500 pushups.

2523
02:18:09.921 --> 02:18:14.921
I mean he just had that kid as a youngster with a very high tolerance to work

2524
02:18:15.890 --> 02:18:20.780
and just this,
this drive,
he pushed him so that everything else will be easy.

2525
02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:24.050
I mean,
he made it so everything at home,
all the training he did,

2526
02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:26.810
all the wrestling practices were so fucking hard that everything else would be

2527
02:18:26.811 --> 02:18:28.170
easy.
Yeah.
And look at him.

2528
02:18:28.570 --> 02:18:33.050
UFC fucking middle welterweight champion and should have been the first time he

2529
02:18:33.051 --> 02:18:35.560
fought GSP.
Agreed.
In my opinion.
I mean the,

2530
02:18:35.660 --> 02:18:37.910
he got the title with the Robbie Lawler fight,
but I thought,

2531
02:18:38.450 --> 02:18:42.530
I thought it'd beat GSP and the only people that disagree that I've talked to or

2532
02:18:42.531 --> 02:18:46.370
people that were like in that Henzel Gracie camp that were a little bit biased

2533
02:18:46.371 --> 02:18:49.790
and thought that George one like round one,
which I didn't understand.

2534
02:18:50.090 --> 02:18:52.790
I think damage is more important than anything.

2535
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:56.060
And I think Johnny without a doubt did more damage in that fight.

2536
02:18:56.290 --> 02:18:59.240
Like they pointed to the Guillotine attempt in the first round,

2537
02:18:59.241 --> 02:19:02.720
but I didn't think that was a successful attempt.
I thought that was,
you know,

2538
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:06.710
I thought it was never close.
It's like,
did you see um,
uh,

2539
02:19:06.711 --> 02:19:09.360
Scoggins versus John Moraga this last fight?
Yeah,

2540
02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:13.400
the first gay team was very close to second gear teen locked it up.

2541
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:16.490
George never had a gay teen like that.
You know what I'm saying?

2542
02:19:16.491 --> 02:19:20.810
It wasn't like one of those where it was like Scoggins barely got out of that

2543
02:19:20.811 --> 02:19:22.970
first gate team or Morocco locked it up.
Yup.

2544
02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:26.030
But he was in deep shit and then he caught him with a second one.

2545
02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:30.170
That's not what the kind gay teen that Hendrix was caught in in that first
round.

2546
02:19:30.171 --> 02:19:32.960
So I didn't understand anybody saying that they thought that GSP one

2547
02:19:33.310 --> 02:19:36.070
<v 2>a little bias I think you know.
Sure.
But I'm biased words,</v>

2548
02:19:36.071 --> 02:19:39.250
Hendricks and I'll admit that.
But watching and trying to be impartial,

2549
02:19:39.760 --> 02:19:43.150
I think Hendrick's clearly one and I believe George and some of his team,

2550
02:19:43.151 --> 02:19:46.720
I think they know cause the two athletes when they walk out,
you know,

2551
02:19:46.721 --> 02:19:50.890
if you kind of won or lost and I think that one and it felt their mood,

2552
02:19:50.891 --> 02:19:54.610
their energy and just the way that they,
you know,
we interacted afterwards,

2553
02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:56.110
very professional,
respectful.

2554
02:19:56.350 --> 02:19:59.560
But I think they knew that Johnny had won that fight.
Truly.

2555
02:20:00.070 --> 02:20:01.440
How do you tell

2556
02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:04.630
<v 1>a fighter to stop?
Is there,</v>

2557
02:20:04.631 --> 02:20:07.390
is there a time where a fighter should be told to stop?

2558
02:20:07.391 --> 02:20:11.260
Cause if George was my friend,
I would tell Georgia stop.
Yeah.

2559
02:20:11.350 --> 02:20:14.110
And the reason why I would tell Georgia stop is because we did some sort of a

2560
02:20:14.111 --> 02:20:17.290
fight metric thing where we calculated all the times he's been hit inside the

2561
02:20:17.291 --> 02:20:22.120
octagon and he had been hitting the head 880 [inaudible] times over the course

2562
02:20:22.121 --> 02:20:25.120
of his UFC career.
And I'm like,
what is,

2563
02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:29.440
what's the number where a guy can walk?
Cause he talked to George,
now he's lucid,

2564
02:20:29.470 --> 02:20:33.070
you know,
he speaks well,
but I know that he was having migraines.

2565
02:20:33.071 --> 02:20:37.510
I know that he was having memory issues.
Yeah.
And um,

2566
02:20:38.490 --> 02:20:43.480
and I think there's only a certain amount of times a guy can fight.

2567
02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:46.690
There's only a certain amount of blows that guy can take.
And George,

2568
02:20:46.691 --> 02:20:50.230
if he stopped now,
could he have another fight?
Yeah,
yeah,
he definitely could.

2569
02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:53.080
Could he come back and be great but very possible.

2570
02:20:53.500 --> 02:20:56.800
But could he come back and take some damage that five years from now we're going

2571
02:20:56.801 --> 02:21:00.970
to see a much compromised George?
And that's possible as well,
right?

2572
02:21:01.050 --> 02:21:04.710
<v 2>Probably not.
I've had this conversation with athletes before and it's,</v>

2573
02:21:05.100 --> 02:21:09.450
it's difficult and it's emotional and it's,
you know,

2574
02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:11.790
it's in their best interest and sometimes you know,

2575
02:21:11.791 --> 02:21:16.791
they've gotten mad but they know it's out of love and care and concern and it's,

2576
02:21:18.420 --> 02:21:20.790
there's a risk to reward.
And you know,
anytime an athlete,

2577
02:21:20.791 --> 02:21:23.190
whether you're an amateur,
you're making millions of dollars,
there's a risk.

2578
02:21:23.191 --> 02:21:26.370
And what is the reward?
Is it some sort of personal challenge?
You try to,

2579
02:21:26.371 --> 02:21:26.590
you know,

2580
02:21:26.590 --> 02:21:30.780
scare away a demon or are you trying to provide a college education for your

2581
02:21:30.781 --> 02:21:31.560
daughter?

2582
02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:34.680
These are things that they get put on the scale and then become intellectual

2583
02:21:34.681 --> 02:21:37.800
conversations to have.
And you then you say,
all right,
is this worth the risk?

2584
02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:43.090
But a guy like GSP,
I mean,
he's proven everything.
He's a legend.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2585
02:21:43.300 --> 02:21:46.990
<v 1>Without a doubt.
He really has proven everything he can prove.
I mean,</v>

2586
02:21:47.020 --> 02:21:49.060
he can come back and beat other fighters,

2587
02:21:49.061 --> 02:21:52.030
but is he ever going to elevate the status of his legend?

2588
02:21:52.031 --> 02:21:55.420
He's one of the greatest of all time,
if not the greatest welterweight of all.

2589
02:21:55.421 --> 02:21:56.620
It's him and Matt Hughes.
Yeah,

2590
02:21:56.650 --> 02:21:58.860
those are the two greatest welterweight of all time.
Yeah.

2591
02:21:59.110 --> 02:22:03.550
And you know Matt is from a slightly different era.
There are areas overlap,

2592
02:22:03.580 --> 02:22:07.860
but you know,
in my opinion,
Matt,
it was a game changer,
you know,

2593
02:22:07.870 --> 02:22:10.150
so I think he still goes down as possibly,
you know,

2594
02:22:10.151 --> 02:22:13.090
it's in the debate for who's the greatest.
Sure.
But George,

2595
02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:15.940
he's not going to ever elevate where he's at.

2596
02:22:15.970 --> 02:22:19.150
Where he's at is a fucking all time legend.
Yeah.

2597
02:22:19.570 --> 02:22:22.430
You don't use more of an off time.
Legend.
I have one more fight.

2598
02:22:22.431 --> 02:22:25.260
It'll be another all time.
Legend.
No,
he said an all time legends there go.

2599
02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:28.020
I mean and as far as I know,
he's very wealthy.

2600
02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:30.390
I know he had to give a lot of money up to his fucking farm.
Right.

2601
02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:34.400
<v 2>Manager though.
And this is a lot of gross that's involved in that man.
Yeah.</v>

2602
02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:38.950
I had spoken about managers recently and it kind of got spun the wrong way.

2603
02:22:38.951 --> 02:22:41.650
I don't know if you heard anything.
I'm no talking to Ariel.

2604
02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:44.410
I said quote.

2605
02:22:44.411 --> 02:22:48.880
So I hope nobody out there is going to quote this out of context was athletes

2606
02:22:48.881 --> 02:22:52.780
need to get rid of their need to fire their managers and hire attorneys.

2607
02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:55.810
And it wasn't meant to be that every athlete needs to get rid of the manager.

2608
02:22:55.811 --> 02:22:59.440
Cause I said there's some great managers out there but there's some managers out

2609
02:22:59.441 --> 02:23:03.280
there that they have their hand too deep inside the athletes pocket where the

2610
02:23:03.281 --> 02:23:08.281
athlete can't excel and can't develop themselves as a professional because

2611
02:23:08.321 --> 02:23:12.070
they're spending 20 and 30% of their purse and all their earnings going straight

2612
02:23:12.071 --> 02:23:12.904
to their manager.

2613
02:23:13.210 --> 02:23:15.700
And then the athlete has to pay for an attorney to come in and do contract

2614
02:23:15.701 --> 02:23:17.980
review.
Then they have to pay for an agent to come in and bring in sponsorship.

2615
02:23:18.220 --> 02:23:22.750
Then they have to pay a striking Jujitsu wrestling strength coach.

2616
02:23:22.780 --> 02:23:25.690
Then they have to pay their income taxes.
Then they have to,
you know,

2617
02:23:25.750 --> 02:23:28.300
put food on the table for their family.
And you know,

2618
02:23:28.301 --> 02:23:31.810
at the UFC level where these contracts are much more strict.

2619
02:23:31.811 --> 02:23:32.980
And that's really what I was talking about.

2620
02:23:32.981 --> 02:23:37.030
It was during the Kelvin Jaslin I'm comments.
Was it the UFC level?

2621
02:23:37.060 --> 02:23:39.790
There's not a lot of negotiation room for most there's,

2622
02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:42.640
it's more of contract review.
Legalees and you know,

2623
02:23:42.641 --> 02:23:44.560
some of the managers came out and they said,
yeah,
you know,

2624
02:23:44.561 --> 02:23:47.860
they were pissed at me and I asked them all,
all of them specifically.
I said,

2625
02:23:47.861 --> 02:23:51.030
how many of your clients have come to you because their manager fucking sucked.

2626
02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:53.920
And they're like,
oh shit,
a bunch.
That's what I'm talking about.

2627
02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:56.770
But maybe you're awesome.
But at the same time,
these athletes,

2628
02:23:56.771 --> 02:23:59.620
they need attorneys to really look at the paperwork and yeah,

2629
02:23:59.621 --> 02:24:02.220
there's a building phase and you getting them in from air,

2630
02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:05.560
you're getting them notoriety and such to get to the UFC level.

2631
02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:09.580
But because you get them there doesn't mean that you should stay there.

2632
02:24:09.581 --> 02:24:13.030
And a guy like Mike Pyle,
he fired his manager a few fights back.

2633
02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:15.790
He talks directly with Joe.
Sylvie does all the negotiation.

2634
02:24:15.940 --> 02:24:18.670
He gets to keep all of his money.
He makes more money now.

2635
02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:22.630
And he hires an attorney to come in and do the contract review and such on a per

2636
02:24:22.631 --> 02:24:25.960
hour basis or a per contract basis.
And he speaks very openly about this.

2637
02:24:26.290 --> 02:24:29.260
He's one of the guys who was in the UFC and he's one of the higher paid athletes

2638
02:24:29.830 --> 02:24:30.663
out there doing it.

2639
02:24:30.750 --> 02:24:34.570
<v 1>Well,
you know,
obviously I love the UFC obviously.
Um,</v>

2640
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:37.050
it's a huge,

2641
02:24:38.430 --> 02:24:41.540
it's a huge honor for me to,

2642
02:24:41.570 --> 02:24:44.640
to call the fights and to be a part of the organization.

2643
02:24:44.641 --> 02:24:49.641
But I think the only way that the UFC is ever going to satisfy the athletes,

2644
02:24:52.980 --> 02:24:56.790
I mean the only way the athletes are ever going to be in a situation where

2645
02:24:56.791 --> 02:24:57.541
they're completely,

2646
02:24:57.541 --> 02:25:01.310
totally happy with what they get paid is if they're at the top of the heap.
Yeah.

2647
02:25:01.590 --> 02:25:04.420
I mean,
when people compare it to Floyd Mayweather,
Floyd Mayweather,

2648
02:25:04.421 --> 02:25:05.254
I made extra money.

2649
02:25:05.310 --> 02:25:09.900
Do you have any fucking people or Floyd Mayweather won it's Floyd Mayweather

2650
02:25:09.901 --> 02:25:11.520
period.
And everybody else who fights him,

2651
02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:15.420
they take a drastically reduced purse and they're super lucky that they get
that.

2652
02:25:15.630 --> 02:25:17.520
Like whatever my Donna got for that first fight,

2653
02:25:17.521 --> 02:25:20.070
1 million bucks or something like that.
Biggest pay days.
Correct.
Yeah.

2654
02:25:20.100 --> 02:25:20.701
And by the way,

2655
02:25:20.701 --> 02:25:24.610
that's not what GSP get provides GSP a lot more money money than that.

2656
02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:30.240
And GSP as big as he was is never the draw that Floyd Mayweather is.

2657
02:25:30.251 --> 02:25:35.080
Floyd Mayweather is a draw like internationally,
nationally.
He's gigantic.

2658
02:25:35.081 --> 02:25:38.050
I mean the,
the amount of [inaudible] he's also the promoter.

2659
02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:43.080
I mean he's got a lot of shit going on in less a fighter becomes a part of a

2660
02:25:43.451 --> 02:25:47.830
promotion.
I mean it's just not the same thing.
You know,
if the,

2661
02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:51.870
if the UFC like when Oscar de la Hoya was golden boy productions and you know,

2662
02:25:51.871 --> 02:25:55.690
when he was fighting as well and make an insane amounts of money in that.
Sure.

2663
02:25:55.930 --> 02:25:56.411
There's,
again,

2664
02:25:56.411 --> 02:26:01.411
it's only one Oscar de la Hoya and there's also the UFC like it or not.

2665
02:26:01.730 --> 02:26:02.563
And I love it.

2666
02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:07.620
They're essentially the number one game in town and it's not like there's a

2667
02:26:07.781 --> 02:26:12.490
close number two.
Whereas Bob Arum golden boy,

2668
02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:15.850
you know,
there's,
there's all these different promotions.
The money team,

2669
02:26:15.970 --> 02:26:19.990
there's a lot of different promotions when it comes to promoting fights.

2670
02:26:20.650 --> 02:26:24.760
Whereas the UFC is like,
there's Bella tour,
you know Bella Tours.

2671
02:26:24.761 --> 02:26:28.180
Not bad there on Spike TV.
They're doing real good.
You know,

2672
02:26:28.181 --> 02:26:31.180
I'm a big fan of Scott Coker.
I'm a big fan of spike TV,

2673
02:26:31.450 --> 02:26:33.370
but the reality is there's a God damn huge.

2674
02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:36.700
Who the fuck is the UFC heavyweight champion?
Cain Velasquez?

2675
02:26:36.910 --> 02:26:40.300
Who's The Bellator heavyweight champion?
I don't even know who he is.

2676
02:26:40.630 --> 02:26:44.560
I don't know who it is.
I know.
Was it used to be Coal Conrad?
Was He?
Nope.

2677
02:26:44.561 --> 02:26:47.230
Maybe not even.
Wasn't his,
but he retired retired money.

2678
02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:50.500
Ben Asker and used to be the welterweight champion and that who's the

2679
02:26:50.501 --> 02:26:54.850
welterweight champion now?
Is it Lima is a Douglas.
Amen.

2680
02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:58.900
God,
I couldn't tell you man.
He's world class kicks,
right?
Was he the one?

2681
02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:01.510
Maybe he did.
I mean,
I know he wins a lot.

2682
02:27:01.511 --> 02:27:04.480
He's world class without a de Lima could compete with,
in my opinion,

2683
02:27:04.481 --> 02:27:08.230
everyone else in the world.
But Ben asked her and kind of ragdolled him,
you know,

2684
02:27:08.231 --> 02:27:12.310
and Ben ask her now is fighting for one FC.
So it's like the difference.
Okay,

2685
02:27:12.311 --> 02:27:14.800
there's Schlemenko,
he's the middleweight champion shore.

2686
02:27:14.890 --> 02:27:17.980
But someone from his fucking camp talk to him in a fight.

2687
02:27:17.981 --> 02:27:21.830
And Tito Ortiz hope he got paid for that was like,
Eh,

2688
02:27:21.890 --> 02:27:26.560
I mean it's like a grown man fighting a guy who is in high school.

2689
02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:27.670
That's what it looked like.
I mean,

2690
02:27:27.671 --> 02:27:32.671
Tito was fucking enormous and that Blanco's probably truly a wealth or wealth at

2691
02:27:32.861 --> 02:27:36.610
the UFC,
right?
Yeah.
In my opinion.
Yeah.
And somehow or another he's fighting Tito.

2692
02:27:36.611 --> 02:27:39.970
When Tito got on top of them,
like this dude is not getting off the bottom.

2693
02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:43.240
Tito is very underrated submission skills as well.
He's good.
Yeah.

2694
02:27:43.241 --> 02:27:47.680
He can't knock them.
Huge disparity.
Yeah.
Just giant.
And then,

2695
02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:49.240
I mean that's your middle weight champion.

2696
02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:51.250
You just saw your middle weight champion,
get choked to sleep.

2697
02:27:51.370 --> 02:27:53.950
Not good for any by a guy who could fight it.
Heavyweight.
Yeah.

2698
02:27:53.951 --> 02:27:55.930
Like what the fuck are you guys doing?

2699
02:27:56.500 --> 02:27:58.570
And they did that just to sell a paper view.

2700
02:27:58.630 --> 02:28:01.990
And the whole thing was just preposterous.
And I think that,
uh,

2701
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:07.330
you know,
unless that changes,
there's the,
the,
the,

2702
02:28:07.630 --> 02:28:11.760
the amount of money fighters get,
like there's,
it's not going to be the,

2703
02:28:11.780 --> 02:28:16.690
the level that you're going to get inboxing until boxing and the UFC.
I mean,

2704
02:28:16.900 --> 02:28:21.130
until there's a,
I mean maybe it'll be one of the new champions,

2705
02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:22.340
it'd be Ronda Rousey

2706
02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:26.780
<v 2>that gets your first or her first $50 million cause she kinda has that</v>

2707
02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:30.890
transcendent appeal.
Sure.
I mean she really is sort of transcending this sport.

2708
02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:33.590
She's the biggest star right now in an MMA.
Sure.

2709
02:28:33.650 --> 02:28:38.650
And it's because of what she does outside of the octagon as much as she does

2710
02:28:39.050 --> 02:28:40.250
what she does inside.

2711
02:28:40.251 --> 02:28:43.490
And that's something I try and talk to athletes about the athletes that I

2712
02:28:43.491 --> 02:28:46.760
haven't had the ability to influence.
And that's what I see other athletes do.

2713
02:28:46.761 --> 02:28:47.840
A guy like Alan Belcher,

2714
02:28:48.140 --> 02:28:53.140
Alan Belcher makes far more money running his gyms and online training business

2715
02:28:53.450 --> 02:28:56.990
than he does when competing as a professional athlete inside the UFC.

2716
02:28:56.991 --> 02:29:00.530
And he makes a good payday inside the UFC and the athletes,

2717
02:29:00.531 --> 02:29:05.420
they need to understand that they're as big or as good as they want to be and

2718
02:29:05.421 --> 02:29:09.320
they can certainly build their brand in areas like yourself.

2719
02:29:09.350 --> 02:29:14.350
You find areas that you enjoy and that you're good at and we're,

2720
02:29:14.511 --> 02:29:16.520
you're not good at yet but you want to be good at.

2721
02:29:16.521 --> 02:29:19.490
So you bust your ass to push your way into that field.
In that niche.

2722
02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:21.950
And athletes,
they have more than enough time to do that.

2723
02:29:22.070 --> 02:29:25.610
Whether it's flipping real estate like Bristol Morandi's doin right now and he's

2724
02:29:25.611 --> 02:29:29.300
making his Bristol Bristol Monday was a float and UFC a couple times fault for

2725
02:29:29.301 --> 02:29:32.930
strike force.
He was on the ultimate fighter a couple of seasons back.
Um,

2726
02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:35.780
he's flipping real estate in Las Vegas and the article came out about him

2727
02:29:35.781 --> 02:29:38.100
recently.
He makes shitload more money doing that.

2728
02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:41.060
Then he does fighting and he's fighting because he enjoys fighting.

2729
02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:43.980
You know Alan Belcher,
what he's doing,
what Ron does,
dealing may,

2730
02:29:43.981 --> 02:29:45.650
Ron does outside the octagon.

2731
02:29:45.651 --> 02:29:48.170
Money is going to eclipse what she makes inside the octagon.

2732
02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:49.820
She's such an anomaly though.
I mean,

2733
02:29:49.821 --> 02:29:52.130
how many hot chicks can beat the fuck out of dude.
I know,

2734
02:29:52.160 --> 02:29:54.260
but she's going with what she has.

2735
02:29:54.261 --> 02:29:57.860
And there's a lot of athletes out there that can go with what they have.

2736
02:29:57.861 --> 02:29:59.390
They all have some look at what Ludwig did.

2737
02:29:59.630 --> 02:30:02.570
He went from being a high level fighter at the end of his career.

2738
02:30:02.571 --> 02:30:06.380
He transitioned to a coach and he'll be a much more successful financially.

2739
02:30:06.430 --> 02:30:07.010
And you know,

2740
02:30:07.010 --> 02:30:11.420
business wise as a coach grown is affiliate system building his brand that way.

2741
02:30:11.870 --> 02:30:13.220
And he made good money as a fighter,

2742
02:30:13.221 --> 02:30:17.280
as a top tier fight or knocked out Jens Pulver one the k one Max North
Americans.

2743
02:30:17.300 --> 02:30:20.560
I mean he did some really good things inside the sport.
So just taking that,

2744
02:30:20.620 --> 02:30:24.380
that concept.
So if,
and I'm not,
you know,
showing for the UFC here,

2745
02:30:24.381 --> 02:30:26.390
but I'm saying if athletes are sitting home and they're looking at their

2746
02:30:26.391 --> 02:30:29.000
paycheck at the end of the year saying they're not happy with it,

2747
02:30:29.150 --> 02:30:32.510
well there's a lot of other ways that they can monetize that they can use their

2748
02:30:32.511 --> 02:30:34.880
brand,
they can use what they do to get out there and build.

2749
02:30:35.090 --> 02:30:38.420
And it's not sitting back waiting for sponsors to just hand them a check to put

2750
02:30:38.421 --> 02:30:41.060
on a t shirt or to hold up,
you know,
a,
an energy drink.

2751
02:30:41.300 --> 02:30:44.310
There's other ways to go out there and,
and take care of it.
Yeah.
It's,

2752
02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:48.680
it's tricky for fighters to find that and sort of explore that while they're

2753
02:30:48.681 --> 02:30:53.681
also trying to improve their skillset and improve their conditioning and also to

2754
02:30:53.841 --> 02:30:55.040
have the energy to do it.

2755
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:58.610
Now people are fucking exhausted after they're done training.
You know,

2756
02:30:58.730 --> 02:31:03.310
at the end of the day they're just like,
oh Christ.
It's hard to think of.
I mean,

2757
02:31:03.311 --> 02:31:06.890
I don't know,
Fuck Rhonda does it,
but that chick never runs out of energy.

2758
02:31:06.891 --> 02:31:08.570
I mean she's just a dynamo.
Yeah.

2759
02:31:08.810 --> 02:31:12.140
And that's also one of the reasons why she's so damn successful,

2760
02:31:12.290 --> 02:31:15.050
not just outside of the EOC but as a fighter,
you know,

2761
02:31:15.140 --> 02:31:18.200
cause cause she has that fucking law,
whatever it is.

2762
02:31:18.201 --> 02:31:19.760
And I don't know why I did that.
Wow.

2763
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:24.660
<v 1>Did she's gotten that wrong.
40 smart.
It's like whatever it is,
it's a monster.</v>

2764
02:31:24.661 --> 02:31:27.600
It's a monster inside of her that comes out.
Like,
legitimately,

2765
02:31:27.601 --> 02:31:29.820
she just happens to be hot,
you know?

2766
02:31:29.821 --> 02:31:34.320
But it's all those other things that make her who she is,
you know?

2767
02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:36.360
And it's hard for people to find that.

2768
02:31:36.390 --> 02:31:40.650
She also has that sort of personality that that polemic,
you know,

2769
02:31:40.651 --> 02:31:45.420
sort of like she's,
she's a controversial figure.
Absolutely.
She's,
you know,

2770
02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:49.470
naturally,
you know,
she's naturally a fuck you bitch.
Like that's her.

2771
02:31:49.471 --> 02:31:52.620
Like all that shit you do with Misha Tate on the show and people like she's

2772
02:31:52.621 --> 02:31:57.390
fucking crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I guess what,
everyone's great.
It's crazy.

2773
02:31:57.420 --> 02:32:00.720
They're all crazy.
That's when Jon Jones and Cormier,
when they had their,
uh,

2774
02:32:00.721 --> 02:32:05.070
their mix hot and they didn't know it and they record that.
He's like,
Hey,

2775
02:32:05.071 --> 02:32:09.180
pussy pussies still there.
Like that's the,
that's you,
you guess what?

2776
02:32:09.210 --> 02:32:11.730
That's what you get.
That's the kind of,
you want to,

2777
02:32:11.731 --> 02:32:14.040
you want a guy who's a fucking destroy,
like John Jones,

2778
02:32:14.190 --> 02:32:16.500
you're going to get that guy.
That's what you get.
That's,

2779
02:32:16.600 --> 02:32:19.500
those are the type of guys that win world titles.

2780
02:32:19.501 --> 02:32:22.860
Those are the type of guys they'd become the youngest ever UFC champion.

2781
02:32:22.950 --> 02:32:26.450
There you go.
Those Jon Jones type characters.
I mean,
they're not there.

2782
02:32:26.451 --> 02:32:30.300
They're naturally controversial.
Absolutely.
They're not like the rest of us,

2783
02:32:30.650 --> 02:32:33.030
fortunately or not.
And that's what makes him special.
I agree.

2784
02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:36.480
But I don't know what John is not more more um,

2785
02:32:36.690 --> 02:32:40.020
loved or popular then than he is.

2786
02:32:40.110 --> 02:32:42.030
I don't understand it because in my opinion,

2787
02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:45.330
I will never miss a fucking John John's paper view.

2788
02:32:45.750 --> 02:32:49.740
And I would think that anybody who,
like I've heard people say,
oh,
he's cocky.

2789
02:32:49.741 --> 02:32:54.360
Oh he's this.
And I wonder what the fuck is going on with that.
And I'm,

2790
02:32:54.450 --> 02:32:56.700
and I'm going to throw this out there.
I'm just going to say it.

2791
02:32:56.880 --> 02:33:01.530
I wonder how much of it is racism allow.
I really do.
I did.

2792
02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:03.510
Damn.
Oh,
did you know why?

2793
02:33:03.511 --> 02:33:08.511
Because I think they look at him as this cocky black guy and I think a lot of

2794
02:33:09.271 --> 02:33:10.470
people have an issue with that.

2795
02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:13.230
And I think that if he was a white guy and he was doing the same thing,

2796
02:33:13.440 --> 02:33:17.580
I'll like Chael Sonnen.
I think you'd be way more popular.
Chain was never the,

2797
02:33:17.610 --> 02:33:19.920
the successful athlete did.
John is,

2798
02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:25.400
but I think that Chad was way more successful as a promoter than John Is.

2799
02:33:25.471 --> 02:33:30.471
And John has not been nearly as cocky or outwardly a braggadocious as chail was.

2800
02:33:32.310 --> 02:33:34.610
But somehow or another,
when chail did it,
first of all,
channels,

2801
02:33:34.620 --> 02:33:37.170
very entertaining,
very articulate,

2802
02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:42.830
best shit talker bar.
None in my opinion,
combat sports has ever seen.
Absolutely.

2803
02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:45.210
I said,
I've said he's better than Muhammad Ali and people were like,

2804
02:33:45.211 --> 02:33:47.580
you're crazy.
I'm like,
I'm not crazy.
I'm telling you the truth.

2805
02:33:47.581 --> 02:33:52.080
I think he is a better shit talker.
Me As a fighter.
No,

2806
02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:54.780
no,
not the best fighter,
but as a shit talker,

2807
02:33:54.781 --> 02:33:58.950
I think he's one of the most articulate,
funniest shit talkers ever.
Yeah.
I mean,

2808
02:33:58.951 --> 02:34:00.210
I really do believe that

2809
02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:05.720
<v 2>you think people Chell resonated with the public because we all knew or felt in</v>

2810
02:34:06.351 --> 02:34:09.830
the back of our mind that he wasn't truly serious maybe,

2811
02:34:09.860 --> 02:34:13.850
and we were appreciating his art,
his skill of doing it where with John,
we think,

2812
02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:17.980
yeah,
maybe he's serious about this,
isn't it?
Maybe.
And I'm a of John like you,

2813
02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:20.810
I'd love to watch that kid fight guy fight,
you know?
Yeah,

2814
02:34:21.070 --> 02:34:22.600
he's a super and I think he,

2815
02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:25.150
he goes through a couple more wins and beat some tough guys.

2816
02:34:25.151 --> 02:34:30.040
If he beats core me a,
he will become the Ali of our sport.

2817
02:34:30.041 --> 02:34:33.790
He has that type of young,
brash,
outspoken outlook.

2818
02:34:33.791 --> 02:34:36.860
And I want to see the next chapter two there,

2819
02:34:36.861 --> 02:34:38.950
the second act of John Jones and then the third act.

2820
02:34:38.951 --> 02:34:42.610
I'm really excited as just a fan of the sport to follow his career,

2821
02:34:42.611 --> 02:34:46.960
follow his arc and you know,
um,
friends,
you know,
with core may of course also.

2822
02:34:46.961 --> 02:34:48.220
So I'm not going to pick a horse in that one,

2823
02:34:48.580 --> 02:34:50.560
but it'd be really interesting to see how John Goes.

2824
02:34:50.910 --> 02:34:53.100
<v 1>It is without a doubt.
I just find it,</v>

2825
02:34:53.160 --> 02:34:57.390
I always found it odd when everybody would get upset at him and say that they

2826
02:34:57.391 --> 02:35:02.391
didn't like that he's cocky or that he says like he's 25 and he's the UFC light

2827
02:35:04.290 --> 02:35:08.910
heavyweight champion.
He's the youngest ever UFC champion.

2828
02:35:09.060 --> 02:35:13.770
He destroyed show gun to win the title and I mean destroyed.

2829
02:35:13.890 --> 02:35:18.030
He threw a flying knee and hit shogun and the Chin five seconds into their
fight.

2830
02:35:18.300 --> 02:35:21.960
I mean,
Jon Jones is a mother Fucker,
period.

2831
02:35:21.961 --> 02:35:23.340
He's a motherfucker.

2832
02:35:23.670 --> 02:35:27.630
But for whatever reason people have had an issue with that.

2833
02:35:27.631 --> 02:35:29.190
And I know I'm going to get a bunch of hate tweets.

2834
02:35:29.220 --> 02:35:32.670
Woke you in your fucking bullshit.
Fucking we got white guilt

2835
02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:36.000
racism.
That's okay.

2836
02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:39.390
I'm still reeling from the fucking pro wrestling fans mad at me for the last

2837
02:35:39.391 --> 02:35:42.740
episode.
I'm not really folks.
It doesn't bother me.
Uh,

2838
02:35:43.020 --> 02:35:45.870
pro wrestling fans were really mad at me cause I was my friend Tony Hinchcliffe

2839
02:35:45.871 --> 02:35:49.710
was on,
I was mocking him and joking around about pro wrestling.
I really don't,

2840
02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:53.370
uh,
just for the record,
I don't hate pro wrestling at all.

2841
02:35:53.430 --> 02:35:56.550
And I loved it when I was in high school.
When I was in high school,

2842
02:35:56.551 --> 02:36:00.420
I was a fucking huge pro wrestling fan.
Me and my friend Steven Arduino,

2843
02:36:00.421 --> 02:36:03.120
we would get together and fucking,
he,
we were on the wrestling team together.

2844
02:36:03.121 --> 02:36:06.820
We'd always joke around about being super fly off the ropes.
You know,

2845
02:36:07.030 --> 02:36:10.920
I was a huge wrestling fan,
but I was 14,
you know,
do I watch it today?
No,

2846
02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:12.690
but I understand.
Appreciate it.

2847
02:36:12.870 --> 02:36:16.410
I was busting my friend Tony's balls cause it made for a fun podcast,

2848
02:36:16.411 --> 02:36:19.710
but it fell fucking wave of misspelled.

2849
02:36:19.711 --> 02:36:22.110
Hate towards that have come my way.

2850
02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:27.240
Holy Shit folks relax.
There's other things to be upset about.
Okay.

2851
02:36:27.450 --> 02:36:31.440
I don't,
I'm not really up.
I'm not really mad at yeah.
Settled down.

2852
02:36:32.250 --> 02:36:32.970
But um,

2853
02:36:32.970 --> 02:36:37.260
I'm probably going to get an equal amount from the area and race then there you

2854
02:36:37.261 --> 02:36:41.430
go.
Mad At me for defending Jon Jones,
the Cookie Negro.

2855
02:36:41.890 --> 02:36:45.150
You know,
look,
I think that,
I really think there's something to that.

2856
02:36:45.151 --> 02:36:49.590
I think people want a guy who was so physically gifted and young and brash and

2857
02:36:49.591 --> 02:36:50.520
black and rich.

2858
02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:55.530
They want him to have more humility or fake humility as it were.

2859
02:36:55.531 --> 02:36:57.360
And I think John's trying that a little bit.

2860
02:36:57.610 --> 02:37:00.330
That's one of the reasons why core me.
I was like,
you are so fake.

2861
02:37:00.331 --> 02:37:03.330
Like you're so fake.
The core.
Mia was saying that to him because he's,

2862
02:37:03.331 --> 02:37:07.140
I think he's trying to counteract how people feel about him.

2863
02:37:07.390 --> 02:37:11.950
<v 2>It's gotta be hard to be that young and successful and still emotionally</v>

2864
02:37:12.250 --> 02:37:16.370
developing.
I don't want to say mature,
but he's still learning to be a man right.

2865
02:37:16.371 --> 02:37:19.790
In his own skin and to have that type of success.
So he does.

2866
02:37:20.420 --> 02:37:22.550
He deserves to be fucking cocky for what?
He's a cop.

2867
02:37:22.790 --> 02:37:27.180
<v 1>No doubt what's going.
It's,
it's inevitable that he's cocky.
If it's,</v>

2868
02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:32.360
it's almost impossible not to be at that age and at that level of

2869
02:37:32.421 --> 02:37:37.280
accomplishment.
I think everyone is evolving.
Yeah.
I mean,
you evolve till you die.

2870
02:37:37.580 --> 02:37:41.060
You change and grow and learn.
If you're not,
you're,
you're,
you know,

2871
02:37:41.061 --> 02:37:44.690
you're stagnant and you're rotting away because I think I'm a better,

2872
02:37:45.050 --> 02:37:49.670
whatever I'm better at now,
I'm better than I was a year ago.
And if I wasn't,

2873
02:37:49.671 --> 02:37:51.650
I'd be disappointed.
And I'm 47 I mean,

2874
02:37:51.651 --> 02:37:55.700
when I'm 48 I guarantee you I'll be looking back saying whatever I do,

2875
02:37:55.701 --> 02:37:57.620
whether it's podcasting or comedy,

2876
02:37:57.621 --> 02:38:00.860
I'll be better at 48 that I am at 47 and when I'm not that,

2877
02:38:00.861 --> 02:38:04.730
it means I'm fucking dying.
It means the gear stop turning,

2878
02:38:04.731 --> 02:38:08.990
the nootropic stop working,
the testosterone replacement.
Failing fucking,

2879
02:38:08.991 --> 02:38:12.050
there's gonna come a wall.
You're going to hit that wall.
I haven't hit it yet.

2880
02:38:12.051 --> 02:38:13.460
When I hit it,
I,
I'll know I hit it.

2881
02:38:13.850 --> 02:38:17.600
But I think that when a guy like Jon Jones is 30 and looks back at who he was

2882
02:38:17.601 --> 02:38:18.860
and he was 25 yeah,

2883
02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:22.470
he'll have said some things that he didn't think he should have said.
But the,

2884
02:38:22.540 --> 02:38:27.290
the trials and tribulations of being that guy are almost unimaginable to just

2885
02:38:27.291 --> 02:38:32.060
distress.
And this,
the,
the,
the pressures and all that jazz,

2886
02:38:32.120 --> 02:38:34.040
absolutely no shit

2887
02:38:34.300 --> 02:38:37.000
<v 2>with now the scrutiny that's on a guy like that,</v>

2888
02:38:37.001 --> 02:38:40.240
with all the social media available,
all the,
you know,
cameras in his face.

2889
02:38:40.241 --> 02:38:43.870
Just the attention at it as 25 year old,
all of us,

2890
02:38:43.871 --> 02:38:47.530
everybody listening at 25 we're all fucking idiots.
And if you're 25 right now,

2891
02:38:47.531 --> 02:38:50.680
you're gonna look back 10 years and be like,
Jesus,
I was an idiot.
You know?

2892
02:38:50.740 --> 02:38:52.540
So it's fun to watch.

2893
02:38:52.570 --> 02:38:56.140
You know what John's going through and I would love to see him just go straight.

2894
02:38:56.141 --> 02:39:00.010
He'll fuck you all,
you know,
double fingers up in the air.

2895
02:39:00.011 --> 02:39:02.470
I'm the best in the fucking world.
Fuck you.
And not try and play.

2896
02:39:02.620 --> 02:39:07.180
Not pandered to the comments anymore and not try and be the Christian dude,

2897
02:39:07.181 --> 02:39:09.010
not trying,
you know,
make people happy.

2898
02:39:09.070 --> 02:39:11.710
<v 1>I think that's real though,
I think is a part of him.
Look,</v>

2899
02:39:11.711 --> 02:39:15.100
he has the fucking biblical tattoo on his chest.

2900
02:39:15.101 --> 02:39:16.880
I don't think he put that there for a show.
Yeah.

2901
02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:19.270
I think there's part of him that really feels like that,

2902
02:39:19.271 --> 02:39:23.610
but there's also the part of them that's this,
this remorseless warrior.
Sure.

2903
02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:26.120
You know,
there's both,
there's both of those things.
It's a,

2904
02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:28.540
it's a constant conflict going on.
I mean,

2905
02:39:28.541 --> 02:39:30.340
I think he definitely tries to be a good person.

2906
02:39:30.341 --> 02:39:32.780
I think he definitely tries to be a good father.
I think there's definitely,
sure.

2907
02:39:32.890 --> 02:39:37.580
But he also is the guy who choked the older machines to sleep.
You know,
he's,

2908
02:39:37.581 --> 02:39:41.920
he's also the guy that,
that submitted.
Vitor Belfort.
He,
he's also,
he's,

2909
02:39:41.921 --> 02:39:43.260
he's just a real destroyed.

2910
02:39:43.350 --> 02:39:45.570
<v 2>He,
uh,
he,
so when channel was fighting him,
I was,</v>

2911
02:39:45.571 --> 02:39:46.740
I was helping child for that one.

2912
02:39:46.950 --> 02:39:50.100
And John like wouldn't look at shale and like there's a photo and I made a

2913
02:39:50.101 --> 02:39:52.740
comment on the phone,
like,
you know,
Dolan's must be scared.

2914
02:39:52.741 --> 02:39:55.590
He's not even looking at jail is just,
you know,
some,
you know,
hype in the fight.

2915
02:39:55.980 --> 02:39:59.280
And John saw me backstage and he's like,
man,
he's like,
what the fuck?
He's like,

2916
02:39:59.281 --> 02:40:00.950
why are you saying I'm not scared of him?
Like it was,
you know,

2917
02:40:00.970 --> 02:40:03.020
in my face a little bit on that goddamn champ,
like

2918
02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:07.920
the fibro.
Right.
And then,
you know,
I see him like,
you know,

2919
02:40:07.921 --> 02:40:10.380
a week or two later and he was just such a sweet guy and he's like,
man,

2920
02:40:10.381 --> 02:40:12.420
I'm sorry about that.
He was like,
oh,
I hyped up at the fight.

2921
02:40:12.421 --> 02:40:13.980
I know you're just kidding.
And he's like,
I

2922
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:18.750
<v 3>was just in that zone.
So the dichotomy of character,
you know,
in my face,
like,</v>

2923
02:40:18.900 --> 02:40:22.620
Yo,
fuck you.
And then remorseful afterwards,
not for African man.

2924
02:40:22.621 --> 02:40:25.350
If you were really bad about that,
dolce you're a good dude.
Like Blah Blah,
blah,

2925
02:40:25.351 --> 02:40:28.050
blah.
So yeah,
and I think that's real.

2926
02:40:28.290 --> 02:40:32.730
I don't think he was just doing like some sort of PR.
No,
it was,

2927
02:40:32.731 --> 02:40:35.700
we were alone.
There was nobody around.
Nobody watching both times.
Yeah.

2928
02:40:35.701 --> 02:40:38.040
And it's not,
I don't think it's damage control.
I think,
you know,

2929
02:40:38.041 --> 02:40:43.020
it's a fuck the unimaginable pressure of being that guy.

2930
02:40:43.110 --> 02:40:48.090
Yeah.
You know,
and no one is rumbled Johnson's out there that are rising up,

2931
02:40:48.091 --> 02:40:52.170
putting people to sleep,
you know,
rumble Johnson with man.
Whew.

2932
02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:54.240
He's the scariest in my opinion.

2933
02:40:54.270 --> 02:40:57.300
He can do things to you that other guys can't do.
Absolutely.

2934
02:40:57.301 --> 02:41:00.750
That fucking fight with him.
And Phil Davis opened a lot of people's eyes.

2935
02:41:00.750 --> 02:41:05.750
That was terrifying to watch Phil Davis just in this full defensive mode that

2936
02:41:05.821 --> 02:41:10.200
we've never seen him in before.
Fill it and get him down one city.
No,
no.

2937
02:41:10.230 --> 02:41:13.950
He didn't even come close.
That's a scary man right there.
Yeah.

2938
02:41:13.951 --> 02:41:16.560
And Rumble connects on anybody.
It's 99 yeah.

2939
02:41:16.590 --> 02:41:21.270
What he did to fucking little nog man.
Whew.
I mean people beating Little Nog,

2940
02:41:21.271 --> 02:41:23.840
but they haven't beaten the fuck out of him like that.
No.

2941
02:41:23.940 --> 02:41:27.270
He beat the fuck out a little nog and put them to sleep.
Yeah,
I mean,

2942
02:41:27.271 --> 02:41:31.230
that was terrifying.
Yeah.
He's a terrifying guy.
Absolutely.

2943
02:41:31.380 --> 02:41:35.190
It'd be fun to see.
He started out,
he is a perfect weight cutting example.

2944
02:41:35.820 --> 02:41:40.380
He started out fighting as a fucking welter weight,
weighing 230 pounds,

2945
02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:43.380
dropping down to one 70 insanity.

2946
02:41:43.381 --> 02:41:48.000
And we spoke multiple times about the possibility of working,
and I told them,
no,

2947
02:41:48.870 --> 02:41:53.220
I don't think it's good and I think you should move up.
And I,
oh,
he's a good guy.

2948
02:41:53.221 --> 02:41:55.830
For anybody that doesn't know that,
he just know that persona of Anthony Johnson.

2949
02:41:55.831 --> 02:41:57.330
He's a really a good smart guy.

2950
02:41:57.870 --> 02:42:02.430
And he felt committed to one 70 for whatever reason at that time.
But you know,

2951
02:42:02.460 --> 02:42:07.140
going to one 85 two oh five and he's had success in heavyweight also,
right?
Yeah.

2952
02:42:07.250 --> 02:42:09.930
Yeah.
Success to have you at two oh five I think that's where he's,

2953
02:42:09.931 --> 02:42:10.711
he's just a killer.

2954
02:42:10.711 --> 02:42:14.670
I obviously couldn't make 85 against bell fort back in the day to a five it's

2955
02:42:14.671 --> 02:42:16.710
just a nasty weight class for that dude.
And he's not a young,

2956
02:42:16.711 --> 02:42:18.790
he's not an old guy either 30 yeah,

2957
02:42:19.030 --> 02:42:22.380
he's 30 and he's also emotionally very mature now.

2958
02:42:22.410 --> 02:42:24.570
He's a different guy and he's not,
you know,

2959
02:42:24.571 --> 02:42:27.720
he would get overwhelmed and fights like the cost check fight or some of the

2960
02:42:27.721 --> 02:42:29.620
high pressure fights that he had before.
Sure.

2961
02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:32.880
But I think also having the failure,

2962
02:42:33.210 --> 02:42:35.820
the losing his position in the UFC,

2963
02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:39.240
leaving going somewhere else and then deciding to fight all the way up at

2964
02:42:39.241 --> 02:42:42.870
heavyweight.
Yeah.
Andrea Alaskan fucked him up as a heavyweight.

2965
02:42:43.050 --> 02:42:47.490
He's a monster man.
Yeah.
He's a fucking monster rumble Johnson.
And it's,
again,

2966
02:42:47.491 --> 02:42:50.790
he's gone through the journey and he's become a better man because of that

2967
02:42:50.791 --> 02:42:52.740
journey and talks openly about it.
I mean,

2968
02:42:52.741 --> 02:42:56.850
after he fought little Nog and I interviewed him and he thanked the UFC for

2969
02:42:56.851 --> 02:42:58.070
cutting him.
It's awesome.

2970
02:42:58.071 --> 02:43:00.300
It's like just one of the best things that ever happened to him that made him

2971
02:43:00.301 --> 02:43:03.490
wake up and realize what he was doing wrong.
And he was saying,
yeah,
and,

2972
02:43:03.491 --> 02:43:06.870
and I said about the weight cutting things like,
yeah,
don't cut so much weight.

2973
02:43:07.780 --> 02:43:11.860
Feel good about it.
He's a fucking big guy,
man.
Fucking big dude.

2974
02:43:11.860 --> 02:43:15.190
He's a big guy too.
I would see him in between fights.

2975
02:43:15.191 --> 02:43:17.570
It was unimaginable that I can make one seven.

2976
02:43:17.820 --> 02:43:21.670
He said he would go in the sauna for an hour just to lose a pound like back when

2977
02:43:21.671 --> 02:43:26.020
he was making 70.
Oh my God.
Just killing,
killing,
killing his body to get it done.

2978
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:27.980
His body failed.
Um,

2979
02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:31.360
one of the fights [inaudible] or one of the fights where you didn't make weight.

2980
02:43:32.080 --> 02:43:36.700
Body failed.
Like his legs stop working.
Yeah.
Like he couldn't walk,
you know?

2981
02:43:36.701 --> 02:43:39.820
I mean,
he was on death's door.
Literally.
Yeah.

2982
02:43:39.821 --> 02:43:43.240
Literally fucking how about Barao look,
we,

2983
02:43:43.340 --> 02:43:44.830
when we were almost out of time here,

2984
02:43:44.831 --> 02:43:49.360
but that's a perfect example of a guy was fucking up cutting weight the day of

2985
02:43:49.361 --> 02:43:51.940
the weigh ins.
They change opponents.

2986
02:43:52.210 --> 02:43:55.990
He gets pulled out of a fucking title fight because he can't make weight and he

2987
02:43:55.991 --> 02:43:59.560
falls asleep.
He blacks out getting out of the tub and bumped his head.

2988
02:43:59.890 --> 02:44:03.220
It's a comedy of errors right there.
Not to point fingers.

2989
02:44:03.221 --> 02:44:05.710
I think the whole team has to accept responsibility for that.

2990
02:44:05.890 --> 02:44:09.400
Taking the fight way too soon,
pushing for the fight,
taking the fight.

2991
02:44:09.401 --> 02:44:10.120
The kid had,
you know,

2992
02:44:10.120 --> 02:44:12.880
was concussed in the fight against the first fight against Dillashaw and he's

2993
02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:13.781
fighting three months later.

2994
02:44:13.781 --> 02:44:16.720
They should have been out for six months before they even scheduled.

2995
02:44:16.721 --> 02:44:18.640
Even thought about scheduling a flight.
We all know that.

2996
02:44:18.670 --> 02:44:21.790
I agree 100% and then to have to cut all the way back down again.

2997
02:44:21.791 --> 02:44:24.460
There's no way we can expect it as body respond.

2998
02:44:24.490 --> 02:44:27.280
I'm not sure how they cut weight,
but I know those guys,

2999
02:44:27.281 --> 02:44:29.270
they don't cut weight in the healthiest manner.

3000
02:44:29.290 --> 02:44:32.200
They really struggle and sacrifice to get down.
We see them all the time,

3001
02:44:32.440 --> 02:44:36.550
so they just tortured this poor fucking kid and then you don't let an athlete

3002
02:44:36.580 --> 02:44:40.180
just from experience.
You don't let an athlete stand up.
Athletes,

3003
02:44:40.181 --> 02:44:40.990
if you're in the bathtub,

3004
02:44:40.990 --> 02:44:44.650
you roll out of the bath tub onto the floor and you slowly stand up.

3005
02:44:44.651 --> 02:44:47.370
You use hand grips.
You have two people in there to help you stand.

3006
02:44:47.380 --> 02:44:51.280
Never should a coach's hand be off you and whatever cream allegedly they put on

3007
02:44:51.281 --> 02:44:55.360
them.
That stuff.
Abilene and stuff doesn't work.
I have the analytics to show it.

3008
02:44:55.361 --> 02:44:59.440
I'm not bashing any companies,
but Abilene is not designed for weight cutting.
No,

3009
02:44:59.441 --> 02:45:03.940
it's not.
It's a moisturizer.
Moisturizer and it's a lot of these old wives tales.

3010
02:45:04.330 --> 02:45:08.610
That's the Epson salt and alcohol rubbing alcohol like I was talking to story

3011
02:45:08.611 --> 02:45:12.130
before about all I'll,
so you put alcohol in the Tub and what that does,

3012
02:45:12.131 --> 02:45:15.490
those fumes,
they create respiratory distress.
They tons of headaches.

3013
02:45:15.610 --> 02:45:18.010
Chris Kamozi was kid.
He's like,
what the fuck man?
They came in,

3014
02:45:18.011 --> 02:45:19.660
they put alcohol and the Tub.
It's like now I've got,

3015
02:45:19.730 --> 02:45:23.590
now I've got a headache because of what all there is team did downstairs in the

3016
02:45:23.591 --> 02:45:25.270
spot at the fucking hotel.
It was,

3017
02:45:25.271 --> 02:45:29.800
they poured it into the spa at the hotel where everybody else got in there.
Yeah.

3018
02:45:31.860 --> 02:45:34.930
W world is is come on your boat.
EPSOM salts is good for you.

3019
02:45:34.931 --> 02:45:38.070
It's a natural source of magnesium.
It's good to take Epsom salt baths.

3020
02:45:38.090 --> 02:45:40.300
One of the best ways for your body to absorb magnesium.

3021
02:45:40.301 --> 02:45:44.740
It's one of the added benefits of sensory deprivation tanks because the,
this,

3022
02:45:44.741 --> 02:45:46.960
the sale he needed water is absent salts.
You actually,

3023
02:45:46.961 --> 02:45:50.290
your body actually absorbs magnesium.
It's a great way to get it excellent skin.

3024
02:45:50.530 --> 02:45:55.000
It's not going to make you lose additional weight and that's something that we

3025
02:45:55.001 --> 02:45:57.760
can argue back and forth and people listening or I do that all the time,

3026
02:45:57.940 --> 02:46:01.390
try to do the same tub with the same temperature in the same physical state with

3027
02:46:01.391 --> 02:46:03.490
and without the Epson Salts and watch what you lose.

3028
02:46:03.491 --> 02:46:07.030
It's going to be almost identical.
And you have all this document.
I do,
I do.

3029
02:46:07.170 --> 02:46:10.010
Well that's a difference as you,
a lot of these that are,
you know,

3030
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:13.730
<v 2>these weight cutting guys and these people that people get brought in is the</v>

3031
02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:18.350
amount of documentation that you have and the amount of just raw data just from

3032
02:46:18.351 --> 02:46:21.710
dealing with various athletes.
It's all,
everything we do with database,

3033
02:46:21.770 --> 02:46:25.040
it's database experience.
Days it based,
it's research based.
I mean it's,

3034
02:46:25.041 --> 02:46:29.120
it's proven and then it's this never perfected but it's always evolving.

3035
02:46:29.420 --> 02:46:32.630
What worked last time against,
you know,
with everybody.
Well,

3036
02:46:32.631 --> 02:46:35.060
that's what we're sticking with and if something was an anomaly,

3037
02:46:35.061 --> 02:46:38.270
what we consider it and we look at t look into what we research it,

3038
02:46:38.271 --> 02:46:42.620
but we don't add it to new protocol.
Is there any failure that you've had?

3039
02:46:42.621 --> 02:46:46.100
Like is there any one fighter that you worked with you like man,

3040
02:46:46.101 --> 02:46:48.410
I wish I could go do that one again.
Um,

3041
02:46:48.570 --> 02:46:51.830
now I've never had an athlete Miss Weight other than myself.

3042
02:46:51.831 --> 02:46:54.260
Freshman Year of high school and the state wrestling too.

3043
02:46:54.310 --> 02:46:56.540
I don't think that counts.
I'm not going to just say it to freshman year.

3044
02:46:57.740 --> 02:46:59.930
No athlete under my watch has ever missed weight.

3045
02:46:59.931 --> 02:47:03.200
But the one I would like to Redo,
I mean the Hendricks one in Dallas,

3046
02:47:03.201 --> 02:47:06.140
I would have loved to have make weight on the first time with that one.

3047
02:47:06.141 --> 02:47:08.420
But there was a whole comedy of errors and Phil also,

3048
02:47:08.421 --> 02:47:11.120
you've got to stop to think about the fact that he's pretty seriously injured

3049
02:47:11.420 --> 02:47:15.080
yet torn Bicep,
cracked Shin,
pretty fucking crazy in the first place.

3050
02:47:15.110 --> 02:47:17.210
Absolutely medical checks in the middle of the day.

3051
02:47:17.211 --> 02:47:20.090
We had to stop cutting and then start cutting again.
We left the scale.

3052
02:47:20.091 --> 02:47:23.690
This is our fault for leaving the scale and a closed and open the closed or open

3053
02:47:23.691 --> 02:47:26.300
gym,
sorry with a bunch of knuckleheads jumping on his scale.

3054
02:47:26.301 --> 02:47:30.350
So there was quite a few things and looking back that we could have done better.

3055
02:47:30.350 --> 02:47:34.020
I would have loved to have rewound that one.
Um,
you know,
I should have got in,

3056
02:47:34.030 --> 02:47:37.970
had another commissioner come over and check the scale again when the first

3057
02:47:37.971 --> 02:47:41.180
commissioner called them at one 71 and a hair one 71 and a half,

3058
02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:42.700
which he wasn't sending one and a half.

3059
02:47:42.701 --> 02:47:44.800
He was 70 and a half and he had his underwear on.

3060
02:47:44.810 --> 02:47:48.560
There was quite a few guys who had issues with that scale.
In all fairness,

3061
02:47:48.561 --> 02:47:52.130
there was a backstage scale that weighed very different than the onstage scale,

3062
02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:54.500
which can happen occasionally and it's a real issue.

3063
02:47:54.501 --> 02:47:57.740
Like people were calling for calibration for recalibration and they're like,

3064
02:47:57.741 --> 02:48:02.090
we can't recalibrate.
That does happen.
Certain commissions and time to time.

3065
02:48:02.091 --> 02:48:06.890
It's really,
it's tricky.
It's tricky.
So it's all,
it varies with commission.

3066
02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:08.900
A lot of folks don't realize that like when you see it,

3067
02:48:09.140 --> 02:48:14.030
like a few fighters miss weight oftentimes because the backstage scale is

3068
02:48:14.031 --> 02:48:16.160
different.
Like they thought they were wrong,
they were fine,

3069
02:48:16.161 --> 02:48:19.970
and they get on the onstage scale and it's a different weight.
Absolutely.

3070
02:48:20.450 --> 02:48:21.111
We've seen,

3071
02:48:21.111 --> 02:48:24.530
I've been at events and I won't say the promotion where the scale got dropped

3072
02:48:24.740 --> 02:48:28.390
and then you step all,
you get on the scale at the early day,
pre ends,

3073
02:48:28.410 --> 02:48:32.600
a scale got dropped somehow,
you know,
between the venue and the,
you know,

3074
02:48:32.601 --> 02:48:34.910
the hotel and now all of a sudden it's got a crazy reading.

3075
02:48:34.911 --> 02:48:37.310
Like you're saying right now.
Um,
they're last minute.

3076
02:48:37.311 --> 02:48:39.230
The scale gets switched because it gets,
you know,

3077
02:48:39.290 --> 02:48:41.120
it goes to the wrong place or it doesn't get through.

3078
02:48:41.390 --> 02:48:43.880
So I've seen almost every Addis you I've been at,
you know,

3079
02:48:43.940 --> 02:48:48.650
I don't even know how many Wayne's now and it's not as easy to weigh in properly

3080
02:48:48.651 --> 02:48:51.380
when you're trying to keep the athlete as healthy as possible.

3081
02:48:51.530 --> 02:48:54.410
You're not just trying to get the athlete to 170 pounds and just leave him there

3082
02:48:54.411 --> 02:48:55.244
for four hours.

3083
02:48:55.370 --> 02:48:59.390
You're trying to minimize that period as much as possible and really just skim

3084
02:48:59.391 --> 02:49:01.670
the top of the wait and let them bounce right back up.

3085
02:49:01.671 --> 02:49:03.050
Cause we're trying to preserve their health,

3086
02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:06.830
which is going to increase their ability to perform to the best of their
ability.

3087
02:49:07.110 --> 02:49:09.540
So you know like with Hendrix and the weight,

3088
02:49:09.570 --> 02:49:11.610
it was a matter of getting them out of here,

3089
02:49:11.611 --> 02:49:15.750
get them calm again because he's freezing cold.
It was so cold in that place.

3090
02:49:15.751 --> 02:49:17.730
It's freezing cold,
shaken.
I'm on the scale.

3091
02:49:17.740 --> 02:49:20.280
The chaos begins title fight on the line.
Let's get 'em out of here.

3092
02:49:20.281 --> 02:49:23.760
Let's calm them down and then let's get the weight off of him.

3093
02:49:23.761 --> 02:49:25.710
Let's keep him healthy.
Let's keep them confidence,

3094
02:49:25.711 --> 02:49:29.700
keep them happy and get them back on.
So that's what I would like to Redo.

3095
02:49:29.701 --> 02:49:32.910
And when you kind of guy like Hendrickson has a torn bicep and a correction,

3096
02:49:32.911 --> 02:49:35.640
how close were they to not taking that fight?
There was,

3097
02:49:35.641 --> 02:49:38.070
it wasn't even a consideration.
What was it going to?

3098
02:49:38.071 --> 02:49:40.170
Even if the arm was completely useless,

3099
02:49:40.180 --> 02:49:41.300
there's going to just fight with his left.

3100
02:49:41.310 --> 02:49:43.800
He was going to go and fight with one hand.
Yeah.
Fuck,

3101
02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:45.600
that's fucking Johnny Hendricks says,
well I love the kid.

3102
02:49:46.020 --> 02:49:49.880
There's no quit in him no matter what.
There's just no quick,
no.

3103
02:49:49.890 --> 02:49:53.310
Seems like ridiculous.
Like if you have a torn ACL and you can't move,

3104
02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:56.130
I find anyway,
if I was,
if it were up to me,

3105
02:49:56.430 --> 02:50:00.420
I wouldn't let my athlete fight in that one and that's either good or bad.

3106
02:50:00.421 --> 02:50:01.530
We can debate that.
Also,

3107
02:50:01.710 --> 02:50:04.620
I'm not going to put an injured athlete out there to get his bicep torn off and

3108
02:50:04.621 --> 02:50:08.550
possibly ruin or possibly lose his only opportunity to fight for a world title.

3109
02:50:08.580 --> 02:50:09.540
Let's say Robbie went up there,

3110
02:50:09.541 --> 02:50:12.960
one that last round or Johnny had the default because he tore the bicep and

3111
02:50:12.961 --> 02:50:16.500
couldn't lift his arm.
Ref saw that judge saw that medical,
you know,

3112
02:50:16.620 --> 02:50:19.320
doctor saw that called the fight on this,
on the stool.

3113
02:50:19.470 --> 02:50:22.950
Crazy things happen and then he loses his bit and now it goes to the back of the

3114
02:50:22.951 --> 02:50:25.410
line.
He's got to fight three,
four fights against it.
Stack division.

3115
02:50:25.411 --> 02:50:28.680
Maybe he never gets there again.
So that would be one consideration.

3116
02:50:28.681 --> 02:50:32.100
But a guy like Johnny man two time,
Ncaa Division One national champion,

3117
02:50:32.340 --> 02:50:34.260
he goes out there and he knows how to get it,
get it done,

3118
02:50:34.470 --> 02:50:36.000
and that's ultimately he's the boss.

3119
02:50:36.250 --> 02:50:39.040
<v 1>The mental toughness that comes with that amateur wrestling background that we</v>

3120
02:50:39.041 --> 02:50:42.220
were talking about.
It's really a,
it's a real thing.
It's real.

3121
02:50:42.221 --> 02:50:45.160
They are all of them.
All the Ma,
all,

3122
02:50:45.490 --> 02:50:49.900
all amateur wrestling champions are fucking mentally strong and special.

3123
02:50:49.930 --> 02:50:53.950
Special breed of human.
Absolutely.
And it's crazy.
It's like there's,
you know,

3124
02:50:53.951 --> 02:50:57.610
we're talking about how you should rest and you should train smart and you

3125
02:50:57.611 --> 02:51:02.230
shouldn't overtrain but it's like the overtraining is what made them so mentally

3126
02:51:02.231 --> 02:51:04.390
strong and that becomes one of their biggest weapons.
Yeah.

3127
02:51:04.540 --> 02:51:07.060
So it's such a catch 22

3128
02:51:07.150 --> 02:51:11.890
<v 2>yeah.
I think that the genetic superiors rise in that area.</v>

3129
02:51:12.010 --> 02:51:14.950
I think a lot of,
I mean,
not many guys actually make it to that,

3130
02:51:15.130 --> 02:51:19.540
the top of that podium and the genetic superiors make it to the top where

3131
02:51:19.541 --> 02:51:23.860
they're able to be the anomaly,
the outlier,
where the rest of us,

3132
02:51:23.861 --> 02:51:27.610
we're just not able to,
we break somewhere along the way due to whatever reason.

3133
02:51:27.970 --> 02:51:31.330
Um,
but it's not in their best.
I don't think it's,

3134
02:51:31.331 --> 02:51:34.300
it's part of the proper longevity protocol.
You know,

3135
02:51:34.301 --> 02:51:37.120
you see a lot of wrestlers in their fifties and sixties and they're kind of

3136
02:51:37.150 --> 02:51:40.690
fucked up.
Fucked up.
Dan Gables fucked up,

3137
02:51:40.750 --> 02:51:43.630
but they got Olympic gold metals and they have some things at,

3138
02:51:43.631 --> 02:51:46.630
some of us will never have.
So it's the risk reward.
Well,
Mark Coleman was like,

3139
02:51:46.631 --> 02:51:50.920
what,
48 49 he has a hip replacement already.
Yeah.
Crazy.
Yeah,
it's crazy.

3140
02:51:50.921 --> 02:51:54.520
It's still wrestling with this.
He's,
he's a crazy,
crazy bitch.
Right?

3141
02:51:54.521 --> 02:51:55.890
He's an animal.
Same

3142
02:51:55.890 --> 02:52:00.570
<v 1>thing we were talking about that just a tough mother fuckers.
Um,
this,</v>

3143
02:52:00.900 --> 02:52:05.860
I dunno if this is real or not,
um,
is,
or I have a question.
Is there,

3144
02:52:05.970 --> 02:52:08.620
the is like a piece of protein.

3145
02:52:09.110 --> 02:52:14.110
I'm like say like a 10 ounces of fish versus 10 ounces of lamb or some or elk or

3146
02:52:16.181 --> 02:52:16.960
game meat.

3147
02:52:16.960 --> 02:52:21.960
Is there a higher quality protein and some protein more effective to some

3148
02:52:22.631 --> 02:52:25.330
animals?
Do they have more energy?

3149
02:52:25.360 --> 02:52:30.040
I mean is there more energy in a grass fed piece of beef versus a a corn fed

3150
02:52:30.041 --> 02:52:30.874
piece of beef?

3151
02:52:31.250 --> 02:52:36.110
<v 2>Yes,
and this is now my opinion based upon a lot of scientific research.</v>

3152
02:52:36.140 --> 02:52:38.390
There's other research that says the opposite.

3153
02:52:38.391 --> 02:52:41.690
So now we're just going to throw it up in the air.
So my philosophy,

3154
02:52:41.691 --> 02:52:42.860
the dolce diet principles,

3155
02:52:42.861 --> 02:52:46.670
number one is earth grown nutrients and that's eating real food from its natural

3156
02:52:46.671 --> 02:52:50.930
source in its natural habitat.
Raised and bred in the natural way.

3157
02:52:51.080 --> 02:52:54.740
You cannot beat that when it comes to nutrient quality nutrient density.

3158
02:52:54.950 --> 02:52:59.450
And that's what we always go after.
So I want line caught fish,
salmon primarily.

3159
02:52:59.451 --> 02:53:03.950
That's one of my top choice line.
Caught Salmon,
excellent grass fed beef.

3160
02:53:04.100 --> 02:53:08.850
And when I say grass fed beef or meat,
I want that roaming in,
you know,
the,
the,

3161
02:53:08.851 --> 02:53:11.220
the trees somewhere.
And I want to,
you know,

3162
02:53:11.540 --> 02:53:14.840
take it out myself with a bow or with a bullet where it doesn't even know any

3163
02:53:14.841 --> 02:53:18.950
humans within a hundred miles.
That's the best possible.
So there's no anxiety,

3164
02:53:18.951 --> 02:53:21.620
there's no quarters.
All,
there's no stress state.
There's no,
you know,

3165
02:53:21.621 --> 02:53:25.430
it's eating the exact food it's supposed to be.
Um,
it has no illness,
no injuries,

3166
02:53:25.580 --> 02:53:30.380
no disease,
no chemicals.
Um,
same thing,
really anything with your vegetables,

3167
02:53:30.381 --> 02:53:34.820
with your spinach,
with your,
your blueberries,
the most natural cannot be beat.

3168
02:53:34.821 --> 02:53:39.290
And that's what really defines my knee.
That's the number one principle.

3169
02:53:39.291 --> 02:53:41.390
If you're only eating earth,
grow nutrients,
real food,

3170
02:53:41.630 --> 02:53:43.190
and you don't pay attention to the time of day,

3171
02:53:43.191 --> 02:53:44.510
you don't pay attention to the quantity,

3172
02:53:44.660 --> 02:53:47.450
you're going to be much better off than most of the other people.

3173
02:53:47.500 --> 02:53:52.500
<v 1>But is there more energy and say like a piece of elk than there is in line</v>

3174
02:53:52.511 --> 02:53:56.890
caught salmon?
Is there more energy and grass fed beef than there is in lamp?

3175
02:53:57.240 --> 02:53:59.880
<v 2>Is that quantifiable?
I don't believe so.</v>

3176
02:53:59.881 --> 02:54:04.881
And what we do is we eat as much of it in moderation as we can.

3177
02:54:05.431 --> 02:54:10.020
So I want the elk,
I want the salmon,
I want the lamb,
I want the chicken,

3178
02:54:10.021 --> 02:54:12.540
I want the Turkey,
I want all of it.

3179
02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:15.520
I don't want to have just the beef everyday and just the eggs every everyday

3180
02:54:15.780 --> 02:54:16.410
mixing it up.

3181
02:54:16.410 --> 02:54:20.460
You have to mix everything because each one has a different nutrient profile and

3182
02:54:20.461 --> 02:54:23.550
I want all of them.
No,
those nutrients to cycle through my body.

3183
02:54:23.580 --> 02:54:27.170
Not just one type because you can build up some sort of allergy,
um,

3184
02:54:27.720 --> 02:54:30.240
or you build up at a,
you can be creative deficiency.

3185
02:54:30.450 --> 02:54:33.750
So as much of everything as possible,
whatever's local is best.

3186
02:54:33.930 --> 02:54:37.500
What's ever in season is best because that again has a higher nutrient quantity.

3187
02:54:37.710 --> 02:54:40.140
So whatever's seasonal,
that's what we typically cycle through.

3188
02:54:40.200 --> 02:54:43.980
<v 1>Have you ever had to work with someone like a Jake shields who tries to fight as</v>

3189
02:54:43.981 --> 02:54:46.110
a vegan effect?
He sort of Vegan eats eggs.

3190
02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:49.640
<v 2>Yeah,
I speak with Jake.
We've toyed with it a little bit.</v>

3191
02:54:49.641 --> 02:54:51.020
Never worked together officially.

3192
02:54:51.450 --> 02:54:55.760
Do I work with any specific vegans?
No,
I do.
I mean,

3193
02:54:55.790 --> 02:54:59.030
not professional athletes,
but in you know,
our normal business that we do,

3194
02:54:59.031 --> 02:55:00.560
we have some vegans and that's pretty easy.

3195
02:55:00.561 --> 02:55:04.010
A lot of my recipes are Vegan centric,
um,
which is

3196
02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:07.460
<v 3>easy to do.
But if you're a combat athlete,
it's really hard to excel.</v>

3197
02:55:07.490 --> 02:55:10.310
It's possible if you're an outlier,
but it's very possible,

3198
02:55:10.311 --> 02:55:14.930
very hard to excel without that animal protein.
And most vegans agree with that.

3199
02:55:14.960 --> 02:55:19.960
It's very difficult unless you're dogmatic about your sourcing of nutrition,

3200
02:55:20.330 --> 02:55:24.530
it becomes a full time plus job in order to eat the right foods at the right

3201
02:55:24.531 --> 02:55:27.680
time and you'd have to go to the market and you always have to have that supply.

3202
02:55:27.860 --> 02:55:30.500
You can't miss meals because you,
Bonnie's is constantly breaking down.

3203
02:55:31.150 --> 02:55:35.450
And is it harder for them also to get a high enough calories from their proteins

3204
02:55:35.451 --> 02:55:37.430
and things like a little bit,
it's harder for them to get,

3205
02:55:37.480 --> 02:55:39.380
they have to have what's called complimentary proteins.

3206
02:55:39.381 --> 02:55:42.960
You have to get multiple nutrient sources in order to get all the,

3207
02:55:42.990 --> 02:55:47.690
the amino acids like pea protein and hemp protein and rice protein and all these

3208
02:55:47.691 --> 02:55:49.520
different,
exactly.
Souders and stuff.

3209
02:55:50.360 --> 02:55:54.140
So vegan need a very diverse diet in order to make sure they're getting all the

3210
02:55:54.141 --> 02:55:56.750
proper nutrients and just becomes a lot of work.

3211
02:55:56.751 --> 02:56:01.130
And Jake has said that it's just a lot of work.
And even then,
is it,
is it,

3212
02:56:01.370 --> 02:56:06.370
is it 100% what you would get if you were eating elk and steak and chicken?

3213
02:56:06.931 --> 02:56:09.950
And,
I don't believe so.
I think it's,
I personally,

3214
02:56:09.951 --> 02:56:11.330
and I've never lived at 12 month.

3215
02:56:11.331 --> 02:56:15.530
I've lived for three months as a Vegan and it was very difficult.
I leaned out,

3216
02:56:15.531 --> 02:56:19.460
I lost a lot of weight,
I lost a lot of power output.
My endurance went up.

3217
02:56:19.490 --> 02:56:23.900
I mean my,
my blood panel looked awesome,
so it was definitely a give and take.
Um,

3218
02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:26.060
I didn't do it for a full 12 months,
which I think would,

3219
02:56:26.210 --> 02:56:29.450
I would really have to go through all four seasons to truly understand and feel

3220
02:56:29.451 --> 02:56:33.950
it.
Um,
and uh,
you know,
so I know fits,

3221
02:56:33.951 --> 02:56:36.470
tried it for awhile,
but then he went back to meet.

3222
02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:39.450
He said he feels much stronger.
Much better.
Yeah.
You know,

3223
02:56:39.451 --> 02:56:42.830
there's so many vegans were like tweeting Fitch.
They were loving it,

3224
02:56:42.860 --> 02:56:46.130
that he was Vegan.
Like,
we love that you're a Vegan man.
It's amazing.

3225
02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:51.050
And then afterwards he's like,
fuck,
this sucked it hard.
Tell us,
wait,

3226
02:56:51.051 --> 02:56:54.230
I'm not as strong.
I'm not as a grant.
I don't have as much energy.
And it goes,

3227
02:56:54.231 --> 02:56:56.780
and now I feel much better now that I'm eating meat again.
And they're like,

3228
02:56:58.300 --> 02:57:01.860
sad face,
let's get bummed out.
If you're not a vegan anymore,
they get bought.

3229
02:57:01.870 --> 02:57:04.190
They,
when they lose one of the heirs,
they get fucking,

3230
02:57:04.191 --> 02:57:07.340
but they love when they get one.
But when they lose one man,
it hits them hard.

3231
02:57:07.370 --> 02:57:08.990
It's tough.
It's tough.

3232
02:57:08.990 --> 02:57:13.990
And I do believe that there's a life force also that comes from certain foods.

3233
02:57:14.901 --> 02:57:17.540
I do believe that,
and maybe it's a placebo,
if that's true,

3234
02:57:17.620 --> 02:57:21.530
that I think I've had this philosophy,
which total bro Science on my part,

3235
02:57:21.860 --> 02:57:25.250
but my philosophy is that things that run quicker or better for you,

3236
02:57:25.650 --> 02:57:27.980
because that's why there's a reward for getting them.

3237
02:57:28.080 --> 02:57:31.190
And that's why before people figured out nets and hooks and lines,

3238
02:57:31.191 --> 02:57:34.820
it's really hard to catch a fish.
And if you kind of fish fucking strong protein,

3239
02:57:34.821 --> 02:57:36.560
you catch a salmon.
It's very high in protein.

3240
02:57:36.561 --> 02:57:38.420
Hemp I printing eline essential fats.

3241
02:57:38.520 --> 02:57:43.520
I mean a piece of elk has less cholesterol and more protein in the same piece of

3242
02:57:44.181 --> 02:57:48.620
chicken that weighs the same amount that you can easily enough.
Yeah.
Yeah,

3243
02:57:48.650 --> 02:57:53.570
I agree with that.
And Bro Science,
absolutely.
But you know,

3244
02:57:53.571 --> 02:57:55.760
until science cheat the best shit for you.

3245
02:57:55.761 --> 02:58:00.410
Maybe we should start eating Cheetos today.
Maybe.
Well,

3246
02:58:00.411 --> 02:58:01.890
I know they'd eat mountain lion

3247
02:58:02.100 --> 02:58:02.671
<v 1>mountain line.</v>

3248
02:58:02.671 --> 02:58:05.910
Everybody thinks they're like hunters that kill mountain lions are assholes.

3249
02:58:06.240 --> 02:58:08.550
But first of all,
you need to control the mountain lion population.

3250
02:58:08.551 --> 02:58:11.630
Otherwise they kill all the deer.
They kill all the pigs,
they kill everything.

3251
02:58:11.650 --> 02:58:14.250
Mountain lions are motherfuckers,
but also people eat it.

3252
02:58:14.400 --> 02:58:16.980
They eat mountain lions supposed to be really delicious and never had it.

3253
02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:20.240
Never had it either.
Is that a Colorado thing?
No,
it's,
you know,

3254
02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:23.940
places like Colorado for sure.
Utah places where they hunted on a regular basis,

3255
02:58:23.941 --> 02:58:26.070
they choose a mountain lion,
um,

3256
02:58:26.071 --> 02:58:28.830
over a pig and a lot of places they really like it.
Yeah,

3257
02:58:28.831 --> 02:58:30.450
it's supposed to like the backstraps.

3258
02:58:30.480 --> 02:58:34.560
The loin from outlines supposed to be delicious.
We ran out of time.
My friend,

3259
02:58:34.590 --> 02:58:37.230
if people want to get ahold of you,
how do they get ahold of you on Twitter?

3260
02:58:37.290 --> 02:58:41.610
That's the dolce diet.com.
The dolce died on Twitter and Facebook and all the,

3261
02:58:41.611 --> 02:58:43.270
all the places that you don't want to then use that.

3262
02:58:43.340 --> 02:58:46.230
Your book that you have there.
That is,
that is for you my friend.

3263
02:58:46.231 --> 02:58:48.770
It's three weeks to shred it or a new book that's out right now.
It's,

3264
02:58:48.780 --> 02:58:52.320
it details the Tiago out of his weight cut and also the one I had done previous.

3265
02:58:52.321 --> 02:58:54.360
So it's the original in the expanded version.
Dude,

3266
02:58:54.361 --> 02:58:56.690
we could do about 15 more of these I'm sure.

3267
02:58:56.691 --> 02:59:01.691
And when more things come up and more issues nutritionally or exercise wise or

3268
02:59:01.890 --> 02:59:04.800
let's do it.
Absolutely.
Thank you very much my friend.
Really appreciate it.
