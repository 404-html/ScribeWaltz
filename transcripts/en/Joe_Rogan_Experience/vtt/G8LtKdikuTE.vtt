49
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Naturebox is my newest addiction around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the office and a lot of people on my</v>

50
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:29.850
<v Speaker 1>message board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had questions about exactly how</v>

51
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 1>healthy it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

52
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:35.060
<v Speaker 1>you can vary it at naturebox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be like a real freak and go,</v>

53
00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gluten free route,</v>

54
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 1>which is how I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can get a little sketchy with</v>

55
00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:41.400
<v Speaker 1>shit like pretzels.</v>

56
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only you can only make pretzels so</v>

57
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:46.730
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's really not a lot you could do to</v>

58
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>them that makes them actually healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretzels are fucking pretzels man.</v>

59
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>But what naturebox do have products are</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural and contained a much higher</v>

60
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:58.260
<v Speaker 1>quality ingredients than the typical</v>
<v Speaker 1>vending machine.</v>

61
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Food ingredients there is over 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>snacks.</v>

62
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Choose from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look for something with</v>

63
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>certain dietary needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like wheat free,</v>

64
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>lower sugar content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. They have that too.</v>

65
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>And whenever possible They try to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>non gmo food as well.</v>

66
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Their products are made from wholesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredients.</v>

67
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>And nutritionist approve the abide by</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strict quality standards,</v>

68
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>no high fructose corn syrup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no pipe,</v>

69
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>partially hydrogenated oils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no trans fats,</v>

70
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>no artificial sweeteners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no artificial colors,</v>

71
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>no artificial flavors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's wAy healthier than most bullshit</v>

72
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>that you're getting from vending</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines.</v>

73
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea behind it.</v>

74
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.330
<v Speaker 1>And again you can get it is variable is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fairly healthy pretzels or what my</v>

137
00:06:51.761 --> 00:06:55.240
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with coffee that can bring me</v>
<v Speaker 1>some coffee that smells like lemons.</v>

00:06:55.241 --> 00:06:58.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm here for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this stuff that you brought?</v>

139
00:06:58.091 --> 00:07:01.540
<v Speaker 1>You brought this ethiopian blend that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was warm when we got it.</v>

140
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

141
00:07:02.831 --> 00:07:03.664
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

142
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.480
<v Speaker 3>I brought you ethiopian coffee because</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

143
00:07:07.481 --> 00:07:09.070
<v Speaker 3>At some point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm a coffee guy,</v>

144
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:11.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been working in coffee for years,</v>

145
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.260
<v Speaker 3>25 years or more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you're a coffee guy,</v>

146
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.120
<v Speaker 3>everybody asks you their coffee</v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

147
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.360
<v Speaker 3>And the number one question that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>start asking you is,</v>

148
00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:20.740
<v Speaker 3>what's your favorite coffee?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

149
00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:24.670
<v Speaker 3>everybody wants to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now most coffee people,</v>

150
00:07:24.671 --> 00:07:26.980
<v Speaker 3>when they're asked that question a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>

151
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.900
<v Speaker 3>the way I lied was I would say a that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like asking a parent who their favorite</v>

152
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.010
<v Speaker 3>child is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

153
00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:34.030
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not allowed</v>

154
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.290

<v Speaker 3>You got a coffee problem.</v>

155
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.100
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

156
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got allowed to do that.</v>

157
00:07:39.401 --> 00:07:40.540
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to do that.</v>

158
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:42.220
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to play favorites,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

159
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.640
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

160
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.290
<v Speaker 3>putting that lie aside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most coffee people are affectionate</v>

161
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:51.130
<v Speaker 3>about coffee from Ethiopia because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where coffees from originates.</v>

162
00:07:51.131 --> 00:07:51.880
<v Speaker 3>It originates.</v>

163
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be beautiful shit out.</v>

164
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.360
<v Speaker 1>It smells so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

165
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.670
<v Speaker 1>what is the name of this particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>blend that you made?</v>

166
00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

167
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.300
<v Speaker 3>called yirgacheffe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're a chef is the name of a town</v>

168
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.360
<v Speaker 3>in southern Ethiopia and it is in coffee</v>
<v Speaker 3>to coffee people.</v>

169
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 3>You're a chef.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is like a mecca.</v>

170
00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:11.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the spot.</v>

171
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.700
<v Speaker 3>This smells unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what.</v>

172
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:15.890
<v Speaker 3>And that's why it it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's uh,</v>

173
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:21.280
<v Speaker 3>it's so famous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The coffee smells like flowers and um,</v>

174
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.600
<v Speaker 3>and then like lemons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like lemon oil or something.</v>

175
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:26.600
<v Speaker 3>And that's really unique if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you taste coffee that tastes,</v>

176
00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 3>smells and case like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost certain that it comes from</v>

177
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:35.750
<v Speaker 3>Ethiopia because because of the variety</v>
<v Speaker 3>they grow there because the way that</v>

178
00:08:35.751 --> 00:08:38.150
<v Speaker 3>they process it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc. It makes it really special.</v>

179
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.730
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

180
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.210
<v Speaker 3>this was roasted by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by company in san francisco called</v>

181
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:48.230
<v Speaker 3>wrecking ball coffee and the coffee is</v>
<v Speaker 3>called Ethiopia classic yirgacheffe</v>

182

<v Speaker 3>classic meaning shove again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why I g m,</v>

183
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.250

<v Speaker 4>c h e f,</v>

186
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 4>f e isn't a weird thing where you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to write it down to look at it to make</v>

187
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:07.040
<v Speaker 4>sure it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

188
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.840
<v Speaker 4>the other weird thing too is that that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>one way to spell it.</v>

189
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 4>There's like if you're in yoga chef and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at signs,</v>

190
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.280
<v Speaker 4>they're all spelled a different way</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's actually an mri tech.</v>

191
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 4>It's a different language and they just</v>
<v Speaker 4>translate it to english and various</v>

192
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:21.240
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can spell it.</v>

193
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.490
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been in involved in internet.</v>

194
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's another coffee geek admission.</v>

195
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.890
<v Speaker 4>I've been involved in these internet</v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations about how you should spell</v>

196
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:31.470
<v Speaker 4>yoga show also how you should pronounce</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

197
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.130
<v Speaker 4>but in in ethiopian they pronounce it</v>
<v Speaker 4>differently in a way that I can't</v>

198
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:37.980
<v Speaker 4>actually pronounce it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do they say give it a shot or a gut</v>

199
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.750
<v Speaker 4>check or good chef.</v>

200
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.801
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

201
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:43.020
<v Speaker 4>The last thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a breathing,</v>

202
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.110
<v Speaker 4>but you just did it when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how we get to do it.</v>

203
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 4>There was an ethiopian guy next to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

204
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.150
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like,</v>

205
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like saying I've just been to roma or</v>

206
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:54.570
<v Speaker 4>something like that is a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have my friend amber lyon who's coming</v>

207
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:57.460
<v Speaker 4>on the podcast soon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was talking about boxing.</v>

208
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

209
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.760
<v Speaker 4>Instead of Bahrain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is almost,</v>

210
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.100
<v Speaker 4>she was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then she,</v>

211
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.590
<v Speaker 4>she let it go and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by rain,</v>

212
00:10:03.591 --> 00:10:04.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

213
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.910
<v Speaker 4>I got to be one or the other here in</v>
<v Speaker 4>southern California in the newscasters</v>

214
00:10:07.911 --> 00:10:10.860
<v Speaker 4>suddenly just goes into the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 4>spanish pronunciation.</v>

215
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.073
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

216
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.530
<v Speaker 4>Burrito.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

217
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.180
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's very important.</v>

218
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.770
<v Speaker 4>If you want to maintain the latin</v>
<v Speaker 4>audience,</v>

219
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.450
<v Speaker 4>you gotta roll your r's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

220
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't try for that with coffee names</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's a little too low.</v>

221
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.460
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're taking a chance on being like</v>

222
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:27.000
<v Speaker 4>already like kind of labeled as a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 4>coffee person.</v>

223
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.270
<v Speaker 4>But if you could pronounce all the words</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the pretentiousness level.</v>

224
00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 4>It gets very risky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

225
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:32.281
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

226
00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:34.140
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing with being a coffee</v>
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>

227
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:36.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because people are afraid that you're</v>

228
00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:38.280
<v Speaker 4>going to be like a kind of a douchebag</v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

229
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.560
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about your coffee,</v>

230
00:10:40.561 --> 00:10:41.394
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because.</v>

231
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:46.500
<v Speaker 4>Because it's a weird conundrum because</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the one hand people like that you</v>

232
00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:48.930
<v Speaker 4>take it seriously and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and because you're trying to,</v>

233
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.850
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

234
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:56.180
<v Speaker 4>embrace something that's super delicious</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you want it to be more delicious and</v>

235
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.960
<v Speaker 4>better tasting and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that causes you to learn stuff</v>

236
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:04.800
<v Speaker 4>about the geography of where coffee</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes from and all this weird trivia,</v>

237
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.323
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

238
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.223
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

239
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.390
<v Speaker 4>you start to learn about that stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's good.</v>

240
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.270
<v Speaker 4>But at the Same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very easy when you get really into</v>

241
00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:14.580
<v Speaker 4>something to start to alienate people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

242
00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:18.750
<v Speaker 4>and that goes for anything that goes for</v>
<v Speaker 4>wine or food or you know,</v>

243
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.330
<v Speaker 4>any sort of hobby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

244
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:26.760
<v Speaker 4>when people can't talk about anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>else and then they start to get kind of</v>

245
00:11:26.761 --> 00:11:28.970
<v Speaker 4>snobby about stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>

246
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.620
<v Speaker 4>And so it's a struggle for coffee people</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time,</v>

247
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:35.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because what I know and I've learned in</v>

248
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:37.740
<v Speaker 4>my many years of doing this thing is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

249
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.720
<v Speaker 4>especially in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

250
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.900
<v Speaker 4>people just want their coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to fuck around with,</v>

251
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.850
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know all this,</v>

252
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.730
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we learned that in,</v>

253
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:47.610
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

254
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.580
<v Speaker 4>So I started as a barista.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worked for many,</v>

255
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:53.470
<v Speaker 4>many years as a barista behind the car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>behind the bar,</v>

256
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.060
<v Speaker 4>making people their coffee in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>morning.</v>

257
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.720
<v Speaker 4>so do you really appreciate like when</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's a connoisseur,</v>

258
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.790
<v Speaker 4>like the difference between the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I just want a cup of coffee and a</v>

259
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:02.580
<v Speaker 4>guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's your blends today?</v>

260
00:12:02.581 --> 00:12:05.410
<v Speaker 4>A guy like who's really into it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lots of times it's the same person,</v>

261
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:10.590
<v Speaker 4>like a person that later in the day will</v>
<v Speaker 4>be like all into what kind of coffee it</v>

262
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:15.010
<v Speaker 4>is and really particular everybody just</v>
<v Speaker 4>their first cup of coffee,</v>

263
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 4>they just want a freaking cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even even coffee pros like me,</v>

264
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we dispense with all that stuff that,</v>

265
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Speaker 4>that time when you know you've been</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

266
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.730
<v Speaker 4>you wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what's going on.</v>

267
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.970
<v Speaker 4>All you want is a cup of coffee and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people to be nice to you for the first</v>

268
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.910
<v Speaker 4>couple of hours of your day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Usually most of the time when I don't</v>

269
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:37.120
<v Speaker 4>have any time and I just want some sort</v>
<v Speaker 4>of caffeine,</v>

270
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.060
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have one of those little suppress</v>

271
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:39.993
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

272
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.850
<v Speaker 4>Will you put those little capsules in</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and you catch it down,</v>

273
00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.910
<v Speaker 4>you press the button and a shot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>espresso comes out.</v>

274
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are those bad?</v>

275
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.480
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't taste as good as the real.</v>

276
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.450
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're convenient,</v>

277
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

278
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:58.650
<v Speaker 4>and whether they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of disadvantages to a,</v>

279
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.900
<v Speaker 4>to a thing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On the other hand,</v>

280
00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:04.870
<v Speaker 4>I've tasted delicious coffee out of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of those real.</v>

281
00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:08.950
<v Speaker 4>If the coffee going in is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is good if the machine is working right?</v>

282
00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:11.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's all sorts of different</v>
<v Speaker 4>kinds of machines.</v>

283
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:15.220
<v Speaker 4>WhaT is the expect you to know this</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you don't manufacture these</v>

284
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:16.180
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what is the.</v>

285
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 4>Is there plastic right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>

286
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.280
<v Speaker 4>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some out of aluminum.</v>

287
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.840
<v Speaker 4>Others that are made out of plastic?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

288
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the ones I have are aluminum.</v>

289
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.060
<v Speaker 4>So is that stuff okay for the flavor</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're heating that up,</v>

290
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.070
<v Speaker 4>eating up the illumina.</v>

291
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:29.980
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mess it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

292
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 4>That's not the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem that's aluminum is pretty</v>

293
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.020
<v Speaker 4>resistant to stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they make that metal work,</v>

294
00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:39.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a soda pop cans so they have</v>

295
00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.910
<v Speaker 4>an engineered it to work well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not an issue with flavor,</v>

296
00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:46.030
<v Speaker 4>it's just an issue of what's in it will</v>
<v Speaker 4>rise and also how the,</v>

297
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.930
<v Speaker 4>how the machine works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if like you guys made coffee here</v>

298
00:13:49.931 --> 00:13:54.931
<v Speaker 4>today and you did it in a great way by</v>
<v Speaker 4>boiling the water in a kettle and then</v>

299
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.770
<v Speaker 4>you have a french press and use it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

300
00:13:56.771 --> 00:14:00.220
<v Speaker 4>the great thing about that is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're boiling the water.</v>

301
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.310
<v Speaker 4>The water is getting to 212.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where it boils.</v>

302
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.680
<v Speaker 4>And then by the time you pour it in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>french press,</v>

303
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.810
<v Speaker 4>it's cooled off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's 200,</v>

304
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:08.980
<v Speaker 4>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>205.</v>

305
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:13.600
<v Speaker 4>Is that where you should have it at 195</v>
<v Speaker 4>to 205 degrees is where you should be.</v>

306
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.490
<v Speaker 4>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

307
00:14:15.491 --> 00:14:17.310
<v Speaker 4>I know he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got so intense,</v>

308
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.950
<v Speaker 4>195 to 200,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five degrees and sunny spot.</v>

309
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:22.120
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the honey spot.</v>

310
00:14:22.121 --> 00:14:25.000
<v Speaker 4>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where we get guys like me get</v>

311
00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:27.580
<v Speaker 4>fired up over stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we bought today's the first day of</v>

312
00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:29.560
<v Speaker 4>using it here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I have at home,</v>

313
00:14:29.561 --> 00:14:33.390
<v Speaker 4>which is I think it's called breville b</v>
<v Speaker 4>r e v I l l e and it's uh,</v>

314
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.460
<v Speaker 4>it'll show you like you could have one</v>
<v Speaker 4>button for oolong tea.</v>

315
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:39.830
<v Speaker 4>the other button for french press and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was the french press button.</v>

316
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.480
<v Speaker 4>So I assume they get it right then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's even better than what it did.</v>

317
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.880
<v Speaker 4>And this is breville.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They make some wonderful,</v>

318
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.310
<v Speaker 4>incredible coffee equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

319
00:14:48.311 --> 00:14:49.840
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

320
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:55.200
<v Speaker 4>and so the french press button will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure get it to 205 degrees.</v>

321
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.520
<v Speaker 4>We should put a thermometer in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>

322
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.730
<v Speaker 4>Find out whether or not I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find out we need a thermometer.</v>

323
00:15:01.731 --> 00:15:03.320
<v Speaker 4>Just me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's very important.</v>

324
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.170
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's the thing guys like me,</v>

325
00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:08.540
<v Speaker 4>we have thermometers at home because we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes a difference.</v>

326
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.470
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

327
00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.740
<v Speaker 4>but check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I believe what I was going to say is</v>

328
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.920
<v Speaker 4>the machines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a pod machine or a capsule</v>

329
00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:19.640
<v Speaker 4>machine like you're talking about or a</v>
<v Speaker 4>mr coffee type machine,</v>

330
00:15:19.641 --> 00:15:20.451
<v Speaker 4>black and decker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

331
00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:24.110
<v Speaker 4>all those kinds of coffee machines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the big challenges with those</v>

332
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:27.380
<v Speaker 4>things as if they don't get hot enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they're brewing coffee at 180</v>

333
00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:29.090
<v Speaker 4>degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to taste like crap.</v>

334
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.570
<v Speaker 4>And so you're cooking it while you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>brewing it.</v>

335
00:15:32.571 --> 00:15:33.231
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

336
00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:34.910
<v Speaker 4>So the water is hot,</v>

337
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some amount of hot and if it's,</v>

338
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.090
<v Speaker 3>and if it's the right amount of hot in</v>
<v Speaker 3>between one and 95 and 205,</v>

339
00:15:42.091 --> 00:15:45.630
<v Speaker 3>right about 200 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it makes the coffee taste.</v>

340
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.030
<v Speaker 4>So it actually literally changes the</v>
<v Speaker 4>flavor that's coming out of the beans</v>

341
00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:51.310
<v Speaker 4>when it's hot enough to activate it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

342
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.530
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and too hot is bad,</v>

343
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.090
<v Speaker 4>too hot is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so here's,</v>

344
00:15:55.091 --> 00:15:57.370
<v Speaker 4>here's the deal with coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you looked at it under a</v>

345
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:58.503
<v Speaker 4>microscope,</v>

346
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:01.670
<v Speaker 3>took a slice of it and then looked at</v>
<v Speaker 3>that under a microscope,</v>

347
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.510
<v Speaker 3>you'd see all the cellular structure of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coffee and it's like a sponge.</v>

348
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:11.510
<v Speaker 3>And inside the sponge is all the oils</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sugars and fats and stuff that may</v>

349
00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:18.920
<v Speaker 3>really complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's thousands of little different</v>

350
00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:21.560
<v Speaker 3>chemicals in there that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

351
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.400
<v Speaker 3>that you need to get out of the sponge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to essentially rinse it out of</v>

352
00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:28.610
<v Speaker 3>the coffee to get it into your cup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what brewing is all about.</v>

353
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.330
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

354
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:35.210
<v Speaker 3>if you don't do that well enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you leave all the good tasting stuff in</v>

355
00:16:35.211 --> 00:16:39.500
<v Speaker 3>the coffee that sponge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coffee cell walls,</v>

356
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't get into your cup and</v>

357
00:16:41.721 --> 00:16:43.880
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your coffee doesn't taste very good</v>

358
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.670
<v Speaker 3>and plus you've wasted all the good</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

359
00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:49.910
<v Speaker 3>You wind up throwing it in the trash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the opposite thing happens,</v>

360
00:16:49.911 --> 00:16:52.580
<v Speaker 3>if you extract too much out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>

361
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.640
<v Speaker 3>if you squeeze that sponge till it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly dry,</v>

362
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.720
<v Speaker 3>then the last stuff to get extracted</v>
<v Speaker 3>tastes kind of bitter.</v>

363
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.130
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like tannic,</v>

364
00:17:04.131 --> 00:17:04.964
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>

365
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:08.750
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't taste good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has a characteristic that we call</v>

366
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.650
<v Speaker 3>over extracted.</v>

367
00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:14.080
<v Speaker 4>And so that bitter tannin comes from a</v>
<v Speaker 4>prolonged exposure to hot water.</v>

368
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:16.030
<v Speaker 4>Either the water being too hot</v>

369
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:21.360
<v Speaker 3>or you bring it for too long or a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or like for example,</v>

370
00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:25.360
<v Speaker 3>if you boiled coffee like they used to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do in the cowboy days,</v>

371
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.710
<v Speaker 3>he used to like boil coffee over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>campfire that will make the coffee taste</v>

372
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.860
<v Speaker 4>bitter and accurate and offline because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's over extracted.</v>

373
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.920
<v Speaker 4>And that over extraction is what creates</v>
<v Speaker 4>tannins.</v>

374
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.000
<v Speaker 4>A,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

375
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not tan and specifically,</v>

376
00:17:37.411 --> 00:17:39.390
<v Speaker 4>but those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that tannic sort of flavor,</v>

377
00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.510
<v Speaker 4>it's makes us stringency,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flavor,</v>

378
00:17:41.511 --> 00:17:44.280
<v Speaker 4>taste in your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that bitterness is from the heat</v>

379
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.040
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

380
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.870
<v Speaker 4>it's extracting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>extracting bad tasting stuff out of the.</v>

381
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.430
<v Speaker 4>So it extracts</v>

382
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.590
<v Speaker 1>all the good tasting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's an additional</v>

383
00:17:52.591 --> 00:17:54.690
<v Speaker 1>extraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad tasting stuff too.</v>

384
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:55.883
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

385
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.870
<v Speaker 1>So you want to get the stuff that's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>loose.</v>

386
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.120
<v Speaker 1>there's like a ripe fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

387
00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.530
<v Speaker 3>it's like right in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this sweet spot.</v>

388
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:06.250
<v Speaker 3>And so this organization that I worked</v>
<v Speaker 3>for called the specialty coffee</v>

389
00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:08.440
<v Speaker 3>association,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we in the 19 fifties,</v>

390
00:18:08.441 --> 00:18:12.760
<v Speaker 3>they started to do some science about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and how to brew coffee properly and</v>

391
00:18:12.761 --> 00:18:17.410
<v Speaker 3>get the coffee to our tasted best to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people and they had thousands of</v>

392
00:18:17.411 --> 00:18:20.250
<v Speaker 3>people tasting different coffees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

393
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:25.320
<v Speaker 3>and they determined what the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 3>extraction of a cup of coffee was to</v>

394
00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.240
<v Speaker 3>most people in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>

395
00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.200
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we,</v>

396
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:35.500
<v Speaker 3>then they designed a amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>extraction.</v>

397
00:18:35.501 --> 00:18:37.420
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to get technical on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

398
00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.360
<v Speaker 3>So 100 night I already told you 195 to</v>
<v Speaker 3>200.</v>

399
00:18:40.361 --> 00:18:44.500
<v Speaker 3>Five is the right temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the extraction that you want to get is</v>

400
00:18:44.501 --> 00:18:49.501
<v Speaker 3>between 18 and 22 percent extraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this is coffee geek stuff that</v>

401
00:18:50.081 --> 00:18:52.450
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is the kind of stuff that we</v>

402
00:18:52.451 --> 00:18:53.320
<v Speaker 3>talk to each other about.</v>

403
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.910
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

404
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.250
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

405
00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:00.010
<v Speaker 3>and so like good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a favorite coffee place</v>

406
00:19:00.011 --> 00:19:02.260
<v Speaker 3>where the baristas are like really good</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they make the coffee taste really</v>

407
00:19:02.261 --> 00:19:04.270
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chances are they know about that</v>

408
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:09.990
<v Speaker 3>extraction window and they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the coffee within that extraction</v>

409
00:19:10.151 --> 00:19:13.090
<v Speaker 3>window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it tastes great if you exceed 22</v>

410
00:19:13.091 --> 00:19:14.560
<v Speaker 3>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

411
00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.430
<v Speaker 3>and something closer to 30 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coffee is actually extractable,</v>

412
00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:22.030
<v Speaker 3>you could get 30 percent of the material</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the coffee if you want it,</v>

413
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:27.510
<v Speaker 3>if you totally squeezed the sponge dry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but 18 to 22 percent is where it tastes</v>

414
00:19:27.521 --> 00:19:28.354
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

415
00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.780
<v Speaker 1>WOw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

416
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.230
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you jumped at the chance to pour</v>

417
00:19:33.231 --> 00:19:36.050
<v Speaker 1>this coffee and to brew this coffee or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

418
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.770
<v Speaker 1>you didn't want us fucking it up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

419
00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:38.480
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

420
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.630
<v Speaker 1>it's true with good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither jamie nor I know what the fuck</v>

421
00:19:41.631 --> 00:19:42.030
<v Speaker 1>we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was like,</v>

422
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.160
<v Speaker 1>he knows what he's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dive,</v>

423
00:19:43.161 --> 00:19:43.941
<v Speaker 1>I doubt it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust me,</v>

424
00:19:43.941 --> 00:19:47.690
<v Speaker 1>he learned everything from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know a little bit,</v>

425
00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.600
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

426
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:53.680
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to these sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like times of extraction and</v>

427
00:19:54.711 --> 00:19:57.530
<v Speaker 1>temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it vary depending on what kind of</v>

428
00:19:57.531 --> 00:19:58.320
<v Speaker 1>coffee you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

429
00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.730
<v Speaker 1>so this is the ethiopian coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you have a different if it was a</v>

430
00:20:01.731 --> 00:20:02.564
<v Speaker 1>jamaican?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

431
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:03.760
<v Speaker 3>IT absolutely does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

432
00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.370
<v Speaker 3>and so when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

433
00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.990
<v Speaker 3>when coffee pros sort of start to work</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a coffee,</v>

434
00:20:10.991 --> 00:20:14.230
<v Speaker 3>we'll experiment with different</v>
<v Speaker 3>temperatures,</v>

435
00:20:14.231 --> 00:20:18.260
<v Speaker 3>different kinds of extraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different coarseness of grind to try to,</v>

436
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.860
<v Speaker 3>to try to get it right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find the sweet spot.</v>

437
00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We call it dialing it in.</v>

438
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.570
<v Speaker 3>So if we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

439
00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.580
<v Speaker 3>if a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a,</v>

440
00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.890
<v Speaker 3>if you're with a group of coffee people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a new coffee,</v>

441
00:20:29.891 --> 00:20:31.540
<v Speaker 3>you'll ask somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you dial it in?</v>

442
00:20:31.541 --> 00:20:35.350
<v Speaker 3>And that means that means did you get it</v>
<v Speaker 3>tasting the way it should be tasting?</v>

443
00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:36.060
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

444
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.010
<v Speaker 1>So what are the variables?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

445
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much is the spectrum of variance</v>

446
00:20:40.621 --> 00:20:43.970
<v Speaker 1>between say what's like an extreme given</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme on each end of,</v>

447
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.920
<v Speaker 1>of what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of like brew times temperatures,</v>

448
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference?</v>

449
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So every.</v>

450
00:20:51.161 --> 00:20:52.330
<v Speaker 3>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>FIrst of all,</v>

451
00:20:52.331 --> 00:20:54.400
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of different types.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marley's yeah.</v>

452
00:20:54.401 --> 00:20:55.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stuff's delicious.</v>

453
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

454
00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

455
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna have a little more to smell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really unique.</v>

456
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really beautiful.</v>

457
00:21:04.361 --> 00:21:05.320
<v Speaker 3>Clean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clean,</v>

458
00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:06.670
<v Speaker 3>floral coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

459
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:09.130
<v Speaker 3>It's so different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We usually have this a hawaiian stuff</v>

460
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:09.920
<v Speaker 3>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

461
00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.400
<v Speaker 3>A Hawaii roasters drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really delicious.</v>

462
00:21:12.401 --> 00:21:13.450
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

463
00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:15.460
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is probably like the polar opposite</v>

464
00:21:15.461 --> 00:21:16.750
<v Speaker 3>of that actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very different.</v>

465
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Smells amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

466
00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:22.600
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about this coffee is</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's super fragrant.</v>

467
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a very unusual way.</v>

468
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't smell like coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like it's almost like tea.</v>

469
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:28.054
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

470
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.210
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would describe this coffee is being t</v>

471
00:21:31.211 --> 00:21:31.841
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

472
00:21:31.841 --> 00:21:33.380
<v Speaker 3>it's really beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

473
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.010
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's all these different ways to</v>

474
00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:38.800
<v Speaker 3>brew coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've got a french press here,</v>

475
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.600
<v Speaker 3>there's a pour over coffee drip coffee</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you,</v>

476
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.160
<v Speaker 3>certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a little vacuum thing.</v>

477
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:46.950
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be talking about an era.</v>

478
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.890
<v Speaker 3>Are those good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

479
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Coffee people love them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and each one of those has a different</v>

480
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.870
<v Speaker 3>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like in this french press,</v>

481
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.860
<v Speaker 3>coffee will steep for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like tea and then you press it</v>

482
00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:02.440
<v Speaker 3>down and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how long do you usually steep it?</v>

483
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.140
<v Speaker 3>four to six minutes is kind of a window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

484
00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know how does something like a clover</v>

485
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:07.930
<v Speaker 3>work then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the clover,</v>

486
00:22:07.931 --> 00:22:11.620
<v Speaker 3>that crazy computerized coffee machine</v>
<v Speaker 3>that cooked at very quickly,</v>

487
00:22:11.621 --> 00:22:12.401
<v Speaker 3>very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

488
00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:16.870
<v Speaker 3>So the way that that works is it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>designed to be able to have fine,</v>

489
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.470
<v Speaker 3>finer coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

490
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.080
<v Speaker 3>so um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

491
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:25.180
<v Speaker 3>which changes the changes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the extraction surface area,</v>

492
00:22:25.181 --> 00:22:25.601
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

493
00:22:25.601 --> 00:22:28.900
<v Speaker 3>if you grind it really fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it can,</v>

494
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.090
<v Speaker 3>it can brew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can extract really quickly.</v>

495
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.270
<v Speaker 3>so that's why like in an espresso</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine,</v>

496
00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.680
<v Speaker 3>it's ground like to a powder.</v>

497
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Pull thAt video up of the clover</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine,</v>

498
00:22:37.601 --> 00:22:38.890
<v Speaker 1>just so you can see what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

499
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:42.850
<v Speaker 1>For folks who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some genius guys who were coffee nerds.</v>

500
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

501
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.740
<v Speaker 1>no vander nosler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

502
00:22:44.741 --> 00:22:45.574
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a coffee nerd.</v>

503
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm just under fdr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from stanford university,</v>

504
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:55.380
<v Speaker 1>and they figured out this machine which</v>
<v Speaker 1>costs some upwards of $10,000 dollars.</v>

505
00:22:55.691 --> 00:22:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 11,000 bucks and I've never thought</v>

506
00:22:59.291 --> 00:23:03.190
<v Speaker 1>about buying one until I watched someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it and use it,</v>

507
00:23:03.191 --> 00:23:04.150
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

508
00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:05.710
<v Speaker 1>this might be the fucking coolest thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

509
00:23:05.711 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Looked for a real coffee dork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I found out that starbucks</v>

510
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:12.670
<v Speaker 1>bought them all those sons of bitches</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't even see them.</v>

511
00:23:12.671 --> 00:23:14.050
<v Speaker 1>I never see them in a starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

512
00:23:14.051 --> 00:23:15.180
<v Speaker 1>they have them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not that.</v>

513
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starbucks should fucking sell them.</v>

514
00:23:17.861 --> 00:23:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I one of these for the office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell it to you.</v>

515
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.180
<v Speaker 1>If they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be totally willing to buy one of</v>

516
00:23:22.181 --> 00:23:23.670
<v Speaker 1>thoSe and just put it in this office.</v>

517
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.400
<v Speaker 3>I'll see if I can make that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it happened.</v>

518
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.140
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

519
00:23:28.141 --> 00:23:30.090
<v Speaker 3>but I mean I used to have one in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>office,</v>

520
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.360
<v Speaker 1>so this is incredibly variable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing,</v>

521
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.020
<v Speaker 1>if you've never seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this really beautifully constructed,</v>

522
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:41.910
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a giant Piston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a car engine piston and you pour</v>

523
00:23:41.911 --> 00:23:44.850
<v Speaker 1>coffee in it and the water in it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you stir it with like a little</v>

524
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:45.703
<v Speaker 1>whisk</v>

525
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.010
<v Speaker 5>and then dial in the coffee based on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>known recipes for that</v>

526
00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:52.103
<v Speaker 3>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

527
00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.040
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so.</v>

528
00:23:54.041 --> 00:23:56.190
<v Speaker 3>And it was made really fancy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hear it?</v>

529
00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could communicate with other machines</v>

530
00:23:58.781 --> 00:24:00.610
<v Speaker 3>and you could send the recipe from one</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine to another.</v>

531
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.270
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's creepy.</v>

532
00:24:02.271 --> 00:24:03.460
<v Speaker 5>They're going to take over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

533
00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.290
<v Speaker 5>Coffee machine is going to take over and</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the end it's really unusual.</v>

534
00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:11.291
<v Speaker 5>It leaves this hockey hockey puck of</v>
<v Speaker 5>griNds at the top of the machine and</v>

535
00:24:11.511 --> 00:24:15.410
<v Speaker 5>then you have this squeegee which is</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of an elegant way to deal with that</v>

536
00:24:15.411 --> 00:24:18.380
<v Speaker 5>little problem of what do you do with</v>
<v Speaker 5>the coffee grinds and they come off that</v>

537
00:24:18.381 --> 00:24:20.810
<v Speaker 5>piston yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it comes up like a cheeseburger.</v>

538
00:24:20.811 --> 00:24:23.200
<v Speaker 5>It's so weird looking burger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>coffee,</v>

539
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:23.781
<v Speaker 5>break,</v>
<v Speaker 5>coffee,</v>

540
00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:25.460
<v Speaker 5>break out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We call it and then you slide it in with</v>

541
00:24:25.461 --> 00:24:28.560
<v Speaker 5>this little like gas station,</v>
<v Speaker 5>windshield washer,</v>

542
00:24:28.561 --> 00:24:29.660
<v Speaker 5>squeegee thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

543
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:31.130
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking bad ass.</v>

544
00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so on the.</v>

545
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:40.030
<v Speaker 3>So the reason that that can happen so</v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly is because you can use fine</v>

546
00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:44.930
<v Speaker 3>coffee because it's got that hydraulic</v>
<v Speaker 3>piston that sort of pushes it up that's</v>

547
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.220
<v Speaker 3>incredibly strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got these,</v>

548
00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.920
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this metal filter that the coffee</v>

549
00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:54.921
<v Speaker 3>grounds kind of sit on top of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a pressurized situation</v>

550
00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:58.930
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in the same realm as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as uh,</v>

551
00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.070
<v Speaker 3>the aircraft we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>something similar.</v>

552
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.490
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the aero press is essentially a home,</v>

553
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$50 version of that</v>

554
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.210
<v Speaker 5>and it's just as good and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

555
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.520
<v Speaker 5>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck the clover then jesus christ,</v>

556
00:25:13.521 --> 00:25:15.740
<v Speaker 5>we almost,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we just saved ourselves 11 grand or</v>

557
00:25:15.741 --> 00:25:16.574
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

558
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.330
<v Speaker 5>That was really designed for like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>coffee service and bad ass though,</v>

559
00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:23.330
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of that kind of technology.</v>

560
00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:26.990
<v Speaker 5>The fact that they want to support them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were willing to go out and invest</v>

561
00:25:26.991 --> 00:25:28.880
<v Speaker 5>the money to make something like that</v>
<v Speaker 5>and design it.</v>

562
00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.980
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The steam punk,</v>

563
00:25:30.981 --> 00:25:32.730
<v Speaker 3>yet there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

564
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.860
<v Speaker 3>there's all these great coffee machines</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there that pulled out of steam,</v>

565
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:37.550
<v Speaker 3>pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

566
00:25:37.551 --> 00:25:38.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>

567
00:25:38.991 --> 00:25:40.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>recently,</v>

568
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

569
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:47.650
<v Speaker 3>designed machine and it's got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got these glass tubes and bubbles</v>

570
00:25:48.471 --> 00:25:50.330
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this crazy shit.</v>

571
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:50.921
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

572
00:25:50.921 --> 00:25:51.630
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>

573
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.330
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the benefit of that machine?</v>

574
00:25:53.331 --> 00:25:55.320
<v Speaker 3>It's just another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

575
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.290
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually works on a very similar</v>

576
00:25:57.291 --> 00:25:59.690
<v Speaker 3>principle to all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

577
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:05.500
<v Speaker 3>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all coffee machines are designed to make</v>

578
00:26:05.601 --> 00:26:09.110
<v Speaker 3>it easier to do what I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

579
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:09.980
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

580
00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:10.461
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

581
00:26:10.461 --> 00:26:11.750
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the steam punk.</v>

582
00:26:11.751 --> 00:26:14.390
<v Speaker 3>So that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All each of those looks like a pirate</v>

583
00:26:14.391 --> 00:26:15.320
<v Speaker 3>chambers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

584
00:26:15.321 --> 00:26:18.310
<v Speaker 3>Each of those chambers brew coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

585
00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

586
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.020
<v Speaker 3>now interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might get a computer,</v>

587
00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.490
<v Speaker 3>a computer screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

588
00:26:24.491 --> 00:26:25.070
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

589
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.350
<v Speaker 3>And that computer screen is to dial in</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these,</v>

590
00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.510
<v Speaker 3>all these variables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

591
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.880
<v Speaker 3>so recently out of the clover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too much pressure.</v>

592
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.343
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

593
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.430
<v Speaker 5>That's a question that's like asking me</v>
<v Speaker 5>what my favorite child is.</v>

594
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.520
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I probably can't play favorites.</v>

595
00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.500
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's right up there with clover.</v>

596
00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

597
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.500
<v Speaker 3>How much has that been a thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>

598
00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:49.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would guess in the same sort of range,</v>

599
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:52.020
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of these things.</v>

600
00:26:52.021 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going to tell you something</v>
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>

601
00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:55.950
<v Speaker 3>which is these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these machines,</v>

602
00:26:55.951 --> 00:27:00.951
<v Speaker 3>all they do is make it easier to brew</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee like this.</v>

603
00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:04.140
<v Speaker 3>So you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got some pretty sophisticated</v>

604
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.820
<v Speaker 3>equipment in your kitchen and this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>all what he's doing right here.</v>

605
00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.150
<v Speaker 3>This was the right stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

606
00:27:09.151 --> 00:27:10.020
<v Speaker 3>This is wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

607
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:11.490
<v Speaker 3>This makes me feel like a scientist</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

608
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.850
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of laboratories.</v>

609
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.700
<v Speaker 3>It was very mad scientists and so the</v>
<v Speaker 3>water's boiling and one of them and then</v>

610
00:27:17.701 --> 00:27:19.440
<v Speaker 3>the coffees and the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what's going on here?</v>

611
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one in the middle is kind of getting</v>

612
00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:24.830
<v Speaker 3>ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to dump some coffee in there.</v>

613
00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:29.010
<v Speaker 3>He's in the one on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's already extracting the coffee and</v>

614
00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:31.920
<v Speaker 3>these little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those little up pistons are there to</v>

615
00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:35.550
<v Speaker 3>sort of be the filters of the coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a complicated machine.</v>

616
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.620
<v Speaker 3>And I would say so a couple of weeks ago</v>
<v Speaker 3>heRe in los angeles,</v>

617
00:27:40.621 --> 00:27:41.454
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

618
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.690
<v Speaker 3>there was a battle between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

619
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.120
<v Speaker 3>a guy called nick show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nick cho is the,</v>

620
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.950
<v Speaker 3>is the guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's one of the owners of this coffee</v>

621
00:27:49.951 --> 00:27:51.690
<v Speaker 3>company who arrested this coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're drinking,</v>

622
00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.030
<v Speaker 3>and then the inventor of that machine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

623
00:27:55.031 --> 00:27:57.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the steam punk went head to head and had</v>

624
00:27:57.871 --> 00:28:02.871
<v Speaker 3>like a man versus machine kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And nick was just using very simple</v>

625
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.840
<v Speaker 3>little brewer that he poured the water</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

626
00:28:06.841 --> 00:28:10.080
<v Speaker 3>just totally manual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the other guy was,</v>

627
00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:10.973
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

628
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:15.210
<v Speaker 3>was use manning the steam punk and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were like having this head to head where</v>

629
00:28:15.211 --> 00:28:19.080
<v Speaker 3>they each had to brew six different</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffees for these three judges and they</v>

630
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:20.690
<v Speaker 3>couldn't see what they were drinking all</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff.</v>

631
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.920
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now the,</v>

632
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:25.890
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the result was that the steam punk</v>

633
00:28:25.891 --> 00:28:29.670
<v Speaker 3>machine won by a hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was essentially a tie that the,</v>

634
00:28:29.671 --> 00:28:30.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

635
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the point is that you can,</v>

636
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:39.870
<v Speaker 3>you can make coffee delicious by being</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good at mastering the variables,</v>

637
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.620
<v Speaker 3>knowing what your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're knowing what grind looks right,</v>

638
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:45.690
<v Speaker 3>knowing how hot the water is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>

639
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.120
<v Speaker 3>or you can interest that stuff to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>

640
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.390
<v Speaker 3>And that's what machInes do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just get the water right every time</v>

641
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:53.730
<v Speaker 3>they get the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get the,</v>

642
00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:56.550
<v Speaker 3>what we call the turbulence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how much it gets stirred right.</v>

643
00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.250
<v Speaker 3>Every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you can replicate something very</v>

644
00:28:59.251 --> 00:29:02.490
<v Speaker 3>precisely again and again and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coffee is going to be really good.</v>

645
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:03.710
<v Speaker 3>I get a sense</v>

646
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:08.150
<v Speaker 1>though that you're a purist and the you</v>
<v Speaker 1>prefer to use manual equipment.</v>

647
00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Almost like if you drove a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would want a manual gearbox.</v>

648
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:12.543
<v Speaker 1>Are you that guy?</v>

649
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:15.570
<v Speaker 3>I am that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

650
00:29:15.571 --> 00:29:16.770
<v Speaker 3>I told,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told somebody.</v>

651
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.070
<v Speaker 3>Somebody was interviewing me for</v>
<v Speaker 3>something a while ago and I told them I</v>

652
00:29:20.071 --> 00:29:23.940
<v Speaker 3>don't own a coffee machine in my house</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't that I have essentially the</v>

653
00:29:23.941 --> 00:29:28.230
<v Speaker 3>same setup that you have a water boiler</v>
<v Speaker 3>that boils the water for me.</v>

654
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.030
<v Speaker 3>A good grinder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I notice you have a good grinder in</v>

655
00:29:30.031 --> 00:29:31.440
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

656
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.030
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some home style pouring,</v>

657
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use a basically very cheap $30.</v>

658
00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.580
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a friend that I have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>french press.</v>

659
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I usually use paper filter though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because I prefer the flavor.</v>

660
00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

661
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting thing to bring up</v>

662
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.060
<v Speaker 1>because I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of The things that I like about a</v>

663
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:54.540
<v Speaker 1>french press is when you get that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of bubbly surface and then when you pour</v>

664
00:29:54.541 --> 00:29:57.350
<v Speaker 1>it into a mug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get kinda like a little phone like</v>

665
00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.190
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you still get that when you go</v>

666
00:29:59.191 --> 00:30:00.210
<v Speaker 1>through a paper filter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

667
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.640
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what it takes out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems like that's a good thing.</v>

668
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:05.640
<v Speaker 3>It's good thing to you and that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

669
00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.050
<v Speaker 3>you don't like it flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know this.</v>

670
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.400
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're tasting it now.</v>

671
00:30:09.401 --> 00:30:12.070
<v Speaker 3>can you taste in your mouth how you feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there is?</v>

672
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:14.110
<v Speaker 3>You can still taste the coffee a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

673
00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:15.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it'S coating your mouth,</v>

674
00:30:15.431 --> 00:30:17.860
<v Speaker 3>sort of like as if you just drank a</v>
<v Speaker 3>glass of milk or something.</v>

675
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:21.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's called body or after taste and</v>

676
00:30:21.731 --> 00:30:22.850
<v Speaker 3>after taste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

677
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.420
<v Speaker 3>those are technical coffee tasting</v>
<v Speaker 3>terms.</v>

678
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so body is the feeling,</v>

679
00:30:28.631 --> 00:30:32.410
<v Speaker 3>the texture of the coffee in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And aftertaste is the flavor of the</v>

680
00:30:32.411 --> 00:30:34.510
<v Speaker 3>coffee that remains in your mouth once</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gone.</v>

681
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.230
<v Speaker 3>Once it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And aftertaste especially is really</v>

682
00:30:38.231 --> 00:30:40.930
<v Speaker 3>important because you drink coffee in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the morning and you're driving to work.</v>

683
00:30:40.931 --> 00:30:43.390
<v Speaker 3>You still have that flavor of coffee in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mouth.</v>

684
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.760
<v Speaker 3>If that's good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's great.</v>

685
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.580
<v Speaker 3>Then you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get an extra 20 minutes out of your</v>

686
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:50.650
<v Speaker 3>cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's A bonus.</v>

687
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.260
<v Speaker 3>If it's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's bad flavor and you feel like you</v>

688
00:30:53.261 --> 00:30:56.800
<v Speaker 3>need a mint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's like a bad after taste.</v>

689
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:59.800
<v Speaker 3>And so you either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're used to drinking good coffee.</v>

690
00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.040
<v Speaker 3>You like that feeling in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you like that flavor in your mouth?</v>

691
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.780
<v Speaker 3>You like aftertaste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

692
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:09.040
<v Speaker 3>You're brewing coffee the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

693
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:11.740
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just tend to want to move on to the</v>

694
00:31:11.741 --> 00:31:13.360
<v Speaker 3>next flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

695
00:31:13.361 --> 00:31:13.700
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

696
00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're such a coffee geek.</v>

697
00:31:15.141 --> 00:31:18.320
<v Speaker 1>You want to geek out with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>flavors in your mouth all day.</v>

698
00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.960
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're taking it to a new level.</v>

699
00:31:20.961 --> 00:31:24.320
<v Speaker 1>You went with a paper filter just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>remove aftertaste so you can move onto</v>

700
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.720
<v Speaker 1>the next flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't you rinse it out with some</v>

701
00:31:26.721 --> 00:31:28.520
<v Speaker 1>seltzer or something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do that.</v>

702
00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some ginger like you do with</v>

703
00:31:30.411 --> 00:31:31.160
<v Speaker 1>sushi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

704

<v Speaker 1>Would that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Blood palate cleanser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

707
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.350
<v Speaker 1>You could do power plans or do you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to brush your tongue or anything like</v>

708
00:31:36.351 --> 00:31:37.310
<v Speaker 1>that in between?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do.</v>

709
00:31:37.311 --> 00:31:39.040
<v Speaker 1>There are people that scrape the tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

710
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't do any of that mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the dark end of the pool.</v>

711
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.040
<v Speaker 1>People Where you can't see the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

712
00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Your coffee geeking out in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hardcore.</v>

713
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.823
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

714
00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:52.740
<v Speaker 1>So this is a very delicious coffee and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

715
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.500
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I noticed is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

716
00:31:54.501 --> 00:31:57.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you serve it completely black.</v>

717
00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.920
<v Speaker 1>You don't fuck around wIth coffee</v>
<v Speaker 1>filters or sugars,</v>

718
00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:05.450
<v Speaker 3>but I mean genuinely coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee people don't judge people that,</v>

719
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.870
<v Speaker 3>that do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody [inaudible] to me.</v>

720
00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really sweet.</v>

721
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you put stuff in your coffee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

722
00:32:10.741 --> 00:32:11.574
<v Speaker 1>usually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

723
00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Usually we will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I wanted you to try this.</v>

724
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.720
<v Speaker 1>This is a coffee mixed with grass fed</v>
<v Speaker 1>butter and mct oil.</v>

725
00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I found about this from getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar.</v>

726
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

727
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:24.710
<v Speaker 1>This is Hawaii roasters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

728
00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:25.660
<v Speaker 1>I'll just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii roasters,</v>

729
00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.810
<v Speaker 1>rusty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rusty,</v>

730
00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:29.160
<v Speaker 1>rusty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rusty's hawaiian.</v>

731
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:30.450
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

732
00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:31.440
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

733
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I found out about this from this dude</v>
<v Speaker 1>dave asprey,</v>

734
00:32:33.301 --> 00:32:37.320
<v Speaker 1>he calls it bulletproof coffee and</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently a guy named rob wolf,</v>

735
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.490
<v Speaker 1>he was the first guy to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it is,</v>

736
00:32:39.491 --> 00:32:44.000
<v Speaker 1>is coffee mixed with grass fed butter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mct oil and then it's blended.</v>

737
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:48.230
<v Speaker 1>And the idea being that blending it all</v>
<v Speaker 1>up like that has you get all the healthy</v>

738
00:32:48.231 --> 00:32:49.970
<v Speaker 1>fats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make steam with the caffeine is sort of</v>

739
00:32:49.971 --> 00:32:50.630
<v Speaker 1>a seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

740
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.040
<v Speaker 1>medium chain triglyceride oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like</v>

741
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.360
<v Speaker 1>palm oils and mostly coconut oils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take the spinning in a centrifuge</v>

742
00:32:59.361 --> 00:33:01.430
<v Speaker 1>and extracted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the exact process,</v>

743
00:33:01.431 --> 00:33:06.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's essentially healthy fats and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's all mixed with this.</v>

744
00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:09.620
<v Speaker 1>And the benefit of it is that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all connected to the fats,</v>

745
00:33:09.621 --> 00:33:11.960
<v Speaker 1>you get sort of a slow burn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a slow release.</v>

746
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:16.370
<v Speaker 1>I get the impression from you though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you fucking hopped up on coffee all</v>

747
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:17.780
<v Speaker 1>day and a bunch of different kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need no slow release.</v>

748
00:33:17.781 --> 00:33:20.080
<v Speaker 1>You just ride in that boat right into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rocks.</v>

749
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.720
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was something you said earlier as</v>

750
00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:25.340
<v Speaker 3>we were getting started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about,</v>

751
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:27.950
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about the bars at the</v>

752
00:33:27.951 --> 00:33:31.040
<v Speaker 3>top of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you the meat bar or something like that?</v>

753
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:31.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

754
00:33:31.761 --> 00:33:32.640
<v Speaker 1>the warrior bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

755
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:35.180
<v Speaker 1>The buffalo and cranberry.</v>

756
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:40.400
<v Speaker 3>So there's a story in coffee and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know if it's it,</v>

757
00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.320
<v Speaker 3>if it's true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is the legend is that in</v>

758
00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:46.830
<v Speaker 3>ancient Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ethiopian warriors would take the</v>

759
00:33:46.831 --> 00:33:49.770
<v Speaker 3>fruits of the coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So coffee grows like a fruit.</v>

760
00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.930
<v Speaker 3>It's got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you may have seen pictures.</v>

761
00:33:51.931 --> 00:33:53.150
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a cherry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

762
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.800
<v Speaker 3>And the two beans or like flat up</v>
<v Speaker 3>against each other,</v>

763
00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:01.020
<v Speaker 3>like the pits of the cherry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But around that is like a fruit layer,</v>

764
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:03.690
<v Speaker 3>like a sweet fruit layer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fruit tastes sort of like,</v>

765
00:34:03.691 --> 00:34:07.100
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of slimy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it tastes like a mix of a,</v>

766
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:10.830
<v Speaker 3>of watermelon and jasmine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a kind of a tough</v>

767
00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:15.890
<v Speaker 3>leathery skin outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the legend says that the ethiopians</v>

768
00:34:15.901 --> 00:34:20.901
<v Speaker 3>would take that fruit and make a ball</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a animal fat in some stories,</v>

769
00:34:23.251 --> 00:34:25.850
<v Speaker 3>say butter and other stories say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

770
00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

771
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cow fat,</v>

772
00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:34.050
<v Speaker 3>and they would make balls out of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and put them in there.</v>

773
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:37.920
<v Speaker 3>They're a packs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then just before a battle,</v>

774
00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:42.300
<v Speaker 3>these warriors would eat this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this like power bar thing,</v>

775
00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:45.390
<v Speaker 3>and it was like fat from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the,</v>

776
00:34:45.391 --> 00:34:48.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the animal fat to give you energy</v>

777
00:34:48.421 --> 00:34:49.410
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and kind of.</v>

778
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:53.940
<v Speaker 3>And then the sugar from the coffee fruit</v>
<v Speaker 3>to give that blast of energy.</v>

779
00:34:53.941 --> 00:34:58.941
<v Speaker 3>And then the caffeine together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now some people say that this is like an</v>

780
00:34:59.101 --> 00:35:01.850
<v Speaker 3>invented story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other people say that,</v>

781
00:35:01.851 --> 00:35:04.230
<v Speaker 3>that you had no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what the ancient ethiopians</v>

782
00:35:04.231 --> 00:35:06.720
<v Speaker 3>actually did before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before flight fighting a battle.</v>

783
00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:09.990
<v Speaker 3>What is known is that the engine</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethiopians were known as,</v>

784
00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.980
<v Speaker 3>especially intense warriors.</v>

785
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:15.760
<v Speaker 1>How come nobody has recreated this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need an on it coffee ball.</v>

786
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.880
<v Speaker 1>We need to make that right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like something we need to.</v>

787
00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.310
<v Speaker 3>But when he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you said coffee and butter,</v>

788
00:35:21.311 --> 00:35:22.640
<v Speaker 3>that's what I thought of is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

789
00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:27.160
<v Speaker 3>is that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these coffee balls with butter?</v>

790
00:35:27.161 --> 00:35:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's what they're trying to kind</v>

791
00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:29.920
<v Speaker 3>of recreate here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

792
00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

793
00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.490
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

794
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.150
<v Speaker 1>apparently the original people have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting,</v>

795
00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:34.931
<v Speaker 1>gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

796
00:35:34.931 --> 00:35:36.910
<v Speaker 1>it had been putting that in coffee for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

797
00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:43.090
<v Speaker 5>But there was also like a yak t that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the himalayans used to tibetans used</v>

798
00:35:43.161 --> 00:35:48.161
<v Speaker 5>that was mixed with this yak butter and</v>
<v Speaker 5>t to make this creamy sort of a</v>

799
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.480
<v Speaker 5>concoction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like what I like about the mixing it</v>

800
00:35:51.481 --> 00:35:56.481
<v Speaker 5>with the butter and mct oil is that it</v>
<v Speaker 5>gives you like a long lasting effect of</v>

801
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.890
<v Speaker 5>the caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your body has to break down all those</v>

802
00:35:58.891 --> 00:36:01.650
<v Speaker 5>fats and sort of blended in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>connected with the caffeine.</v>

803
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:04.770
<v Speaker 5>You don't get it as a big burst.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I drank this stuff because I</v>

804
00:36:04.771 --> 00:36:07.440
<v Speaker 5>haven't drinking black coffee for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>while and with,</v>

805
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.060
<v Speaker 5>with nothing attached to it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just like,</v>

806
00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.070
<v Speaker 5>whew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just goes right into your system.</v>

807
00:36:11.071 --> 00:36:13.620
<v Speaker 5>And you could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could feel yourself like pepping up.</v>

808
00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:15.420
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you avoid heart attacks?</v>

809
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:16.840
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

810
00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.890
<v Speaker 3>I a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

811
00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.313
<v Speaker 5>don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

812
00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.580

<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

813
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:25.640

<v Speaker 5>This is some strong stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

816
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.470
<v Speaker 5>I guess I don't look good way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not criticizing.</v>

817
00:36:30.471 --> 00:36:30.640

<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

827
00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.750
<v Speaker 5>something I really love about coffee</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the big island.</v>

828
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:51.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I had first tried hawaiian hawaiian</v>

829
00:36:51.261 --> 00:36:55.040
<v Speaker 5>roasters is the red bag that somebody</v>
<v Speaker 5>told me about it.</v>

830
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.731
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

831
00:36:55.731 --> 00:36:58.400
<v Speaker 5>you got to try a hawaiian coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

832
00:36:58.401 --> 00:37:00.810
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a hold this stuff a while back and</v>

833
00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:05.770
<v Speaker 5>it's my all time favorite coffee just</v>
<v Speaker 5>has this like really sort of a um,</v>

834
00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:08.600
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a dark rich taste to it.</v>

835
00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.250
<v Speaker 5>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very different from this stuff.</v>

836
00:37:10.251 --> 00:37:11.760
<v Speaker 5>This ethiopian stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

837
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:14.780
<v Speaker 5>So different deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If coffee started there,</v>

838
00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.910
<v Speaker 5>it started in Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that now,</v>

839
00:37:16.911 --> 00:37:20.300
<v Speaker 5>did people take the plants and plant</v>
<v Speaker 5>them in other places?</v>

840
00:37:20.301 --> 00:37:21.170
<v Speaker 5>Is that what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

841
00:37:21.171 --> 00:37:23.810
<v Speaker 5>So what happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the ethiopians were the first ones to</v>

842
00:37:23.811 --> 00:37:26.360
<v Speaker 5>sort of discover coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what we have here,</v>

843
00:37:26.361 --> 00:37:28.250
<v Speaker 5>which we usually drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's my favorite.</v>

844
00:37:28.251 --> 00:37:30.980
<v Speaker 5>The one in the red bag.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what is it called?</v>

845
00:37:30.981 --> 00:37:33.170
<v Speaker 5>It has a name though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it says here,</v>

846
00:37:33.171 --> 00:37:35.260
<v Speaker 5>it says mocha peaberry from maui.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

847
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:40.270
<v Speaker 5>That's like a 94 on the coffee's so good</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

848
00:37:40.921 --> 00:37:41.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

849
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.210
<v Speaker 3>But this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is part of the story I can tell</v>

850
00:37:43.211 --> 00:37:44.044
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>

851
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.720
<v Speaker 3>You were asking about coffee coming from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ethiopia,</v>

852
00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.640
<v Speaker 3>etc. Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

853
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:49.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

854
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.580
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

855
00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:53.260
<v Speaker 3>This is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're really tiny,</v>

856
00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:55.240
<v Speaker 3>really tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

857
00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:59.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened was from the forests of</v>

858
00:37:59.351 --> 00:38:01.300
<v Speaker 3>Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

859
00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:03.700
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on either side of what's called the rift</v>

860
00:38:03.701 --> 00:38:05.170
<v Speaker 3>valley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's where it's,</v>

861
00:38:05.171 --> 00:38:09.310
<v Speaker 3>where the human species evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's where we evolved over there and</v>

862
00:38:09.311 --> 00:38:11.740
<v Speaker 3>coffee have all been in the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

863
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:12.653
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

864
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:15.820
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

865
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:16.450
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

866
00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:20.890
<v Speaker 3>the ethiopians consumed it somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then the,</v>

867
00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:25.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow probably by the people on the</v>

868
00:38:25.001 --> 00:38:27.730
<v Speaker 3>other side of the red sea and what's now</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yemen,</v>

869
00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:32.410
<v Speaker 3>which was then called arabia felix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like in,</v>

870
00:38:32.411 --> 00:38:33.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about uh,</v>

871
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.670
<v Speaker 3>1100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said they said,</v>

872
00:38:36.671 --> 00:38:38.560
<v Speaker 3>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got some,</v>

873
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:43.590
<v Speaker 3>some of the ethiopian slaves brought</v>
<v Speaker 3>some coffee seeds over there and they</v>

874
00:38:44.501 --> 00:38:47.050
<v Speaker 3>started planting coffee in what's now</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yemen.</v>

875
00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.640
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they started growing it and it</v>

876
00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:55.120
<v Speaker 3>turned into a big deal and they were the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first ones that actually expoRted it out</v>

877
00:38:55.121 --> 00:38:57.040
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the area.</v>

878
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:58.510
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

879
00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.130
<v Speaker 3>and the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the port,</v>

880
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.620
<v Speaker 3>the main port at that time in Yemen was</v>
<v Speaker 3>called mocha.</v>

881
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.670
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

882
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:04.990
<v Speaker 4>you've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

883
00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:09.010
<v Speaker 4>have a cafe mocha or coffee is called</v>
<v Speaker 4>mocha mocha,</v>

884
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:10.810
<v Speaker 4>mocha,</v>
<v Speaker 4>java,</v>

885
00:39:10.811 --> 00:39:13.630
<v Speaker 4>all That stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all a reference to this one port</v>

886
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:15.820
<v Speaker 4>in Yemen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's still there.</v>

887
00:39:15.821 --> 00:39:17.680
<v Speaker 4>It's called alma alpaca.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

888
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.173
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

889
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:21.250
<v Speaker 4>I thought mocha had something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 4>chocolate.</v>

890
00:39:21.251 --> 00:39:21.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

891
00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.520
<v Speaker 4>we in the now in the states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

892
00:39:24.521 --> 00:39:25.420
<v Speaker 4>we kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

893
00:39:25.421 --> 00:39:29.020
<v Speaker 4>it's that people started adding</v>
<v Speaker 4>chocolate to coffee that wasn't from</v>

894
00:39:29.021 --> 00:39:31.350
<v Speaker 4>there to try to make it taste like it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was from there.</v>

895
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.050
<v Speaker 4>So it had a natural chunk actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>chocolatey taste to it.</v>

896
00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.350
<v Speaker 4>Can you still get coffee from you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard because it's Yemen,</v>

897
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

898
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:42.400
<v Speaker 4>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a difficult place to do business</v>

899
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:43.870
<v Speaker 4>and need to make friends with prince</v>
<v Speaker 4>naseem.</v>

900
00:39:43.871 --> 00:39:45.400
<v Speaker 4>How mad do you remember that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

901
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.880
<v Speaker 4>he was a boxer from Yemen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did a lot of wild shit.</v>

902
00:39:48.881 --> 00:39:50.740
<v Speaker 4>came in on a magic carpet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

903
00:39:50.741 --> 00:39:52.300
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to dance around the ring.</v>

904
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:54.660
<v Speaker 4>Yemen's an amazing place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've,</v>

905
00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.890
<v Speaker 4>I've never been there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've seen lots of pictures.</v>

906
00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:01.330
<v Speaker 4>I've known lots of yemeni people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just politically politically</v>

907
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:02.710
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Volatile.</v>

908
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:05.510
<v Speaker 4>But that's unfoRtunate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like it's something unique</v>

909
00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:06.810
<v Speaker 4>coffee out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But so,</v>

910
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.400
<v Speaker 4>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they brought,</v>

911
00:40:09.401 --> 00:40:10.510
<v Speaker 4>when they brought coffee for me,</v>

912
00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:14.910
<v Speaker 3>Ethiopia tm and they brought only a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>plants and then they use those to be the</v>

913
00:40:14.911 --> 00:40:17.250
<v Speaker 3>parents of all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

914
00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coffee in Yemen and that they were</v>

915
00:40:20.071 --> 00:40:22.560
<v Speaker 3>the ones that exported it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>

916
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:26.280
<v Speaker 3>but then this is in history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were Growing coffee,</v>

917
00:40:26.281 --> 00:40:28.200
<v Speaker 3>they were exporting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other people said,</v>

918
00:40:28.201 --> 00:40:30.060
<v Speaker 3>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want end on this coffee deal because</v>

919
00:40:30.061 --> 00:40:32.790
<v Speaker 3>you're making money selling coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they had a.</v>

920
00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.940
<v Speaker 3>They had a penalty of death if you got</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeds,</v>

921
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.790
<v Speaker 3>if you took seeds out of Yemen at that</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

922
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:43.230
<v Speaker 3>you got caught exporting fertile coffee</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeds you can be put to death.</v>

923
00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:44.910
<v Speaker 3>It was that valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that valuable.</v>

924
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:47.320
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is at a time where when like</v>

925
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:52.110
<v Speaker 3>the english and the dutch were fighting</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the dutch east indies as the spice</v>

926
00:40:52.111 --> 00:40:53.040
<v Speaker 3>islands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

927
00:40:53.041 --> 00:40:53.874
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these,</v>

928
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:58.260
<v Speaker 3>everybody was trying to get some</v>
<v Speaker 3>colonies going to export these cash</v>

929
00:40:58.261 --> 00:41:00.330
<v Speaker 3>crops and they saw coffee as a potential</v>
<v Speaker 3>cash crop.</v>

930
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Some dutch spies successfully got some</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee out of Yemen and they planted it</v>

931
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:10.890
<v Speaker 3>on and they had just won the war with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the english over the dutch east indies</v>

932
00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:16.220
<v Speaker 3>and they planted the coffee that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>stole from Yemen in what's now Indonesia</v>

933
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.670
<v Speaker 3>on the island of java.</v>

934
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.570
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they turned that they did great.</v>

935
00:41:21.571 --> 00:41:22.590
<v Speaker 4>They.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They planned it.</v>

936
00:41:22.591 --> 00:41:24.600
<v Speaker 4>All these farms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were producing coffee and that's</v>

937
00:41:24.601 --> 00:41:27.720
<v Speaker 4>why we still call it coffee java.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

938
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:30.830
<v Speaker 4>So in mocha java,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mocha java is in,</v>

939
00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>150 years ago.</v>

940
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 4>those were the two places</v>

941
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.600
<v Speaker 3>that made most of the coffee in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

942
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:40.930
<v Speaker 3>The port of mocha in Yemen and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>island of java in the dutch east indies.</v>

943
00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Ethiopia back then,</v>

944
00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:46.840
<v Speaker 1>like if that's where it all started</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

945
00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:49.750
<v Speaker 1>they weren't exporting anything then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just like letting it go.</v>

946
00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.600
<v Speaker 3>It would juSt eat drinking it</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

947
00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:52.590
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

948
00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.830
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't build an export market so.</v>

949
00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.970
<v Speaker 3>So then it gets weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ready?</v>

950
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:01.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

951
00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the in the,</v>

952
00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:08.810
<v Speaker 3>at one point the dutch and the french</v>
<v Speaker 3>signed a treaty and like,</v>

953
00:42:09.391 --> 00:42:10.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

954
00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:14.940
<v Speaker 3>some sort of treaty and as a gift the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dutch gave one coffee tree to the</v>

955
00:42:14.941 --> 00:42:19.460
<v Speaker 3>french,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one coffee tree and the french in like,</v>

956
00:42:19.461 --> 00:42:21.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in France they built a,</v>

957
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.400
<v Speaker 3>a hot house like a greenhouse just to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold this plant.</v>

958
00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.040
<v Speaker 3>And it was the first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the first greenhouse in europe.</v>

959
00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.780
<v Speaker 3>The first greenhouse in europe was for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee.</v>

960
00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

961
00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:37.170
<v Speaker 3>and they planted other stuff there too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this coffee plant was like really</v>

962
00:42:37.171 --> 00:42:40.770
<v Speaker 3>special and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they used cuttings from that plant</v>

963
00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:44.730
<v Speaker 3>to plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to plant some stuff in the</v>

964
00:42:44.731 --> 00:42:46.170
<v Speaker 3>west indies and the caribbean.</v>

965
00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to plant some coffee,</v>

966
00:42:48.211 --> 00:42:53.211
<v Speaker 3>the french did to for their colonies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this one guy named gabriela the</v>

967
00:42:53.341 --> 00:42:58.341
<v Speaker 3>clue he was responsible for bringing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee from France to martinique,</v>

968
00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:03.780
<v Speaker 3>but so he brought this one plant and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>had it in a glass box,</v>

969
00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.290
<v Speaker 3>but they ran out of wind on the journey</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the.</v>

970
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.600
<v Speaker 3>So they were stuck in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>atlantic ocean.</v>

971
00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:12.330
<v Speaker 3>Gabriela,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the clue was sharing his water ration</v>

972
00:43:12.331 --> 00:43:14.690
<v Speaker 3>with this plant to keep it alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>

973
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:17.100
<v Speaker 3>He managed to keep it alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>planted it.</v>

974
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:22.190
<v Speaker 3>And that one plant was the parent of</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the coffee in central America,</v>

975
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:25.950
<v Speaker 3>south ameRica,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc. Holy shit.</v>

976
00:43:25.951 --> 00:43:27.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

977
00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:32.180
<v Speaker 3>so now there's a scientific impact to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this because all the genetic diversity</v>

978
00:43:32.761 --> 00:43:35.100
<v Speaker 3>that was in Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the thousands of different coffee</v>

979
00:43:35.101 --> 00:43:39.630
<v Speaker 3>varieties that were in Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine how that got narrowed down from</v>

980
00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:43.290
<v Speaker 3>getting a brought from Ethiopia tm in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first place.</v>

981
00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Then whatever plants those dutch spies a</v>
<v Speaker 3>stole to put the coffee in java.</v>

982
00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:54.830
<v Speaker 3>Then that one plant that went to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that went to the new world that went to</v>

983
00:43:55.711 --> 00:43:58.800
<v Speaker 3>France first and then to the new world</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

984
00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:03.600
<v Speaker 3>they call it a genetic bottleneck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so all the coffee outside of Ethiopia is</v>

985
00:44:03.601 --> 00:44:08.250
<v Speaker 3>kind of siblings to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible and that.</v>

986
00:44:08.251 --> 00:44:10.680
<v Speaker 3>And that's a problem for us because if</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a disease that,</v>

987
00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:15.030
<v Speaker 3>that one genetic variety of coffee is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is susceptible to,</v>

988
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:17.430
<v Speaker 3>it can wipe out the whole coffee deal.</v>

989
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:22.860
<v Speaker 1>it's so incredible that one particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>area of the world was the only place</v>

990
00:44:22.861 --> 00:44:26.430
<v Speaker 1>where this stuff was growing and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's considered to be a completely</v>

991
00:44:26.431 --> 00:44:27.330
<v Speaker 1>worldwide beverage.</v>

992
00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

993
00:44:28.391 --> 00:44:31.680
<v Speaker 3>And the ethiopians are kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're kind of pissed off about that.</v>

994
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:34.830
<v Speaker 3>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go and you talked to them and</v>

995
00:44:34.831 --> 00:44:36.120
<v Speaker 3>they're like [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

996
00:44:36.121 --> 00:44:41.121
<v Speaker 3>everybody says they've identified coffee</v>
<v Speaker 3>with columbia right now while fucking</v>

997
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:43.800
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they hate,</v>

998
00:44:43.801 --> 00:44:47.160
<v Speaker 3>they hate one valdez and epo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

999
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.010
<v Speaker 3>that's our thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's our thing that the world is</v>

1000
00:44:50.011 --> 00:44:50.850
<v Speaker 3>getting richard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1001
00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.400
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1002
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:53.310
<v Speaker 3>but that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1003
00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:55.020
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go to Ethiopia,</v>

1004
00:44:55.070 --> 00:45:00.060
<v Speaker 3>the different kinds of flavors that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can get in coffee from Ethiopia is crazy</v>

1005
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:04.020
<v Speaker 3>compared to any anywhere else I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying was the genetic diversity genetic</v>

1006
00:45:04.021 --> 00:45:05.880
<v Speaker 3>diversity thing each,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each.</v>

1007
00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:08.250
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each village in Ethiopia has their own</v>

1008
00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:10.620
<v Speaker 3>variety of coffee that they grow</v>
<v Speaker 3>traditionally.</v>

1009
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many different varieties are there?</v>

1010
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>

1011
00:45:14.731 --> 00:45:17.430
<v Speaker 3>We don't know completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're still doing their scientists</v>

1012
00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:21.570
<v Speaker 3>that are out in Ethiopia right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to count all the different coffee</v>

1013
00:45:21.571 --> 00:45:25.290
<v Speaker 3>varieties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the estimation is that there are</v>

1014
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:29.820
<v Speaker 3>somewhere between three and 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>different varieties of coffee growing</v>

1015
00:45:29.821 --> 00:45:33.840
<v Speaker 3>wild in Ethiopia and outside of Ethiopia</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was like 30.</v>

1016
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:35.520
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1017
00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:37.020
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1018
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:38.040
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

1019
00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:41.350
<v Speaker 1>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every legit coffee connoisseur is</v>

1020
00:45:41.351 --> 00:45:44.020
<v Speaker 1>like a big fan of Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have like in Ethiopia tee shirt</v>

1021
00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:48.290
<v Speaker 1>that you were in the spot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like brazilian jujitsu.</v>

1022
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Brazil is the spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1023
00:45:49.661 --> 00:45:51.760
<v Speaker 1>So you can pop up the origins center of</v>
<v Speaker 1>origin,</v>

1024
00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to get into taekwondo,</v>

1025
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.580
<v Speaker 1>you go to Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1026
00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1027
00:45:55.991 --> 00:45:57.660
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1028
00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:01.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this particular blend that we had is</v>

1029
00:46:01.511 --> 00:46:05.950
<v Speaker 1>from Ethiopia and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the variables in ethiopian</v>

1030
00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.270
<v Speaker 1>coffees?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's,</v>

1031
00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:08.350
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

1032
00:46:08.351 --> 00:46:09.880
<v Speaker 1>say the name again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you said you're a good chef.</v>

1033
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:14.080
<v Speaker 1>You're a chef and a chef is a fruiTy</v>
<v Speaker 1>floral one,</v>

1034
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:18.250
<v Speaker 1>but I would assume that with thousands</v>
<v Speaker 1>of different varieties you get a broad</v>

1035
00:46:18.251 --> 00:46:19.870
<v Speaker 1>spectrum of different flavors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1036
00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.230
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in,</v>

1037
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:23.170
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1038
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:27.830
<v Speaker 3>just north of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of yoga chef is a kind of a larger area.</v>

1039
00:46:27.831 --> 00:46:31.870
<v Speaker 3>And actually you're a chef is within an</v>
<v Speaker 3>area called saddam is the name of the</v>

1040
00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:36.890
<v Speaker 3>region and we call coffees from there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dominoes dominoes are similar to</v>

1041
00:46:37.731 --> 00:46:40.190
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] but they're not as floral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tend to be sweeter.</v>

1042
00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.950
<v Speaker 3>They tasted like honey to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1043
00:46:42.951 --> 00:46:43.960
<v Speaker 3>they have a honey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1044

<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Pretension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damo,</v>

1049
00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:55.111
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1050
00:46:55.111 --> 00:46:56.930
<v Speaker 3>There's different ones that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

1051
00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:00.690
<v Speaker 3>that names that you get besides sidamo</v>
<v Speaker 3>will often be,</v>

1052
00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:02.070
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1053
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:06.040
<v Speaker 3>or even yoga chef will often be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>specific name of a washing station will</v>

1054
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:09.090
<v Speaker 3>wash the coffee itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1055
00:47:09.091 --> 00:47:12.570
<v Speaker 3>and so you can get geeky about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But sidamo is in what way?</v>

1056
00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:14.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see people develop favorite,</v>

1057
00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:16.700
<v Speaker 1>favorite washing stations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1058
00:47:16.701 --> 00:47:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's the variables in the washing</v>

1059
00:47:19.041 --> 00:47:21.210
<v Speaker 1>process?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Changes the way the flavor is.</v>

1060
00:47:21.211 --> 00:47:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1061
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.950
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1062
00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:26.310
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I noticed I listened to a</v>

1063
00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:29.170
<v Speaker 3>podcast you did recently that had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>nutritionist and you've been talking</v>

1064
00:47:29.171 --> 00:47:31.990
<v Speaker 3>about washing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>washed coffee being important.</v>

1065
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.540
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought I could explain that</v>

1066
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.280
<v Speaker 3>process to you if you want me to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1067
00:47:36.281 --> 00:47:37.114
<v Speaker 3>please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1068
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:42.510
<v Speaker 3>So it's all about how the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you that coffee beans are like</v>

1069
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:47.590
<v Speaker 3>two seeds inside of the cherry and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to get that fruit off because if you</v>

1070
00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:52.770
<v Speaker 3>don't get the fruit off it can mold and</v>
<v Speaker 3>spoil and tastes yucky.</v>

1071
00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:56.500
<v Speaker 3>So the whole challenge with coffee is</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1072
00:47:56.830 --> 00:48:00.340
<v Speaker 3>is to do something with that fruit layer</v>
<v Speaker 3>before it spoils.</v>

1073
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

1074
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.550
<v Speaker 3>because like any fruits of any kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fruit,</v>

1075
00:48:03.551 --> 00:48:05.830
<v Speaker 3>you pick it and then you either you</v>
<v Speaker 3>either do.</v>

1076
00:48:05.831 --> 00:48:10.450
<v Speaker 3>So whaT the ancient ethiopians did is</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just picked it and they set it on</v>

1077
00:48:10.451 --> 00:48:13.980
<v Speaker 3>the ground or on a mat to dry and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

1078
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.000
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1079
00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:17.650
<v Speaker 3>the coffee would sort of turn into</v>
<v Speaker 3>shrivel up,</v>

1080
00:48:17.651 --> 00:48:20.200
<v Speaker 3>turn into a raisin and once it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally dry,</v>

1081
00:48:20.201 --> 00:48:24.400
<v Speaker 3>they'd pound it in a mortar and pestle</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the seeds that would separate from</v>

1082
00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:26.470
<v Speaker 3>the dried up husk.</v>

1083
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:29.500
<v Speaker 3>And then you could roast the seeds and</v>
<v Speaker 3>drink the coffee.</v>

1084
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:31.420
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1085
00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.300
<v Speaker 3>that was the original method of doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>

1086
00:48:34.301 --> 00:48:37.390
<v Speaker 3>but when they moved coffee from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ethiopia,</v>

1087
00:48:37.391 --> 00:48:40.180
<v Speaker 3>which is very warm and dry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they could,</v>

1088
00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:43.780
<v Speaker 3>they could grow it in Indonesia and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>central America,</v>

1089
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.360
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it grow fine.</v>

1090
00:48:46.361 --> 00:48:49.840
<v Speaker 3>But when they tried to dry it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was tougher because there's more rain</v>

1091
00:48:49.841 --> 00:48:51.660
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more humid and the coffee would</v>

1092
00:48:51.661 --> 00:48:56.380
<v Speaker 3>mold and get musty and tastes crappy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in sent in Costa Rica,</v>

1093
00:48:56.381 --> 00:48:59.530
<v Speaker 3>they invented a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what they did was they ran it</v>

1094
00:48:59.531 --> 00:49:02.050
<v Speaker 3>through a machine that would take strip</v>
<v Speaker 3>off the,</v>

1095
00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:03.360
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1096
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:05.920
<v Speaker 3>the leathery skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1097
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:10.000
<v Speaker 3>well the leathery skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would leave this slimy fruit,</v>

1098
00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's sort of like,</v>

1099
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:13.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you eat a peach and some of the</v>

1100
00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.700
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sticks to the seed.</v>

1101
00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:17.860
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly what happens to</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee.</v>

1102
00:49:17.861 --> 00:49:22.861
<v Speaker 3>It's the sticky fruity stuff is sticking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the seed and you got to get it off.</v>

1103
00:49:23.531 --> 00:49:27.250
<v Speaker 3>So what they did was they let it ferment</v>
<v Speaker 3>for about a day.</v>

1104
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:31.780
<v Speaker 3>And if you let that stuff for men in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bucket or a whatever,</v>

1105
00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:34.640
<v Speaker 3>a tUb for about a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it,</v>

1106
00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.510
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looSened itself through magic.</v>

1107
00:49:37.511 --> 00:49:38.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like amaziNg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1108
00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:39.240
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1109
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:44.240
<v Speaker 3>the bacterial action and yeasts and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff act on that stuff to dissolve it.</v>

1110
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:46.720
<v Speaker 3>And then you can wash it away with</v>
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>

1111
00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:48.670
<v Speaker 3>just rinses right off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's wet process,</v>

1112
00:49:48.671 --> 00:49:52.030
<v Speaker 3>that's wet processing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once that sticky,</v>

1113
00:49:52.031 --> 00:49:55.000
<v Speaker 3>slimy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sugary stuff is rinsed away,</v>

1114
00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:58.450
<v Speaker 3>then it's very easy to dry the coffee in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sun.</v>

1115
00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:03.490
<v Speaker 3>It dries in a few days and then you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>husk it and send it for roasting.</v>

1116
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:07.970
<v Speaker 1>So there's a difference between drying</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out and then roasting.</v>

1117
00:50:07.971 --> 00:50:11.210
<v Speaker 1>It must be dried out first and then it</v>
<v Speaker 1>must be roasted later.</v>

1118
00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1119
00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:12.450
<v Speaker 3>So there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1120
00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:16.180
<v Speaker 3>So in those two processes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those two major processes,</v>

1121
00:50:16.181 --> 00:50:21.181
<v Speaker 3>or we call them either dry processing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and wet processing or the natural method</v>

1122
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:27.380
<v Speaker 3>and the washed method,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so washed and and wet processing the</v>

1123
00:50:27.381 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 3>same thing</v>

1124
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.670
<v Speaker 4>and dried and natural is the same thing.</v>

1125
00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:35.740
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a certain way I'm changing</v>

1126
00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:39.940
<v Speaker 1>climates and moving coffee plants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>other geographic locations.</v>

1127
00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Presented a lot of pretty unique</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges.</v>

1128
00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For coffee they were doing in the 19th</v>

1129
00:50:44.171 --> 00:50:46.540
<v Speaker 1>century it seems so different than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else,</v>

1130
00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:48.460
<v Speaker 1>which is also a fruit that you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow me.</v>

1131
00:50:48.461 --> 00:50:50.390
<v Speaker 1>You would just take it when it's ripe</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you eat it when it's ripe,</v>

1132
00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:53.440
<v Speaker 1>but this seems like a really complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because what you're doing</v>

1133
00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:56.020
<v Speaker 4>student,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean unlike most fruits,</v>

1134
00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:58.210
<v Speaker 4>most fruits aren't cultivated for their</v>
<v Speaker 4>seeds.</v>

1135
00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Is there outside of the seed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the isn't the abstract like the outside</v>

1136
00:51:03.031 --> 00:51:04.560
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have some sort of nutritional</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit?</v>

1137
00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:05.370
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's,</v>

1138
00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:06.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fruit,</v>

1139
00:51:06.661 --> 00:51:09.240
<v Speaker 4>it's got sugar and it's got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it taste like?</v>

1140
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:13.590
<v Speaker 4>It tastes like I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always say it's like a mixture of,</v>

1141
00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.390
<v Speaker 4>of watermelon and a jasmine real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1142
00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.100
<v Speaker 4>it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds delicious.</v>

1143
00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.430
<v Speaker 4>Delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's totally delicious.</v>

1144
00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.030
<v Speaker 4>You can't just buy coffee fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you can.</v>

1145
00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:28.740
<v Speaker 4>The problem is that if they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Coffee doesn't really grow around here.</v>

1146
00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:30.390
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So by the time they got it to you,</v>

1147
00:51:30.391 --> 00:51:32.610
<v Speaker 4>it'd be spoiled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do they do?</v>

1148
00:51:32.611 --> 00:51:34.710
<v Speaker 4>Here's a few things for you and I should</v>
<v Speaker 4>have brought some for you.</v>

1149
00:51:34.711 --> 00:51:35.544
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1150
00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:40.600
<v Speaker 4>some places they keep the fruit that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they husk off and they drive that to a</v>

1151
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:45.420
<v Speaker 4>and you can make sort of like a beverage</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of that by soaking that beverage in</v>

1152
00:51:45.421 --> 00:51:46.980
<v Speaker 4>water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>treating it like tea.</v>

1153
00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:51.160
<v Speaker 4>And they do that in Ethiopia and in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yemen they call it has shara and Yemen.</v>

1154
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:52.740
<v Speaker 4>They call it kesher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in,</v>

1155
00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:54.390
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean sharon,</v>

1156
00:51:54.391 --> 00:51:55.770
<v Speaker 4>Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kenya and Yemen.</v>

1157
00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:01.460
<v Speaker 4>And so it's another beverage that comes</v>
<v Speaker 4>from coffee and it's sweet and it's got</v>

1158
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:03.840
<v Speaker 4>plenty of caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1159
00:52:03.841 --> 00:52:04.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1160
00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:07.670
<v Speaker 4>and then more popular it seems like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be more popular.</v>

1161
00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.960
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would think that that would be maybe</v>

1162
00:52:09.961 --> 00:52:11.070
<v Speaker 4>this new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of.</v>

1163
00:52:11.071 --> 00:52:12.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you call it again?</v>

1164
00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:15.390
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of places that sell it here,</v>

<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1166
00:52:16.861 --> 00:52:17.251
<v Speaker 4>s,</v>
<v Speaker 4>c,</v>

1167
00:52:17.251 --> 00:52:18.960
<v Speaker 4>a r a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the spanish word for it.</v>

1168
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:20.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scada that now.</v>

1169
00:52:20.461 --> 00:52:22.410
<v Speaker 4>Is that what you said?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Starbucks could start selling.</v>

1170
00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:23.070
<v Speaker 4>They could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1171
00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:24.290
<v Speaker 4>Why don't they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

1172
00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:25.350
<v Speaker 4>Fuck's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Starbucks.</v>

1173
00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.270
<v Speaker 4>Get on the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then she bitches like money.</v>

1174
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.760
<v Speaker 4>But like there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's other coffee companies sell it</v>

1175
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:31.090
<v Speaker 4>and it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1176
00:52:31.091 --> 00:52:31.950
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of an,</v>

1177
00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:34.680
<v Speaker 4>it's not satisfying in the same way that</v>
<v Speaker 4>coffee is,</v>

1178
00:52:34.681 --> 00:52:37.050
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of an oddity you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll try it.</v>

1179
00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:37.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I certainly will.</v>

1180
00:52:37.981 --> 00:52:39.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You tell me what that sounds</v>

1181
00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:40.140
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Coskata.</v>

1182
00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:41.790
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta remember that now.</v>

1183
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:46.040
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual beiNg itself.</v>

1184
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Is there more caffeine in the fruity</v>
<v Speaker 1>outer layer or is there more caffeine in</v>

1185
00:52:49.821 --> 00:52:50.790
<v Speaker 1>the bean itself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know</v>

1186
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:51.770
<v Speaker 4>the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1187
00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:56.100
<v Speaker 4>But there's theory and there's coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

1188
00:52:56.101 --> 00:52:57.030
<v Speaker 4>It varies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

1189
00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:59.830
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's caffeine in all parts of the,</v>

1190
00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:01.890
<v Speaker 4>the coffee plant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the leaves,</v>

1191
00:53:01.891 --> 00:53:02.521
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1192
00:53:02.521 --> 00:53:04.930
<v Speaker 4>It's there and everybody even look like</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what it looks.</v>

1193
00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:06.390
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's about,</v>

1194
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:08.850
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it depends on the variety of coffee,</v>

1195
00:53:08.851 --> 00:53:12.480
<v Speaker 4>but generally they're about eight feet</v>
<v Speaker 4>tall at the bush.</v>

1196
00:53:12.481 --> 00:53:14.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All I know about that as now that I'm</v>

1197
00:53:14.281 --> 00:53:16.230
<v Speaker 4>realizing it's fucking Juan Valdez,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1198
00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:20.010
<v Speaker 4>Juan valdez.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only why they did they really got</v>

1199
00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.920
<v Speaker 4>attached to that burrow and him with his</v>
<v Speaker 4>coffee beans.</v>

1200
00:53:22.921 --> 00:53:23.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

1201
00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How odd now</v>

1202
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:30.840
<v Speaker 5>is there a variation in the caffeine</v>
<v Speaker 5>content of beans from one part of the</v>

1203
00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:34.140
<v Speaker 5>world to the other?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I've seen something called</v>

1204
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:39.900
<v Speaker 5>kicking horse that was called kicking</v>
<v Speaker 5>horse coffee claims to have super</v>

1205
00:53:39.901 --> 00:53:41.580
<v Speaker 5>excessive amount of caffeine.</v>

1206
00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1207
00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:43.600
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that brand,</v>

1208
00:53:43.601 --> 00:53:47.560
<v Speaker 3>but what they might be talking about is</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's another species of coffee.</v>

1209
00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:51.250
<v Speaker 3>So I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's the species that we've been</v>

1210
00:53:51.251 --> 00:53:54.250
<v Speaker 3>talking about from Ethiopia and all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff is called cafe.</v>

1211
00:53:54.310 --> 00:53:56.470
<v Speaker 3>Arabica is the name of that spa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1212
00:53:56.610 --> 00:54:01.610
<v Speaker 3>So theRe's another species that comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the western part of africa and um,</v>

1213
00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:05.740
<v Speaker 3>it's called cafe canephora,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we call it robust.</v>

1214
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:07.220
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard of her breasts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1215
00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:09.610
<v Speaker 3>So robust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes from west africa.</v>

1216
00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:12.490
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't taste as good generally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1217
00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:13.480
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1218
00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:15.760
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my experience,</v>

1219
00:54:15.761 --> 00:54:17.490
<v Speaker 3>it tastes like burnt popcorn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1220
00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheap diner coffee has that burden,</v>

1221
00:54:19.721 --> 00:54:22.960
<v Speaker 3>popcorn kind of taste to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's from the robust data in it.</v>

1222
00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.270
<v Speaker 5>And they've used burnt popcorn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1223
00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.420
<v Speaker 5>Rubber star diner in white plains,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dr.</v>

1224
00:54:29.421 --> 00:54:31.130
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to eat it this fucking place.</v>

1225
00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:33.950
<v Speaker 5>Their coffee was just always like burnt</v>
<v Speaker 5>popcorn.</v>

1226
00:54:33.951 --> 00:54:36.380
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even thought of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it tasted like shit.</v>

1227
00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:38.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's the robusta in it.</v>

1228
00:54:39.050 --> 00:54:41.210
<v Speaker 5>Never bust.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That has a lot more caffeine than,</v>

1229
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:43.130
<v Speaker 5>than,</v>
<v Speaker 5>than arabica does.</v>

1230
00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:45.860
<v Speaker 5>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it also has a bunch of other</v>

1231
00:54:45.861 --> 00:54:48.890
<v Speaker 5>chemicals that don't taste very good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1232
00:54:48.891 --> 00:54:52.010
<v Speaker 5>so that's why it's got such a jolt to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it tastes like shit.</v>

1233
00:54:52.011 --> 00:54:52.410
<v Speaker 5>So some</v>

1234
00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:55.180
<v Speaker 3>people I've seen people talk about high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1235
00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:58.220
<v Speaker 3>high caffeine coffee and they're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>using robust enough to sort of,</v>

1236
00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.950
<v Speaker 3>to sort of amp up the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1237
00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:02.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1238
00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:04.040
<v Speaker 3>the caffeine level,</v>

1239
00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:07.170
<v Speaker 5>let's I think floating around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the scoop scoop.</v>

1240
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:10.670
<v Speaker 5>I didn't take it up and jamie were</v>
<v Speaker 5>drinking plastic soup here.</v>

1241
00:55:10.671 --> 00:55:12.070
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

1242
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:15.610
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean obviously caffeine is an</v>

1243
00:55:15.611 --> 00:55:19.230
<v Speaker 5>important part of the deal without it</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fit,</v>

1244
00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:20.740
<v Speaker 5>let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a drug.</v>

1245
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:25.540
<v Speaker 5>The ride wouldn't be nearly as a line</v>
<v Speaker 5>list nearly as long.</v>

1246
00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:26.340
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1247
00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:27.173
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

1248
00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.040
<v Speaker 3>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you've satisfied the caffeine,</v>

1249
00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.033
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part,</v>

1250
00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:34.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start drinking coffee for what it</v>

1251
00:55:34.481 --> 00:55:39.481
<v Speaker 3>tastes like and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so people that are focused on coffee</v>

1252
00:55:41.081 --> 00:55:45.390
<v Speaker 3>flavor tend to deemphasize the jolt part</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1253
00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:47.310
<v Speaker 3>and emphasize</v>

1254
00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:48.470
<v Speaker 5>the flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the flavor part.</v>

1255
00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:49.990
<v Speaker 5>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the orange,</v>

1256
00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:52.610
<v Speaker 5>why does the plant produce caffeine in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first place?</v>

1257
00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:54.200
<v Speaker 5>Is that we know that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1258
00:55:54.201 --> 00:55:54.830
<v Speaker 5>it's an</v>

1259
00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:56.830
<v Speaker 3>called an alkaloid is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the,</v>

1260
00:55:57.070 --> 00:55:57.903
<v Speaker 3>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1261
00:55:57.970 --> 00:55:59.830
<v Speaker 3>class of chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The caffeine is.</v>

1262
00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:02.410
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>

1263
00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:05.410
<v Speaker 3>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plants seem to,</v>

1264
00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:09.610
<v Speaker 3>to produce alkaloids to drive away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1265
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:10.540
<v Speaker 3>predation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1266
00:56:10.541 --> 00:56:12.070
<v Speaker 3>like insects and stuff like that.</v>

1267
00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:14.830
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the insects eat the coffee,</v>

1268
00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:19.630
<v Speaker 5>have a fucking heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 5>follow scott that's toxIc to insects at</v>

1269
00:56:19.631 --> 00:56:21.580
<v Speaker 5>a micro level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the animals,</v>

1270
00:56:21.581 --> 00:56:22.740
<v Speaker 5>a lot of animals as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1271
00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.840
<v Speaker 5>But from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the reason why dogs don't like</v>

1272
00:56:25.841 --> 00:56:27.550
<v Speaker 5>chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We shouLd feed your dog chocolate.</v>

1273
00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:30.640
<v Speaker 3>It's another alkaloid called</v>
<v Speaker 3>theobromine.</v>

1274
00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.380
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1275
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.420
<v Speaker 3>so theobromine</v>
<v Speaker 3>chocolate has and it's very similar to</v>

1276
00:56:37.421 --> 00:56:40.210
<v Speaker 3>caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll make you your heart.</v>

1277
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:42.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I talked to a veterinarian about</v>

1278
00:56:42.431 --> 00:56:45.910
<v Speaker 3>this once and the problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with dogs is they eat a bunch of</v>

1279
00:56:45.911 --> 00:56:48.520
<v Speaker 3>chocolate and their heart pounds so</v>
<v Speaker 3>fast.</v>

1280
00:56:48.521 --> 00:56:49.900
<v Speaker 3>They have a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1281
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:51.130
<v Speaker 3>From the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the,</v>

1282
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:52.353
<v Speaker 3>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1283
00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:55.060
<v Speaker 3>theobromine and it's like caffeine and</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1284
00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:56.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people say that,</v>

1285
00:56:56.590 --> 00:56:58.570
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chocolate has caffeine,</v>

1286
00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:01.480
<v Speaker 3>that active thing is actually feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>bromine,</v>

1287
00:57:01.481 --> 00:57:02.314
<v Speaker 3>which is.</v>

1288
00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:04.530
<v Speaker 5>So it's an alkaloid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very similar.</v>

1289
00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:07.920
<v Speaker 5>It's a stimulant that works on dogs in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>different way that it works on humans.</v>

1290
00:57:07.921 --> 00:57:08.591
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1291
00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:10.260
<v Speaker 5>It's the dogs are more susceptible to</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1292
00:57:10.350 --> 00:57:14.460
<v Speaker 5>That's fascinating because in humans it</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually has some weird like</v>

1293
00:57:14.461 --> 00:57:16.050
<v Speaker 5>representation of love.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1294
00:57:16.051 --> 00:57:18.110
<v Speaker 5>It gives a very similar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they say yeah.</v>

1295
00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:19.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just kind of makes sense.</v>

1296
00:57:19.501 --> 00:57:20.820
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They give chocolate to people.</v>

1297
00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then that's what they say.</v>

1298
00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:24.173
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1299
00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:25.080
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>

1300
00:57:25.081 --> 00:57:26.970
<v Speaker 3>if I drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I eat too much chocolate,</v>

1301
00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:29.050
<v Speaker 3>my heart pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can feel it much,</v>

1302
00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:30.000
<v Speaker 3>much more than.</v>

1303
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:30.781
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a hairy dude.</v>

1304
00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:33.970
<v Speaker 5>You're probably much more animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a.</v>

1305
00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:38.400
<v Speaker 5>There was a recent article that I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>reading today online about chocolate.</v>

1306
00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:43.470
<v Speaker 5>That chocolate is going to be extremely</v>
<v Speaker 5>rare in the future because of our,</v>

1307
00:57:43.471 --> 00:57:45.420
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our overconsumption of chocolate.</v>

1308
00:57:45.421 --> 00:57:48.540
<v Speaker 5>We consume so much chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can't keep up with the production.</v>

1309
00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:50.640
<v Speaker 5>The demand can't keep up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep up with the production</v>

1310
00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:54.340
<v Speaker 3>and they've got a similar product,</v>
<v Speaker 3>project problem that coffee does.</v>

1311
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:57.340
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so genetic problem or genetic problem</v>

1312
00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.840
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1313
00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:01.360
<v Speaker 3>and the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1314
00:58:01.361 --> 00:58:04.840
<v Speaker 3>So chocolate is indigenous to south</v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

1315
00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:08.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee is indigenous to africa.</v>

1316
00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:14.460
<v Speaker 3>A cacao is from latin America and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it's been spread all over the</v>

1317
00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:18.730
<v Speaker 3>world has a narrow genetic base.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1318
00:58:18.731 --> 00:58:22.000
<v Speaker 3>all these tropical crops have these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have these problems.</v>

1319
00:58:22.001 --> 00:58:25.700
<v Speaker 3>The other problem is climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1320
00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:28.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the climate gets warmer,</v>

1321
00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.000
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1322
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:33.520
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the suitable kind of environment for</v>

1323
00:58:33.521 --> 00:58:38.521
<v Speaker 3>these very climate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very temperature intolerant plants,</v>

1324
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:44.990
<v Speaker 3>narrows diseases spread more easily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc. Etc.</v>

1325
00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:45.880
<v Speaker 3>It's a problem</v>

1326
00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:49.660
<v Speaker 5>that is very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you said that coffee can't be grown</v>

1327
00:58:49.661 --> 00:58:50.620
<v Speaker 5>in the United States?</v>

1328
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:51.583
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can.</v>

1329
00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:53.390
<v Speaker 3>Mainly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hawaii is in the United States,</v>

1330
00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:55.340
<v Speaker 3>in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1331
00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:57.710
<v Speaker 3>there is also one farm here in</v>
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>

1332
00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:59.390
<v Speaker 3>really up in santa barbara.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not far.</v>

1333
00:58:59.391 --> 00:59:01.220
<v Speaker 3>You can drive here in santa barbara.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1334
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:02.810
<v Speaker 3>How's their coffee?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Delicious.</v>

1335
00:59:02.830 --> 00:59:03.410
<v Speaker 3>Real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1336
00:59:03.410 --> 00:59:05.660
<v Speaker 3>And heat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he only planted this farm a few</v>

1337
00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:06.441
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No shit.</v>

1338
00:59:06.441 --> 00:59:08.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called good land organics.</v>

1339
00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:12.000

<v Speaker 3>kind of microclimate there.</v>

1342
00:59:15.821 --> 00:59:17.650
<v Speaker 3>There's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go to his farm,</v>

1343
00:59:17.651 --> 00:59:21.170
<v Speaker 3>it can be warmer at night on this farm</v>
<v Speaker 3>than it is during the day because of the</v>

1344
00:59:21.171 --> 00:59:24.260
<v Speaker 3>weird way that the weather works around</v>
<v Speaker 3>their santa barbara's paradise.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's a guy from hearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it came from the here in la and</v>

1363
01:00:04.971 --> 01:00:07.940
<v Speaker 3>he got into agriculture and he bought</v>
<v Speaker 3>this farm that was an avocado farm.</v>

1364
01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:09.950
<v Speaker 3>But then he started planting dragon</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1376
01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:43.490
<v Speaker 3>one of the interesting things about</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee as you plant a coffee seed,</v>

1377
01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:47.960
<v Speaker 3>you don't start to harvest coffee from</v>
<v Speaker 3>between three and seven years after you</v>

1378
01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:49.010
<v Speaker 3>planted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1379
01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:52.870
<v Speaker 5>So he's just now starting to reap the</v>
<v Speaker 5>rewards of all these years and years of</v>

1380
01:00:52.871 --> 01:00:55.610
<v Speaker 5>taking care of plants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is fascinating.</v>

1381
01:00:55.611 --> 01:00:56.444
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

1382
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:58.930
<v Speaker 5>you should grow coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You love it so much.</v>

1383
01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:01.540
<v Speaker 5>Why are you not involved in growing it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1384
01:01:01.541 --> 01:01:04.750
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1388
01:01:12.091 --> 01:01:12.960
<v Speaker 3>at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a farm.</v>

1389
01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:14.910
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've spent the last</v>

1390
01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:20.190
<v Speaker 3>15 or so years just traveling to coffee</v>
<v Speaker 3>farms all over the world,</v>

1391
01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:22.980
<v Speaker 3>working with coffee farmers to get their</v>
<v Speaker 3>quality better and,</v>

1392
01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:23.933
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1393
01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.960
<v Speaker 3>and kind of learn about all this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's kind of a new phenomenon</v>

1394
01:01:27.961 --> 01:01:31.950
<v Speaker 3>to his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his coffee roasting companies that are</v>

1395
01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:35.280
<v Speaker 3>interacting more directly with farmers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and getting the,</v>

1396
01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:38.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting the quality thing really worked</v>

1397
01:01:38.131 --> 01:01:39.150
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>UnderstandIng,</v>

1398
01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what makes coffee grade.</v>

1399
01:01:42.101 --> 01:01:42.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1400
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.680
<v Speaker 5>So most farmers that are growing coffee</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1401
01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:49.610
<v Speaker 5>are they doing it just for a profit or</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's other places where you go in</v>

1402
01:01:49.611 --> 01:01:50.750
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>real artisans.</v>

1403
01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:55.480
<v Speaker 5>Is there a broad variation?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's mostly the first thing because most</v>

1404
01:01:55.481 --> 01:01:56.510
<v Speaker 5>of the artisans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1405
01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:56.750
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1406
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:58.760
<v Speaker 5>it's mostly businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's mostly,</v>

1407
01:01:58.940 --> 01:01:59.773
<v Speaker 5>well it's mostly the</v>

1408
01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:03.020
<v Speaker 3>small farmers struggling to get by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1409
01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.910
<v Speaker 3>so going back to the history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the dutch,</v>

1410
01:02:05.911 --> 01:02:08.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they planted their thing in java and</v>

1411
01:02:08.911 --> 01:02:11.670
<v Speaker 3>they basically enslave the local</v>
<v Speaker 3>population to work on their,</v>

1412
01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:13.690
<v Speaker 3>on their coffee farms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is in the,</v>

1413
01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:15.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the 18th century,</v>

1414
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:17.940
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody was,</v>

1415
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.180
<v Speaker 3>all the european were trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>colonies everywhere.</v>

1416
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:22.310
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1417
01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.570
<v Speaker 3>colonies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the spanish during their colonies in</v>

1418
01:02:24.571 --> 01:02:27.180
<v Speaker 3>central America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the french doing their colonies.</v>

1419
01:02:27.181 --> 01:02:32.181
<v Speaker 3>And in west africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the english we're trying to colonize</v>

1420
01:02:32.341 --> 01:02:33.720
<v Speaker 3>Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1421
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:34.943
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1422
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:37.440
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dutch were colonized east India and</v>

1423
01:02:37.441 --> 01:02:39.090
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kind of enslaved the local</v>

1424
01:02:39.091 --> 01:02:42.240
<v Speaker 3>population to grow coffee and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1425
01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:43.950
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1426
01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:46.160
<v Speaker 3>and so that was sort of a dark period</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1427
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:50.340
<v Speaker 3>in world history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And unfortunately coffee was part of</v>

1428
01:02:50.341 --> 01:02:52.680
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But since then,</v>

1429
01:02:52.681 --> 01:02:53.640
<v Speaker 3>so then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1430
01:02:53.641 --> 01:02:58.110
<v Speaker 3>the enlightenment happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A democracies started to spread around</v>

1431
01:02:58.111 --> 01:03:00.330
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still many of these countries that</v>

1432
01:03:00.331 --> 01:03:05.331
<v Speaker 3>were former former colonies were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had poverty problems like central</v>

1433
01:03:05.521 --> 01:03:06.750
<v Speaker 3>America and stuff like that.</v>

1434
01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the place that I started first started</v>

1435
01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:14.520
<v Speaker 3>working with coffee farmers was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nicaragua and in Nicaragua was formerly</v>

1436
01:03:14.521 --> 01:03:15.510
<v Speaker 3>a colony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1437
01:03:15.511 --> 01:03:16.344
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1438
01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:19.380
<v Speaker 3>and had that problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then they had the revolution.</v>

1439
01:03:19.381 --> 01:03:20.520
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1440
01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:23.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they dissolved a lot of these big farms</v>

1441
01:03:23.761 --> 01:03:28.761
<v Speaker 3>and gave little parcels of land to a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people that used to work on the farm.</v>

1442
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.840
<v Speaker 3>So here you have all these people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to work on a farm that now have</v>

1443
01:03:33.841 --> 01:03:38.841
<v Speaker 3>their little tiny farm of them have</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own and that's cool because then</v>

1444
01:03:39.361 --> 01:03:40.141
<v Speaker 3>they've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1445
01:03:40.141 --> 01:03:42.890
<v Speaker 3>they've got their own business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their farm that's going.</v>

1446
01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:45.960
<v Speaker 3>The problem is it's pretty tough in any</v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

1447
01:03:45.961 --> 01:03:48.720
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the United States or</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nicaragua or anywhere to make a small</v>

1448
01:03:48.721 --> 01:03:51.450
<v Speaker 3>farm profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so in many,</v>

1449
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:54.780
<v Speaker 3>many parts of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got small farmers that are just</v>

1450
01:03:54.781 --> 01:03:56.220
<v Speaker 3>trying to get by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1451
01:03:56.221 --> 01:03:59.100
<v Speaker 3>and put food on their plate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the,</v>

1452
01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.140
<v Speaker 3>one of the great things that coffee that</v>
<v Speaker 3>special coffee companies can do is get</v>

1453
01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:06.660
<v Speaker 3>engaged with those farmers and try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the,</v>

1454
01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.760
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrate the product,</v>

1455
01:04:08.761 --> 01:04:13.761
<v Speaker 3>get people to pay more for it because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>tastes really delicious and it becomes a</v>

1456
01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:17.640
<v Speaker 3>better livelihood for farmers all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1457
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:19.440
<v Speaker 3>all across the world.</v>

1458
01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:22.680
<v Speaker 1>So your friend in santa barbara,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was his name again that owns this</v>

1459
01:04:22.681 --> 01:04:23.970
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>J rescue is his.</v>

1460
01:04:23.971 --> 01:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>And what's the name of the place again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good land organics.</v>

1461
01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:30.540
<v Speaker 1>And so he's just a guy who loves coffee</v>
<v Speaker 1>and decides I'm going to try to grow</v>

1462
01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:32.070
<v Speaker 1>some stuff in santa barbara.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's growing.</v>

1463
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:34.110
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he loves agriculture growing.</v>

1464
01:04:34.111 --> 01:04:35.760
<v Speaker 1>And he thought it was a challenge to</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow coffee,</v>

1465
01:04:35.761 --> 01:04:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he loves coffee too,</v>

1466
01:04:37.591 --> 01:04:40.980
<v Speaker 1>but I think really he loved the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was a challenge to the likes,</v>

1467
01:04:40.981 --> 01:04:45.540
<v Speaker 1>these unusual fruits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it kind of takes a person with a sort</v>

1468
01:04:45.541 --> 01:04:48.750
<v Speaker 1>of a deep commitment to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make something like this take place.</v>

1469
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it's a pretty significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>investment in time and effort before you</v>

1470
01:04:52.891 --> 01:04:54.590
<v Speaker 1>reap any rewards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are those people</v>

1471
01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.110
<v Speaker 3>two in coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even in,</v>

1472
01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:56.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1473
01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:57.573
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1474
01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:02.700
<v Speaker 3>El Salvador and Guatemala.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in Panama in Brazil.</v>

1475
01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:07.390
<v Speaker 3>I know if I know of like amazing farmers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of these places who are like</v>

1476
01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:12.070
<v Speaker 3>focused on like making the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>imaginable coffee.</v>

1477
01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:16.540
<v Speaker 1>So now when you work with these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say if somebody contacts you and say,</v>

1478
01:05:16.541 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 1>peter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what the fuck I'm doing.</v>

1479
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:19.970
<v Speaker 5>Come down here and help me grow some</v>
<v Speaker 5>bitch and coffee.</v>

1480
01:05:19.971 --> 01:05:22.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is your process like?</v>

1481
01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:25.120
<v Speaker 5>Let's say a guy from Hawaii calls you</v>
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>

1482
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:26.650
<v Speaker 5>says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to grow some coffee.</v>

1483
01:05:26.651 --> 01:05:27.484
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what I'm doing.</v>

1484
01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well coffee is kind of an unusual.</v>

1485
01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:32.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hawaii is kind of an unusual situation</v>

1486
01:05:32.931 --> 01:05:35.900
<v Speaker 3>because the university of Hawaii is</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved and they can actually call it</v>

1487
01:05:35.901 --> 01:05:37.490
<v Speaker 3>the university of Hawaii and get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they wouldn't,</v>

1488
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.860
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't need me.</v>

1489
01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:40.360
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So where would they need you at south</v>

1490
01:05:40.361 --> 01:05:43.460
<v Speaker 5>America?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Peru.</v>

1491
01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:45.760
<v Speaker 5>busted for cocaine</v>

1492
01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:47.191
<v Speaker 3>the first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1493
01:05:47.191 --> 01:05:48.700
<v Speaker 3>And Peru.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done a lot of work in Peru and</v>

1494
01:05:48.701 --> 01:05:50.980
<v Speaker 3>Bolivia and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1495
01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:53.110
<v Speaker 3>and not just me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's lots of choice.</v>

1496
01:05:53.111 --> 01:05:55.390
<v Speaker 3>Lots of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people out there and,</v>

1497
01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:57.970
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in fact that the us government</v>

1498
01:05:57.971 --> 01:06:01.660
<v Speaker 3>through usa id is out there trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>give a,</v>

1499
01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:04.990
<v Speaker 3>give good support to these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first thing you do is you teAch,</v>

1500
01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:08.170
<v Speaker 3>teach them to taste coffee and</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazingly,</v>

1501
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:11.770
<v Speaker 3>and some of your listeners may may have</v>
<v Speaker 3>had this experience.</v>

1502
01:06:11.771 --> 01:06:15.660
<v Speaker 3>I've had this experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to wherever and Nicaragua,</v>

1503
01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Costa Rica,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peru or whatever place that's famous for</v>

1504
01:06:19.001 --> 01:06:23.140
<v Speaker 3>its coffee and you go into the hotel and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got nice cafe and the instant</v>

1505
01:06:23.141 --> 01:06:28.141
<v Speaker 3>coffee in the restaurant or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's because a lot of these places,</v>

1506
01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:31.690
<v Speaker 3>people don't drink the coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they grow the coffee,</v>

1507
01:06:31.691 --> 01:06:32.524
<v Speaker 3>but they don't drink it.</v>

1508
01:06:33.110 --> 01:06:34.710
<v Speaker 5>And it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so weird.</v>

1509
01:06:34.711 --> 01:06:36.210
<v Speaker 5>totally weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How's that happen?</v>

1510
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:40.590
<v Speaker 5>Because it's more valuable to export so</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't drink it just because it's</v>

1511
01:06:40.591 --> 01:06:41.610
<v Speaker 5>not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's worth it.</v>

1512
01:06:41.611 --> 01:06:43.680
<v Speaker 5>That's part of the culture that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting now.</v>

1513
01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.290
<v Speaker 5>So not part of the culture yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is,</v>

1514
01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.960
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's part of the agricultural culture,</v>

1515
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:51.060
<v Speaker 5>but it's not part of the consumption</v>
<v Speaker 5>culture.</v>

1516
01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:52.740
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1517
01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:56.950
<v Speaker 3>A Ethiopia is the only place in Brazil</v>
<v Speaker 3>to some extent,</v>

1518
01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:59.950
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they drink coffee as much as they,</v>

1519
01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:01.610
<v Speaker 3>as they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as they exit</v>

1520
01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:03.400
<v Speaker 5>47.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brazil has the same issue.</v>

1521
01:07:03.401 --> 01:07:06.430
<v Speaker 5>The rest of south America where they</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a very limited genetics.</v>

1522
01:07:06.431 --> 01:07:10.360
<v Speaker 5>And is that the same or different?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because Brazil is so much bigger,</v>

1523
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:14.980
<v Speaker 5>but they're more than one variety from</v>
<v Speaker 5>Russia in general.</v>

1524
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:16.300
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1525
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:17.740
<v Speaker 5>and all of these countries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

1526
01:07:17.741 --> 01:07:20.470
<v Speaker 5>are aware of this problem and they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to diversify their genetics.</v>

1527
01:07:20.471 --> 01:07:23.800
<v Speaker 5>So do they contact you through the</v>
<v Speaker 5>coffee website?</v>

1528
01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:26.950
<v Speaker 5>Is specialty coffee association of</v>
<v Speaker 5>America</v>

1529
01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.260
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1530
01:07:28.261 --> 01:07:29.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1531
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:30.640
<v Speaker 3>so in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1532
01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:35.340
<v Speaker 3>about starting in 2000 or so we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1533
01:07:35.341 --> 01:07:39.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we in our group that were affiliated</v>

1534
01:07:39.961 --> 01:07:41.640
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>called the coffee quality institute,</v>

1535
01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:46.260
<v Speaker 3>put had this program called coffee core.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sorta like the peace corps for</v>

1536
01:07:46.261 --> 01:07:49.080
<v Speaker 3>coffee people and guys like me would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

1537
01:07:49.081 --> 01:07:51.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would sign up and volunteer for two</v>

1538
01:07:51.871 --> 01:07:54.630
<v Speaker 3>weeks to serve in a coffee farming</v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

1539
01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:57.540
<v Speaker 3>And if we had a skiLL,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we might have marketing skill or,</v>

1540
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.823
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1541
01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.840
<v Speaker 3>aCcounting or tasting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

1542
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:04.570
<v Speaker 3>my Skill was tasting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would go down,</v>

1543
01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:09.270
<v Speaker 3>I would teach a coffee cooperative in El</v>
<v Speaker 3>Salvador.</v>

1544
01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.350
<v Speaker 3>Do you speak spanish?</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1545
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:11.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1546
01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:14.310
<v Speaker 3>How to taste their coffee and taste it</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we do,</v>

1547
01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:17.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look for things like sweetness and</v>

1548
01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:21.860
<v Speaker 3>flavor and aroma and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just that is like extremely powerful</v>

1549
01:08:21.861 --> 01:08:25.550
<v Speaker 3>because if you're running a coffee farm</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you and you know how to taste it,</v>

1550
01:08:25.551 --> 01:08:28.460
<v Speaker 3>like your buyer is going to taste it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can say,</v>

1551
01:08:28.461 --> 01:08:29.870
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this case,</v>

1552
01:08:29.871 --> 01:08:32.150
<v Speaker 3>it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going To do this,</v>

1553
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to grow it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to dry it this way,</v>

1554
01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:37.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to ferment it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

1555
01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Now when you say grow it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the variables involved in</v>

1556
01:08:40.511 --> 01:08:43.990
<v Speaker 1>changing the flavor of coffee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it just climate or is it the soil</v>

1557
01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:48.490
<v Speaker 1>content or is it something that you add</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the soil the way you water them?</v>

1558
01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:49.181
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1559
01:08:49.181 --> 01:08:49.610
<v Speaker 1>most of them</v>

1560
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:53.680
<v Speaker 3>biggest thing is the climate and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that is determined by altitudes.</v>

1561
01:08:53.681 --> 01:08:57.370
<v Speaker 3>So remember mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mrs. Owen on folgers.</v>

1562
01:08:57.371 --> 01:08:58.720
<v Speaker 3>What was the lady?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1563
01:08:58.780 --> 01:08:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a commercial.</v>

1564
01:08:59.651 --> 01:09:02.440
<v Speaker 3>She used to say mountain grown folgers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh that's right.</v>

1565
01:09:02.441 --> 01:09:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1566
01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and That's because coffee likes to be at</v>

1567
01:09:05.411 --> 01:09:07.840
<v Speaker 3>high altitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in general,</v>

1568
01:09:07.841 --> 01:09:11.770
<v Speaker 3>the higher the altitude the farm is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better the coffee and then.</v>

1569
01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.040
<v Speaker 3>But a farmer has no control over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>altitude of their,</v>

1570
01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:17.320
<v Speaker 3>their farm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they can control is how much</v>

1571
01:09:17.321 --> 01:09:18.910
<v Speaker 3>shade that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1572
01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:23.800
<v Speaker 3>the coffee gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they plant trees next to the coffee</v>

1573
01:09:23.801 --> 01:09:25.570
<v Speaker 3>to actually provide some shade for it.</v>

1574
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have coffee and they're like oak</v>

1575
01:09:27.901 --> 01:09:29.010
<v Speaker 1>trees or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1576
01:09:29.190 --> 01:09:30.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually it's a different.</v>

1577
01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.900
<v Speaker 3>They're different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like latin american indigenous,</v>

1578
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:36.560
<v Speaker 1>something that large leaves shady.</v>

1579
01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:37.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1580
01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:38.493
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1581
01:09:38.650 --> 01:09:43.410
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes it's a fruit tree so they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can get fruit as well from the or other</v>

1582
01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:45.760
<v Speaker 3>j is avocados in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1583
01:09:45.761 --> 01:09:46.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in santa barbara for this.</v>

1584
01:09:47.190 --> 01:09:47.881
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1585
01:09:47.881 --> 01:09:50.720
<v Speaker 1>So he grows his avocado trees and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwiches them inbetween.</v>

1586
01:09:50.790 --> 01:09:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1587
01:09:52.001 --> 01:09:52.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1588
01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:57.360
<v Speaker 3>so the deal is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coffee now a shaded coffee.</v>

1589
01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.850
<v Speaker 3>So coffee evolved under other trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called an understory shrub.</v>

1590
01:10:01.851 --> 01:10:02.620
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1591
01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:05.470
<v Speaker 3>it naturally likes to be protected by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the trees.</v>

1592
01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:07.600
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you take it out and put it in the</v>

1593
01:10:07.601 --> 01:10:09.220
<v Speaker 3>full sun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be more productive.</v>

1594
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:12.610
<v Speaker 3>It'll produce a lot more coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in general that coffee won't be as</v>

1595
01:10:12.611 --> 01:10:16.330
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if a farmer has to like figure out</v>

1596
01:10:16.690 --> 01:10:18.190
<v Speaker 3>the benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1597
01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:20.470
<v Speaker 3>it it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he puts it in shade,</v>

1598
01:10:20.471 --> 01:10:24.430
<v Speaker 3>the coffee will taste better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it won't be as productive.</v>

1599
01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:29.050
<v Speaker 3>So he has to sort of balance and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens in coffee all the</v>

1600
01:10:29.051 --> 01:10:30.020
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1601
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:34.780
<v Speaker 3>it's like the better you make it taste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the less there is of it kind of thing.</v>

1602
01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.610
<v Speaker 3>And so a farmer is always trying to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>that balancing act between having this</v>

1603
01:10:39.611 --> 01:10:42.630
<v Speaker 3>far and be more productive versus having</v>
<v Speaker 3>the quality</v>

1604
01:10:42.730 --> 01:10:45.040
<v Speaker 1>I hire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the ultimate taste expression?</v>

1605
01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.030
<v Speaker 1>What is the move to get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget about no money involved.</v>

1606
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:50.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no financial reward.</v>

1607
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:53.830
<v Speaker 1>You're only trying to achieve the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest taste ever.</v>

1608
01:10:54.090 --> 01:10:55.360
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the way to do that?</v>

1609
01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:01.120
<v Speaker 3>Start with a variety of coffee that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>known for being really good tasting.</v>

1610
01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:04.540
<v Speaker 3>So there's these different varieties of</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee that we talked about.</v>

1611
01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:08.440
<v Speaker 3>Some of them tastes really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them maybe are more disease</v>

1612
01:11:08.441 --> 01:11:10.750
<v Speaker 3>resistant and don't taste as good</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of that.</v>

1613
01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:13.830
<v Speaker 3>So you choose a good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good</v>

1614
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.490
<v Speaker 4>variety to start with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The disease resistant coffees don't</v>

1615
01:11:17.491 --> 01:11:21.150
<v Speaker 4>taste as good as the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what diseases specifically is it</v>

1616
01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:24.390
<v Speaker 4>getting there is a disease in and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>may have heard about it in the news.</v>

1617
01:11:24.391 --> 01:11:28.400
<v Speaker 4>It's actually a big deal right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called coffee rust and it's a</v>

1618
01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:31.260
<v Speaker 4>fungal disease that it makes the coffee</v>
<v Speaker 4>leaves,</v>

1619
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:36.780
<v Speaker 4>get this powder on them that looked</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly like rust makes all the leaves</v>

1620
01:11:36.781 --> 01:11:40.230
<v Speaker 4>fall off and the coffee plant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So is it similar to like,</v>

1621
01:11:40.231 --> 01:11:41.064
<v Speaker 4>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1622
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:41.970
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1623
01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:44.520
<v Speaker 4>what is that disease that was hitting?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>

1624
01:11:44.521 --> 01:11:46.530
<v Speaker 4>that was the bark beetle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking of a bug.</v>

1625
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.410
<v Speaker 4>But it's like that in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that,</v>

1626
01:11:48.411 --> 01:11:49.021
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1627
01:11:49.021 --> 01:11:51.630
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these crops can be susceptible,</v>

1628
01:11:51.631 --> 01:11:56.500
<v Speaker 4>particularly if there's a narrow genetic</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about and what,</v>

1629
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:58.020
<v Speaker 4>what specific?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's this coffee?</v>

1630
01:11:58.021 --> 01:11:59.400
<v Speaker 4>Rust,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what is the,</v>

1631
01:11:59.401 --> 01:12:01.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it all over the world or is.</v>

1632
01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:04.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all over the world except it</v>

1633
01:12:04.201 --> 01:12:07.320
<v Speaker 4>doesn't occur really in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Ethiopia.</v>

1634
01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:12.120
<v Speaker 4>So there's some sort of natural control</v>
<v Speaker 4>happening in Ethiopia that seems to be</v>

1635
01:12:12.121 --> 01:12:13.560
<v Speaker 4>the motherland,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that like.</v>

1636
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:16.860
<v Speaker 4>So if you're a real coffee dork,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going all due respect.</v>

1637
01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:17.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1638
01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:18.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean that in a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it,</v>

1639
01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.590
<v Speaker 4>if you're a real coffee connoisseur,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ethiopia is the spot.</v>

1640
01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:23.880
<v Speaker 4>That's where you want to get your</v>
<v Speaker 4>coffee.</v>

1641
01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:27.720
<v Speaker 4>This for the strongest flavors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the widest variety of flavor and because</v>

1642
01:12:27.721 --> 01:12:28.440
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh gee,</v>

1643
01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.670
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1644
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:33.900
<v Speaker 4>but then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not to qualify that too much.</v>

1645
01:12:33.901 --> 01:12:37.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's amazing coffees from</v>
<v Speaker 4>central America.</v>

1646
01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:41.520
<v Speaker 4>Colombia has some of the most incredible</v>
<v Speaker 4>coffees and they're very different.</v>

1647
01:12:41.521 --> 01:12:42.710
<v Speaker 4>Crazy diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1648
01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.620
<v Speaker 4>In Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

1649
01:12:43.621 --> 01:12:47.520
<v Speaker 4>I really enjoy a coffee from Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just seems to me to have a very</v>

1650
01:12:47.521 --> 01:12:49.200
<v Speaker 4>different taste as well.</v>

1651
01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:53.910
<v Speaker 4>What causes that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it the volcanic ground and be a.</v>

1652
01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:57.000
<v Speaker 4>And then coffee's within Hawaii too can</v>
<v Speaker 4>taste very different.</v>

1653
01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:58.410
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

1654
01:12:58.411 --> 01:13:00.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a maui coffee and I usually like</v>

1655
01:13:00.841 --> 01:13:02.110
<v Speaker 4>to kona coffees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1656
01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:05.790
<v Speaker 4>Kona is the most well known area on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's on the big island,</v>

1657
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:07.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1658
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:08.970
<v Speaker 4>and then it's got altitude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

1659
01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:11.580
<v Speaker 4>once you go up that mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the biggest challenge in,</v>

1660
01:13:11.581 --> 01:13:12.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Hawaii.</v>

1661
01:13:12.731 --> 01:13:15.930
<v Speaker 4>I used to know some people that managed</v>
<v Speaker 4>the coffee farm in molokai,</v>

1662
01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.480
<v Speaker 4>which is a smaller island,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not as much altitude.</v>

1663
01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:21.960
<v Speaker 4>The coffee wasn't as good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's interesting.</v>

1664
01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:22.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a place in,</v>

1665
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:25.920
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Hawaii and on the big island called</v>

1666
01:13:25.921 --> 01:13:27.840
<v Speaker 4>mountain thunder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard of this thing?</v>

1667
01:13:27.930 --> 01:13:28.830
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

1668
01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:31.560
<v Speaker 4>Great coffee from mountain thunder from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big island,</v>

1669
01:13:31.561 --> 01:13:32.820
<v Speaker 4>the big island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really delicious.</v>

1670
01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:33.570
<v Speaker 4>I'll get in there.</v>

1671
01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:34.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyway.</v>

1672
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in general coffees from islands,</v>

1673
01:13:38.161 --> 01:13:41.970
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a Hawaii,</v>

1674
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.550
<v Speaker 4>Jamaica,</v>
<v Speaker 4>places like this,</v>

1675
01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:46.680
<v Speaker 4>they've got a kind of a unique</v>
<v Speaker 4>characteristic.</v>

1676
01:13:46.681 --> 01:13:48.720
<v Speaker 4>You mighT like coffee from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1677
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:50.970
<v Speaker 4>from Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from papa new Guinea.</v>

1678
01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:53.340
<v Speaker 4>And this stuff has four stars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1679
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:55.530
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Indonesia and papa new Guinea.</v>

1680
01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:56.670
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1681
01:13:56.710 --> 01:13:59.960
<v Speaker 4>I really enjoy coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but until this conversation I was a</v>

1682
01:13:59.970 --> 01:14:01.040
<v Speaker 4>full.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1683
01:14:01.041 --> 01:14:01.874
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1684
01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.330
<v Speaker 4>fool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew nothing.</v>

1685
01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:06.600
<v Speaker 4>I relied on too many unscrupulous people</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fill my head with useless</v>

1686
01:14:06.601 --> 01:14:10.200
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what we do in coffee people.</v>

1687
01:14:10.201 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 4>This is what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We get dial in to what people like</v>

1688
01:14:12.530 --> 01:14:13.810
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1689
01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.660
<v Speaker 3>show them other options if they want.</v>

1690
01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:19.130
<v Speaker 5>So to continue what I was asking you</v>
<v Speaker 5>before,</v>

1691
01:14:19.131 --> 01:14:22.640
<v Speaker 5>say if someone contacted you from Let's</v>
<v Speaker 5>say somewhere in south America and they</v>

1692
01:14:22.641 --> 01:14:27.641
<v Speaker 5>wanted you to go over there and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we need to fix our flavor profile,</v>

1693
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:30.760
<v Speaker 5>what would you do besides planting</v>
<v Speaker 5>trees?</v>

1694
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:33.160
<v Speaker 5>Step one is start tasting the coffee</v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves and,</v>

1695
01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:35.720
<v Speaker 5>and how can you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how can you change that taste?</v>

1696
01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:36.991
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1697
01:14:36.991 --> 01:14:39.510
<v Speaker 3>So you can either shade the coffee or</v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1698
01:14:39.570 --> 01:14:40.830
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

1699
01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:43.980
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One easy way that a farmer can change</v>

1700
01:14:43.981 --> 01:14:46.050
<v Speaker 3>the quality of their coffee is how ripe</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets.</v>

1701
01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:50.520
<v Speaker 3>So as coffee gets riper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets sweeter obviously,</v>

1702
01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:55.410
<v Speaker 3>but you don't want it to be too sweet or</v>
<v Speaker 3>else it'll get like overly sweet.</v>

1703
01:14:55.411 --> 01:14:57.910
<v Speaker 3>And also we'll get this kind of rotten</v>
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

1704
01:14:57.911 --> 01:15:00.570
<v Speaker 3>So figuring out dialing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was a farmer I worked with in</v>

1705
01:15:00.571 --> 01:15:02.160
<v Speaker 3>El Salvador,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1706
01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:06.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who like got super focused on how ripe</v>

1707
01:15:06.991 --> 01:15:10.270
<v Speaker 3>she was going to pick her coffee and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>wind up figuring out this is good.</v>

1708
01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:15.350
<v Speaker 3>This is geeky and amaZing is that if she</v>
<v Speaker 3>let the coffee get half of the coffee</v>

1709
01:15:17.651 --> 01:15:20.490
<v Speaker 3>you get to get ripe to where it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the color of blood,</v>

1710
01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:22.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I'm sorry,</v>

1711
01:15:22.530 --> 01:15:24.360
<v Speaker 3>of wine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1712
01:15:24.361 --> 01:15:28.320
<v Speaker 3>Like burgundy color,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then half of the coffee cherries get</v>

1713
01:15:28.321 --> 01:15:30.000
<v Speaker 3>to where they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The color of blood,</v>

1714
01:15:30.150 --> 01:15:32.580
<v Speaker 3>like bright red like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1715
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:35.310
<v Speaker 3>and blended those together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the perfect flavor.</v>

1716
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:36.810
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a dork.</v>

1717
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:39.000
<v Speaker 5>And she dialed in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she's famous.</v>

1718
01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:40.020
<v Speaker 3>They did a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1719
01:15:40.050 --> 01:15:41.150
<v Speaker 3>a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1720
01:15:41.190 --> 01:15:43.170
<v Speaker 3>her name is aida by eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did a,</v>

1721
01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:45.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a piece on her in the new yorker a</v>

1722
01:15:45.061 --> 01:15:48.390
<v Speaker 3>couple years ago because she's become</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rockstar of,</v>

1723
01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:49.470
<v Speaker 3>in the coffee world.</v>

1724
01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:51.860
<v Speaker 5>That's so fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>

1725
01:15:51.861 --> 01:15:54.950
<v Speaker 5>when you sat down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love people that are really industry.</v>

1726
01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:57.770
<v Speaker 5>When someone gets really into something</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you are in a coffee,</v>

1727
01:15:57.771 --> 01:16:00.020
<v Speaker 5>it's very infectious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1728
01:16:00.021 --> 01:16:02.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to like start trying all these</v>

1729
01:16:02.121 --> 01:16:04.790
<v Speaker 5>different flavors now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't want to be hopped up out of</v>

1730
01:16:04.791 --> 01:16:06.570
<v Speaker 5>my fucking mind on caffeine all day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1731
01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:07.940
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to drink that much</v>
<v Speaker 5>either.</v>

1732
01:16:07.941 --> 01:16:08.690
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1733
01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:10.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've already drank five cups of this</v>

1734
01:16:12.650 --> 01:16:14.480
<v Speaker 5>space it out a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's really good,</v>

1735
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:16.130
<v Speaker 5>but if you go to a coffee shop all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

1736
01:16:16.131 --> 01:16:18.410
<v Speaker 5>they can blow your mind with a different</v>
<v Speaker 5>flavor of all times.</v>

1737
01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:22.490
<v Speaker 5>How do you feel about a place like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>chain,</v>

1738

<v Speaker 5>like a big chain?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't even have to mention any names,</v>

1739

<v Speaker 5>sort of generic coffee like does that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>over the place now?</v>

1743
01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you a story.</v>

1744
01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:42.170
<v Speaker 3>So I started in coffee in san diego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was running a coffee shop in the.</v>

1745
01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:43.730
<v Speaker 3>I started in [inaudible] 87.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1746
01:16:43.731 --> 01:16:48.500
<v Speaker 3>So I was a barista in the early nineties</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff and in 1994 we're running this</v>

1747
01:16:48.501 --> 01:16:52.310
<v Speaker 3>coffee shop in san diego and we got word</v>
<v Speaker 3>that starbucks was going to start</v>

1748
01:16:52.311 --> 01:16:55.430
<v Speaker 3>opening stores in san diego and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody freaked out like,</v>

1749
01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:56.690
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're done.</v>

1750
01:16:56.691 --> 01:16:57.830
<v Speaker 3>We might as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1751
01:16:57.831 --> 01:16:59.210
<v Speaker 3>they're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to drive us into the</v>

1752
01:16:59.211 --> 01:17:01.790
<v Speaker 3>ground that the year that starbucks</v>
<v Speaker 3>showed up,</v>

1753
01:17:03.170 --> 01:17:08.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the busiest year that we had and</v>

1754
01:17:08.271 --> 01:17:11.120
<v Speaker 3>every year after that got busier and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

1755
01:17:11.121 --> 01:17:13.820
<v Speaker 3>So the great thing that starbucks has</v>
<v Speaker 3>done and starbucks is,</v>

1756
01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:14.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1757
01:17:14.650 --> 01:17:17.120
<v Speaker 3>they started in the seventies in</v>
<v Speaker 3>seattle,</v>

1758
01:17:17.121 --> 01:17:19.240
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of guys that really liked coffee</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just,</v>

1759
01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.530
<v Speaker 3>they just figured out how to grow this</v>
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

1760
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1761
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:28.550
<v Speaker 3>they taught in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They taught the world how to drink</v>

1762
01:17:28.551 --> 01:17:29.040
<v Speaker 3>coffee.</v>

1763
01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.500
<v Speaker 1>They taught the world to drink coffee in</v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways.</v>

1764
01:17:31.890 --> 01:17:34.140
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to drink coffee in the morning,</v>

1765
01:17:34.141 --> 01:17:36.250
<v Speaker 1>like before I would go to work or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1766
01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.000
<v Speaker 1>like um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys would go to dunkin donuts and I was</v>

1767
01:17:39.001 --> 01:17:41.760
<v Speaker 1>working on construction job sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys are good at dunkin donuts or bring</v>

1768
01:17:41.761 --> 01:17:43.030
<v Speaker 1>back coffees for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1769
01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:46.680
<v Speaker 1>But there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like going to a coffee shop and buying a</v>

1770
01:17:46.681 --> 01:17:51.660
<v Speaker 1>coffee in the middle of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That Sort of starbucks shifted people's</v>

1771
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:55.420
<v Speaker 1>mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shifted their behavior to shit.</v>

1772
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Like brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's,</v>

1773
01:17:57.331 --> 01:17:58.380
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was here earlier.</v>

1776
01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:04.710
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so and so,</v>

1777
01:18:04.711 --> 01:18:06.080
<v Speaker 3>and that's important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1778
01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:07.350
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1779
01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:08.243
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1780
01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:11.690
<v Speaker 3>they've grown and gotten very ubiquitous</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff.</v>

1781
01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:14.610
<v Speaker 3>They've got shops all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not that delicious.</v>

1782
01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:17.550
<v Speaker 3>It's not the best stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1783
01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:19.013
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1784
01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:20.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're trying to be nice.</v>

1785
01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to accuse anybody of</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything but okay,</v>

1786
01:18:23.461 --> 01:18:24.840
<v Speaker 1>let me put it this way in a very nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1787
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Instead of saying something negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>about them,</v>

1788
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:28.740
<v Speaker 1>which I use all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1789
01:18:28.741 --> 01:18:30.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to starbucks hater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1790
01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:32.250
<v Speaker 1>I buy starbucks all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no problem with it.</v>

1791
01:18:32.610 --> 01:18:37.610
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were going to look for a very</v>

1792
01:18:37.771 --> 01:18:41.250
<v Speaker 1>specific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very gourmet type of coffee,</v>

1793
01:18:41.251 --> 01:18:42.090
<v Speaker 1>that's not where you would go.</v>

1794
01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:47.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a bad cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a bad cup of coffee.</v>

1795
01:18:47.361 --> 01:18:50.600
<v Speaker 3>But if you want to go really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to have some of this stuff and</v>

1796
01:18:50.601 --> 01:18:52.880
<v Speaker 3>have it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't go to a starbucks store</v>

1797
01:18:52.881 --> 01:18:54.980
<v Speaker 3>because that's not what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're bringing coffee to the people,</v>

1798
01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:57.710
<v Speaker 3>they're bringing back up pike's peak and</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe a dark roast.</v>

1799
01:18:57.711 --> 01:19:00.050
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I will say though that I've tasted,</v>

1800
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:02.880
<v Speaker 3>I've been to starbucks where they blow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1801
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:07.280
<v Speaker 3>whether they've got access to awesome</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffees and they do have that.</v>

1802
01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:09.680
<v Speaker 3>They do do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not in every store,</v>

1803
01:19:09.681 --> 01:19:10.480
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1820
01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:44.360
<v Speaker 3>We put it in the freezers that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1821
01:19:44.361 --> 01:19:46.180
<v Speaker 3>it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1822
01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:47.750
<v Speaker 3>it can be bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be bad,</v>

1823
01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:50.300
<v Speaker 3>it can be bad if your freezer stinks and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

1824
01:19:50.490 --> 01:19:52.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't seal the bag up well enough.</v>

1825
01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:54.050
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have a stinky freezers then</v>

1826
01:19:54.051 --> 01:19:55.610
<v Speaker 3>you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't ever put anything in there.</v>

1827
01:19:55.611 --> 01:19:56.600
<v Speaker 3>But coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1828
01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.910
<v Speaker 3>One.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other problem is like right now</v>

1829
01:19:58.911 --> 01:20:02.420
<v Speaker 3>we took the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we took the coffee out and it got him to</v>

1830
01:20:02.421 --> 01:20:05.930
<v Speaker 3>room temperature and you take it like if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take a coffee mug that's in the</v>

1831
01:20:05.931 --> 01:20:07.280
<v Speaker 3>freezer out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put it in your thing,</v>

1832
01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 3>it gets All wet on the</v>

1833
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:08.843
<v Speaker 4>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1834
01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:10.860
<v Speaker 4>Then you've got that problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1835
01:20:11.670 --> 01:20:15.720
<v Speaker 4>in general we don't tell people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We generally encourage people not to put</v>

1836
01:20:15.721 --> 01:20:17.730
<v Speaker 4>it in the freezer just and just drink it</v>
<v Speaker 4>fast.</v>

1837
01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.880
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I will say that if I was on,</v>

1838
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:22.410
<v Speaker 4>if I was in Alaska or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1839
01:20:22.411 --> 01:20:25.140
<v Speaker 4>and I could only get a shipment of</v>
<v Speaker 4>coffee once every six months,</v>

1840
01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.730
<v Speaker 4>I would freeze it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1841
01:20:26.731 --> 01:20:27.564
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1842
01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.490
<v Speaker 4>but ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1843
01:20:29.530 --> 01:20:29.971
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1844
01:20:29.971 --> 01:20:31.800
<v Speaker 4>it's not ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you should essentially,</v>

1845
01:20:31.801 --> 01:20:33.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you should essentially do it almost</v>

1846
01:20:33.991 --> 01:20:35.360
<v Speaker 4>like you buy vegetables so you</v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't.</v>

1847
01:20:35.370 --> 01:20:38.610
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always say like you buy bread so you</v>

1848
01:20:38.611 --> 01:20:43.110
<v Speaker 4>should get it and between the time that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's dried and between the time that</v>

1849
01:20:43.111 --> 01:20:46.200
<v Speaker 4>it's roasted and then you drink it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much time should it take place</v>

1850
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:48.690
<v Speaker 4>between the time it's roasted and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time you drink it?</v>

1851
01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.820
<v Speaker 4>So the dry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's essentially,</v>

1852
01:20:50.821 --> 01:20:52.250
<v Speaker 4>it's good for how long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once it's drawn,</v>

1853
01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:54.810
<v Speaker 4>once it's dried and in Nicaragua or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

1854
01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:58.560
<v Speaker 4>then it's usually good for about a year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a year.</v>

1855
01:20:59.310 --> 01:21:02.010
<v Speaker 4>And that's good because it's about once</v>
<v Speaker 4>a year,</v>

1856
01:21:02.011 --> 01:21:02.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coffee,</v>

1857
01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:06.330
<v Speaker 4>coffee harvest happens once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They dry it all,</v>

1858
01:21:06.331 --> 01:21:09.930
<v Speaker 4>they get it together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they stabilize it by drying and then</v>

1859
01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:12.110
<v Speaker 4>they ship it to roasters in the us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1860
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:16.890
<v Speaker 4>So assuming you're in the correct window</v>
<v Speaker 4>then once you get it to a roaster,</v>

1861
01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long after it's roasted,</v>

1862
01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:22.470
<v Speaker 4>should you drink it and does it matter</v>
<v Speaker 4>or should you brew it and does it matter</v>

1863
01:21:22.471 --> 01:21:23.490
<v Speaker 4>how it's stored?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then?</v>

1864
01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.370
<v Speaker 4>Usually the window after roasting is</v>
<v Speaker 4>about two weeks,</v>

1865
01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:27.330
<v Speaker 4>two weeks only.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1866
01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:28.051
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1867
01:21:28.051 --> 01:21:29.970
<v Speaker 4>Like bread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1868
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.290
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

1869
01:21:31.291 --> 01:21:33.480
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and really should roast to order.</v>

1870
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.371
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1871
01:21:34.371 --> 01:21:35.850
<v Speaker 4>and so that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1872
01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:39.600
<v Speaker 4>a good that's interested in coffee</v>
<v Speaker 4>roasting company.</v>

1873
01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:41.400
<v Speaker 4>We have some old coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should just throw it away.</v>

1874
01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no point.</v>

1875
01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:46.110

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right there.</v>

1879
01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:54.080
<v Speaker 4>that's a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a good sign when a,</v>

1880
01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.540
<v Speaker 4>when a roaster cares enough to like put</v>
<v Speaker 4>the roasting date on there.</v>

1881
01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.400
<v Speaker 4>This shit was roasted just a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 4>days ago.</v>

<v Speaker 4>do they roast it when you order it?</v>

1899
01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:40.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good coffee coffee company will do</v>

1900
01:22:40.921 --> 01:22:42.270
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll sort of collect the orders and</v>

1901
01:22:42.271 --> 01:22:45.180
<v Speaker 4>then and then do a roasting day and send</v>
<v Speaker 4>it out all out.</v>

1902
01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:48.510
<v Speaker 4>I have time she'd get it the day after</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was my friend has a coffee company</v>

1903
01:22:48.511 --> 01:22:53.220
<v Speaker 4>called caveman coffee and when you order</v>
<v Speaker 4>it from caveman coffee.com or whatever</v>

01:22:53.221 --> 01:22:54.120
<v Speaker 4>the fuck it is,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's the only way to do it.</v>

1906
01:22:57.151 --> 01:22:57.900
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very cool.</v>

1907
01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:00.570
<v Speaker 4>And they should probably start including</v>
<v Speaker 4>roasted on dance.</v>

1908
01:23:00.571 --> 01:23:02.010
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have roasted on dates,</v>

1909
01:23:02.011 --> 01:23:03.330
<v Speaker 4>but that shit sounds like it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

1910
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:04.320
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1911
01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you're the bag or something,</v>

1912
01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:11.140
<v Speaker 5>I was making a decision about what</v>
<v Speaker 5>coffee to bring you today that made a</v>

1913
01:23:11.261 --> 01:23:12.220
<v Speaker 5>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

1914
01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:16.780
<v Speaker 5>you knocked it out of the park because</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a unique flavor and it's,</v>

1915
01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.900
<v Speaker 5>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's unique and weird.</v>

1916
01:23:19.901 --> 01:23:21.460
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unexpected way.</v>

1917
01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:22.420
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>

1918
01:23:22.421 --> 01:23:24.370
<v Speaker 5>really like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love the smell of it too,</v>

1919
01:23:24.371 --> 01:23:25.940
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are the beans smell like?</v>

1920
01:23:25.950 --> 01:23:28.630
<v Speaker 5>Did they have a unique smell?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you should get a little bit of a</v>

1921
01:23:28.631 --> 01:23:29.800
<v Speaker 5>whiff of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of that,</v>

1922
01:23:29.850 --> 01:23:33.260
<v Speaker 5>a low of that lemonade,</v>
<v Speaker 5>jasmine kind of thing.</v>

1923
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:34.990
<v Speaker 5>Why don't they make sense out of this</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit?</v>

1924
01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:35.860
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1925
01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:37.330
<v Speaker 5>Smell so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1926
01:23:37.331 --> 01:23:38.800
<v Speaker 5>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one time I had to,</v>

1927
01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:42.610
<v Speaker 5>I had to work with an airline to try to</v>
<v Speaker 5>get their coffee tasting better up</v>

1928
01:23:42.611 --> 01:23:43.360
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They.</v>

1929
01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.000
<v Speaker 5>And how did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you go,</v>

1930
01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:47.140
<v Speaker 5>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't that successful in this.</v>

1931
01:23:47.170 --> 01:23:49.480
<v Speaker 5>In this particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't that successful,</v>

1932
01:23:49.481 --> 01:23:52.840
<v Speaker 5>but with all the flight attendants were</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing is they were taking the coffee</v>

1933
01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:56.320
<v Speaker 5>bags and they're putting it in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>bathroom to make it smell a little bit</v>

1934
01:23:56.321 --> 01:23:58.030
<v Speaker 5>better in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the best thing that they couLd</v>

1935
01:23:58.031 --> 01:23:59.140
<v Speaker 5>do with this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>so you just used it as coffee popery</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>

1938
01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.080
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of a good move beCause when</v>

1939
01:24:05.081 --> 01:24:07.270
<v Speaker 5>you smell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if it's crap coffee,</v>

1940
01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you smell the grinds,</v>

1941
01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:12.730
<v Speaker 5>it smells good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can open up a folgers and get it</v>

<v Speaker 5>Good point.</v>

1953
01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:37.420
<v Speaker 5>Bread,</v>
<v Speaker 5>baking all these chocolate.</v>

1954
01:24:37.810 --> 01:24:39.760

01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:43.930
<v Speaker 5>the column browning reactions in</v>
<v Speaker 5>science,</v>

1957
01:24:43.931 --> 01:24:47.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1959
01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:53.410
<v Speaker 5>It's fascinating thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like try eating a piece of raw steak.</v>

1960
01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:54.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>think it's sort of an unsung art form</v>

1966
01:25:08.051 --> 01:25:11.770
<v Speaker 5>that people have figured out how to</v>
<v Speaker 5>cultivate different tastes and flavors</v>

1967
01:25:11.771 --> 01:25:14.860
<v Speaker 5>and all sorts of foods and I'm in in</v>
<v Speaker 5>cooking.</v>

1968
01:25:14.861 --> 01:25:16.960
<v Speaker 5>I became a big fan of cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't.</v>

1969
01:25:16.961 --> 01:25:20.650
<v Speaker 5>I don't really cook very well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I became a big fan of the art form</v>

1970
01:25:20.651 --> 01:25:23.290
<v Speaker 5>of cooking very well when I started</v>
<v Speaker 5>watching anthony bourdain's no</v>

1971
01:25:23.291 --> 01:25:27.100
<v Speaker 5>reservations show and then and becoming</v>
<v Speaker 5>friends with him and getting to know him</v>

1972
01:25:27.101 --> 01:25:29.470
<v Speaker 5>and talking to him about chefs and going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to a restaurant with him,</v>

1973
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.500
<v Speaker 5>which is what was one of the coolest</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking experiences of all time is</v>

1974
01:25:32.501 --> 01:25:32.920
<v Speaker 5>amazing.</v>

1975
01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.010
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1976
01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:37.870
<v Speaker 5>playing basketball with Michael Jordan</v>
<v Speaker 5>or soda and you're hanging out at a</v>

1977
01:25:37.871 --> 01:25:39.590
<v Speaker 5>restaurant with anthony bourdain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>

1978
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:41.000
<v Speaker 5>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1979
01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:44.440
<v Speaker 5>I developed a respect for the art form</v>
<v Speaker 5>from him,</v>

1980
01:25:44.710 --> 01:25:46.990
<v Speaker 5>from watching his show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the art form of cooking,</v>

1981
01:25:46.991 --> 01:25:50.110
<v Speaker 5>and then I started considering it in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>different light instead of thinking</v>

1982
01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:50.501
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1983
01:25:50.501 --> 01:25:52.390
<v Speaker 5>it's nice when people cook good food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1984
01:25:52.391 --> 01:25:54.730
<v Speaker 5>that tastes good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to eat there instead.</v>

1985
01:25:54.731 --> 01:25:57.330
<v Speaker 5>I started thinking of it as art is</v>
<v Speaker 5>artwork right now.</v>

1986
01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:00.610
<v Speaker 5>No different than a song.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No different than a standup comedy</v>

1987
01:26:00.611 --> 01:26:03.130
<v Speaker 5>sketch or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or a cup of coffee.</v>

1988
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:03.740
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

1989
01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1990
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.020
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the art in the creative,</v>

1991
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:08.570
<v Speaker 1>the creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally creative because you're</v>

1992
01:26:08.571 --> 01:26:09.890
<v Speaker 1>creating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1993
01:26:09.891 --> 01:26:11.460
<v Speaker 1>you're growing and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1994
01:26:11.461 --> 01:26:14.120
<v Speaker 1>you're influencing the actual finished</v>
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

1995
01:26:14.121 --> 01:26:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of an overlooked aspect of</v>

1996
01:26:17.121 --> 01:26:17.990
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1997
01:26:18.030 --> 01:26:18.863
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1998
01:26:18.930 --> 01:26:20.030
<v Speaker 3>It totally is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1999
01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:23.730
<v Speaker 3>and people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's nice to hear you talking like that</v>

2000
01:26:23.731 --> 01:26:27.210
<v Speaker 3>because guys in coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we start to talk about how we think</v>

2001
01:26:27.211 --> 01:26:30.330
<v Speaker 3>of coffee as an art form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times people are like,</v>

2002
01:26:30.331 --> 01:26:31.141
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

2003
01:26:31.141 --> 01:26:31.400
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2004
01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.260
<v Speaker 1>People are always looking to call</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit man.</v>

2005
01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.330
<v Speaker 1>People call bullshit too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

2006
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:38.300
<v Speaker 1>It's good thing to call bullshit because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of bullshit out there,</v>

2007
01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:41.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a good thing to call</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit about people's passions.</v>

2008
01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:45.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more interesting to observe</v>
<v Speaker 1>those passions and try to find out what</v>

2009
01:26:45.141 --> 01:26:48.980
<v Speaker 1>it is and if I looked at it on a surface</v>
<v Speaker 1>level and I wasn't really into flavors</v>

2010
01:26:48.981 --> 01:26:52.910
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't have that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>transition in the way I thought about</v>

2011
01:26:52.911 --> 01:26:56.210
<v Speaker 1>flavors because of cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably wouldn't think about it that</v>

2012
01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:59.480
<v Speaker 1>much either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I sit down and talk to a guy</v>

2013
01:26:59.481 --> 01:27:03.530
<v Speaker 1>like you who obviously is dedicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible amount of time to this</v>

2014
01:27:03.531 --> 01:27:05.720
<v Speaker 1>passion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's when it becomes infectious.</v>

2015
01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.800
<v Speaker 1>You kind of understand it.</v>

2016
01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:07.703
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>

2017
01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:08.630
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2018
01:27:08.730 --> 01:27:10.340
<v Speaker 3>and that's the way I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2019
01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:12.300
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of my colleagues think about</v>

2020
01:27:12.301 --> 01:27:15.270
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like how can we make the flavor just</v>

2021
01:27:15.271 --> 01:27:19.590
<v Speaker 3>kind of stopped people in their tracks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can we use coffee and like.</v>

2022
01:27:19.650 --> 01:27:22.530
<v Speaker 3>So like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of mentioned this before,</v>

2023
01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:24.870
<v Speaker 3>when you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're a coffee person,</v>

2024
01:27:24.871 --> 01:27:28.510
<v Speaker 3>when you're a barista,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're interacting with people at like</v>

2025
01:27:28.530 --> 01:27:30.840
<v Speaker 3>this really delicate point in their day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2026
01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:33.420
<v Speaker 3>they don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're coming to your coffee bar.</v>

2027
01:27:34.050 --> 01:27:36.930
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're usually the first person they've</v>

2028
01:27:36.931 --> 01:27:40.770
<v Speaker 3>seen other than their wife or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2029
01:27:41.130 --> 01:27:42.750
<v Speaker 3>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not sure what kind of day</v>

2030
01:27:42.751 --> 01:27:44.550
<v Speaker 3>they're having.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you give them something</v>

2031
01:27:44.551 --> 01:27:46.740
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tastes really good,</v>

2032
01:27:46.770 --> 01:27:50.550
<v Speaker 3>it makes them feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a great thing and if you.</v>

2033
01:27:50.551 --> 01:27:53.880
<v Speaker 3>And if you do that for people a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2034
01:27:53.881 --> 01:27:56.160
<v Speaker 3>you feel like you're doing something</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive for the world.</v>

2035
01:27:56.190 --> 01:27:58.440
<v Speaker 3>So I always get really focused on these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2036
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2037
01:27:59.410 --> 01:28:00.870
<v Speaker 1>you certainly do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2038
01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that anytime you can inspire</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone to,</v>

2039
01:28:04.570 --> 01:28:06.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can inspire someone with your</v>

2040
01:28:06.731 --> 01:28:10.510
<v Speaker 1>passion for something I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm constantly inspired by things that I</v>

2041
01:28:10.511 --> 01:28:12.790
<v Speaker 1>don't want to have anything to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2042
01:28:12.791 --> 01:28:16.600
<v Speaker 1>like there's people that inspire me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I watched that movie,</v>

2043
01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:20.620
<v Speaker 1>jiro dreams of sushi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make sushi or you know,</v>

2044
01:28:20.621 --> 01:28:23.230
<v Speaker 1>I really don't want to eat a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly do.</v>

2045
01:28:23.290 --> 01:28:27.220
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking literally thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying to Japan.</v>

2046
01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and booking a reservation.</v>

2047
01:28:28.721 --> 01:28:31.960
<v Speaker 1>I was going to try to see if I really</v>
<v Speaker 1>should call David Lee roth who lives in</v>

2048
01:28:31.961 --> 01:28:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Japan and in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck jay.</v>

01:28:34.571 --> 01:28:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Does David Lee roth lives in Japan and</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice sword fighting all day.</v>

2050
01:28:39.010 --> 01:28:41.890
<v Speaker 1>David lee ross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the greatest bad motherfuckers to</v>

2051
01:28:41.891 --> 01:28:45.250

<v Speaker 1>Guy walks around and overhauls gives</v>

<v Speaker 1>things and challenging himself.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He lives in fucking Japan in tokyo with</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dog.</v>

01:28:57.550 --> 01:29:01.120
<v Speaker 1>He has an apartment that's fucking David</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee roth man.</v>

2056
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:05.310

<v Speaker 1>apartment like a normal person with a</v>

2057

2060
01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:13.980
<v Speaker 1>There he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's such a cool guy.</v>

2061
01:29:13.981 --> 01:29:15.870
<v Speaker 1>We allowed him to wear sunglasses</v>
<v Speaker 1>indoors.</v>

2062
01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:17.820
<v Speaker 1>I didn't shit on him while we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking that photo.</v>

2063
01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.600
<v Speaker 1>That's an old school thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought those,</v>

2064
01:29:20.630 --> 01:29:23.970
<v Speaker 1>those old school rock stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still wear sunglasses indoors and</v>

2065
01:29:23.971 --> 01:29:24.840
<v Speaker 1>we let them get away with it.</v>

2066
01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:27.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you do that,</v>

2067
01:29:27.491 --> 01:29:30.160
<v Speaker 3>if you go visit jiro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me know and I'll,</v>

2068
01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:33.370
<v Speaker 3>I'll send you some coffee places that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are sort of the equivalent of that.</v>

2069
01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Japan,</v>

2070
01:29:34.631 --> 01:29:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

2071
01:29:35.711 --> 01:29:39.820
<v Speaker 3>So these coffee guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in many ways Japan,</v>

2072
01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:45.490
<v Speaker 3>there's a concept in japanese called</v>
<v Speaker 3>coda and that is like practice,</v>

2073
01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:47.620
<v Speaker 3>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>practice until you're the best in the</v>

2074
01:29:47.621 --> 01:29:50.590
<v Speaker 3>world and keep practicing and keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting it wrong,</v>

2075
01:29:50.591 --> 01:29:52.060
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to get better all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2076
01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:53.193
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

2077
01:29:53.370 --> 01:29:56.620
<v Speaker 3>it's evident in martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's evident in jiro dreams of sushi.</v>

2078
01:29:56.650 --> 01:29:57.710
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he's like,</v>

2079
01:29:57.730 --> 01:29:58.410
<v Speaker 3>focus</v>

2080
01:29:58.410 --> 01:30:00.840
<v Speaker 1>was what they were calling each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that the phrase?</v>

2081
01:30:00.841 --> 01:30:02.100
<v Speaker 1>This phrase?</v>

2153
01:33:11.810 --> 01:33:14.700
<v Speaker 1>He designed this show gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2154
01:33:14.930 --> 01:33:15.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a very common name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2155
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:18.080
<v Speaker 1>but he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lives in chicago.</v>

2156
01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the best pool cue manufacturers</v>

2157
01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:23.270
<v Speaker 1>are artists I should say in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

2158
01:33:23.370 --> 01:33:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the cognitive one.</v>

2159
01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had them designed based on.</v>

2160
01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:33.520
<v Speaker 1>He hired these engineers to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the exact perfect taper and the</v>

2161
01:33:34.431 --> 01:33:37.160
<v Speaker 1>right combinations of woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mostly uses ebony.</v>

2162
01:33:37.161 --> 01:33:40.370
<v Speaker 1>He used all kinds of different Woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time he uses ebony with</v>

2163
01:33:40.371 --> 01:33:45.371
<v Speaker 1>a maple shaft and certain woolman dried</v>
<v Speaker 1>aged wood because the wood has to be</v>

2164
01:33:45.621 --> 01:33:47.650
<v Speaker 1>dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can camp any water in the water,</v>

2165
01:33:47.651 --> 01:33:49.580
<v Speaker 1>a little move as it dries and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes,</v>

2166
01:33:49.581 --> 01:33:51.280
<v Speaker 1>so they have to cut the wood down.</v>

2167
01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:54.740
<v Speaker 1>He starts out in a big block and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly cut it down over long periods of</v>

2168
01:33:54.741 --> 01:33:58.040
<v Speaker 1>time until it becomes a doll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could make a qwiff because you have</v>

2169
01:33:58.041 --> 01:33:59.990
<v Speaker 1>to allow for the wood to move as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>dries.</v>

2170
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Second guitar maker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

2171
01:34:01.431 --> 01:34:04.490
<v Speaker 1>very similar and there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference amongst pool</v>

2172
01:34:04.491 --> 01:34:07.610
<v Speaker 1>players in woods and how they perform on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a table.</v>

2173
01:34:07.611 --> 01:34:09.560
<v Speaker 1>If they have a different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a maple,</v>

2174
01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:14.280
<v Speaker 1>a forearm of the queue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a joint in most cues and then</v>

2175
01:34:14.290 --> 01:34:17.660
<v Speaker 1>the shaft is almost always maple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The maple forum will be very Different</v>

2176
01:34:17.661 --> 01:34:21.920
<v Speaker 1>than a coco bolo for like a springiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2177
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:23.660
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's maple is a little bit more</v>

2178
01:34:23.661 --> 01:34:27.120
<v Speaker 1>gentle and forgiving and a cocoa elbows</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little more dense than ebony is</v>

2179
01:34:27.130 --> 01:34:30.170
<v Speaker 1>denser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still having also is heavier so it has</v>

2180
01:34:30.171 --> 01:34:33.200
<v Speaker 1>like a more forward balance to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The middle of the queue will hold a lot</v>

2181
01:34:33.201 --> 01:34:35.660
<v Speaker 1>of weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so sometimes people who prefer a maple</v>

2182
01:34:35.661 --> 01:34:37.160
<v Speaker 1>queue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go with the steel joint.</v>

2183
01:34:37.190 --> 01:34:40.550
<v Speaker 1>So the steel in the middle sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>access like a pendulum because the</v>

2184
01:34:40.551 --> 01:34:44.300
<v Speaker 1>weight is forward on the queue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the balance of the cubes is very</v>

2185
01:34:44.301 --> 01:34:46.700
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also an artist in thing.</v>

2186
01:34:46.730 --> 01:34:49.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's just like this coffee</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and a lot of ways is the people</v>

2187
01:34:49.941 --> 01:34:52.460
<v Speaker 1>that are really into it are really into</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and they,</v>

2188
01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:54.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys who make pool cues,</v>

2189
01:34:54.651 --> 01:34:57.590
<v Speaker 1>like there's they're artists and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a lot of,</v>

2190
01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:00.770
<v Speaker 1>especially guys like joe gold do it on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high end level.</v>

2191
01:35:00.771 --> 01:35:02.300
<v Speaker 1>They're making a functional piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>

2192
01:35:02.301 --> 01:35:04.820
<v Speaker 1>It's very beautiful to look at as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2193
01:35:04.821 --> 01:35:08.450
<v Speaker 1>This is joe's work here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>with no rap,</v>

2197
01:35:17.450 --> 01:35:21.140

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2265
01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:12.090

<v Speaker 3>people will wind up dying.</v>

2266
01:38:12.091 --> 01:38:13.260
<v Speaker 3>They would die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are crazy.</v>

2267
01:38:13.410 --> 01:38:15.990
<v Speaker 3>We need to limit the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>competition that people were actually</v>

2268
01:38:15.991 --> 01:38:17.160
<v Speaker 3>allowed to involve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's true.</v>

2269
01:38:17.161 --> 01:38:21.540
<v Speaker 3>So this is the coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coffee competItions that we do and</v>

2270
01:38:21.541 --> 01:38:22.850
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2271
01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:25.940
<v Speaker 3>there's a barista thing where they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>making espresso.</v>

2272
01:38:25.950 --> 01:38:28.830
<v Speaker 3>There's a brewer's thing where there</v>
<v Speaker 3>brewing coffee,</v>

2273
01:38:28.831 --> 01:38:30.690
<v Speaker 3>there's a tasters thing where they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2274
01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:34.980
<v Speaker 3>they're competing on how well they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>taste coffee and discern the differences</v>

2275
01:38:35.010 --> 01:38:37.950
<v Speaker 3>between coffee and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there is a coffee version of the</v>

2276
01:38:37.951 --> 01:38:38.784
<v Speaker 3>Somalia?</v>

2277
01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:39.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

2278
01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:42.100
<v Speaker 3>So you drank this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would know this is from Ethiopia if,</v>

2279
01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:44.520
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't drink this,</v>

2280
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:48.360
<v Speaker 3>if you drank this and you called</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself a coffee pro and you weren't</v>

2281
01:38:48.361 --> 01:38:50.430
<v Speaker 3>able to identify it as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a chef,</v>

2282
01:38:50.431 --> 01:38:52.290
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a major.</v>

2283
01:38:52.810 --> 01:38:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be a faker.</v>

2284
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:54.743
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>

2285
01:38:54.930 --> 01:38:57.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is one of the classic</v>

2286
01:38:57.271 --> 01:39:00.540
<v Speaker 3>origins of coffee that you need to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to identify what could you get</v>

2287
01:39:00.541 --> 01:39:02.760
<v Speaker 3>confused by?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were really worried,</v>

2288
01:39:02.761 --> 01:39:05.790
<v Speaker 3>like if you had a bet your mortgage on</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not you could nail one,</v>

2289
01:39:05.791 --> 01:39:07.410
<v Speaker 3>which would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would be a tricky one?</v>

2290
01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:10.620
<v Speaker 3>The differences between what coffee's</v>
<v Speaker 3>still in central America.</v>

2291
01:39:10.621 --> 01:39:15.030
<v Speaker 3>They get really new because I mean think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about that central american isthmus</v>

2292
01:39:15.031 --> 01:39:15.864
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2293
01:39:16.110 --> 01:39:17.670
<v Speaker 3>El Salvador,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guatemala,</v>

2294
01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:18.990
<v Speaker 3>Costa Rica,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nicaragua,</v>

2295
01:39:18.991 --> 01:39:21.150
<v Speaker 3>there all right next to each other and</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you said,</v>

2296
01:39:21.450 --> 01:39:22.120
<v Speaker 3>like the same.</v>

2297
01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:23.860

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2298
01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:28.880
<v Speaker 3>So those coffees tastes very similar but</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a coffee from another great coffee</v>

<v Speaker 3>Ethiopia.</v>

01:40:07.111 --> 01:40:10.080
<v Speaker 3>stuff though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you took some plants from that area</v>

2311
01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:13.200
<v Speaker 3>and then moved them to Hawaii?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great question.</v>

2312
01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:15.240
<v Speaker 3>You usually get into the coffee</v>
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

2313
01:40:15.241 --> 01:40:17.970
<v Speaker 3>You're asking the right questions in</v>
<v Speaker 3>general.</v>

2314
01:40:17.970 --> 01:40:19.830
<v Speaker 3>We don't have very many examples of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2315
01:40:20.090 --> 01:40:22.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because only recently have people</v>

2316
01:40:22.531 --> 01:40:24.390
<v Speaker 3>started to move coffee around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2317
01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:29.810
<v Speaker 3>but I tasted once a coffee from a farm</v>
<v Speaker 3>in El Salvador that had the kenyan</v>

2318
01:40:31.410 --> 01:40:33.440
<v Speaker 3>coffees from this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2319
01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:37.140
<v Speaker 3>this place in neary planted on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

2320
01:40:37.141 --> 01:40:41.250
<v Speaker 3>at the time I didn't know anything but I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was tasting this coffee and I accused</v>

2321
01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:45.000
<v Speaker 3>the guy that was working in my lab with</v>
<v Speaker 3>me of making a mistake.</v>

2322
01:40:45.330 --> 01:40:47.610
<v Speaker 3>It tastes like kenyan coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huh?</v>

2323
01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:48.940
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2324
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:54.000
<v Speaker 3>it's the varieties that have grown to</v>
<v Speaker 3>these places that are in many ways</v>

2325
01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:56.980
<v Speaker 3>determine these flavors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also a farm in,</v>

2326
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:58.743
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2327
01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:03.700
<v Speaker 3>in Panama that was kind of accidentally</v>
<v Speaker 3>planted with some coffees from Ethiopia</v>

2328
01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:05.860
<v Speaker 3>and the coffee tastes like ethiopian</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee.</v>

2329
01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:06.731
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2330
01:41:06.731 --> 01:41:09.940
<v Speaker 1>So is there a similarity in the climate?</v>

2331
01:41:10.450 --> 01:41:11.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the climate is the same and they've.</v>

2332
01:41:11.970 --> 01:41:13.990
<v Speaker 3>Coffee variety is the same because</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember,</v>

2333
01:41:13.991 --> 01:41:16.390
<v Speaker 3>all these thousands of varieties that</v>
<v Speaker 3>exist in the world,</v>

2334
01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:18.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if in,</v>

2335
01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:19.810
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in yoga chef,</v>

2336
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.640
<v Speaker 3>they grow three different varieties</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2337
01:41:22.570 --> 01:41:25.930
<v Speaker 3>If you go to yoga chef and ask a farmer</v>
<v Speaker 3>what varieties of coffee he's growing,</v>

2338
01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:30.550
<v Speaker 3>he's got a choice of three m and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>different from anywhere else in the</v>

2339
01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:32.350
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those they look different.</v>

2340
01:41:32.351 --> 01:41:33.600
<v Speaker 3>You can see that they're different,</v>

2341
01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:35.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those little tiny ones that we</v>

2342
01:41:35.250 --> 01:41:36.580
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the,</v>

2343
01:41:36.970 --> 01:41:37.850
<v Speaker 1>it's called [inaudible].</v>

2344
01:41:38.210 --> 01:41:40.630
<v Speaker 3>A mocha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2345
01:41:40.631 --> 01:41:42.690
<v Speaker 3>Mocha is the variety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So mlk,</v>

2346
01:41:42.691 --> 01:41:45.790
<v Speaker 3>k a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This came from Yemen somehow and made it</v>

2347
01:41:45.791 --> 01:41:47.110
<v Speaker 3>to Hawaii and they planned it.</v>

2348
01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:50.940
<v Speaker 1>That's rusty's hawaiian by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really delicious and really</v>

2349
01:41:50.941 --> 01:41:52.080
<v Speaker 1>tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like little,</v>

2350
01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:54.980
<v Speaker 1>they're like seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like bbs.</v>

2351
01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2352
01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:56.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way to describe it.</v>

2353
01:41:56.851 --> 01:41:57.870
<v Speaker 1>On pbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2354
01:41:58.290 --> 01:42:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how often do you travel around the</v>

2355
01:42:01.111 --> 01:42:05.010
<v Speaker 1>world helping people define the flavors</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their coffees?</v>

2356
01:42:05.210 --> 01:42:07.480
<v Speaker 3>Well now I have a kid so I don't do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>as much anymore,</v>

2357
01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:09.650
<v Speaker 3>but there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a decade there where I would</v>

2358
01:42:09.651 --> 01:42:13.100
<v Speaker 3>travel a one year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 days in a year.</v>

2359
01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:13.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it waS,</v>

2360
01:42:13.730 --> 01:42:14.580
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2361
01:42:14.581 --> 01:42:17.150
<v Speaker 3>I was just bugged out of your mind doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee.</v>

2362
01:42:17.210 --> 01:42:18.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2363
01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Tasting it more than a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2364
01:42:20.841 --> 01:42:24.880
<v Speaker 3>when we're tasting coffee will spit it</v>
<v Speaker 3>out so you don't get too fucked up.</v>

2365
01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:26.990
<v Speaker 3>They just taste it and spit it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

2366
01:42:26.991 --> 01:42:28.910
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel bad about spitting it out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes?</v>

2367
01:42:29.210 --> 01:42:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't,</v>

2368
01:42:30.411 --> 01:42:32.510
<v Speaker 3>if stute delicious and you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2369
01:42:32.511 --> 01:42:33.440
<v Speaker 3>you can just drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drink it.</v>

2370
01:42:33.441 --> 01:42:35.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2371
01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:36.313
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2372
01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:38.690
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of.</v>

2373
01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:40.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not just me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of,</v>

2374
01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:42.560
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of people out there right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2375
01:42:42.561 --> 01:42:45.350
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was chatting with a guy and in Kenya</v>

2376
01:42:45.351 --> 01:42:47.650
<v Speaker 3>this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now what can be done</v>

2377
01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:52.700
<v Speaker 1>about the soil itself is their</v>
<v Speaker 1>composting then improves the health of</v>

2378
01:42:52.831 --> 01:42:53.410
<v Speaker 1>the plant.</v>

2379
01:42:53.410 --> 01:42:55.140
<v Speaker 3>Question that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2380
01:42:55.141 --> 01:42:59.550
<v Speaker 3>that one of the issues with coffee is</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take all this coffee out from a farm</v>

2381
01:42:59.551 --> 01:43:02.820
<v Speaker 3>and wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kenya and you bring the coffee here,</v>

2382
01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:05.280
<v Speaker 3>but you got to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to be bringing stuff back to the</v>

2383
01:43:05.281 --> 01:43:09.360
<v Speaker 3>soil all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And otherwise the soil will be depleted.</v>

2384
01:43:09.361 --> 01:43:12.060
<v Speaker 3>So getting nutrients back in the soil is</v>
<v Speaker 3>really important.</v>

2385
01:43:12.061 --> 01:43:14.130
<v Speaker 3>Composting is a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good to have,</v>

2386
01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:19.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>access to manure if you can from cattle</v>

2387
01:43:19.801 --> 01:43:21.760
<v Speaker 3>or chickens or whatever that they put</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2388
01:43:21.761 --> 01:43:22.594
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot</v>

2389
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:26.720
<v Speaker 1>preferred type of manure that you use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the soil because I know</v>

2390
01:43:26.721 --> 01:43:29.750
<v Speaker 1>people are really in a chicken shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicken shit is great because we have</v>

2391
01:43:29.751 --> 01:43:32.810
<v Speaker 1>chickens and people asking us for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2392
01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:34.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's like,</v>

2393
01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:36.510
<v Speaker 3>it's like dynamite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That stuff.</v>

2394
01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:38.410
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People ask me for shit.</v>

2395
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what about like rotten vegetables?</v>

2396
01:43:42.610 --> 01:43:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Most any</v>

2397
01:43:44.130 --> 01:43:48.150
<v Speaker 3>good coffee farm will have a gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 3>compost heap that they,</v>

2398
01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:53.240
<v Speaker 3>that they have the coffee pulp and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that from when they process the coffee</v>

2399
01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:56.240
<v Speaker 3>plus manure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken manure,</v>

2400
01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:57.170
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of stuff</v>

2401
01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:01.530
<v Speaker 1>and this is all sort of leave and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like piled up and then it's evenly</v>

2402
01:44:01.531 --> 01:44:02.790
<v Speaker 1>distributed over the farm</v>

2403
01:44:03.090 --> 01:44:05.220
<v Speaker 3>and then they have to carry it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So farmers,</v>

2404
01:44:05.221 --> 01:44:10.221
<v Speaker 3>we'll put it in a bag on their back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk up these mountains and like put,</v>

2405
01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:16.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two or three kilograms of manure on each</v>

2406
01:44:16.201 --> 01:44:19.530
<v Speaker 3>coffee plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now one coffee plant will produce about</v>

2407
01:44:19.531 --> 01:44:23.700
<v Speaker 3>a pound of coffee in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this gives you an idea how much work</v>

2408
01:44:23.701 --> 01:44:24.090
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

2409
01:44:24.090 --> 01:44:25.500
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2410
01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:29.250
<v Speaker 1>one coffee plant produces a full bag of</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee in one year.</v>

2411
01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:30.320
<v Speaker 1>In a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2412
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:32.820
<v Speaker 1>So why isn't coffee a million dollars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great question.</v>

2413
01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:36.510
<v Speaker 1>What would happen if coffee can be grown</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States?</v>

2414
01:44:36.511 --> 01:44:38.220
<v Speaker 1>It is probably would cost a million</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

2415
01:44:38.490 --> 01:44:38.950
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>YoU know,</v>

2416
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:40.620
<v Speaker 3>that's why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight.</v>

2417
01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:45.090
<v Speaker 3>This was probably pretty expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This straight hawaiian coffee.</v>

2418
01:44:45.650 --> 01:44:47.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not cheap at all.</v>

2419
01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:48.830
<v Speaker 1>It's very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like,</v>

2420
01:44:49.010 --> 01:44:49.843
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget,</v>

2421
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:50.610
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say</v>

2422
01:44:50.610 --> 01:44:51.391
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

2423
01:44:51.391 --> 01:44:54.750
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of money and that's why it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's because it's incredibly</v>

2424
01:44:54.751 --> 01:44:55.680
<v Speaker 3>laboR intensive.</v>

2425
01:44:55.780 --> 01:44:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

2426
01:44:57.100 --> 01:45:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue that they're having with a lot</v>

2427
01:45:01.481 --> 01:45:04.030
<v Speaker 1>of farms is the depletion of the soil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

2428
01:45:04.570 --> 01:45:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Minerally deficient soils had been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been an issue with farmers since</v>

2429
01:45:07.691 --> 01:45:10.300
<v Speaker 1>the 19 twenties when they first started</v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing.</v>

2430
01:45:10.490 --> 01:45:11.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2431
01:45:11.190 --> 01:45:12.870
<v Speaker 3>and then so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2432
01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:15.070
<v Speaker 3>and this is a big challenge for all</v>
<v Speaker 3>agriculture but,</v>

2433
01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:19.880
<v Speaker 3>but coffee is no different how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>maintain fertility in your soil without,</v>

2434
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:23.630
<v Speaker 3>because it takes a lot of work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of labor to get stuff back.</v>

2435
01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:24.980
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2436
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:28.560
<v Speaker 3>so chemical fertilizers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another option for,</v>

2437
01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:31.730
<v Speaker 3>for farmers they use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's a problem too because It</v>

2438
01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:33.470
<v Speaker 3>takes energy to make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2439
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:37.550
<v Speaker 3>they burn gas basically to make npk</v>
<v Speaker 3>fertilizer,</v>

2440
01:45:37.551 --> 01:45:42.230
<v Speaker 3>which is chemical fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So organic farms don't use that kind of</v>

2441
01:45:42.231 --> 01:45:44.090
<v Speaker 3>fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make their own with compost,</v>

2442
01:45:44.091 --> 01:45:47.810
<v Speaker 3>but it's so much effort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a huge lead,</v>

2443
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:49.790
<v Speaker 3>expensive undertaking to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's a challenge.</v>

2444
01:45:49.791 --> 01:45:52.220
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that we face and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talk about a lot in coffee.</v>

2445
01:45:52.270 --> 01:45:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Is there a variation in the flavor of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>plant that's been fertilized with the</v>

2446
01:45:56.500 --> 01:46:00.670
<v Speaker 1>chemical feRtilizer or synthetic or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you call it as versed as</v>

2447
01:46:00.671 --> 01:46:01.900
<v Speaker 1>opposed to compost?</v>

2448
01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:03.480
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as the.</v>

2449
01:46:03.481 --> 01:46:07.410
<v Speaker 3>As long as the plant is healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's possible to make it healthy in both</v>

2450
01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:09.570
<v Speaker 3>those ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if the plant's healthy,</v>

2451
01:46:09.571 --> 01:46:10.710
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna make good coffee,</v>

2452
01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:14.970
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like a huge difference in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chemical process itself.</v>

2453
01:46:14.971 --> 01:46:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2454
01:46:15.690 --> 01:46:17.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean you obviously have to burn things</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to.</v>

2455
01:46:18.570 --> 01:46:19.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2456
01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:20.641
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2457
01:46:20.641 --> 01:46:21.640
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there are,</v>

2458
01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:23.760
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of middle ground too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2459
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.150
<v Speaker 3>I would say most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most good farmers or many good farmers</v>

2460
01:46:27.151 --> 01:46:31.290
<v Speaker 3>use a little bit of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of synthetic fertilizer and a little bit</v>

2461
01:46:31.291 --> 01:46:32.690
<v Speaker 3>of compost as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they kind of</v>

2462
01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:35.160
<v Speaker 1>multivitamins with a good diet.</v>

2463
01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:38.840
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what it's like using</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical fertilizer is the same as using</v>

2464
01:46:38.841 --> 01:46:39.840
<v Speaker 3>vitamin supplements.</v>

2465
01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:42.290
<v Speaker 1>You ever heard of a guy named dr joel</v>
<v Speaker 1>wallach?</v>

2466
01:46:42.380 --> 01:46:45.050
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a doctor who wrote a book called</v>

2467
01:46:45.051 --> 01:46:48.290
<v Speaker 1>dead doctors don't lie and saw about</v>
<v Speaker 1>minerally sufficient,</v>

2468
01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:53.360
<v Speaker 1>insufficient soils and about a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>epidemic we have with minerally</v>

2469
01:46:53.701 --> 01:46:55.110
<v Speaker 1>deficient diets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2470
01:46:55.111 --> 01:46:56.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much of what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fuckery.</v>

2471
01:46:57.050 --> 01:46:58.610
<v Speaker 1>I need to really probably talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

2472
01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:00.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to dr rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patrick about it.</v>

2473
01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Choose one of the guests that we have on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast.</v>

2474
01:47:03.091 --> 01:47:06.660
<v Speaker 1>I'll say an actual scientist and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she really understands what she's</v>

2475
01:47:06.661 --> 01:47:10.410
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy was talking about areas in</v>

2476
01:47:10.411 --> 01:47:14.040
<v Speaker 1>the world where people live to be much</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer or live to me much older and</v>

2477
01:47:14.041 --> 01:47:17.460
<v Speaker 1>we're healthier and had darker hair</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer and that it was because they were</v>

2478
01:47:17.461 --> 01:47:22.461
<v Speaker 1>getting something called glacial milk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the runoff like water from</v>

2479
01:47:23.250 --> 01:47:26.010
<v Speaker 1>glaciers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually had like a milky quality</v>

2480
01:47:26.011 --> 01:47:31.011
<v Speaker 1>to it because it was so minerally rich</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now as their areas like that where</v>

2481
01:47:31.201 --> 01:47:34.790
<v Speaker 1>they grow coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which minerally rich coffee people</v>

2482
01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:38.050
<v Speaker 3>like the legend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of legends and coffee.</v>

2483
01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:38.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2484
01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:41.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean about special areas that make</v>
<v Speaker 3>special coffee.</v>

2485
01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:42.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you.</v>

2486
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:47.120
<v Speaker 3>You mentioned earlier volcanic soils,</v>
<v Speaker 3>places that have volcanic soil that the</v>

2487
01:47:47.121 --> 01:47:48.680
<v Speaker 3>farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if their coffee is great,</v>

2488
01:47:48.681 --> 01:47:50.960
<v Speaker 3>they will attribute it to all of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2489
01:47:51.410 --> 01:47:56.060
<v Speaker 3>But so far there's not a lot of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual evidence to support any of that.</v>

2490
01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:57.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2491
01:47:58.250 --> 01:48:01.760
<v Speaker 3>all it is is we know and we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>discovering these things all the time.</v>

2492
01:48:01.761 --> 01:48:04.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like what is the magic?</v>

2493
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:07.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of mixture of the right</v>
<v Speaker 3>variety,</v>

2494
01:48:07.161 --> 01:48:09.920
<v Speaker 3>the right climate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right kind of soil composition,</v>

2495
01:48:09.921 --> 01:48:11.750
<v Speaker 3>the right kind of husbandry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this,</v>

2496
01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:14.110
<v Speaker 3>it's so many factors together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2497
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:16.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it makes sense to isolate</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing.</v>

2498
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:21.830
<v Speaker 3>Another thing that people always ask me</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like if they're growing pine trees on</v>

2499
01:48:21.831 --> 01:48:25.160
<v Speaker 3>the farm with their green coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you tease the pine trees in the,</v>

2500
01:48:25.730 --> 01:48:26.630
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2501
01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:28.250
<v Speaker 3>in the coffee itself.</v>

2502
01:48:29.090 --> 01:48:32.190
<v Speaker 3>And I'm pretty sure that there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way that,</v>

2503
01:48:32.191 --> 01:48:32.780
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2504
01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:34.310
<v Speaker 3>I've never experienced that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2505
01:48:34.490 --> 01:48:35.323
<v Speaker 3>but people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2506
01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:38.900
<v Speaker 3>these legends kind of come up are around</v>
<v Speaker 3>cost and you do,</v>

2507
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:43.270
<v Speaker 3>you do taste amazing things in coffee</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are inexplicably,</v>

2508
01:48:43.290 --> 01:48:47.480
<v Speaker 3>like that coffee that we just drank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The definitely smells like lemons,</v>

2509
01:48:47.481 --> 01:48:48.171
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2510
01:48:48.171 --> 01:48:49.760
<v Speaker 3>it smells like a tea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2511
01:48:49.761 --> 01:48:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Like lemon tea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2512
01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:52.850
<v Speaker 3>And it tastes good even when it cools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2513
01:48:52.851 --> 01:48:54.280
<v Speaker 3>taste better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I noticed that too.</v>

2514
01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:56.510
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2515
01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:58.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the case with a lot of</v>

2516
01:48:58.821 --> 01:48:59.440
<v Speaker 3>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2517
01:48:59.440 --> 01:48:59.691
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2518
01:48:59.691 --> 01:49:01.040
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

2519
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:03.950
<v Speaker 3>What's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well coffee is,</v>

2520
01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:08.720
<v Speaker 3>we'll continue to extract over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whIle it's been sitting in this,</v>

2521
01:49:08.810 --> 01:49:10.760
<v Speaker 3>in this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's continuing to extract.</v>

2522
01:49:10.761 --> 01:49:13.820
<v Speaker 3>It's going from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was maybe 18 percent when I</v>

2523
01:49:13.821 --> 01:49:18.290
<v Speaker 3>pledged it in terms of percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 3>extraction and it keeps on going up as</v>

2524
01:49:18.291 --> 01:49:21.080
<v Speaker 3>it sits and so it'll evolve in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>flavor.</v>

2525
01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:24.350
<v Speaker 3>The other thing that changes is you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2526
01:49:24.770 --> 01:49:28.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's this thing called habituation</v>

2527
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.390
<v Speaker 3>in tasting things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2528
01:49:32.810 --> 01:49:36.650
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't completely hip to this until I</v>
<v Speaker 3>taste scientist.</v>

2529
01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:37.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2530
01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:39.920
<v Speaker 3>he did this demonstration for me and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>did it with wine.</v>

2531
01:49:39.921 --> 01:49:42.590
<v Speaker 3>He said he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gave me a glass of this,</v>

2532
01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:47.680
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a white wine from a New Zealand and he</v>

2533
01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:49.770
<v Speaker 3>had me taste it and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2534
01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:52.690
<v Speaker 3>you taste that green bell pepper note in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2535
01:49:52.691 --> 01:49:54.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the thing that they say about</v>

2536
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:55.690
<v Speaker 3>wines from this area and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2537
01:49:55.691 --> 01:49:56.710
<v Speaker 3>I can taste it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he says okay,</v>

2538
01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:00.460
<v Speaker 3>and then he gave me a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual green bell pepper and he said,</v>

2539
01:50:00.490 --> 01:50:01.690
<v Speaker 3>eat that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I did.</v>

2540
01:50:02.610 --> 01:50:03.251
<v Speaker 3>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2541
01:50:03.251 --> 01:50:05.740
<v Speaker 3>now taste the wine again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I tasted the wine again and it</v>

2542
01:50:05.741 --> 01:50:07.240
<v Speaker 3>tastes Like a completely different wine.</v>

2543
01:50:08.410 --> 01:50:09.400
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

2544
01:50:09.401 --> 01:50:10.181
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2545
01:50:10.181 --> 01:50:14.050
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wine had this chemical in it and he</v>

2546
01:50:14.051 --> 01:50:15.610
<v Speaker 3>named the chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what it was,</v>

2547
01:50:15.611 --> 01:50:18.120
<v Speaker 3>but it was the green bell pepper</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical and then he's.</v>

2548
01:50:18.250 --> 01:50:19.900
<v Speaker 3>And then when he gave me the green bell</v>
<v Speaker 3>pepper,</v>

2549
01:50:19.901 --> 01:50:24.160
<v Speaker 3>it overwhelmed my senses with that same</v>
<v Speaker 3>smell.</v>

2550
01:50:24.250 --> 01:50:26.370
<v Speaker 3>And so you know how if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2551
01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:29.420
<v Speaker 3>if you use windex in your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you smell it for a while and you're</v>

2552
01:50:29.421 --> 01:50:31.870
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmed by it and then in a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes you can't smell it anymore.</v>

2553
01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:35.020
<v Speaker 3>It's not that it's gone away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just that your brain has sort of</v>

2554
01:50:35.021 --> 01:50:36.100
<v Speaker 3>screened it out.</v>

2555
01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:39.380
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all factory senses dePend on change.</v>

2556
01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:40.633
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2557
01:50:40.810 --> 01:50:43.390
<v Speaker 3>And so once you get used to something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't smell it anymore.</v>

2558
01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:45.010
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it.</v>

2559
01:50:45.011 --> 01:50:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Same thinG happens with coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're drinking coffee and there's an</v>

2560
01:50:47.981 --> 01:50:51.520
<v Speaker 3>overwhelming element than your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your olfactory,</v>

2561
01:50:51.521 --> 01:50:54.010
<v Speaker 3>we'll screen it out and then you start</v>
<v Speaker 3>tasting different things.</v>

2562
01:50:55.330 --> 01:50:57.460
<v Speaker 3>So tHings change over time.</v>

2563
01:50:57.510 --> 01:51:01.130
<v Speaker 5>So smell certainly does enhance tastes</v>
<v Speaker 5>or change tastes.</v>

2564
01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:01.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In,</v>

2565
01:51:01.661 --> 01:51:03.680
<v Speaker 3>in coffee especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2566
01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:05.990
<v Speaker 3>it's at least half of thing.</v>

2567
01:51:06.210 --> 01:51:08.850
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't whine as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I find that like,</v>

2568
01:51:08.910 --> 01:51:11.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a good wine like are like red wine.</v>

2569
01:51:11.401 --> 01:51:14.640
<v Speaker 5>When I smell a good red wIne,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the smell of it actually makes it</v>

2570
01:51:14.641 --> 01:51:15.840
<v Speaker 5>seem somewhat more delicious.</v>

2571
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will flavor the definition of flavor is</v>

2572
01:51:18.861 --> 01:51:22.880
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the combination of aromatic and taste</v>

2573
01:51:23.210 --> 01:51:25.090
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you eliminate it,</v>

2574
01:51:25.091 --> 01:51:27.770
<v Speaker 3>if you have a cold or something and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminate your aromatics,</v>

2575
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:31.790
<v Speaker 3>suddenly food doesn't taste right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing is right because you're only</v>

2576
01:51:31.791 --> 01:51:32.870
<v Speaker 3>tasting sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sour,</v>

2577
01:51:32.871 --> 01:51:33.411
<v Speaker 3>salty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitter,</v>

2578
01:51:33.411 --> 01:51:35.750
<v Speaker 3>and savory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what you can experience on your</v>

2579
01:51:35.751 --> 01:51:40.040
<v Speaker 3>tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But your nose is able to get thousands</v>

2580
01:51:40.041 --> 01:51:40.970
<v Speaker 3>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's this,</v>

2581
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:43.040
<v Speaker 3>there's this phenomenon that happens</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're tasting things.</v>

2582
01:51:43.810 --> 01:51:45.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2583
01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:46.393
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2584
01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:51.640
<v Speaker 3>it's called retro nasal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you swallow this is weird,</v>

2585
01:51:51.861 --> 01:51:56.861
<v Speaker 3>but you swallow something and then it</v>
<v Speaker 3>coats your throat and that the aromatics</v>

2586
01:51:57.741 --> 01:52:01.580
<v Speaker 3>kind of go backwards up through your</v>
<v Speaker 3>nose from your throat.</v>

2587
01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:03.800
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2588
01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:07.160
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's called retro nasal from the back</v>

2589
01:52:07.161 --> 01:52:10.610
<v Speaker 3>of your notes and so you're actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>smelling things at the same time that</v>

2590
01:52:10.611 --> 01:52:11.690
<v Speaker 3>you're swallowing them.</v>

2591
01:52:11.710 --> 01:52:15.160
<v Speaker 5>That is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there any restaurant in the los</v>

2592
01:52:15.161 --> 01:52:17.680
<v Speaker 5>angeles area that gets the whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like great food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>great wine and great coffee.</v>

2594
01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:25.480
<v Speaker 5>That's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why doesn't someone nailed that?</v>

2595
01:52:25.481 --> 01:52:28.540
<v Speaker 5>Somebody should.</v>

2648
01:54:00.201 --> 01:54:02.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's the thing you see when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>work in coffee,</v>

2649
01:54:02.361 --> 01:54:05.780
<v Speaker 3>you go to cocktail parties or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People always ask you these questions.</v>

2650
01:54:05.781 --> 01:54:08.000
<v Speaker 3>They ask you what's your favorite coffee</v>
<v Speaker 3>and why?</v>

2651
01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:10.730
<v Speaker 3>Because they want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also want to know what the deal</v>

2652
01:54:10.731 --> 01:54:12.590
<v Speaker 3>with decaf is,</v>

2653
01:54:12.650 --> 01:54:13.483
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2654
01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:18.700
<v Speaker 3>so coffee has this alkaloid a caffeine</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

2655
01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:23.950
<v Speaker 3>and then you have to get it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first way that they got it out as</v>

2656
01:54:23.951 --> 01:54:25.820
<v Speaker 3>they use it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a solvent like,</v>

2657
01:54:25.821 --> 01:54:27.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like paint thinner.</v>

2658
01:54:27.340 --> 01:54:29.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of more like dry cleaning solvent.</v>

2659
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:31.850
<v Speaker 3>This is god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

2660
01:54:31.890 --> 01:54:36.230
<v Speaker 3>a 100 Years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they noticed that it was able to</v>

2661
01:54:36.231 --> 01:54:39.140
<v Speaker 3>take the caffeine out and that was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>original.</v>

2662
01:54:39.410 --> 01:54:41.350
<v Speaker 3>But nobody who wants to use that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2663
01:54:41.630 --> 01:54:46.630
<v Speaker 3>So over the years they've developed</v>
<v Speaker 3>better ways of doing it using carbon</v>

2664
01:54:46.821 --> 01:54:50.840
<v Speaker 3>dioxide or charcoal filters to get the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get the caffeine out.</v>

2665
01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:55.320
<v Speaker 5>And how much do you actually get out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I had heard that starbucks has a</v>

2666
01:54:55.321 --> 01:54:59.310
<v Speaker 5>particularly high caffeine content of</v>
<v Speaker 5>their regular coffee and that there</v>

2667
01:54:59.311 --> 01:55:02.910
<v Speaker 5>might be a little bit left to that when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have decaf sound right to me.</v>

2668
01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:03.793
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2669
01:55:04.830 --> 01:55:06.760
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see any reason why starbucks</v>

2670
01:55:06.761 --> 01:55:08.320
<v Speaker 3>would have a higher caffeine content</v>

2671
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:10.640
<v Speaker 5>of their coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's just an urban legend.</v>

2672
01:55:10.641 --> 01:55:11.990
<v Speaker 5>Sounds like engine to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2673
01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:13.960
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what about the decaf,</v>

2674
01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:16.910
<v Speaker 5>does it have any caffeine in it at all</v>
<v Speaker 5>or is it trace amounts?</v>

2675
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:18.200
<v Speaker 5>Trace trace</v>

2676
01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:19.410
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2677
01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:21.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2678
01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:23.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are like allergic sensitive</v>

2679
01:55:23.761 --> 01:55:25.740
<v Speaker 3>to it shouldn't drink decaffeinated</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>

2680
01:55:26.130 --> 01:55:29.150
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people that are uh,</v>

2681
01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:30.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2682
01:55:30.750 --> 01:55:33.690
<v Speaker 3>most and each of these methods is</v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly different,</v>

2683
01:55:34.350 --> 01:55:37.800
<v Speaker 3>but trace amounts of caffeine and</v>
<v Speaker 3>decaffeinated coffee,</v>

2684
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:39.690
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The good methods,</v>

2685
01:55:39.691 --> 01:55:41.430
<v Speaker 3>the swiss water process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2686
01:55:41.431 --> 01:55:43.400
<v Speaker 3>you may have heard of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2687
01:55:44.250 --> 01:55:45.090
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2688
01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:47.700
<v Speaker 3>is one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a number of these methods that</v>

2689
01:55:47.701 --> 01:55:50.310
<v Speaker 3>are really good at getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting the caffeine out and not</v>

2690
01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:51.600
<v Speaker 3>destroying the flavor of the coffee.</v>

2691
01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:55.230
<v Speaker 1>So what is the law says?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starbucks tall decaf.</v>

2692
01:55:55.231 --> 01:55:56.560
<v Speaker 1>A tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a small.</v>

2693
01:55:56.830 --> 01:55:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Has nine point five milligrams of</v>
<v Speaker 1>caffeine in it.</v>

2694
01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is a normal cup of coffee habit?</v>

2695
01:56:02.900 --> 01:56:05.390
<v Speaker 3>Like a hundred 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 years.</v>

2696
01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:08.150
<v Speaker 1>So that's the tray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a little bit,</v>

2697
01:56:08.151 --> 01:56:10.340
<v Speaker 1>a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not caffeine free.</v>

2698
01:56:10.341 --> 01:56:11.700
<v Speaker 1>It's just low caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2699
01:56:11.930 --> 01:56:13.250
<v Speaker 1>but that's pretty low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2700
01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:14.061
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2701
01:56:14.061 --> 01:56:17.420
<v Speaker 1>But unless you're super sensitive to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you have a 20 ounce decaf you're</v>

2702
01:56:17.421 --> 01:56:18.920
<v Speaker 1>getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about 18?</v>

2703
01:56:18.921 --> 01:56:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Maybe sort of double.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that.</v>

2704
01:56:20.841 --> 01:56:22.850
<v Speaker 1>A 16 ounce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixteen ounces double,</v>

2705
01:56:22.851 --> 01:56:24.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's an eight is a tall and</v>

2706
01:56:24.441 --> 01:56:24.890
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2707
01:56:24.890 --> 01:56:28.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the starbucks bar language that</v>

2708
01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:31.490
<v Speaker 1>don't write well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're get all goofy with grande's.</v>

2709
01:56:31.530 --> 01:56:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Call him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know venti is 20 ounces.</v>

2710
01:56:33.721 --> 01:56:34.431
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2711
01:56:34.431 --> 01:56:35.780
<v Speaker 1>That's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Called medium.</v>

2712
01:56:35.781 --> 01:56:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Just don't call it tall either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit ain't tall.</v>

2713
01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:41.180
<v Speaker 1>And what world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gulliver travels.</v>

2714
01:56:41.630 --> 01:56:43.700
<v Speaker 1>What world is that tall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

2715
01:56:43.890 --> 01:56:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if someone is a really sensitive to</v>

2716
01:56:47.661 --> 01:56:50.690
<v Speaker 1>caffeine though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can also still probably get a</v>

2717
01:56:50.691 --> 01:56:52.080
<v Speaker 1>little bit of a caffeine kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2718
01:56:52.081 --> 01:56:53.270
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a decaf,</v>

2719
01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:55.940
<v Speaker 1>they're super sensitive to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not caffeine free.</v>

2720
01:56:56.020 --> 01:56:57.770
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2721
01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I guess called decaf but it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>decaffeinated.</v>

2722
01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.680
<v Speaker 1>It's only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly.</v>

2723
01:57:02.710 --> 01:57:04.270
<v Speaker 1>It's mostly decaf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Decaffeinated.</v>

2724
01:57:04.271 --> 01:57:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2725
01:57:05.131 --> 01:57:06.250
<v Speaker 1>but the flavor,</v>

2726
01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:07.211
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2727
01:57:07.211 --> 01:57:09.970
<v Speaker 3>so now the flavors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2728
01:57:10.090 --> 01:57:10.930
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2729
01:57:11.050 --> 01:57:14.500
<v Speaker 3>I've done this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tasted great decaffeinate a great</v>

2730
01:57:14.501 --> 01:57:19.501
<v Speaker 3>coffee that becomes decaffeinated and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly the flavor is impacted by</v>

2731
01:57:20.411 --> 01:57:22.390
<v Speaker 3>caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the removal of caffeine,</v>

2732
01:57:22.391 --> 01:57:23.680
<v Speaker 3>by the process that goes through,</v>

2733
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:26.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's still delicious coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2734
01:57:26.121 --> 01:57:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Like give us an example of a delicious</v>
<v Speaker 1>decaffeinated coffee that we should.</v>

2735
01:57:30.090 --> 01:57:31.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of these,</v>

2736
01:57:31.170 --> 01:57:34.050
<v Speaker 3>any qa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any coffee company that's like putting</v>

2737
01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:36.360
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary care into their regular</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>

2738
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:39.780
<v Speaker 3>it's very likely that they will be</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting extraordinary care into their</v>

2739
01:57:39.781 --> 01:57:41.580
<v Speaker 3>decaf to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it Just,</v>

2740
01:57:41.610 --> 01:57:43.380
<v Speaker 3>you should ask them about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2741
01:57:43.530 --> 01:57:45.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2742
01:57:45.690 --> 01:57:46.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2743
01:57:46.891 --> 01:57:50.670
<v Speaker 3>if you engage with them and they weRe</v>
<v Speaker 3>proud of their decaf and his chances are</v>

2744
01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:53.490
<v Speaker 3>that they are putting a lot of care into</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2745
01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:54.870
<v Speaker 3>And I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2746
01:57:54.871 --> 01:57:58.650
<v Speaker 3>I used to run a coffee company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee program for a coffee company back</v>

2747
01:57:58.651 --> 01:58:03.651
<v Speaker 3>east called counterculture coffee and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>put extra effort into my decaffeinated</v>

2748
01:58:04.921 --> 01:58:08.220
<v Speaker 3>coffee because I knew that the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were drinking that we're drinking</v>

2749
01:58:08.221 --> 01:58:12.270
<v Speaker 3>it only for the flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't drinking it for the drug</v>

2750
01:58:12.271 --> 01:58:13.740
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2751
01:58:13.890 --> 01:58:16.050
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they cared enough about coffee that they</v>

2752
01:58:16.051 --> 01:58:18.780
<v Speaker 3>wanted to drink it just because of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way that it tasted.</v>

2753
01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:20.850
<v Speaker 3>And I felt like that was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility,</v>

2754
01:58:20.970 --> 01:58:21.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2755
01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:25.220
<v Speaker 1>that's a very interesting point because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not dealing with any people just</v>

2756
01:58:25.221 --> 01:58:25.990
<v Speaker 1>looking for a drug.</v>

2757
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:26.920
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2758
01:58:27.110 --> 01:58:29.320
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so and so,</v>

2759
01:58:29.410 --> 01:58:30.243
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

2760
01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:31.113
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem,</v>

2761
01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:36.120
<v Speaker 3>the problem with decaf I think is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>consumers who drink decaffeinated</v>

2762
01:58:37.451 --> 01:58:39.040
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't necessarily expect to pay</v>

2763
01:58:39.041 --> 01:58:41.020
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They feel lIke it should be the same,</v>

2764
01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:43.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I get that,</v>

2765
01:58:43.630 --> 01:58:47.290
<v Speaker 3>but it does cost money to put it through</v>
<v Speaker 3>the process of decaf</v>

2766
01:58:47.290 --> 01:58:49.720
<v Speaker 5>and eating well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't they feel like that most coffees</v>

2767
01:58:49.721 --> 01:58:52.150
<v Speaker 5>overpriced in the first place?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think people really truly</v>

2768
01:58:52.151 --> 01:58:56.470
<v Speaker 5>realize the amount of effort when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>broke it down by one pound is one tree</v>

2769
01:58:56.471 --> 01:58:58.330
<v Speaker 5>for a fucking year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's totally true.</v>

2770
01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:00.040
<v Speaker 5>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that an eight ounce bag of coffee?</v>

2771
01:59:00.041 --> 01:59:00.910
<v Speaker 5>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many?</v>

2772
01:59:00.911 --> 01:59:03.100
<v Speaker 5>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is bringing that real hawaiian</v>

2773
01:59:03.101 --> 01:59:05.800
<v Speaker 5>roasters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was that sales is probably 16 ounces.</v>

2774
01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:07.340
<v Speaker 5>Fourteen ounces,</v>
<v Speaker 5>14 ounces.</v>

2775
01:59:07.341 --> 01:59:09.920
<v Speaker 5>So it's essentially a year of one plant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2776
01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.650
<v Speaker 5>that's an unbelievable man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2777
01:59:11.790 --> 01:59:12.623
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy.</v>

2778
01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:16.240
<v Speaker 5>And you can get definitely 20 bucks or</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the hell it is.</v>

2779
01:59:16.241 --> 01:59:17.070
<v Speaker 5>So we have this idea</v>

2780
01:59:17.070 --> 01:59:21.000
<v Speaker 3>deal of the in the depression and nickel</v>
<v Speaker 3>cup of coffee and,</v>

2781
01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:22.620
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2782
01:59:22.621 --> 01:59:25.070
<v Speaker 3>that's what my grandparents had access</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a nickel cup of coffee</v>

2783
01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:30.690
<v Speaker 3>or a cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think it's stupid.</v>

2784
01:59:30.691 --> 01:59:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grow your own coffee dummy.</v>

2785
01:59:32.370 --> 01:59:34.320
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean that was intentional.</v>

2786
01:59:34.321 --> 01:59:36.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurants at that time,</v>

2787
01:59:36.570 --> 01:59:38.520
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were losing money on their five</v>

2788
01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:40.050
<v Speaker 3>cent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cup of coffee's even in the twenties</v>

2789
01:59:40.230 --> 01:59:42.090
<v Speaker 3>really because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they did that.</v>

2790
01:59:42.091 --> 01:59:44.010
<v Speaker 3>It was sort of a lost leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to get people into the</v>

2791
01:59:44.011 --> 01:59:44.844
<v Speaker 3>restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2792
01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:46.410
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2793
01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:50.250
<v Speaker 3>but it kind of stuck in people's mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>that coffee should be cheap and,</v>

2794
01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:51.630
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it shouldn't be.</v>

2795
01:59:51.631 --> 01:59:52.464
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2796
01:59:52.810 --> 01:59:57.060
<v Speaker 3>it in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee should be the best you can</v>

2797
01:59:57.061 --> 02:00:00.900
<v Speaker 3>possibly make it taste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if that costs money,</v>

2798
02:00:01.410 --> 02:00:02.510
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just drink.</v>

2799
02:00:02.540 --> 02:00:04.100
<v Speaker 5>Bless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let me ask you this.</v>

2800
02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:07.460
<v Speaker 5>Save your traveling across America and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you stop at a diner because you're</v>

2801
02:00:07.461 --> 02:00:10.070
<v Speaker 5>hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And do you even fuck around even order a</v>

2802
02:00:10.071 --> 02:00:11.780
<v Speaker 5>cup of coffee?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I do.</v>

2803
02:00:11.810 --> 02:00:14.120
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I get sad when they bring you</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

2804
02:00:14.121 --> 02:00:17.300
<v Speaker 5>That little stupid white cop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is tasted.</v>

2805
02:00:17.330 --> 02:00:18.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love diners.</v>

2806
02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:21.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love to eat at diners.</v>

2807
02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:22.820
<v Speaker 5>I freaking love,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't love that.</v>

2808
02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:23.780
<v Speaker 5>Drink coffee there.</v>

2809
02:00:24.030 --> 02:00:26.730
<v Speaker 3>And I love pancakes and hash browns and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>

2810
02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:31.890
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish that the few times I've gone to</v>

2811
02:00:31.891 --> 02:00:34.860
<v Speaker 3>places where the coffee was out</v>

2812
02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:36.373
<v Speaker 5>regionally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

2813
02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:37.580
<v Speaker 5>And did they tell you it was really</v>
<v Speaker 5>good?</v>

2814
02:00:37.581 --> 02:00:38.030
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2815
02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:40.130
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes sometimes they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're proud of their,</v>

2816
02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:44.720
<v Speaker 5>their deal and they all make it good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's someone who takes as much effort</v>

2817
02:00:44.721 --> 02:00:47.140
<v Speaker 5>into their omelets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right as they do into their craft.</v>

2818
02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:48.711
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it should be,</v>

2819
02:00:48.711 --> 02:00:50.870
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it should be expected if it's</v>

2820
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:53.260
<v Speaker 5>financially feasible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's.</v>

2821
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:56.330
<v Speaker 5>And That's what it comes down to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People got to be willing to pay for good</v>

2822
02:00:56.331 --> 02:00:58.070
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what does the bag like this</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2859
02:02:20.901 --> 02:02:23.780
<v Speaker 5>And then eats the beans and then ships</v>
<v Speaker 5>them out and then they take it out of</v>

2860
02:02:23.781 --> 02:02:27.020
<v Speaker 5>its poop and when it goes through its</v>
<v Speaker 5>digestive tract,</v>

2861
02:02:27.050 --> 02:02:29.810
<v Speaker 5>it imparts a very mellow taste to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>coffee.</v>

2862
02:02:30.070 --> 02:02:32.360
<v Speaker 5>So it got in this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the bucket list,</v>

2863
02:02:32.361 --> 02:02:33.310
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>

2864
02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:35.330
<v Speaker 5>The bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a movie called the bucket list.</v>

2865
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:38.600
<v Speaker 5>Jack nicholson.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you don't remember this,</v>

2866
02:02:38.601 --> 02:02:38.900
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2867
02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:40.910
<v Speaker 5>I never heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about some old guys and they had a</v>

2868
02:02:40.911 --> 02:02:43.160
<v Speaker 5>bucket list of things to have things to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do before they died.</v>

2869
02:02:43.161 --> 02:02:47.750
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things was they drink the</v>
<v Speaker 5>coffee and so that of course it started</v>

2870
02:02:47.751 --> 02:02:51.260
<v Speaker 5>a rash of people asking people like me</v>
<v Speaker 5>about this,</v>

2871
02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:52.850
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

2872
02:02:52.850 --> 02:02:54.560
<v Speaker 5>Here's the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that cute little thing.</v>

2873
02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:56.211
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's fake,</v>

2874
02:02:56.211 --> 02:02:57.740
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not really talking.</v>

2875
02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:00.170
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the beans that he pooped out.</v>

2876
02:03:00.410 --> 02:03:04.550
<v Speaker 5>I first tried that with my friend tate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's one of the owners of caveman</v>

2877
02:03:04.551 --> 02:03:05.870
<v Speaker 5>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tate's always been a,</v>

2878
02:03:05.871 --> 02:03:07.820
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a crazy coffee kind of sore.</v>

2879
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:11.150
<v Speaker 5>But we were in miami and we saw this</v>
<v Speaker 5>caveman coffee by the way.</v>

2880
02:03:11.390 --> 02:03:12.650
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's out of New Mexico.</v>

2881
02:03:12.651 --> 02:03:13.250
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>

2882
02:03:13.250 --> 02:03:17.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm in this place in miami was some sort</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a specialty coffee joint.</v>

2883
02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:22.130
<v Speaker 5>There was a restaurant that had these</v>
<v Speaker 5>really expensive coffees and I forget</v>

2884
02:03:22.131 --> 02:03:25.090
<v Speaker 5>what it was like 30 bucks a glass a cup</v>
<v Speaker 5>or somethIng really expensive.</v>

2885
02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:27.470
<v Speaker 5>Something really nutty because it came</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of this cats.</v>

2886
02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:32.300
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the problem is that it's really rare</v>

2887
02:03:32.301 --> 02:03:35.060
<v Speaker 5>and that's why it's expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's good though.</v>

2888

2901
02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:03.320
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because people got a chance to see what</v>

2902
02:04:03.321 --> 02:04:04.154
<v Speaker 5>it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Their slave colonies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're enslaving intelligent beings</v>

2905
02:04:10.641 --> 02:04:11.810
<v Speaker 5>that we can understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>

2906
02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:13.340
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is 100 percent and,</v>

2907
02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:14.600
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2908
02:04:14.630 --> 02:04:17.600
<v Speaker 5>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a touch of that same sadness when</v>

2909
02:04:17.601 --> 02:04:20.900
<v Speaker 5>I saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I saw that and I've been to the</v>

2910
02:04:20.930 --> 02:04:25.430
<v Speaker 5>places where they do this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imagining it just stands to reason.</v>

2911
02:04:25.431 --> 02:04:27.960
<v Speaker 5>if you have a product like this that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>very expensive,</v>

2912
02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:29.580
<v Speaker 5>then you're going to have these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>animals.</v>

2913
02:04:29.581 --> 02:04:32.420
<v Speaker 5>do you get a lot of fraud because it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>so expensive,</v>

2914
02:04:32.590 --> 02:04:34.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine so.</v>

2915
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.850
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2916
02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:35.630
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2917
02:04:35.630 --> 02:04:38.340
<v Speaker 5>I mean the amount of pleasure that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can get from a coffee,</v>

2918
02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:41.850
<v Speaker 3>like the one I brought you or some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these other ones that you've mentioned.</v>

2919
02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:43.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2920
02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:48.540
<v Speaker 3>it's not solely necessarily to go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that extent.</v>

2921
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:50.370
<v Speaker 3>The other thing I noticed on the twitter</v>
<v Speaker 3>feed,</v>

2922
02:04:50.371 --> 02:04:52.560
<v Speaker 3>somebody mentioned coffee going extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a news,</v>

2923
02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:54.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a year ago,</v>

2924
02:04:54.031 --> 02:04:57.360
<v Speaker 3>there was a news thIng that was talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about coffee going extinct.</v>

2925
02:04:57.800 --> 02:04:59.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2926
02:04:59.310 --> 02:05:02.430
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's because,</v>

2927
02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:05.850
<v Speaker 3>so that this is tied into this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2928
02:05:06.810 --> 02:05:08.940
<v Speaker 3>this Ethiopia thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2929
02:05:08.941 --> 02:05:09.840
<v Speaker 3>the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2930
02:05:09.841 --> 02:05:12.660
<v Speaker 3>98,</v>
<v Speaker 3>99 percent of the total genetic</v>

2931
02:05:12.661 --> 02:05:16.710
<v Speaker 3>diversity of coffee is in Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not only in in the country,</v>

2932
02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:19.560
<v Speaker 3>but in one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go,</v>

2933
02:05:19.561 --> 02:05:22.140
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fast on the um,</v>

2934
02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:24.660
<v Speaker 3>it's not even Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

2935
02:05:24.661 --> 02:05:28.890
<v Speaker 3>it's the south west part of Ethiopia</v>
<v Speaker 3>where coffee is indigenous to</v>

2936
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:30.860
<v Speaker 1>pull an image of the beans itself like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2937
02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:33.440
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you gotta get a blow up on one of</v>

2938
02:05:33.441 --> 02:05:35.630
<v Speaker 1>those because most people don't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what coffee beans look like.</v>

2939
02:05:36.010 --> 02:05:38.300
<v Speaker 1>So those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call them coffee cherries for obvious</v>

2940
02:05:38.301 --> 02:05:39.081
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2941
02:05:39.081 --> 02:05:42.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean they look like a fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting because we think of</v>

2942
02:05:42.141 --> 02:05:43.430
<v Speaker 1>coffee as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2943
02:05:43.431 --> 02:05:45.350
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're crazy,</v>

2944
02:05:45.351 --> 02:05:46.900
<v Speaker 1>you grind your own stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2945
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:50.360
<v Speaker 1>That's how most people think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's already cooked and roasted and</v>

2946
02:05:50.420 --> 02:05:51.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think of it as food</v>

2947
02:05:52.340 --> 02:05:53.300
<v Speaker 3>in coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2948
02:05:53.301 --> 02:05:56.190
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2949
02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:59.700
<v Speaker 3>one of the biggest things that we can do</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people that is,</v>

2950
02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:01.970
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's beautiful grapes.</v>

2951
02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:04.760

<v Speaker 3>the seed of a fruit.</v>

2952
02:06:04.930 --> 02:06:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I need to get some of that coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fruit I want to eat,</v>

2953
02:06:08.530 --> 02:06:12.640

<v Speaker 1>Where can I go and actually buy the</v>

2954

<v Speaker 1>fruit and eat it?</v>

2982
02:07:07.061 --> 02:07:10.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been on a journey to kind of understand</v>

2983
02:07:10.841 --> 02:07:13.420
<v Speaker 1>and learn the process of this over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last few months,</v>

2984
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:18.750
<v Speaker 1>just really kind of digging deep into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coffee flavor a barrel.</v>

02:07:20.951 --> 02:07:25.870
<v Speaker 1>very intriguing and stimulating in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of ways.</v>

2987
02:07:25.871 --> 02:07:29.260
<v Speaker 1>just the ideas behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's cool to uncover this whole</v>

2988
02:07:29.261 --> 02:07:34.261
<v Speaker 1>sort of community of people trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhance flavors and tight taste them and</v>

2989
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:36.821
<v Speaker 5>change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2990
02:07:36.821 --> 02:07:41.020
<v Speaker 5>I had no idea there was a specialty</v>
<v Speaker 5>coffee association of America until just</v>

2991
02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:41.560
<v Speaker 5>a few days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2992
02:07:41.560 --> 02:07:43.450
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean serious business and you want to</v>

2993
02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:44.560
<v Speaker 5>see a.org.</v>

2994
02:07:44.670 --> 02:07:47.340
<v Speaker 3>You want to hear a crazy thing you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about like intellectual</v>

2995
02:07:47.341 --> 02:07:49.720
<v Speaker 3>connection and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2996
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:53.790
<v Speaker 3>so coffee was invented in Ethiopia as we</v>
<v Speaker 3>said in,</v>

2997
02:07:53.820 --> 02:07:56.400
<v Speaker 3>in Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do it like a coffee ceremony,</v>

2998
02:07:56.490 --> 02:07:57.360
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2999
02:07:57.370 --> 02:07:59.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a very ceremonial way to prepare it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and drink it.</v>

3000
02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:03.240
<v Speaker 3>And when they do the coffee ceremony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3001
02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:06.300
<v Speaker 3>It's like they gather people together</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the village,</v>

3002
02:08:06.301 --> 02:08:09.300
<v Speaker 3>they and they talk about things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They talk about the news of the village,</v>

3003
02:08:09.301 --> 02:08:13.050
<v Speaker 3>they talk about things that are going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>

3004
02:08:13.530 --> 02:08:16.380
<v Speaker 3>When coffee moved from Ethiopia to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yemen,</v>

3005
02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:18.930
<v Speaker 3>totally different deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in Ethiopia,</v>

3006
02:08:18.931 --> 02:08:22.620
<v Speaker 3>it's always a woman that makes coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas in Yemen it wasn't like that,</v>

3007
02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:26.790
<v Speaker 3>but they still would talk about news and</v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual and stuff like that.</v>

3008
02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:30.380
<v Speaker 3>Then coffee moved from Yemen to europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3009
02:08:31.170 --> 02:08:34.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Italy and england and places like that</v>

3010
02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:39.740
<v Speaker 3>and the coffee house still remained a</v>
<v Speaker 3>place for intellectual exchange and</v>

3011
02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:44.460
<v Speaker 3>discourse and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They planned the american revolution in</v>

3012
02:08:44.461 --> 02:08:46.080
<v Speaker 3>coffee houses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3013
02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:47.073
<v Speaker 3>in</v>

3014
02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:48.153
<v Speaker 5>we're wired,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3015
02:08:48.210 --> 02:08:48.841
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

3016
02:08:48.841 --> 02:08:51.410
<v Speaker 5>there's something about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something about coffee that like</v>

3017
02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:54.030
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like gets your mind going as well as</v>

3018
02:08:54.450 --> 02:08:57.990
<v Speaker 5>stimulates you and wakes you up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But also the tea party movement like</v>

3019
02:08:58.010 --> 02:09:00.930
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that had an effect on the way the United</v>

3020
02:09:00.930 --> 02:09:04.950
<v Speaker 5>States took off just by simply the fact</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they went from tea to coffee.</v>

3021
02:09:04.951 --> 02:09:05.650
<v Speaker 5>That's what the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3022
02:09:05.650 --> 02:09:07.530
<v Speaker 5>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are people who speculate that</v>

3023
02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:09.470
<v Speaker 5>that's totally valid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3024
02:09:09.610 --> 02:09:09.980
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3025
02:09:09.980 --> 02:09:14.300
<v Speaker 3>that coffee consumption is a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>american,</v>

3026
02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:17.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive to ingenuity and imagination.</v>

3027
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:19.730
<v Speaker 5>Ron's fucking speed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're country on speed.</v>

3028
02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:23.060
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if they could show gross</v>
<v Speaker 5>domestic product posts.</v>

3029
02:09:23.061 --> 02:09:27.050
<v Speaker 5>Starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not starbucks impacted people's</v>

3030
02:09:27.140 --> 02:09:28.610
<v Speaker 5>productivity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but still right.</v>

3031
02:09:28.611 --> 02:09:29.110
<v Speaker 5>If you go to</v>

3032
02:09:29.110 --> 02:09:31.990
<v Speaker 3>somebody at a coffee shop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to talk about something</v>

3033
02:09:31.991 --> 02:09:36.070
<v Speaker 3>that's different than going to drink</v>
<v Speaker 3>with somebody at a bar or have dinner</v>

3034
02:09:36.071 --> 02:09:38.320
<v Speaker 3>with somebody or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different.</v>

3035
02:09:38.321 --> 02:09:39.950
<v Speaker 3>It's somehow more about exchanging info</v>

3036
02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:41.970
<v Speaker 5>nation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more imagination.</v>

3037
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.710
<v Speaker 5>It's stimulating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The stimulant of caffeine in coffee is</v>

3038
02:09:46.711 --> 02:09:49.260
<v Speaker 5>stimulating and then the flavor is</v>
<v Speaker 5>enriching.</v>

3039
02:09:49.261 --> 02:09:52.770
<v Speaker 5>You enjoy the flavor and then you get</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking happy and it's been that way</v>

3040
02:09:52.771 --> 02:09:56.370
<v Speaker 5>since the origin of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Coffee houses.</v>

3041
02:09:56.610 --> 02:09:58.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Coffeehouses were always thought of as</v>

3042
02:09:58.171 --> 02:10:00.350
<v Speaker 5>places where people read poetry and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>

3043
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:02.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he politics,</v>

3044
02:10:02.620 --> 02:10:05.100
<v Speaker 5>etc. And as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>plan revolutions.</v>

3045
02:10:05.101 --> 02:10:06.510
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3046
02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:08.840
<v Speaker 5>it is interesting and that's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>reasons</v>

3047
02:10:08.890 --> 02:10:12.640
<v Speaker 3>that I think that I like to work in</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee because I'm into that sort of</v>

3048
02:10:12.641 --> 02:10:13.240
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

3049
02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:16.240
<v Speaker 3>Intellectual engagement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>creativity,</v>

3050
02:10:16.570 --> 02:10:17.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>

3051
02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:19.300
<v Speaker 3>poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

3052
02:10:19.570 --> 02:10:20.530
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3053
02:10:20.550 --> 02:10:22.810
<v Speaker 3>this is always been like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this.</v>

3054
02:10:22.811 --> 02:10:25.390
<v Speaker 3>And in asia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in arabia,</v>

3055
02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:26.940
<v Speaker 3>everywhere the coffee goes to second.</v>

3056
02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:32.120
<v Speaker 5>Do you feel like coffee doesn't get</v>
<v Speaker 5>enough credit for the impact that it has</v>

3057
02:10:32.671 --> 02:10:33.870
<v Speaker 5>had culturally?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3058
02:10:33.871 --> 02:10:34.280
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

3059
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:37.650
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think sometimes it bums me out this</v>

3060
02:10:37.710 --> 02:10:42.300
<v Speaker 3>idea of like cheap people want cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>abundant coffee,</v>

3061
02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:46.200
<v Speaker 3>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only function is as a drug to get</v>

3062
02:10:46.201 --> 02:10:47.910
<v Speaker 3>them to work in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3063
02:10:47.911 --> 02:10:50.390
<v Speaker 3>and it's been cheapened by our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3064
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:54.460
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but It's it special and,</v>

3065
02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:56.970
<v Speaker 3>and it could go away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3066
02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:58.290
<v Speaker 3>really well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3067
02:10:58.291 --> 02:11:00.930
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole extinction thing is about,</v>

3068
02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:04.790
<v Speaker 3>about how we're 98 percent of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3069
02:11:05.580 --> 02:11:08.220
<v Speaker 3>the origin of coffee is because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>climate change.</v>

3070
02:11:08.790 --> 02:11:13.710
<v Speaker 3>The scientist who does this work is done</v>
<v Speaker 3>the projections and if and if the</v>

3071
02:11:13.740 --> 02:11:17.790
<v Speaker 3>weather there as predicted increases by</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few degrees,</v>

3072
02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:23.550
<v Speaker 3>then the coffee won't be able to survive</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it could be 80 percent wiped out in</v>

3073
02:11:23.551 --> 02:11:25.890
<v Speaker 3>these natural coffee forests in 50</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

3074
02:11:26.070 --> 02:11:26.903
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3075
02:11:27.410 --> 02:11:32.270
<v Speaker 3>And then then we'll be up a creek</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the motherload of genetic origin</v>

3076
02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:37.040
<v Speaker 3>of coffee will be gone essentially.</v>

3077
02:11:37.770 --> 02:11:40.260
<v Speaker 1>That's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then can there be steps done too,</v>

3078
02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:42.440
<v Speaker 3>guard that we're trying to do that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the industry.</v>

3079
02:11:42.441 --> 02:11:46.190
<v Speaker 3>So we had actually at a conference about</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year ago on this very question where</v>

3080
02:11:46.191 --> 02:11:49.670
<v Speaker 3>we talked about preservation of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic diversity of coffee,</v>

3081
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:52.040
<v Speaker 3>which means taking coffee out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ethiopia,</v>

3082
02:11:52.041 --> 02:11:55.640
<v Speaker 3>planting it elsewhere to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got other examples of the same,</v>

3083
02:11:55.970 --> 02:11:58.730
<v Speaker 3>of the genetic diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity in other parts of the world.</v>

3084
02:11:59.330 --> 02:12:00.163
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3085
02:12:00.260 --> 02:12:04.190
<v Speaker 3>preserving it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's other ways to preserve a coffee,</v>

3086
02:12:04.250 --> 02:12:06.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by freezing the seeds,</v>

3087
02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:08.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and putting them in storage.</v>

3088
02:12:08.001 --> 02:12:09.500
<v Speaker 3>So if we need them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can go back to them.</v>

3089
02:12:10.210 --> 02:12:12.190
<v Speaker 1>This has been an eyeopening podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
