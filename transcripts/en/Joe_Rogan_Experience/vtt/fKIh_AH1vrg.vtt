<v Speaker 1>We're also brought to you by [inaudible].</v>

62
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm ting is a mobile cell phone company that uses a sprint backbone.</v>

63
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

64
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they did this.</v>

65
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was like other people have had this idea.</v>

66
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Are there people who have done things like this before,</v>

67
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>but what they decided to do was,</v>

68
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>I guess they rent,</v>

69
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>they rent time on the sprint backbone and they sell it back to you.</v>

70
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.320
<v Speaker 1>And the way they do it is they have their company setup in a way that it makes</v>

71
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

72
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were gonna like,</v>

73
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.040
<v Speaker 1>I wish my company did this,</v>

74
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I wish my company had no contracts.</v>

75
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I wish my company would refund money if I didn't use,</v>

76
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.580
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

78
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.830
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

79
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.011
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

80
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>the minutes credit on unused service if you use less than you thought you would,</v>

81
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>tear drops you down and credits you the difference on your next bill.</v>

82
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>So I've never heard of a company doing that.</v>

83
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

84
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>I love hearing that Shit.</v>

85
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Unlimited devices on one plan.</v>

86
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.660
<v Speaker 1>You can have as many devices on you want on one plan and you can share pooled</v>

87
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>minutes messages and megabytes.</v>

88
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>And each device has a plan on a plant,</v>

89
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>costs a flat fee of $6 per month.</v>

90
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's beautiful company.</v>

91
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

92
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>they also have the best android phones.</v>

93
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>You can buy really cool ones like the Samsung Galaxy note too,</v>

94
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.840
<v Speaker 1>which is that giant fucking delicious one kid's screen envy every time I see it.</v>

95
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>So pretty bad ass looking foam.</v>

96
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>They have the galaxy s three.</v>

97
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I think they're getting the s four.</v>

98
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>That's how is that out yet?</v>

99
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 1>The s four?</v>

100
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.733
<v Speaker 1>Not quite out yet.</v>

101
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.911
<v Speaker 1>It's not out.</v>

102
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:37.744
<v Speaker 1>It's on the way out.</v>

103
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>They keep pumping these out,</v>

104
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:39.551
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

105
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:39.701
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

106
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting because they really have lit a fire under apple's ass</v>

107
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>because for the longest time there was no benefit to having any device other</v>

108
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 1>than an iphone.</v>

109
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.690
<v Speaker 1>I had that touch screen blackberry because I was trying to stick with verizon.</v>

110
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.531
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

111
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>What a piece of shit.</v>

112
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>

113
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>What a wretched clunky clicky piece of shit.</v>

114
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.260
<v Speaker 1>You're in Austin now.</v>

115
00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:02.870
<v Speaker 1>You weren't in denial because you still might hate it.</v>

116
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 1>I just liked verizon.</v>

117
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 1>I used,</v>

118
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 1>back then I used phones more.</v>

119
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I used my phone to make calls.</v>

120
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I was very,</v>

121
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>very little texting and never online,</v>

122
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>so for me it was just important that I could use it to,</v>

123
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:16.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>to call people.</v>

125
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>But then it was just too,</v>

126
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.690
<v Speaker 1>it was too hard.</v>

127
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.170
<v Speaker 1>He would try to get your email or something.</v>

128
00:04:22.171 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>It was a fucking joke to try to write an email and that click,</v>

129
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.001
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

130
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

131
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.661
<v Speaker 1>click.</v>

132
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Every time you touch it,</v>

133
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.050
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

134
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.351
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

135
00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

136
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.473
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

137
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.801
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

138
00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:29.634
<v Speaker 1>click.</v>

139
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.310

141
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.350

<v Speaker 1>But that's not the case anymore.</v>

00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:43.280
<v Speaker 1>the one that I have,</v>

148
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>

149
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.320
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at a website and it's such a different experience and looking on</v>

150
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>a website on my phone and the note takes it to the next level of known as like</v>

151
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:52.121
<v Speaker 1>five inches.</v>

152
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:54.310
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking gigantic like me</v>

153
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.520
<v Speaker 1>snipped in on your lads.</v>

154
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 1>If you go to Rogan.ting.com,</v>

155
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:05.660
<v Speaker 1>you save yourself 25 bucks on either a device or um,</v>

156
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.791

157
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 1>or credit for service as well.</v>

158
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 1>So the 25 bucks is applicable to either one.</v>

159
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:12.910
<v Speaker 1>It's [inaudible] dot ting.com.</v>

160
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.700
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

164
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.671
<v Speaker 1>it all works,</v>

165
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:19.181
<v Speaker 1>bitches.</v>

166
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful and delicious.</v>

167
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 1>So go team for business.</v>

168
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:23.404
<v Speaker 1>I'm going with that is</v>

169
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>probably something good.</v>

170
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 1>They probably have better,</v>

171
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>bigger plans or something.</v>

172
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

173
00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:32.440
<v Speaker 1>We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com.</v>

174
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>That's o n n I t if you haven't seen the chimp kettlebells are out there,</v>

175
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

176
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 1>the first of this new thing that we're doing called primal bells.</v>

177
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>And what we've done is a hire artists to,</v>

178
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

179
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.210
<v Speaker 1>create,</v>

180
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

181
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.343
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

182
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.650
<v Speaker 1>these images to create sculptures of angry chimpanzees.</v>

183
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>One of them we've got,</v>

184
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give away,</v>

185
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I already gave away the gorilla,</v>

186
00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:56.210
<v Speaker 1>the gorilla.</v>

187
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.741
<v Speaker 1>So dope.</v>

188
00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't keep it together.</v>

189
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.540
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>

190
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of really cool ones we have coming out and it's all,</v>

191
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 1>they're all designed by someone who does special effects models.</v>

192
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.293
<v Speaker 1>They do like,</v>

193
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 1>monsters,</v>

195
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 1>monster movie type Shit.</v>

196
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 1>So we hired him to make a Kettlebell.</v>

197
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 1>We also three d scanned it to make sure that it's totally,</v>

198
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 1>completely balanced.</v>

199
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.370
<v Speaker 1>The problem with these sort of joke workout pieces of equipment is,</v>

200
00:06:20.371 --> 00:06:21.710
<v Speaker 1>and then they look great,</v>

201
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 1>but they're not as effective as the real thing.</v>

202
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 1>These are as effective as any kettlebell you get.</v>

203
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.490
<v Speaker 1>You have to watch which way your hand it.</v>

204
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.553
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

205
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.620
<v Speaker 1>handle it so that the chimp face as a slam in your arm.</v>

206
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.581
<v Speaker 1>But even if it did,</v>

207
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:35.414
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

208
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

209
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I've used them both ways.</v>

210
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big of a deal,</v>

211
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.520
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a manly man like myself,</v>

212
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 1>but the point is that it's their excellently bounced.</v>

213
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 1>We had unbalanced absolutely perfectly with really thick handles too.</v>

214
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's really difficult to use,</v>

215
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:50.571
<v Speaker 1>which is what you want.</v>

216
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 1>You want something to really work your grip in.</v>

217
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>If you've never had any kettlebell exercise in your life before,</v>

218
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I urge you to find a trainer and have someone show you in person.</v>

219
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 1>If you can afford that,</v>

220
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.163
<v Speaker 1>if you can't,</v>

221
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of online videos.</v>

222
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.540
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

223
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

224
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.480
<v Speaker 1>if you go to like youtube,</v>

225
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.021
<v Speaker 1>there's many,</v>

226
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:09.201
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

227
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:09.411
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

228
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:11.390
<v Speaker 1>many online instructional that you can get for free.</v>

229
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.630
<v Speaker 1>But you want to really be diligent about your form.</v>

230
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 1>You really want to be diligent about your actual fitness level.</v>

231
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Don't push yourself too quick and hurt yourself and you don't lift too much</v>

232
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:22.754
<v Speaker 1>weight too easily,</v>

233
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.480
<v Speaker 1>just in the beginnings or too quickly rather than beginning.</v>

234
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Try Light,</v>

235
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 1>lighter weights.</v>

236
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:28.723
<v Speaker 1>Try just,</v>

237
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

238
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 1>you're just trying to build slowly every day.</v>

239
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Just write it down.</v>

240
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Make yourself do it.</v>

241
00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:36.050
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to get in shape and if you really want to work hard,</v>

242
00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:37.460
<v Speaker 1>don't go all at once.</v>

243
00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:39.080
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy because when you go all at once,</v>

244
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:40.100
<v Speaker 1>you break things.</v>

245
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:41.810
<v Speaker 1>You fuck up your muscles,</v>

246
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 1>you pull things,</v>

247
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:43.191
<v Speaker 1>your hurt,</v>

248
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:44.024
<v Speaker 1>your knees.</v>

249
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.871
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that.</v>

250
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 1>You gotta you gotta train if you're going to train hard and you should have been</v>

251
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:49.190
<v Speaker 1>training hard for years already,</v>

252
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.450
<v Speaker 1>and so the.</v>

253
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:55.451
<v Speaker 1>The idea behind a functional fitness like kettlebells or steel maces or steel</v>

254
00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:56.151
<v Speaker 1>clubs,</v>

255
00:07:56.151 --> 00:07:56.651
<v Speaker 1>these clubs,</v>

256
00:07:56.651 --> 00:07:57.200
<v Speaker 1>bells,</v>

257
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.200
<v Speaker 1>all these different things that we sell is the idea of using things using</v>

258
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 1>workout equipment that provides you with functional real world strength.</v>

259
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:11.400
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in the mountains and a mountain lion jumps and you managed to get a</v>

260
00:08:11.401 --> 00:08:12.530
<v Speaker 1>hold of his neck,</v>

261
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 1>how confident are you in your endurance?</v>

262
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.280
<v Speaker 1>How long can you fight this motherfucker off?</v>

263
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Is it a difference between life or death?</v>

264
00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:22.910
<v Speaker 1>In some situations,</v>

265
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.940
<v Speaker 1>most likely the mountain lions can fuck you up unless you have some sort of a</v>

266
00:08:25.941 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 1>knife or he's a pussy.</v>

267
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Could get lucky and find some pussy ass mountain lion that maybe got fucked up</v>

268
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:36.020
<v Speaker 1>by a bear a couple of weeks ago and it still doesn't have a stage legs back</v>

269
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>under them.</v>

270
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.513
<v Speaker 1>PTSD,</v>

271
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.433
<v Speaker 1>PTSD.</v>

272
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Some woman got attacked by a wolf recently in Alberta.</v>

273
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy shit.</v>

274
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 1>She had these bite marks on her neck,</v>

275
00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:48.860
<v Speaker 1>but there was a bunch of people around.</v>

276
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:50.780
<v Speaker 1>So apparently the wolf flutter go big.</v>

277
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred pound Timberwolf just took this lady down and bit her neck and a</v>

278
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.540
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people around there and people were freaking out because there were so</v>

279
00:08:57.541 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 1>many people and people were freaking out.</v>

280
00:08:58.741 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 1>The wolf just bailed,</v>

281
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 1>but he got so bold and so scary that he jumped on this chick and the chick just</v>

282
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 1>got in her car and drove to the hospital.</v>

283
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy story,</v>

284
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:09.820
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

285
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Wolf let go of her neck.</v>

286
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:12.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

287
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.060

288
00:09:13.061 --> 00:09:14.130
<v Speaker 1>like there's images of it.</v>

289
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 1>You could find it online.</v>

290
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 1>There's images of her neck.</v>

291
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:18.180
<v Speaker 1>She got off relatively lucky.</v>

292
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.310
<v Speaker 1>She's lucky it was on wolf a pack.</v>

293
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

294
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 1>I think if it was a lone wolf,</v>

295
00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 1>it's also positive possible.</v>

296
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:27.890
<v Speaker 1>That's why it was so fucking hungry that got kicked out of the pack.</v>

297
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Like if it's a big old male,</v>

298
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:30.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

299
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.050
<v Speaker 1>it might be that it's on its way out and some new mail took over and now he's</v>

300
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:34.471
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>

301
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:35.430
<v Speaker 1>He's out there by himself.</v>

302
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.690
<v Speaker 1>That's how they die.</v>

303
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:37.921
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>

304
00:09:37.921 --> 00:09:38.670
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

305
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 1>that's an exile on the wolf world.</v>

306
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking terrible,</v>

307
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:43.434
<v Speaker 1>terrible thing.</v>

308
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

309
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

310
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.270
<v Speaker 1>they're essentially saying,</v>

311
00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:46.410
<v Speaker 1>we've got no room for any anymore,</v>

312
00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:46.711
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

313
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 1>You gotta you gotTa fucking kick the bricks.</v>

314
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.170
<v Speaker 1>As poor wolf's got to go out and try to get some elk himself.</v>

315
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.630
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for one both to kill an elk.</v>

316
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.410
<v Speaker 1>You got to get a gang of them and you've got no fucking box them in and take</v>

317
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:01.040
<v Speaker 1>them out by the legs and look for the little ones and you know,</v>

318
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 1>but those wolves on their own man,</v>

319
00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:03.991
<v Speaker 1>this bit,</v>

320
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:04.824
<v Speaker 1>this chick's neck.</v>

321
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe if the bitch Nigga little Jujitsu and had some kettlebell training,</v>

322
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.080
<v Speaker 1>she could fight off that Pussy Wolf that will obviously it was a pussy.</v>

323
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

324
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.710
<v Speaker 1>if they're like bites in the neck and then he's like,</v>

325
00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:17.400
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

326
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.450
<v Speaker 1>He got that close.</v>

327
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.351
<v Speaker 1>He got that close.</v>

328
00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:20.250
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to try to eat her.</v>

329
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.033
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

330
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 1>are we talking to dating now?</v>

331
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Are still with the wolves?</v>

332
00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay Dude,</v>

333
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:28.530
<v Speaker 1>you can't say them on the podcast podcast.</v>

334
00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:29.790
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about defending yourself.</v>

335
00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:30.624
<v Speaker 1>Get Wolves</v>

336
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.030
<v Speaker 1>now by a wolf.</v>

337
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.560
<v Speaker 1>What if they were the best at it?</v>

338
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.840
<v Speaker 1>What if I get super dangerous?</v>

339
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

340
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.760
<v Speaker 1>every now and then someone got their pussy bit,</v>

341
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.020
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part,</v>

342
00:10:40.021 --> 00:10:41.610
<v Speaker 1>like orgasms by Wolf,</v>

343
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.361
<v Speaker 1>eating your pussy.</v>

344
00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:43.470
<v Speaker 1>He's like the greatest thing ever.</v>

345
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:44.990
<v Speaker 1>It's put their snout in there.</v>

346
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a really muscular tongues and that they're not scared to get dirty.</v>

347
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.673
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

348
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is appropriate,</v>

349
00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:56.511
<v Speaker 1>but when I heard a lot of stories about women who are menstruating camping and</v>

350
00:10:57.601 --> 00:11:02.340
<v Speaker 1>the blood attracted grizzly bears and you gotta be really careful camping with a</v>

351
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:03.210
<v Speaker 1>woman who's been destroyed.</v>

352
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.810
<v Speaker 1>God and what are the bare decides that you're a pussy for?</v>

353
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:11.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do and they find the one with that missing.</v>

354
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

355
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:15.270
<v Speaker 1>that's so scary.</v>

356
00:11:15.271 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good image.</v>

357
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.730
<v Speaker 1>That's such a scary animal.</v>

358
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.470
<v Speaker 1>The scariest thing about them,</v>

359
00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:21.090
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about this in the podcast before,</v>

360
00:11:21.091 --> 00:11:22.500
<v Speaker 1>but is that they don't kill you.</v>

361
00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:23.334
<v Speaker 1>They just started eating.</v>

362
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Some animals will kill you first.</v>

363
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:26.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

364
00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:27.030
<v Speaker 1>that's a black bear.</v>

365
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

366
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Even Grizzlies,</v>

367
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.970
<v Speaker 1>they don't kill you.</v>

368
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:31.230
<v Speaker 1>They will kill you eventually,</v>

369
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Speaker 1>but they start eating you.</v>

370
00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:32.880
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

371
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.240
<v Speaker 1>They don't have that instinct like a panther does to bite your neck and stop</v>

372
00:11:36.241 --> 00:11:40.020
<v Speaker 1>your life and then consume you and they don't do that because for two reasons.</v>

373
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.870
<v Speaker 1>One thing is probably because they're so fucking big and powerful.</v>

374
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like they don't really have any enemies like,</v>

375
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.170
<v Speaker 1>besides man,</v>

376
00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:46.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

377
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.090
<v Speaker 1>So they don't feel like once they got.</v>

378
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:48.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

379
00:11:48.181 --> 00:11:49.620
<v Speaker 1>they just take the time and eat,</v>

380
00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:50.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

381
00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.500
<v Speaker 1>and they're so strong that like a deer can't really hurt them,</v>

382
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:53.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

383
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 1>for bear gets a hold of a deer.</v>

384
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:55.931
<v Speaker 1>That deer.</v>

385
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:56.031
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

386
00:11:56.031 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 1>good luck swatting at kicking and,</v>

387
00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:58.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

388
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.170
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

389
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 1>a deer kicking can fuck up.</v>

390
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:03.250
<v Speaker 1>A mountain lion could kick him in the face,</v>

391
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 1>break his jaw,</v>

392
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.560
<v Speaker 1>and then was the mountain lion.</v>

393
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:05.771
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

394
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:06.371
<v Speaker 1>he's fucked.</v>

395
00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:06.941
<v Speaker 1>He can't eat.</v>

396
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 1>He's going to starve to death.</v>

397
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.160
<v Speaker 1>So the mountain lion,</v>

398
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:12.550
<v Speaker 1>it's imperative for to take that deer out as quickly and cleanly as possible.</v>

399
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 1>They go white for the neck,</v>

400
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 1>they roll onto the body.</v>

401
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:15.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

402
00:12:15.461 --> 00:12:16.660
<v Speaker 1>it's really like a Jujitsu move.</v>

403
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:18.230
<v Speaker 1>They choke the life out of you.</v>

404
00:12:18.231 --> 00:12:19.300
<v Speaker 1>They always go for the neck.</v>

405
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.150
<v Speaker 1>They don't try to take you out like in the middle of your back,</v>

406
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:22.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

407
00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:22.551
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

408
00:12:22.551 --> 00:12:24.760
<v Speaker 1>they go right where it's going to be the quickest,</v>

409
00:12:24.761 --> 00:12:25.594
<v Speaker 1>most effective way.</v>

410
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Bears on do that.</v>

411
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 1>They just started eating you.</v>

412
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.130
<v Speaker 1>They just hold you down and start eating.</v>

413
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:31.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

414
00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.240
<v Speaker 2>Grizzly bears,</v>

415
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

416
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

417
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:34.710
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

418
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.060
<v Speaker 2>I was in Alaska two years.</v>

419
00:12:36.061 --> 00:12:38.910
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot more than I should about bears probably,</v>

420
00:12:38.911 --> 00:12:42.750
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the reason a lot of people survive grizzly bear attacks,</v>

421
00:12:42.751 --> 00:12:44.430
<v Speaker 2>but not black bear attacks.</v>

422
00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:45.151
<v Speaker 2>Two reasons.</v>

423
00:12:45.151 --> 00:12:45.391
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

424
00:12:45.391 --> 00:12:46.650
<v Speaker 2>black bears climb trees.</v>

425
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:47.903
<v Speaker 2>Grizzlies don't.</v>

426
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.140
<v Speaker 2>So you can't climb a tree.</v>

427
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.320
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing is grizzlies will often,</v>

428
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.760
<v Speaker 2>and this ties into what you're saying,</v>

429
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.650
<v Speaker 2>grizzlies will often think they killed you and then they'll kick some dirt over</v>

430
00:12:58.651 --> 00:13:01.260
<v Speaker 2>you so you can play dead with a grizzly.</v>

431
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.520
<v Speaker 2>They'll kick some dirt over you.</v>

432
00:13:02.521 --> 00:13:07.521
<v Speaker 2>And often they'll come back later because they like the meat putrefying French</v>

433
00:13:07.861 --> 00:13:08.694
<v Speaker 2>cheese.</v>

434

440
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.790
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a must be Dha.</v>

441
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Is it to hide or to accentuate the process?</v>

442
00:13:19.161 --> 00:13:19.491
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

<v Speaker 1>for the face of the planet,</v>

451
00:13:31.881 --> 00:13:35.240
<v Speaker 1>but the only reason why we love them is because they're not in our lives on a</v>

452
00:13:35.241 --> 00:13:36.074
<v Speaker 1>daily basis.</v>

620
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I've been reading it over the past few months.</v>

621
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

622
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.500
<v Speaker 1>along with the new Steve Rinella book meat eater.</v>

623
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I can throw you back and forth with this book.</v>

624
00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.611
<v Speaker 1>It's a great book,</v>

625
00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:00.010
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

626
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.590
<v Speaker 1>There's so much interesting shit in it.</v>

627
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

628
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:07.430
<v Speaker 1>it's such a fascinating sort of exposure about sexuality and evolution and how</v>

629
00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:09.780
<v Speaker 1>we sort of evolved and how we've,</v>

630
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:10.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

631
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:15.530
<v Speaker 1>got to this point where it's kind of gotten away from us and there's all this.</v>

632
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I think Duncan trussell said it best.</v>

633
00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:20.670
<v Speaker 1>He said that you exercise shame from people.</v>

634
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.010
<v Speaker 1>You know what that term,</v>

635
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.430
<v Speaker 1>until I told you I'm working on a new website using squarespace,</v>

636
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.170
<v Speaker 1>which is not bullshit.</v>

637
00:18:28.171 --> 00:18:29.004
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that,</v>

638
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:30.751
<v Speaker 2>but my,</v>

639
00:18:30.751 --> 00:18:30.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

640
00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:34.140
<v Speaker 2>we've got Chris Ryan and then under it says a author,</v>

641
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.970
<v Speaker 2>public speaker or something.</v>

642
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:41.530
<v Speaker 1>I love that phrase.</v>

643
00:18:41.531 --> 00:18:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

644
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.833
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

645
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:43.810
<v Speaker 1>That book is.</v>

646
00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

647
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.030
<v Speaker 1>For a lot of people it makes you go,</v>

648
00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:46.571
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

649
00:18:46.571 --> 00:18:46.811
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

650
00:18:46.811 --> 00:18:48.820
<v Speaker 1>That's why these fucked up thoughts or come,</v>

651
00:18:48.821 --> 00:18:49.631
<v Speaker 1>I'm not fucked up.</v>

652
00:18:49.631 --> 00:18:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's system's fucked up.</v>

653
00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:52.601
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

654
00:18:52.601 --> 00:18:56.050
<v Speaker 1>we're living in this crazy time of shame,</v>

655
00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.470
<v Speaker 1>chime of a</v>

656
00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.520
<v Speaker 1>oddly defined identities and roles that we're supposed to take on.</v>

657
00:19:03.521 --> 00:19:04.900
<v Speaker 1>That seemed very unnatural.</v>

658
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:05.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

659
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.473
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

660
00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.350
<v Speaker 1>it's weird times.</v>

661
00:19:08.351 --> 00:19:09.760
<v Speaker 1>We live in weird time sexually.</v>

662
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.633
<v Speaker 2>I think we do,</v>

663
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:11.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

664
00:19:11.271 --> 00:19:12.230
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese thing,</v>

665
00:19:12.231 --> 00:19:12.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

666
00:19:12.411 --> 00:19:13.910
<v Speaker 2>may you live in interesting times,</v>

667
00:19:13.911 --> 00:19:14.870
<v Speaker 2>which is a curse,</v>

668
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

669
00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.820
<v Speaker 2>but I think we do.</v>

670
00:19:16.821 --> 00:19:18.500
<v Speaker 2>We do live in very interesting times.</v>

671
00:19:18.501 --> 00:19:20.510
<v Speaker 2>There's a quote we use in the book from the playwright,</v>

672
00:19:20.511 --> 00:19:21.231
<v Speaker 2>Arthur Miller,</v>

673
00:19:21.231 --> 00:19:23.390
<v Speaker 2>who was married to Marilyn Monroe for awhile.</v>

674
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:24.430
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

675
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

676
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.920
<v Speaker 2>an era can be considered over when it's basic.</v>

677
00:19:27.921 --> 00:19:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Illusions have been exhausted.</v>

678
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:31.070
<v Speaker 2>I'd love that quote.</v>

679
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.730
<v Speaker 2>It's basic illusions who have been experienced and I think we live in a time</v>

680
00:19:34.731 --> 00:19:38.660
<v Speaker 2>where pretty much all our basic illusions are exhausted politics.</v>

681
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Nobody thinks they're the shit that's going on in Washington is anything other</v>

682
00:19:42.861 --> 00:19:43.281
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

683
00:19:43.281 --> 00:19:43.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

684
00:19:43.551 --> 00:19:45.260
<v Speaker 2>back the yield trading for whatever,</v>

685
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

686
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm banking,</v>

687
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.990
<v Speaker 2>nobody believes banking is for the good of the country anymore.</v>

688
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like people have realized that everyone's on the take.</v>

689
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:59.770
<v Speaker 2>The institutions are not respected and that includes marriage to a large extent.</v>

690
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:05.410
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this struggle going on over marriage and monogamy and gay rights,</v>

691
00:20:05.411 --> 00:20:05.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

692
00:20:05.741 --> 00:20:07.940
<v Speaker 2>in terms of a same sex marriage.</v>

693
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.460
<v Speaker 2>So I think we're in this war.</v>

694
00:20:10.461 --> 00:20:11.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many things,</v>

695
00:20:11.571 --> 00:20:12.050
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>

696
00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:12.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

697
00:20:12.291 --> 00:20:15.530
<v Speaker 2>you're on the forefront of a lot of this sort of recalibrating,</v>

698
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:16.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

699
00:20:16.411 --> 00:20:17.211
<v Speaker 2>what works,</v>

700
00:20:17.211 --> 00:20:17.871
<v Speaker 2>what's right,</v>

701
00:20:17.871 --> 00:20:20.330
<v Speaker 2>what actually has benefits,</v>

702
00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:20.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

703
00:20:20.751 --> 00:20:23.630
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to the bullshit that we're being fed all the time.</v>

704
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.231
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

705
00:20:24.231 --> 00:20:27.020
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of that's due to the Internet probably,</v>

706
00:20:27.021 --> 00:20:27.750
<v Speaker 2>that you can,</v>

707
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

708
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.630
<v Speaker 2>if your message is strong enough,</v>

709
00:20:29.631 --> 00:20:30.790
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter who you are,</v>

710
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.700
<v Speaker 2>who's backing you,</v>

711
00:20:31.701 --> 00:20:32.930
<v Speaker 2>you can reach people.</v>

712
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.921
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>

713
00:20:33.921 --> 00:20:34.131
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

714
00:20:34.131 --> 00:20:35.990
<v Speaker 2>I think we're in really interesting times.</v>

715
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:40.900
<v Speaker 1>It's an effect on our culture of that the workforce,</v>

716
00:20:40.901 --> 00:20:42.700
<v Speaker 1>the workplace brings and it's,</v>

717
00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:43.653
<v Speaker 1>excuse me</v>

718
00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:46.803
<v Speaker 1>everyday during the,</v>

719
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:48.670
<v Speaker 1>at the workplace,</v>

720
00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:48.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

721
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:49.541
<v Speaker 1>some of my black,</v>

722
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:50.111
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

723
00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:50.291
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

724
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:50.561
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

725
00:20:50.561 --> 00:20:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Thanks man.</v>

726
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:51.691
<v Speaker 1>That's a beard.</v>

727
00:20:51.691 --> 00:20:52.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a beer at least 10 minutes.</v>

728
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:53.663
<v Speaker 1>Black Butte,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but tea butte.</v>

730
00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a delicious Porter Ale.</v>

731
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.850
<v Speaker 1>I would like to have one of those and get moved.</v>

732
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:01.990
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

735
00:21:02.491 --> 00:21:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I drank some of that for the first time when I was a man.</v>

736
00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I want to say Chicago where I think it was in Chicago.</v>

737
00:21:09.641 --> 00:21:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

738
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.820
<v Speaker 1>It was like the greatest beer I've ever had in my life from bend,</v>

739
00:21:12.821 --> 00:21:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Oregon.</v>

740
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

741
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:14.680
<v Speaker 1>What's the name of the company?</v>

742
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.110

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

746
00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:19.923
<v Speaker 1>how dare you.</v>

747
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.460
<v Speaker 1>They should be a sponsor.</v>

748
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.910
<v Speaker 1>How about we just pump them up for free?</v>

749
00:21:24.911 --> 00:21:25.481
<v Speaker 1>For free.</v>

750
00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:25.840
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

751
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.400
<v Speaker 1>well that's good.</v>

752
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.100
<v Speaker 1>It's good beer.</v>

753
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's from a guy who doesn't like porter much.</v>

754
00:21:29.291 --> 00:21:29.951
<v Speaker 1>I was saying earlier,</v>

755
00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:32.200
<v Speaker 1>it's normally kind of heavy and sweet for me,</v>

756
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:32.980
<v Speaker 1>but this is nice.</v>

757
00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

758
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

759
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.061
<v Speaker 1>that's delicious.</v>

760
00:21:34.061 --> 00:21:36.280
<v Speaker 1>What are we talking about before we got off workplace?</v>

761
00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.290
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about workplace.</v>

762
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for the.</v>

763
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.620
<v Speaker 1>I really feel like because of the fact that you have to,</v>

764
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.000
<v Speaker 1>when you're in an office all day,</v>

765
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:43.670
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>

766
00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:44.503
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

767
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.750
<v Speaker 1>with men and women working together,</v>

768
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:51.430
<v Speaker 1>there's this sort of professionalism that you have to project.</v>

769
00:21:51.431 --> 00:21:56.080
<v Speaker 1>There's this sort of fake way of communicating where you,</v>

770
00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:01.110
<v Speaker 1>you've completely eradicated anything sexual from the menu of conversation and</v>

771
00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:04.090
<v Speaker 1>even discussing it in the periphery,</v>

772
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.770
<v Speaker 1>dancing around it with a joke can easily get you fired or you know,</v>

773
00:22:08.771 --> 00:22:10.480
<v Speaker 1>about this dongle gate thing.</v>

774
00:22:10.481 --> 00:22:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Are you aware of this memo?</v>

775
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.940
<v Speaker 1>I've heard reference to it,</v>

776
00:22:12.941 --> 00:22:14.100
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't looked into it.</v>

777
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:19.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating story that has taken place over the last few days in the tech</v>

778
00:22:20.711 --> 00:22:21.220
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

779
00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.053
<v Speaker 1>There was a woman,</v>

780
00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.730
<v Speaker 1>a self professed feminist blogger.</v>

781
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.081
<v Speaker 1>Woman's.</v>

782
00:22:27.081 --> 00:22:27.531
<v Speaker 1>Sorry folks.</v>

783
00:22:27.531 --> 00:22:28.364
<v Speaker 1>I've got a little phlegm,</v>

784
00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy,</v>

785
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.551
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

786
00:22:29.551 --> 00:22:29.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

787
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.240
<v Speaker 1>some tissues I gotta blow my nose.</v>

788
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

789
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.880
<v Speaker 1>This woman was at a conference and some men behind her made a joke about</v>

790
00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:37.780
<v Speaker 1>dongles.</v>

791
00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:43.220
<v Speaker 1>It was someone said Dongguan says this essentially is that dongle part of</v>

792
00:22:43.451 --> 00:22:44.284
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

793
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.150
<v Speaker 1>But it was what they're essentially doing was I'm doing like a high tech version</v>

794
00:22:49.151 --> 00:22:50.050
<v Speaker 1>of Beavis and butthead.</v>

795
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:51.070
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

796
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.830
<v Speaker 1>dongle biggest dawn was,</v>

797
00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:54.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

798
00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.361
<v Speaker 1>so these guys,</v>

799
00:22:55.361 --> 00:22:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the joke was,</v>

800
00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:58.623
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

801
00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:03.950
<v Speaker 1>So she takes a photo of these guys and then puts that photo online and says,</v>

802
00:23:05.471 --> 00:23:05.831
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

803
00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:10.810
<v Speaker 1>these guys are violating the code of conduct for the seminar and these guys are</v>

804
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:12.341
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>

805
00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:12.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

806
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:13.890
<v Speaker 1>in your conference there,</v>

807
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.200
<v Speaker 1>they're making jokes about dongles are not cool.</v>

808
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

809
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:21.070
<v Speaker 1>So these guys get fired and one guy gets fired.</v>

810
00:23:21.071 --> 00:23:25.000
<v Speaker 1>He's got three kids and this woman writes his blog,</v>

811
00:23:25.001 --> 00:23:28.720
<v Speaker 1>sort of justifying like the environment that,</v>

812
00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

813
00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:31.120
<v Speaker 1>that sort of makes cool.</v>

814
00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:34.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's the reason why she decided to come out was because there was a little</v>

815
00:23:34.511 --> 00:23:37.510
<v Speaker 1>girl on stage or a little girl in the room or whatever.</v>

816
00:23:37.511 --> 00:23:38.231
<v Speaker 1>And she was thinking,</v>

817
00:23:38.231 --> 00:23:39.850
<v Speaker 1>what was this little girl?</v>

818
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.120
<v Speaker 1>If I don't stand up and stop this,</v>

819
00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:44.620
<v Speaker 1>what is she going to be exposed to it?</v>

820
00:23:44.621 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Which is of grandiose when you're talking</v>

821
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.200
<v Speaker 4>about Dongles,</v>

822
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 4>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

823
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.340
<v Speaker 4>But what's truly fascinating about this whole thing is a,</v>

824
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.990
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

825
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:57.590
<v Speaker 4>the response by the Internet because the man was fired.</v>

826
00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.120
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

827
00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.360
<v Speaker 4>but don't put those guys online.</v>

828
00:23:59.361 --> 00:23:59.930
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

829
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 4>why are we doing that?</v>

830
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's no need to keep.</v>

831
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:03.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

832
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:03.321
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

833
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:03.531
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

834
00:24:03.531 --> 00:24:05.500
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think they,</v>

835
00:24:05.501 --> 00:24:06.890
<v Speaker 4>they didn't ask to be online.</v>

836
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.830
<v Speaker 4>Those guys never asked to be on those.</v>

837
00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.770
<v Speaker 4>Those photos were taken by this woman and it turned into this big thing.</v>

838
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.730
<v Speaker 4>She has like an online media thing that she does already.</v>

839
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:18.620
<v Speaker 4>So she is like a big presence,</v>

840
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.120
<v Speaker 4>a lot of twitter followers.</v>

841
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:25.540
<v Speaker 4>And she just took a photo of these guys and just put them out in the world for</v>

842
00:24:25.671 --> 00:24:26.230
<v Speaker 4>no reason.</v>

843
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean they didn't ask for it and she says,</v>

844
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.260
<v Speaker 4>here's the guys that tell the Dongle joke.</v>

845
00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.150
<v Speaker 4>So one guy gets fired.</v>

846
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:37.000
<v Speaker 4>She writes this crazy blog and anonymous jumps in there,</v>

847
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.500
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

848
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:37.910
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

849
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:38.930
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>

850
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.690
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

851
00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:40.130
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

852
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:44.870
<v Speaker 4>this is absolutely fucking posture is the way this woman's behaving is</v>

853
00:24:44.871 --> 00:24:45.681
<v Speaker 4>repulsive.</v>

854
00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:47.840
<v Speaker 4>And it just went off.</v>

855
00:24:47.841 --> 00:24:51.550
<v Speaker 4>And so they threatened the company and they said they were going to go after</v>

856
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.960
<v Speaker 4>their clients and they were gonna,</v>

857
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

858
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.620
<v Speaker 4>denial of service attacks and whatever they were going to do.</v>

859
00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:56.330
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

860
00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:00.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you need even directly threatened it or indirectly threaten it,</v>

861
00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:01.041
<v Speaker 4>but they're like,</v>

862
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:01.450
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

863
00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:01.880
<v Speaker 4>you got to,</v>

864
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.713
<v Speaker 4>this is just the beginning.</v>

865
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.770
<v Speaker 4>You've got to get rid of this check.</v>

866
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.090
<v Speaker 4>And they fired her immediately.</v>

867
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:06.320
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

868
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.210
<v Speaker 4>I thought you meant the company that fired the guy.</v>

869
00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:09.140
<v Speaker 4>Did they different kinds of.</v>

870
00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they brought the guy back,</v>

871
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.481
<v Speaker 4>but you really,</v>

872
00:25:11.481 --> 00:25:14.000
<v Speaker 4>the guy should get a job at a company that's not a bunch of fucking pussies</v>

873
00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.660
<v Speaker 4>because that's the most ridiculous shit ever.</v>

874
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:17.090
<v Speaker 4>And one man,</v>

875
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.021
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

876
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:20.060
<v Speaker 4>Like it's nothing.</v>

877
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:21.223
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

878
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:21.650
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

879
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:22.220
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

880
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.140
<v Speaker 4>I haven't had a job since the eighties,</v>

881
00:25:24.141 --> 00:25:25.790
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not the guy that really,</v>

882
00:25:25.791 --> 00:25:26.624
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

883
00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.840
<v Speaker 4>but I can't imagine pissing into a cup to have a job.</v>

884
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand that drug test,</v>

885
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.650
<v Speaker 4>drug test for insanity and complete insanity.</v>

886
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:38.390
<v Speaker 4>The fuck does it matter if I smoked a joint two weeks ago and I come into work</v>

887
00:25:38.391 --> 00:25:38.721
<v Speaker 4>today,</v>

888
00:25:38.721 --> 00:25:40.400
<v Speaker 4>what the hell are we talking about?</v>

889
00:25:40.401 --> 00:25:41.270
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>

890
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.840
<v Speaker 4>Complete total insanity and it's just this sort of</v>

891
00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:51.110
<v Speaker 4>designed to get people moving in this direction of blind obedience and that's</v>

892
00:25:51.111 --> 00:25:52.430
<v Speaker 4>what your employer would like for you.</v>

893
00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.541
<v Speaker 4>But by the way,</v>

894
00:25:53.541 --> 00:25:57.080
<v Speaker 4>I think that's another one of these basic illusions that's exhausted.</v>

895
00:25:57.081 --> 00:25:59.840
<v Speaker 4>We got ran Paul coming out for legalizing drugs.</v>

896
00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

897
00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 4>I just saw the headline.</v>

898
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:02.661
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

899
00:26:02.661 --> 00:26:03.110
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>

900
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:05.510
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe we've turned a corner.</v>

901
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.270
<v Speaker 4>It's gotten so crazy that,</v>

902
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.571
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

903
00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:09.800
<v Speaker 4>anonymous is standing up.</v>

904
00:26:09.801 --> 00:26:10.370
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

905
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:15.020
<v Speaker 4>I think the Internet represents the real mind of the people today and I think</v>

906
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:15.740
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

907
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:19.910
<v Speaker 4>when a big movement like this sweeps across the Internet,</v>

908
00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:21.230
<v Speaker 4>and this is a very minor one,</v>

909
00:26:21.231 --> 00:26:22.550
<v Speaker 4>let's go with a major one.</v>

910
00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:23.550
<v Speaker 4>Let's go with wikileaks.</v>

911
00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:29.820
<v Speaker 4>The overwhelming support of Wiki leaks by people online as opposed to how it's</v>

912
00:26:30.201 --> 00:26:33.050
<v Speaker 4>represented in the mainstream media is a big difference,</v>

913
00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.090
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

914
00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:34.760
<v Speaker 4>People Online,</v>

915
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.470
<v Speaker 4>it's like people 35 and under.</v>

916
00:26:36.471 --> 00:26:37.220
<v Speaker 4>Mostly.</v>

917
00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so anymore.</v>

918
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.751
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

919
00:26:38.751 --> 00:26:40.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's applicable anymore.</v>

920
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.660
<v Speaker 4>I think pretty much everybody's online.</v>

921
00:26:41.661 --> 00:26:44.820
<v Speaker 4>I think there's been over the last decade there's been this assimilation towards</v>

922
00:26:44.821 --> 00:26:48.450
<v Speaker 4>older and older folks and then the people who are 30 or now 40 and that's just,</v>

923
00:26:48.451 --> 00:26:48.691
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

924
00:26:48.691 --> 00:26:49.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

925
00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.280
<v Speaker 4>I think the ideas are too powerful and the method of distribution is too</v>

926
00:26:54.541 --> 00:26:58.350
<v Speaker 4>powerful and now we're dealing with this ancient paradigm that doesn't,</v>

927
00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.620
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't really work with the amount of information that we have today.</v>

928
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.800
<v Speaker 4>It's like this old car that we're trying to keep fixing and putting new tires on</v>

929
00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.040
<v Speaker 4>your fucking model t it's a piece of shit it worse.</v>

930
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:13.860
<v Speaker 4>Cuba as Cuba's got least cool cars,</v>

931
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.110
<v Speaker 4>they really take care of.</v>

932
00:27:16.111 --> 00:27:16.944
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

933
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:22.310
<v Speaker 4>it's an amazing model of like recycling and true recycling and the unnecessary</v>

934
00:27:24.151 --> 00:27:27.780
<v Speaker 4>aspects of constantly getting new and improved things.</v>

935
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:32.870
<v Speaker 4>A friend of mine wrote a book called the Chase Chevrolet and Castro's oldsmobile</v>

936
00:27:34.621 --> 00:27:35.371
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>

937
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:35.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

938
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:36.930
<v Speaker 4>his name is Richard Schweid.</v>

939
00:27:36.931 --> 00:27:37.081
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

940
00:27:37.081 --> 00:27:38.520
<v Speaker 4>he's written this guy so interesting.</v>

941
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.440
<v Speaker 4>He's published seven books,</v>

942
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.480
<v Speaker 4>one on Chili peppers,</v>

943
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.860
<v Speaker 4>one on cockroaches,</v>

944
00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:44.510
<v Speaker 4>one on,</v>

945
00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:44.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

946
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:45.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

947
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.470
<v Speaker 4>life after death.</v>

948
00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.390
<v Speaker 4>One on Cuban cars,</v>

949
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.100
<v Speaker 4>he just like w eels,</v>

950
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:50.993
<v Speaker 4>he's got a book on,</v>

951
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.230
<v Speaker 4>he just like gets a hair up his ass and decide something's interesting and he'll</v>

952
00:27:55.231 --> 00:27:58.920
<v Speaker 4>just run it down and write a book about it and then move onto something else.</v>

953
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:59.780
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

954
00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:00.320
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

955
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:00.620
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

956
00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.790
<v Speaker 4>what I was saying earlier before I got,</v>

957
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:07.850
<v Speaker 4>before I got sidetracked about the workplace is that the suppression of your</v>

958
00:28:08.161 --> 00:28:09.990
<v Speaker 4>true humanity in the workplace,</v>

959
00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:10.280
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

960
00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.990
<v Speaker 4>your ability to be free and to be yourself and to be,</v>

961
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.030
<v Speaker 4>to joke around and have fun,</v>

962
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.960
<v Speaker 4>especially when there's intersects politics when there's,</v>

963
00:28:18.961 --> 00:28:19.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

964
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:22.140
<v Speaker 4>there's a cross of men and women working together.</v>

965
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:27.410
<v Speaker 4>There's this sort of like fakeness that goes on all day and then there's this</v>

966
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:33.280
<v Speaker 4>other level of fakeness that goes on when you're out in the night lifetime</v>

967
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.530
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to get laid like,</v>

968
00:28:34.531 --> 00:28:36.510
<v Speaker 4>so there's that fakeness as well.</v>

969
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.720
<v Speaker 4>And there's just such a small percentage of time that humans,</v>

970
00:28:42.001 --> 00:28:45.660
<v Speaker 4>men and women throughout the day interact with each other on a truly honest</v>

971
00:28:45.661 --> 00:28:46.494
<v Speaker 4>level,</v>

972
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:46.681
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

973
00:28:46.681 --> 00:28:51.180
<v Speaker 4>So like it takes fucking decades to understand each other.</v>

974
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:56.340
<v Speaker 4>It takes decades as a man under just try to wrap your head around the idea of</v>

975
00:28:56.341 --> 00:29:00.360
<v Speaker 4>wanting babies growing inside of you and wanting dicks and you know,</v>

976
00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:01.320
<v Speaker 4>and being attracted to men.</v>

977
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:02.610
<v Speaker 4>Just wrapping your head around that.</v>

978
00:29:02.611 --> 00:29:07.611
<v Speaker 4>It's a very strange concept because we bullshit each other all day at work</v>

979
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.740
<v Speaker 4>before because we bullshit each other when we'd go out on dates.</v>

980
00:29:10.741 --> 00:29:12.000
<v Speaker 4>So social events,</v>

981
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:13.490
<v Speaker 4>we pretend to be someone you know,</v>

982
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.740
<v Speaker 4>more sophisticated or interesting than we truly are.</v>

983
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:17.490
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

984
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:19.760
<v Speaker 4>I think that the amount,</v>

985
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:24.030
<v Speaker 4>the amount of time it takes before you start understanding how people really are</v>

986
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:29.240
<v Speaker 4>as opposed to these bizarre patterns that we keep following,</v>

987
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

988
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:30.683
<v Speaker 4>it seems,</v>

989
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.160
<v Speaker 4>and you didn't even mention media.</v>

990
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.790
<v Speaker 4>All the bullshit media pumps into us about each other.</v>

991
00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:39.990
<v Speaker 4>Men and women have a unique relationship with,</v>

992
00:29:39.991 --> 00:29:40.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

993
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.470
<v Speaker 4>with television.</v>

994
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 4>And then had been</v>

995
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.260
<v Speaker 5>on a couple shows that went on a long time.</v>

996
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:49.020
<v Speaker 5>I was on news radio for five years and then it was on fear factor for six years</v>

997
00:29:49.021 --> 00:29:50.530
<v Speaker 5>or so when people say,</v>

998
00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:50.981
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

999
00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:54.250
<v Speaker 5>there's a conspiracy and the government's trying to dumb us down through</v>

1000
00:29:54.251 --> 00:29:55.084
<v Speaker 5>television.</v>

1001
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:56.920
<v Speaker 5>That's not what's happening.</v>

1002
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 5>What's happening is that's what you're buying,</v>

1003
00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:02.170
<v Speaker 5>that's what they're selling because that's what you're buying and that's one of</v>

1004
00:30:02.171 --> 00:30:05.200
<v Speaker 5>the reasons why it's gotten darker and weirder over the past few years.</v>

1005
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.680
<v Speaker 5>Just because you're on the Internet now and the walking dead could not have</v>

1006
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:10.270
<v Speaker 5>fucking existed a decade ago.</v>

1007
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.220
<v Speaker 5>No way you could have that on television.</v>

1008
00:30:12.221 --> 00:30:14.590
<v Speaker 5>I saw a dude get his leg hacked off with a hatchet,</v>

1009
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:15.260
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1010
00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:15.551
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1011
00:30:15.551 --> 00:30:17.950
<v Speaker 5>you see shit.</v>

1012
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:23.110
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't believe what was the sheer violence and insanity of the walking dead</v>

1013
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:27.070
<v Speaker 5>is impossible without the internet and video games.</v>

1014
00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:28.541
<v Speaker 5>Video Games,</v>

1015
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:30.700
<v Speaker 5>absolutely these uncensored environments,</v>

1016
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.830
<v Speaker 5>but that information's there now,</v>

1017
00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.350
<v Speaker 5>so they have to adjust and change things,</v>

1018
00:30:35.351 --> 00:30:40.090
<v Speaker 5>but the reason why fear factor existed or or CSI exists,</v>

1019
00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:44.260
<v Speaker 5>it's not that the government is like trying to convince you.</v>

1020
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.340
<v Speaker 5>If you make a mistake,</v>

1021
00:30:45.341 --> 00:30:46.270
<v Speaker 5>we'll catch you.</v>

1022
00:30:46.271 --> 00:30:48.520
<v Speaker 5>We can take your fingerprints from the air,</v>

1023
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.031
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1024
00:30:49.031 --> 00:30:49.500
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1025
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:49.941
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1026
00:30:49.941 --> 00:30:50.171
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1027
00:30:50.171 --> 00:30:50.351
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1028
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:50.531
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1029
00:30:50.531 --> 00:30:50.800
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1030
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.200
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

1031
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.060
<v Speaker 5>that's what you want.</v>

1032
00:30:52.061 --> 00:30:53.140
<v Speaker 5>You want crime shows.</v>

1033
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.460
<v Speaker 5>You're buying crime shows.</v>

1034
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:58.240
<v Speaker 5>If you buy crime shows because you're scared because you look what's happening</v>

1035
00:30:58.241 --> 00:31:00.160
<v Speaker 5>in the world will hold what if the bad guy,</v>

1036
00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:05.220
<v Speaker 5>so you're living your life in these weird paranoid ideas through this artificial</v>

1037
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:06.364
<v Speaker 5>medium,</v>

1038
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.290
<v Speaker 5>but no one's trying to brainwash you.</v>

1039
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:09.311
<v Speaker 5>You think they are,</v>

1040
00:31:09.311 --> 00:31:13.420
<v Speaker 5>but it's really more a matter of this is what people actually bought and is it</v>

1041
00:31:13.421 --> 00:31:14.950
<v Speaker 5>because that's what they've been sold forever.</v>

1042
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:15.281
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1043
00:31:15.281 --> 00:31:15.970
<v Speaker 5>that too.</v>

1044
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:16.860
<v Speaker 5>Definitely that too,</v>

1045
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.060
<v Speaker 5>but there's a lot of dummies out there.</v>

1046
00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.550
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of domains that just want to sit in front of the TV and watch</v>

1047
00:31:21.551 --> 00:31:24.460
<v Speaker 5>someone get go to what's going to happen on law and order.</v>

1048
00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:27.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to guess the bad guy's going to lose because I'm.</v>

1049
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:29.600
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1050
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:29.960
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1051
00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:30.793
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

1052
00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:33.890
<v Speaker 2>Although I do think that there is.</v>

1053
00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:35.270
<v Speaker 2>It's not brainwashing,</v>

1054
00:31:35.271 --> 00:31:39.110
<v Speaker 2>but I think who was at Marshall Mcluhan said the medium is the message,</v>

1055
00:31:39.111 --> 00:31:39.321
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1056
00:31:39.321 --> 00:31:39.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1057
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:42.550
<v Speaker 2>So there's certain things that you sell that are,</v>

1058
00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.960
<v Speaker 2>that are easier to sell through TV.</v>

1059
00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.490
<v Speaker 2>So you sell those.</v>

1060
00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.330
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1061
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.240
<v Speaker 2>and they're the structure.</v>

1062
00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:51.291
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1063
00:31:51.291 --> 00:31:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm reading this book now,</v>

1064
00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:53.180
<v Speaker 2>civilized to death.</v>

1065
00:31:53.181 --> 00:31:53.591
<v Speaker 2>It's called him,</v>

1066
00:31:53.591 --> 00:31:55.100
<v Speaker 2>so I'm really like deep into the shit,</v>

1067
00:31:55.101 --> 00:32:00.101
<v Speaker 2>but it's like there are institutions are organic beings,</v>

1068
00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.480
<v Speaker 2>companies are organic beings,</v>

1069
00:32:02.481 --> 00:32:03.830
<v Speaker 2>so they,</v>

1070
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.520
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>

1071
00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.351
<v Speaker 2>they sell the,</v>

1072
00:32:05.351 --> 00:32:07.360
<v Speaker 2>they provide what sells because they're,</v>

1073
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:08.180
<v Speaker 2>they need to eat,</v>

1074
00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.230
<v Speaker 2>they need to feed,</v>

1075
00:32:09.231 --> 00:32:09.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1076
00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.753
<v Speaker 2>and grow.</v>

1077
00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.130
<v Speaker 2>But I do think that there are structural,</v>

1078
00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:13.761
<v Speaker 2>how can I say it,</v>

1079
00:32:13.761 --> 00:32:15.710
<v Speaker 2>like structural biases that,</v>

1080
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:18.010
<v Speaker 2>that divert or,</v>

1081
00:32:18.011 --> 00:32:18.381
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1082
00:32:18.381 --> 00:32:18.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1083
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:19.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1084
00:32:19.071 --> 00:32:23.930
<v Speaker 2>sort of focus the media in different ways and I think Internet is great because</v>

1085
00:32:23.931 --> 00:32:25.250
<v Speaker 2>it's so dispersed.</v>

1086
00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.080
<v Speaker 2>Whereas TV is very,</v>

1087
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm selling to you.</v>

1088
00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:30.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't hear a thing you say,</v>

1089
00:32:30.741 --> 00:32:33.200
<v Speaker 2>except through Nielsen ratings or some shit like that.</v>

1090
00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:35.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're getting smoke signals.</v>

1091
00:32:35.151 --> 00:32:36.320
<v Speaker 2>They're not getting a conversation.</v>

1092
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:37.461
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the Internet,</v>

1093
00:32:37.461 --> 00:32:37.791
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1094
00:32:37.791 --> 00:32:38.091
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1095
00:32:38.091 --> 00:32:38.901
<v Speaker 2>you've got clicks.</v>

1096
00:32:38.901 --> 00:32:39.651
<v Speaker 2>You eyes,</v>

1097
00:32:39.651 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 2>you can</v>

1098
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.060
<v Speaker 6>measure everything.</v>

1099
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.160
<v Speaker 6>That's interesting.</v>

1100
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.671
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1101
00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:43.941
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1102
00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:44.540
<v Speaker 6>absolutely.</v>

1103
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.680
<v Speaker 6>The idea of,</v>

1104
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:46.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1105
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.420
<v Speaker 6>this is what we're going to offer you.</v>

1106
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:52.250
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't exist on the internet and the choices are so vast that and the</v>

1107
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.280
<v Speaker 6>freedom that anybody like you have a podcast,</v>

1108
00:32:55.281 --> 00:32:56.114
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1109
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.830
<v Speaker 6>Generally speaking,</v>

1110
00:32:57.831 --> 00:32:58.401
<v Speaker 6>as you can tell,</v>

1111
00:32:58.401 --> 00:32:59.330
<v Speaker 6>it's my style.</v>

1112
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.770
<v Speaker 6>What's your preference for this podcast?</v>

1113
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.810
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1114
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:06.290
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1115
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:06.570
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1116
00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:06.891
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1117
00:33:06.891 --> 00:33:07.191
<v Speaker 6>any,</v>

1118
00:33:07.191 --> 00:33:10.220
<v Speaker 6>anything along these lines that the youtube videos that people have the young</v>

1119
00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:12.530
<v Speaker 6>Turks or have these video.</v>

1120
00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.760
<v Speaker 6>My last episode was with the Young Turks that couldn't have existed.</v>

1121
00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:17.361
<v Speaker 6>We talked about.</v>

1122
00:33:17.361 --> 00:33:17.760
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1123
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.640
<v Speaker 6>are they like you,</v>

1124
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.320
<v Speaker 6>it couldn't have existed without,</v>

1125
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.640
<v Speaker 6>without the Youtube possibility,</v>

1126
00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:25.430
<v Speaker 6>the Internet possibility without,</v>

1127
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:25.900
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

1128
00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.680
<v Speaker 6>without that sort of a platform.</v>

1129
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:32.990
<v Speaker 6>And I think that sort of overwhelming the old paradigm and it's slowly starting</v>

1130
00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:34.910
<v Speaker 6>to a road.</v>

1131
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:36.230
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1132
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.721
<v Speaker 6>but I,</v>

1133
00:33:36.721 --> 00:33:39.020
<v Speaker 6>I also feel that the workplace,</v>

1134
00:33:39.021 --> 00:33:39.681
<v Speaker 6>like people,</v>

1135
00:33:39.681 --> 00:33:43.430
<v Speaker 6>people having to bullshit all day is counterproductive to it.</v>

1136
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:47.120
<v Speaker 6>And it becomes a major part of your awake time program.</v>

1137
00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:47.780
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1138
00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.090
<v Speaker 6>It's so American.</v>

1139
00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:50.810
<v Speaker 6>I have to say in Spain,</v>

1140
00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.153
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1141
00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.530
<v Speaker 6>I can't speak for Spain in general,</v>

1142
00:33:54.531 --> 00:33:55.550
<v Speaker 6>but I've been there 20 years.</v>

1143
00:33:55.551 --> 00:33:55.940
<v Speaker 6>So I,</v>

1144
00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:56.111
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1145
00:33:56.111 --> 00:33:56.360
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1146
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:56.840
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>

1147
00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.260
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty well familiar with the culture,</v>

1148
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:05.710
<v Speaker 6>but it's one of the things I love about Spain is that politically correct sort</v>

1149
00:34:06.351 --> 00:34:06.910
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

1150
00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:07.160
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1151
00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:12.160
<v Speaker 6>men are the enemies of women and adolescent joking can get you fired from your</v>

1152
00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:12.950
<v Speaker 6>job.</v>

1153
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:14.720
<v Speaker 6>That isn't happening now.</v>

1154
00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.140
<v Speaker 6>Women could have a legitimate point by saying,</v>

1155
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:18.680
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1156
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:22.850
<v Speaker 6>because women's status in Spain isn't as high as it is in there aren't legal</v>

1157
00:34:22.851 --> 00:34:24.280
<v Speaker 6>protections and that,</v>

1158
00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:24.591
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1159
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:26.990
<v Speaker 6>women get harassed in the street or whatever,</v>

1160
00:34:26.991 --> 00:34:27.830
<v Speaker 6>and that's all true.</v>

1161
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.950
<v Speaker 6>So I don't mean to say Spain is across the board better,</v>

1162
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:33.910
<v Speaker 6>but one thing I noticed in Spain and I love about Spain,</v>

1163
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.910
<v Speaker 6>is that women,</v>

1164
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:38.240
<v Speaker 6>women don't assume you're a rapist because you smile at them,</v>

1165
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.291
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1166
00:34:39.291 --> 00:34:39.551
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

1167
00:34:39.551 --> 00:34:41.540
<v Speaker 6>they don't assume you've got bad intentions.</v>

1168
00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.140
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

1169
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:45.260
<v Speaker 6>they assume you probably have good intentions and you just find them attractive</v>

1170
00:34:45.261 --> 00:34:47.840
<v Speaker 6>and they smile back and everybody keeps walking and there's no.</v>

1171
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.370
<v Speaker 6>It's like a win win.</v>

1172
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:49.851
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1173
00:34:49.851 --> 00:34:53.000
<v Speaker 6>there's no assumption of victimization going on.</v>

1174
00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.210
<v Speaker 6>I think in America there's this assumption,</v>

1175
00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:56.991
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1176
00:34:56.991 --> 00:34:57.250
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1177
00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:00.500
<v Speaker 6>that you know why there's a little girl on stage and these guys are making a</v>

1178
00:35:00.501 --> 00:35:04.100
<v Speaker 6>dumb ass jokes somehow that's connected and I got to expose this.</v>

1179
00:35:04.101 --> 00:35:04.401
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

1180
00:35:04.401 --> 00:35:07.550
<v Speaker 6>I don't see that in Spain you don't see that sort of shit.</v>

1181
00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.001
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1182
00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:08.261
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1183
00:35:08.261 --> 00:35:08.501
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1184
00:35:08.501 --> 00:35:10.250
<v Speaker 6>the fury that people had was this.</v>

1185
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.540
<v Speaker 6>They weren't joking with her.</v>

1186
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:12.583
<v Speaker 6>They weren't,</v>

1187
00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.580
<v Speaker 6>they were joking amongst themselves and literally the most innocent language</v>

1188
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:21.670
<v Speaker 6>possible for describing a dick or alluding to a dick and that was enough for her</v>

1189
00:35:22.161 --> 00:35:22.640
<v Speaker 6>to go.</v>

1190
00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.250
<v Speaker 6>I've had enough like the.</v>

1191
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:28.670
<v Speaker 6>There's a craziness to that and someone made a video called toxic women and</v>

1192
00:35:28.671 --> 00:35:31.030
<v Speaker 6>stupid men and it's on youtube and deep,</v>

1193
00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:33.230
<v Speaker 6>very in a very intelligent way.</v>

1194
00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 6>Details why people that think like this or a real issue and men who allow</v>

1195
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.680
<v Speaker 5>them to get away with it without saying this is preposterous.</v>

1196
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:42.270
<v Speaker 5>Their real issue too,</v>

1197
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.400
<v Speaker 5>because there's a lot of white nights out there.</v>

1198
00:35:44.401 --> 00:35:49.230
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of really dumb weak dudes that want to pretend that there with the</v>

1199
00:35:49.231 --> 00:35:50.040
<v Speaker 5>girls,</v>

1200
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:50.873
<v Speaker 5>they think like,</v>

1201
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:51.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1202
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:51.661
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>

1203
00:35:51.661 --> 00:35:55.380
<v Speaker 5>These men are assholes and they'll make videos about it and what they're looking</v>

1204
00:35:55.381 --> 00:35:57.060
<v Speaker 5>for is like feminine Brownie points.</v>

1205
00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.310
<v Speaker 5>They want feminist to look at them and say,</v>

1206
00:35:59.311 --> 00:35:59.521
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1207
00:35:59.521 --> 00:36:00.354
<v Speaker 5>you're one of us,</v>

1208
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.600
<v Speaker 5>and it's not necessarily that they don't actually think that way.</v>

1209
00:36:03.601 --> 00:36:04.440
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people are like,</v>

1210
00:36:04.441 --> 00:36:05.080
<v Speaker 5>you're wrong,</v>

1211
00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:05.820
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

1212
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.860
<v Speaker 5>I believe you do think like that,</v>

1213
00:36:07.861 --> 00:36:11.880
<v Speaker 5>but I'm telling you that the motivation for anybody thinking like that is false.</v>

1214
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:12.960
<v Speaker 5>You have a crazy,</v>

1215
00:36:12.961 --> 00:36:14.670
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous way of looking at things.</v>

1216
00:36:14.671 --> 00:36:15.504
<v Speaker 5>It's unbalanced.</v>

1217
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:17.130
<v Speaker 5>If you had no sex whatsoever,</v>

1218
00:36:17.131 --> 00:36:18.660
<v Speaker 5>not male nor female,</v>

1219
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:22.170
<v Speaker 5>and you look at that as two human beings and one human being was fired because</v>

1220
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.350
<v Speaker 5>another human being made a joke about something that was being referenced</v>

1221
00:36:25.351 --> 00:36:27.090
<v Speaker 5>onstage in a playful manner.</v>

1222
00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.010
<v Speaker 5>Should that person be taking sex out of it?</v>

1223
00:36:29.011 --> 00:36:30.060
<v Speaker 5>Should that person be fired?</v>

1224
00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:30.510
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1225
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:31.680
<v Speaker 5>And if you say yes,</v>

1226
00:36:31.681 --> 00:36:32.514
<v Speaker 5>you're a cunt,</v>

1227
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.970
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1228
00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:34.410
<v Speaker 5>that's the reality of the situation.</v>

1229
00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.210
<v Speaker 5>You're a toxic person.</v>

1230
00:36:36.211 --> 00:36:37.650
<v Speaker 5>That's a shitty way of looking at things.</v>

1231
00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:38.371
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

1232
00:36:38.371 --> 00:36:41.910
<v Speaker 5>I should stress that this woman did not want these guys to be fired and she did</v>

1233
00:36:41.911 --> 00:36:42.930
<v Speaker 5>not think that was her intent.</v>

1234
00:36:42.931 --> 00:36:43.770
<v Speaker 5>She wanted them shut up.</v>

1235
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.260
<v Speaker 5>Whatever is maybe she's self righteous.</v>

1236
00:36:46.261 --> 00:36:48.090
<v Speaker 5>Maybe she likes to go off on tangents.</v>

1237
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.650
<v Speaker 5>I don't think she should be fired.</v>

1238
00:36:49.651 --> 00:36:50.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he should be fired.</v>

1239
00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:53.610
<v Speaker 5>I think it has nothing to do with whatever the fuck they do during the day,</v>

1240
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.880
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's fascinating when people are forced to be behaving in a certain</v>

1241
00:36:59.911 --> 00:37:00.061
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

1242
00:37:00.061 --> 00:37:00.660
<v Speaker 5>Like you're,</v>

1243
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:01.020
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1244
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:04.680
<v Speaker 5>you're locked into this sort of nonsense environment where you can't even talk</v>

1245
00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:05.514
<v Speaker 5>about dongles.</v>

1246
00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1247
00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1248
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:08.330
<v Speaker 2>there's an article on salon.com,</v>

1249
00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I think last week I linked to it and it started this big firestorm on my</v>

1250
00:37:12.381 --> 00:37:17.120
<v Speaker 2>facebook page where a woman wrote about an experience she'd had the first time</v>

1251
00:37:17.121 --> 00:37:17.901
<v Speaker 2>she'd had sex.</v>

1252
00:37:17.901 --> 00:37:21.500
<v Speaker 2>I think she was 15 or something and she was with a guy a couple of years older.</v>

1253
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.401
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1254
00:37:22.401 --> 00:37:22.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1255
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:26.180
<v Speaker 2>she just said she had a few drinks.</v>

1256
00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:26.660
<v Speaker 2>You read it.</v>

1257
00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1258
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.780
<v Speaker 2>And so she was saying that wasn't rape.</v>

1259
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:31.280
<v Speaker 2>I made a bad decision.</v>

1260
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:34.040
<v Speaker 2>I had sex that I later regretted it wasn't rape.</v>

1261
00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.240
<v Speaker 2>And apparently like,</v>

1262
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.690
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1263
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:38.090
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge firestorm around this.</v>

1264
00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:38.681
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1265
00:37:38.681 --> 00:37:39.011
<v Speaker 5>there is.</v>

1266
00:37:39.011 --> 00:37:41.260
<v Speaker 5>Because there's the feminist movement right now.</v>

1267
00:37:41.261 --> 00:37:45.880
<v Speaker 5>Then one of the ideas that they're pushing is the idea that is in place,</v>

1268
00:37:45.881 --> 00:37:47.260
<v Speaker 5>I believe in Sweden.</v>

1269
00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:47.920
<v Speaker 5>Whereas the,</v>

1270
00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1271
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.153
<v Speaker 5>where the,</v>

1272
00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.340
<v Speaker 5>the idea being that regret,</v>

1273
00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:52.300
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1274
00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.420
<v Speaker 5>means that you can withdraw your consent,</v>

1275
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:59.670
<v Speaker 2>which is where a Julian Assan is being accused of rape the woman he is</v>

1276
00:38:00.461 --> 00:38:01.300
<v Speaker 2>supposedly rape,</v>

1277
00:38:01.301 --> 00:38:02.800
<v Speaker 2>went out with them again the next night</v>

1278
00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:07.350
<v Speaker 5>and had sex with them right before what he was being accused of.</v>

1279
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:08.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to speak out of school,</v>

1280
00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:11.040
<v Speaker 5>but I'm pretty sure it was called surprise sex.</v>

1281
00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:15.390
<v Speaker 5>It was the idea they were sleeping and they had sex again without a condom.</v>

1282
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:15.721
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1283
00:38:15.721 --> 00:38:16.351
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

1284
00:38:16.351 --> 00:38:18.660
<v Speaker 5>And she didn't want this or she was upset at this or whatever,</v>

1285
00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:18.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1286
00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:20.820
<v Speaker 5>obviously they were looking to get at him for something else,</v>

1287
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:22.860
<v Speaker 5>but that's about as obvious.</v>

1288
00:38:22.861 --> 00:38:23.730
<v Speaker 5>You can get that one.</v>

1289
00:38:23.731 --> 00:38:25.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean that is just fucking,</v>

1290
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:29.310
<v Speaker 5>it's just so happens that it's the same guy that had no beef with them about</v>

1291
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:30.840
<v Speaker 5>leaking all the information.</v>

1292
00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:32.610
<v Speaker 5>That's cool because there's no law against that.</v>

1293
00:38:32.611 --> 00:38:32.791
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1294
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:33.624
<v Speaker 5>Is that what's going on?</v>

1295
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:35.010
<v Speaker 5>But the other shit you can,</v>

1296
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 5>you can lock them up in a fucking.</v>

1297
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:37.450
<v Speaker 5>Didn't Brenda this morning?</v>

1298
00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:37.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1299
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:38.411
<v Speaker 5>Fuck man.</v>

1300
00:38:38.411 --> 00:38:42.970
<v Speaker 5>They torture Bradley Manning truly torchy's a hero that was in solitary</v>

1301
00:38:42.971 --> 00:38:47.590
<v Speaker 5>confinement for some insane hundreds and hundreds of days with no contact with</v>

1302
00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:48.424
<v Speaker 5>another person,</v>

1303
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.360
<v Speaker 5>which they say literally can make you crazy.</v>

1304
00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:50.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1305
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:51.220
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

1306
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.270
<v Speaker 5>And they wouldn't,</v>

1307
00:38:52.271 --> 00:38:54.280
<v Speaker 5>they would take his clothes off because they thought that he was a security</v>

1308
00:38:54.281 --> 00:38:54.581
<v Speaker 5>risk.</v>

1309
00:38:54.581 --> 00:38:58.690
<v Speaker 5>So he's cold and naked lights all night lights constantly,</v>

1310
00:38:59.020 --> 00:38:59.830
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1311
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:00.460
<v Speaker 5>for what,</v>

1312
00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:05.170
<v Speaker 5>because he did what really his patriotic duty led him to believe that he should</v>

1313
00:39:05.171 --> 00:39:05.860
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

1314
00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:10.860
<v Speaker 5>You should release information that he believes is contrary to the nature of the</v>

1315
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:15.540
<v Speaker 5>contrary to the idea of what most people view of the military as,</v>

1316
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.340
<v Speaker 5>as only good guys over there killing bad guys.</v>

1317
00:39:18.341 --> 00:39:20.170
<v Speaker 5>And contrary to the law.</v>

1318
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:20.830
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1319
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:21.101
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1320
00:39:21.101 --> 00:39:22.900
<v Speaker 5>international and American law.</v>

1321
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:23.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1322
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:24.041
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1323
00:39:24.041 --> 00:39:24.400
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

1324
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.880
<v Speaker 5>what he did was what the New York Times is supposed to do.</v>

1325
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.590
<v Speaker 5>You know what Daniel Ellsberg.</v>

1326
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1327
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:30.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1328
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:31.270
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>

1329
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1330
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.360
<v Speaker 5>so I think the,</v>

1331
00:39:33.361 --> 00:39:33.590
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1332
00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:34.540
<v Speaker 5>the view of that,</v>

1333
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:37.690
<v Speaker 5>that's getting back to the Internet thing on the Internet,</v>

1334
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.410
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty.</v>

1335
00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:38.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1336
00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:42.340
<v Speaker 5>most of the people that I communicate with that's pretty much unanimous.</v>

1337
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:42.851
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1338
00:39:42.851 --> 00:39:44.050
<v Speaker 5>pretty much everybody is like,</v>

1339
00:39:44.051 --> 00:39:44.380
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1340
00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:44.651
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1341
00:39:44.651 --> 00:39:49.651
<v Speaker 5>at the very least this exposes a real issue that should be dealt with in the</v>

1342
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:51.003
<v Speaker 5>military,</v>

1343
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:55.120
<v Speaker 5>but you don't hear that from mainstream media for mainstream media.</v>

1344
00:39:55.121 --> 00:39:57.610
<v Speaker 5>They have eliminated that guy from the discussion.</v>

1345
00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.830
<v Speaker 5>You never hear him being talked about.</v>

1346
00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:00.041
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1347
00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:01.180
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was saying earlier,</v>

1348
00:40:01.181 --> 00:40:06.181
<v Speaker 2>like the structure of the of the institution dictates what information can go</v>

1349
00:40:06.611 --> 00:40:07.061
<v Speaker 2>through there.</v>

1350
00:40:07.061 --> 00:40:08.580
<v Speaker 2>So because of the corporate interest,</v>

1351
00:40:08.581 --> 00:40:13.440
<v Speaker 2>because Ge owns NBC or whatever their and also makes the fucking missiles and</v>

1352
00:40:13.441 --> 00:40:14.770
<v Speaker 2>the helicopters and the rest of it,</v>

1353
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.220
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to be able to take that perspective because they're not</v>

1354
00:40:18.221 --> 00:40:18.900
<v Speaker 2>independent.</v>

1355
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:19.600
<v Speaker 2>That's bullshit,</v>

1356
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1357
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:20.560
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1358
00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.320
<v Speaker 5>as some people like the young Turks come along,</v>

1359
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:25.060
<v Speaker 5>they really become archaic.</v>

1360
00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.450
<v Speaker 5>They don't make any sense anymore because the young Turks will tell you,</v>

1361
00:40:28.451 --> 00:40:28.991
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1362
00:40:28.991 --> 00:40:31.000
<v Speaker 5>they're going to tell you what they believe.</v>

1363
00:40:31.001 --> 00:40:32.650
<v Speaker 5>One hundred percent with that guy believes what?</v>

1364
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.551
<v Speaker 5>They might not be.</v>

1365
00:40:33.551 --> 00:40:34.000
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1366
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:34.571
<v Speaker 5>They may be mean.</v>

1367
00:40:34.571 --> 00:40:35.950
<v Speaker 5>He was off about Breitbart,</v>

1368
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:40.930
<v Speaker 5>about what the whole Andrew Wiener thing he made fun of Breitbart for releasing</v>

1369
00:40:40.931 --> 00:40:41.660
<v Speaker 5>that Jank.</v>

1370
00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1371
00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.560
<v Speaker 5>Saying he's an idiot for doing it and it turned out to be true,</v>

1372
00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:45.551
<v Speaker 5>but you know that,</v>

1373
00:40:45.551 --> 00:40:45.940
<v Speaker 5>that he,</v>

1374
00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:46.630
<v Speaker 5>that's him.</v>

1375
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:47.380
<v Speaker 5>That's him.</v>

1376
00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:47.771
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1377
00:40:47.771 --> 00:40:49.150
<v Speaker 5>He's talking straight to the camera,</v>

1378
00:40:49.151 --> 00:40:51.820
<v Speaker 5>so maybe it doesn't have the correct information at the time,</v>

1379
00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:53.920
<v Speaker 5>but what he's telling you,</v>

1380
00:40:53.921 --> 00:40:56.440
<v Speaker 5>it's not being pushed by producers.</v>

1381
00:40:56.441 --> 00:41:00.250
<v Speaker 5>It's not being pushed by a network not being pushed by a corporate entity behind</v>

1382
00:41:00.251 --> 00:41:01.010
<v Speaker 5>the network.</v>

1383
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:01.220
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1384
00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:05.440
<v Speaker 5>You can't say that about the news that we've come to accept as the mainstream</v>

1385
00:41:05.441 --> 00:41:05.711
<v Speaker 5>news,</v>

1386
00:41:05.711 --> 00:41:07.060
<v Speaker 5>whether it's CNN or Fox.</v>

1387
00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:11.560
<v Speaker 5>There's no individual voice is no individual point of view and you know,</v>

1388
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.540
<v Speaker 5>especially being.</v>

1389
00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.640
<v Speaker 5>Occasionally you'll have people give editorials,</v>

1390
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.160
<v Speaker 5>but those editorials or just Jesus Christ,</v>

1391
00:41:18.161 --> 00:41:18.330
<v Speaker 5>Allah,</v>

1392
00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:18.980
<v Speaker 5>cartoonish.</v>

1393
00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.470
<v Speaker 5>They're cartoonish and nonsensical.</v>

1394
00:41:20.471 --> 00:41:24.700
<v Speaker 5>Especially like Fox News is going to be about the Democrats and Obama is fucking</v>

1395
00:41:24.701 --> 00:41:25.960
<v Speaker 5>up and we turn to socialism.</v>

1396
00:41:25.961 --> 00:41:26.740
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be so hot.</v>

1397
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:27.580
<v Speaker 5>It's so obvious.</v>

1398
00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.810
<v Speaker 5>You don't even have to say it.</v>

1399
00:41:28.811 --> 00:41:31.150
<v Speaker 5>Just show me what color flag you hold them up.</v>

1400
00:41:31.151 --> 00:41:32.730
<v Speaker 5>You've got a red flag or a blue flag.</v>

1401
00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:33.680
<v Speaker 5>I your message.</v>

1402
00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.230
<v Speaker 5>Just show me a red,</v>

1403
00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.560
<v Speaker 5>a flash of red.</v>

1404
00:41:36.561 --> 00:41:40.550
<v Speaker 5>And that idea is basically just as good as whatever the fuck comes out of your</v>

1405
00:41:40.551 --> 00:41:40.910
<v Speaker 5>mouth.</v>

1406
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:41.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1407
00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.070
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to have me back a third time because we're never going to.</v>

1408
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:46.580
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1409
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:47.271
<v Speaker 5>we will though,</v>

1410
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:47.541
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1411
00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:47.991
<v Speaker 5>We will.</v>

1412
00:41:47.991 --> 00:41:48.800
<v Speaker 5>We will.</v>

1413
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.380
<v Speaker 5>But I really wanted to have you one after this.</v>

1414
00:41:51.381 --> 00:41:52.040
<v Speaker 5>This thing,</v>

1415
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.380
<v Speaker 5>this dongle gate broke out because</v>

1416
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:58.730
<v Speaker 5>I think one of the things that your book really,</v>

1417
00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:04.090
<v Speaker 5>really highlights is the weirdness in which women are not supposed to except</v>

1418
00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:09.520
<v Speaker 5>their sexuality or accept the fact that they get horny or broadcasted in any way</v>

1419
00:42:10.551 --> 00:42:12.240
<v Speaker 5>or even you know,</v>

1420
00:42:12.241 --> 00:42:17.241
<v Speaker 5>it acknowledge it and that if there's a sexual joke going on where a man,</v>

1421
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:20.720
<v Speaker 5>even if he doesn't even involve that woman,</v>

1422
00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:22.310
<v Speaker 5>make some sort of a sexual joke,</v>

1423
00:42:22.311 --> 00:42:25.430
<v Speaker 5>that somehow that woman is a victim because she doesn't want to have anything to</v>

1424
00:42:25.431 --> 00:42:26.121
<v Speaker 5>do with sex.</v>

1425
00:42:26.121 --> 00:42:26.750
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1426
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:27.930
<v Speaker 5>She doesn't want to have anything to do with their,</v>

1427
00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.320
<v Speaker 5>either their advances or jokes about it.</v>

1428
00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Korean image.</v>

1429
00:42:31.271 --> 00:42:31.691
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1430
00:42:31.691 --> 00:42:32.860
<v Speaker 2>the Victorian era.</v>

1431
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:36.250
<v Speaker 2>You only had sex with your wife in order to have babies.</v>

1432
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:38.890
<v Speaker 2>You had sex to have sex with.</v>

1433
00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Court assigns with prostitutes,</v>

1434
00:42:40.781 --> 00:42:41.110
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1435
00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:41.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1436
00:42:41.501 --> 00:42:46.501
<v Speaker 2>the housemaid with whatever you didn't fuck your wife for fun or for pleasure.</v>

1437
00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:47.740
<v Speaker 2>Was that across the board.</v>

1438
00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:48.933
<v Speaker 2>Kevin agreed.</v>

1439
00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Upperclass Victorian British society across the board,</v>

1440
00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:53.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1441
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:54.400
<v Speaker 2>not on,</v>

1442
00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.500
<v Speaker 2>in France and other European societies.</v>

1443
00:42:56.501 --> 00:42:57.370
<v Speaker 2>There is a different vibe,</v>

1444
00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:59.750
<v Speaker 2>but that's the society Darwin came out.</v>

1445
00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:00.520
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1446
00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.500
<v Speaker 2>And as we tried to explain in the book,</v>

1447
00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:07.680
<v Speaker 2>that's the mentality that informs our understanding and the scientific view of</v>

1448
00:43:08.381 --> 00:43:11.830
<v Speaker 2>human sexual revolution because Darwin was an uptight guy.</v>

1449
00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:12.761
<v Speaker 2>He was great.</v>

1450
00:43:12.761 --> 00:43:13.451
<v Speaker 2>He was a genius.</v>

1451
00:43:13.451 --> 00:43:14.284
<v Speaker 2>He's a cool guy,</v>

1452
00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.140
<v Speaker 2>but he was super repressed.</v>

1453
00:43:16.141 --> 00:43:16.670
<v Speaker 2>Sexual.</v>

1454
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:18.190
<v Speaker 2>He never had sex ever.</v>

1455
00:43:18.191 --> 00:43:18.461
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1456
00:43:18.461 --> 00:43:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Isn't the only with his wife whom,</v>

1457
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:23.500
<v Speaker 2>who was his first cousin from the Wedgewood family,</v>

1458
00:43:23.501 --> 00:43:24.251
<v Speaker 2>which are the Wedgewood,</v>

1459
00:43:24.251 --> 00:43:24.930
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>

1460
00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Fortunately they still,</v>

1461
00:43:26.201 --> 00:43:28.120
<v Speaker 2>they're still making China and in England.</v>

1462
00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1463
00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.640
<v Speaker 2>and she was 30,</v>

1464
00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:32.080
<v Speaker 2>I think he was 29.</v>

1465
00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:35.320
<v Speaker 2>And his brother married with Newton.</v>

1466
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Newton was a sexual right.</v>

1467
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:39.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1468
00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.820
<v Speaker 5>Didn't have during the.</v>

1469
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.700
<v Speaker 5>Excuse me.</v>

1470
00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:42.600
<v Speaker 5>During the Victorian era,</v>

1471
00:43:42.601 --> 00:43:45.570
<v Speaker 5>didn't they cover up like legs of pianos?</v>

1472
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:46.110
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1473
00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:47.670
<v Speaker 5>And tables and chairs.</v>

1474
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:49.381
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1475
00:43:49.381 --> 00:43:50.700
<v Speaker 5>Because it would excite people.</v>

1476
00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.180
<v Speaker 5>It's so amazing.</v>

1477
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:53.400
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1478
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:53.550
<v Speaker 5>it's like</v>

1479
00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:54.181
<v Speaker 2>the Burka,</v>

1480
00:43:54.181 --> 00:43:55.160
<v Speaker 2>now you know why?</v>

1481
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:55.321
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1482
00:43:55.321 --> 00:43:56.520
<v Speaker 2>it's crazier than the Burka,</v>

1483
00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.031
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1484
00:43:57.031 --> 00:44:00.150
<v Speaker 2>what's cool about the burqa and I'm doing this,</v>

1485
00:44:00.151 --> 00:44:01.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm pitching this TV show,</v>

1486
00:44:01.321 --> 00:44:03.360
<v Speaker 2>which seems like it's going to get picked up by the way.</v>

1487
00:44:03.361 --> 00:44:03.440
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1488
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.273
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

1489
00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:04.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1490
00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:07.350
<v Speaker 2>one of the episodes is about,</v>

1491
00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.910
<v Speaker 2>is based on the story I heard from a woman who worked at Victoria's secret in</v>

1492
00:44:11.911 --> 00:44:16.911
<v Speaker 2>London and she told me that most of the lingerie they sold was to very wealthy</v>

1493
00:44:20.131 --> 00:44:25.131
<v Speaker 2>Saudi and Kuwaiti women who came in and we'd just buy out the store because they</v>

1494
00:44:25.291 --> 00:44:27.600
<v Speaker 2>were sexy lingerie under their Berkus.</v>

1495
00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:28.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1496
00:44:28.591 --> 00:44:30.250
<v Speaker 2>But it's under that stupid 10.</v>

1497
00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:33.813
<v Speaker 4>They do.</v>

1498
00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:34.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1499
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.830
<v Speaker 4>it's got to be compensating for the fact that they're forced to wear that stupid</v>

1500
00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 4>outfit.</v>

1501
00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:40.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's anything good about that outfit.</v>

1502
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:41.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1503
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:43.470
<v Speaker 4>the only thing good about it is if you're the man like,</v>

1504
00:44:43.471 --> 00:44:43.861
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1505
00:44:43.861 --> 00:44:47.850
<v Speaker 4>nobody gives a look at this says mine's going into the tent.</v>

1506
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:49.190
<v Speaker 4>It's just the what,</v>

1507
00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:49.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1508
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:50.543
<v Speaker 4>what's offensive.</v>

1509
00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:52.590
<v Speaker 4>Not the religious connection to it,</v>

1510
00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.610
<v Speaker 4>but the suppression,</v>

1511
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.230
<v Speaker 4>the idea that a woman has to wear that.</v>

1512
00:44:55.231 --> 00:44:55.620
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1513
00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.940
<v Speaker 4>It's the most depressing thing ever.</v>

1514
00:44:56.941 --> 00:44:58.890
<v Speaker 4>You're covering everything about your identity,</v>

1515
00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1516
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:03.780
<v Speaker 4>Especially it fucks up a girl if she's in a shit relationship and she's looking</v>

1517
00:45:03.781 --> 00:45:05.160
<v Speaker 4>for another dude.</v>

1518
00:45:05.161 --> 00:45:06.660
<v Speaker 4>She's looking for a little escape plan.</v>

1519
00:45:06.661 --> 00:45:07.760
<v Speaker 4>You know that guy has no.</v>

1520
00:45:07.761 --> 00:45:11.790
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is getting into dress getting abused and nobody can see her.</v>

1521
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:13.530
<v Speaker 4>Her bruise marks.</v>

1522
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.431
<v Speaker 4>That's another way that.</v>

1523
00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:14.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1524
00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:15.570
<v Speaker 4>That's another point.</v>

1525
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:16.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1526
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:16.351
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

1527
00:45:16.351 --> 00:45:17.131
<v Speaker 4>I jumped off.</v>

1528
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:17.964
<v Speaker 4>What were we talking about?</v>

1529
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:18.953
<v Speaker 4>That</v>

1530
00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.110
<v Speaker 4>shit before.</v>

1531
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:25.831
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man,</v>

1532
00:45:25.831 --> 00:45:26.621
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even stone.</v>

1533
00:45:26.621 --> 00:45:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1534
00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:26.991
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1535
00:45:26.991 --> 00:45:31.700
<v Speaker 4>we were just talking about the suppression of sexuality that women don't feel</v>

1536
00:45:31.701 --> 00:45:32.534
<v Speaker 4>like a</v>

1537
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Koreans in Darwin and all that.</v>

1538
00:45:34.651 --> 00:45:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1539
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:35.873
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1540
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:36.331
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1541
00:45:36.331 --> 00:45:36.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1542
00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.400
<v Speaker 2>when we originally pitched this book,</v>

1543
00:45:38.401 --> 00:45:43.350
<v Speaker 2>it was called what Darwin didn't know about sex and the idea was to write a</v>

1544
00:45:43.351 --> 00:45:48.351
<v Speaker 2>biography of Darwin sex life and then tie that into our modern misconceptions of</v>

1545
00:45:49.111 --> 00:45:52.020
<v Speaker 2>sexuality because he went and he had lots of opportunity,</v>

1546
00:45:52.021 --> 00:45:52.321
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1547
00:45:52.321 --> 00:45:54.840
<v Speaker 2>He went on the Beagle all down around South America,</v>

1548
00:45:54.841 --> 00:45:56.310
<v Speaker 2>across the South Pacific.</v>

1549
00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.740
<v Speaker 2>They stopped in Tahiti,</v>

1550
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:59.310
<v Speaker 2>which is sexual paradise,</v>

1551
00:45:59.311 --> 00:46:00.810
<v Speaker 2>especially in the 19th century.</v>

1552
00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:01.260
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1553
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:02.340
<v Speaker 2>it was sexual paradise.</v>

1554
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.310
<v Speaker 2>That's why the mutiny on the bounty happened because the,</v>

1555
00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.163
<v Speaker 2>the bounty.</v>

1556
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:07.921
<v Speaker 2>You've seen the movie,</v>

1557
00:46:07.921 --> 00:46:08.161
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1558
00:46:08.161 --> 00:46:09.030
<v Speaker 2>The Marlin Brando.</v>

1559
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:10.290
<v Speaker 2>I never saw that movie.</v>

1560
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:10.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1561
00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:11.493
<v Speaker 2>it's this,</v>

1562
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.061
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1563
00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:12.461
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

1564
00:46:12.461 --> 00:46:12.930
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1565
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:15.600
<v Speaker 2>the bounty I guess was captain,</v>

1566
00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what his name was,</v>

1567
00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:19.110
<v Speaker 2>captain something flusher or something like that.</v>

1568
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.861
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1569
00:46:19.861 --> 00:46:20.700
<v Speaker 2>it was a British,</v>

1570
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.470
<v Speaker 2>a whaling ship I think,</v>

1571
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.180
<v Speaker 2>or mapping ship maybe.</v>

1572
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.841
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1573
00:46:24.841 --> 00:46:28.740
<v Speaker 2>it stopped in Tahiti to spend about a month or two months there to like,</v>

1574
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:29.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1575
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:31.950
<v Speaker 2>get fresh water and fix the ship and do all this stuff.</v>

1576
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile the dudes went down and they were on the island and there's a very</v>

1577
00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:40.401
<v Speaker 2>relaxed sexual situation into hedy and in many parts of the world.</v>

1578
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:46.170
<v Speaker 2>And so these repressed British sailors who hadn't seen a woman and God knows how</v>

1579
00:46:46.171 --> 00:46:46.800
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

1580
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly there are all these beautiful women around who were happy to have sex</v>

1581
00:46:50.311 --> 00:46:51.810
<v Speaker 2>with them just for fun.</v>

1582
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:53.213
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1583
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.440
<v Speaker 2>so these guys are getting laid left and right.</v>

1584
00:46:55.441 --> 00:46:56.101
<v Speaker 2>And then the,</v>

1585
00:46:56.101 --> 00:46:57.660
<v Speaker 2>the bad ass captain says,</v>

1586
00:46:57.661 --> 00:46:57.871
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1587
00:46:57.871 --> 00:46:58.980
<v Speaker 2>everybody back on the ship,</v>

1588
00:46:58.981 --> 00:47:00.060
<v Speaker 2>we're going back to see.</v>

1589
00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.850
<v Speaker 2>They get about four hours out to sea.</v>

1590
00:47:02.851 --> 00:47:05.790
<v Speaker 2>And there's a mutiny because the dudes are like,</v>

1591
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:06.900
<v Speaker 2>fuck this,</v>

1592
00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.640
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go back to England.</v>

1593
00:47:08.641 --> 00:47:10.140
<v Speaker 2>We're going back to the hedy men.</v>

1594
00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:11.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's what they did.</v>

1595
00:47:11.371 --> 00:47:16.371
<v Speaker 2>So this is this famous case because there was like lots of Nice Pussy.</v>

1596
00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.670
<v Speaker 4>You mean Nice women on your say pussy,</v>

1597
00:47:21.671 --> 00:47:21.891
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1598
00:47:21.891 --> 00:47:22.150
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1599
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:23.840
<v Speaker 4>you're objectifying women.</v>

1600
00:47:23.841 --> 00:47:25.700
<v Speaker 4>You're breaking them down to one body part.</v>

1601
00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:27.530
<v Speaker 4>I know what year,</v>

1602
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:27.920
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1603
00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:28.753
<v Speaker 4>that's even worse.</v>

1604
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:29.170
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1605
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 4>your intentions are pure.</v>

1606
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:32.500
<v Speaker 6>But for our women friends out there,</v>

1607
00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:34.230
<v Speaker 6>that would be the white knight take on it.</v>

1608
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.313
<v Speaker 6>Well done.</v>

1609
00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:36.363
<v Speaker 6>Calling them,</v>

1610
00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:38.620
<v Speaker 6>calling them by their sexual organs.</v>

1611
00:47:38.621 --> 00:47:39.610
<v Speaker 6>It's really not cool,</v>

1612
00:47:39.611 --> 00:47:40.444
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1613
00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.680
<v Speaker 6>Well last night I was at a party and a woman said something,</v>

1614
00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.190
<v Speaker 6>said some guy was a real dick.</v>

1615
00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.980
<v Speaker 6>And I and everyone laughed.</v>

1616
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:47.291
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

1617
00:47:47.291 --> 00:47:47.780
<v Speaker 6>that's funny.</v>

1618
00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:51.100
<v Speaker 6>If someone was a country I'd would be sort of nasty.</v>

1619
00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:51.934
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1620
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:55.870
<v Speaker 6>So we got into this whole conversation about how come one body parts offensive</v>

1621
00:47:55.871 --> 00:47:59.850
<v Speaker 6>and the other isn't well is like if she called him a coc,</v>

1622
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:01.650
<v Speaker 6>that guy's a cock.</v>

1623
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:04.020
<v Speaker 6>That still,</v>

1624
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.910
<v Speaker 6>depending on how the guy felt about the girl,</v>

1625
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:07.601
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1626
00:48:07.601 --> 00:48:09.880
<v Speaker 6>if he thought she thought he was the shit,</v>

1627
00:48:09.881 --> 00:48:10.714
<v Speaker 6>that would be a problem,</v>

1628
00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:11.733
<v Speaker 6>that'd be devastating.</v>

1629
00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:15.910
<v Speaker 6>I was a couple of weeks ago I gave a Ted talk or talking about this corporate</v>

1630
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:17.800
<v Speaker 6>environment and um,</v>

1631
00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:18.460

00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:22.270
<v Speaker 6>You're the guy who was there.</v>

1635
00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:22.810
<v Speaker 6>Anyone.</v>

1636

00:48:23.621 --> 00:48:24.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1639
00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:24.851

00:48:24.851 --> 00:48:25.780
<v Speaker 6>who also has had issues.</v>

1641
00:48:25.781 --> 00:48:29.460
<v Speaker 6>Graham Hancock's had a very interesting situation and shelter.</v>

1642
00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:32.680
<v Speaker 6>Rupert sheldrake is good friends with Stanley Kripner.</v>

1645
00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:35.613
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1647
00:48:37.061 --> 00:48:37.894
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1648
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:39.760
<v Speaker 6>But all those old hippie stick together.</v>

<v Speaker 6>freaky guys.</v>

1653
00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:44.230
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1654
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.951
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>

1655
00:48:44.951 --> 00:48:45.341
<v Speaker 6>anyway,</v>

1656
00:48:45.341 --> 00:48:48.490
<v Speaker 6>so I've got this presentation and when I did the rehearsal,</v>

1657
00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:53.710
<v Speaker 6>one of the slides and the presentation that I've used all over and know colleges</v>

1658
00:48:53.711 --> 00:48:54.544
<v Speaker 6>all over and stuff,</v>

1659
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:55.421
<v Speaker 6>it's got.</v>

1660
00:48:55.421 --> 00:48:59.650
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about testicular ratio and how that explained certain things about</v>

1661
00:48:59.651 --> 00:49:00.484
<v Speaker 6>our ancestors.</v>

1662
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.290
<v Speaker 6>So I've got in one corner,</v>

1663
00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:05.920
<v Speaker 6>there's a gorilla lying on his back and the sun and there's like nothing.</v>

1664
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:07.360
<v Speaker 6>He's got no balls at all.</v>

1665
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:09.160
<v Speaker 6>They're like the size of kidney beans.</v>

1666
00:49:09.161 --> 00:49:10.210
<v Speaker 6>They're inside his abdomen,</v>

1667
00:49:10.211 --> 00:49:11.110
<v Speaker 6>so you don't see anything.</v>

1668
00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:12.640
<v Speaker 6>On the other corner,</v>

1669
00:49:12.641 --> 00:49:15.910
<v Speaker 6>there's a Banaba who's got balls the size of chicken eggs,</v>

1670
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.540
<v Speaker 6>and in the middle there's a picture of this buddy of mine in a,</v>

1671
00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:24.340
<v Speaker 6>in a speedo sitting on a hammock and he's got pretty big balls and so the law,</v>

1672
00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.660
<v Speaker 6>it says like gorilla,</v>

1673
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:28.510
<v Speaker 6>but Nobo and over my friend it says Italian.</v>

1674
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:29.840
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1675
00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.760
<v Speaker 6>That always gets a huge laugh when I do that.</v>

1676
00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:34.150
<v Speaker 6>I did this at Ted and they were like,</v>

1677
00:49:34.151 --> 00:49:34.481
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1678
00:49:34.481 --> 00:49:34.811
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1679
00:49:34.811 --> 00:49:35.980
<v Speaker 6>after the rehearsal they're like,</v>

1680
00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:36.161
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1681
00:49:36.161 --> 00:49:36.971
<v Speaker 6>that was really good.</v>

1682
00:49:36.971 --> 00:49:37.391
<v Speaker 6>That's great.</v>

1683
00:49:37.391 --> 00:49:38.590
<v Speaker 6>Except that one.</v>

1684
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:40.503
<v Speaker 6>And they.</v>

1685
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:42.730
<v Speaker 6>They thought Italians would be offended.</v>

1686
00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:43.861
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

1687
00:49:43.861 --> 00:49:44.381
<v Speaker 6>I'm always saying,</v>

1688
00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:45.310
<v Speaker 6>you tell that Italian,</v>

1689
00:49:45.311 --> 00:49:46.210
<v Speaker 6>he's got big balls.</v>

1690
00:49:46.211 --> 00:49:47.500
<v Speaker 6>That's a compliment.</v>

1691
00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.320
<v Speaker 6>Little do they know they have big balls because the Italian women are so</v>

1692
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.353
<v Speaker 6>permissible.</v>

1693
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.101
<v Speaker 6>Read the book.</v>

1694
00:49:54.101 --> 00:49:54.934
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1695
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:55.803
<v Speaker 6>Devastating.</v>

1696
00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:58.000
<v Speaker 6>Devastating to the Italian mentality.</v>

1697
00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:00.060
<v Speaker 6>I can't believe it.</v>

1698
00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.990
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that's the part that's insulting.</v>

1699
00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:06.820
<v Speaker 6>The size of your package is directly proportionate to how slutty girls around</v>

1700
00:50:06.821 --> 00:50:07.654
<v Speaker 6>you are.</v>

1701
00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:12.910
<v Speaker 6>I shouldn't say slutty and that was a another fascinating aspect of your book</v>

1702
00:50:12.911 --> 00:50:15.700
<v Speaker 6>that I learned the origins of the word promiscuous,</v>

1703
00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:18.640
<v Speaker 6>that everybody was sort of assumes that promiscuity,</v>

1704
00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.410
<v Speaker 6>when United State Girls Promiscuous,</v>

1705
00:50:20.411 --> 00:50:23.950
<v Speaker 6>that she just sleeps with strangers and runs around.</v>

1706
00:50:23.951 --> 00:50:24.850
<v Speaker 6>She's got loose morals.</v>

1707
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.830
<v Speaker 6>That's not the root of the word.</v>

1708
00:50:26.831 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 6>The root of the word is mixed,</v>

1709
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.650
<v Speaker 5>meaning she has sex with more than one person.</v>

1710
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.820
<v Speaker 5>She has relations with more than one person.</v>

1711
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:33.950
<v Speaker 5>Generally speaking,</v>

1712
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:38.840
<v Speaker 5>probably knew those people her entire life because the real origins of these</v>

1713
00:50:38.841 --> 00:50:41.000
<v Speaker 5>sort of orgiastic tribal societies of that,</v>

1714
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:42.620
<v Speaker 5>there's only 50 of them.</v>

1715
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:45.860
<v Speaker 5>They were living together in the woods and they knew each other from the time</v>

1716
00:50:45.861 --> 00:50:48.800
<v Speaker 5>they were born and they had sex with each other and they had sexual</v>

1717
00:50:48.801 --> 00:50:50.720
<v Speaker 5>relationships with more than one person.</v>

1718
00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:52.910
<v Speaker 5>And our ideas of,</v>

1719
00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:53.390
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1720
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:54.051
<v Speaker 5>monogamy,</v>

1721
00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:54.830
<v Speaker 5>monogamy,</v>

1722
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:57.680
<v Speaker 5>it's great if it works for you.</v>

1723
00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:02.770
<v Speaker 5>If it works for you in 2013 and the corporate world and the legal world is</v>

1724
00:51:03.291 --> 00:51:03.710
<v Speaker 5>great,</v>

1725
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:08.420
<v Speaker 5>but if you look at 50 people living alone in the woods,</v>

1726
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:09.770
<v Speaker 5>staying bonded together,</v>

1727
00:51:09.771 --> 00:51:13.010
<v Speaker 5>the best way for everybody to truly love each other as everybody fucks</v>

1728
00:51:13.011 --> 00:51:13.790
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>

1729
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:14.400
<v Speaker 5>I mean you,</v>

1730
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.550
<v Speaker 5>you really are like monkey people.</v>

1731
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.511
<v Speaker 5>I mean your,</v>

1732
00:51:17.511 --> 00:51:21.950
<v Speaker 5>your monkey people with more advanced genetics and more advanced tools and shit,</v>

1733
00:51:21.951 --> 00:51:26.060
<v Speaker 5>but you're essentially living not much different than you know,</v>

1734
00:51:26.061 --> 00:51:27.800
<v Speaker 5>than an animal with tools.</v>

1735
00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:28.620
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1736
00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:29.700
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1737
00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.970
<v Speaker 5>that's how people at the dawn of time lived.</v>

1738
00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:33.680
<v Speaker 5>Those people,</v>

1739
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.660
<v Speaker 5>it would benefit them to be sexually engaged.</v>

1740
00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:36.950
<v Speaker 5>Each.</v>

1741
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.200
<v Speaker 5>It would benefit them to be polyamorous.</v>

1742
00:51:39.201 --> 00:51:42.560
<v Speaker 5>It would benefit them to have love spread out,</v>

1743
00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:42.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1744
00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.191
<v Speaker 5>deep,</v>

1745
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:45.740
<v Speaker 5>intense love with bunch of tribal members.</v>

1746
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1747
00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1748
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1749
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:47.640
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1750
00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.361
<v Speaker 2>no question.</v>

1751
00:51:48.361 --> 00:51:49.194
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1752
00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:50.220
<v Speaker 2>when I was,</v>

1753
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:51.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1754
00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:51.310
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1755
00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:55.650
<v Speaker 2>I'd done all this research on tribal people and they're really interesting</v>

1756
00:51:55.950 --> 00:52:00.950
<v Speaker 2>rituals that are seem designed to make sure that people don't break down into</v>

1757
00:52:03.631 --> 00:52:04.740
<v Speaker 2>nuclear families,</v>

1758
00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:05.071
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1759
00:52:05.071 --> 00:52:05.260
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1760
00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:10.260
<v Speaker 2>they're designed to make sure even though you and this woman really like being</v>

1761
00:52:10.801 --> 00:52:11.571
<v Speaker 2>together and,</v>

1762
00:52:11.571 --> 00:52:14.880
<v Speaker 2>and you know your hammocks are next to each other and you spend most of your</v>

1763
00:52:14.881 --> 00:52:15.714
<v Speaker 2>time together.</v>

1764
00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:16.981
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1765
00:52:16.981 --> 00:52:20.400
<v Speaker 2>And we're not saying that there was no pair bonding right in prehistory,</v>

1766
00:52:20.401 --> 00:52:25.320
<v Speaker 2>but all these cultures seem to have these rituals to make sure that you and your</v>

1767
00:52:25.321 --> 00:52:27.180
<v Speaker 2>woman both have sex with other people,</v>

1768
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.561
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1769
00:52:28.561 --> 00:52:33.390
<v Speaker 2>So like they're tattooing ceremonies where everybody has sex and it's prohibited</v>

1770
00:52:33.391 --> 00:52:35.040
<v Speaker 2>to have sex with your normal partner.</v>

1771
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1772
00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Or there what Wacky fucking cultures.</v>

1773
00:52:38.271 --> 00:52:39.480
<v Speaker 1>If it's in the Amazon,</v>

1774
00:52:39.481 --> 00:52:41.160
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of the men in the South Pacific.</v>

1775
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:42.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens when you don't have the Internet.</v>

1776
00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Start getting crazy</v>

1777
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:49.120
<v Speaker 1>sets one assholes idea email.</v>

1778
00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:49.861
<v Speaker 1>It's one guy,</v>

1779
00:52:49.861 --> 00:52:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Richard,</v>

1780
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:51.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fuck your wife.</v>

1781
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.860
<v Speaker 1>You're going to fuck my wife.</v>

1782
00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I want to fuck your wife.</v>

1783
00:52:54.001 --> 00:52:54.834
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1784
00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:56.990
<v Speaker 1>let me make it a law.</v>

1785
00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.000
<v Speaker 1>A law firm.</v>

1786
00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:01.320
<v Speaker 1>You have to make it a law that's fucking silly that,</v>

1787
00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're social engineering is no better than ours or theirs.</v>

1788
00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:05.910
<v Speaker 1>They'll do what you want to do.</v>

1789
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:06.840
<v Speaker 1>This other societies,</v>

1790
00:53:06.841 --> 00:53:07.620
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

1791
00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:08.453
<v Speaker 2>Kulina,</v>

1792
00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:09.433
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1793
00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:13.770
<v Speaker 2>Paula Don pollock was the anthropologist who lived with them for 20 years.</v>

1794
00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:16.380
<v Speaker 2>He talks about this ritual,</v>

1795
00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:17.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to pronounce it,</v>

1796
00:53:17.941 --> 00:53:18.501
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1797
00:53:18.501 --> 00:53:18.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1798
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:23.800
<v Speaker 2>the translates to the order to get meat and the women will wake up in the and</v>

1799
00:53:25.531 --> 00:53:25.671
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1800
00:53:25.671 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1801
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:27.240
<v Speaker 2>they get together and they say,</v>

1802
00:53:27.241 --> 00:53:27.451
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1803
00:53:27.451 --> 00:53:28.440
<v Speaker 2>let's do this thing today.</v>

1804
00:53:28.441 --> 00:53:32.670
<v Speaker 2>So they all start singing and they'll go around the village singing the song</v>

1805
00:53:32.671 --> 00:53:35.520
<v Speaker 2>that translates to you guys are lazy.</v>

1806
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.930
<v Speaker 2>We don't get enough meat,</v>

1807
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.400
<v Speaker 2>when are you going to give us some meat?</v>

1808
00:53:38.401 --> 00:53:38.941
<v Speaker 2>We want me,</v>

1809
00:53:38.941 --> 00:53:39.121
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1810
00:53:39.121 --> 00:53:40.290
<v Speaker 2>So they're singing this and it's.</v>

1811
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:41.430
<v Speaker 2>And I asked him,</v>

1812
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:43.610
<v Speaker 2>does meet to have a double meaning it?</v>

1813
00:53:43.611 --> 00:53:44.041
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1814
00:53:44.041 --> 00:53:44.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1815
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:44.911
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

1816
00:53:44.911 --> 00:53:48.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like same as go hunting but also give us some Dick,</v>

1817
00:53:48.451 --> 00:53:48.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1818
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.730
<v Speaker 2>So while they're singing the song,</v>

1819
00:53:50.731 --> 00:53:55.080
<v Speaker 2>they go around and the women will beat on the post that's holding the guys</v>

1820
00:53:55.081 --> 00:53:55.914
<v Speaker 2>hammock.</v>

1821
00:53:56.490 --> 00:54:00.000
<v Speaker 2>And that means if you go hunting today and you bring back some meat,</v>

1822
00:54:00.001 --> 00:54:01.020
<v Speaker 2>I'll sleep with you tonight.</v>

1823
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:05.370
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a motivation to get out of your hammock and go hunting,</v>

1824
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.640
<v Speaker 2>but you can't hit the post of your normal partner.</v>

1825
00:54:08.641 --> 00:54:09.870
<v Speaker 2>It has to be someone else.</v>

1826
00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:11.093
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1827
00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:14.070
<v Speaker 2>So then the men can,</v>

1828
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:14.731
<v Speaker 2>if they don't,</v>

1829
00:54:14.731 --> 00:54:14.941
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1830
00:54:14.941 --> 00:54:17.700
<v Speaker 2>if you don't want to have sex with a woman who hit your post,</v>

1831
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:18.481
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>

1832
00:54:18.481 --> 00:54:20.370
<v Speaker 2>oh my stomach today,</v>

1833
00:54:20.371 --> 00:54:20.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1834
00:54:20.731 --> 00:54:22.770
<v Speaker 2>whenever I'm not feeling well you don't have to do it.</v>

1835
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.371
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

1836
00:54:23.371 --> 00:54:24.480
<v Speaker 2>So the guys who get up,</v>

1837
00:54:24.481 --> 00:54:25.860
<v Speaker 2>they'll like get up and be all,</v>

1838
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:26.550
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1839
00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:27.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1840
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:30.840
<v Speaker 2>grumbly and pissed off and then they'll go leave the village together.</v>

1841
00:54:30.841 --> 00:54:32.850
<v Speaker 2>But this area they hunt mostly monkeys.</v>

1842
00:54:32.851 --> 00:54:34.350
<v Speaker 2>And so they hunt independently,</v>

1843
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:34.741
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1844
00:54:34.741 --> 00:54:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Because the monkeys are spread out.</v>

1845
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:36.781
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1846
00:54:36.781 --> 00:54:38.970
<v Speaker 2>But before they split up to go hunting,</v>

1847
00:54:38.971 --> 00:54:42.750
<v Speaker 2>they'll agree to meet at this certain point before they go into the village.</v>

1848
00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.250
<v Speaker 2>So the uh,</v>

1849
00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:45.310
<v Speaker 2>or the camp or whatever.</v>

1850
00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:46.380
<v Speaker 2>So they'll go out,</v>

1851
00:54:46.381 --> 00:54:47.520
<v Speaker 2>some of them will get a monkey,</v>

1852
00:54:47.521 --> 00:54:51.300
<v Speaker 2>someone they meet back at this place and they cut up the monkey so that</v>

1853
00:54:51.301 --> 00:54:53.940
<v Speaker 2>everybody has a piece of meat going back into the village.</v>

1854
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:55.380
<v Speaker 2>So everybody gets laid,</v>

1855
00:54:55.381 --> 00:54:56.214
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1856
00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.410
<v Speaker 2>So it's like pretty clearly,</v>

1857
00:54:58.411 --> 00:55:02.610
<v Speaker 2>this is all about mixing it up and it's not just for fun because there's nothing</v>

1858
00:55:02.611 --> 00:55:03.444
<v Speaker 2>else to do.</v>

1859
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:05.220
<v Speaker 2>It's also to,</v>

1860
00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:05.880
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1861
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:06.713
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1862
00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:09.300
<v Speaker 2>to mitigate the risk of conflict,</v>

1863
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:10.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1864
00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Because if you get possessive about other people and their sexuality,</v>

1865
00:55:13.711 --> 00:55:17.640
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have lots of conflicts and conflict among this small shows.</v>

1866
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:18.271
<v Speaker 2>Social Group,</v>

1867
00:55:18.271 --> 00:55:18.691
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>

1868
00:55:18.691 --> 00:55:21.030
<v Speaker 2>it's 50 to 150 maximum,</v>

1869
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:21.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1870
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Because of Dunbar's number,</v>

1871
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.620
<v Speaker 2>which we can get into if you want.</v>

1872
00:55:25.621 --> 00:55:30.030
<v Speaker 2>But we can be pretty sure that the groups were never more than 150 individuals.</v>

1873
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:34.470
<v Speaker 2>So the worst thing that can happen is you get schisms within that group because</v>

1874
00:55:34.471 --> 00:55:36.060
<v Speaker 2>you're all depending on each other.</v>

1875
00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:36.511
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1876
00:55:36.511 --> 00:55:38.340
<v Speaker 2>some people are better hunters than others.</v>

1877
00:55:38.341 --> 00:55:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Some people are better at cooking or making bows and arrows,</v>

1878
00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:42.480
<v Speaker 2>sheds and all this kind of stuff.</v>

1879
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:44.670
<v Speaker 2>Is that the origin of Dunbar's number?</v>

1880
00:55:44.671 --> 00:55:48.990
<v Speaker 2>Is that why we only have room in our head for supposedly 150 close</v>

1881
00:55:48.991 --> 00:55:49.824
<v Speaker 2>relationships?</v>

1882
00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1883
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Dunbar's is a biologist that either Cambridge or Oxford,</v>

1884
00:55:54.241 --> 00:55:55.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember which,</v>

1885
00:55:55.081 --> 00:55:56.430
<v Speaker 2>but he was looking at um,</v>

1886
00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:57.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1887
00:55:57.900 --> 00:55:58.180
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1888
00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:03.180
<v Speaker 2>the brain size of different primates and he found that he could predict the</v>

1889
00:56:03.631 --> 00:56:04.201
<v Speaker 2>social,</v>

1890
00:56:04.201 --> 00:56:05.370
<v Speaker 2>the group of the social,</v>

1891
00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:05.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1892
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:09.450
<v Speaker 2>size of the social group of any primate by looking at its neocortex.</v>

1893
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:13.230
<v Speaker 2>And so when he looked at humans and made that calculation,</v>

1894
00:56:13.231 --> 00:56:13.501
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1895
00:56:13.501 --> 00:56:13.741
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1896
00:56:13.741 --> 00:56:15.360
<v Speaker 2>it should be about 150.</v>

1897
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:18.030
<v Speaker 2>And then they looked at the anthropological record and they found,</v>

1898
00:56:18.031 --> 00:56:18.211
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1899
00:56:18.211 --> 00:56:18.691
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

1900
00:56:18.691 --> 00:56:21.330
<v Speaker 2>When these social groups grew to more than 150,</v>

1901
00:56:21.331 --> 00:56:21.930
<v Speaker 2>they split.</v>

1902
00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:23.830
<v Speaker 2>They tend to split into other groups,</v>

1903
00:56:23.831 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 2>not</v>

1904
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:26.000
<v Speaker 6>acrimoniously just because</v>

1905
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.780
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1906
00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.590
<v Speaker 4>So we've sort of developed a,</v>

1907
00:56:28.591 --> 00:56:31.220
<v Speaker 4>a need for a certain amount of space.</v>

1908
00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:31.790
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1909
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:32.121
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1910
00:56:32.121 --> 00:56:34.850
<v Speaker 4>it's like that's as many people as we can keep track of.</v>

1911
00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:39.650
<v Speaker 4>And because we didn't encounter large groups that was adequate for the time and</v>

1912
00:56:39.651 --> 00:56:44.651
<v Speaker 4>it takes a long fucking time for the human genetics to adjust to their new</v>

1913
00:56:44.721 --> 00:56:45.554
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>

1914
00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:46.730
<v Speaker 4>which is very odd.</v>

1915
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:49.970
<v Speaker 4>But it made sense for a million years,</v>

1916
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:50.691
<v Speaker 4>for a million years.</v>

1917
00:56:50.691 --> 00:56:53.750
<v Speaker 4>It totally made sense until the last few hundred and then things just have</v>

1918
00:56:53.751 --> 00:56:58.751
<v Speaker 4>gotten so strange that the human genetics are essentially the same as those</v>

1919
00:56:59.031 --> 00:57:00.560
<v Speaker 4>people that are living in the Amazon.</v>

1920
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.581
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1921
00:57:01.581 --> 00:57:01.821
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1922
00:57:01.821 --> 00:57:03.380
<v Speaker 4>there have been some changes.</v>

1923
00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:07.350
<v Speaker 4>There's a great book called the 10,000 year explosion that talks about the,</v>

1924
00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:10.310
<v Speaker 4>the genetic changes that have happened since agriculture.</v>

1925
00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:11.870
<v Speaker 4>What are they like the most significant ones?</v>

1926
00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:12.150
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1927
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.890
<v Speaker 4>eye color,</v>

1928
00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:13.730
<v Speaker 4>skin color,</v>

1929
00:57:13.731 --> 00:57:14.564
<v Speaker 4>hair color,</v>

1930
00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:14.811
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1931
00:57:14.811 --> 00:57:15.140
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1932
00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:18.020
<v Speaker 4>there were no blue eyed people 10,000 years ago.</v>

1933
00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:20.180
<v Speaker 4>They know that DNA.</v>

1934
00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:21.590
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1935
00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:21.861
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1936
00:57:21.861 --> 00:57:23.420
<v Speaker 4>They've got like 10,000 year old people.</v>

1937
00:57:23.421 --> 00:57:23.901
<v Speaker 4>DNA.</v>

1938
00:57:23.901 --> 00:57:25.360
<v Speaker 4>Like that old dude that fell on the,</v>

1939
00:57:25.361 --> 00:57:25.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1940
00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:28.560
<v Speaker 4>the ice man selling the a glacier.</v>

1941
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:30.200
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1942
00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.400
<v Speaker 4>if you haven't heard of that story,</v>

1943
00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.390
<v Speaker 4>believably amazing story because it's such a rare fine.</v>

1944
00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:40.600
<v Speaker 4>This guy died and he fell in a crevasse and the glacier went over him and didn't</v>

1945
00:57:40.671 --> 00:57:41.504
<v Speaker 4>wipe them out.</v>

1946
00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.070
<v Speaker 4>And that's really rare.</v>

1947
00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:44.090
<v Speaker 4>Most things,</v>

1948
00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:47.720
<v Speaker 4>glaciers were like a mile high plus sometimes.</v>

1949
00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:51.050
<v Speaker 4>And as they moved across Europe and across North America,</v>

1950
00:57:51.051 --> 00:57:52.610
<v Speaker 4>across everywhere on the world.</v>

1951
00:57:52.611 --> 00:57:53.900
<v Speaker 4>And at one point in time there's glaciers,</v>

1952
00:57:53.901 --> 00:57:54.734
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1953
00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:55.603
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1954
00:57:55.850 --> 00:57:56.930
<v Speaker 4>equatorial region,</v>

1955
00:57:56.970 --> 00:57:57.711
<v Speaker 4>70 equator,</v>

1956
00:57:57.711 --> 00:57:58.160
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1957
00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:58.511
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1958
00:57:58.511 --> 00:57:58.790
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1959
00:57:58.790 --> 00:58:03.790
<v Speaker 4>what they would do is just completely erase everything that's in front of them.</v>

1960
00:58:03.871 --> 00:58:04.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1961
00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:05.270
<v Speaker 4>Because houses,</v>

1962
00:58:05.271 --> 00:58:09.000
<v Speaker 4>trees just crush everything rivers</v>

1963
00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:11.390
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>

1964
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:16.280
<v Speaker 4>So anything that died back then that got crushed by this slow moving glacier.</v>

1965
00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:17.360
<v Speaker 4>We have nothing.</v>

1966
00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:18.890
<v Speaker 4>We have no evidence of it.</v>

1967
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:19.440
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1968
00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.070
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1969
00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:23.140
<v Speaker 6>I've got a book idea that relates to this.</v>

1970
00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:24.850
<v Speaker 6>That's a really good point.</v>

1971
00:58:24.851 --> 00:58:26.830
<v Speaker 6>I hadn't thought about the glaciers are racing,</v>

1972
00:58:26.831 --> 00:58:27.664
<v Speaker 6>stuff like that.</v>

1973
00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:29.740
<v Speaker 6>What I thought the book idea is,</v>

1974
00:58:29.741 --> 00:58:33.910
<v Speaker 6>you don't remember how Rumsfeld going into a rack said they're the known knowns</v>

1975
00:58:33.911 --> 00:58:35.610
<v Speaker 6>and the known unknowns and the unknown.</v>

1976
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:36.130
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1977
00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:36.941
<v Speaker 6>remember that whole thing.</v>

1978
00:58:36.941 --> 00:58:41.140
<v Speaker 6>He's don't remember that he gave his press conference and somebody was talking</v>

1979
00:58:41.141 --> 00:58:45.310
<v Speaker 6>about predicting what was gonna happen and he said they're the known knowns,</v>

1980
00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:50.350
<v Speaker 6>the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns.</v>

1981
00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:51.460
<v Speaker 6>So the things you know,</v>

1982
00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:52.120
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1983
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:52.691
<v Speaker 6>things you know,</v>

1984
00:58:52.691 --> 00:58:56.440
<v Speaker 6>you don't know and the things you don't know that you don't know what.</v>

1985
00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:59.920
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of an interesting of shitty idea to go to war with that.</v>

1986
00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:01.143
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

1987
00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:05.710
<v Speaker 6>So what I was thinking is write a book about the known unknowns,</v>

1988
00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:08.560
<v Speaker 6>the things we know we don't know,</v>

1989
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:10.540
<v Speaker 6>but that we ignore.</v>

1990
00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:12.010
<v Speaker 6>Like for example,</v>

1991
00:59:12.011 --> 00:59:13.270
<v Speaker 6>in anther anthropology,</v>

1992
00:59:13.271 --> 00:59:14.290
<v Speaker 6>archeology,</v>

1993
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:18.040
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about the glaciers wiping out whatever it was there,</v>

1994
00:59:18.041 --> 00:59:19.740
<v Speaker 6>which is absolutely the teenagers.</v>

1995
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:20.501
<v Speaker 6>Why about houses?</v>

1996
00:59:20.501 --> 00:59:21.860
<v Speaker 6>They would wipe the valley,</v>

1997
00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.090
<v Speaker 6>you</v>

1998
00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:22.740
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1999
00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.250
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>

2000
00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:24.083
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2001
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.720
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2002
00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:25.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2003
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:26.300
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty complete,</v>

2004
00:59:26.301 --> 00:59:27.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2005
00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:28.040
<v Speaker 2>but the other was like,</v>

2006
00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:28.950
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

2007
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:29.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2008
00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.160
<v Speaker 2>people left Africa.</v>

2009
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:32.211
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2010
00:59:32.211 --> 00:59:36.670
<v Speaker 2>the current understanding is about 70,000 years ago and spread out around our</v>

2011
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:37.910
<v Speaker 2>40,000 years ago.</v>

2012
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Seventy thousand years ago is the Toba eruption,</v>

2013
00:59:40.131 --> 00:59:42.080
<v Speaker 2>which almost wiped out our species.</v>

2014
00:59:42.081 --> 00:59:47.081
<v Speaker 2>There were genetic tests show that there were about 3000 couples,</v>

2015
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:51.050
<v Speaker 2>a reproducing couples that have the genetic line has continued.</v>

2016
00:59:51.051 --> 00:59:56.051
<v Speaker 2>So there was this huge bottleneck because the lake Toba is now Lake Toba in</v>

2017
00:59:56.691 --> 01:00:01.691
<v Speaker 2>Sumatra was this eruption that triggered an immediate ice age and like the feet</v>

2018
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:07.240
<v Speaker 2>of ash all over Asia and just killed everything and triggered winter it was</v>

2019
01:00:07.311 --> 01:00:08.144
<v Speaker 2>really nasty.</v>

2020
01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:08.931
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

2021
01:00:08.931 --> 01:00:09.380
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2022
01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.940
<v Speaker 2>about 40,000 years ago,</v>

2023
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:12.860
<v Speaker 2>our ancestors left Africa,</v>

2024
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:14.120
<v Speaker 2>the out of Africa,</v>

2025
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.073
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2026
01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:18.080
<v Speaker 2>event and they spread out around the world,</v>

2027
01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:19.790
<v Speaker 2>but they mostly follow the coastline,</v>

2028
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:20.211
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2029
01:00:20.211 --> 01:00:20.931
<v Speaker 2>Which you would,</v>

2030
01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:21.111
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2031
01:00:21.111 --> 01:00:25.070
<v Speaker 2>because that's where like foods washing up and there's shellfish in there and</v>

2032
01:00:25.071 --> 01:00:26.330
<v Speaker 2>you've got good sight lines.</v>

2033
01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:28.130
<v Speaker 2>So those bears and leopards and shit,</v>

2034
01:00:28.131 --> 01:00:28.970
<v Speaker 2>you'll see them come in,</v>

2035
01:00:28.971 --> 01:00:29.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2036
01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.250
<v Speaker 2>You can run into the water to get away from him.</v>

2037
01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:32.090
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2038
01:00:32.091 --> 01:00:32.271
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2039
01:00:32.271 --> 01:00:32.931
<v Speaker 2>the sort of,</v>

2040
01:00:32.931 --> 01:00:33.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2041
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:35.030
<v Speaker 2>the water that's not too deep,</v>

2042
01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:35.900
<v Speaker 2>you don't have sharks,</v>

2043
01:00:35.901 --> 01:00:38.270
<v Speaker 2>but it's deep enough to keep the leopards away.</v>

2044
01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2045
01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:39.160
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2046
01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2047
01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:39.981
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

2048
01:00:39.981 --> 01:00:41.960
<v Speaker 2>and it's easier to walk on the beach,</v>

2049
01:00:41.961 --> 01:00:42.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2050
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:43.070
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

2051
01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:46.670
<v Speaker 2>that was the root of the huge exodus that went around the world,</v>

2052
01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:50.180
<v Speaker 2>but sea levels were about 300 feet lower than.</v>

2053
01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:51.080
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2054
01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.970
<v Speaker 2>So the stuff they're finding,</v>

2055
01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:53.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2056
01:00:53.511 --> 01:00:56.990
<v Speaker 2>the whatever the stone tools or the remains that there,</v>

2057
01:00:56.991 --> 01:00:59.230
<v Speaker 2>they're finding from a 30,</v>

2058
01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:00.380
<v Speaker 2>40,000 years ago,</v>

2059
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:02.720
<v Speaker 2>those weren't typical at all.</v>

2060
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:04.550
<v Speaker 2>The typical people were down on the beach.</v>

2061
01:01:04.551 --> 01:01:09.551
<v Speaker 2>So those must have been hunting parties or people who were exiled or whatever.</v>

2062
01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:11.300
<v Speaker 2>But they weren't at all typical.</v>

2063
01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:12.111
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

2064
01:01:12.111 --> 01:01:17.111
<v Speaker 2>So I bet we're missing a lot of the fossils and the little bits of evidence of</v>

2065
01:01:17.511 --> 01:01:18.770
<v Speaker 2>those people that lived on the beach,</v>

2066
01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.000
<v Speaker 2>which was the majority of the people.</v>

2067
01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.430
<v Speaker 2>And that's the stuff that's a representative.</v>

2068
01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:27.820
<v Speaker 2>So it's pretty weird to build your image of a society based on evidence that you</v>

2069
01:01:28.971 --> 01:01:29.630
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2070
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:31.190
<v Speaker 2>is extraordinary,</v>

2071
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2072
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:33.530
<v Speaker 2>but that's what we do because that's all we got.</v>

2073
01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.440
<v Speaker 5>I can remember really clearly being in college,</v>

2074
01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:36.740
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2075
01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.180
<v Speaker 5>thinking about human history,</v>

2076
01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:38.700
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2077
01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:39.160
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2078
01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember what the subject of the class was,</v>

2079
01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:46.520
<v Speaker 5>but then I remember being in class and just getting an idea just for the first</v>

2080
01:01:46.521 --> 01:01:46.761
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

2081
01:01:46.761 --> 01:01:46.990
<v Speaker 5>but in,</v>

2082
01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:51.990
<v Speaker 5>in very roughly of how little we know about just what the fuck actually happened</v>

2083
01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.250
<v Speaker 5>when you really start reading books about events and,</v>

2084
01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:58.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2085
01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:02.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm reading about like I was reading about custer's last stand and um,</v>

2086
01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:03.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2087
01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:03.800
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2088
01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:04.580
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2089
01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:08.340
<v Speaker 5>the account of the Indians account and the survivors account and know,</v>

2090
01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:09.950
<v Speaker 5>trying to piece it all together.</v>

2091
01:02:09.951 --> 01:02:10.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2092
01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:10.290
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2093
01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:10.971
<v Speaker 5>how crazy is it?</v>

2094
01:02:10.971 --> 01:02:14.750
<v Speaker 5>Is really difficult to piece this together in my head.</v>

2095
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.823
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2096
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:21.130
<v Speaker 5>but today I can watch September happened or I can watch a plane hit the tower.</v>

2097
01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:27.171
<v Speaker 5>I can look the way we have recorded things today is so vastly more intricate</v>

2098
01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.950
<v Speaker 5>that when I look at what I know of,</v>

2099
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:32.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2100
01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.360
<v Speaker 5>jfk getting shot,</v>

2101
01:02:33.361 --> 01:02:35.880
<v Speaker 5>what I know of seeing troops in Vietnam,</v>

2102
01:02:35.881 --> 01:02:37.570
<v Speaker 5>like this history that is,</v>

2103
01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:38.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2104
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:43.370
<v Speaker 5>that I think of when you look at how little we know about 10,000 years ago,</v>

2105
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:45.210
<v Speaker 5>30,000 years ago,</v>

2106
01:02:45.211 --> 01:02:46.290
<v Speaker 5>40,000 years ago,</v>

2107
01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:50.880
<v Speaker 5>and then the idea that the only way you find things as if people died in like a</v>

2108
01:02:50.881 --> 01:02:55.881
<v Speaker 5>volcano or a mud slide because you got to get a fossil or fell into a peat bog.</v>

2109
01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.010
<v Speaker 5>It's like how many people fall into peat bogs?</v>

2110
01:02:59.370 --> 01:02:59.880
<v Speaker 5>How much,</v>

2111
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2112
01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:02.250
<v Speaker 5>not enough fucking crazy.</v>

2113
01:03:02.251 --> 01:03:06.020
<v Speaker 5>What if all the smart people just rotted in the ground and then go into this</v>

2114
01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:06.940
<v Speaker 5>fucking bug?</v>

2115
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:11.550
<v Speaker 5>It was a whole race of super intelligent people that never went into peat bogs</v>

2116
01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:12.030
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>

2117
01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:12.690
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2118
01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:13.170
<v Speaker 6>the earth.</v>

2119
01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:16.080
<v Speaker 6>The first neanderthal remains that were found,</v>

2120
01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.313
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2121
01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:20.820
<v Speaker 6>were like hunched over and sort of deformed.</v>

2122
01:03:20.821 --> 01:03:22.320
<v Speaker 6>And so for a long time,</v>

2123
01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:25.740
<v Speaker 6>the image of a neanderthal was this deformed crazy.</v>

2124
01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.730
<v Speaker 6>Turns out that was like a really diseased individual,</v>

2125
01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:30.121
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2126
01:03:30.121 --> 01:03:31.430
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't a typical neanderthal.</v>

2127
01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:31.771
<v Speaker 6>Listen,</v>

2128
01:03:31.771 --> 01:03:34.770
<v Speaker 6>it isn't a typical data finding them very damaged,</v>

2129
01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:37.080
<v Speaker 6>especially their spines.</v>

2130
01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.480
<v Speaker 6>And like there's a lot of times they're really fun.</v>

2131
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:40.483
<v Speaker 6>A lot of.</v>

2132
01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:40.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2133
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:45.660
<v Speaker 6>a lot of hunting accidents and also apparently a lot of wear and tear on the</v>

2134
01:03:45.661 --> 01:03:46.680
<v Speaker 6>teeth and stuff.</v>

2135
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:47.280
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2136
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:47.671
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2137
01:03:47.671 --> 01:03:48.504
<v Speaker 6>I would imagine.</v>

2138
01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:49.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2139
01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:49.460
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2140
01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.293
<v Speaker 6>or tunnels.</v>

2141
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:52.163
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2142
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:53.430
<v Speaker 6>Anyway.</v>

2143
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.881
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2144
01:03:53.881 --> 01:03:54.420
<v Speaker 5>It's um,</v>

2145
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:55.030
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

2146
01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:56.460
<v Speaker 5>it's really strange.</v>

2147
01:03:56.461 --> 01:03:56.631
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2148
01:03:56.631 --> 01:03:59.250
<v Speaker 5>I've often said that human beings today,</v>

2149
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.810
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like waking up in the middle of history as a person,</v>

2150
01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:05.280
<v Speaker 5>as an individual.</v>

2151
01:04:05.281 --> 01:04:08.970
<v Speaker 5>I've felt that way sometimes watching a documentary or reading a book about</v>

2152
01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:12.570
<v Speaker 5>something or trying to imagine what it's been like several hundred years ago.</v>

2153
01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:13.530
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2154
01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:17.250
<v Speaker 5>all this has happened already and it's all real clear.</v>

2155
01:04:17.251 --> 01:04:18.930
<v Speaker 5>You can sort of piece it together and go.</v>

2156
01:04:18.931 --> 01:04:21.630
<v Speaker 5>And then we got here and it's like we woke up,</v>

2157
01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:22.621
<v Speaker 5>we woke up and go,</v>

2158
01:04:22.621 --> 01:04:22.831
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

2159
01:04:22.831 --> 01:04:23.490
<v Speaker 5>where are we?</v>

2160
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:24.060
<v Speaker 5>Where are we?</v>

2161
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:24.930
<v Speaker 5>Where on earth.</v>

2162
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:25.550
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2163
01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:26.383
<v Speaker 5>How do we get to earth?</v>

2164
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:26.581
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2165
01:04:26.581 --> 01:04:29.070
<v Speaker 5>this is what we've calculated and they lay out a piece of paper,</v>

2166
01:04:29.071 --> 01:04:29.340
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2167
01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.520
<v Speaker 5>earth is near the sun and the sun is surrounded by this other planets.</v>

2168
01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.380
<v Speaker 5>Does another earth Muslim maybe?</v>

2169
01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:35.370
<v Speaker 5>Probably most likely.</v>

2170
01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.900
<v Speaker 5>Actually it's infinite.</v>

2171
01:04:36.901 --> 01:04:38.580
<v Speaker 5>So every possibility will exist.</v>

2172
01:04:38.590 --> 01:04:39.720
<v Speaker 5>Infinite numbers of times.</v>

2173
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:40.800
<v Speaker 5>That's the real infinite.</v>

2174
01:04:40.801 --> 01:04:41.131
<v Speaker 5>So we're like,</v>

2175
01:04:41.131 --> 01:04:41.401
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2176
01:04:41.401 --> 01:04:43.610
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

2177
01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:44.100
<v Speaker 5>And then someone goes,</v>

2178
01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:44.401
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

2179
01:04:44.401 --> 01:04:45.330
<v Speaker 5>I figured some shit out.</v>

2180
01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.530
<v Speaker 5>It's called quantum theory and you're like,</v>

2181
01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.670
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are you saying?</v>

2182
01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.590
<v Speaker 5>And then dude,</v>

2183
01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:49.710
<v Speaker 5>there's gorillas.</v>

2184
01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:50.760
<v Speaker 5>You'd go to the jungle,</v>

2185
01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:52.260
<v Speaker 5>they found fucking gorilla.</v>

2186
01:04:52.261 --> 01:04:52.771
<v Speaker 5>They're big,</v>

2187
01:04:52.771 --> 01:04:53.604
<v Speaker 5>they're black,</v>

2188
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:54.970
<v Speaker 5>they're sorta human.</v>

2189
01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.640
<v Speaker 5>Like get the fuck Outta here.</v>

2190
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:57.301
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you,</v>

2191
01:04:57.301 --> 01:04:58.490
<v Speaker 5>there's monsters out there.</v>

2192
01:04:58.620 --> 01:04:59.300
<v Speaker 5>Like all that was,</v>

2193
01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:00.540
<v Speaker 5>that's the 18 hundreds.</v>

2194
01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:01.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean they didn't,</v>

2195
01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:01.950
<v Speaker 5>they didn't.</v>

2196
01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:05.080
<v Speaker 5>The Western world didn't know the existence of gorillas until the 18 hundreds.</v>

2197
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:10.640
<v Speaker 5>So it's kind of fascinating when you really think of like where we are right now</v>

2198
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:13.703
<v Speaker 5>and how,</v>

2199
01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:15.780
<v Speaker 5>how much we know about how we got here</v>

2200
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:19.390
<v Speaker 6>and you and you didn't know Bonobos till the 19 seventies,</v>

2201
01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:20.171
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2202
01:05:20.171 --> 01:05:21.310
<v Speaker 6>are really start studying.</v>

2203
01:05:21.311 --> 01:05:21.521
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2204
01:05:21.521 --> 01:05:23.680
<v Speaker 6>they thought they were just a sub species of chimp.</v>

2205
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:24.541
<v Speaker 6>They called them pigmeat.</v>

2206
01:05:24.541 --> 01:05:25.280
<v Speaker 6>Chimps.</v>

2207
01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.540
<v Speaker 6>Turns out they're so completely different from chimps that they.</v>

2208
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:33.430
<v Speaker 6>They've forced us to completely reevaluate the primate origins of human beings.</v>

2209
01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:34.081
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2210
01:05:34.081 --> 01:05:38.700
<v Speaker 4>It really threw a monkey wrench in the whole explanation of why we're so warring</v>

2211
01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:40.250
<v Speaker 4>and horrible violent.</v>

2212
01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.030
<v Speaker 4>Want to do that?</v>

2213
01:05:42.031 --> 01:05:42.600
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God,</v>

2214
01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.433
<v Speaker 4>no pun intended,</v>

2215
01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:47.040
<v Speaker 4>but the functional note Banabos are like Super Sexual.</v>

2216
01:05:47.041 --> 01:05:47.251
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2217
01:05:47.251 --> 01:05:50.700
<v Speaker 4>they solve everything with sex and the sex.</v>

2218
01:05:50.701 --> 01:05:52.860
<v Speaker 4>They don't have as the mother doesn't have sex with a son.</v>

2219
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.461
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

2220
01:05:53.461 --> 01:05:54.570
<v Speaker 4>You did your homework.</v>

2221
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:56.790
<v Speaker 4>Now I've just been fascinated by monkeys.</v>

2222
01:05:57.110 --> 01:05:58.440
<v Speaker 4>My whole life's apes.</v>

2223
01:05:58.620 --> 01:05:59.070
<v Speaker 4>Champs.</v>

2224
01:05:59.070 --> 01:05:59.730
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

2225
01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:00.361
<v Speaker 4>Mostly Champs.</v>

2226
01:06:00.361 --> 01:06:01.410
<v Speaker 4>But other apes as well.</v>

2227
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.750
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2228
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:02.071
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

2229
01:06:02.071 --> 01:06:02.530
<v Speaker 4>apes.</v>

2230
01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:03.760
<v Speaker 4>I know monkey sounds cooler though,</v>

2231
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:04.810
<v Speaker 4>among gender.</v>

2232
01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.440
<v Speaker 4>Transgender monkeys have tails.</v>

2233
01:06:07.441 --> 01:06:08.970
<v Speaker 4>That's your right.</v>

2234
01:06:08.971 --> 01:06:12.060
<v Speaker 4>Monkey balls is such a good phrase,</v>

2235
01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:12.980
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2236
01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:13.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2237
01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:16.110
<v Speaker 4>I use it all the time even though I'm always talking about eight balls,</v>

2238
01:06:16.111 --> 01:06:17.820
<v Speaker 4>but the eight ball just doesn't ring.</v>

2239
01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:18.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2240
01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:19.421
<v Speaker 4>That's why I.</v>

2241
01:06:19.421 --> 01:06:23.070
<v Speaker 4>my one of my comedy specialist was talking monkeys in space because talking apes</v>

2242
01:06:23.071 --> 01:06:24.120
<v Speaker 4>in space just didn't.</v>

2243
01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:25.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2244
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.370
<v Speaker 4>It's missing something in Spanish.</v>

2245
01:06:26.371 --> 01:06:27.580
<v Speaker 4>There's no word for Ayp,</v>

2246
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:28.650
<v Speaker 4>actually real,</v>

2247
01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:32.600
<v Speaker 4>which makes things complicated in translating our book to Spanish.</v>

2248
01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.750
<v Speaker 4>So is it just primates?</v>

2249
01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:35.390
<v Speaker 4>Various premium names.</v>

2250
01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:35.971
<v Speaker 4>Simeon.</v>

2251
01:06:35.971 --> 01:06:36.590
<v Speaker 4>Simeon.</v>

2252
01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:36.950
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2253
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:37.740
<v Speaker 4>That's another good one.</v>

2254
01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:38.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2255
01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:38.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2256
01:06:38.610 --> 01:06:39.241
<v Speaker 4>The monkey,</v>

2257
01:06:39.241 --> 01:06:39.871
<v Speaker 4>the monkey wrench.</v>

2258
01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:41.880
<v Speaker 4>That was thrown in though to get back to the bonobos.</v>

2259
01:06:42.110 --> 01:06:43.410
<v Speaker 4>Bonobos are not violent.</v>

2260
01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:43.950
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>

2261
01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:46.980
<v Speaker 4>They don't kill other Benobos then they just fuck all the time.</v>

2262
01:06:47.410 --> 01:06:51.990
<v Speaker 4>Friends do all the great Dutch primatologist who's responsible for bringing</v>

2263
01:06:51.991 --> 01:06:55.200
<v Speaker 4>Benobos to public light to a large extent.</v>

2264
01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:58.020
<v Speaker 4>He said chimps use violence to get sex,</v>

2265
01:06:58.021 --> 01:06:58.620
<v Speaker 4>but no booze.</v>

2266
01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.420
<v Speaker 4>Use Sex to avoid violence.</v>

2267
01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:04.850
<v Speaker 4>And bonobos are very interesting and as you know,</v>

2268
01:07:05.410 --> 01:07:10.410
<v Speaker 6>people understand the chimps and Bonobos are our two closest primate relatives</v>

2269
01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:15.540
<v Speaker 6>by far and in fact there we're more closely related to them then they are to any</v>

2270
01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:17.680
<v Speaker 6>other primates.</v>

2271
01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.600
<v Speaker 6>So if you go to a zoo and you're looking at it,</v>

2272
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:20.710
<v Speaker 6>you know chimp cage,</v>

2273
01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:22.330
<v Speaker 6>that champ is more shares,</v>

2274
01:07:22.331 --> 01:07:26.170
<v Speaker 6>more DNA with you than he does with a gorilla or an orangutan or anything,</v>

2275
01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:26.441
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2276
01:07:26.441 --> 01:07:26.830
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2277
01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:27.581
<v Speaker 6>So in fact,</v>

2278
01:07:27.581 --> 01:07:31.060
<v Speaker 6>jared diamond wrote a book called the third chimpanzee where he argued that</v>

2279
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.661
<v Speaker 6>humans,</v>

2280
01:07:31.661 --> 01:07:35.380
<v Speaker 6>chimps and Bonobos are basically three subspecies of chimpanzee,</v>

2281
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.270
<v Speaker 6>were so closely related,</v>

2282
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:41.050
<v Speaker 6>were more closely related to them than an Indian elephant is to an African</v>

2283
01:07:41.051 --> 01:07:41.884
<v Speaker 6>elephant.</v>

2284
01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:42.221
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2285
01:07:42.221 --> 01:07:44.320
<v Speaker 6>We're like super close in terms of DNA.</v>

2286
01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:45.251
<v Speaker 6>So they're.</v>

2287
01:07:45.251 --> 01:07:46.900
<v Speaker 6>But they're very close to each other.</v>

2288
01:07:46.901 --> 01:07:49.570
<v Speaker 6>So I think of it as like if I've got twin brothers,</v>

2289
01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:52.060
<v Speaker 6>they're closest to each other,</v>

2290
01:07:52.061 --> 01:07:55.990
<v Speaker 6>but after each other comes me and I'm equally related to each of them.</v>

2291
01:07:56.290 --> 01:07:57.101
<v Speaker 6>So the champ,</v>

2292
01:07:57.101 --> 01:07:57.611
<v Speaker 6>as you say,</v>

2293
01:07:57.611 --> 01:08:00.400
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of bad ass kind of very male dominated,</v>

2294
01:08:00.401 --> 01:08:01.750
<v Speaker 6>very hierarchical,</v>

2295
01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:05.240
<v Speaker 6>kind of conflictive can be really nasty,</v>

2296
01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:05.520
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2297
01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.540
<v Speaker 6>rip people's faces off in Connecticut.</v>

2298
01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:12.900
<v Speaker 6>But the Bonobo in 50 years of observation in the wild and in captivity,</v>

2299
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:19.080
<v Speaker 6>no one has ever seen Urbanova kill or rape and other Banaba that'll have to</v>

2300
01:08:19.101 --> 01:08:19.311
<v Speaker 6>rape.</v>

2301
01:08:19.311 --> 01:08:20.600
<v Speaker 6>They just fuck they don't do it.</v>

2302
01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:21.920
<v Speaker 6>If you want to not get raped,</v>

2303
01:08:21.921 --> 01:08:23.960
<v Speaker 6>just give it up every way you look.</v>

2304
01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:25.603
<v Speaker 6>That's ridiculous.</v>

2305
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.670
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2306
01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:27.800
<v Speaker 6>we can never live like them.</v>

2307
01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:28.581
<v Speaker 6>I'd say.</v>

2308
01:08:28.581 --> 01:08:29.780
<v Speaker 6>I do not agree with that.</v>

2309
01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm just saying it in,</v>

2310
01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.420
<v Speaker 6>in the animal world,</v>

2311
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:33.291
<v Speaker 6>that's what they do,</v>

2312
01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:33.621
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2313
01:08:33.621 --> 01:08:33.831
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2314
01:08:33.831 --> 01:08:34.241
<v Speaker 6>that's where they,</v>

2315
01:08:34.241 --> 01:08:35.540
<v Speaker 6>they never killed a rapist.</v>

2316
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.650
<v Speaker 6>Very interesting.</v>

2317
01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:38.150
<v Speaker 6>When you're talking about animals,</v>

2318
01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:43.180
<v Speaker 6>like a lot of people say that orangutan sex is rape because the male chases the</v>

2319
01:08:43.611 --> 01:08:47.300
<v Speaker 6>female through the tree tops and she's screaming and apparently trying to get</v>

2320
01:08:47.301 --> 01:08:47.750
<v Speaker 6>away.</v>

2321
01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:48.480
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2322
01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:50.230
<v Speaker 6>That's a dolphin three isn't.</v>

2323
01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:54.410
<v Speaker 6>There is a indication of Dolphin rave with dolphins are also involved in mass</v>

2324
01:08:54.411 --> 01:08:55.244
<v Speaker 6>genocide.</v>

2325
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.850
<v Speaker 6>Infanticide rather killed baby dolphins.</v>

2326
01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:00.740
<v Speaker 6>They kill them to get the females to breed.</v>

2327
01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.280
<v Speaker 6>That's typical of,</v>

2328
01:09:02.290 --> 01:09:03.000
<v Speaker 6>of uh,</v>

2329
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.730
<v Speaker 6>a lot of mammals learning ends.</v>

2330
01:09:04.731 --> 01:09:05.460
<v Speaker 6>Do that,</v>

2331
01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:05.930
<v Speaker 6>do this,</v>

2332
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:06.370
<v Speaker 6>do that.</v>

2333
01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:10.880
<v Speaker 6>When there's an Alpha male gorillas when there's an Alpha male and he takes</v>

2334
01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:11.714
<v Speaker 6>over,</v>

2335
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:13.070
<v Speaker 6>often he'll kill the.</v>

2336
01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.510
<v Speaker 6>Or if there's a coalition,</v>

2337
01:09:14.511 --> 01:09:17.360
<v Speaker 6>they'll kill the babies to get them back.</v>

2338
01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:18.640
<v Speaker 6>The women back into estrous.</v>

2339
01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:20.453
<v Speaker 6>It's brutal.</v>

2340
01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:21.951
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

2341
01:09:21.951 --> 01:09:23.090
<v Speaker 6>that's one of the theories,</v>

2342
01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:24.320
<v Speaker 6>Sarah Hrdy,</v>

2343
01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:25.760
<v Speaker 6>who's written widely,</v>

2344
01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:28.400
<v Speaker 6>she's very well known primatologist anthropologist.</v>

2345
01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:29.691
<v Speaker 6>One of,</v>

2346
01:09:29.691 --> 01:09:30.230
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2347
01:09:30.230 --> 01:09:34.700
<v Speaker 6>the theories is that the reason that females are promiscuous in some primate</v>

2348
01:09:34.701 --> 01:09:39.701
<v Speaker 6>species is to confuse paternity so that males won't be tempted to kill babies in</v>

2349
01:09:40.761 --> 01:09:44.210
<v Speaker 6>order to get women back into a female back into estrous.</v>

2350
01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:46.190
<v Speaker 6>And that's the current thinking on dolphins as well.</v>

2351
01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:46.850
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>

2352
01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:47.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2353
01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.730
<v Speaker 6>Dolphin females are known to be like the slots of the ocean.</v>

2354
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:51.251
<v Speaker 6>They have sex,</v>

2355
01:09:51.251 --> 01:09:52.400
<v Speaker 6>sex as many guys as possible.</v>

2356
01:09:52.401 --> 01:09:53.250
<v Speaker 6>So the guy comes over,</v>

2357
01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:54.093
<v Speaker 6>he goes,</v>

2358
01:09:54.730 --> 01:09:55.450
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2359
01:09:55.450 --> 01:09:58.190
<v Speaker 6>So while they have that bond with that person,</v>

2360
01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:02.750
<v Speaker 6>what do they establish as the main reason why the chimpanzees and Bonobos</v>

2361
01:10:02.751 --> 01:10:02.911
<v Speaker 6>though?</v>

2362
01:10:02.911 --> 01:10:04.100
<v Speaker 6>So genetically similar,</v>

2363
01:10:04.101 --> 01:10:05.450
<v Speaker 6>so different behaviorally.</v>

2364
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.890
<v Speaker 6>That's a really good question.</v>

2365
01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:07.753
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>

2366
01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:10.940
<v Speaker 6>there's no perfect theory.</v>

2367
01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.920
<v Speaker 6>The best known theory is that,</v>

2368
01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.240
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2369
01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.770
<v Speaker 6>the chimps and Bonobos,</v>

2370
01:10:15.771 --> 01:10:19.190
<v Speaker 6>we're the same species and there was a change in the Congo,</v>

2371
01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:19.820
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2372
01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:21.860
<v Speaker 6>the root of the Congo River,</v>

2373
01:10:21.861 --> 01:10:25.580
<v Speaker 6>I think about 5 million years ago and that's been verified.</v>

2374
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.840
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2375
01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:31.840
<v Speaker 6>so one population got isolated on the south side of the Congo and the other on</v>

2376
01:10:32.511 --> 01:10:37.100
<v Speaker 6>the north and the ones on the south became Benobos.</v>

2377
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:40.010
<v Speaker 6>The ones on the north became chimps.</v>

2378
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.020
<v Speaker 6>And the idea,</v>

2379
01:10:42.021 --> 01:10:42.920
<v Speaker 6>and this is um,</v>

2380
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:45.200
<v Speaker 6>Richard Wrangham at Harvard proposed this idea,</v>

2381
01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:47.870
<v Speaker 6>is that the chimps on the north,</v>

2382
01:10:47.871 --> 01:10:51.290
<v Speaker 6>we're competing with gorillas for some of the same food sources,</v>

2383
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:54.650
<v Speaker 6>whereas there are no gorilla south of Congo,</v>

2384
01:10:54.651 --> 01:10:57.320
<v Speaker 6>so the Banabos weren't competing for those food sources,</v>

2385
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:58.640
<v Speaker 6>so they didn't have to get gangster.</v>

2386
01:10:58.810 --> 01:10:59.643
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2387
01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:04.660
<v Speaker 6>But the problem with that theory is that it basically dismisses the assumptions</v>

2388
01:11:08.571 --> 01:11:11.810
<v Speaker 6>of Darwinian evolution based on Malthus,</v>

2389
01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 6>which is that any population</v>

2390
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.130
<v Speaker 2>will quickly grow to the point where the,</v>

2391
01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:19.650
<v Speaker 2>where the food resources are saturated.</v>

2392
01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.700
<v Speaker 2>And so you get competition between individuals for whatever's there,</v>

2393
01:11:23.730 --> 01:11:24.563
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2394
01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:29.850
<v Speaker 2>He seems to be saying the population of Banabos never grew to the point where</v>

2395
01:11:29.851 --> 01:11:31.200
<v Speaker 2>they were competing for food,</v>

2396
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:34.080
<v Speaker 2>therefore they never had to get competitive.</v>

2397
01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.490
<v Speaker 2>If that's true,</v>

2398
01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:37.290
<v Speaker 2>that's a radical statement.</v>

2399
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.360
<v Speaker 2>It happens to be a statement I agree with.</v>

2400
01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:41.670
<v Speaker 2>I've made the same statement about early humans.</v>

2401
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:42.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>

2402
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.871
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2403
01:11:42.871 --> 01:11:43.920
<v Speaker 2>early humans were like,</v>

2404
01:11:43.921 --> 01:11:44.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2405
01:11:44.131 --> 01:11:46.530
<v Speaker 2>these pythons that are introduced into the everglades.</v>

2406
01:11:46.531 --> 01:11:46.891
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2407
01:11:46.891 --> 01:11:47.371
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

2408
01:11:47.371 --> 01:11:50.700
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing else here competing for this niche.</v>

2409
01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:51.081
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2410
01:11:51.081 --> 01:11:54.230
<v Speaker 5>it kind of makes sense if you really think about it in terms of how we look at</v>

2411
01:11:54.231 --> 01:11:55.011
<v Speaker 5>socialism,</v>

2412
01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:57.920
<v Speaker 5>because what are the number one complaint from manly man about socialism?</v>

2413
01:11:58.130 --> 01:11:59.300
<v Speaker 5>It's going to make a soft,</v>

2414
01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:02.800
<v Speaker 5>which are fucking pussies have just socialists out there yet.</v>

2415
01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:03.770
<v Speaker 5>That's the idea.</v>

2416
01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.790
<v Speaker 5>The idea is to soften everybody the fuck up to reduce the need of competition</v>

2417
01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:09.200
<v Speaker 5>and to a lot of people,</v>

2418
01:12:09.201 --> 01:12:13.310
<v Speaker 5>especially people that have adopted sort of a advantageous positions,</v>

2419
01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:14.660
<v Speaker 5>they look at that as like,</v>

2420
01:12:14.661 --> 01:12:15.220
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2421
01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:16.100
<v Speaker 5>fucking plus age,</v>

2422
01:12:16.101 --> 01:12:16.934
<v Speaker 5>you gotta earn it.</v>

2423
01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:17.480
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2424
01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:20.270
<v Speaker 5>socialism is the idea.</v>

2425
01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.970
<v Speaker 5>It sort of makes sense if you look at the buffalo community,</v>

2426
01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:23.853
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2427
01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:24.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2428
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:28.340
<v Speaker 5>They didn't have competition so everybody just chilled out and they developed a</v>

2429
01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:31.010
<v Speaker 5>style of being that's more chilled out.</v>

2430
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2431
01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:32.600
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2432
01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.330
<v Speaker 2>It is a great story.</v>

2433
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:35.650
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a guy you should interview.</v>

2434
01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:36.970
<v Speaker 2>I think I mentioned him last time.</v>

2435
01:12:36.971 --> 01:12:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Robert Sapolsky.</v>

2436
01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.021
<v Speaker 5>I tried.</v>

2437
01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:39.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying.</v>

2438
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:40.800
<v Speaker 5>He's in the middle of teaching.</v>

2439
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:41.211
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2440
01:12:41.211 --> 01:12:41.810
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2441
01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:42.643
<v Speaker 5>So you've been in touch</v>

2442
01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.640
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

2443
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.790
<v Speaker 5>I learned everything about toxo plasma,</v>

2444
01:12:46.791 --> 01:12:51.560
<v Speaker 5>which this podcast is for him to death and they got so tired of talking about</v>

2445
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:52.423
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>

2446
01:12:52.570 --> 01:12:53.140
<v Speaker 5>Do you,</v>

2447
01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:54.350
<v Speaker 5>do you tell the same story?</v>

2448
01:12:54.351 --> 01:12:54.891
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes?</v>

2449
01:12:54.891 --> 01:12:55.071
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2450
01:12:55.071 --> 01:12:57.020
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I get tweets from people like,</v>

2451
01:12:57.021 --> 01:12:57.510
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

2452
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.690
<v Speaker 5>great,</v>

2453
01:12:57.690 --> 01:12:58.521
<v Speaker 5>love your podcast,</v>

2454
01:12:58.521 --> 01:13:00.080
<v Speaker 5>but you told that story three times.</v>

2455
01:13:00.081 --> 01:13:01.310
<v Speaker 5>Like how do you keep track?</v>

2456
01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.030
<v Speaker 5>It's really hard when you're having a guest if the guest is not aware of the</v>

2457
01:13:05.031 --> 01:13:07.670
<v Speaker 5>information because I don't want to like write it down and say,</v>

2458
01:13:07.671 --> 01:13:07.911
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2459
01:13:07.911 --> 01:13:09.710
<v Speaker 5>when the podcast is over I got to tell you about</v>

2460
01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:12.820
<v Speaker 5>the changes the way you behave.</v>

2461
01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:13.460
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2462
01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:16.250
<v Speaker 5>so sometimes if it's a new gas and they don't know about it,</v>

2463
01:13:16.251 --> 01:13:16.730
<v Speaker 5>I kinda,</v>

2464
01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:17.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm sort of forced to.</v>

2465
01:13:17.811 --> 01:13:19.670
<v Speaker 5>I tried to give them the cliff notes version of it.</v>

2466
01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:20.870
<v Speaker 5>I know about it.</v>

2467
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:23.210
<v Speaker 5>So pasky had an amazing video,</v>

2468
01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:23.710
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2469
01:13:23.710 --> 01:13:28.370
<v Speaker 5>where he detailed and it even went into that when he was a med student.</v>

2470
01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:33.760
<v Speaker 5>They would find a cadaver's like guys who died on motorcycles and there was a</v>

2471
01:13:34.101 --> 01:13:39.101
<v Speaker 5>disproportionate amount of them that tested positive for toxoplasma takers,</v>

2472
01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:40.971
<v Speaker 5>risk takers,</v>

2473
01:13:40.971 --> 01:13:44.210
<v Speaker 5>that the parasite literally gets you to take risks.</v>

2474
01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:48.620
<v Speaker 5>And that there's a direct correlation between toxo plasma infestation and</v>

2475
01:13:48.621 --> 01:13:50.090
<v Speaker 5>successful soccer teams.</v>

2476
01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:51.373
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2477
01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.450
<v Speaker 5>So they all have cats in the locker room.</v>

2478
01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:53.871
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2479
01:13:53.871 --> 01:13:54.081
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2480
01:13:54.081 --> 01:13:55.610
<v Speaker 5>this is two thoughts behind that.</v>

2481
01:13:55.611 --> 01:13:57.590
<v Speaker 5>One is it could be purely,</v>

2482
01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:00.880
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't cause it's not,</v>

2483
01:14:00.881 --> 01:14:05.881
<v Speaker 5>it's not in the fact that's just a correlation correlation in that it's just,</v>

2484
01:14:06.951 --> 01:14:09.050
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with people that live in impoverished areas.</v>

2485
01:14:09.051 --> 01:14:11.740
<v Speaker 5>People in impoverished areas have higher incidents of cats,</v>

2486
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:17.050
<v Speaker 5>hired incidences of feral cats is more likely toxoplasma that they're also more</v>

2487
01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:22.051
<v Speaker 5>desperate and maybe more invested in soccer and more aggressive in their</v>

2488
01:14:22.661 --> 01:14:25.210
<v Speaker 5>approach because it means so much to them because it's a way out,</v>

2489
01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:25.901
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2490
01:14:25.901 --> 01:14:28.780
<v Speaker 5>much like impoverished people in America sometimes,</v>

2491
01:14:28.781 --> 01:14:29.171
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2492
01:14:29.171 --> 01:14:29.471
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2493
01:14:29.471 --> 01:14:33.190
<v Speaker 5>they make some of the greatest athletic stories or someone who came from nothing</v>

2494
01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:36.250
<v Speaker 5>and was so never wanted to go back to that again and had so much drive.</v>

2495
01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:39.460
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know if he can act absolutely connected two of them together.</v>

2496
01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.200
<v Speaker 5>But it is a fascinating theory.</v>

2497
01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:41.590
<v Speaker 5>You</v>

2498
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:43.300
<v Speaker 6>talking about taking risks.</v>

2499
01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:44.110
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2500
01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:45.190
<v Speaker 6>as I've gotten older,</v>

2501
01:14:45.610 --> 01:14:48.400
<v Speaker 6>I've developed this concept I call the bucket list.</v>

2502
01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:51.220
<v Speaker 6>So the,</v>

2503
01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:51.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2504
01:14:51.490 --> 01:14:53.890
<v Speaker 6>the bucket list is stuff you want to do before you die.</v>

2505
01:14:53.891 --> 01:14:54.380
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2506
01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:58.180
<v Speaker 6>But like I turned 51 a couple of weeks ago and I'm at the stage now where I've</v>

2507
01:14:58.181 --> 01:15:01.390
<v Speaker 6>got a fuck it list were things I used to think I wanted to do before I die.</v>

2508
01:15:01.391 --> 01:15:02.081
<v Speaker 6>And now I'm like,</v>

2509
01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:02.260
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2510
01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:02.651
<v Speaker 6>fuck it.</v>

2511
01:15:02.651 --> 01:15:03.130
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2512
01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:04.480
<v Speaker 6>like one g jumping.</v>

2513
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:04.711
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2514
01:15:04.711 --> 01:15:04.941
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2515
01:15:04.941 --> 01:15:05.281
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2516
01:15:05.281 --> 01:15:05.471
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

2517
01:15:05.471 --> 01:15:05.950
<v Speaker 6>Fuck it.</v>

2518
01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:07.750
<v Speaker 6>That's definitely on a fucking noisy.</v>

2519
01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:08.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2520
01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:09.730
<v Speaker 6>I'll show you a video.</v>

2521
01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:11.440
<v Speaker 6>A Guy Bungee jumps in his,</v>

2522
01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.270
<v Speaker 6>his cord was not long enough.</v>

2523
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:15.940
<v Speaker 6>Slice slams off the ground in agony.</v>

2524
01:15:15.941 --> 01:15:20.941
<v Speaker 6>And then with the body he has court is too long ago with his broken body slams</v>

2525
01:15:20.981 --> 01:15:25.540
<v Speaker 6>off the ground again and it does like several times he's got like a helmet</v>

2526
01:15:25.541 --> 01:15:29.500
<v Speaker 6>camera in the screens and he makes are horrific.</v>

2527
01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:30.573
<v Speaker 6>He didn't die.</v>

2528
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:33.370
<v Speaker 6>He lived because it slowed him down a little bit,</v>

2529
01:15:33.371 --> 01:15:38.320
<v Speaker 6>but I mean it just broke him and then spring up in the air and then smashed back</v>

2530
01:15:38.321 --> 01:15:39.130
<v Speaker 6>down again.</v>

2531
01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:39.281
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2532
01:15:39.281 --> 01:15:41.500
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if he lived after the video,</v>

2533
01:15:41.501 --> 01:15:44.170
<v Speaker 6>but he's alive during the video and it'll cure.</v>

2534
01:15:44.171 --> 01:15:45.820
<v Speaker 6>You have any ideas of bungee jumping?</v>

2535
01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:47.320
<v Speaker 6>I hope it wasn't Antosz point.</v>

2536
01:15:47.321 --> 01:15:48.154
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2537
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:49.510
<v Speaker 6>you probably covered it.</v>

2538
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:52.220
<v Speaker 6>He's probably got a fucking 10 minutes of his act about it.</v>

2539
01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:53.910
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

2540
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:54.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2541
01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:54.560
<v Speaker 6>He's,</v>

2542
01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.391
<v Speaker 6>he's covered everything.</v>

2543
01:15:55.391 --> 01:15:55.841
<v Speaker 6>Fucked up.</v>

2544
01:15:55.841 --> 01:15:58.210
<v Speaker 6>That's ever been released on the young Turks.</v>

2545
01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.440
<v Speaker 6>He's in the same building.</v>

2546
01:15:59.470 --> 01:15:59.671
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2547
01:15:59.671 --> 01:15:59.990
<v Speaker 6>isn't it?</v>

2548
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.290
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2549
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:00.550
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2550
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:05.050
<v Speaker 6>I did a show with Doug Stanhope recently who went and we did this thing where it</v>

2551
01:16:05.051 --> 01:16:08.350
<v Speaker 6>was a guy who was a lifelong virgin trying to give them advice,</v>

2552
01:16:09.850 --> 01:16:11.500
<v Speaker 6>but a bucket list.</v>

2553
01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:12.880
<v Speaker 6>That's a good one for the bucket list.</v>

2554
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:14.320
<v Speaker 6>Punchkick just bungee jumping.</v>

2555
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:15.663
<v Speaker 6>Skydiving.</v>

2556
01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.080
<v Speaker 6>I could be convinced to skydive if it was with some friends.</v>

2557
01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:21.573
<v Speaker 6>Fuck No.</v>

2558
01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:22.031
<v Speaker 6>Tell him.</v>

2559
01:16:22.031 --> 01:16:22.864
<v Speaker 6>Tell him the story.</v>

2560
01:16:23.890 --> 01:16:28.290
<v Speaker 6>My Dad was this girl that my dad worked with skydived all the time and every</v>

2561
01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.010
<v Speaker 6>know she always tried to get him to do it.</v>

2562
01:16:30.011 --> 01:16:33.610
<v Speaker 6>So finally he was going to do it and then like a week before you're supposed to</v>

2563
01:16:33.611 --> 01:16:34.140
<v Speaker 6>do it.</v>

2564
01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:34.750
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2565
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:38.490
<v Speaker 6>she jumped and heard a chute,</v>

2566
01:16:38.491 --> 01:16:38.981
<v Speaker 6>didn't open,</v>

2567
01:16:38.981 --> 01:16:42.550
<v Speaker 6>and then the reserve chute start tangling with the other shooter and then she</v>

2568
01:16:42.551 --> 01:16:42.970
<v Speaker 6>died.</v>

2569
01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:45.610
<v Speaker 6>So it's like my dad was supposed to do it like the following week or something.</v>

2570
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:46.870
<v Speaker 6>We can add that to the fuck.</v>

2571
01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:47.950

2614
01:17:57.771 --> 01:17:59.150
<v Speaker 6>Like there are these cloud formations,</v>

2615
01:17:59.151 --> 01:18:02.810
<v Speaker 6>it'll suck you up into them and when you're like in the cloud you don't know</v>

2616
01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:04.250
<v Speaker 6>what's up and what's down.</v>

<v Speaker 6>And so there are all these things you like.</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's like instrument control.</v>

2619
01:18:08.091 --> 01:18:09.020
<v Speaker 6>You have to like,</v>

2620
01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:11.450
<v Speaker 6>even if you think you're falling upward,</v>

2621
01:18:11.451 --> 01:18:13.040
<v Speaker 6>you have to pull the shit and fall.</v>

2622
01:18:13.041 --> 01:18:13.520
<v Speaker 6>And it's like,</v>

2623
01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:13.641

2625
01:18:15.170 --> 01:18:16.400
<v Speaker 6>What is the cloud formation?</v>

2626
01:18:16.401 --> 01:18:17.210
<v Speaker 6>That's sucks you up.</v>

2627
01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:17.871
<v Speaker 6>What's that all about?</v>

2628
01:18:17.871 --> 01:18:18.471
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember.</v>

2629
01:18:18.471 --> 01:18:19.520
<v Speaker 6>I just remember like,</v>

2630
01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:20.150
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2631
01:18:20.150 --> 01:18:21.910
<v Speaker 6>I will not go near those clouds.</v>

2632
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:23.600
<v Speaker 6>The wizard of Oz type of situation.</v>

2633
01:18:23.601 --> 01:18:24.210
<v Speaker 6>It was some,</v>

2634
01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:28.570
<v Speaker 6>some particular cloud formation that,</v>

2635
01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:30.620
<v Speaker 6>that has a really strong updraft.</v>

2636
01:18:30.621 --> 01:18:30.981
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2637
01:18:30.981 --> 01:18:31.420
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2638
01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:31.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2639
01:18:31.730 --> 01:18:34.070
<v Speaker 6>what's it called on the beach where you get sucked out to ocean,</v>

2640
01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:35.230
<v Speaker 6>the untitled,</v>

2641
01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.820
<v Speaker 6>like you have to go against it.</v>

2642
01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:40.180
<v Speaker 6>Not against it die.</v>

2643
01:18:40.181 --> 01:18:42.020
<v Speaker 6>I'm 90 degree angle.</v>

2644
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:43.820
<v Speaker 6>Not trying to get out of it.</v>

2645
01:18:43.821 --> 01:18:45.330
<v Speaker 6>Like you don't swim against the undertow,</v>

2646
01:18:45.331 --> 01:18:47.190
<v Speaker 6>you swim across the undertone,</v>

2647
01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:47.810
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2648
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:49.790
<v Speaker 6>Same thing in this case because you get sucked up.</v>

2649
01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:53.600
<v Speaker 6>Your body freezes and then they'll find you like far,</v>

2650
01:18:53.601 --> 01:18:54.350
<v Speaker 6>far away,</v>

2651
01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:55.183
<v Speaker 6>frozen,</v>

2652
01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:55.761
<v Speaker 6>solid.</v>

2653
01:18:55.761 --> 01:18:58.320
<v Speaker 6>Like it's either the iceman.</v>

2654
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2655
01:18:58.590 --> 01:19:00.190
<v Speaker 6>we didn't finish the story.</v>

2656
01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:03.370
<v Speaker 6>The reason why this guy didn't get smushed is because uh,</v>

2657
01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:08.050
<v Speaker 6>he like fell into the bottom of this crevasse and got covered and turned into a</v>

2658
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:12.830
<v Speaker 6>essentially like frozen dinner and a mummy frozen mummy.</v>

2659
01:19:13.690 --> 01:19:14.860
<v Speaker 6>So if people like,</v>

2660
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:15.361
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

2661
01:19:15.361 --> 01:19:16.340
<v Speaker 6>He never finished that story.</v>

2662
01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.680
<v Speaker 6>Do you know Brad Pitt has a tattoo of it.</v>

2663
01:19:18.681 --> 01:19:19.514
<v Speaker 6>See on his arm.</v>

2664
01:19:19.530 --> 01:19:21.310
<v Speaker 6>Doesn't really know he's really into etsy.</v>

2665
01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:22.160
<v Speaker 6>That's fascinating.</v>

2666
01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:22.640

<v Speaker 6>I guess he's just super into it.</v>

2669
01:19:24.941 --> 01:19:25.160

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.460
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2671
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:28.460
<v Speaker 6>maybe we'd have to ask Brad Pitt.</v>

2672
01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:30.650
<v Speaker 6>You've got a better chance of getting them on the phone the night.</v>

2673

<v Speaker 6>It's the most ridiculous commercials of all time because it's a guy who's a</v>

2715
01:20:41.131 --> 01:20:44.730
<v Speaker 6>fucking multimillionaire millionaire that you noticed and wear the stupid,</v>

2716
01:20:44.731 --> 01:20:45.490
<v Speaker 6>Stinky Shit.</v>

2717
01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:49.890
<v Speaker 6>His wife as much money as he does and he's done a little chanel number five</v>

2718
01:20:49.891 --> 01:20:54.300
<v Speaker 6>commercial and somebody has videos of him sucking a million bucks or something.</v>

2719
01:20:54.301 --> 01:20:55.170
<v Speaker 6>That's how they did it.</v>

2720
01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.760
<v Speaker 6>It's something missing or they,</v>

2721
01:20:57.930 --> 01:20:58.281
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2722
01:20:58.281 --> 01:20:59.670
<v Speaker 6>they promise to cure aids.</v>

2723
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.421
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2724
01:21:01.421 --> 01:21:02.470
<v Speaker 1>it really ends.</v>

2725
01:21:02.530 --> 01:21:03.363
<v Speaker 1>But we go on.</v>

2726
01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.040
<v Speaker 1>The world turns.</v>

2727
01:21:06.041 --> 01:21:07.110
<v Speaker 1>When we turned with it,</v>

2728
01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:08.690
<v Speaker 1>the world turns.</v>

2729
01:21:08.690 --> 01:21:09.010
<v Speaker 1>We turned.</v>

2730
01:21:09.010 --> 01:21:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Plans disappear.</v>

2731
01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Dreams take over</v>

2732
01:21:14.710 --> 01:21:15.820
<v Speaker 1>whenever I go.</v>

2733
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:18.220
<v Speaker 1>There you are.</v>

2734
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:21.600
<v Speaker 1>I love my faith.</v>

2735
01:21:25.210 --> 01:21:26.043
<v Speaker 6>Number five.</v>

2736
01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:32.830
<v Speaker 6>That's a fucking goddamn Saturday night live sketch.</v>

2737
01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:33.460
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2738
01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.030
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2739
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:37.360
<v Speaker 6>That does seem like a parody of a commercial starring.</v>

2740
01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:40.060
<v Speaker 6>It also seems like a parody of tree of life.</v>

2741
01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:41.260
<v Speaker 6>Did you see that movie?</v>

2742
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.680
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2743
01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:41.891
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2744
01:21:41.891 --> 01:21:42.371
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know.</v>

2745
01:21:42.371 --> 01:21:45.580
<v Speaker 6>That's the Tom Hanks one with Brad Pitt.</v>

2746
01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:47.650
<v Speaker 6>It's directed by the guy who did the,</v>

2747
01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:48.610
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2748
01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:50.070
<v Speaker 6>he's a very interesting directory.</v>

2749
01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:52.570
<v Speaker 6>Does like one movie every 10 years or something.</v>

2750
01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:53.800
<v Speaker 6>I can't remember his name right now.</v>

2751
01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.780
<v Speaker 6>This is not the interconnected lives.</v>

2752
01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:56.970
<v Speaker 6>What does well,</v>

2753
01:21:56.970 --> 01:21:57.180
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2754
01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:58.360
<v Speaker 6>that's the atlas.</v>

2755
01:21:58.361 --> 01:21:59.770
<v Speaker 6>The cloud atlas.</v>

2756
01:21:59.870 --> 01:22:00.041
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2757
01:22:00.041 --> 01:22:00.370
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

2758
01:22:00.370 --> 01:22:00.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2759
01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:00.860
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2760
01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:01.450
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2761
01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:01.661
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2762
01:22:01.661 --> 01:22:01.961
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

2763
01:22:01.961 --> 01:22:02.681
<v Speaker 6>this is like,</v>

2764
01:22:02.681 --> 01:22:04.480
<v Speaker 6>it is really trippy though.</v>

2765
01:22:04.481 --> 01:22:05.440
<v Speaker 6>It's like there's all this.</v>

2766
01:22:05.770 --> 01:22:07.330
<v Speaker 6>It'll have A.</v>

2767
01:22:07.330 --> 01:22:08.660
<v Speaker 6>Brad Pitt is a father,</v>

2768
01:22:08.661 --> 01:22:10.100
<v Speaker 6>a couple of kids.</v>

2769
01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.680
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure most of your listeners know what I'm talking about it.</v>

2770
01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.250
<v Speaker 6>He's a well known director.</v>

2771
01:22:15.490 --> 01:22:19.510
<v Speaker 6>He did a really funky movie about the Pacific Theater,</v>

2772
01:22:19.511 --> 01:22:22.000
<v Speaker 6>World War Two with Sean Penn in it.</v>

2773
01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:23.260
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2774
01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:23.590
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2775
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:24.423
<v Speaker 6>and um,</v>

2776
01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:25.750
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

2777
01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:27.670
<v Speaker 6>the guy from Saturday night fever,</v>

2778
01:22:27.730 --> 01:22:32.100
<v Speaker 6>a gay guy bathhouses dare you,</v>

2779
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:33.143
<v Speaker 6>the gay guy.</v>

2780
01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:35.200
<v Speaker 6>How about the amazing dancer,</v>

2781
01:22:35.690 --> 01:22:37.660
<v Speaker 6>like a really talented actor from pulp fiction</v>

2782
01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:45.330
<v Speaker 6>suck dick and nanosecond to know who is talking about.</v>

2783
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:47.380
<v Speaker 6>You were playing charades.</v>

2784
01:22:47.381 --> 01:22:48.214
<v Speaker 6>I would applaud.</v>

2785
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:50.561
<v Speaker 6>Anyway.</v>

2786
01:22:50.561 --> 01:22:51.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2787
01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:51.610
<v Speaker 6>So that was,</v>

2788
01:22:51.610 --> 01:22:53.920
<v Speaker 6>that seemed like a parody of that movie.</v>

2789
01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:54.720
<v Speaker 6>There it is,</v>

2790
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:59.720
<v Speaker 6>like the sun bursting and there's this real slow visuals and yeah,</v>

2791
01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.830
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the fucking motivation was,</v>

2792
01:23:02.831 --> 01:23:04.540
<v Speaker 6>but it's preposterous.</v>

2793
01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.580
<v Speaker 6>Just completely ridiculous commercial.</v>

2794
01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:09.610
<v Speaker 6>The idea behind the perfume itself,</v>

2795
01:23:09.611 --> 01:23:10.840
<v Speaker 6>it's very fascinating though.</v>

2796
01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:12.400
<v Speaker 6>I don't like it.</v>

2797
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:13.233
<v Speaker 6>I've never liked it.</v>

2798
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:17.080
<v Speaker 6>I don't mean there's like a couple like oils that girls can put on.</v>

2799
01:23:17.081 --> 01:23:18.430
<v Speaker 6>I think that smells kind of cool,</v>

2800
01:23:18.610 --> 01:23:20.770
<v Speaker 6>but generally I like the way people smell in a clean,</v>

2801
01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:21.340
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2802
01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:23.680
<v Speaker 6>and that's why perfume was invented.</v>

2803
01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:25.150
<v Speaker 6>People weren't fucking clean,</v>

2804
01:23:25.151 --> 01:23:25.984
<v Speaker 6>they were dirty,</v>

2805
01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:28.210
<v Speaker 6>stinking animals that we're scared of water.</v>

2806
01:23:28.930 --> 01:23:33.420
<v Speaker 6>And that's also why spices were so valuable during those centuries of the spice</v>

2807
01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:34.000
<v Speaker 6>spices.</v>

2808
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.870
<v Speaker 6>Pepper black pepper was worth more than because the food was rotting so they</v>

2809
01:23:37.871 --> 01:23:39.250
<v Speaker 6>would spice the shit up.</v>

2810
01:23:39.251 --> 01:23:40.150
<v Speaker 6>So you couldn't taste.</v>

2811
01:23:40.151 --> 01:23:45.151
<v Speaker 6>How horrible did a lot of people die from horrible digestive issues back then?</v>

2812
01:23:46.670 --> 01:23:46.880
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2813
01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:47.880
<v Speaker 6>well yeah.</v>

2814
01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:48.940
<v Speaker 6>In the medieval period,</v>

2815
01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:52.450
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people were dying from all sorts of nastiness related to the nastiness</v>

2816
01:23:52.451 --> 01:23:52.901
<v Speaker 6>of the food,</v>

2817
01:23:52.901 --> 01:23:56.080
<v Speaker 6>but also the fact that they were shitting in the street and there's no sewage</v>

2818
01:23:56.081 --> 01:23:56.914
<v Speaker 6>and everything.</v>

2819
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:58.030
<v Speaker 6>But what's interesting,</v>

2820
01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.360
<v Speaker 6>I think this is like cutting edge medical research.</v>

2821
01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:03.510
<v Speaker 6>Is that thing still playing in the background?</v>

2822
01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:04.600
<v Speaker 6>In the background there?</v>

2823
01:24:05.410 --> 01:24:05.560
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2824
01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.960
<v Speaker 6>I've heard it since the movie was on just now.</v>

2825
01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:12.700
<v Speaker 6>What is the for your ipad?</v>

2826
01:24:12.701 --> 01:24:13.990
<v Speaker 6>You Fuck Jesus.</v>

2827
01:24:13.991 --> 01:24:14.650
<v Speaker 6>Brian.</v>

2828
01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:17.410
<v Speaker 6>I thought I was going crazy again.</v>

2829
01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:19.110
<v Speaker 6>Uh Oh.</v>

2830
01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:22.430
<v Speaker 6>Is it cutting edge medical research I think is going to.</v>

2831
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:25.330
<v Speaker 6>You're probably tuned into this because of the body hacking and all that.</v>

2832
01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:25.650
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>

2833
01:24:25.650 --> 01:24:28.540
<v Speaker 6>the microflora of the stomach.</v>

2834
01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:29.130
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2835
01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:30.130
<v Speaker 6>Really interesting.</v>

2836
01:24:30.930 --> 01:24:34.120
<v Speaker 6>So in those days people would have had really robust,</v>

2837
01:24:34.450 --> 01:24:34.661
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2838
01:24:34.661 --> 01:24:36.940
<v Speaker 6>intestinal flora to deal with all that.</v>

2839
01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:41.530
<v Speaker 6>The bacteria that you're absorbing your system on a daily basis,</v>

2840
01:24:41.531 --> 01:24:46.531
<v Speaker 6>which dogs have supply dogs drink water and people who live in India.</v>

2841
01:24:46.631 --> 01:24:47.464
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

2842
01:24:47.710 --> 01:24:52.270
<v Speaker 6>I spent a lot of time and I went swimming in a fucking lake in India.</v>

2843
01:24:52.271 --> 01:24:53.120
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what I was.</v>

2844
01:24:53.170 --> 01:24:54.400
<v Speaker 6>Do not have the science channel.</v>

2845
01:24:55.150 --> 01:24:55.570
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2846
01:24:55.570 --> 01:24:56.500
<v Speaker 6>Do not have discovery.</v>

2847
01:24:56.501 --> 01:24:59.530
<v Speaker 6>Do you not watch those things where people come back with fucking football sized</v>

2848
01:24:59.531 --> 01:25:01.630
<v Speaker 6>parasites growing inside of their head do this,</v>

2849
01:25:01.631 --> 01:25:02.140
<v Speaker 6>was,</v>

2850
01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:03.860
<v Speaker 6>this was a long time ago and I,</v>

2851
01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.560
<v Speaker 6>I was young and invincible,</v>

2852
01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:06.970
<v Speaker 6>but a lot of stupid shit.</v>

2853
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.930
<v Speaker 6>Nothing.</v>

2854
01:25:07.930 --> 01:25:11.020
<v Speaker 6>You Got Lucky and I've been healthy as shit,</v>

2855
01:25:11.021 --> 01:25:11.291
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2856
01:25:11.291 --> 01:25:13.030
<v Speaker 6>I'm like the guy who never gets sick.</v>

2857
01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:14.021
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that's what it is.</v>

2858
01:25:14.021 --> 01:25:14.340
<v Speaker 6>I.</v>

2859
01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:14.550
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2860
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:15.850
<v Speaker 6>I think honestly,</v>

2861
01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:16.390
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2862
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:21.100
<v Speaker 6>when I was traveling a lot in Asia and Latin American stuff,</v>

2863
01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:25.090
<v Speaker 6>I took a lot of acidophilus and raw garlic.</v>

2864
01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:27.070
<v Speaker 6>Talk about body smells,</v>

2865
01:25:27.071 --> 01:25:27.311
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2866
01:25:27.311 --> 01:25:30.760
<v Speaker 6>I ate so much raw garlic and uh,</v>

2867
01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:32.740
<v Speaker 6>and the raw garlic is good.</v>

2868
01:25:32.741 --> 01:25:35.770
<v Speaker 6>It keeps him skeeto so away they don't like the smell of garlic and it comes out</v>

2869
01:25:35.771 --> 01:25:36.604
<v Speaker 6>through your skin.</v>

2870
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:38.320
<v Speaker 6>It keeps women away too.</v>

2871
01:25:38.321 --> 01:25:40.230
<v Speaker 6>I found I'm not Italian women.</v>

2872
01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:40.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2873
01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:42.660
<v Speaker 6>This is accepted Italian men.</v>

2874
01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:43.503
<v Speaker 6>Keep the Italian.</v>

2875
01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:46.510
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

2876
01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:46.931
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2877
01:25:46.931 --> 01:25:47.741
<v Speaker 6>And I say that,</v>

2878
01:25:47.741 --> 01:25:49.180
<v Speaker 6>but the ball show a different story.</v>

2879
01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:51.910
<v Speaker 6>Are we going to put our balls on the table?</v>

2880
01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:53.273
<v Speaker 6>Italian balls.</v>

2881
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:55.950
<v Speaker 6>The balls are large.</v>

2882
01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:57.073
<v Speaker 6>They're the director.</v>

2883
01:25:57.650 --> 01:25:59.280
<v Speaker 6>I think it's more of a species.</v>

2884
01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.850
<v Speaker 6>I mean there is some cultural,</v>

2885
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:03.740
<v Speaker 6>there is evidence that Asian balls are smaller.</v>

2886
01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:05.650
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2887
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:07.280
<v Speaker 6>I am started talking Spanish.</v>

2888
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:12.350
<v Speaker 6>They're quite a bit smaller than a black balls and white balls or somewhere in</v>

2889
01:26:12.801 --> 01:26:13.634
<v Speaker 6>the middle</v>

2890
01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.220
<v Speaker 6>being very sort of.</v>

2891
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:18.500
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if that's politically incorrect to say,</v>

2892
01:26:18.501 --> 01:26:19.070
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>

2893
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:20.240
<v Speaker 6>it seems to be true.</v>

2894
01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:21.980
<v Speaker 6>And my wife has,</v>

2895
01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:25.940
<v Speaker 6>I don't think I told you this story last time because Sylvia was here last time,</v>

2896
01:26:26.010 --> 01:26:26.843
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2897
01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.150
<v Speaker 6>couple of years into our relationship.</v>

2898
01:26:29.610 --> 01:26:29.880
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2899
01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:34.060
<v Speaker 6>one night we were hanging out with a friend in Barcelona smoking a joint and,</v>

2900
01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.021
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

2901
01:26:35.021 --> 01:26:35.750
<v Speaker 6>this friend,</v>

2902
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:36.890
<v Speaker 6>he's a funny guy,</v>

2903
01:26:36.891 --> 01:26:41.300
<v Speaker 6>he was giving me a hard time by giving her a hard time essentially.</v>

2904
01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:43.220
<v Speaker 6>And so he was saying about,</v>

2905
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:43.971
<v Speaker 6>Kyla,</v>

2906
01:26:43.971 --> 01:26:44.810
<v Speaker 6>you're so innocent,</v>

2907
01:26:44.811 --> 01:26:44.991
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2908
01:26:44.991 --> 01:26:48.410
<v Speaker 6>you were in medical school and then you were married all these years and you</v>

2909
01:26:48.411 --> 01:26:48.471
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

2910
01:26:48.471 --> 01:26:50.540
<v Speaker 6>you hook up with Chris when you're 40,</v>

2911
01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:51.891
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2912
01:26:51.891 --> 01:26:55.970
<v Speaker 6>you're just starting to see the world as Chris's corrupting you.</v>

2913
01:26:55.971 --> 01:26:56.750
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2914
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:57.583
<v Speaker 6>And he said,</v>

2915
01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:58.880
<v Speaker 6>you're so innocent,</v>

2916
01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:00.470
<v Speaker 6>you probably think Chris has a big Dick.</v>

2917
01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:01.761
<v Speaker 6>And she said,</v>

2918
01:27:01.761 --> 01:27:01.971
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2919
01:27:01.971 --> 01:27:02.331
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2920
01:27:02.331 --> 01:27:02.660
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2921
01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:04.850
<v Speaker 6>I've inspected a thousand penises.</v>

2922
01:27:05.210 --> 01:27:05.811
<v Speaker 6>And we were like,</v>

2923
01:27:05.811 --> 01:27:06.644
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2924
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.641
<v Speaker 6>she said,</v>

2925
01:27:07.641 --> 01:27:07.881
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2926
01:27:07.881 --> 01:27:11.180
<v Speaker 6>When I was doing that research for the World Health Organization in Africa,</v>

2927
01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:15.080
<v Speaker 6>I had to inspect the thousand penises and Vaginas.</v>

2928
01:27:16.330 --> 01:27:16.970
<v Speaker 6>It turns out.</v>

2929
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:17.241
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2930
01:27:17.241 --> 01:27:18.800
<v Speaker 6>I knew she had done this research,</v>

2931
01:27:18.801 --> 01:27:21.910
<v Speaker 6>but I didn't know it involved actually holding the Cox,</v>

2932
01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:22.760
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2933
01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:23.593
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2934
01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:25.370
<v Speaker 6>And so we loved to no gloves,</v>

2935
01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.420
<v Speaker 6>gloves,</v>

2936
01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:27.313
<v Speaker 6>gloves,</v>

2937
01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:29.870
<v Speaker 6>because account then sort of counts.</v>

2938
01:27:29.871 --> 01:27:30.704
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't matter me.</v>

2939
01:27:32.210 --> 01:27:34.670
<v Speaker 6>I mean if I were going to be uptight about shit like that,</v>

2940
01:27:34.671 --> 01:27:35.061
<v Speaker 6>believe me,</v>

2941
01:27:35.061 --> 01:27:36.320
<v Speaker 6>I'd be in a different business,</v>

2942
01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:37.580
<v Speaker 6>but a,</v>

2943
01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:39.110
<v Speaker 6>the funny thing was he was like,</v>

2944
01:27:39.111 --> 01:27:39.944
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

2945
01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:43.190
<v Speaker 6>she's hot and she was 27 or something at the time.</v>

2946
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.911
<v Speaker 6>And you're like,</v>

2947
01:27:43.911 --> 01:27:44.960
<v Speaker 6>what about erections?</v>

2948
01:27:44.961 --> 01:27:46.130
<v Speaker 6>And she just laughed and she said,</v>

2949
01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:46.611
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

2950
01:27:46.611 --> 01:27:47.510
<v Speaker 6>you just flick.</v>

2951
01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:51.980
<v Speaker 6>So Casella sort of like the anti fluffer she knows how to bring it down.</v>

2952
01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.850
<v Speaker 6>There's like you flick right under the head and the erection is gone</v>

2953
01:27:55.851 --> 01:27:56.630
<v Speaker 6>immediately.</v>

2954
01:27:56.630 --> 01:27:58.810
<v Speaker 6>Really try it when you get home.</v>

2955
01:27:58.830 --> 01:28:02.330
<v Speaker 6>Sounds annoying just to annoy the shit out of him.</v>

2956
01:28:02.331 --> 01:28:04.900
<v Speaker 6>But somewhere out there there's a guy that wouldn't stop me.</v>

2957
01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:07.040
<v Speaker 6>I like a little flicking.</v>

2958
01:28:08.210 --> 01:28:08.631
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2959
01:28:08.631 --> 01:28:08.871
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2960
01:28:08.871 --> 01:28:13.130
<v Speaker 6>so she can prove she's one of the rare individuals that seeing the broad</v>

2961
01:28:13.131 --> 01:28:14.240
<v Speaker 6>spectrum of the racist.</v>

2962
01:28:14.241 --> 01:28:15.074
<v Speaker 6>And she says,</v>

2963
01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:15.770
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2964
01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:17.060
<v Speaker 6>she seen a thousand Africans.</v>

2965
01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:17.840
<v Speaker 6>It's all apps.</v>

2966
01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:18.730
<v Speaker 6>That was all an hour.</v>

2967
01:28:18.731 --> 01:28:19.120
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2968
01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:20.390
<v Speaker 6>So it was all African people.</v>

2969
01:28:20.391 --> 01:28:22.490
<v Speaker 6>So it's a thousand Africans and me,</v>

2970
01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:23.890
<v Speaker 6>that's her,</v>

2971
01:28:23.890 --> 01:28:24.740
<v Speaker 6>her pool.</v>

2972
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:25.190
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

2973
01:28:25.190 --> 01:28:26.570
<v Speaker 6>she's not impressed.</v>

2974
01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:27.411
<v Speaker 6>I haven't asked.</v>

2975
01:28:27.411 --> 01:28:28.400
<v Speaker 6>I don't even ask.</v>

2976
01:28:29.190 --> 01:28:30.560
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to know the answer.</v>

2977
01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.333
<v Speaker 6>That's funny.</v>

2978
01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.280
<v Speaker 6>What a Douche bag friend you have,</v>

2979
01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:35.293
<v Speaker 6>by the way.</v>

2980
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:38.060
<v Speaker 6>I would cut that guy off just the way it communicates.</v>

2981
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:39.170
<v Speaker 6>Is he a dickhead?</v>

2982
01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:42.110
<v Speaker 6>He's a strange dude actually.</v>

2983
01:28:42.111 --> 01:28:45.140
<v Speaker 6>He's a jazz musician who went to,</v>

2984
01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:47.840
<v Speaker 6>grew up and went to college in Philadelphia at Temple,</v>

2985
01:28:48.170 --> 01:28:51.110
<v Speaker 6>which is 98 percent black and he's white.</v>

2986
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:52.760
<v Speaker 6>I'm Jewish.</v>

2987
01:28:52.761 --> 01:28:54.560
<v Speaker 6>He's like a hairy dark skin,</v>

2988
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:55.640
<v Speaker 6>Jewish guys,</v>

2989
01:28:55.641 --> 01:28:56.480
<v Speaker 6>big tall guy.</v>

2990
01:28:57.290 --> 01:29:02.290
<v Speaker 6>And he talks like an inner city Philadelphia black dude and he sounds wonderful,</v>

2991
01:29:06.010 --> 01:29:06.490
<v Speaker 6>but he,</v>

2992
01:29:06.490 --> 01:29:07.400
<v Speaker 6>he's not doing it.</v>

2993
01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:08.370
<v Speaker 6>He's not racist.</v>

2994
01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:09.030
<v Speaker 6>Like he just,</v>

2995
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:10.450
<v Speaker 6>he grew up with these guys and,</v>

2996
01:29:10.451 --> 01:29:11.281
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

2997
01:29:11.281 --> 01:29:14.280
<v Speaker 6>you learn to sort of communicate the way your community communicate.</v>

2998
01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:17.640
<v Speaker 6>But it could be awkward because he would,</v>

2999
01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:18.503
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3000
01:29:18.670 --> 01:29:22.020
<v Speaker 6>as much as he would use the n word liberally.</v>

3001
01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:22.920
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

3002
01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:23.670
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3003
01:29:23.670 --> 01:29:26.550
<v Speaker 6>Among like a white crowd or,</v>

3004
01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:28.950
<v Speaker 6>and with his black friends who knew him,</v>

3005
01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:33.750
<v Speaker 6>but then it would get weird if we were at a party or something and he'd be like,</v>

3006
01:29:33.751 --> 01:29:34.070
<v Speaker 6>Yo,</v>

3007
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:36.450
<v Speaker 6>mom was like a fucking idiot.</v>

3008
01:29:36.451 --> 01:29:38.720
<v Speaker 6>What are you hanging out with this guy for a long time?</v>

3009
01:29:38.730 --> 01:29:39.490
<v Speaker 6>Making fun of you</v>

3010
01:29:39.490 --> 01:29:42.700
<v Speaker 5>for having a regular size to your wife.</v>

3011
01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:43.091
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

3012
01:29:43.091 --> 01:29:45.220
<v Speaker 5>Did douchebag dropping bombs.</v>

3013
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.641
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3014
01:29:45.641 --> 01:29:46.550
<v Speaker 5>bring them to my parties.</v>

3015
01:29:46.570 --> 01:29:47.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3016
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:48.160
<v Speaker 5>sounds like a treat.</v>

3017
01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:51.880
<v Speaker 5>He knows I love white guys who talk black to.</v>

3018
01:29:51.881 --> 01:29:52.151
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3019
01:29:52.151 --> 01:29:53.300
<v Speaker 5>one of my favorite things.</v>

3020
01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:55.180
<v Speaker 5>Can't get enough of them in my life.</v>

3021
01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.220
<v Speaker 5>That's what you really want to go to.</v>

3022
01:29:57.221 --> 01:29:58.810
<v Speaker 5>If you're really confused about the world.</v>

3023
01:29:58.840 --> 01:29:59.940
<v Speaker 5>He needs a confidant.</v>

3024
01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:00.400
<v Speaker 5>Need someone?</v>

3025
01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:00.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3026
01:30:00.490 --> 01:30:02.350
<v Speaker 5>You to go to a white guy who talks black.</v>

3027
01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.273
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3028
01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:04.870
<v Speaker 6>but I mean it happens.</v>

3029
01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:05.321
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

3030
01:30:05.321 --> 01:30:08.920
<v Speaker 6>look at all these kids with their pants hanging down around their asses and</v>

3031
01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:11.530
<v Speaker 6>showing gang signs and you know,</v>

3032
01:30:11.650 --> 01:30:13.480
<v Speaker 6>flicker photos and what are you doing?</v>

3033
01:30:13.570 --> 01:30:14.403
<v Speaker 6>That pants</v>

3034
01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:15.650
<v Speaker 5>hanging around your.</v>

3035
01:30:15.651 --> 01:30:17.240
<v Speaker 5>Your ass means one thing.</v>

3036
01:30:17.241 --> 01:30:22.241
<v Speaker 5>You don't know how to check leg kicks because I guarantee you one more tie at</v>

3037
01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:23.031
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>

3038
01:30:23.031 --> 01:30:24.790
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't have your fucking pants hamper.</v>

3039
01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:27.140
<v Speaker 5>Your someone who's just going to kick your legs.</v>

3040
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:28.400
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing you can do about it.</v>

3041
01:30:28.401 --> 01:30:29.730
<v Speaker 5>Your buckles over your Dick.</v>

3042
01:30:29.731 --> 01:30:30.680
<v Speaker 5>He can't move your hips.</v>

3043
01:30:30.690 --> 01:30:31.260
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3044
01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:32.100
<v Speaker 6>Going to get into,</v>

3045
01:30:32.130 --> 01:30:34.130
<v Speaker 6>what did you say?</v>

3046
01:30:34.410 --> 01:30:37.340
<v Speaker 6>Look at those kids with their baggy pants and their liquor photos,</v>

3047
01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:45.680
<v Speaker 6>the gang signs and their flicker for the gang signs in their flicker,</v>

3048
01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:47.480
<v Speaker 6>flicker.</v>

3049
01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:51.420
<v Speaker 6>They really put the gang signs online and you see these kids from Pacific</v>

3050
01:30:51.421 --> 01:30:52.254
<v Speaker 6>palisades.</v>

3051
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:53.783
<v Speaker 6>It's like</v>

3052
01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:56.220
<v Speaker 6>there is an issue with that.</v>

3053
01:30:56.220 --> 01:31:00.060
<v Speaker 5>Those kids that grow up in those really rich places where they want to</v>

3054
01:31:00.061 --> 01:31:04.380
<v Speaker 5>overcompensate because of the fact that their parents are so not street and they</v>

3055
01:31:04.381 --> 01:31:07.380
<v Speaker 5>get like inner mixed with inner city kids.</v>

3056
01:31:07.381 --> 01:31:10.710
<v Speaker 5>They get shipped there and then they want to prove their worth and I actually</v>

3057
01:31:11.070 --> 01:31:13.570
<v Speaker 5>had a friend who had a kid who went to a,</v>

3058
01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:17.140
<v Speaker 5>one of those Pacific Pacific palisades or Malibu,</v>

3059
01:31:17.150 --> 01:31:19.230
<v Speaker 5>but one of those high schools and he's like,</v>

3060
01:31:19.231 --> 01:31:21.510
<v Speaker 5>you'd be fucking amazing how bad it was.</v>

3061
01:31:21.511 --> 01:31:24.570
<v Speaker 5>They had to pull the kid out of there because there's constant drugs and</v>

3062
01:31:24.571 --> 01:31:29.460
<v Speaker 5>violence and chaos and craziness and the all a massive amount of kids in those</v>

3063
01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:30.900
<v Speaker 5>areas that grow up.</v>

3064
01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:31.530
<v Speaker 5>And I.</v>

3065
01:31:31.530 --> 01:31:32.880
<v Speaker 5>It kind of makes sense if you think about it,</v>

3066
01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:35.160
<v Speaker 5>is people that have a fuckload of money,</v>

3067
01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:37.170
<v Speaker 5>a lot of them also,</v>

3068
01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:41.660
<v Speaker 5>they have issues with pills where they have pills at home or um,</v>

3069
01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:42.190
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

3070
01:31:42.190 --> 01:31:44.300
<v Speaker 5>there's a shallow sort of,</v>

3071
01:31:44.301 --> 01:31:44.550
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3072
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:47.920
<v Speaker 5>materialistic vibe to the family and uh,</v>

3073
01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:48.591
<v Speaker 5>it gets,</v>

3074
01:31:48.591 --> 01:31:52.530
<v Speaker 5>it gets distributed to the kids and then the kids start doing a lot of pills.</v>

3075
01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:55.530
<v Speaker 5>It's like it was Malibu or one of those high schools.</v>

3076
01:31:55.531 --> 01:31:56.670
<v Speaker 5>I can't really wish I could remember,</v>

3077
01:31:56.671 --> 01:31:57.980
<v Speaker 5>but they were snorting oxies.</v>

3078
01:31:58.170 --> 01:31:59.320
<v Speaker 5>It was like a big issue.</v>

3079
01:31:59.950 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 5>You</v>

3080
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.490
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

3081
01:32:00.490 --> 01:32:02.140
<v Speaker 4>I've heard about that in thousand oaks too,</v>

3082
01:32:02.141 --> 01:32:04.480
<v Speaker 4>that they have a problem with the girls.</v>

3083
01:32:04.481 --> 01:32:08.410
<v Speaker 4>Dylan has been quite a few girls that have gotten in trouble for doing</v>

3084
01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:09.460
<v Speaker 4>oxycontin's.</v>

3085
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:14.140
<v Speaker 4>They're doing heroin and they're doing it in high school and these are really</v>

3086
01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:15.460
<v Speaker 4>wealthy neighborhoods,</v>

3087
01:32:15.461 --> 01:32:16.420
<v Speaker 4>wealthy areas.</v>

3088
01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:19.600
<v Speaker 4>But these people probably never around for their fucking kids.</v>

3089
01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:22.390
<v Speaker 4>And if you've got enough money to buy $9,000,000 house,</v>

3090
01:32:22.391 --> 01:32:23.500
<v Speaker 4>you work your Dick off,</v>

3091
01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:24.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3092
01:32:24.010 --> 01:32:25.780
<v Speaker 4>you probably are not around that much.</v>

3093
01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:26.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3094
01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't see how kids are raised by Nannies.</v>

3095
01:32:28.530 --> 01:32:29.363
<v Speaker 4>Many cases.</v>

3096
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.461
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3097
01:32:30.461 --> 01:32:35.461
<v Speaker 4>Especially in those dual career household when your wife works her ass off as</v>

3098
01:32:36.221 --> 01:32:36.940
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3099
01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:40.300
<v Speaker 4>you're both working your ass off all day and then you're trying to become</v>

3100
01:32:40.301 --> 01:32:42.820
<v Speaker 4>parents at night and it's a fucking grind.</v>

3101
01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:44.560
<v Speaker 4>That's a hard grind.</v>

3102
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:45.161
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3103
01:32:45.161 --> 01:32:46.450
<v Speaker 4>if you leased a lot of poor people,</v>

3104
01:32:46.451 --> 01:32:48.160
<v Speaker 4>they involve their families in that grind,</v>

3105
01:32:48.190 --> 01:32:48.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3106
01:32:48.370 --> 01:32:50.160
<v Speaker 4>they bring in the grandmother or you know,</v>

3107
01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:53.440
<v Speaker 4>they live in a neighborhood where a lot of family members nearby and they can</v>

3108
01:32:53.441 --> 01:32:56.140
<v Speaker 4>sort of take turns taking care of all the children together,</v>

3109
01:32:56.290 --> 01:33:00.010
<v Speaker 4>which actually turned out to be healthier as long as it's not a high crime area</v>

3110
01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:00.470
<v Speaker 4>on that.</v>

3111
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:02.560
<v Speaker 4>See that relates back to three history.</v>

3112
01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:03.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3113
01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:03.610
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3114
01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:07.510
<v Speaker 4>this whole idea and Kasota grew up in Mozambique and she talked about like,</v>

3115
01:33:07.530 --> 01:33:07.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3116
01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:10.240
<v Speaker 4>at night and nobody worried about where you were.</v>

3117
01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:12.460
<v Speaker 4>Your parents didn't worry about where you are wherever you were.</v>

3118
01:33:12.461 --> 01:33:13.540
<v Speaker 4>Somebody there are some adults,</v>

3119
01:33:13.541 --> 01:33:15.060
<v Speaker 4>they're taking care of you being cool,</v>

3120
01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:15.903
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3121
01:33:16.010 --> 01:33:19.330
<v Speaker 4>you could eat dinner at somebody else's house and come home later or sleep</v>

3122
01:33:19.331 --> 01:33:19.541
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

3123
01:33:19.541 --> 01:33:20.890
<v Speaker 4>You look for like whatever.</v>

3124
01:33:20.891 --> 01:33:21.401
<v Speaker 4>It sounds.</v>

3125
01:33:21.401 --> 01:33:22.000
<v Speaker 4>So unity,</v>

3126
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:22.900
<v Speaker 4>Utopian.</v>

3127
01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:23.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3128
01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:24.431
<v Speaker 4>But yet,</v>

3129
01:33:24.431 --> 01:33:26.440
<v Speaker 4>not because nobody wants to live in Mozambique,</v>

3130
01:33:26.770 --> 01:33:27.251
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3131
01:33:27.251 --> 01:33:28.680
<v Speaker 4>no one here happened in math.</v>

3132
01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:29.501
<v Speaker 4>You say that,</v>

3133
01:33:29.501 --> 01:33:29.891
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3134
01:33:29.891 --> 01:33:32.440
<v Speaker 4>but it's the Brazil in Beverly Hills and say,</v>

3135
01:33:32.441 --> 01:33:32.950
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3136
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:34.390
<v Speaker 4>who wants to go to Mozambique?</v>

3137
01:33:34.730 --> 01:33:35.230
<v Speaker 4>They going to go,</v>

3138
01:33:35.230 --> 01:33:35.531
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>

3139
01:33:35.531 --> 01:33:36.364
<v Speaker 4>are you crazy?</v>

3140
01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:38.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to move to Mozambique.</v>

3146
01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:46.910
<v Speaker 4>Are you fucking crazy?</v>

3147
01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:49.180
<v Speaker 4>No one's gonna believe that's the truth,</v>

3148
01:33:49.181 --> 01:33:49.480
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3149
01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:50.470
<v Speaker 4>So what is it like you said,</v>

3150
01:33:50.471 --> 01:33:51.370
<v Speaker 4>it's like the Brazil.</v>

3151
01:33:51.371 --> 01:33:52.540
<v Speaker 4>I haven't been to Mozambique.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm talking shit.</v>

3154
01:33:54.161 --> 01:33:59.080
<v Speaker 4>But my wife grew up there so I hear a lot about it and she was just there a</v>

3155
01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:00.020
<v Speaker 4>couple months ago and she said,</v>

3156
01:34:00.021 --> 01:34:02.170
<v Speaker 4>and it's like eight percent economic growth.</v>

3157
01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:06.460
<v Speaker 4>It's Africa is booming right now because the Chinese are buying up all the</v>

3158
01:34:06.461 --> 01:34:08.830
<v Speaker 4>natural resources that buying up land.</v>

01:34:08.831 --> 01:34:09.664
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3160
01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:10.630
<v Speaker 4>it's happening.</v>

01:34:16.631 --> 01:34:17.200
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

3167
01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.630
<v Speaker 4>it's like a pretty raw,</v>

3168
01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:21.430
<v Speaker 4>beautiful spot on earth.</v>

01:34:23.770 --> 01:34:25.320
<v Speaker 4>Africa is a trip you fucking place,</v>

3173
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.840
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3174
01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:29.050
<v Speaker 4>The idea of leaving the kids just wandering around and Africa are two lions and</v>

3175
01:34:29.051 --> 01:34:29.884
<v Speaker 4>Mozambique.</v>

3176
01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:30.281
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3177
01:34:30.281 --> 01:34:30.641

3179
01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:32.800
<v Speaker 4>She had a German shepherd</v>

3180
01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:38.620
<v Speaker 4>who got that got eaten by a lion when she was a kid.</v>

3181
01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.070
<v Speaker 4>Rice.</v>

3182
01:34:40.830 --> 01:34:41.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3183
01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:45.200
<v Speaker 4>Mountain lions are scary lions way scarier than mountain lion.</v>

3184
01:34:45.730 --> 01:34:47.230
<v Speaker 4>Nobody gets away from the lines.</v>

3185
01:34:47.231 --> 01:34:49.390
<v Speaker 4>But you know what kills most people in Africa?</v>

3186
01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:52.560
<v Speaker 4>Hippo fucking ants over.</v>

3187
01:34:52.561 --> 01:34:54.670
<v Speaker 4>Really answer a motherfucker.</v>

3188
01:34:54.671 --> 01:34:55.530
<v Speaker 4>That's not a good way to.</v>

3189
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:57.501
<v Speaker 4>There's video.</v>

3190
01:34:57.501 --> 01:35:01.880
<v Speaker 4>I saw once of ants eating an elephant and they were going up the elephant's leg</v>

3191
01:35:01.881 --> 01:35:02.780
<v Speaker 4>into its ear.</v>

3192
01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:03.770
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

3193
01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:06.020
<v Speaker 4>And they were essentially attacking this elephant,</v>

3194
01:35:06.050 --> 01:35:07.340
<v Speaker 4>eating an ear first,</v>

3195
01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:09.110
<v Speaker 4>just going right through the ear.</v>

3196
01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:11.840
<v Speaker 4>And there wasn't a Goddamn thing the elephant can do to stop it.</v>

3197
01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:12.880
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>

3198
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:15.680
<v Speaker 4>that's not in Alaska.</v>

3199
01:35:15.681 --> 01:35:17.070
<v Speaker 4>You get that with mosquito.</v>

3200
01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:17.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3201
01:35:17.961 --> 01:35:20.790
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that on a horrible.</v>

3202
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:22.130
<v Speaker 4>I've never experienced it live,</v>

3203
01:35:22.131 --> 01:35:23.180
<v Speaker 4>but I've watched those,</v>

3204
01:35:23.181 --> 01:35:23.720
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3205
01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:26.390
<v Speaker 4>those Alaska sustenance shows those.</v>

3206
01:35:26.391 --> 01:35:26.870
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3207
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:27.830
<v Speaker 4>have you ever seen those shows?</v>

3208
01:35:27.870 --> 01:35:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Saw one or two.</v>

3209
01:35:29.201 --> 01:35:29.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3210
01:35:29.591 --> 01:35:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Where they put these like a reality.</v>

3211
01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:31.960
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3212
01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:32.200
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3213
01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:32.341
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3214
01:35:32.341 --> 01:35:32.461
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3215
01:35:32.461 --> 01:35:32.551
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3216
01:35:32.551 --> 01:35:32.741
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3217
01:35:32.741 --> 01:35:34.690
<v Speaker 4>These are actually people that live there.</v>

3218
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:36.000
<v Speaker 4>They're uh,</v>

3219
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.390
<v Speaker 4>they're these people that.</v>

3220
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:39.370
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of different ones.</v>

3221
01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:43.710
<v Speaker 4>There's one of them's called Yukon man and the other one's called Alaska,</v>

3222
01:35:43.711 --> 01:35:44.950
<v Speaker 4>the last frontier and,</v>

3223
01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:49.240
<v Speaker 4>and they're essentially these people that live in these very small hunting</v>

3224
01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:49.990
<v Speaker 4>communities,</v>

3225
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:51.370
<v Speaker 4>hunting fishing communities,</v>

3226
01:35:51.670 --> 01:35:56.200
<v Speaker 4>and they make no income other than furs that they occasionally get and they have</v>

3227
01:35:56.201 --> 01:36:00.220
<v Speaker 4>three months of summer where they're all just frantically trying to gather up</v>

3228
01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:02.980
<v Speaker 4>resources and then they locked down for seven,</v>

3229
01:36:02.981 --> 01:36:03.191
<v Speaker 4>eight,</v>

3230
01:36:03.191 --> 01:36:04.024
<v Speaker 4>nine months.</v>

3231
01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.100
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy to watch.</v>

3232
01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:08.050
<v Speaker 4>And these people in the summertime,</v>

3233
01:36:08.051 --> 01:36:11.530
<v Speaker 4>they're dealing with fucking swarms of mosquitoes,</v>

3234
01:36:11.531 --> 01:36:13.330
<v Speaker 4>like aggressive,</v>

3235
01:36:13.630 --> 01:36:15.090
<v Speaker 4>desperate mosquitoes.</v>

3236
01:36:15.091 --> 01:36:18.670
<v Speaker 4>They're like an inch across and they know they only have a couple of months so</v>

3237
01:36:18.671 --> 01:36:19.510
<v Speaker 4>they just go for it.</v>

3238
01:36:20.130 --> 01:36:20.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3239
01:36:20.551 --> 01:36:21.570
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

3240
01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:23.250
<v Speaker 2>you know when the dusk,</v>

3241
01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:26.070
<v Speaker 2>when the mosquitoes come out and you can see a swarm,</v>

3242
01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:28.380
<v Speaker 2>you're setting up your tent,</v>

3243
01:36:28.410 --> 01:36:28.801
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3244
01:36:28.801 --> 01:36:29.581
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

3245
01:36:29.581 --> 01:36:34.581
<v Speaker 2>I remember setting up my tent and like every second moving my shirts so they</v>

3246
01:36:35.041 --> 01:36:36.690
<v Speaker 2>couldn't get in through the shirt,</v>

3247
01:36:36.691 --> 01:36:36.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3248
01:36:36.901 --> 01:36:38.860
<v Speaker 2>I had to keep moving the shirt while I'm setting up the tent.</v>

3249
01:36:38.861 --> 01:36:40.860
<v Speaker 2>And then you get in there and you can hear.</v>

3250
01:36:40.890 --> 01:36:43.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like hail banging against the side of the tenant.</v>

3251
01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.480
<v Speaker 2>You can hear them banging on the tent.</v>

3252
01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:46.381
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3253
01:36:46.381 --> 01:36:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3254
01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:47.473
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

3255
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:48.630
<v Speaker 2>they're little helicopter.</v>

3256
01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:50.760
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck did people do before they figured out tense?</v>

3257
01:36:51.570 --> 01:36:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3258
01:36:52.501 --> 01:36:53.430
<v Speaker 2>well the Eskimos,</v>

3259
01:36:53.431 --> 01:36:57.390
<v Speaker 2>I believe that they smeared fat on their skin that would,</v>

3260
01:36:57.450 --> 01:37:00.990
<v Speaker 2>certain kinds of fat would keep the mosquitoes off them and they've got all</v>

3261
01:37:00.991 --> 01:37:03.930
<v Speaker 2>sorts of really clever adaptations,</v>

3262
01:37:03.931 --> 01:37:04.764
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3263
01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:05.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3264
01:37:05.221 --> 01:37:05.401
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3265
01:37:05.401 --> 01:37:08.010
<v Speaker 2>we sort of assume that we would be helpless,</v>

3266
01:37:08.011 --> 01:37:11.430
<v Speaker 2>but that's because we didn't grow up there and our culture didn't,</v>

3267
01:37:11.431 --> 01:37:12.220
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3268
01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:13.053
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

3269
01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:14.930
<v Speaker 2>you know who Wade Davis is a,</v>

3270
01:37:14.970 --> 01:37:15.420
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

3271
01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:16.950
<v Speaker 2>he's an anthropologist.</v>

3272
01:37:16.951 --> 01:37:17.910
<v Speaker 2>He's written a bunch of books.</v>

3273
01:37:17.911 --> 01:37:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting guy.</v>

3274
01:37:18.901 --> 01:37:23.901
<v Speaker 2>He's like anthropologists in residence at the Smithsonian in Washington.</v>

3275
01:37:24.690 --> 01:37:27.660
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a book called the wayfarers I think was his last book about</v>

3276
01:37:27.690 --> 01:37:28.523
<v Speaker 2>traditional,</v>

3277
01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:28.921
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3278
01:37:28.921 --> 01:37:31.800
<v Speaker 2>about how these guys could navigate across the Pacific,</v>

3279
01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:36.330
<v Speaker 2>just looking at the stars and the color of the water and smelling and whatever</v>

3280
01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:37.193
<v Speaker 2>they'd.</v>

3281
01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:37.831
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

3282
01:37:37.831 --> 01:37:38.191
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3283
01:37:38.191 --> 01:37:38.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3284
01:37:38.490 --> 01:37:40.650
<v Speaker 2>one of the stories he tells us about this,</v>

3285
01:37:41.010 --> 01:37:41.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3286
01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Eskimo guy,</v>

3287
01:37:43.230 --> 01:37:47.640
<v Speaker 2>old guy and the family sort of took the keys to the car away from him.</v>

3288
01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:49.250
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't go anymore.</v>

3289
01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:54.090
<v Speaker 2>They were afraid he would go out and die the traditional way when Eskimo people</v>

3290
01:37:54.091 --> 01:37:54.750
<v Speaker 2>got old,</v>

3291
01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:57.180
<v Speaker 2>they would like wander off into the ice and die.</v>

3292
01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:59.430
<v Speaker 2>So as not to be a burden to the family.</v>

3293
01:37:59.490 --> 01:38:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3294
01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:04.470
<v Speaker 2>And he was a traditional guy and they were worried that he would take the snow</v>

3295
01:38:04.471 --> 01:38:07.800
<v Speaker 2>machine out and just die out there somewhere or hurt himself hunting or</v>

3296
01:38:07.801 --> 01:38:08.634
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3297
01:38:08.730 --> 01:38:12.000
<v Speaker 2>So they had this whole intervention.</v>

3298
01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:14.790
<v Speaker 2>And so that night he goes out,</v>

3299
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:16.320
<v Speaker 2>gets out of the house,</v>

3300
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:18.840
<v Speaker 2>takes a shit in his hand,</v>

3301
01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:21.750
<v Speaker 2>forms the shit into a knife,</v>

3302
01:38:21.751 --> 01:38:26.751
<v Speaker 2>blade spits on it and the spit is freezing along the edge and he hones that</v>

3303
01:38:29.701 --> 01:38:29.941
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

3304
01:38:29.941 --> 01:38:32.400
<v Speaker 2>So he gets a nice sharp edge with his sped,</v>

3305
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:34.800
<v Speaker 2>takes his shit knife,</v>

3306
01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:40.160
<v Speaker 2>kills a dog or a couple of dogs and takes their ribs and makes us a sled out of</v>

3307
01:38:42.301 --> 01:38:42.960
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3308
01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:46.050
<v Speaker 2>And with the sinews and whatever other pieces of the dogs,</v>

3309
01:38:46.051 --> 01:38:46.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3310
01:38:46.231 --> 01:38:48.060
<v Speaker 2>he knew all this stuff from his childhood,</v>

3311
01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:51.970
<v Speaker 2>hooks up a couple of other dogs to the sled and he takes off into this,</v>

3312
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:53.940
<v Speaker 2>into the snow on his,</v>

3313
01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:55.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3314
01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:56.880
<v Speaker 2>sled with his shit knife.</v>

3315
01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:57.773
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3316
01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:00.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3317
01:39:00.511 --> 01:39:02.820
<v Speaker 2>That might be the most of the same story I've ever heard.</v>

3318
01:39:02.821 --> 01:39:03.780
<v Speaker 2>And they're so clever.</v>

3319
01:39:03.781 --> 01:39:05.280
<v Speaker 2>You know how they killed polar bears.</v>

3320
01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:08.250
<v Speaker 2>I know they take blood and put it on a blade.</v>

3321
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:09.430
<v Speaker 2>I know that method.</v>

3322
01:39:09.450 --> 01:39:10.440
<v Speaker 2>That was actually wolves.</v>

3323
01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:14.970
<v Speaker 2>The wolves would lick the blade and uh,</v>

3324
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:15.271
<v Speaker 2>we would,</v>

3325
01:39:15.271 --> 01:39:15.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3326
01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:17.040
<v Speaker 2>they would cut themselves to death,</v>

3327
01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.360
<v Speaker 2>similar kind of thing.</v>

3328
01:39:18.361 --> 01:39:20.130
<v Speaker 2>What they would do is they take a little,</v>

3329
01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:23.940
<v Speaker 2>they'd make a wooden box and they would take a seal,</v>

3330
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.670
<v Speaker 2>a rib and sharpen the two ends of the seal rib.</v>

3331
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:28.060
<v Speaker 2>And they're pretty flexible.</v>

3332
01:39:28.110 --> 01:39:30.090
<v Speaker 2>They bend it and stick it into the box,</v>

3333
01:39:30.091 --> 01:39:30.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3334
01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:35.650
<v Speaker 2>And then they'd pour melted fat into the box and let it solidify freeze and then</v>

3335
01:39:35.651 --> 01:39:36.510
<v Speaker 2>they knock it out.</v>

3336
01:39:36.511 --> 01:39:41.511
<v Speaker 2>So you've got a fat cube with this flexed to bladed thing inside it.</v>

3337
01:39:42.061 --> 01:39:43.170
<v Speaker 2>And they leave that in the snow.</v>

3338
01:39:43.170 --> 01:39:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Polar bear come along,</v>

3339
01:39:44.131 --> 01:39:44.791
<v Speaker 2>swallow it,</v>

3340
01:39:44.791 --> 01:39:46.800
<v Speaker 2>and opens in the polar bear.</v>

3341
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:47.491
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3342
01:39:47.491 --> 01:39:50.010
<v Speaker 2>And they just follow the blood drops and it would kill them.</v>

3343
01:39:50.130 --> 01:39:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3344
01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Because internal hemorrhaging.</v>

3345
01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:53.880
<v Speaker 2>How long did it take to kill him?</v>

3346
01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:54.733
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>

3347
01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:56.610
<v Speaker 2>I just remember that.</v>

3348
01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:57.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3349
01:39:57.330 --> 01:39:58.710
<v Speaker 2>there are stories like that all over the world.</v>

3350
01:39:58.711 --> 01:39:58.891
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3351
01:39:58.891 --> 01:40:00.150
<v Speaker 2>the Indian monkey trap,</v>

3352
01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:01.160
<v Speaker 2>the East Indian monkey.</v>

3353
01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:02.013
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3354
01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:07.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how interested your readers or your listeners that system is.</v>

3355
01:40:07.171 --> 01:40:08.630
<v Speaker 2>And this is a good metaphor to.</v>

3356
01:40:08.631 --> 01:40:09.600
<v Speaker 2>I always remember this one.</v>

3357
01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:11.160
<v Speaker 2>They would take,</v>

3358
01:40:11.161 --> 01:40:11.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3359
01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:12.271
<v Speaker 2>same thing,</v>

3360
01:40:12.271 --> 01:40:17.271
<v Speaker 2>take a box with a hole about a little smaller than a fist in the Mug,</v>

3361
01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:20.880
<v Speaker 2>in the box.</v>

3362
01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:25.440
<v Speaker 2>And they put a mango in the box and then hammer it shot and tight to a tree.</v>

3363
01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:27.300
<v Speaker 2>So the mango starts rotting,</v>

3364
01:40:27.301 --> 01:40:28.300
<v Speaker 2>the monkey smells it.</v>

3365
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:29.131
<v Speaker 2>Monkey comes along,</v>

3366
01:40:29.131 --> 01:40:32.100
<v Speaker 2>can stick his hand in and feel the mango,</v>

3367
01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:36.720
<v Speaker 2>but he can't get his hand out as long as he's holding onto the mango and they</v>

3368
01:40:36.721 --> 01:40:38.010
<v Speaker 2>won't let go of the mango.</v>

3369
01:40:38.370 --> 01:40:40.680
<v Speaker 2>All they have to do is let go and they could leave,</v>

3370
01:40:40.681 --> 01:40:43.650
<v Speaker 2>but they've got the mango in their hands and they won't let go.</v>

3371
01:40:44.130 --> 01:40:46.050
<v Speaker 2>And so the guy comes around to check the traps.</v>

3372
01:40:46.051 --> 01:40:48.270
<v Speaker 2>There's the monkey standing there with his hand in the box.</v>

3373
01:40:48.271 --> 01:40:48.961
<v Speaker 2>Hit It on the head.</v>

3374
01:40:48.961 --> 01:40:49.794
<v Speaker 2>You got your monkey.</v>

3375
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

3376
01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:52.710
<v Speaker 2>So it was something about greed there.</v>

3377
01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:55.810
<v Speaker 4>That's an awesome story.</v>

3378
01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:57.630
<v Speaker 4>That is a perfect metaphor to.</v>

3379
01:40:57.690 --> 01:40:58.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3380
01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:59.200
<v Speaker 4>that's amazing.</v>

3381
01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:00.191
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3382
01:41:00.191 --> 01:41:01.210
<v Speaker 4>Let go of the mango.</v>

3383
01:41:01.211 --> 01:41:02.140
<v Speaker 4>That's my advice.</v>

3384
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:02.621
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3385
01:41:02.621 --> 01:41:03.340
<v Speaker 4>that's a good.</v>

3386
01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:04.240
<v Speaker 4>That should be a t shirt.</v>

3387
01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:06.760
<v Speaker 4>Not a bumper sticker.</v>

3388
01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:08.740
<v Speaker 4>A bumper sticker.</v>

3389
01:41:08.741 --> 01:41:10.750
<v Speaker 4>Bad showed good shit.</v>

3390
01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:11.890
<v Speaker 4>It's a better bumper.</v>

3391
01:41:11.891 --> 01:41:12.611
<v Speaker 4>He said Shit.</v>

3392
01:41:12.611 --> 01:41:14.500
<v Speaker 4>Knife is a crazy story.</v>

3393
01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.620
<v Speaker 4>The guy killed a dog with a frozen piece of shit.</v>

3394
01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:19.780
<v Speaker 4>How stupid was that?</v>

3395
01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:20.623
<v Speaker 4>Dog</v>

3396
01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:23.890
<v Speaker 4>was sleeping there.</v>

3397
01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:24.671
<v Speaker 4>This guy came up,</v>

3398
01:41:24.671 --> 01:41:25.120

<v Speaker 4>Where you at?</v>

3404
01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:33.390
<v Speaker 4>Where are you going to talk people into shitting in their hand or stuff like</v>

3405
01:41:33.410 --> 01:41:33.670
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3406
01:41:33.670 --> 01:41:35.140
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't that one of your,</v>

3407
01:41:35.141 --> 01:41:35.974
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3408
01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:37.110
<v Speaker 4>I forgot I did.</v>

3409
01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.140
<v Speaker 4>I talked to you about this.</v>

3410
01:41:38.530 --> 01:41:39.001
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3411
01:41:39.001 --> 01:41:39.460
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3412
01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:40.290
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3413
01:41:40.290 --> 01:41:41.410
<v Speaker 4>I believe you talked to Duncan.</v>

3414
01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:42.530
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3415
01:41:42.530 --> 01:41:43.070
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

3416
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.903
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3417
01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:45.860
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about um,</v>

3418
01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:48.820
<v Speaker 4>about wiping,</v>

3419
01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:54.210
<v Speaker 4>wiping yourself and about how weird it is that we sort of like smudge tissue</v>

3420
01:41:54.221 --> 01:41:56.110
<v Speaker 4>over our assholes after we shit.</v>

3421
01:41:56.140 --> 01:42:00.220
<v Speaker 4>And then in other countries that we consider these people to be savage,</v>

3422
01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:02.020
<v Speaker 4>they wash their hand,</v>

3423
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3424
01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:05.170
<v Speaker 4>and they wash their ass with their hand and water and we'd like that.</v>

3425
01:42:05.171 --> 01:42:06.640
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking crazy.</v>

3426
01:42:06.641 --> 01:42:07.121
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3427
01:42:07.121 --> 01:42:07.930
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

3428
01:42:07.930 --> 01:42:11.200
<v Speaker 4>And it's the reason why your left hand is the inappropriate hand to shake hands</v>

3429
01:42:11.201 --> 01:42:13.720
<v Speaker 4>with and already in the Arab and.</v>

3430
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:14.623
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3431
01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:15.520
<v Speaker 4>And that they,</v>

3432
01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:17.670
<v Speaker 4>they always clean with their left hand.</v>

3433
01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:20.510
<v Speaker 4>The Shit experiment.</v>

3434
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:21.850
<v Speaker 4>Did you actually make people do that?</v>

3435
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:22.890
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know.</v>

3436
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:23.860
<v Speaker 4>Know what happened.</v>

3437
01:42:23.861 --> 01:42:27.370
<v Speaker 4>I pussied out to fucking Ted again to ted get involved with bitches.</v>

3438
01:42:27.730 --> 01:42:28.241
<v Speaker 4>No balls.</v>

3439
01:42:28.241 --> 01:42:29.074
<v Speaker 4>No Shit.</v>

3440
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:30.223
<v Speaker 4>You're out of here.</v>

3441
01:42:30.330 --> 01:42:31.330
<v Speaker 4>Do you want in the call?</v>

3442
01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:32.223
<v Speaker 4>Yes or no?</v>

3443
01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:37.120
<v Speaker 4>It just took down a couple more videos recently of WHO's here,</v>

3444
01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:38.223
<v Speaker 4>I'll find it,</v>

3445
01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:43.390
<v Speaker 4>but then they put the hancock and sheldrake ones back up on the different part</v>

3446
01:42:43.391 --> 01:42:44.224
<v Speaker 4>of the site.</v>

3447
01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:45.730
<v Speaker 4>He ever took them down.</v>

3448
01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:46.271
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

3449
01:42:46.271 --> 01:42:50.200
<v Speaker 4>They took them off of one part and they put it on another part and they put it</v>

3450
01:42:50.201 --> 01:42:55.200
<v Speaker 4>up with a disclaimer because they felt like that there was poor science.</v>

3451
01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:55.811
<v Speaker 4>There was bad,</v>

3452
01:42:55.811 --> 01:42:57.070
<v Speaker 4>so pseudo science,</v>

3453
01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:02.760
<v Speaker 4>which if if the scientists can prove it makes sense,</v>

3454
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.320
<v Speaker 4>but I think that if you.</v>

3455
01:43:05.321 --> 01:43:09.250
<v Speaker 4>You're going to invite someone to talk and you're going to say that they have</v>

3456
01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:10.173
<v Speaker 4>pseudoscience.</v>

3457
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:14.650
<v Speaker 4>I said at the very least you should allow them to have a,</v>

3458
01:43:14.651 --> 01:43:17.350
<v Speaker 4>an appropriate response or allow them to a debate.</v>

3459
01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:20.140
<v Speaker 4>You know them on the merits of this science.</v>

3460
01:43:20.170 --> 01:43:20.770
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3461
01:43:20.770 --> 01:43:22.270
<v Speaker 4>Because I don't know who's right or who's wrong.</v>

3462
01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:22.481
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3463
01:43:22.481 --> 01:43:25.720
<v Speaker 4>the anonymous scientific panel that they use,</v>

3464
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:30.220
<v Speaker 4>that's what I think is bullshit because they've got a lot of mainstream people</v>

3465
01:43:30.250 --> 01:43:31.420
<v Speaker 4>who are going to say,</v>

3466
01:43:31.421 --> 01:43:31.841
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3467
01:43:31.841 --> 01:43:34.060
<v Speaker 4>whatever Iowasca is bullshit,</v>

3468
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:35.890
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

3469
01:43:35.891 --> 01:43:38.530
<v Speaker 4>let let sheldrake debate that.</v>

3470
01:43:38.531 --> 01:43:40.090
<v Speaker 4>Or in that case it was hancock.</v>

3471
01:43:40.091 --> 01:43:41.560
<v Speaker 4>I think he was talking about Iowasca,</v>

3472
01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:42.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3473
01:43:42.191 --> 01:43:45.250
<v Speaker 4>or get a Andrew Weil who's an expert,</v>

3474
01:43:45.251 --> 01:43:48.460
<v Speaker 4>ms or a way Davis Actually Wade Davis and Andrew,</v>

3475
01:43:48.461 --> 01:43:50.620
<v Speaker 4>while we're both graduate students,</v>

3476
01:43:50.621 --> 01:43:52.530
<v Speaker 4>have Richard Evans</v>

3477
01:43:52.530 --> 01:43:53.363
<v Speaker 2>shelties,</v>

3478
01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:56.730
<v Speaker 2>who was probably the most important</v>

3479
01:43:58.240 --> 01:43:59.073
<v Speaker 2>bio,</v>

3480
01:43:59.310 --> 01:43:59.611
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

3481
01:43:59.611 --> 01:44:01.620
<v Speaker 2>botanist of the 20th century.</v>

3482
01:44:01.621 --> 01:44:06.621
<v Speaker 2>He's the one who discovered the plants behind and named the plants behind</v>

3483
01:44:06.631 --> 01:44:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Iowasca and La.</v>

3484
01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:10.290
<v Speaker 2>He did his graduate work on God.</v>

3485
01:44:10.670 --> 01:44:11.670
<v Speaker 2>He never.</v>

3486
01:44:11.671 --> 01:44:14.070
<v Speaker 2>He was a very sort of straight guy himself.</v>

3487
01:44:14.071 --> 01:44:15.630
<v Speaker 2>He never took any of this stuff,</v>

3488
01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:19.350
<v Speaker 2>but he discovered dozens of psychoactive plants in the Amazon.</v>

3489
01:44:19.351 --> 01:44:20.220
<v Speaker 2>He was down there like 20 years</v>

3490
01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.073
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

3491
01:44:21.250 --> 01:44:22.630
<v Speaker 5>That sounds all great.</v>

3492
01:44:22.631 --> 01:44:22.841
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3493
01:44:22.841 --> 01:44:26.980
<v Speaker 5>that's absolutely great for expanding people's knowledge on the subject,</v>

3494
01:44:26.981 --> 01:44:29.020
<v Speaker 5>but in their particular situation,</v>

3495
01:44:29.021 --> 01:44:32.140
<v Speaker 5>what was kind of disturbing was that on the website of Ted,</v>

3496
01:44:32.170 --> 01:44:36.220
<v Speaker 5>the accusations that they had or the reasons that they had for censoring</v>

3497
01:44:36.221 --> 01:44:37.180
<v Speaker 5>Hancock's work,</v>

3498
01:44:37.630 --> 01:44:39.700
<v Speaker 5>he asked them specifically site where I said,</v>

3499
01:44:39.701 --> 01:44:41.160
<v Speaker 5>this site where I apply this,</v>

3500
01:44:41.161 --> 01:44:42.070
<v Speaker 5>this is not what I said.</v>

3501
01:44:42.230 --> 01:44:47.230
<v Speaker 5>So he was saying that they sort of made this justification that didn't sort of</v>

3502
01:44:47.381 --> 01:44:49.000
<v Speaker 5>jive with his talk.</v>

3503
01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:50.890
<v Speaker 5>Now Rupert Sheldrake,</v>

3504
01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:55.150
<v Speaker 5>who I think is a bit more controversial in his,</v>

3505
01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:56.050
<v Speaker 5>his statements,</v>

3506
01:44:56.450 --> 01:44:56.800
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

3507
01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:01.800
<v Speaker 5>what Hancock is trying to say is that Iowasca has had this profound effect on</v>

3508
01:45:02.441 --> 01:45:06.670
<v Speaker 5>humanity and it's based on his own actual personal experiences taking it,</v>

3509
01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:08.920
<v Speaker 5>the experiences of other people that have taken it.</v>

3510
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:09.760
<v Speaker 5>The I,</v>

3511
01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:14.760
<v Speaker 5>the idea being that this indigenous population was not the only peoples that</v>

3512
01:45:15.311 --> 01:45:16.810
<v Speaker 5>have discovered psychedelic plants,</v>

3513
01:45:16.811 --> 01:45:21.190
<v Speaker 5>but then in fact there's a cave art that details people in altered states of</v>

3514
01:45:21.191 --> 01:45:25.030
<v Speaker 5>consciousness also details what they believe to be certain psychedelic</v>

3515
01:45:25.031 --> 01:45:29.380
<v Speaker 5>substances and that it's most likely responsible for a lot of art.</v>

3516
01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:30.280
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3517
01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:32.560
<v Speaker 5>and I think that's a pretty reasonable thing to say.</v>

3518
01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:33.970
<v Speaker 5>And if you don't think it's reasonable,</v>

3519
01:45:33.971 --> 01:45:38.770
<v Speaker 5>the only thing I could say is I doubt you've had any psychedelic experiences</v>

3520
01:45:39.130 --> 01:45:42.770
<v Speaker 5>because psychedelic experiences would be incredibly profound to monitor</v>

3521
01:45:42.850 --> 01:45:45.310
<v Speaker 5>primitive man and to state any best.</v>

3522
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:48.160
<v Speaker 5>Seems to me that you're not being honest.</v>

3523
01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:49.300
<v Speaker 5>You're ignorant.</v>

3524
01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:52.840
<v Speaker 5>You're either ignorant to the effects of these things or you're not being honest</v>

3525
01:45:52.841 --> 01:45:55.690
<v Speaker 5>about the effects of these things because you're worried about the perception</v>

3526
01:45:55.900 --> 01:45:58.630
<v Speaker 5>that mainstream academia,</v>

3527
01:45:58.690 --> 01:46:00.760
<v Speaker 5>that most people in the media,</v>

3528
01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:03.010
<v Speaker 5>when you start talking about mushrooms,</v>

3529
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:04.330
<v Speaker 5>they think you're a silly person.</v>

3530
01:46:04.510 --> 01:46:05.730
<v Speaker 5>You're a fool is again,</v>

3531
01:46:05.730 --> 01:46:05.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3532
01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:10.020
<v Speaker 2>That's the institution determining the information that's allowed to flow</v>

3533
01:46:10.021 --> 01:46:11.250
<v Speaker 2>through that institution.</v>

3534
01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:11.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3535
01:46:11.911 --> 01:46:12.750
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed,</v>

3536
01:46:12.751 --> 01:46:13.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3537
01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Charles grobe a couple of weeks ago who was at Ucla.</v>

3538
01:46:16.151 --> 01:46:21.151
<v Speaker 2>He's a psychiatrist at Ucla who uses a silicide and I think he's also used mgma</v>

3539
01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:27.740
<v Speaker 2>in psychotherapy with people who have end stage cancer to help them.</v>

3540
01:46:28.770 --> 01:46:33.770
<v Speaker 2>It's been very effective in helping them deal with the fear of death because of</v>

3541
01:46:33.781 --> 01:46:38.460
<v Speaker 2>the sort of transcendent transcendent experience that often accompanies these</v>

3542
01:46:38.461 --> 01:46:39.294
<v Speaker 2>substances.</v>

3543
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:42.760
<v Speaker 2>They feel a sense of union with the university.</v>

3544
01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:44.100
<v Speaker 2>They lose a lot of that,</v>

3545
01:46:44.101 --> 01:46:44.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3546
01:46:44.371 --> 01:46:47.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm just my body feeling which helps them deal with death.</v>

3547
01:46:47.850 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 2>So transfer that to what saying about</v>

3548
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:51.400
<v Speaker 6>I'm a hunter gatherer.</v>

3549
01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:55.680
<v Speaker 6>People are pre agricultural people around the world or post agricultural people</v>

3550
01:46:55.681 --> 01:46:57.180
<v Speaker 6>so much in India and,</v>

3551
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:58.191
<v Speaker 6>and a lot of,</v>

3552
01:46:58.191 --> 01:46:58.430
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3553
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.730
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

3554
01:46:58.730 --> 01:46:59.760
<v Speaker 6>the ulysses,</v>

3555
01:46:59.761 --> 01:47:00.451
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3556
01:47:00.451 --> 01:47:02.420
<v Speaker 6>the Elisa and fields in ancient Greeks.</v>

3557
01:47:02.670 --> 01:47:05.700
<v Speaker 6>A lot of these rituals were apparently based on,</v>

3558
01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:06.530
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3559
01:47:06.530 --> 01:47:07.740
<v Speaker 6>Amanita Muscarella,</v>

3560
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:10.440
<v Speaker 6>which is a highly hallucinogenic.</v>

3561
01:47:10.441 --> 01:47:14.220
<v Speaker 6>It's the red mushroom with the white spots in Alice in wonderland.</v>

3562
01:47:14.221 --> 01:47:14.611
<v Speaker 6>And Yeah,</v>

3563
01:47:14.611 --> 01:47:15.090
<v Speaker 6>silence,</v>

3564
01:47:15.090 --> 01:47:16.360
<v Speaker 5>Santa Claus connection.</v>

3565
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:17.451
<v Speaker 5>Very famous.</v>

3566
01:47:17.451 --> 01:47:18.284
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

3567
01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:20.360
<v Speaker 5>The AMANITA Mascara is.</v>

3568
01:47:20.361 --> 01:47:21.710
<v Speaker 5>So has that been proven?</v>

3569
01:47:21.711 --> 01:47:22.140
<v Speaker 5>Is that.</v>

3570
01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:22.441
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3571
01:47:22.441 --> 01:47:22.950
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

3572
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:26.550
<v Speaker 6>it's a theory that was proposed by Gordon Wasson who,</v>

3573
01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:27.170
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3574
01:47:27.170 --> 01:47:27.270
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3575
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:30.450
<v Speaker 6>this is all stuff you can like mind Stanley on Saturday,</v>

3576
01:47:30.451 --> 01:47:31.284
<v Speaker 6>he was like,</v>

3577
01:47:31.530 --> 01:47:35.190
<v Speaker 6>Stanley met a woman,</v>

3578
01:47:35.191 --> 01:47:39.330
<v Speaker 6>the Shaman in Mexico who brought mushrooms into the Western world.</v>

3579
01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:42.120
<v Speaker 6>I'm Maria Sabina.</v>

3580
01:47:42.121 --> 01:47:42.571
<v Speaker 6>Maria,</v>

3581
01:47:42.571 --> 01:47:42.871
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>

3582
01:47:42.871 --> 01:47:43.640
<v Speaker 6>Is there any,</v>

3583
01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:43.850
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3584
01:47:43.850 --> 01:47:46.620
<v Speaker 6>any way that the point I was making is that,</v>

3585
01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:47.340
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3586
01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:52.340
<v Speaker 6>here's this guy using this stuff to alleviate the fear of death with dramatic</v>

3587
01:47:52.471 --> 01:47:53.070
<v Speaker 6>results.</v>

3588
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:53.461
<v Speaker 6>And yet,</v>

3589
01:47:53.461 --> 01:47:54.300
<v Speaker 6>as you say,</v>

3590
01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:56.910
<v Speaker 6>it's still considered fringe.</v>

3591
01:47:57.180 --> 01:48:01.320
<v Speaker 6>Although relating back to our earlier conversation about institutions being in</v>

3592
01:48:01.321 --> 01:48:02.430
<v Speaker 6>the state of crisis,</v>

3593
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:07.590
<v Speaker 6>because people sort of recognize the false values and these institutions,</v>

3594
01:48:08.010 --> 01:48:09.980
<v Speaker 6>the government finally allowing researchers.</v>

3595
01:48:09.981 --> 01:48:10.630
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3596
01:48:10.630 --> 01:48:11.463
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3597
01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:13.820
<v Speaker 5>It's a pretty radical findings.</v>

3598
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:14.280
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3599
01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:17.620
<v Speaker 5>the John Hopkins Study on Psilocybin and behavioral change,</v>

3600
01:48:17.890 --> 01:48:22.870
<v Speaker 5>how it just one trip affected people's behavior and personality is positively 20</v>

3601
01:48:22.871 --> 01:48:23.450
<v Speaker 5>years later.</v>

3602
01:48:23.450 --> 01:48:23.750
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3603
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:28.190
<v Speaker 6>and what Hancock was talking about with specifically the effect of some</v>

3604
01:48:28.191 --> 01:48:30.170
<v Speaker 6>hallucinogens on addiction.</v>

3605
01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:30.760
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3606
01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:33.340
<v Speaker 5>And he was using his own personal addiction to cannabis.</v>

3607
01:48:33.341 --> 01:48:36.610
<v Speaker 5>He had a lifelong history of abuse as he called it,</v>

3608
01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:37.870
<v Speaker 5>with cannabis.</v>

3609
01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:39.350
<v Speaker 6>Say,</v>

3610
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:40.181
<v Speaker 6>sorry to interrupt you,</v>

3611
01:48:40.181 --> 01:48:42.520
<v Speaker 6>but just the last point on that I,</v>

3612
01:48:42.521 --> 01:48:44.110
<v Speaker 6>I didn't listen to sheldrake's thing,</v>

3613
01:48:44.111 --> 01:48:49.060
<v Speaker 6>but I did listen to Hancock and he framed the whole thing in I think very</v>

3614
01:48:49.330 --> 01:48:50.170
<v Speaker 6>scientific terms.</v>

3615
01:48:50.171 --> 01:48:50.560
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

3616
01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:54.190
<v Speaker 6>this may have caused this leap forward in consciousness.</v>

3617
01:48:54.191 --> 01:48:56.890
<v Speaker 6>This may have been responsible for this and that</v>

3618
01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:00.400
<v Speaker 5>it's absolutely a fascinating possibility to consider.</v>

3619
01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:04.540
<v Speaker 5>And the only people in my opinion that would not consider it are again,</v>

3620
01:49:04.810 --> 01:49:09.430
<v Speaker 5>people that have had no experiences with it or people that were worried about</v>

3621
01:49:09.431 --> 01:49:11.500
<v Speaker 5>the mainstream academic approval.</v>

3622
01:49:11.501 --> 01:49:13.060
<v Speaker 5>And so they step back and go,</v>

3623
01:49:13.061 --> 01:49:13.211
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3624
01:49:13.211 --> 01:49:14.470
<v Speaker 5>this is preposterous,</v>

3625
01:49:15.150 --> 01:49:15.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3626
01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:16.540
<v Speaker 5>this is not,</v>

3627
01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:18.880
<v Speaker 5>it's an incredibly powerful experience.</v>

3628
01:49:18.881 --> 01:49:20.050
<v Speaker 5>It cannot be denied.</v>

3629
01:49:20.090 --> 01:49:20.350
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3630
01:49:20.350 --> 01:49:21.970
<v Speaker 5>and yet for whatever reason,</v>

3631
01:49:22.150 --> 01:49:25.030
<v Speaker 5>we've lumped it into silliness and I really,</v>

3632
01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:26.460
<v Speaker 5>I struggled with now,</v>

3633
01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:27.221
<v Speaker 5>or criminality.</v>

3634
01:49:27.221 --> 01:49:27.461
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

3635
01:49:27.461 --> 01:49:28.750
<v Speaker 5>even more scary than silliness.</v>

3636
01:49:29.150 --> 01:49:29.760
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3637
01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:30.160
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

3638
01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:30.320
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3639
01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:32.320
<v Speaker 5>really it's really boggled my mind.</v>

3640
01:49:32.321 --> 01:49:35.050
<v Speaker 5>And the only thing that makes sense is that it's ignorance.</v>

3641
01:49:35.051 --> 01:49:36.790
<v Speaker 5>It's the illegality of it,</v>

3642
01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:40.810
<v Speaker 5>which was a hoist onto the American people in the 19 seventies when they were</v>

3643
01:49:40.811 --> 01:49:45.700
<v Speaker 5>just trying to control this mass change in culture that had happened so</v>

3644
01:49:45.701 --> 01:49:47.020
<v Speaker 5>radically between the fifties,</v>

3645
01:49:47.110 --> 01:49:47.943
<v Speaker 5>the sixties.</v>

3646
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:51.070
<v Speaker 5>And we lost a lot of information in that.</v>

3647
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:53.650
<v Speaker 5>And we also got a lot of people that were scared,</v>

3648
01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:55.180
<v Speaker 5>scared about going to jail,</v>

3649
01:49:55.181 --> 01:50:00.181
<v Speaker 5>scared about losing their jobs and that all that fear and ignorance clouds the</v>

3650
01:50:00.431 --> 01:50:01.330
<v Speaker 5>actual argument.</v>

3651
01:50:01.331 --> 01:50:06.040
<v Speaker 5>It clouds the actual facts that surround these weird substances.</v>

3652
01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:06.930
<v Speaker 5>And they,</v>

3653
01:50:06.930 --> 01:50:08.200
<v Speaker 5>they're not the cure all.</v>

3654
01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:08.860
<v Speaker 5>They're not,</v>

3655
01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:09.281
<v Speaker 5>they're not,</v>

3656
01:50:09.281 --> 01:50:10.600
<v Speaker 5>they're not for everybody.</v>

3657
01:50:10.820 --> 01:50:13.960
<v Speaker 5>But what they are is incredibly powerful experiences.</v>

3658
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:19.390
<v Speaker 5>I think that can be denied and to deny the impact of one of the most amazing</v>

3659
01:50:20.170 --> 01:50:24.550
<v Speaker 5>trends in dental experiences that a human being can ever possibly experience and</v>

3660
01:50:24.730 --> 01:50:27.010
<v Speaker 5>the fact that it's an orally active thing,</v>

3661
01:50:27.011 --> 01:50:31.090
<v Speaker 5>that it grows all over the place where these people absolutely lived.</v>

3662
01:50:31.450 --> 01:50:34.240
<v Speaker 5>To deny the connection seems really silly.</v>

3663
01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:34.711
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't.</v>

3664
01:50:34.711 --> 01:50:35.544
<v Speaker 5>It seems like you're.</v>

3665
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:37.110
<v Speaker 5>You're being a fool and you're.</v>

3666
01:50:37.111 --> 01:50:38.390
<v Speaker 5>You're ignoring information</v>

3667
01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:41.360
<v Speaker 6>and people all over the world who have access to these plants,</v>

3668
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:42.890
<v Speaker 6>wherever you find them,</v>

3669
01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:45.860
<v Speaker 6>consider them to be the greatest gift of the gods.</v>

3670
01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:46.460
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

3671
01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:49.160
<v Speaker 6>and then you've got our culture that says,</v>

3672
01:50:49.610 --> 01:50:52.460
<v Speaker 6>if you get caught with an ounce of Siliciden,</v>

3673
01:50:52.461 --> 01:50:55.250
<v Speaker 6>mushrooms are 100 hits of acid at a grateful dead show.</v>

3674
01:50:55.251 --> 01:50:59.630
<v Speaker 6>You go to prison under minimum mandatory sentencing for longer than second</v>

3675
01:50:59.631 --> 01:51:00.261
<v Speaker 6>degree murder.</v>

3676
01:51:00.261 --> 01:51:00.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3677
01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:01.910
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck is that?</v>

3678
01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:05.580
<v Speaker 5>That's complete pure insanity that that's insanity,</v>

3679
01:51:05.581 --> 01:51:10.581
<v Speaker 5>but what's even more and sanity is to me that people in positions of prominence</v>

3680
01:51:11.101 --> 01:51:16.101
<v Speaker 5>academically who will talk on these subjects have not had this experience and</v>

3681
01:51:17.071 --> 01:51:17.821
<v Speaker 5>I'm like my God,</v>

3682
01:51:17.821 --> 01:51:18.630
<v Speaker 5>your children,</v>

3683
01:51:18.630 --> 01:51:20.550
<v Speaker 5>and it sounds so arrogant to say that,</v>

3684
01:51:20.730 --> 01:51:25.690
<v Speaker 5>but someone who's like talking about the negative effects of psychedelic drugs</v>

3685
01:51:25.691 --> 01:51:29.550
<v Speaker 5>that hasn't had psychedelic drugs will feel like a child after he has a mushroom</v>

3686
01:51:29.551 --> 01:51:29.980
<v Speaker 5>chip.</v>

3687
01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:31.050
<v Speaker 5>He will feel like a full.</v>

3688
01:51:31.170 --> 01:51:35.880
<v Speaker 5>You will feel like you the dumbest person in the world to have ignored that and</v>

3689
01:51:35.881 --> 01:51:38.790
<v Speaker 5>Pooh poohed that takes six grams of mushrooms,</v>

3690
01:51:38.791 --> 01:51:43.170
<v Speaker 5>get in an isolation tank and tell me you don't have some regrets for how you</v>

3691
01:51:43.171 --> 01:51:44.370
<v Speaker 5>look at that shit before.</v>

3692
01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:45.410
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3693
01:51:45.410 --> 01:51:46.990
<v Speaker 5>They're not having it and it's these.</v>

3694
01:51:46.991 --> 01:51:49.800
<v Speaker 5>These are the same people that are pulling these things down.</v>

3695
01:51:49.801 --> 01:51:53.700
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you the people that have had profound mushroom trips are not</v>

3696
01:51:53.701 --> 01:51:54.331
<v Speaker 5>interested in,</v>

3697
01:51:54.331 --> 01:51:54.870
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

3698
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:59.250
<v Speaker 5>in silencing this Graham Hancock a war on consciousness,</v>

3699
01:51:59.251 --> 01:52:01.470
<v Speaker 5>which originally was called beating.</v>

3700
01:52:01.470 --> 01:52:03.060
<v Speaker 5>I think something about the green bitch.</v>

3701
01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:05.010
<v Speaker 5>He reasonably could defeating the Green Bitch,</v>

3702
01:52:05.011 --> 01:52:06.080
<v Speaker 5>which was his addiction,</v>

3703
01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:07.800
<v Speaker 5>cannabis and how the.</v>

3704
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:08.280
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

3705
01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:11.700
<v Speaker 5>the IOWASCA helped him see who he was,</v>

3706
01:52:11.701 --> 01:52:12.400
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>

3707
01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:12.670
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>

3708
01:52:12.670 --> 01:52:12.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3709
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:16.710
<v Speaker 5>abusive relationship and it seems really fascinating guy because he's not down</v>

3710
01:52:16.711 --> 01:52:18.210
<v Speaker 5>on marijuana at all.</v>

3711
01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:23.250
<v Speaker 5>He's sort of attributes it to his own abuse of it and using it as a crutch</v>

3712
01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:25.800
<v Speaker 5>instead of using it to enhance,</v>

3713
01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:26.251
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3714
01:52:26.251 --> 01:52:29.520
<v Speaker 5>so he had whatever addictive issues he had.</v>

3715
01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:31.140
<v Speaker 5>That's how they mean that.</v>

3716
01:52:31.141 --> 01:52:32.580
<v Speaker 5>And that is a real issue with addiction,</v>

3717
01:52:32.581 --> 01:52:32.821
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3718
01:52:32.821 --> 01:52:33.090
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3719
01:52:33.090 --> 01:52:37.650
<v Speaker 5>it's not necessarily the substance of the biologic triggers what's going on with</v>

3720
01:52:37.651 --> 01:52:39.870
<v Speaker 5>you that makes you obsess with scratch tickets.</v>

3721
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:40.220
<v Speaker 5>Who's</v>

3722
01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:40.791
<v Speaker 6>The guy?</v>

3723
01:52:40.791 --> 01:52:43.790
<v Speaker 6>I'm the British actors,</v>

3724
01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:44.690
<v Speaker 6>Guinea comedian.</v>

3725
01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:46.460
<v Speaker 6>Really Guy Sleeping with Russell brand,</v>

3726
01:52:46.461 --> 01:52:47.181
<v Speaker 6>Russell brand.</v>

3727
01:52:47.181 --> 01:52:48.014
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

3728
01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:49.603
<v Speaker 6>Should play.</v>

3729
01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:51.530
<v Speaker 6>This is what happens when we get all that back.</v>

3730
01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:54.710
<v Speaker 6>I remember the Guy fucking point me my brain,</v>

3731
01:52:54.711 --> 01:52:58.280
<v Speaker 6>I'll just stick in the air massage guy likes massages.</v>

3732
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.990
<v Speaker 6>Russell brand wrote a thing recently about addiction and he said something I</v>

3733
01:53:02.991 --> 01:53:03.890
<v Speaker 6>thought was really wise.</v>

3734
01:53:03.891 --> 01:53:06.710
<v Speaker 6>He said drugs weren't my problem,</v>

3735
01:53:06.711 --> 01:53:08.960
<v Speaker 6>drugs were my answer to my problem.</v>

3736
01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:10.120
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3737
01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:10.520
<v Speaker 6>and it's,</v>

3738
01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:11.990
<v Speaker 6>it's exactly what you just said in that.</v>

3739
01:53:11.991 --> 01:53:13.460
<v Speaker 6>I agree completely.</v>

3740
01:53:13.490 --> 01:53:15.890
<v Speaker 6>Drugs aren't causing the addiction.</v>

3741
01:53:15.891 --> 01:53:17.240
<v Speaker 6>You've got an addiction,</v>

3742
01:53:17.570 --> 01:53:19.460
<v Speaker 6>it can manifest as you know,</v>

3743
01:53:19.461 --> 01:53:20.221
<v Speaker 6>in marijuana,</v>

3744
01:53:20.221 --> 01:53:22.880
<v Speaker 6>in gambling and jerking off and you know,</v>

3745
01:53:22.890 --> 01:53:27.890
<v Speaker 6>a million different ways and if you locate the problem in the substance then</v>

3746
01:53:28.191 --> 01:53:30.510
<v Speaker 6>you'll never solve the problem because that's just a symptom,</v>

3747
01:53:30.511 --> 01:53:30.620
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3748
01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:33.350
<v Speaker 5>There is a physiological issue that goes along with that as well.</v>

3749
01:53:33.351 --> 01:53:35.450
<v Speaker 5>So because there's two types of situations,</v>

3750
01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:39.260
<v Speaker 5>there's the gambling situation where you're sort of getting addicted to the</v>

3751
01:53:39.261 --> 01:53:40.094
<v Speaker 5>response,</v>

3752
01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:41.510
<v Speaker 5>but then there's a real like,</v>

3753
01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:42.800
<v Speaker 5>like an oxycontin thing.</v>

3754
01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:47.300
<v Speaker 5>Like I have a friend who had a back operation and then after his back operation</v>

3755
01:53:47.301 --> 01:53:51.680
<v Speaker 5>they throw them on some oxygen and he was fucked up for a long time.</v>

3756
01:53:51.681 --> 01:53:55.700
<v Speaker 5>He started getting prescriptions from more than one different doctor and he was</v>

3757
01:53:55.701 --> 01:53:56.534
<v Speaker 5>a mess.</v>

3758
01:53:56.600 --> 01:53:57.433
<v Speaker 5>He just went,</v>

3759
01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:01.910
<v Speaker 5>I just went crazy spiral and it was absolutely a physiological addiction because</v>

3760
01:54:01.911 --> 01:54:06.450
<v Speaker 5>before that he really didn't exhibit crazy addictive or impulsive behaviors and</v>

3761
01:54:06.451 --> 01:54:07.780
<v Speaker 5>they were manifested itself with these.</v>

3762
01:54:07.781 --> 01:54:08.614
<v Speaker 5>But it's situation</v>

3763
01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:13.620
<v Speaker 6>changed with that pain and the gambler is also getting a chemical a high.</v>

3764
01:54:15.370 --> 01:54:15.660
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

3765
01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:15.980
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3766
01:54:15.980 --> 01:54:19.000
<v Speaker 6>the brain is releasing endorphins or whatever it is.</v>

3767
01:54:19.001 --> 01:54:19.870
<v Speaker 6>And in that case,</v>

3768
01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:20.710
<v Speaker 6>so there,</v>

3769
01:54:20.710 --> 01:54:20.951
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3770
01:54:20.951 --> 01:54:23.890
<v Speaker 6>you could argue they're both physiological on some level,</v>

3771
01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:24.761
<v Speaker 6>but yeah,</v>

3772
01:54:24.761 --> 01:54:26.320
<v Speaker 6>the point is that there is some,</v>

3773
01:54:26.380 --> 01:54:28.060
<v Speaker 6>in his case it was chronic pain.</v>

3774
01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:31.510
<v Speaker 6>In another case it could be ptsd,</v>

3775
01:54:31.511 --> 01:54:33.490
<v Speaker 6>it could be a fucked up childhood,</v>

3776
01:54:33.491 --> 01:54:34.390
<v Speaker 6>it could be whatever.</v>

3777
01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:36.600
<v Speaker 5>That is a funny way to look at it that I never think I,</v>

3778
01:54:36.601 --> 01:54:39.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I ever looked at it that way before that it is still a chemical</v>

3779
01:54:39.711 --> 01:54:40.191
<v Speaker 5>addiction.</v>

3780
01:54:40.191 --> 01:54:41.750
<v Speaker 5>It's just sort of an endogenous one.</v>

3781
01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:42.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3782
01:54:42.290 --> 01:54:42.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3783
01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:43.461
<v Speaker 5>That's funny.</v>

3784
01:54:43.461 --> 01:54:44.660
<v Speaker 5>I never thought about it that way.</v>

3785
01:54:44.661 --> 01:54:45.980
<v Speaker 5>I was knocked it off</v>

3786
01:54:46.770 --> 01:54:47.150
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

3787
01:54:47.150 --> 01:54:47.630
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3788
01:54:47.630 --> 01:54:47.841
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3789
01:54:47.841 --> 01:54:50.780
<v Speaker 6>orgasm as people jerk off in front of the computer all day.</v>

3790
01:54:50.781 --> 01:54:52.610
<v Speaker 6>They're get there some we're talking to you.</v>

3791
01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:53.211
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3792
01:54:53.211 --> 01:54:53.690
<v Speaker 6>That's you.</v>

3793
01:54:53.690 --> 01:54:54.071
<v Speaker 6>That's you,</v>

3794
01:54:54.071 --> 01:54:54.741
<v Speaker 6>you motherfucker.</v>

3795
01:54:54.741 --> 01:54:55.574
<v Speaker 6>You know you are.</v>

3796
01:54:58.480 --> 01:54:59.120
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3797
01:54:59.120 --> 01:54:59.421
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3798
01:54:59.421 --> 01:54:59.750
<v Speaker 6>That's.</v>

3799
01:54:59.750 --> 01:55:03.850
<v Speaker 6>Well that's also sort of just becomes like impulsive it,</v>

3800
01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:06.260
<v Speaker 6>like it was not even a reward sometimes it just,</v>

3801
01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:07.970
<v Speaker 6>just sort of repeat a pattern.</v>

3802
01:55:07.971 --> 01:55:08.780
<v Speaker 6>Like you're stuck.</v>

3803
01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:10.610
<v Speaker 6>You got to scratch her when you stop.</v>

3804
01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:12.320
<v Speaker 6>And that's what addiction is.</v>

3805
01:55:12.590 --> 01:55:13.423
<v Speaker 6>It hurts when you stopped.</v>

3806
01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:14.780
<v Speaker 6>You were talking earlier,</v>

3807
01:55:14.781 --> 01:55:18.440
<v Speaker 6>we were talking about primitive so called primitive societies and stuff.</v>

3808
01:55:18.441 --> 01:55:23.441
<v Speaker 6>You reminded me of this amazing story I read recently where this BBC team went</v>

3809
01:55:23.841 --> 01:55:28.841
<v Speaker 6>into Papa New Guinea way back some river and they were doing a special on these</v>

3810
01:55:29.211 --> 01:55:31.550
<v Speaker 6>very so called primitive people back there,</v>

3811
01:55:31.551 --> 01:55:31.821
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3812
01:55:31.821 --> 01:55:32.451
<v Speaker 6>no Internet,</v>

3813
01:55:32.451 --> 01:55:33.284
<v Speaker 6>no nothing.</v>

3814
01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:35.450
<v Speaker 6>And one of the guys,</v>

3815
01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:35.900
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3816
01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:37.370
<v Speaker 6>after they'd finished filming,</v>

3817
01:55:37.371 --> 01:55:38.151
<v Speaker 6>one of the guys said,</v>

3818
01:55:38.151 --> 01:55:38.301
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3819
01:55:38.301 --> 01:55:38.690
<v Speaker 6>you've,</v>

3820
01:55:38.690 --> 01:55:39.950
<v Speaker 6>we've shown you our world.</v>

3821
01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:41.900
<v Speaker 6>Why don't you bring me to your world?</v>

3822
01:55:41.901 --> 01:55:43.010
<v Speaker 6>I'd like to see your world.</v>

3823
01:55:43.410 --> 01:55:44.220
<v Speaker 6>So when he was back</v>

3824
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:44.881
<v Speaker 2>in London,</v>

3825
01:55:44.881 --> 01:55:47.520
<v Speaker 2>he talked to some people and they said,</v>

3826
01:55:47.521 --> 01:55:47.761
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3827
01:55:47.761 --> 01:55:48.001
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3828
01:55:48.001 --> 01:55:48.690
<v Speaker 2>we'll fund it.</v>

3829
01:55:48.690 --> 01:55:50.070
<v Speaker 2>That would be an interesting thing.</v>

3830
01:55:50.071 --> 01:55:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Bring these guys into London and you know,</v>

3831
01:55:51.721 --> 01:55:53.430
<v Speaker 2>and do this whole thing sort of in reverse.</v>

3832
01:55:54.450 --> 01:55:54.890
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

3833
01:55:54.890 --> 01:55:55.723
<v Speaker 2>It's a sitcom.</v>

3834
01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3835
01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:57.190
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3836
01:55:57.190 --> 01:55:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Realities.</v>

3837
01:55:57.820 --> 01:55:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Dude's fucking reality shifts.</v>

3838
01:55:59.821 --> 01:56:00.570
<v Speaker 2>Take them in London.</v>

3839
01:56:00.570 --> 01:56:01.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3840
01:56:01.050 --> 01:56:03.810
<v Speaker 2>So the Jersey shore for the UK.</v>

3841
01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:06.693
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3842
01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:07.800
<v Speaker 2>so this guy,</v>

3843
01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:12.360
<v Speaker 2>his concern was that once this guy saw the modern world,</v>

3844
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:13.560
<v Speaker 2>he would never want to go home.</v>

3845
01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:16.350
<v Speaker 2>So he called up an anthropologist and he said,</v>

3846
01:56:16.351 --> 01:56:16.561
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3847
01:56:16.561 --> 01:56:17.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm really worried about this.</v>

3848
01:56:17.551 --> 01:56:18.420
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to do this,</v>

3849
01:56:18.421 --> 01:56:18.940
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

3850
01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:21.990
<v Speaker 2>And the anthropologists send you arrogant asshole.</v>

3851
01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:26.250
<v Speaker 2>You really think this guy's going to be so impressed by London that he'd never</v>

3852
01:56:26.251 --> 01:56:28.820
<v Speaker 2>want to go back to his friends and family and you know,</v>

3853
01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:30.810
<v Speaker 2>his whole world and all that just calm down.</v>

3854
01:56:30.811 --> 01:56:31.680
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to happen.</v>

3855
01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:31.921
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3856
01:56:31.921 --> 01:56:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Trust.</v>

3857
01:56:32.610 --> 01:56:34.230
<v Speaker 2>So they fly this guy,</v>

3858
01:56:34.231 --> 01:56:37.620
<v Speaker 2>if you guys up to London or they take them all around,</v>

3859
01:56:37.621 --> 01:56:38.071
<v Speaker 2>show them,</v>

3860
01:56:38.071 --> 01:56:38.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3861
01:56:38.311 --> 01:56:38.851
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

3862
01:56:38.851 --> 01:56:39.684
<v Speaker 2>all these different things.</v>

3863
01:56:39.870 --> 01:56:44.490
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things they really wanted to see was something like a,</v>

3864
01:56:44.730 --> 01:56:46.290
<v Speaker 2>an archery range.</v>

3865
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:50.550
<v Speaker 2>So they took them to this archery range and they were so fascinated by the</v>

3866
01:56:50.551 --> 01:56:54.270
<v Speaker 2>arrows that had feathers on the era of the flushings.</v>

3867
01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:54.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3868
01:56:54.691 --> 01:56:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Their feathers didn't have arrows.</v>

3869
01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Arrows in the federal.</v>

3870
01:56:57.960 --> 01:56:58.360
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

3871
01:56:58.360 --> 01:56:59.550
<v Speaker 2>there's didn't have feathers.</v>

3872
01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:00.661
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

3873
01:57:00.661 --> 01:57:02.730
<v Speaker 2>at the end of this whole experience of being in London,</v>

3874
01:57:02.731 --> 01:57:07.110
<v Speaker 2>the only thing they wanted to take back was this knowledge of how you put the</v>

3875
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:08.101
<v Speaker 2>feathers on the air.</v>

3876
01:57:08.101 --> 01:57:08.934
<v Speaker 2>They weren't interested in.</v>

3877
01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:09.171
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3878
01:57:09.171 --> 01:57:09.630
<v Speaker 4>At the worlds.</v>

3879
01:57:09.630 --> 01:57:11.850
<v Speaker 4>That story is that London ain't Tahiti,</v>

3880
01:57:18.250 --> 01:57:18.900
<v Speaker 4>Tahiti,</v>

3881
01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:19.621
<v Speaker 4>anthropologists,</v>

3882
01:57:19.621 --> 01:57:20.071
<v Speaker 4>and be like,</v>

3883
01:57:20.071 --> 01:57:20.611
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3884
01:57:20.611 --> 01:57:21.444
<v Speaker 4>they're not going</v>

3885
01:57:24.430 --> 01:57:25.280
<v Speaker 4>to get him on his shit.</v>

3886
01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:28.160
<v Speaker 4>Drunk white leg paper eating fish and chips.</v>

3887
01:57:28.170 --> 01:57:28.440
<v Speaker 4>They're gonna.</v>

3888
01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:30.360
<v Speaker 4>Want to get the fuck out of there as quickly as they got their</v>

3889
01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:33.271
<v Speaker 4>new kitties.</v>

3890
01:57:33.271 --> 01:57:33.691
<v Speaker 4>That trip,</v>

3891
01:57:33.691 --> 01:57:34.524
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3892
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:36.940
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] New Guinea has those semen warriors.</v>

3893
01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:41.040
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the weirdest and I was going to bring that up earlier when we were</v>

3894
01:57:41.041 --> 01:57:46.041
<v Speaker 4>talking about these patterns that sort of develop in these tribal societies.</v>

3895
01:57:47.220 --> 01:57:50.040
<v Speaker 4>One of the most bizarre ones is these,</v>

3896
01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:55.830
<v Speaker 4>they take young boys away from their mother when they're like six or seven and</v>

3897
01:57:56.041 --> 01:58:01.041
<v Speaker 4>they live with men that are the like an anal father and anal son like that's how</v>

3898
01:58:01.441 --> 01:58:01.670
<v Speaker 4>they.</v>

3899
01:58:01.670 --> 01:58:02.170
<v Speaker 4>They they,</v>

3900
01:58:02.170 --> 01:58:07.170
<v Speaker 4>they call it and the man just fucks these kids and they.</v>

3901
01:58:07.631 --> 01:58:12.360
<v Speaker 4>They believe that the kid has to swallow and ingest semen into his body in order</v>

3902
01:58:12.361 --> 01:58:16.320
<v Speaker 4>for him to grow up strong and be a man and that they only use women for,</v>

3903
01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:21.800
<v Speaker 4>for procreation or that this entire culture of thousands of people is wrapped</v>

3904
01:58:23.191 --> 01:58:24.600
<v Speaker 4>around little kids,</v>

3905
01:58:24.601 --> 01:58:27.690
<v Speaker 4>sucking guys dicks to grow old to grow strong.</v>

3906
01:58:28.050 --> 01:58:28.800
<v Speaker 4>Fucking.</v>

3907
01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:29.633
<v Speaker 4>That is.</v>

3908
01:58:29.790 --> 01:58:33.820
<v Speaker 4>That is one of the craziest ones I've ever written or read rather than.</v>

3909
01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:35.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3910
01:58:35.110 --> 01:58:37.620
<v Speaker 4>that somehow or another they convinced thousands of people</v>

3911
01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:40.111
<v Speaker 4>into that one.</v>

3912
01:58:40.111 --> 01:58:41.770
<v Speaker 4>But what's the of that?</v>

3913
01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:42.100
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3914
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:42.660
<v Speaker 6>who knows?</v>

3915
01:58:42.660 --> 01:58:43.010
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3916
01:58:43.010 --> 01:58:44.020
<v Speaker 6>they don't want nobody to know,</v>

3917
01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:46.720
<v Speaker 6>but you find stuff like that motherfucker.</v>

3918
01:58:47.130 --> 01:58:47.963
<v Speaker 6>Just</v>

3919
01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:52.250
<v Speaker 6>one pope can just ruin a whole damn religion.</v>

3920
01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:56.980
<v Speaker 6>Maybe they were missionaries because you know that happened in the Amazon.</v>

3921
01:58:56.981 --> 01:58:59.920
<v Speaker 6>There's a case of Liza was his name.</v>

3922
01:58:59.921 --> 01:59:01.030
<v Speaker 6>He's a French missionary.</v>

3923
01:59:01.031 --> 01:59:01.864
<v Speaker 6>He was the,</v>

3924
01:59:02.170 --> 01:59:03.130
<v Speaker 6>or an anthropologist.</v>

3925
01:59:03.131 --> 01:59:07.510
<v Speaker 6>He wasn't a missionary is an anthropologist who studied under a,</v>

3926
01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:08.470
<v Speaker 6>the great French,</v>

3927
01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:09.820
<v Speaker 6>a Levy Strauss,</v>

3928
01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:15.240
<v Speaker 6>and he went to the Yanomami people in Venezuela and he was fucking all the boys</v>

3929
01:59:17.291 --> 01:59:20.620
<v Speaker 6>and doing all this crazy shit and telling them that this was the way it worked</v>

3930
01:59:20.621 --> 01:59:21.191
<v Speaker 6>in the world.</v>

3931
01:59:21.191 --> 01:59:22.024
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

3932
01:59:22.150 --> 01:59:22.871
<v Speaker 6>he's still there.</v>

3933
01:59:22.871 --> 01:59:24.010
<v Speaker 6>I think he's still alive.</v>

3934
01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:27.310
<v Speaker 6>This part of the whole holy and Shag non situation.</v>

3935
01:59:27.311 --> 01:59:28.630
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if you're familiar with that.</v>

3936
01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:29.921
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3937
01:59:29.921 --> 01:59:32.800
<v Speaker 6>It's very controversial stuff that happened.</v>

3938
01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:33.250
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3939
01:59:33.250 --> 01:59:34.150
<v Speaker 6>Shannon is,</v>

3940
01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:35.740
<v Speaker 6>he wrote the fierce people,</v>

3941
01:59:35.741 --> 01:59:38.380
<v Speaker 6>which is the best selling anthropology book of all time.</v>

3942
01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:41.770
<v Speaker 6>And he was like a Hemingway Kinda guy.</v>

3943
01:59:41.771 --> 01:59:46.090
<v Speaker 6>And he just published a book recently talking about trying to redeem his</v>

3944
01:59:46.091 --> 01:59:50.500
<v Speaker 6>reputation because it turns out like what he did was he went to the Amazon in</v>

3945
01:59:50.501 --> 01:59:51.790
<v Speaker 6>the late sixties,</v>

3946
01:59:52.390 --> 01:59:53.020
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3947
01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:54.310
<v Speaker 6>or the Orinoco really,</v>

3948
01:59:54.311 --> 01:59:56.950
<v Speaker 6>which is a tributary of the Amazon in Venezuela.</v>

3949
01:59:57.340 --> 02:00:01.590
<v Speaker 6>And he was studying the Yanomami people and um,</v>

3950
02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:07.740
<v Speaker 6>he wrote a thesis and calling them the fierce people saying that they,</v>

3951
02:00:07.971 --> 02:00:10.540
<v Speaker 6>they killed each other at such high rates.</v>

3952
02:00:10.541 --> 02:00:15.280
<v Speaker 6>And this justifies this hobbsy and view of the origins of human violence that</v>

3953
02:00:15.281 --> 02:00:19.930
<v Speaker 6>were really nasty and so we need these governments and religions to keep us in</v>

3954
02:00:19.931 --> 02:00:20.591
<v Speaker 6>check and you know,</v>

3955
02:00:20.591 --> 02:00:21.580
<v Speaker 6>it's very political,</v>

3956
02:00:21.581 --> 02:00:21.851
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3957
02:00:21.851 --> 02:00:23.530
<v Speaker 6>But he was just saying it's anthropology,</v>

3958
02:00:24.130 --> 02:00:28.450
<v Speaker 6>but it resonated with the culture of Vietnam was happening and there's all this</v>

3959
02:00:29.230 --> 02:00:30.640
<v Speaker 6>discussion of what,</v>

3960
02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:32.050
<v Speaker 6>why are we violent?</v>

3961
02:00:32.051 --> 02:00:33.040
<v Speaker 6>Is that our nature?</v>

3962
02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:34.660
<v Speaker 6>Or is it institutional,</v>

3963
02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:35.201
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3964
02:00:35.201 --> 02:00:37.750
<v Speaker 6>the whole hippies versus the institution debate.</v>

3965
02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:38.561
<v Speaker 6>So anyway,</v>

3966
02:00:38.561 --> 02:00:42.700
<v Speaker 6>he wrote this book and it was a huge bestseller and he became super famous.</v>

3967
02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:47.020
<v Speaker 6>Turns out that when he went into this area,</v>

3968
02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:52.080
<v Speaker 6>he brought lots of machetes and these people didn't have lots of machetes.</v>

3969
02:00:52.241 --> 02:00:54.310
<v Speaker 6>They didn't have metal tools at all.</v>

3970
02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:58.570
<v Speaker 6>So he brings in the machetes and he starts giving the machetes to certain groups</v>

3971
02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:00.820
<v Speaker 6>in exchange for their cooperation.</v>

3972
02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:05.080
<v Speaker 6>And his research was on a genealogy,</v>

3973
02:01:05.081 --> 02:01:07.570
<v Speaker 6>so he needed to get the names of ancestors.</v>

3974
02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:09.520
<v Speaker 6>But it turns out that the Yanomami,</v>

3975
02:01:09.521 --> 02:01:12.370
<v Speaker 6>it's a great taboo to ever say the name of a dead person.</v>

3976
02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:14.140
<v Speaker 6>So what he would do is say,</v>

3977
02:01:14.141 --> 02:01:14.650
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

3978
02:01:14.650 --> 02:01:18.460
<v Speaker 6>I'll give you this machete if you tell me the names of the father and</v>

3979
02:01:18.461 --> 02:01:22.180
<v Speaker 6>grandfather have that guy from that other village,</v>

3980
02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:26.290
<v Speaker 6>so he would bribe them to get this information,</v>

3981
02:01:26.291 --> 02:01:29.710
<v Speaker 6>but that's a great taboo to say the names of that guy's father or grandfather,</v>

3982
02:01:29.711 --> 02:01:30.430
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3983
02:01:30.430 --> 02:01:34.270
<v Speaker 6>So then he would go to the other village and as a way to confirm whether the</v>

3984
02:01:34.271 --> 02:01:35.680
<v Speaker 6>information was correct,</v>

3985
02:01:35.740 --> 02:01:39.950
<v Speaker 6>he would say so and so over there said your father and grandfather were blah</v>

3986
02:01:39.951 --> 02:01:41.060
<v Speaker 6>blah blah and blah blah blah.</v>

3987
02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:42.440
<v Speaker 6>And if they got really pissed off,</v>

3988
02:01:42.441 --> 02:01:43.610
<v Speaker 6>he knew it was correct.</v>

3989
02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:45.800
<v Speaker 6>So that would confirm his information.</v>

3990
02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:47.750
<v Speaker 6>Then they would break,</v>

3991
02:01:47.810 --> 02:01:50.990
<v Speaker 6>they would have all these wars and they kill each other with these machetes.</v>

3992
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:52.550
<v Speaker 6>And then he reported back saying,</v>

3993
02:01:52.551 --> 02:01:52.701
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3994
02:01:52.701 --> 02:01:57.701
<v Speaker 6>the Yanomami are very fierce destructive war like people and this is the origins</v>

3995
02:01:57.861 --> 02:01:59.210
<v Speaker 6>of humanity and Yada Yada.</v>

3996
02:01:59.211 --> 02:02:01.040
<v Speaker 6>Ya fucking bullshit,</v>

3997
02:02:01.041 --> 02:02:01.790
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3998
02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:02.630
<v Speaker 6>Complete Bullshit.</v>

3999
02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:03.590
<v Speaker 6>That's amazing.</v>

4000
02:02:03.591 --> 02:02:03.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4001
02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:08.330
<v Speaker 6>So there is a book called darkness and El Dorado that came out a few years ago.</v>

4002
02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.750
<v Speaker 6>It was a big bestseller and exposed a lot of this stuff.</v>

4003
02:02:12.170 --> 02:02:15.500
<v Speaker 6>And it also went further and accused him of genocide,</v>

4004
02:02:15.501 --> 02:02:16.370
<v Speaker 6>him and this other guy,</v>

4005
02:02:16.371 --> 02:02:17.204
<v Speaker 6>neal,</v>

4006
02:02:17.630 --> 02:02:22.630
<v Speaker 6>for it accused them of using a vaccination program as a way to sort of test</v>

4007
02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:25.550
<v Speaker 6>immune responses.</v>

4008
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:28.070
<v Speaker 6>And that appears to be for.</v>

4009
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:29.780
<v Speaker 6>That appears to have been true.</v>

4010
02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:30.200
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4011
02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:33.620
<v Speaker 6>But the other stuff with the machetes and sewing violence and all that,</v>

4012
02:02:33.621 --> 02:02:36.430
<v Speaker 6>and then reporting that their station from the other guy.</v>

4013
02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:37.453
<v Speaker 6>The other guy.</v>

4014
02:02:37.530 --> 02:02:37.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4015
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:38.270
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4016
02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:38.840
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>

4017
02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:43.280
<v Speaker 6>About fucking group of victimized people trying to just get along and these</v>

4018
02:02:43.281 --> 02:02:45.230
<v Speaker 6>white people come along and fuck everything up.</v>

4019
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:46.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4020
02:02:46.030 --> 02:02:46.370
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4021
02:02:46.370 --> 02:02:47.190
<v Speaker 6>And they even.</v>

4022
02:02:47.190 --> 02:02:48.380
<v Speaker 6>I write about the insects,</v>

4023
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:50.240
<v Speaker 6>the situation in sex at dawn and they,</v>

4024
02:02:50.241 --> 02:02:52.660
<v Speaker 6>even the Yanomami have a special word called,</v>

4025
02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:53.900
<v Speaker 6>I think it's anthro,</v>

4026
02:02:54.260 --> 02:02:57.740
<v Speaker 6>which means like a crazy destructive white person.</v>

4027
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.420
<v Speaker 6>And so he's not even allowed to go back to Venezuela.</v>

4028
02:03:02.450 --> 02:03:03.920
<v Speaker 6>He's barred from the country.</v>

4029
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:04.810
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

4030
02:03:04.810 --> 02:03:05.320
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4031
02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:05.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4032
02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:07.520
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why I was talking about that.</v>

4033
02:03:07.521 --> 02:03:08.800
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember what 10.</v>

4034
02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:09.561
<v Speaker 6>Doesn't matter.</v>

4035
02:03:09.561 --> 02:03:09.741
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

4036
02:03:09.741 --> 02:03:10.011
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

4037
02:03:10.011 --> 02:03:10.081
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4038
02:03:10.081 --> 02:03:10.490
<v Speaker 6>it's.</v>

4039
02:03:10.490 --> 02:03:10.791
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4040
02:03:10.791 --> 02:03:13.490
<v Speaker 6>it's just the distortion of the,</v>

4041
02:03:13.491 --> 02:03:13.710
<v Speaker 6>our,</v>

4042
02:03:13.710 --> 02:03:16.550
<v Speaker 6>our image of these people and how these crazy cultures can interrupt.</v>

4043
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:20.850
<v Speaker 6>That might've been missionaries that cause these guys to blow all these kids and</v>

4044
02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:21.380
<v Speaker 6>by the time,</v>

4045
02:03:21.380 --> 02:03:21.651
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4046
02:03:21.651 --> 02:03:23.680
<v Speaker 6>that's what I was rather.</v>

4047
02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:24.471
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4048
02:03:24.471 --> 02:03:29.210
<v Speaker 6>you see these interesting sexual practices all over the world and so they,</v>

4049
02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:30.530
<v Speaker 6>a lot of stuffs,</v>

4050
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:31.341
<v Speaker 6>you know that.</v>

4051
02:03:31.341 --> 02:03:34.670
<v Speaker 6>When I was talking about that when last night at a cocktail party in Venice</v>

4052
02:03:34.671 --> 02:03:37.520
<v Speaker 6>actually I was talking with this gay guy and we were talking about how,</v>

4053
02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:38.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4054
02:03:38.050 --> 02:03:40.100
<v Speaker 6>we think we know what it means to be gay,</v>

4055
02:03:40.700 --> 02:03:42.830
<v Speaker 6>but you look at a culture like that and you say,</v>

4056
02:03:42.831 --> 02:03:43.011
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4057
02:03:43.011 --> 02:03:43.844
<v Speaker 6>are they gay?</v>

4058
02:03:44.170 --> 02:03:47.840
<v Speaker 6>I know they consider it to be normal sexual development,</v>

4059
02:03:47.930 --> 02:03:48.890
<v Speaker 6>conventional,</v>

4060
02:03:49.130 --> 02:03:49.341
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4061
02:03:49.341 --> 02:03:49.941
<v Speaker 6>that's what you do.</v>

4062
02:03:49.941 --> 02:03:50.774
<v Speaker 6>Or the Messiah,</v>

4063
02:03:50.780 --> 02:03:51.381
<v Speaker 6>the Messiah,</v>

4064
02:03:51.381 --> 02:03:51.651
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4065
02:03:51.651 --> 02:03:55.370
<v Speaker 6>the herb's herdsmen new drink blood and milk in Kenya.</v>

4066
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:58.700
<v Speaker 6>They have a similar sort of thing where the young,</v>

4067
02:03:58.730 --> 02:04:00.980
<v Speaker 6>younger boys go out on these long,</v>

4068
02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:02.301
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4069
02:04:02.301 --> 02:04:05.270
<v Speaker 6>when they're out with the herds for weeks or months at a time.</v>

4070
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:09.080
<v Speaker 6>They go out with the older boys and the older boys will have sex with them.</v>

4071
02:04:09.110 --> 02:04:10.100
<v Speaker 6>Not Anal sex,</v>

4072
02:04:10.101 --> 02:04:11.690
<v Speaker 6>but they'll um,</v>

4073
02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:15.530
<v Speaker 6>they'll put their penis between the thighs of the younger boy.</v>

4074
02:04:15.650 --> 02:04:16.720
<v Speaker 6>That was how the room is that?</v>

4075
02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:17.630
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4076
02:04:17.630 --> 02:04:18.470
<v Speaker 6>there's a name for that.</v>

4077
02:04:18.471 --> 02:04:20.360
<v Speaker 6>I can't remember the word was specific word for it.</v>

4078
02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:20.781
<v Speaker 6>Either way.</v>

4079
02:04:20.781 --> 02:04:21.614
<v Speaker 6>It's still good.</v>

4080
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:22.430
<v Speaker 6>Let them know.</v>

4081
02:04:22.430 --> 02:04:23.263
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4082
02:04:24.350 --> 02:04:24.921
<v Speaker 6>that's the thing.</v>

4083
02:04:24.921 --> 02:04:26.930
<v Speaker 6>They would say it's not because then they get older.</v>

4084
02:04:26.931 --> 02:04:27.651
<v Speaker 6>They marry a woman.</v>

4085
02:04:27.651 --> 02:04:28.340
<v Speaker 6>They have kids.</v>

4086
02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:30.530
<v Speaker 6>That's just normal growing up.</v>

4087
02:04:30.710 --> 02:04:31.640
<v Speaker 6>Normal fuckery.</v>

4088
02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:32.790
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4089
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:34.000
<v Speaker 6>I'm not.</v>

4090
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:38.190
<v Speaker 6>I think once you know what kind of a effect that has</v>

4091
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:39.240
<v Speaker 4>on the young boys,</v>

4092
02:04:40.050 --> 02:04:40.771
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing.</v>

4093
02:04:40.771 --> 02:04:42.060
<v Speaker 4>If it's considered normal,</v>

4094
02:04:42.061 --> 02:04:44.180
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't knock it until you fight it.</v>

4095
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:45.340
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4096
02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:46.173
<v Speaker 4>how dare you.</v>

4097
02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:47.933
<v Speaker 4>How dare you.</v>

4098
02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:49.460
<v Speaker 4>He was so proud of himself.</v>

4099
02:04:50.070 --> 02:04:52.560
<v Speaker 4>He was hanging out with Hinchcliffe too long.</v>

4100
02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:53.311
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

4101
02:04:53.311 --> 02:04:54.144
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4102
02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:54.720
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4103
02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:58.230
<v Speaker 4>the idea though that it's not going to have an effect is only based on the fact</v>

4104
02:04:58.231 --> 02:05:00.510
<v Speaker 4>that they're going to do it to more young boys and they're not going to</v>

4105
02:05:00.511 --> 02:05:01.344
<v Speaker 4>complain.</v>

4106
02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:01.801
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

4107
02:05:01.801 --> 02:05:02.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4108
02:05:02.190 --> 02:05:07.190
<v Speaker 4>one of the weird things about sexual abuse is that it sort of re re manifests</v>

4109
02:05:07.621 --> 02:05:12.140
<v Speaker 4>itself in the victim and they start to be become a,</v>

4110
02:05:12.450 --> 02:05:13.283
<v Speaker 4>they become</v>

4111
02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:14.290
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4112
02:05:14.290 --> 02:05:15.040
<v Speaker 2>the accuser.</v>

4113
02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:15.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4114
02:05:15.230 --> 02:05:15.311
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4115
02:05:15.311 --> 02:05:16.750
<v Speaker 2>they also become the perpetrator.</v>

4116
02:05:16.751 --> 02:05:17.270
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

4117
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:18.220
<v Speaker 2>in fact that,</v>

4118
02:05:18.221 --> 02:05:21.110
<v Speaker 2>that a guy I was speaking to recently</v>

4119
02:05:22.610 --> 02:05:24.170
<v Speaker 2>who identifies as gay,</v>

4120
02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:25.160
<v Speaker 2>he said to me,</v>

4121
02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:27.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I was born gay.</v>

4122
02:05:27.110 --> 02:05:31.280
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm gay because I was sexually abused as a child by my stepfather from</v>

4123
02:05:31.281 --> 02:05:32.420
<v Speaker 2>the time I was three.</v>

4124
02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:36.170
<v Speaker 2>And we got into this whole discussion of how,</v>

4125
02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:37.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4126
02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:37.360
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4127
02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:41.930
<v Speaker 2>there's the term erotic plasticity and how different it is for men and women in</v>

4128
02:05:41.931 --> 02:05:43.790
<v Speaker 2>men and males have other mammals.</v>

4129
02:05:44.090 --> 02:05:49.090
<v Speaker 2>There seems to be a developmental window where we imprint something and that</v>

4130
02:05:52.401 --> 02:05:56.150
<v Speaker 2>window closes and if you got an imprint that sticks with you for life,</v>

4131
02:05:56.151 --> 02:05:58.970
<v Speaker 2>which is why virtually all fetishist sermon,</v>

4132
02:05:59.510 --> 02:06:00.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4133
02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:01.430
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of men who will say,</v>

4134
02:06:01.431 --> 02:06:01.641
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4135
02:06:01.641 --> 02:06:03.350
<v Speaker 2>I can't get off unless you know,</v>

4136
02:06:03.351 --> 02:06:06.080
<v Speaker 2>there's latex or she's wearing red high heeled shoes,</v>

4137
02:06:06.081 --> 02:06:07.100
<v Speaker 2>or she's got this or that.</v>

4138
02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4139
02:06:07.700 --> 02:06:08.091
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

4140
02:06:08.091 --> 02:06:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Women don't say that like women,</v>

4141
02:06:09.890 --> 02:06:10.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4142
02:06:10.131 --> 02:06:13.010
<v Speaker 2>they're much more flexible and adapt to the situation.</v>

4143
02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:18.580
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is that if during that window you're imprinted with male,</v>

4144
02:06:18.891 --> 02:06:21.500
<v Speaker 2>male sex and pleasure involved with that,</v>

4145
02:06:22.040 --> 02:06:27.040
<v Speaker 2>then you could sort of like have that as a fetish even though you were born,</v>

4146
02:06:29.361 --> 02:06:29.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4147
02:06:29.601 --> 02:06:32.870
<v Speaker 2>you're sort of genetic components or your brain development or whatever.</v>

4148
02:06:32.871 --> 02:06:35.150
<v Speaker 2>There are different theories is heterosexual.</v>

4149
02:06:35.570 --> 02:06:36.650
<v Speaker 2>So there are different.</v>

4150
02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:38.300
<v Speaker 2>According to this idea,</v>

4151
02:06:38.340 --> 02:06:40.730
<v Speaker 2>there are different ways to be gay.</v>

4152
02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:42.770
<v Speaker 2>You can be born gay or you could be,</v>

4153
02:06:43.130 --> 02:06:45.680
<v Speaker 2>you could be gay as a fetish in a way,</v>

4154
02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:46.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4155
02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:47.001
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

4156
02:06:47.001 --> 02:06:48.860
<v Speaker 2>related to what you were saying about the trauma,</v>

4157
02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:54.310
<v Speaker 2>there's research showing that what really causes the trauma is the shame</v>

4158
02:06:55.881 --> 02:07:00.881
<v Speaker 2>generated by the culture that boys who are what we would call sexually abused or</v>

4159
02:07:01.851 --> 02:07:04.610
<v Speaker 2>girls who were sexually abused at a young age.</v>

4160
02:07:05.150 --> 02:07:05.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4161
02:07:05.570 --> 02:07:07.340
<v Speaker 2>if there's not pain involved,</v>

4162
02:07:07.341 --> 02:07:07.581
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4163
02:07:07.581 --> 02:07:10.040
<v Speaker 2>If it's inappropriate touching or whatever,</v>

4164
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:11.303
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4165
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:16.070
<v Speaker 2>the trauma comes about when they're told that was really bad and they're told</v>

4166
02:07:16.071 --> 02:07:17.690
<v Speaker 2>that that's a horrible thing that happened.</v>

4167
02:07:18.170 --> 02:07:21.950
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't necessarily come about from the experience itself.</v>

4168
02:07:21.951 --> 02:07:24.260
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean this as to justify anything or</v>

4169
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:27.990
<v Speaker 4>aren't there a variety of different types of experiences?</v>

4170
02:07:28.110 --> 02:07:33.110
<v Speaker 4>Are these consensual and just innocent or are these actual hold you down?</v>

4171
02:07:33.590 --> 02:07:34.290
<v Speaker 4>Rape.</v>

4172
02:07:34.290 --> 02:07:35.123
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4173
02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 4>It's physical</v>

4174
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:36.340
<v Speaker 6>pains,</v>

4175
02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:37.173
<v Speaker 6>a whole different thing.</v>

4176
02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:40.150
<v Speaker 6>If it's just two little kids diddling each other,</v>

4177
02:07:40.930 --> 02:07:41.440
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4178
02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:43.540
<v Speaker 6>some mothers would say that's abuse.</v>

4179
02:07:43.570 --> 02:07:44.321
<v Speaker 6>That's a horrible,</v>

4180
02:07:44.321 --> 02:07:44.861
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

4181
02:07:44.861 --> 02:07:45.371
<v Speaker 6>what happened?</v>

4182
02:07:45.371 --> 02:07:46.660
<v Speaker 6>The best thing to do is just say,</v>

4183
02:07:46.690 --> 02:07:46.901
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

4184
02:07:46.901 --> 02:07:47.650
<v Speaker 6>nothing happened.</v>

4185
02:07:47.650 --> 02:07:47.981
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4186
02:07:47.981 --> 02:07:48.970
<v Speaker 6>it's no big deal.</v>

4187
02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:49.890
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4188
02:07:49.890 --> 02:07:50.650
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4189
02:07:50.650 --> 02:07:55.650
<v Speaker 6>and there are psychological studies showing that the lasting effects are</v>

4190
02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:57.760
<v Speaker 6>negligible and less.</v>

4191
02:07:58.030 --> 02:07:59.470
<v Speaker 6>It's framed as,</v>

4192
02:07:59.471 --> 02:08:00.251
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

4193
02:08:00.251 --> 02:08:00.920
<v Speaker 6>what happened?</v>

4194
02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:02.050
<v Speaker 6>That completely makes sense.</v>

4195
02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:04.030
<v Speaker 6>As does the framing thing,</v>

4196
02:08:04.031 --> 02:08:06.100
<v Speaker 6>the framing thing completely makes sense as well,</v>

4197
02:08:06.101 --> 02:08:10.780
<v Speaker 6>that there's something happens in their life and they just get imprinted and</v>

4198
02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:13.180
<v Speaker 6>that's been otherwise,</v>

4199
02:08:13.300 --> 02:08:18.300
<v Speaker 6>why would so many abuse victims become abusers themselves?</v>

4200
02:08:18.521 --> 02:08:20.640
<v Speaker 6>You would think that like you,</v>

4201
02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:24.040
<v Speaker 6>the last thing you would do is repeat that,</v>

4202
02:08:24.100 --> 02:08:24.460
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4203
02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:24.941
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>

4204
02:08:24.941 --> 02:08:27.170
<v Speaker 6>that's the thing that fucked you up and ruined you.</v>

4205
02:08:27.180 --> 02:08:27.820
<v Speaker 6>You would say like,</v>

4206
02:08:27.820 --> 02:08:28.091
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

4207
02:08:28.091 --> 02:08:31.540
<v Speaker 6>I would never want to do this to another person and that would be how would we</v>

4208
02:08:31.541 --> 02:08:32.200
<v Speaker 6>would evolve.</v>

4209
02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:36.070
<v Speaker 6>So it seems like there's like a hitch in the developmental process that allows</v>

4210
02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:40.000
<v Speaker 6>weird things just to be accepted and become the standard,</v>

4211
02:08:40.001 --> 02:08:40.450
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4212
02:08:40.450 --> 02:08:45.450
<v Speaker 6>They become eroticized and associated with pleasure and so you try to relive</v>

4213
02:08:46.361 --> 02:08:47.230
<v Speaker 6>them later.</v>

4214
02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:49.290
<v Speaker 6>There's a great experiment with,</v>

4215
02:08:49.310 --> 02:08:50.080
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4216
02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:53.710
<v Speaker 6>it happened in Scotland I think where they took a one year,</v>

4217
02:08:53.711 --> 02:08:57.430
<v Speaker 6>they had like a herd of goats and a herd of sheep and so they took all the</v>

4218
02:08:57.431 --> 02:08:58.330
<v Speaker 6>babies,</v>

4219
02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:02.470
<v Speaker 6>all the baby goats and put them with the sheep and they took all the baby sheep</v>

4220
02:09:02.471 --> 02:09:03.580
<v Speaker 6>and put them with the goats.</v>

4221
02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:07.300
<v Speaker 6>So they were raised thinking they were the other species,</v>

4222
02:09:07.630 --> 02:09:08.350
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4223
02:09:08.350 --> 02:09:11.560
<v Speaker 6>So all the goats grew up around the sheep thinking I'm just a weird looking</v>

4224
02:09:11.561 --> 02:09:11.891
<v Speaker 6>cheap.</v>

4225
02:09:11.891 --> 02:09:12.161
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4226
02:09:12.161 --> 02:09:13.390
<v Speaker 6>And the vice versa.</v>

4227
02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:17.950
<v Speaker 6>So the way till they got sexually mature and started having sex and then they</v>

4228
02:09:17.951 --> 02:09:18.880
<v Speaker 6>switched them back.</v>

4229
02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:24.600
<v Speaker 6>And what happened was that the males refused to have sex with their own species</v>

4230
02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:29.770
<v Speaker 6>because they had learned that none of the male goats and learn like I fuck</v>

4231
02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:30.973
<v Speaker 6>sheep.</v>

4232
02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:31.570
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4233
02:09:31.570 --> 02:09:32.403
<v Speaker 6>I fucked goats.</v>

4234
02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:33.490
<v Speaker 6>The females were like,</v>

4235
02:09:33.491 --> 02:09:33.671
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4236
02:09:33.671 --> 02:09:34.504
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

4237
02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:35.171
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4238
02:09:35.171 --> 02:09:36.850
<v Speaker 6>they just sort of like went with it.</v>

4239
02:09:37.210 --> 02:09:38.470
<v Speaker 6>But the males refused.</v>

4240
02:09:38.471 --> 02:09:40.690
<v Speaker 6>They were stuck with it because they were imprinted.</v>

4241
02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:41.440
<v Speaker 6>And that was it.</v>

4242
02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:42.670
<v Speaker 6>That is fascinating.</v>

4243
02:09:42.671 --> 02:09:43.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4244
02:09:43.180 --> 02:09:43.870
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck,</v>

4245
02:09:43.870 --> 02:09:45.640
<v Speaker 6>evolutionary purposes that play.</v>

4246
02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:46.541
<v Speaker 6>Who knows?</v>

4247
02:09:46.541 --> 02:09:47.440
<v Speaker 6>That's a good question.</v>

4248
02:09:48.010 --> 02:09:48.491
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

4249
02:09:48.491 --> 02:09:48.820
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>

4250
02:09:48.820 --> 02:09:51.850
<v Speaker 6>it's a common mistake I would say in,</v>

4251
02:09:51.930 --> 02:09:56.020
<v Speaker 6>and I'm not saying just among people reading books for the first time among</v>

4252
02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:57.011
<v Speaker 6>experts,</v>

4253
02:09:57.011 --> 02:10:01.230
<v Speaker 6>there's a mistake of thinking that everything has an evolutionary function.</v>

4254
02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:03.490
<v Speaker 6>I say sometimes it could just be the,</v>

4255
02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:06.140
<v Speaker 6>the tide went that way and that's what happened.</v>

4256
02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:07.030
<v Speaker 6>And there's a,</v>

4257
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:08.830
<v Speaker 6>there's something Stephen Jay Gould,</v>

4258
02:10:08.831 --> 02:10:11.440
<v Speaker 6>the great evolutionary theorist called spandrels,</v>

4259
02:10:11.441 --> 02:10:15.880
<v Speaker 6>which are things that look like they have a function,</v>

4260
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:18.940
<v Speaker 6>but they're actually sort of a side effect of something else.</v>

4261
02:10:19.690 --> 02:10:20.171
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4262
02:10:20.171 --> 02:10:21.190
<v Speaker 6>like the chin,</v>

4263
02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:21.581
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4264
02:10:21.581 --> 02:10:23.350
<v Speaker 6>why did the Chin evolved the way it did?</v>

4265
02:10:23.530 --> 02:10:24.280
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4266
02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:26.500
<v Speaker 6>we have a word for this thing we call the chin,</v>

4267
02:10:26.530 --> 02:10:28.060
<v Speaker 6>but it's not actually a thing.</v>

4268
02:10:28.061 --> 02:10:29.950
<v Speaker 6>It's where the two jawbones fuse,</v>

4269
02:10:30.370 --> 02:10:31.280
<v Speaker 6>so it's,</v>

4270
02:10:31.450 --> 02:10:32.050
<v Speaker 6>it does,</v>

4271
02:10:32.050 --> 02:10:32.351
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4272
02:10:32.351 --> 02:10:34.180
<v Speaker 6>it exists as linguistic concept,</v>

4273
02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:36.730
<v Speaker 2>but not necessarily as a biological concept.</v>

4274
02:10:37.210 --> 02:10:38.010
<v Speaker 2>So they're,</v>

4275
02:10:38.010 --> 02:10:39.100
<v Speaker 2>they're weird,</v>

4276
02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:40.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4277
02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:41.890
<v Speaker 2>they're murky waters.</v>

4278
02:10:41.891 --> 02:10:45.040
<v Speaker 2>You can get lost and when you're looking at evolutionary stuff,</v>

4279
02:10:45.490 --> 02:10:48.160
<v Speaker 2>and he always advised people.</v>

4280
02:10:48.161 --> 02:10:48.971
<v Speaker 2>You always say,</v>

4281
02:10:48.971 --> 02:10:50.500
<v Speaker 2>what's the evolutionary function of that?</v>

4282
02:10:50.501 --> 02:10:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Be Clear on what that is and that it actually would necessarily have an</v>

4283
02:10:55.271 --> 02:10:56.440
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary function.</v>

4284
02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:57.393
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4285
02:10:57.740 --> 02:11:02.740
<v Speaker 5>I've always been fascinated by why at the same time all over the world,</v>

4286
02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:07.880
<v Speaker 5>people who are human beings or you can breed with each other but have such</v>

4287
02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:12.940
<v Speaker 5>incredibly varied ways of behaving and that this has always been this way.</v>

4288
02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:14.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm really into this.</v>

4289
02:11:14.781 --> 02:11:16.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm Dan Carlin,</v>

4290
02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:17.510
<v Speaker 5>a podcast recently.</v>

4291
02:11:17.810 --> 02:11:22.810
<v Speaker 5>He's got this podcast called hardcore history and he does this really detailed</v>

4292
02:11:22.821 --> 02:11:25.490
<v Speaker 5>history of the Mongols over like five,</v>

4293
02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:28.250
<v Speaker 5>five episodes and it's amazing.</v>

4294
02:11:28.850 --> 02:11:30.110
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

4295
02:11:30.111 --> 02:11:32.180
<v Speaker 5>It's just fucking craziness.</v>

4296
02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:37.360
<v Speaker 5>The way these people just took over Europe and just conquered and just the</v>

4297
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:42.430
<v Speaker 5>madness and the how they were so different from anyone that existed at that time</v>

4298
02:11:43.820 --> 02:11:45.800
<v Speaker 5>and that they were so extreme and intense,</v>

4299
02:11:45.860 --> 02:11:49.550
<v Speaker 5>but at the same time that they lived somewhere in the Amazon,</v>

4300
02:11:49.551 --> 02:11:53.120
<v Speaker 5>there are a bunch of people do an Iowaska eating fish and you know,</v>

4301
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:58.510
<v Speaker 5>polyamorous people and it's amazing that this all took place all along.</v>

4302
02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:00.560
<v Speaker 5>And during the same time.</v>

4303
02:12:00.770 --> 02:12:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever read the travels of Marco Polo?</v>

4304
02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:03.790
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4305
02:12:03.790 --> 02:12:04.740
<v Speaker 2>You know the story.</v>

4306
02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:08.750
<v Speaker 2>He's like 14 hundreds or something like that at 13 hundreds.</v>

4307
02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:10.250
<v Speaker 2>And he went to.</v>

4308
02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:15.280
<v Speaker 2>He was with the Mongols and he walked all across Asia on the spice route with</v>

4309
02:12:16.611 --> 02:12:17.444
<v Speaker 2>his uncles.</v>

4310
02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:18.590
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

4311
02:12:18.650 --> 02:12:18.921
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4312
02:12:18.921 --> 02:12:20.090
<v Speaker 2>he was with a,</v>

4313
02:12:20.091 --> 02:12:22.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was gang con or Kubelet icon or which,</v>

4314
02:12:22.941 --> 02:12:25.370
<v Speaker 2>which of the Mongo kings it was.</v>

4315
02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:28.490
<v Speaker 2>And along the way talking about interesting people,</v>

4316
02:12:28.491 --> 02:12:29.640
<v Speaker 2>he stayed with the most.</v>

4317
02:12:29.641 --> 02:12:29.871
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4318
02:12:29.871 --> 02:12:34.871
<v Speaker 2>people of southwestern China who still exists and uh,</v>

4319
02:12:35.061 --> 02:12:39.260
<v Speaker 2>apparently still have this very interesting marital,</v>

4320
02:12:39.261 --> 02:12:39.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4321
02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:44.560
<v Speaker 2>not even marital sexual behavior where both men and women are completely</v>

4322
02:12:46.371 --> 02:12:46.971
<v Speaker 2>autonomous.</v>

4323
02:12:46.971 --> 02:12:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Sexual beings,</v>

4324
02:12:47.841 --> 02:12:49.160
<v Speaker 2>you have sex with whomever you want.</v>

4325
02:12:49.161 --> 02:12:50.450
<v Speaker 2>There's no slut shaming,</v>

4326
02:12:50.451 --> 02:12:52.640
<v Speaker 2>there's no shame involved with multiple partners.</v>

4327
02:12:52.641 --> 02:12:53.211
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you do,</v>

4328
02:12:53.211 --> 02:12:54.044
<v Speaker 2>what you want.</v>

4329
02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:56.480
<v Speaker 2>When a girl becomes sexually mature,</v>

4330
02:12:56.481 --> 02:13:00.800
<v Speaker 2>she gets her own room called a flower room that has a door that opens into the</v>

4331
02:13:00.801 --> 02:13:05.270
<v Speaker 2>central courtyard of her mother's house where she lives and also has a door that</v>

4332
02:13:05.271 --> 02:13:06.470
<v Speaker 2>opens into the street.</v>

4333
02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:08.390
<v Speaker 2>And so that girl from,</v>

4334
02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:08.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4335
02:13:08.631 --> 02:13:09.111
<v Speaker 2>13,</v>

4336
02:13:09.111 --> 02:13:09.591
<v Speaker 2>14,</v>

4337
02:13:09.591 --> 02:13:10.011
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

4338
02:13:10.011 --> 02:13:11.060
<v Speaker 2>sexual maturity,</v>

4339
02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:12.920
<v Speaker 2>she can let anyone.</v>

4340
02:13:12.921 --> 02:13:15.560
<v Speaker 2>She wants to come in and spend the night in her room with her.</v>

4341
02:13:15.950 --> 02:13:18.680
<v Speaker 2>The only rule is he can't be there for breakfast,</v>

4342
02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:19.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4343
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:20.031
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>

4344
02:13:20.031 --> 02:13:20.421
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4345
02:13:20.421 --> 02:13:21.710
<v Speaker 2>nobody's invited for breakfast,</v>

4346
02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:23.030
<v Speaker 2>get get out by sunrise,</v>

4347
02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:25.850
<v Speaker 2>but she can sleep with whoever she wants.</v>

4348
02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Then what happens when she gets pregnant is that the child is cared for by</v>

4349
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:34.440
<v Speaker 6>her brothers and her sisters.</v>

4350
02:13:34.770 --> 02:13:36.240
<v Speaker 6>So as a man,</v>

4351
02:13:36.241 --> 02:13:39.750
<v Speaker 6>your paternal responsibility is to your sister's kids,</v>

4352
02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:42.150
<v Speaker 6>not to your biological child.</v>

4353
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.961
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

4354
02:13:42.961 --> 02:13:44.910
<v Speaker 6>biological fatherhood is,</v>

4355
02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:45.460
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

4356
02:13:45.460 --> 02:13:47.610
<v Speaker 6>is a nonissue in this society is amazing.</v>

4357
02:13:47.970 --> 02:13:48.241
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4358
02:13:48.241 --> 02:13:49.650
<v Speaker 6>Really interesting society.</v>

4359
02:13:50.070 --> 02:13:50.550
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

4360
02:13:50.550 --> 02:13:51.430
<v Speaker 6>it's the law in,</v>

4361
02:13:51.550 --> 02:13:52.610
<v Speaker 6>in um,</v>

4362
02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:57.720
<v Speaker 6>Marco Polo stayed with them and he wrote about them and he thought typical</v>

4363
02:13:57.721 --> 02:13:58.201
<v Speaker 6>Italian,</v>

4364
02:13:58.201 --> 02:13:58.351
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4365
02:13:58.351 --> 02:14:01.950
<v Speaker 6>He thought that he was screwing these women behind the men's backs and,</v>

4366
02:14:01.951 --> 02:14:02.280
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4367
02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:05.150
<v Speaker 6>play Marco polos getting he was getting.</v>

4368
02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:06.480
<v Speaker 6>So he just thought he was slick.</v>

4369
02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:08.100
<v Speaker 6>He thought he was a cool guy,</v>

4370
02:14:08.101 --> 02:14:09.720
<v Speaker 6>but it turns out the women were just like,</v>

4371
02:14:09.930 --> 02:14:10.763
<v Speaker 6>Yo,</v>

4372
02:14:12.330 --> 02:14:13.163
<v Speaker 6>that's funny.</v>

4373
02:14:14.410 --> 02:14:15.370
<v Speaker 5>It is amazing.</v>

4374
02:14:15.371 --> 02:14:17.230
<v Speaker 5>When you think about the variables,</v>

4375
02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:21.730
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing when you think about the variety of different cultures that evolve</v>

4376
02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:26.760
<v Speaker 5>simultaneously over the world and how is it their environment that causes that?</v>

4377
02:14:27.101 --> 02:14:27.701
<v Speaker 5>Or is it,</v>

4378
02:14:27.701 --> 02:14:30.730
<v Speaker 5>this is a missionaries move in and give them machetes and talk about their</v>

4379
02:14:30.731 --> 02:14:31.251
<v Speaker 5>ancestors.</v>

4380
02:14:31.251 --> 02:14:33.170
<v Speaker 5>I mean the various,</v>

4381
02:14:33.370 --> 02:14:34.960
<v Speaker 5>the various things that happen or.</v>

4382
02:14:34.961 --> 02:14:35.361
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

4383
02:14:35.361 --> 02:14:36.194
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4384
02:14:36.410 --> 02:14:37.870
<v Speaker 5>and I know I confuse those two stores.</v>

4385
02:14:37.871 --> 02:14:38.980
<v Speaker 5>The missionary and the researcher.</v>

4386
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:39.340
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4387
02:14:39.340 --> 02:14:40.270
<v Speaker 6>it's all you mean.</v>

4388
02:14:40.450 --> 02:14:40.831
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4389
02:14:40.831 --> 02:14:45.680
<v Speaker 6>And smallpox comes in and then you get the ice ages and you know,</v>

4390
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.740
<v Speaker 6>but I,</v>

4391
02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:47.250
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4392
02:14:47.250 --> 02:14:48.930
<v Speaker 6>I tend to be a materialist.</v>

4393
02:14:48.931 --> 02:14:53.070
<v Speaker 6>There's a book called cultural materialism by Marvin Harris,</v>

4394
02:14:53.071 --> 02:14:54.210
<v Speaker 6>which is a great book.</v>

4395
02:14:54.211 --> 02:14:57.090
<v Speaker 6>And he wrote a more popular book called Cannibals and Kings,</v>

4396
02:14:57.091 --> 02:14:58.590
<v Speaker 6>which covers some of the same stuff.</v>

4397
02:14:59.040 --> 02:14:59.873
<v Speaker 6>And He,</v>

4398
02:14:59.940 --> 02:15:00.121
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4399
02:15:00.121 --> 02:15:05.121
<v Speaker 6>he looked at things like why are some societies cannibals and others aren't,</v>

4400
02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:05.851
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

4401
02:15:05.851 --> 02:15:06.601
<v Speaker 6>So you've got the,</v>

4402
02:15:06.601 --> 02:15:06.820
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4403
02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:10.500
<v Speaker 6>the clash of European societies and the Aztecs and the mind and all that.</v>

4404
02:15:10.830 --> 02:15:11.663
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

4405
02:15:11.850 --> 02:15:12.071
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4406
02:15:12.071 --> 02:15:14.640
<v Speaker 6>you can't say the Europeans weren't blood thirsty,</v>

4407
02:15:14.670 --> 02:15:15.390
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4408
02:15:15.390 --> 02:15:16.860
<v Speaker 6>crazy killers.</v>

4409
02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:19.680
<v Speaker 6>They just didn't eat what they killed the people they killed.</v>

4410
02:15:19.681 --> 02:15:22.620
<v Speaker 6>Whereas the Aztecs were killing the people that are eating the people they</v>

4411
02:15:22.621 --> 02:15:23.070
<v Speaker 6>killed.</v>

4412
02:15:23.070 --> 02:15:23.851
<v Speaker 6>Why is that?</v>

4413
02:15:23.851 --> 02:15:27.720
<v Speaker 6>Or why on some South Pacific islands where the people cannibalistic and others,</v>

4414
02:15:27.721 --> 02:15:28.560
<v Speaker 6>they weren't right.</v>

4415
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:30.270
<v Speaker 6>So what he did was he did a,</v>

4416
02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:32.430
<v Speaker 6>a materialistic analysis.</v>

4417
02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:37.640
<v Speaker 6>And what he found was that without exception in the societies that were</v>

4418
02:15:37.921 --> 02:15:38.910
<v Speaker 6>cannibalistic,</v>

4419
02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:44.180
<v Speaker 6>there was no other source of protein that didn't compete with humans for the</v>

4420
02:15:44.701 --> 02:15:45.534
<v Speaker 6>same food.</v>

4421
02:15:45.870 --> 02:15:47.700
<v Speaker 6>So like they didn't have pigs,</v>

4422
02:15:47.770 --> 02:15:48.180
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4423
02:15:48.180 --> 02:15:49.020
<v Speaker 6>Pigs will eat stuff.</v>

4424
02:15:49.021 --> 02:15:49.430
<v Speaker 6>Humans,</v>

4425
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:50.263
<v Speaker 6>canny,</v>

4426
02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:51.030
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4427
02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:54.840
<v Speaker 6>So you can raise pigs without feeding them your own food.</v>

4428
02:15:54.841 --> 02:15:55.591
<v Speaker 6>But dogs,</v>

4429
02:15:55.591 --> 02:15:58.230
<v Speaker 6>you feed them stuff you would eat because dogs eat meat.</v>

4430
02:15:58.320 --> 02:15:59.070
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4431
02:15:59.070 --> 02:16:02.970
<v Speaker 6>So in Mexico there was nothing that they could raise,</v>

4432
02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:03.540
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4433
02:16:03.540 --> 02:16:03.950
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4434
02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:07.560
<v Speaker 6>no animal that could be domesticated that they could raise for meat.</v>

4435
02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:11.990
<v Speaker 6>And so that's why they eat the dead people because they were protein starved.</v>

4436
02:16:12.150 --> 02:16:13.040
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

4437
02:16:13.620 --> 02:16:16.650
<v Speaker 6>And then you apply that same thing to the different islands in the South Pacific</v>

4438
02:16:16.651 --> 02:16:17.484
<v Speaker 6>and he found the same.</v>

4439
02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:18.750
<v Speaker 5>And American Indians,</v>

4440
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:21.780
<v Speaker 5>native Americans in the harshest climates were the ones that we're tending</v>

4441
02:16:21.781 --> 02:16:23.940
<v Speaker 5>towards cannibalism like towards the Great Lakes,</v>

4442
02:16:23.941 --> 02:16:24.391
<v Speaker 5>like the,</v>

4443
02:16:24.391 --> 02:16:24.591
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4444
02:16:24.591 --> 02:16:26.820
<v Speaker 5>the native American people from the Great Lakes area.</v>

4445
02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:28.170
<v Speaker 5>Those are the ones that,</v>

4446
02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:28.450
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4447
02:16:28.450 --> 02:16:28.840
<v Speaker 5>there's uh,</v>

4448
02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:29.673
<v Speaker 5>stories of</v>

4449
02:16:30.060 --> 02:16:31.030
<v Speaker 4>cannibalizing people.</v>

4450
02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:31.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4451
02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:32.111
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4452
02:16:32.111 --> 02:16:33.000
<v Speaker 4>And you also have.</v>

4453
02:16:34.310 --> 02:16:34.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4454
02:16:34.830 --> 02:16:36.130
<v Speaker 4>in Midwinter Yeah,</v>

4455
02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:36.880
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

4456
02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:37.551
<v Speaker 4>But also in,</v>

4457
02:16:37.551 --> 02:16:38.590
<v Speaker 4>in that kind of thing,</v>

4458
02:16:38.591 --> 02:16:42.040
<v Speaker 4>you want to look at ritualistic cannibalism versus like,</v>

4459
02:16:42.041 --> 02:16:42.461
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4460
02:16:42.461 --> 02:16:43.181
<v Speaker 4>dinner time,</v>

4461
02:16:43.181 --> 02:16:44.014
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4462
02:16:44.170 --> 02:16:44.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4463
02:16:44.590 --> 02:16:44.911
<v Speaker 4>Because they,</v>

4464
02:16:44.911 --> 02:16:49.630
<v Speaker 4>they had some interesting torture ceremonies as well in those Canadian Great</v>

4465
02:16:49.631 --> 02:16:50.650
<v Speaker 4>Lakes Iroquois,</v>

4466
02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:52.360
<v Speaker 4>kind of that.</v>

4467
02:16:52.390 --> 02:16:54.220
<v Speaker 4>It was an honor to be tortured to death.</v>

4468
02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:54.611
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4469
02:16:54.611 --> 02:16:55.400
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

4470
02:16:55.400 --> 02:16:56.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4471
02:16:56.180 --> 02:16:56.590
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

4472
02:16:56.590 --> 02:16:56.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4473
02:16:56.740 --> 02:16:58.720
<v Speaker 4>Steven Rinella guy that I was telling you about,</v>

4474
02:16:58.721 --> 02:16:59.620
<v Speaker 4>his book mediator,</v>

4475
02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:00.790
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4476
02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:05.790
<v Speaker 4>he told me some crazy stories about the people that lived off the Missouri,</v>

4477
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:07.870
<v Speaker 4>the Missouri River,</v>

4478
02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:12.280
<v Speaker 4>like in Montana and trappers and all these different people that have these</v>

4479
02:17:12.281 --> 02:17:14.200
<v Speaker 4>conflicts with the Indians and other would kill them.</v>

4480
02:17:14.201 --> 02:17:16.510
<v Speaker 4>And there was a lot of cannibalism going on,</v>

4481
02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:18.940
<v Speaker 4>a lot more than I would've ever imagined.</v>

4482
02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:21.700
<v Speaker 4>It's because that's not really something that gets brought up in high school</v>

4483
02:17:21.701 --> 02:17:22.870
<v Speaker 4>history or you know,</v>

4484
02:17:23.020 --> 02:17:23.341
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>

4485
02:17:23.341 --> 02:17:24.340
<v Speaker 4>they don't really tell you,</v>

4486
02:17:24.341 --> 02:17:25.180
<v Speaker 4>oh by the way,</v>

4487
02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:29.220
<v Speaker 4>occasionally used to eat people as did the settlers and our,</v>

4488
02:17:29.470 --> 02:17:29.831
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4489
02:17:29.831 --> 02:17:31.180
<v Speaker 4>the Donner Party,</v>

4490
02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:36.300
<v Speaker 4>North America itself is one of the most spectacular examples of how quickly</v>

4491
02:17:37.181 --> 02:17:38.050
<v Speaker 4>things can change.</v>

4492
02:17:38.410 --> 02:17:38.920
<v Speaker 4>You're right,</v>

4493
02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:41.830
<v Speaker 4>if you stop and think about North America just a thousand years ago,</v>

4494
02:17:41.890 --> 02:17:44.560
<v Speaker 4>just $1,000 anywhere in Europe.</v>

4495
02:17:44.561 --> 02:17:45.220
<v Speaker 4>1,000.</v>

4496
02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:46.450
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's still people,</v>

4497
02:17:46.451 --> 02:17:47.050
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4498
02:17:47.050 --> 02:17:48.520
<v Speaker 4>they're still the nuttiness.</v>

4499
02:17:48.521 --> 02:17:49.240
<v Speaker 4>There's still.</v>

4500
02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:51.910
<v Speaker 4>I've hung out in bars that were more than a thousand years old,</v>

4501
02:17:51.970 --> 02:17:52.481
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

4502
02:17:52.481 --> 02:17:53.800
<v Speaker 4>What is the oldest bar in,</v>

4503
02:17:53.801 --> 02:17:54.080
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4504
02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:55.930
<v Speaker 4>in London as they're like a bar.</v>

4505
02:17:55.931 --> 02:17:57.130
<v Speaker 4>That's when like the fucking,</v>

4506
02:17:57.640 --> 02:17:58.030
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

4507
02:17:58.030 --> 02:17:58.960
<v Speaker 4>Barcelona,</v>

4508
02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:00.910
<v Speaker 4>I could take you to them.</v>

4509
02:18:00.940 --> 02:18:01.360
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4510
02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:02.210
<v Speaker 4>how old are below them?</v>

4511
02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:03.011
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4512
02:18:03.011 --> 02:18:08.011
<v Speaker 4>the oldest continually open bar is from the 1700 I made.</v>

4513
02:18:08.630 --> 02:18:11.170
<v Speaker 4>I'll bother and I've been there many times.</v>

4514
02:18:12.040 --> 02:18:13.740
<v Speaker 4>But the place I'm thinking of when,</v>

4515
02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:15.580
<v Speaker 4>when I've said the thousand years old,</v>

4516
02:18:15.581 --> 02:18:20.581
<v Speaker 4>it's a bar down in the Gulf decaux section of Barcelona where one wall of the</v>

4517
02:18:20.711 --> 02:18:25.210
<v Speaker 4>bar is a Roman wall from the original Roman building that was there.</v>

4518
02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:28.990
<v Speaker 4>So you're like leaning up against the Romans while drinking your beer.</v>

4519
02:18:28.990 --> 02:18:29.950
<v Speaker 4>It's really cool.</v>

4520
02:18:29.980 --> 02:18:31.420
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

4521
02:18:32.650 --> 02:18:33.483
<v Speaker 4>Not America.</v>

4522
02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:36.880
<v Speaker 4>And that's 2000 years old a thousand years ago.</v>

4523
02:18:36.910 --> 02:18:37.990
<v Speaker 4>No Manhattan,</v>

4524
02:18:38.020 --> 02:18:39.430
<v Speaker 4>no Los Angeles,</v>

4525
02:18:39.490 --> 02:18:40.780
<v Speaker 4>no Chicago,</v>

4526
02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:42.100
<v Speaker 4>no Atlanta.</v>

4527
02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:44.290
<v Speaker 4>Just stop and think of that alone.</v>

4528
02:18:44.291 --> 02:18:49.291
<v Speaker 4>Just what radical changes to the landscape we've seen over the past few hundred</v>

4529
02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:50.201
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

4530
02:18:50.201 --> 02:18:52.270
<v Speaker 4>We get a thousand thousand years ago.</v>

4531
02:18:52.271 --> 02:18:54.490
<v Speaker 4>You wind up in New York on a boat and what are you,</v>

4532
02:18:54.550 --> 02:18:55.383
<v Speaker 4>what are you looking at?</v>

4533
02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:57.400
<v Speaker 4>Looking at some fucking wooden shacks.</v>

4534
02:18:57.770 --> 02:19:00.190
<v Speaker 4>The huddled up together eating beaver pelts.</v>

4535
02:19:00.670 --> 02:19:01.061
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>

4536
02:19:01.061 --> 02:19:01.894
<v Speaker 4>Looking at</v>

4537
02:19:03.550 --> 02:19:05.860
<v Speaker 4>this thing has changed so fast.</v>

4538
02:19:06.010 --> 02:19:06.200
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4539
02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:09.410
<v Speaker 4>I met a guy at a wedding a few years ago who was like,</v>

4540
02:19:09.430 --> 02:19:12.460
<v Speaker 4>one of the world's leading experts on seashells.</v>

4541
02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:14.620
<v Speaker 4>Sounds Kinda boring,</v>

4542
02:19:14.621 --> 02:19:14.831
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4543
02:19:14.831 --> 02:19:19.810
<v Speaker 4>But we ended up talking about wampum and he told me something I'd never read</v>

4544
02:19:19.811 --> 02:19:20.644
<v Speaker 4>anywhere,</v>

4545
02:19:20.770 --> 02:19:21.041
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

4546
02:19:21.041 --> 02:19:21.311
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4547
02:19:21.311 --> 02:19:23.200
<v Speaker 4>wampum writers made from seashells.</v>

4548
02:19:23.230 --> 02:19:24.063
<v Speaker 4>This was like the,</v>

4549
02:19:24.610 --> 02:19:25.391
<v Speaker 4>the name,</v>

4550
02:19:25.391 --> 02:19:28.250
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know what it was that native Americans</v>

4551
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:29.600
<v Speaker 6>used in the northeast.</v>

4552
02:19:29.780 --> 02:19:30.680
<v Speaker 6>Right when,</v>

4553
02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:35.510
<v Speaker 6>when the Dutch first arrived in the very early days of New York is what reminded</v>

4554
02:19:35.511 --> 02:19:36.344
<v Speaker 6>me of it.</v>

4555
02:19:36.750 --> 02:19:41.120
<v Speaker 6>It was made from a particular type of seashell that only grew in a certain area.</v>

4556
02:19:41.660 --> 02:19:43.460
<v Speaker 6>So like all currencies,</v>

4557
02:19:43.461 --> 02:19:45.650
<v Speaker 6>it had a very restricted source,</v>

4558
02:19:45.651 --> 02:19:46.011
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4559
02:19:46.011 --> 02:19:47.200
<v Speaker 6>like gold or whatever,</v>

4560
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:48.660
<v Speaker 6>beaver pelts or whatever it was.</v>

4561
02:19:48.670 --> 02:19:49.340
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

4562
02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:49.641
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>

4563
02:19:49.641 --> 02:19:49.821
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4564
02:19:49.821 --> 02:19:51.170
<v Speaker 6>that's why 20 bucks,</v>

4565
02:19:51.890 --> 02:19:52.850
<v Speaker 6>that's deer skins.</v>

4566
02:19:53.390 --> 02:19:56.240
<v Speaker 6>That deer screens are used as currency and the colonial period.</v>

4567
02:19:56.241 --> 02:19:56.511
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4568
02:19:56.511 --> 02:19:57.920
<v Speaker 6>that's why we say 20 bucks.</v>

4569
02:19:58.580 --> 02:19:58.791
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4570
02:19:58.791 --> 02:19:59.241
<v Speaker 6>But anyway,</v>

4571
02:19:59.241 --> 02:20:00.870
<v Speaker 6>so the Wampum,</v>

4572
02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:04.760
<v Speaker 6>they'd make these belts of wampum that you could use to buy and sell things.</v>

4573
02:20:04.761 --> 02:20:05.300
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4574
02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:10.300
<v Speaker 6>So the Dutch clever bastards that they are figured out how they were making this</v>

4575
02:20:10.761 --> 02:20:13.340
<v Speaker 6>wampum and what sort of seashells it was and they,</v>

4576
02:20:13.430 --> 02:20:17.060
<v Speaker 6>they learn to cultivate that particular molecule.</v>

4577
02:20:17.950 --> 02:20:19.610
<v Speaker 6>They were basically printing,</v>

4578
02:20:19.611 --> 02:20:19.890
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4579
02:20:19.890 --> 02:20:21.140
<v Speaker 6>counterfeit wampum.</v>

4580
02:20:21.650 --> 02:20:22.411
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

4581
02:20:22.411 --> 02:20:25.520
<v Speaker 6>So they didn't even just rip off the Indians when they bought Manhattan.</v>

4582
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:27.530
<v Speaker 6>They bought it with fake money.</v>

4583
02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:28.730
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

4584
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:29.810
<v Speaker 6>Fake Indian money.</v>

4585
02:20:29.870 --> 02:20:30.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4586
02:20:30.070 --> 02:20:30.950
<v Speaker 6>that's hilarious.</v>

4587
02:20:30.951 --> 02:20:32.540
<v Speaker 6>They bought it with seashells.</v>

4588
02:20:32.780 --> 02:20:37.670
<v Speaker 6>And imagine how much your condo goes for now and just think that the whole thing</v>

4589
02:20:37.970 --> 02:20:39.320
<v Speaker 6>went for seashells.</v>

4590
02:20:40.130 --> 02:20:42.620
<v Speaker 6>That's a change in the real estate market right there.</v>

4591
02:20:42.990 --> 02:20:43.521
<v Speaker 6>You know what I love?</v>

4592
02:20:43.521 --> 02:20:46.100
<v Speaker 6>I lived in Manhattan for a few years and last year I was there.</v>

4593
02:20:46.101 --> 02:20:50.660
<v Speaker 6>I worked in a construction site and since we're just talking randomly</v>

4594
02:20:50.661 --> 02:20:51.560
<v Speaker 6>interesting things here,</v>

4595
02:20:52.070 --> 02:20:52.641
<v Speaker 6>the guy,</v>

4596
02:20:52.641 --> 02:20:57.641
<v Speaker 6>one of the laborers on the construction site explain to me why the buildings are</v>

4597
02:20:58.101 --> 02:21:01.760
<v Speaker 6>really high in midtown and then they go down and then they go back up and</v>

4598
02:21:01.761 --> 02:21:04.520
<v Speaker 6>they're high again down in Wall Street and the financial district.</v>

4599
02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:06.720
<v Speaker 6>If you look at Manhattan from New Jersey,</v>

4600
02:21:06.721 --> 02:21:09.000
<v Speaker 6>you're from queens or Brooklyn or whatever the.</v>

4601
02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:12.560
<v Speaker 6>I always thought that was just like what you're saying is like there are all</v>

4602
02:21:12.561 --> 02:21:15.590
<v Speaker 6>these strange things that come together,</v>

4603
02:21:15.591 --> 02:21:17.390
<v Speaker 6>whether it's finance or you know,</v>

4604
02:21:17.391 --> 02:21:18.131
<v Speaker 6>whatever happens,</v>

4605
02:21:18.131 --> 02:21:18.471
<v Speaker 6>stand.</v>

4606
02:21:18.471 --> 02:21:19.710
<v Speaker 6>Somebody wanted to it here.</v>

4607
02:21:19.730 --> 02:21:20.960
<v Speaker 6>There it turns out,</v>

4608
02:21:20.961 --> 02:21:21.191
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4609
02:21:21.191 --> 02:21:24.140
<v Speaker 6>there's a logic to this and the logic is that the,</v>

4610
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:25.310
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

4611
02:21:25.310 --> 02:21:26.510
<v Speaker 6>the rock that grant,</v>

4612
02:21:26.600 --> 02:21:27.040
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

4613
02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:32.040
<v Speaker 6>the geological rock comes up near the surface at midtown and then it goes way</v>

4614
02:21:32.181 --> 02:21:35.530
<v Speaker 6>down again and that Anders Soho in the village and all that,</v>

4615
02:21:35.531 --> 02:21:38.600
<v Speaker 6>and then it comes back up close to the surface at Wall Street.</v>

4616
02:21:38.930 --> 02:21:40.880
<v Speaker 6>So to build a really tall building,</v>

4617
02:21:40.881 --> 02:21:41.750
<v Speaker 6>you have to drill,</v>

4618
02:21:41.751 --> 02:21:42.950
<v Speaker 6>anchor it into the rock.</v>

4619
02:21:43.310 --> 02:21:47.600
<v Speaker 6>So you can't do that where there's a lot of dirt you'd have to like dig down so</v>

4620
02:21:47.601 --> 02:21:50.120
<v Speaker 6>far to get to excavate the whole.</v>

4621
02:21:50.810 --> 02:21:55.340
<v Speaker 6>So you can only build a 50 story building where the bedrock is close to the</v>

4622
02:21:55.341 --> 02:21:57.830
<v Speaker 6>surface and you can anchor it into there.</v>

4623
02:21:57.920 --> 02:21:58.191
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4624
02:21:58.191 --> 02:21:59.570
<v Speaker 6>So it's stable.</v>

4625
02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:00.361
<v Speaker 6>Totally makes sense.</v>

4626
02:22:00.361 --> 02:22:05.361
<v Speaker 6>So what you're seeing when you look at that skyline is like an echo of the</v>

4627
02:22:05.601 --> 02:22:06.980
<v Speaker 6>geology of the island.</v>

4628
02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:08.370
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

4629
02:22:08.370 --> 02:22:08.780
<v Speaker 6>Interesting.</v>

4630
02:22:08.780 --> 02:22:09.590
<v Speaker 6>That is a,</v>

4631
02:22:09.590 --> 02:22:10.940
<v Speaker 6>that is absolutely fascinating.</v>

4632
02:22:11.300 --> 02:22:12.133
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4633
02:22:12.170 --> 02:22:16.130
<v Speaker 6>brings me up to this quote I was going to bring up earlier when you talked about</v>

4634
02:22:16.131 --> 02:22:16.970
<v Speaker 6>Marshall Mcluhan.</v>

4635
02:22:17.390 --> 02:22:19.220
<v Speaker 6>A lot of folks don't know Marshall Mcluhan was,</v>

4636
02:22:19.221 --> 02:22:22.160
<v Speaker 6>but he said a lot of amazing things and one of the things he said,</v>

4637
02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:24.710
<v Speaker 6>I think it was either the fifties,</v>

4638
02:22:25.170 --> 02:22:26.250
<v Speaker 6>I think he said in the fifties,</v>

4639
02:22:26.490 --> 02:22:29.880
<v Speaker 4>he said that man becomes the sex organs of the machine world.</v>

4640
02:22:30.420 --> 02:22:31.253
<v Speaker 4>That's beautiful.</v>

4641
02:22:31.880 --> 02:22:33.630
<v Speaker 4>The craziest statement ever.</v>

4642
02:22:33.860 --> 02:22:36.440
<v Speaker 4>Have you stop and think about how premature it was and our,</v>

4643
02:22:36.460 --> 02:22:36.740
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

4644
02:22:36.740 --> 02:22:36.961
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

4645
02:22:36.961 --> 02:22:41.961
<v Speaker 4>how precocious it was to say that in whatever he said that in 1950 or 1960 and</v>

4646
02:22:43.290 --> 02:22:47.940
<v Speaker 4>look at what's going on now with our symbiotic connection to technology.</v>

4647
02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:50.130
<v Speaker 4>The true machine that's taking over,</v>

4648
02:22:50.310 --> 02:22:50.671
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

4649
02:22:50.671 --> 02:22:52.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm writing that down because I'm going to use that thing.</v>

4650
02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:56.310
<v Speaker 4>I thought about that so many times without even having read his quote,</v>

4651
02:22:56.311 --> 02:23:00.750
<v Speaker 4>but I wasn't able to put it so eloquently in my head because that if that the</v>

4652
02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:02.640
<v Speaker 4>faith look like a life form.</v>

4653
02:23:02.670 --> 02:23:05.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean I have skeletons in my garage.</v>

4654
02:23:05.370 --> 02:23:06.270
<v Speaker 4>It's an old Mac,</v>

4655
02:23:06.271 --> 02:23:11.271
<v Speaker 4>old shitty fucking like Tan thing with the stupid rainbow apple on it.</v>

4656
02:23:11.991 --> 02:23:12.990
<v Speaker 4>I have one of those things.</v>

4657
02:23:12.991 --> 02:23:14.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like really old.</v>

4658
02:23:14.570 --> 02:23:15.331
<v Speaker 4>It's hilarious.</v>

4659
02:23:15.331 --> 02:23:15.871
<v Speaker 4>I look at it,</v>

4660
02:23:15.871 --> 02:23:16.051
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4661
02:23:16.051 --> 02:23:17.050
<v Speaker 4>this is like a dinosaur,</v>

4662
02:23:17.070 --> 02:23:19.170
<v Speaker 4>so might as well be like a dead dinosaur,</v>

4663
02:23:19.180 --> 02:23:21.890
<v Speaker 4>dead useless thing and now you know,</v>

4664
02:23:22.020 --> 02:23:23.490
<v Speaker 4>we don't have dinosaurs anymore.</v>

4665
02:23:23.491 --> 02:23:24.630
<v Speaker 4>Now we got chickens,</v>

4666
02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:24.991
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4667
02:23:24.991 --> 02:23:25.850
<v Speaker 4>now whatever.</v>

4668
02:23:26.060 --> 02:23:26.893
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4669
02:23:27.010 --> 02:23:28.260
<v Speaker 4>it really does seem like.</v>

4670
02:23:28.600 --> 02:23:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4671
02:23:29.170 --> 02:23:33.440
<v Speaker 2>I wrote an article about the future of sex for this European.</v>

4672
02:23:33.450 --> 02:23:34.930
<v Speaker 2>They called the European magazine.</v>

4673
02:23:34.931 --> 02:23:35.060
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4674
02:23:35.060 --> 02:23:36.550
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's a German magazine,</v>

4675
02:23:36.551 --> 02:23:38.110
<v Speaker 2>but they publish in English as well.</v>

4676
02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:41.920
<v Speaker 2>He asked me to write this thing a few months ago and I could have used that</v>

4677
02:23:41.921 --> 02:23:43.840
<v Speaker 2>McLuhan quote that was really good.</v>

4678
02:23:44.050 --> 02:23:49.050
<v Speaker 2>But I said like basically the way I see the future of sex is peeling off in two</v>

4679
02:23:49.301 --> 02:23:53.620
<v Speaker 2>different possible directions depending upon whether there's world collapse or</v>

4680
02:23:53.621 --> 02:23:54.454
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

4681
02:23:54.790 --> 02:23:55.660
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

4682
02:23:55.960 --> 02:23:57.490
<v Speaker 2>if there's not,</v>

4683
02:23:57.670 --> 02:24:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I see us as many people do merging with machines,</v>

4684
02:24:01.961 --> 02:24:02.471
<v Speaker 2>what do they call it?</v>

4685
02:24:02.471 --> 02:24:03.430
<v Speaker 2>The singularity,</v>

4686
02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:06.170
<v Speaker 2>but also in terms of sexuality that you know,</v>

4687
02:24:06.520 --> 02:24:08.020
<v Speaker 2>now we've got flashlights,</v>

4688
02:24:08.050 --> 02:24:11.530
<v Speaker 2>but in a few years we're going to have holographic images.</v>

4689
02:24:11.531 --> 02:24:16.531
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have like the technology is always driven by this sexual hunger.</v>

4690
02:24:17.230 --> 02:24:21.610
<v Speaker 2>There's a book called the erotic engine where this guy argues that every</v>

4691
02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:27.000
<v Speaker 2>communication advance was driven by money coming from orotic energy,</v>

4692
02:24:27.371 --> 02:24:28.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4693
02:24:28.090 --> 02:24:31.960
<v Speaker 2>vhs tapes and then dvds and the Internet,</v>

4694
02:24:31.961 --> 02:24:34.630
<v Speaker 2>like all the first monies coming in for porn,</v>

4695
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4696
02:24:35.490 --> 02:24:36.580
<v Speaker 2>even photography</v>

4697
02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:37.121
<v Speaker 4>first,</v>

4698
02:24:37.121 --> 02:24:38.030
<v Speaker 4>a adapters,</v>

4699
02:24:38.031 --> 02:24:40.460
<v Speaker 4>first time adapters like html five and all that.</v>

4700
02:24:40.461 --> 02:24:45.461
<v Speaker 4>As soon as soon as people realized that the iphone wasn't going to go with flash</v>

4701
02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:50.800
<v Speaker 4>and that a html five seemed like the future when it comes to a animated things</v>

4702
02:24:51.411 --> 02:24:52.244
<v Speaker 4>online,</v>

4703
02:24:52.610 --> 02:24:53.930
<v Speaker 4>porn went right to it.</v>

4704
02:24:53.931 --> 02:24:54.350
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

4705
02:24:54.350 --> 02:24:54.741
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4706
02:24:54.741 --> 02:24:56.150
<v Speaker 4>whereas a lot of websites,</v>

4707
02:24:56.151 --> 02:24:56.601
<v Speaker 4>you still,</v>

4708
02:24:56.601 --> 02:24:59.510
<v Speaker 4>you go to it on an iphone and it'll show you the adobe thing.</v>

4709
02:24:59.511 --> 02:25:01.940
<v Speaker 4>Not supported and not porn.</v>

4710
02:25:01.970 --> 02:25:04.100
<v Speaker 4>They figured out right away I had him on the ball.</v>

4711
02:25:04.101 --> 02:25:04.251
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4712
02:25:04.251 --> 02:25:06.500
<v Speaker 4>They gotta make it so you could watch people fuck on your phone.</v>

4713
02:25:06.650 --> 02:25:07.483
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4714
02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:10.310
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it amazing though that that is a sort of,</v>

4715
02:25:10.370 --> 02:25:11.203
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

4716
02:25:11.210 --> 02:25:12.170
<v Speaker 4>in the closet,</v>

4717
02:25:12.440 --> 02:25:15.980
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of a background sort of reality,</v>

4718
02:25:16.220 --> 02:25:19.330
<v Speaker 4>like all the banks in Miami being funded by cocaine.</v>

4719
02:25:19.550 --> 02:25:20.480
<v Speaker 4>Everybody knows it,</v>

4720
02:25:20.481 --> 02:25:21.590
<v Speaker 4>but nobody talks about it.</v>

4721
02:25:21.610 --> 02:25:21.731
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4722
02:25:21.731 --> 02:25:22.090
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4723
02:25:22.090 --> 02:25:23.090
<v Speaker 4>why is there so many banks,</v>

4724
02:25:23.170 --> 02:25:23.531
<v Speaker 4>Miami?</v>

4725
02:25:23.531 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 4>Because that's where the</v>

4726
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:25.090
<v Speaker 1>fucking cocaine came from.</v>

4727
02:25:25.420 --> 02:25:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

4728
02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Why is,</v>

4729
02:25:27.220 --> 02:25:29.680
<v Speaker 1>why is technology moving towards html five?</v>

4730
02:25:29.681 --> 02:25:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Why is what,</v>

4731
02:25:30.490 --> 02:25:32.650
<v Speaker 1>what is online streaming technology?</v>

4732
02:25:32.651 --> 02:25:33.401
<v Speaker 1>Where's its roots?</v>

4733
02:25:33.401 --> 02:25:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Its roots are in people watching people.</v>

4734
02:25:34.991 --> 02:25:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

4735
02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:36.880
<v Speaker 1>That's where they got it down.</v>

4736
02:25:36.881 --> 02:25:40.300
<v Speaker 1>That's where they get really good at it and that's where the money is.</v>

4737
02:25:40.700 --> 02:25:41.680
<v Speaker 1>And then that might.</v>

4738
02:25:41.681 --> 02:25:41.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4739
02:25:41.921 --> 02:25:45.160
<v Speaker 1>what percentage of that was responsible for the development of the CD Rom?</v>

4740
02:25:45.161 --> 02:25:45.994
<v Speaker 1>What percentage of the.</v>

4741
02:25:46.270 --> 02:25:46.541
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4742
02:25:46.541 --> 02:25:51.430
<v Speaker 1>how much I would like to know about the erotic engine that he talks about all</v>

4743
02:25:51.431 --> 02:25:51.800
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

4744
02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4745
02:25:52.420 --> 02:25:54.610
<v Speaker 1>because before the Internet came along,</v>

4746
02:25:54.670 --> 02:25:57.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many people bought movies as supposed to?</v>

4747
02:25:57.461 --> 02:25:59.050
<v Speaker 1>How many people bought dirty movies?</v>

4748
02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:01.150
<v Speaker 1>What was the share of the market?</v>

4749
02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:02.771
<v Speaker 1>Fucking chunk,</v>

4750
02:26:02.771 --> 02:26:03.550
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4751
02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:03.821
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4752
02:26:03.821 --> 02:26:04.654
<v Speaker 1>Miss Cinemas,</v>

4753
02:26:05.420 --> 02:26:06.253
<v Speaker 1>the porn.</v>

4754
02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:09.610
<v Speaker 1>That was another thing from your book that I found completely fascinating.</v>

4755
02:26:09.650 --> 02:26:14.650
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think about was how we have this idea of corporate America not being</v>

4756
02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:18.280
<v Speaker 1>not profit profiting in porn,</v>

4757
02:26:18.610 --> 02:26:23.610
<v Speaker 1>but how in fact like chains of hotels are like the biggest porn providers in the</v>

4758
02:26:26.621 --> 02:26:27.160
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

4759
02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4760
02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:28.071
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

4761
02:26:28.071 --> 02:26:32.060
<v Speaker 6>They're making huge proportion of their profits from those on demand movies.</v>

4762
02:26:32.300 --> 02:26:33.860
<v Speaker 1>Last week when I was in San Diego,</v>

4763
02:26:33.861 --> 02:26:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I literally went through the whole entire list of porn because they were so</v>

4764
02:26:38.090 --> 02:26:38.331
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

4765
02:26:38.331 --> 02:26:38.721
<v Speaker 1>Titles.</v>

4766
02:26:38.721 --> 02:26:41.600
<v Speaker 1>It was probably 300 titles that they just had their</v>

4767
02:26:43.100 --> 02:26:44.120
<v Speaker 1>and they're selling for like what,</v>

4768
02:26:44.121 --> 02:26:46.820
<v Speaker 1>20 bucks or $10,</v>

4769
02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:47.691
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

4770
02:26:47.691 --> 02:26:49.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's pure profit at a certain point,</v>

4771
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4772
02:26:49.881 --> 02:26:52.820
<v Speaker 1>and once they pay the licensing fee off or whatever it is,</v>

4773
02:26:53.210 --> 02:26:54.210
<v Speaker 1>so them.</v>

4774
02:26:54.260 --> 02:26:59.060
<v Speaker 1>And you know what it was the other example you had of people that were profiting</v>

4775
02:26:59.061 --> 02:27:00.590
<v Speaker 1>off point that you would not expect.</v>

4776
02:27:02.300 --> 02:27:02.840
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4777
02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:03.441
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember.</v>

4778
02:27:03.441 --> 02:27:04.101
<v Speaker 6>I remember the,</v>

4779
02:27:04.101 --> 02:27:08.060
<v Speaker 6>the corporate thing you're talking about and I think the corporation in question</v>

4780
02:27:08.061 --> 02:27:11.660
<v Speaker 6>might've been coca cola or somebody owned by Mormons or something.</v>

4781
02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:15.980
<v Speaker 6>It was some like really conservative public image,</v>

4782
02:27:16.010 --> 02:27:19.070
<v Speaker 6>but they were the biggest supplier to the hotel chains.</v>

4783
02:27:20.300 --> 02:27:20.751
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4784
02:27:20.751 --> 02:27:23.360
<v Speaker 6>And they were definitely going to be hilarious.</v>

4785
02:27:25.870 --> 02:27:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Chick fil a is only into chickens and Dixon Asad said the other day I</v>

4786
02:27:30.491 --> 02:27:32.740
<v Speaker 1>interviewed Nina Hartley from podcast.</v>

4787
02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:34.630
<v Speaker 1>She's really interested in how to run away from her.</v>

4788
02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:38.440
<v Speaker 1>She was on Kevin Prayers podcast and as soon as she's talking about how she only</v>

4789
02:27:38.441 --> 02:27:39.510
<v Speaker 1>has sex with gloves on,</v>

4790
02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4791
02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:40.743
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

4792
02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:42.550
<v Speaker 1>you lost me.</v>

4793
02:27:43.090 --> 02:27:43.923
<v Speaker 1>I lost me bitch.</v>

4794
02:27:43.930 --> 02:27:44.763
<v Speaker 1>I got to go.</v>

4795
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:50.190
<v Speaker 1>She only had sex with Linda fisting and finger souls and plus these and she</v>

4796
02:27:50.411 --> 02:27:51.460
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want fingernails.</v>

4797
02:27:51.461 --> 02:27:52.420
<v Speaker 1>And I mean it makes sense,</v>

4798
02:27:52.660 --> 02:27:54.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's because she's a goddamn professional.</v>

4799
02:27:54.161 --> 02:27:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's got the pro clinic goal.</v>

4800
02:27:55.961 --> 02:27:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Snap a rubber glove approach to sex.</v>

4801
02:27:59.501 --> 02:28:00.550
<v Speaker 1>She's also a nurse.</v>

4802
02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:04.300
<v Speaker 1>She has her own flashlight,</v>

4803
02:28:04.330 --> 02:28:04.571
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4804
02:28:04.571 --> 02:28:07.690
<v Speaker 1>She's got her own and resembles a metal hitting a large mammal.</v>

4805
02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:09.793
<v Speaker 1>What you would get.</v>

4806
02:28:12.010 --> 02:28:12.843
<v Speaker 1>Nice Lady.</v>

4807
02:28:13.150 --> 02:28:13.983
<v Speaker 1>She's not freak.</v>

4808

4812
02:28:17.470 --> 02:28:18.191
<v Speaker 1>That's what she is,</v>

4813
02:28:18.191 --> 02:28:19.024
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4814
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4817
02:28:21.210 --> 02:28:22.043

<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

02:28:55.150 --> 02:28:55.451
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4842
02:28:55.451 --> 02:28:58.240
<v Speaker 6>whatever they're going out to dinner and he gets a text from her a few hours</v>

4843
02:28:58.241 --> 02:28:59.380
<v Speaker 6>before dinner saying,</v>

4844
02:28:59.890 --> 02:29:00.300
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

4845
02:29:00.300 --> 02:29:00.790
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

4846
02:29:00.790 --> 02:29:04.270
<v Speaker 6>I just want to be upfront about this as polyamorous people off in art.</v>

4847
02:29:04.930 --> 02:29:08.170
<v Speaker 6>My agreement with my partner is,</v>

4848
02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:09.393
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4849
02:29:09.700 --> 02:29:10.420
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

4850
02:29:10.420 --> 02:29:11.710
<v Speaker 6>what was the detail or the,</v>

4851
02:29:11.711 --> 02:29:13.930
<v Speaker 6>the agreement is no,</v>

4852
02:29:14.050 --> 02:29:15.310
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4853
02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:16.180
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4854
02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:17.080
<v Speaker 6>intercourse,</v>

4855
02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:20.350
<v Speaker 6>so we can do whatever else but no intercourse.</v>

4856
02:29:20.351 --> 02:29:21.130
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4857
02:29:21.130 --> 02:29:21.881
<v Speaker 6>So He's thinking,</v>

4858
02:29:21.881 --> 02:29:22.031
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4859
02:29:22.031 --> 02:29:22.271
<v Speaker 6>Geez,</v>

4860
02:29:22.271 --> 02:29:23.260
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was just dinner.</v>

4861
02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:23.621
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4862
02:29:23.621 --> 02:29:24.191
<v Speaker 6>So I guess,</v>

4863
02:29:24.191 --> 02:29:24.640
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

4864
02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:25.750
<v Speaker 6>That's pretty good news.</v>

4865
02:29:25.751 --> 02:29:26.030
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4866
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:28.640
<v Speaker 6>it seems like everything else is on the table.</v>

4867
02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:32.410
<v Speaker 6>So then they end up back in her place and she says,</v>

4868
02:29:32.411 --> 02:29:32.531
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4869
02:29:32.531 --> 02:29:32.921
<v Speaker 6>sorry,</v>

4870
02:29:32.921 --> 02:29:33.190
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

4871
02:29:33.190 --> 02:29:33.551
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4872
02:29:33.551 --> 02:29:33.881
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

4873
02:29:33.881 --> 02:29:35.170
<v Speaker 6>the rule changed a little bit.</v>

4874
02:29:35.170 --> 02:29:35.921
<v Speaker 6>Now it's like,</v>

4875
02:29:35.921 --> 02:29:38.800
<v Speaker 6>I know genital contact.</v>

4876
02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:39.940
<v Speaker 6>So they're making out.</v>

4877
02:29:39.941 --> 02:29:40.511
<v Speaker 6>And she says,</v>

4878
02:29:40.511 --> 02:29:40.781
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

4879
02:29:40.781 --> 02:29:41.171
<v Speaker 6>sorry,</v>

4880
02:29:41.171 --> 02:29:41.351
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4881
02:29:41.351 --> 02:29:43.300
<v Speaker 6>my boyfriend says no genital contact,</v>

4882
02:29:43.301 --> 02:29:43.900
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4883
02:29:43.900 --> 02:29:44.471
<v Speaker 6>So he says,</v>

4884
02:29:44.471 --> 02:29:44.711
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

4885
02:29:44.711 --> 02:29:45.544
<v Speaker 6>that's fine.</v>

4886
02:29:45.700 --> 02:29:47.140
<v Speaker 6>So then she says,</v>

4887
02:29:47.141 --> 02:29:47.660
<v Speaker 6>wait a minute,</v>

4888
02:29:47.660 --> 02:29:48.750
<v Speaker 6>they're getting all hot and heavy.</v>

4889
02:29:48.760 --> 02:29:49.121
<v Speaker 6>She says,</v>

4890
02:29:49.121 --> 02:29:49.511
<v Speaker 6>wait a minute,</v>

4891
02:29:49.511 --> 02:29:50.261
<v Speaker 6>she goes to the other room,</v>

4892
02:29:50.261 --> 02:29:55.240
<v Speaker 6>she comes back and she's got these black latex gloves on and she starts giving</v>

4893
02:29:55.241 --> 02:29:57.340
<v Speaker 6>him a hand job because like,</v>

4894
02:29:57.341 --> 02:30:02.341
<v Speaker 6>apparently with the gloves there's no contact and then she gives him a Dildo.</v>

4895
02:30:02.771 --> 02:30:03.521
<v Speaker 6>So there's like,</v>

4896
02:30:03.521 --> 02:30:05.530
<v Speaker 6>all this crazy stuff is going on.</v>

4897
02:30:05.860 --> 02:30:07.180
<v Speaker 6>And he told me this story.</v>

4898
02:30:07.181 --> 02:30:07.750
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

4899
02:30:07.750 --> 02:30:12.400
<v Speaker 6>this was so far beyond what I would have anticipated.</v>

4900
02:30:12.820 --> 02:30:13.421
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

4901
02:30:13.421 --> 02:30:16.510
<v Speaker 6>And it got really freaky because of these rules.</v>

4902
02:30:17.020 --> 02:30:17.351
<v Speaker 6>Of course,</v>

4903
02:30:17.351 --> 02:30:18.820
<v Speaker 6>it made me think about drugs,</v>

4904
02:30:19.120 --> 02:30:19.511
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4905
02:30:19.511 --> 02:30:20.050
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4906
02:30:20.050 --> 02:30:20.500
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

4907
02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:22.390
<v Speaker 6>if coca leaf is illegal,</v>

4908
02:30:22.391 --> 02:30:24.070
<v Speaker 6>well then they're going to make cocaine.</v>

4909
02:30:24.520 --> 02:30:24.971
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4910
02:30:24.971 --> 02:30:25.750
<v Speaker 6>if grasp,</v>

4911
02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:27.590
<v Speaker 6>if you can't just grow grass in your backyard,</v>

4912
02:30:27.591 --> 02:30:29.050
<v Speaker 6>then you're going to get hydroponic,</v>

4913
02:30:29.051 --> 02:30:29.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4914
02:30:29.490 --> 02:30:30.490
<v Speaker 6>super grass.</v>

4915
02:30:30.491 --> 02:30:32.470
<v Speaker 6>It's like you make these rules,</v>

4916
02:30:32.830 --> 02:30:33.161
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4917
02:30:33.161 --> 02:30:34.000
<v Speaker 6>like hard liquor,</v>

4918
02:30:34.390 --> 02:30:35.223
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4919
02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:38.290
<v Speaker 6>Prohibition is what started gin and all this kind of stuff,</v>

4920
02:30:38.291 --> 02:30:38.830
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4921
02:30:38.830 --> 02:30:43.830
<v Speaker 6>So you make rules to try to contain a natural human appetite and what happens is</v>

4922
02:30:45.851 --> 02:30:46.960
<v Speaker 6>it gets explosive,</v>

4923
02:30:47.620 --> 02:30:47.921
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4924
02:30:47.921 --> 02:30:48.760
<v Speaker 6>Just like a bomb.</v>

4925
02:30:48.970 --> 02:30:52.990
<v Speaker 6>The bomb needs the containment to be explosive,</v>

4926
02:30:53.020 --> 02:30:54.730
<v Speaker 6>otherwise it's just nothing.</v>

4927
02:30:55.370 --> 02:30:59.600
<v Speaker 4>It gets a natural human inclination that I could see loud and clearly with my</v>

4928
02:30:59.601 --> 02:31:00.410
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>

4929
02:31:00.410 --> 02:31:02.630
<v Speaker 4>When you try to keep kids from doing things,</v>

4930
02:31:02.631 --> 02:31:03.500
<v Speaker 4>they automatically like,</v>

4931
02:31:03.501 --> 02:31:04.760
<v Speaker 4>why the fuck should I listen to you?</v>

4932
02:31:04.761 --> 02:31:05.120
<v Speaker 4>I want,</v>

4933
02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:05.953
<v Speaker 4>that's what I want to do.</v>

4934
02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:06.681
<v Speaker 4>They get angry.</v>

4935
02:31:06.681 --> 02:31:11.681
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's a natural human response because all of our entire history of</v>

4936
02:31:12.380 --> 02:31:14.930
<v Speaker 4>humanity has been people trying to dominate people,</v>

4937
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:16.100
<v Speaker 4>people trying to control people.</v>

4938
02:31:16.101 --> 02:31:18.860
<v Speaker 4>So our natural thing is to resist.</v>

4939
02:31:19.410 --> 02:31:22.230
<v Speaker 4>It's why the biggest slut always have like super religious parents.</v>

4940
02:31:23.220 --> 02:31:23.970
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

4941
02:31:23.970 --> 02:31:24.721
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

4942
02:31:24.721 --> 02:31:25.021
<v Speaker 4>Folks.</v>

4943
02:31:25.021 --> 02:31:25.890
<v Speaker 4>Is it that easy?</v>

4944
02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:29.550
<v Speaker 4>Does Dr Christopher Ryan have to explain it that easy?</v>

4945
02:31:30.330 --> 02:31:31.000
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4946
02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:31.771
<v Speaker 4>Nina Hartley's.</v>

4947
02:31:31.771 --> 02:31:32.880
<v Speaker 4>Parents interestingly,</v>

4948
02:31:32.881 --> 02:31:35.850
<v Speaker 4>were communists who were blacklisted in Berkeley.</v>

4949
02:31:36.210 --> 02:31:36.541
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

4950
02:31:36.541 --> 02:31:37.260
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

4951
02:31:37.260 --> 02:31:37.501
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4952
02:31:37.501 --> 02:31:38.334
<v Speaker 4>she's an old hippy.</v>

4953
02:31:38.610 --> 02:31:39.060
<v Speaker 4>She's a,</v>

4954
02:31:39.060 --> 02:31:39.510
<v Speaker 4>she's a,</v>

4955
02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:40.530
<v Speaker 4>she's an odd case.</v>

4956
02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:41.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4957
02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:42.120
<v Speaker 4>she like,</v>

4958
02:31:42.120 --> 02:31:43.910
<v Speaker 4>she's one of the rare ones where you,</v>

4959
02:31:43.950 --> 02:31:45.990
<v Speaker 4>you always connect human,</v>

4960
02:31:47.250 --> 02:31:50.070
<v Speaker 4>like girls who were into porn or getting into that,</v>

4961
02:31:50.071 --> 02:31:51.690
<v Speaker 4>you always connected with some sort of an abuse.</v>

4962
02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:52.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4963
02:31:52.100 --> 02:31:52.371
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4964
02:31:52.371 --> 02:31:53.470
<v Speaker 4>some human aberration,</v>

4965
02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:57.630
<v Speaker 4>but now with her she seems like just a crazy old hippie freak doesn't seem</v>

4966
02:31:57.631 --> 02:31:58.080
<v Speaker 4>dirty.</v>

4967
02:31:58.080 --> 02:31:59.020
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>

4968
02:31:59.060 --> 02:31:59.500
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4969
02:31:59.500 --> 02:32:00.170
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4970
02:32:00.170 --> 02:32:00.930
<v Speaker 4>it's weird.</v>

4971
02:32:00.930 --> 02:32:01.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4972
02:32:01.580 --> 02:32:01.831
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4973
02:32:01.831 --> 02:32:02.191
<v Speaker 4>she's,</v>

4974
02:32:02.191 --> 02:32:03.360
<v Speaker 4>she's an interesting person.</v>

4975
02:32:03.361 --> 02:32:03.661
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy.</v>

4976
02:32:03.661 --> 02:32:04.080
<v Speaker 4>What is the,</v>

4977
02:32:04.080 --> 02:32:07.770
<v Speaker 4>what is the weirdest thing you've gotten out of this study of human sexuality</v>

4978
02:32:07.771 --> 02:32:08.320
<v Speaker 4>because it's,</v>

4979
02:32:08.320 --> 02:32:11.550
<v Speaker 4>your book is incredibly enlightening and I think Dunkin's uh,</v>

4980
02:32:11.580 --> 02:32:12.030
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

4981
02:32:12.030 --> 02:32:12.481
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

4982
02:32:12.481 --> 02:32:12.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4983
02:32:12.810 --> 02:32:17.810
<v Speaker 4>definition of you as a shame exercise is really a perfect one because it puts so</v>

4984
02:32:17.881 --> 02:32:19.650
<v Speaker 4>many things into perspective and it makes,</v>

4985
02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:24.000
<v Speaker 4>it makes so many weird patterns of behavior that we follow.</v>

4986
02:32:24.001 --> 02:32:26.820
<v Speaker 4>It's sort of enlightens you on the origins of them,</v>

4987
02:32:26.821 --> 02:32:30.360
<v Speaker 4>but what is like one of the weirdest things that you've found in this pursuit?</v>

4988
02:32:31.010 --> 02:32:31.791
<v Speaker 6>Well yeah,</v>

4989
02:32:31.791 --> 02:32:32.720
<v Speaker 6>there are so many,</v>

4990
02:32:32.721 --> 02:32:32.991
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4991
02:32:32.991 --> 02:32:36.290
<v Speaker 6>obviously these things pop up in every conversation,</v>

4992
02:32:36.291 --> 02:32:37.820
<v Speaker 6>but I think one of the most,</v>

4993
02:32:37.910 --> 02:32:38.690
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4994
02:32:38.690 --> 02:32:39.720
<v Speaker 6>memorable and,</v>

4995
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:44.750
<v Speaker 6>and moving in a way was when I went looking for the first documented case of a</v>

4996
02:32:47.210 --> 02:32:48.620
<v Speaker 6>key parties and,</v>

4997
02:32:48.621 --> 02:32:48.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4998
02:32:48.860 --> 02:32:50.970
<v Speaker 6>partner swapping and that sort of thing in,</v>

4999
02:32:51.020 --> 02:32:52.490
<v Speaker 6>in modern America,</v>

5000
02:32:52.940 --> 02:32:55.430
<v Speaker 6>not these sex in the 19th century,</v>

5001
02:32:55.640 --> 02:32:56.870
<v Speaker 6>20th century stuff.</v>

5002
02:32:57.410 --> 02:32:58.730
<v Speaker 6>I thought it would be,</v>

5003
02:32:59.180 --> 02:32:59.650
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5004
02:32:59.650 --> 02:32:59.930
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5005
02:32:59.930 --> 02:33:03.860
<v Speaker 6>some commune in Berkeley with a bunch of hippies and Hendrix posters and,</v>

5006
02:33:03.861 --> 02:33:04.131
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5007
02:33:04.131 --> 02:33:05.420
<v Speaker 6>whatever waterbeds and,</v>

5008
02:33:05.421 --> 02:33:05.570
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5009
02:33:05.570 --> 02:33:06.403
<v Speaker 6>that Kinda thing.</v>

5010
02:33:06.740 --> 02:33:07.573
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

5011
02:33:07.580 --> 02:33:08.271
<v Speaker 6>but it wasn't,</v>

5012
02:33:08.271 --> 02:33:13.271
<v Speaker 6>it was World War Two fighter pilots in the Pacific who had the highest fatality</v>

5013
02:33:15.381 --> 02:33:18.170
<v Speaker 6>rate of any branch of the military in World War II.</v>

5014
02:33:18.200 --> 02:33:22.820
<v Speaker 6>Twenty five percent of them died in action when they were back on base,</v>

5015
02:33:23.120 --> 02:33:25.640
<v Speaker 6>I guess in Hawaii or the west coast.</v>

5016
02:33:26.240 --> 02:33:31.240
<v Speaker 6>They had key parties where they and their partners would come to these parties,</v>

5017
02:33:32.330 --> 02:33:33.200
<v Speaker 6>put the keys in,</v>

5018
02:33:33.201 --> 02:33:33.421
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5019
02:33:33.421 --> 02:33:34.460
<v Speaker 6>like in the ice storm.</v>

5020
02:33:34.460 --> 02:33:35.390
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if you saw that movie,</v>

5021
02:33:35.570 --> 02:33:36.400
<v Speaker 6>great movie,</v>

5022
02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:37.233
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5023
02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:41.030
<v Speaker 6>and randomly sleep with each other's wives or girlfriends.</v>

5024
02:33:41.031 --> 02:33:41.864
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

5025
02:33:41.900 --> 02:33:42.830
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

5026
02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:44.713
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5027
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:46.220
<v Speaker 6>these are all like super,</v>

5028
02:33:46.300 --> 02:33:47.060
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5029
02:33:47.060 --> 02:33:47.781
<v Speaker 6>genetically.</v>

5030
02:33:47.781 --> 02:33:48.050
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5031
02:33:48.050 --> 02:33:48.890
<v Speaker 6>good looking dudes.</v>

5032
02:33:48.891 --> 02:33:51.950
<v Speaker 6>All Alpha males obviously and the women they were with were hot.</v>

5033
02:33:51.951 --> 02:33:53.720
<v Speaker 6>So I don't think anyone was worried about,</v>

5034
02:33:53.750 --> 02:33:54.290
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5035
02:33:54.290 --> 02:33:56.030
<v Speaker 6>pulling the short straw to the,</v>

5036
02:33:56.470 --> 02:33:57.320
<v Speaker 6>the short key.</v>

5037
02:33:57.680 --> 02:33:58.040
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5038
02:33:58.040 --> 02:33:58.873
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

5039
02:33:58.910 --> 02:33:59.450
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5040
02:33:59.450 --> 02:33:59.630
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

5041
02:33:59.630 --> 02:34:00.620
<v Speaker 6>I thought,</v>

5042
02:34:00.621 --> 02:34:00.831
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

5043
02:34:00.831 --> 02:34:01.401
<v Speaker 6>okay sure,</v>

5044
02:34:01.401 --> 02:34:02.600
<v Speaker 6>these guys are facing death.</v>

5045
02:34:02.630 --> 02:34:03.920
<v Speaker 6>They want to get it while they can.</v>

5046
02:34:03.921 --> 02:34:04.400
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5047
02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:06.770
<v Speaker 6>But then in the interviews I read with the survivors,</v>

5048
02:34:06.771 --> 02:34:07.700
<v Speaker 6>what they said was,</v>

5049
02:34:07.970 --> 02:34:08.331
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5050
02:34:08.331 --> 02:34:08.661
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

5051
02:34:08.661 --> 02:34:09.441
<v Speaker 6>we were young,</v>

5052
02:34:09.441 --> 02:34:10.101
<v Speaker 6>we were strong,</v>

5053
02:34:10.101 --> 02:34:10.371
<v Speaker 6>we were,</v>

5054
02:34:10.371 --> 02:34:10.511
<v Speaker 6>have,</v>

5055
02:34:10.511 --> 02:34:10.920
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5056
02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:14.240
<v Speaker 6>we were getting laid but we could have gotten laid anywhere.</v>

5057
02:34:14.270 --> 02:34:14.721
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5058
02:34:14.721 --> 02:34:16.460
<v Speaker 6>we could have gone to a bar and gotten lay.</v>

5059
02:34:16.461 --> 02:34:18.670
<v Speaker 6>We did because</v>

5060
02:34:19.390 --> 02:34:21.700
<v Speaker 2>we wanted those other guys.</v>

5061
02:34:21.701 --> 02:34:26.350
<v Speaker 2>We wanted our buddies to love our women so that if I die,</v>

5062
02:34:26.470 --> 02:34:30.490
<v Speaker 2>I know these guys will take care of her because they love her because they've</v>

5063
02:34:30.491 --> 02:34:31.240
<v Speaker 2>been with her.</v>

5064
02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:32.200
<v Speaker 2>They know her.</v>

5065
02:34:32.201 --> 02:34:33.034
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5066
02:34:33.380 --> 02:34:34.161
<v Speaker 2>It's like it,</v>

5067
02:34:34.161 --> 02:34:39.161
<v Speaker 2>it moved me so much to read that because a lot of the accounts from the Amazon</v>

5068
02:34:40.540 --> 02:34:41.373
<v Speaker 2>are the same.</v>

5069
02:34:41.410 --> 02:34:43.690
<v Speaker 2>These guys are facing a difficult life.</v>

5070
02:34:43.980 --> 02:34:47.170
<v Speaker 2>You can go hunting one day and you get your,</v>

5071
02:34:47.171 --> 02:34:47.840
<v Speaker 2>the Hunty,</v>

5072
02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:48.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5073
02:34:48.430 --> 02:34:50.140
<v Speaker 2>things can go wrong really fast,</v>

5074
02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:54.010
<v Speaker 2>so you want people to love each other,</v>

5075
02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:57.430
<v Speaker 2>not exclusively because then they take care of each other,</v>

5076
02:34:57.431 --> 02:34:58.840
<v Speaker 2>they take care of each other's kids,</v>

5077
02:34:58.841 --> 02:35:00.670
<v Speaker 2>they share their food,</v>

5078
02:35:00.671 --> 02:35:00.851
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

5079
02:35:00.851 --> 02:35:01.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5080
02:35:01.211 --> 02:35:02.560
<v Speaker 2>they look out for each other.</v>

5081
02:35:02.830 --> 02:35:05.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's really the essence of humanity.</v>

5082
02:35:05.460 --> 02:35:10.460
<v Speaker 4>Have you explored the idea that the opposite trend that we are finding ourselves</v>

5083
02:35:10.921 --> 02:35:15.921
<v Speaker 4>in now where people are just gravitating towards monogamy at least culturally,</v>

5084
02:35:16.330 --> 02:35:17.310
<v Speaker 4>at least on paper,</v>

5085
02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:18.391
<v Speaker 4>that this,</v>

5086
02:35:18.391 --> 02:35:18.601
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5087
02:35:18.601 --> 02:35:23.601
<v Speaker 4>this move towards that ideal is because we're safer is because we're more likely</v>

5088
02:35:24.121 --> 02:35:24.901
<v Speaker 4>to be protected.</v>

5089
02:35:24.901 --> 02:35:25.770
<v Speaker 4>We don't need these.</v>

5090
02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:30.360
<v Speaker 4>We in sort of a natural inclination to move towards a deeper bond with one</v>

5091
02:35:30.361 --> 02:35:31.320
<v Speaker 4>individual person.</v>

5092
02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:33.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that I'd call it a natural inclination,</v>

5093
02:35:33.751 --> 02:35:34.501
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

5094
02:35:34.501 --> 02:35:34.701
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

5095
02:35:34.701 --> 02:35:39.300
<v Speaker 4>I tend to see it more as a byproduct of institutional and economic forces.</v>

5096
02:35:39.450 --> 02:35:41.400
<v Speaker 4>I see that as also being natural.</v>

5097
02:35:41.401 --> 02:35:46.080
<v Speaker 4>And I know it sounds very contradictory when I look at Wolf behavior.</v>

5098
02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:46.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5099
02:35:46.460 --> 02:35:46.750
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

5100
02:35:46.750 --> 02:35:51.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't take our crazy fucked up weird behavior and not think that it's natural.</v>

5101
02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:55.500
<v Speaker 4>Even though there's consciousness involve and choices involved,</v>

5102
02:35:55.501 --> 02:35:58.020
<v Speaker 4>there's something about the pattern of human behavior.</v>

5103
02:35:58.021 --> 02:35:59.070
<v Speaker 4>When I look at it as a whole,</v>

5104
02:35:59.071 --> 02:36:02.370
<v Speaker 4>where I see it's kind of arrogant to assume that this isn't natural.</v>

5105
02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:04.500
<v Speaker 4>It seems that almost everything is natural.</v>

5106
02:36:04.501 --> 02:36:05.131
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

5107
02:36:05.131 --> 02:36:06.240
<v Speaker 4>It depends how you define.</v>

5108
02:36:07.350 --> 02:36:08.011
<v Speaker 4>I mean you could,</v>

5109
02:36:08.011 --> 02:36:08.960
<v Speaker 4>if you take a real</v>

5110
02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:10.610
<v Speaker 2>global perspective,</v>

5111
02:36:10.611 --> 02:36:15.611
<v Speaker 2>you could say as I tend to think of it that we are not where the ants and the</v>

5112
02:36:16.041 --> 02:36:21.041
<v Speaker 2>ant hill and the ant hill is what's evolving and that's the sort of the,</v>

5113
02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:22.430
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5114
02:36:22.430 --> 02:36:24.800
<v Speaker 2>the location of the selection.</v>

5115
02:36:25.130 --> 02:36:25.940
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

5116
02:36:25.940 --> 02:36:27.290
<v Speaker 2>as individuals,</v>

5117
02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:30.170
<v Speaker 2>we think we're what's evolving,</v>

5118
02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:33.890
<v Speaker 2>but I think what's evolving is society's corporations,</v>

5119
02:36:33.891 --> 02:36:35.110
<v Speaker 2>these institutions that,</v>

5120
02:36:35.370 --> 02:36:39.380
<v Speaker 2>that include us and they don't give a shit if we're happy or not.</v>

5121
02:36:39.690 --> 02:36:40.250
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

5122
02:36:40.250 --> 02:36:41.980
<v Speaker 2>this larger being that we're in or a</v>

5123
02:36:41.990 --> 02:36:44.270
<v Speaker 4>part of as we fuel them with electricity,</v>

5124
02:36:44.271 --> 02:36:44.841
<v Speaker 4>with commerce,</v>

5125
02:36:44.841 --> 02:36:45.351
<v Speaker 4>with whatever.</v>

5126
02:36:45.351 --> 02:36:47.330
<v Speaker 4>They literally act like a life form.</v>

5127
02:36:47.331 --> 02:36:49.370
<v Speaker 4>This is the same way as technology.</v>

5128
02:36:49.371 --> 02:36:50.420
<v Speaker 4>Like Marshall Mcluhan said,</v>

5129
02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:51.920
<v Speaker 4>we are the sexual organs.</v>

5130
02:36:51.930 --> 02:36:53.030
<v Speaker 4>Those machines,</v>

5131
02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:53.690
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

5132
02:36:53.690 --> 02:36:55.150
<v Speaker 4>as we fuel the,</v>

5133
02:36:55.151 --> 02:36:55.310
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5134
02:36:55.310 --> 02:36:57.170
<v Speaker 4>the desire for new laptops,</v>

5135
02:36:57.171 --> 02:36:58.190
<v Speaker 4>we keep that alive.</v>

5136
02:36:58.460 --> 02:36:58.870
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5137
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:59.140
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

5138
02:36:59.140 --> 02:36:59.751
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

5139
02:36:59.751 --> 02:37:00.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5140
02:37:00.060 --> 02:37:02.930
<v Speaker 4>when Mitt Romney said corporations are people in my friend,</v>

5141
02:37:02.931 --> 02:37:04.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he was thinking in these terms,</v>

5142
02:37:05.300 --> 02:37:06.320
<v Speaker 4>but they're not people,</v>

5143
02:37:06.321 --> 02:37:07.460
<v Speaker 4>but they're living beings,</v>

5144
02:37:07.540 --> 02:37:09.110
<v Speaker 4>they have a stake and staying alive.</v>

5145
02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:12.650
<v Speaker 4>They have a vested interest and if step on us to do it,</v>

5146
02:37:12.651 --> 02:37:13.170
<v Speaker 4>they'll do it,</v>

5147
02:37:13.170 --> 02:37:13.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5148
02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:14.510
<v Speaker 4>fucking crazy is that.</v>

5149
02:37:14.511 --> 02:37:16.070
<v Speaker 4>And they can get to do it for them.</v>

5150
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:16.963
<v Speaker 6>Frankenstein,</v>

5151
02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:17.341
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5152
02:37:17.341 --> 02:37:20.230
<v Speaker 6>that was the whole Frankenstein myth and it's happier,</v>

5153
02:37:20.540 --> 02:37:20.961
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5154
02:37:20.961 --> 02:37:21.711
<v Speaker 6>don't fear it.</v>

5155
02:37:21.711 --> 02:37:24.480
<v Speaker 6>Don't you know how in 2001 it's here,</v>

5156
02:37:24.490 --> 02:37:24.750
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

5157
02:37:24.750 --> 02:37:26.570
<v Speaker 6>it's been happening for quite awhile.</v>

5158
02:37:26.750 --> 02:37:31.310
<v Speaker 6>Monsanto doesn't give a shit if they produce food that kills us.</v>

5159
02:37:31.340 --> 02:37:32.090
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5160
02:37:32.090 --> 02:37:33.860
<v Speaker 6>as long as they've cornered the market,</v>

5161
02:37:33.890 --> 02:37:35.990
<v Speaker 6>well they also produce DDT and Agent Orange.</v>

5162
02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:36.530
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

5163
02:37:36.530 --> 02:37:37.840
<v Speaker 6>So itself,</v>

5164
02:37:39.220 --> 02:37:42.350
<v Speaker 6>they've been making fucked up choices for a long time.</v>

5165
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:45.740
<v Speaker 6>You know what I told that story about the pilots in San Diego.</v>

5166
02:37:45.741 --> 02:37:49.820
<v Speaker 6>I was given a talk down there and this guy came up to me after and he said,</v>

5167
02:37:50.260 --> 02:37:50.660
<v Speaker 6>I'm a,</v>

5168
02:37:50.660 --> 02:37:51.280
<v Speaker 6>I'm A.</v>

5169
02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:53.210
<v Speaker 6>I was a fighter pilot in Vietnam.</v>

5170
02:37:53.570 --> 02:37:54.320
<v Speaker 6>Same thing.</v>

5171
02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:54.901
<v Speaker 6>Different war,</v>

5172
02:37:54.901 --> 02:37:55.550
<v Speaker 6>same thing.</v>

5173
02:37:55.550 --> 02:37:56.301
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

5174
02:37:56.301 --> 02:37:58.160
<v Speaker 6>So it's a natural behavior pattern.</v>

5175
02:37:58.220 --> 02:38:02.630
<v Speaker 6>Apparently it's a culture among fighter pilots that a,</v>

5176
02:38:02.810 --> 02:38:03.650
<v Speaker 6>they.</v>

5177
02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:05.540
<v Speaker 6>Well that they're facing death.</v>

5178
02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:05.980
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5179
02:38:05.980 --> 02:38:06.200
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

5180
02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:07.040
<v Speaker 6>and I found it.</v>

5181
02:38:07.041 --> 02:38:12.041
<v Speaker 6>I'd done a lot of research and hospitals and I found a very amplified sexuality</v>

5182
02:38:12.651 --> 02:38:15.930
<v Speaker 6>in hospitals center because they're facing as well.</v>

5183
02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:16.460
<v Speaker 6>Cops.</v>

5184
02:38:16.460 --> 02:38:16.721
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5185
02:38:16.721 --> 02:38:17.320
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

5186
02:38:17.320 --> 02:38:17.780
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5187
02:38:17.780 --> 02:38:18.111
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

5188
02:38:18.111 --> 02:38:20.870
<v Speaker 6>Anybody who's on the edge and Hulk Hogan,</v>

5189
02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:23.530
<v Speaker 6>Hulk Hogan Swim.</v>

5190
02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:24.620
<v Speaker 6>That MMA fighter.</v>

5191
02:38:24.650 --> 02:38:25.041
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5192
02:38:25.041 --> 02:38:25.401
<v Speaker 6>he's not.</v>

5193
02:38:25.401 --> 02:38:28.400
<v Speaker 6>He's just interviewed at the airport and just said something silly.</v>

5194
02:38:28.820 --> 02:38:30.260
<v Speaker 6>Everybody blew that out of proportion.</v>

5195
02:38:30.980 --> 02:38:31.341
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5196
02:38:31.341 --> 02:38:32.174
<v Speaker 6>Hulk Hogan,</v>

5197
02:38:32.370 --> 02:38:33.130
<v Speaker 6>they used to.</v>

5198
02:38:33.130 --> 02:38:34.070
<v Speaker 6>He was a web swapper.</v>

5199
02:38:34.900 --> 02:38:36.760
<v Speaker 6>The AG guys,</v>

5200
02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:38.780
<v Speaker 6>much of the.</v>

5201
02:38:39.270 --> 02:38:41.940
<v Speaker 6>Was it the New York jets and the giants had Ryan.</v>

5202
02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:43.233
<v Speaker 6>There was this.</v>

5203
02:38:43.530 --> 02:38:44.360
<v Speaker 6>Did you hear about this?</v>

5204
02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:44.820
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5205
02:38:44.820 --> 02:38:46.370
<v Speaker 6>this controversy because there were,</v>

5206
02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:49.190
<v Speaker 6>there were pictures on the Internet of him,</v>

5207
02:38:50.090 --> 02:38:52.130
<v Speaker 6>his wife and another dude,</v>

5208
02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:57.130
<v Speaker 6>and the wife was like either naked or in lingerie and the other dude was sucking</v>

5209
02:38:57.140 --> 02:38:57.790
<v Speaker 6>her toes.</v>

5210
02:38:57.790 --> 02:38:58.623
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

5211
02:38:58.650 --> 02:38:59.870
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ.</v>

5212
02:38:59.871 --> 02:39:01.340
<v Speaker 6>That's where I checked out</v>

5213
02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:05.190
<v Speaker 6>the glove.</v>

5214
02:39:05.190 --> 02:39:05.931
<v Speaker 6>Weird about that,</v>

5215
02:39:05.931 --> 02:39:06.231
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

5216
02:39:06.231 --> 02:39:07.400
<v Speaker 6>We're real weird about that.</v>

5217
02:39:07.430 --> 02:39:08.263
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting.</v>

5218
02:39:08.310 --> 02:39:09.170
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

5219
02:39:09.250 --> 02:39:09.491
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

5220
02:39:09.491 --> 02:39:12.790
<v Speaker 6>it's fascinating to just see the trends and how they've,</v>

5221
02:39:12.910 --> 02:39:14.960
<v Speaker 6>how they've changed with the environment.</v>

5222
02:39:15.180 --> 02:39:15.510
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5223
02:39:15.510 --> 02:39:18.870
<v Speaker 6>and how different they are as you were saying in cultures like there was a at</v>

5224
02:39:18.890 --> 02:39:22.880
<v Speaker 6>the same time that thing was happening in the states and it was a huge to do.</v>

5225
02:39:23.390 --> 02:39:28.390
<v Speaker 6>There was a soccer coach in England who got nabbed coming out of a massage</v>

5226
02:39:30.711 --> 02:39:35.711
<v Speaker 6>parlor with happy endings and all that and the press was there and snapping all</v>

5227
02:39:37.131 --> 02:39:39.020
<v Speaker 6>these pictures and they said,</v>

5228
02:39:39.050 --> 02:39:40.090
<v Speaker 6>do you know their tie?</v>

5229
02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:41.120
<v Speaker 6>How hookers in there?</v>

5230
02:39:41.121 --> 02:39:41.331
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

5231
02:39:41.331 --> 02:39:43.000
<v Speaker 6>of course I know die yolkers in this,</v>

5232
02:39:43.010 --> 02:39:43.141
<v Speaker 6>why?</v>

5233
02:39:43.141 --> 02:39:43.974
<v Speaker 6>I go there.</v>

5234
02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:45.050
<v Speaker 6>And it was like,</v>

5235
02:39:45.051 --> 02:39:45.350
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

5236
02:39:45.350 --> 02:39:46.940
<v Speaker 6>how dare you not be ashamed,</v>

5237
02:39:46.941 --> 02:39:47.181
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

5238
02:39:47.181 --> 02:39:50.390
<v Speaker 6>And then they went and interviewed his wife and his wife said,</v>

5239
02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:51.471
<v Speaker 6>Oh God,</v>

5240
02:39:51.471 --> 02:39:53.810
<v Speaker 6>if I could get him to go to Thai hookers twice a week,</v>

5241
02:39:53.811 --> 02:39:54.740
<v Speaker 6>I'd pay for it.</v>

5242
02:39:54.741 --> 02:39:55.790
<v Speaker 6>It relaxes him.</v>

5243
02:39:55.791 --> 02:39:57.020
<v Speaker 6>He's better at his job.</v>

5244
02:39:57.021 --> 02:39:57.291
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5245
02:39:57.291 --> 02:39:58.700
<v Speaker 6>how is this any of your business?</v>

5246
02:39:58.940 --> 02:40:01.250
<v Speaker 6>Just completely trumped the,</v>

5247
02:40:01.251 --> 02:40:01.540
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5248
02:40:01.540 --> 02:40:01.790
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5249
02:40:01.790 --> 02:40:02.120
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5250
02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:05.300
<v Speaker 6>the assumption that she'd be ashamed and run away from it.</v>

5251
02:40:05.301 --> 02:40:05.480
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

5252
02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:05.661
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

5253
02:40:05.661 --> 02:40:07.100
<v Speaker 6>this is none of your damn business.</v>

5254
02:40:07.490 --> 02:40:08.780
<v Speaker 6>Sounds like you've got a good wife.</v>

5255
02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:09.980
<v Speaker 6>Nailed it.</v>

5256
02:40:09.980 --> 02:40:11.600
<v Speaker 6>Imagine if the Clintons had done that.</v>

5257
02:40:12.290 --> 02:40:13.123
<v Speaker 6>Maybe they did in,</v>

5258
02:40:13.860 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 6>you</v>

5259
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:14.161
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

5260
02:40:14.161 --> 02:40:15.240
<v Speaker 4>maybe you think they did.</v>

5261
02:40:15.270 --> 02:40:18.000
<v Speaker 4>Maybe Hillary was just mad that he wasn't bringing checks home.</v>

5262
02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:19.801
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5263
02:40:19.801 --> 02:40:20.634
<v Speaker 4>who knows,</v>

5264
02:40:20.940 --> 02:40:24.480
<v Speaker 4>who fucking cares either those businesses.</v>

5265
02:40:24.590 --> 02:40:25.120
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5266
02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:30.120
<v Speaker 4>it's just so weird how the desire for sex and our appetite for sex is not</v>

5267
02:40:30.931 --> 02:40:32.660
<v Speaker 4>represented in any way.</v>

5268
02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:37.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's represented a bit in the media and film and advertising and stuff</v>

5269
02:40:37.681 --> 02:40:37.981
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

5270
02:40:37.981 --> 02:40:38.814
<v Speaker 4>but it's not.</v>

5271
02:40:38.910 --> 02:40:39.743
<v Speaker 4>Honestly,</v>

5272
02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:41.360
<v Speaker 4>it's not honestly engaged.</v>

5273
02:40:41.361 --> 02:40:42.750
<v Speaker 4>It's not honestly described.</v>

5274
02:40:42.750 --> 02:40:46.250
<v Speaker 2>It's funny though because like I saw this Carter or in a cartoon,</v>

5275
02:40:46.270 --> 02:40:51.270
<v Speaker 2>a commercial a couple of weeks ago for some plunger or some plumbing thing to</v>

5276
02:40:51.991 --> 02:40:53.870
<v Speaker 2>clear your drains and it,</v>

5277
02:40:53.871 --> 02:40:54.160
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5278
02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:55.230
<v Speaker 2>the idea was,</v>

5279
02:40:55.320 --> 02:40:55.800
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>

5280
02:40:55.800 --> 02:40:56.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5281
02:40:56.030 --> 02:41:01.030
<v Speaker 2>the whatever the major brand plumbing thing is and this stuff has the chemical</v>

5282
02:41:01.111 --> 02:41:01.681
<v Speaker 2>nastiness,</v>

5283
02:41:01.681 --> 02:41:05.610
<v Speaker 2>but it also has like a plastic thing you can stick down to pull the hair thing.</v>

5284
02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:07.830
<v Speaker 2>And so it was like double action.</v>

5285
02:41:07.950 --> 02:41:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5286
02:41:08.550 --> 02:41:09.900
<v Speaker 2>And so the ad was,</v>

5287
02:41:10.020 --> 02:41:13.410
<v Speaker 2>this woman answers the door and it's this really good looking dude,</v>

5288
02:41:13.411 --> 02:41:14.011
<v Speaker 2>and the dude's like,</v>

5289
02:41:14.011 --> 02:41:14.161
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5290
02:41:14.161 --> 02:41:16.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to snake your drain baby.</v>

5291
02:41:16.410 --> 02:41:16.951
<v Speaker 2>And she says,</v>

5292
02:41:16.951 --> 02:41:17.490
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>

5293
02:41:17.490 --> 02:41:18.031
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

5294
02:41:18.031 --> 02:41:18.811
<v Speaker 2>all flustered in,</v>

5295
02:41:18.811 --> 02:41:19.231

<v Speaker 2>come with me.</v>

5297
02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:21.980
<v Speaker 2>And then someone else knocks and she opened it.</v>

5298
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:22.771
<v Speaker 2>It's another dude.</v>

5299
02:41:22.771 --> 02:41:23.131
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

5300
02:41:23.131 --> 02:41:23.401
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5301
