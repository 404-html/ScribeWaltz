<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

53
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:14.280

<v Speaker 1>bit to understand it,</v>

54
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:16.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's sort of part of the joke </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost.</v>

55
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.350
<v Speaker 1>They're making parody of the craziness </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it all by just throwing their brand </v>

56
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>name on stuff and people are buying into</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

89
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.750

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.851
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real story about the godfather and </v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I waited in line to go see star</v>

94
00:03:57.881 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 2>wars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not in three fucking days.</v>

95
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Camped out the night before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

96
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 2>not for a hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did they camp out for back then?</v>

97
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.320
<v Speaker 2>It kept that for something really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the first I ever saw it was a </v>

98
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 2>iphones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the first iphone were out,</v>

99
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 2>I remember going to the mall and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck am I seeing?</v>

100
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.160
<v Speaker 2>And there was a giant line outside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>apple store and this was like one.</v>

101
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:24.480
<v Speaker 2>One of the first iphone was coming out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

102
00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 2>why are you waiting for a phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a phone already.</v>

103
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Is this the only way to get the phone?</v>

104
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all so confusing,</v>

105
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 2>but it was a thing where people would </v>
<v Speaker 2>wait in line and then they would look at</v>

106
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:39.241
<v Speaker 2>each other and I remember when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when they were waiting in </v>

107
00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 2>line for Harry Potter when Harry Potter </v>
<v Speaker 2>was coming out and people would drive by</v>

108
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 2>and they were yelling out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumbledore dies at the end.</v>

109
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 2>They're yelling out all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>spoilers.</v>

110
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.380
<v Speaker 2>All I typed in was waiting in line for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in Google and the only things that </v>

111
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 2>come up or iphone supreme and iphone </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight or gas.</v>

<v Speaker 2>gas.</v>

113
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 2>We waited in line with the flags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Red,</v>

114
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 2>green or yellow flag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>

115
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.430

116
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.911
<v Speaker 2>there was a gas shortage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So green meant that you got gas if you </v>

<v Speaker 2>have an odd number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you license play them,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

121
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 2>But that they had the flags 73 to 75 </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe something like that.</v>

122
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the exact dates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they had a weird line.</v>

123
00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fifty four had a huge one,</v>

124
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.610
<v Speaker 2>but you got picked studio 54.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dance club studio.</v>

00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 2>50 floor was on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You showed up.</v>

126
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 2>You didn't guarantee to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got picked right the way they do now</v>

127
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 2>in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they pick hot chicks,</v>

128
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they pick hot chicks.</v>

129
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:45.310

<v Speaker 2>when they.</v>

130

<v Speaker 2>business like try to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes something hot and what doesn't.</v>

211
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:29.931

<v Speaker 2>them and reopening and grand reopening </v>

212
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:35.121

<v Speaker 2>Like I remember hearing that they were </v>

213
00:09:35.121 --> 00:09:38.781
<v Speaker 2>paying Paris Hilton like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Piles of money to just show up at club </v>

214
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.840

<v Speaker 2>club gets hot.</v>

216
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Then after about a year you started </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking partners and yeah,</v>

00:16:13.751 --> 00:16:16.211
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know if I control this </v>

349
00:16:16.211 --> 00:16:17.510
<v Speaker 3>feeling and I control it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you like when you quit,</v>

350
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.560
<v Speaker 3>what was like the first week like hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hell,</v>

351
00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:26.620
<v Speaker 3>first two weeks were hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you think about going back just </v>

352
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:26.620
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do this,</v>

353
00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.060
<v Speaker 3>or did you know that you had had to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>a change?</v>

354
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.990
<v Speaker 3>I had to make a change.</v>

355
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.120
<v Speaker 3>I knew that my spine was starting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt.</v>

356
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:37.300
<v Speaker 3>I knew the spineless started hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to get job just by four in </v>

357
00:16:37.401 --> 00:16:38.120
<v Speaker 3>the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

358
00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:40.970
<v Speaker 3>after you do coke right at the tip over </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

359
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:45.020
<v Speaker 3>people have done coke at like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Parkinson's gives a fuck that.</v>

360
00:16:45.021 --> 00:16:45.320
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

361
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:45.550
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

362
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:46.220
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once.</v>

363
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:51.280
<v Speaker 3>I think that's related while a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of old timers that did a lot of </v>

364
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.160
<v Speaker 3>coke in the seventies and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>wound up like some serious neuromuscular</v>

365
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.210
<v Speaker 3>Muskegon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolute.</v>

366
00:16:56.211 --> 00:16:58.400
<v Speaker 3>That shit's shocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just central nervous system.</v>

367
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.640
<v Speaker 3>There was times I did cocaine that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>electric.</v>

368
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.240
<v Speaker 3>It was like when you put that thing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your hand or you get electrocuted,</v>

369
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:11.270
<v Speaker 3>you could feel the electric and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body and next day like that in your </v>

370
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:17.230
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can actually see the neural </v>

371
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:18.380
<v Speaker 3>transmitters a fucking on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could feel that.</v>

372
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:23.890
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could tell when I would go on stage </v>

373
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:23.890
<v Speaker 3>after doing two or three nights of blow </v>
<v Speaker 3>that week,</v>

374
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:28.390
<v Speaker 3>I had no control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really had no control over my </v>

375
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.300
<v Speaker 3>material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no control over my delivery.</v>

376
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.650
<v Speaker 3>That's what I wanted to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're just the way you off.</v>

377
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your mind can't grip it.</v>

378
00:17:35.961 --> 00:17:39.440
<v Speaker 3>You can't sell the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The facial doesn't connect with the hand</v>

379
00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:43.340
<v Speaker 3>movement or the breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

380
00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:46.010
<v Speaker 3>I knew that that was always going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>a danger in the future.</v>

381
00:17:46.011 --> 00:17:46.690
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

382
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.690

389
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it felt good.</v>

390
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.120
<v Speaker 3>It felt a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give your brain some nutrient control.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>off coke.</v>

395
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:25.551
<v Speaker 3>I was doing the heroin that was trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get off the coke and shit and then </v>

00:18:25.551 --> 00:18:28.941
<v Speaker 3>that September I read the heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was doing it like maybe once a week</v>

<v Speaker 3>Maryland.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I knew I had to stop and then I had this</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing in hoboken.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>

401
00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.580
<v Speaker 3>I went back east that week and she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>dying.</v>

402
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:42.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

403
00:18:42.841 --> 00:18:47.841
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to get coke on Friday </v>

404
00:18:47.841 --> 00:18:47.841
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get it and I just took it for</v>

405
00:18:47.841 --> 00:18:47.841
<v Speaker 3>what it was.</v>

406
00:18:47.841 --> 00:18:49.590
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to get coconut Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get it,</v>

407
00:18:49.591 --> 00:18:52.200
<v Speaker 3>so fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took the plane back Sunday.</v>

408
00:18:52.201 --> 00:18:53.910
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get it here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something happened.</v>

409
00:18:53.911 --> 00:18:58.911
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that Monday I had a meeting to </v>

410
00:18:58.911 --> 00:19:00.180
<v Speaker 3>do a movie and at the end of the meeting</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy said,</v>

411
00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:02.880
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know about your drug problem.</v>

412
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:09.250
<v Speaker 3>So before you say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want you to think about this because </v>

413
00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.441
<v Speaker 3>you can't miss a day on this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot be late if you're late to the</v>

414
00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:15.300
<v Speaker 3>whole movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't shoot because it was a cast.</v>

415
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.790
<v Speaker 3>We all shot in one room was in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting,</v>

416
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.560
<v Speaker 3>so I thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it and that was the roughest </v>

417
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.890
<v Speaker 3>fucking month because I was just going </v>
<v Speaker 3>home and before 8:00</v>

418
00:19:25.891 --> 00:19:28.320
<v Speaker 3>would start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just go to bed.</v>

419
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 3>At 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>was my cocaine time.</v>

420
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.180
<v Speaker 3>That's what my body would start to ache.</v>

421
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:38.350
<v Speaker 3>That's when I couldn't even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could be telling me the most </v>

422
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:38.350
<v Speaker 3>important thing in your life and I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching you,</v>

423
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:43.261
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All my mind was focused on was getting </v>

424
00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:46.761
<v Speaker 3>that blow at 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I would figure out how to get </v>

425
00:19:46.761 --> 00:19:46.860
<v Speaker 3>to 60 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

426
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:52.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go to the ATM machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would shoot over the rock and roll </v>

427
00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.681
<v Speaker 3>routes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an ATM machine in front of rock </v>

428
00:19:54.681 --> 00:19:54.681
<v Speaker 3>and roll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ralph's right there.</v>

429
00:19:54.681 --> 00:19:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would take 60 bucks out there.</v>

430
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:58.620
<v Speaker 3>I would rather you red light to get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ATM machine,</v>

431
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.250
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We to give a fuck.</v>

432
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.190
<v Speaker 3>And then from there we just make the u </v>
<v Speaker 3>turn,</v>

433
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.610
<v Speaker 3>go to my dealer's house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go home and leave the coke there and now</v>

434
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:13.611
<v Speaker 3>is ready for the night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in peace just knowing that the </v>

435
00:20:13.611 --> 00:20:13.611
<v Speaker 3>coke was at the house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have to do it.</v>

436
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

437
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.760
<v Speaker 5>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never been physically addicted to </v>

438
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:19.760
<v Speaker 5>something in a way where I had a hard </v>
<v Speaker 5>time kicking it.</v>

439
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.400
<v Speaker 5>But I've had some psychological </v>
<v Speaker 5>addictions for sure.</v>

440
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.760
<v Speaker 5>And I think that one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've gotten out of this month of no </v>

441
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:33.400
<v Speaker 5>sober October thing that Tom Burton,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ari and I are doing is that a lot of it </v>

442
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.670
<v Speaker 5>is psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of it is psychological.</v>

443
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.210
<v Speaker 5>It's just knowing that we can't smoke </v>
<v Speaker 5>pot or can't drink all month.</v>

444
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.860
<v Speaker 5>You start thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

445
00:20:39.861 --> 00:20:42.310
<v Speaker 5>we're at the homestretch November first </v>
<v Speaker 5>round the corner.</v>

446
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.900
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't really feel like I need to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get high.</v>

447
00:20:44.901 --> 00:20:46.970
<v Speaker 5>It's not like our needed a drink </v>
<v Speaker 5>tomorrow,</v>

448
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.910
<v Speaker 5>but it's knowing that I can't do it for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the month where it hangs over your head.</v>

449
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:57.090
<v Speaker 5>So that's what's even more impressive </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you could kick it because it's not </v>

450
00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.340
<v Speaker 5>just the fact that you have like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>physical problem,</v>

451
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.130
<v Speaker 5>but you also have the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem,</v>

452
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:08.370
<v Speaker 5>like the psychological part of it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's a pattern that you're </v>

453
00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:08.370
<v Speaker 5>comfortable with.</v>

454
00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.870
<v Speaker 5>You got used to that pattern of 8:00,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you looking for the coke,</v>

455
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Speaker 5>you go and do it and then you're off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're off.</v>

456
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:18.870
<v Speaker 5>Even though you're in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your life's in disarray and you're in </v>

457
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:19.870
<v Speaker 5>the grips of addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're comfortable with that feeling.</v>

458
00:21:19.871 --> 00:21:22.480
<v Speaker 5>You've been there before and you're for </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever reason,</v>

459
00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:24.730
<v Speaker 5>when people get used to fucking up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they go,</v>

460
00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:29.731
<v Speaker 5>why do I keep fucking up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the reasons you keep fucking up </v>

461
00:21:29.731 --> 00:21:30.910
<v Speaker 5>because you're used to fuck us it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's not an uncomfortable feeling in</v>

462
00:21:30.911 --> 00:21:32.800

<v Speaker 5>They're buying things so that they could</v>
<v Speaker 5>bring places and other people would go,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I guess a successful feeling.</v>

554
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:39.510
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get a feeling from other people </v>

<v Speaker 5>recognizing that they have the latest </v>

<v Speaker 5>talk about shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All they talk about is objects.</v>

573
00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:29.290
<v Speaker 5>It's talking about this object and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>object and how much this is worth and </v>

574
00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.771
<v Speaker 5>how much real estate's going for here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the whole focus of </v>

575
00:26:32.771 --> 00:26:36.311
<v Speaker 5>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like an anti human conversation </v>

576
00:26:36.311 --> 00:26:36.770
<v Speaker 5>because they're not talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything human.</v>

577
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.200
<v Speaker 5>They're not talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

578
00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:44.210

579
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.710
<v Speaker 5>experiences as a parent and none of that</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

580
00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.630
<v Speaker 5>a lot of them don't even pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 5>to their kids.</v>

581
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:49.320
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

582
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:54.440
<v Speaker 5>they go and drink and leave the kids </v>
<v Speaker 5>outside and the kids are just fucking </v>

583
00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.940
<v Speaker 5>hitting other kids with sticks and shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>and go and study and then when they come</v>

<v Speaker 5>he doesn't do that.</v>

586
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.650
<v Speaker 5>Then they go back inside and drink more </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's like crazy.</v>

587
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.980
<v Speaker 5>It's really interesting to see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the things that fuel success </v>

588
00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.290
<v Speaker 5>in a lot of people are a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>folks.</v>

589
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:15.291
<v Speaker 5>It's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this need for material possessions and </v>

590
00:27:15.291 --> 00:27:18.090
<v Speaker 5>then pills and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is what's going on.</v>

00:27:43.791 --> 00:27:43.791
<v Speaker 5>these fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As a parent,</v>

601
00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:46.200
<v Speaker 5>like I'm sitting there every day now </v>

<v Speaker 5>and I'm like,</v>

606
00:27:57.211 --> 00:28:02.211
<v Speaker 5>my mother was a fucking booky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My mother on the ball and she was a </v>

<v Speaker 5>drunk and she was way better parents and</v>
<v Speaker 5>these fucking cops because she was </v>

608
00:28:06.531 --> 00:28:08.960
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Interest is what it is.</v>

609
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.340
<v Speaker 5>I think what we're talking about with </v>
<v Speaker 5>this pill thing,</v>

610
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:13.770
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people that are on </v>
<v Speaker 5>antidepressants.</v>

611
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.080
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that are on </v>
<v Speaker 5>adderall does.</v>

612
00:28:16.081 --> 00:28:21.081
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people are on Xanax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that are a lot </v>

613
00:28:21.081 --> 00:28:23.580
<v Speaker 5>of weird disassociated lives and these </v>
<v Speaker 5>disassociative pills,</v>

614
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.580
<v Speaker 5>you see it in how they interact with </v>
<v Speaker 5>their children.</v>

615
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.370
<v Speaker 5>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just zone out.</v>

616
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:34.700
<v Speaker 5>They're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if you're like stressed out about </v>

617
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:34.700
<v Speaker 5>your kid and you're interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 5>your kid,</v>

618
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.261
<v Speaker 5>at least the kid knows you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>communicating with them and then the </v>

619
00:28:39.261 --> 00:28:39.261
<v Speaker 5>kids probably not happy that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>stressed out,</v>

620
00:28:39.261 --> 00:28:43.191
<v Speaker 5>but at least you're there when you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>zoned out on pills and staring at the </v>

621
00:28:43.191 --> 00:28:43.191
<v Speaker 5>fucking clouds.</v>

622
00:28:43.191 --> 00:28:45.450
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just not.</v>

623
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:50.930
<v Speaker 5>It's not a good way for human beings to </v>
<v Speaker 5>interact with each other while you're </v>

624
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.000
<v Speaker 5>hopped up on some weird shit and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>

625
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:59.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the actual numbers </v>

626
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:00.771
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but are in the communities that I </v>

627
00:29:00.771 --> 00:29:02.871
<v Speaker 5>associate with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say a good solid half of these </v>

628
00:29:02.871 --> 00:29:03.690
<v Speaker 5>fucking people are pilled up a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>solid half.</v>

<v Speaker 5>to some of these people and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

725
00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:06.590
<v Speaker 2>didn't have too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I went to prison,</v>

726
00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.930
<v Speaker 2>the hardest thing about prison wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to prison.</v>

727
00:33:08.931 --> 00:33:13.931
<v Speaker 2>You know it was,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I wasn't worried about nothing else in </v>

730
00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:19.810
<v Speaker 2>prison except marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get any in prison.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I wasn't doing that,</v>

733
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.290

<v Speaker 2>about yourself.</v>

734
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:33.220
<v Speaker 2>You learned that you could go with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the strongest things </v>

735
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.580
<v Speaker 2>that could happen to somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you're.</v>

736
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:38.360
<v Speaker 2>When you're in love with that girl and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're destroying your life,</v>

737
00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:40.160

<v Speaker 2>your drink,</v>

738
00:33:40.161 --> 00:33:43.850
<v Speaker 2>and you act like an asshole and then she</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes away to Hawaii for two weeks.</v>

739
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:46.700
<v Speaker 2>After 10 days you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that bitch.</v>

740
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.420
<v Speaker 2>When you did people get divorced when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they lot.</v>

741

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

742
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:54.950
<v Speaker 2>The wife goes back to see the mother.</v>

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:56.550
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I doing?</v>

744
00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm much happier in this house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could put her in the back somewhere </v>

745
00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.841
<v Speaker 2>and not see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know that's what happens when you </v>

746
00:34:05.841 --> 00:34:06.140
<v Speaker 2>realize you could do without.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the biggest things in your</v>

747
00:34:06.141 --> 00:34:09.020
<v Speaker 2>world that could happen to date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea.</v>

748
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't think you could do without in </v>

749
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.230
<v Speaker 2>the beginning because you think maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could possibly get her back.</v>

750
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.570
<v Speaker 2>If you can get it back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's going to go.</v>

751
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.810
<v Speaker 2>You got this bad feeling because she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about leaving.</v>

752
00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:17.570
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

753
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:19.740
<v Speaker 2>she's going to leave Melbourne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I can talk her back in.</v>

754
00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I could buy or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I can do something.</v>

755
00:34:21.481 --> 00:34:26.481
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we changed my weights and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring her back and I'll bring her back </v>

756
00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:28.700
<v Speaker 2>and everything's gonna be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everything is fine and if she leaves</v>

757
00:34:28.701 --> 00:34:31.820
<v Speaker 2>you just meet somebody else.</v>

00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:58.020
<v Speaker 2>I put my feet through the handles and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I put two in my hands and I lay </v>

1065

<v Speaker 2>back on my back and I press them up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I sit up with impressed up and I do</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't tie my feet and what I do is I </v>

1069
00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:13.600
<v Speaker 2>go back and then we'll go this way.</v>

1070
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:16.290
<v Speaker 2>I do like a fucking burpee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I grew up on my back,</v>

1073
00:48:19.331 --> 00:48:22.220
<v Speaker 2>but I do that and then stand back up all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way up.</v>

1074
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:23.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1075
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.540

<v Speaker 2>Go back in the band,</v>

1076
00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.710
<v Speaker 2>but at least it's like getting onto the </v>
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>

1077
00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:35.180
<v Speaker 2>That's what getting into a table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to the strength and all that </v>

1078
00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.500
<v Speaker 2>shit and that helped me strengthen my </v>
<v Speaker 2>back doing that stuff.</v>

1079
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Those are great workouts because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

1080
00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a glamorous thing where </v>
<v Speaker 2>pumps you up,</v>

1081
00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:42.880

<v Speaker 2>It makes it look Jack,</v>

1082
00:48:42.881 --> 00:48:46.090
<v Speaker 2>but it's just great for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>circulation.</v>

1083
00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:48.580
<v Speaker 2>Then I told her the bag in the.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and you're pressing something up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>even just getting up to your knee,</v>

1111
00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:55.810
<v Speaker 2>it's all just about strengthening your </v>

<v Speaker 2>with the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1117
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:10.470
<v Speaker 2>I start with nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I worked myself up to a 35 </v>

1118
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.470
<v Speaker 2>goblet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>The left one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right one now is a little funky.</v>

1123
00:50:17.291 --> 00:50:20.020
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I love cleans with kettlebells.</v>

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I was going to take the door off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then got and then just decided to do </v>

1138
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:56.690

<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>

1139
00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:58.700
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>realized from this,</v>

1140
00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:04.080
<v Speaker 2>doing the 15 yoga classes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would fucking never do nine yoga </v>

1141
00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:06.410
<v Speaker 2>classes in a row like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never do nine days in a row.</v>

1142
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:11.430
<v Speaker 2>And last I said I was going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once you say you're going to do </v>

1143
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:12.500
<v Speaker 2>something and you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that hard.</v>

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:14.210
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just wind up doing it,</v>

1145
00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have to do it.</v>

1146
00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:18.830
<v Speaker 2>Like my alarm goes off at seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out the door,</v>

1147
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I get to the class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do the fucking 90 minute class and </v>

1148
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:26.681
<v Speaker 2>then I'm done and then I'd go do my shit</v>

<v Speaker 2>Couple grams of sugar per coconut milk.</v>

00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:23.040
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that one.</v>

1174
00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:25.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind doing the challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem,</v>

1175
00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>

1176
00:52:26.841 --> 00:52:28.580
<v Speaker 2>What happens that a lot of people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize?</v>

1177
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:30.110
<v Speaker 2>I go to Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1178
00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Let's say I go to Alberto's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alberto's has some fucking killers in </v>

1179
00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.070
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll do the break.</v>

1180
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:38.300
<v Speaker 2>The guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pass the guard,</v>

1181
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:43.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of those and then we start </v>

1182
00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:45.581
<v Speaker 2>rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will a guy like me and an older guy </v>

1183
00:52:45.581 --> 00:52:46.070
<v Speaker 2>starts rolling that for the second five </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute roll.</v>

1184
00:52:46.071 --> 00:52:48.050
<v Speaker 2>He's opened up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1185
00:52:48.051 --> 00:52:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm open.</v>

1186
00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.380
<v Speaker 2>Like I called dolce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which my problem,</v>

1187
00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:54.320
<v Speaker 2>how come I'm not breathing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1188
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:59.500
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to work them out in the back for </v>

1189
00:52:59.500 --> 00:52:59.500
<v Speaker 2>45 minutes before.</v>

1190
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Because they can't breathe either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1191
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.840
<v Speaker 2>just go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I do more than those two roles is.</v>

1192
00:53:03.841 --> 00:53:07.580
<v Speaker 2>So law diminishing returns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really can't walk the next day.</v>

1193
00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:08.450
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard,</v>

1194
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.250
<v Speaker 2>but you got to build up to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to build up to it.</v>

1195
00:53:10.251 --> 00:53:13.130
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I liked the southern guy in a</v>

1196
00:53:13.131 --> 00:53:16.040
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you work one day,</v>

1197
00:53:16.041 --> 00:53:18.470
<v Speaker 2>you drill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what day you work.</v>

1198
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:23.300
<v Speaker 2>I could do a wait shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I like wait shit.</v>

1199
00:53:23.301 --> 00:53:26.630
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking of joining your buddy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gym for a really good workout.</v>

<v Speaker 2>all these issues,</v>

1220
00:54:16.321 --> 00:54:18.510
<v Speaker 2>but then once he starts hitting the bag </v>

<v Speaker 2>will see it all and see the war in their</v>

1235

1236
00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:57.600
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weird ticks and the movements.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1238
00:54:58.171 --> 00:55:00.630
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a frazzled person there.</v>

1239
00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:05.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're shattered to Jamie show you the </v>

1240
00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:08.091
<v Speaker 2>hit from last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one you watch the football last </v>

1241
00:55:08.091 --> 00:55:08.091
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody gets smashed or uh,</v>

1243
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:17.420
<v Speaker 2>but you know what's crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was football thing years ago now </v>

1244
00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:19.680
<v Speaker 2>that fucking done like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit this hard anymore though.</v>

1245
00:55:19.681 --> 00:55:20.840
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1246
00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:21.960
<v Speaker 2>how'd this guy get hit so hard?</v>

1247
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

1248
00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:26.080
<v Speaker 1>the main issue on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I could say,</v>

1249
00:55:26.081 --> 00:55:28.200
<v Speaker 1>a quarterback play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do the thing where they are,</v>

1250
00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I guess they're called Kit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's giving up their body.</v>

1251
00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:32.700
<v Speaker 1>They slide with their legs first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not supposed to get hit,</v>

1252
00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:38.490
<v Speaker 1>like in almost anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe supposed to tap them just to like </v>

1253
00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:38.620
<v Speaker 1>let another down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1254
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:43.670
<v Speaker 1>so this guy gives up his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see if I can find the video to </v>

1255
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.670
<v Speaker 1>try and that while I'm talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1256
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:46.020
<v Speaker 1>he gets hit really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>

1257
00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:51.050
<v Speaker 1>And then when you see it in slow Mo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of makes it a little worse </v>

1258
00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:51.530
<v Speaker 1>because the dude lead with design arm to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them right in the home.</v>

1259
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:54.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes like this job you seeing,</v>

1260
00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.410
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

1261
00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And throw them out.</v>

1262
00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't watch the game when I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>up this morning.</v>

1263
00:56:00.721 --> 00:56:02.970
<v Speaker 2>It was all over the place at late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It laid it.</v>

1264
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.050
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if one day they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to figure this.</v>

1265
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:06.090
<v Speaker 2>Is it right here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1266
00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Running Tome.</v>

1267
00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that Guy Mad?</v>

1268
00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:15.400
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a late hit.</v>

1269
00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:17.270
<v Speaker 1>They got furious at them.</v>

1270
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll say they're going to show it </v>

1271
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.950
<v Speaker 2>from other angles and you'll see</v>

1272
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:24.850
<v Speaker 1>technic quarterbacks a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy that hit him.</v>

1273
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.650
<v Speaker 1>40 seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kiki Alonzo.</v>

1274
00:56:27.651 --> 00:56:29.980
<v Speaker 1>I thinks his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kiko.</v>

1275
00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:33.600
<v Speaker 2>That's the guy who got hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Flacco for the Ravens.</v>

1276
00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's running.</v>

1277
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:36.090
<v Speaker 2>He's running.</v>

1278
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:39.620
<v Speaker 1>This is the angle for.</v>

1279
00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was already coming like,</v>

1280
00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:45.060
<v Speaker 2>how's he going to stop it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

1281
00:56:45.061 --> 00:56:47.010
<v Speaker 2>That's the part about the slide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feet first.</v>

1282
00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.530
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be like you're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop.</v>

1283
00:56:49.531 --> 00:56:51.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like kicking a fighter when their </v>
<v Speaker 2>arms are down kind of thing.</v>

1284
00:56:51.991 --> 00:56:56.991
<v Speaker 2>It's a rough time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know that they changed the rule </v>

1285
00:56:56.991 --> 00:56:56.991
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sort of same kind of thing where</v>

1286
00:56:56.991 --> 00:56:59.220
<v Speaker 2>he hit that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though the dude was already down,</v>

1287
00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:03.370
<v Speaker 2>the guy went down on his own accord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lets him sliding feet first.</v>

1288
00:57:03.371 --> 00:57:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's not supposed to be hitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>him like that.</v>

1289
00:57:05.011 --> 00:57:07.170
<v Speaker 2>He should know better is what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why everyone was mad.</v>

1290
00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.630
<v Speaker 2>That's why these coaches yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just took a cheap shot at him.</v>

1291
00:57:09.631 --> 00:57:10.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1292
00:57:10.381 --> 00:57:12.330
<v Speaker 2>And he hit him really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked him right out of the game.</v>

1293
00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:16.080
<v Speaker 2>So what happens to that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty seven.</v>

1294
00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:17.440
<v Speaker 2>He gets a fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1295
00:57:17.610 --> 00:57:20.220
<v Speaker 2>That dude's spread that for three or </v>
<v Speaker 2>four games.</v>

1296
00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:22.410
<v Speaker 2>He got his bell rung.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1297
00:57:22.411 --> 00:57:24.120
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucked up thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1298
00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:27.110
<v Speaker 2>In College football.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're taking them.</v>

1299
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:28.670
<v Speaker 2>They're taking them out of the game </v>
<v Speaker 2>right away.</v>

1300
00:57:28.671 --> 00:57:30.980
<v Speaker 2>He would have been probably thrown </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly out of the game,</v>

1301
00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:32.170
<v Speaker 2>potentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot Moore,</v>

1302
00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:37.720
<v Speaker 2>maybe half the next game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they give a penalty to the other </v>

1303
00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:37.720
<v Speaker 2>team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1304
00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.480
<v Speaker 2>So in the NFL right now it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>penalty.</v>

1305
00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Football referees are on the take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of these guys get busted?</v>

1306
00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a big thing about NBA </v>
<v Speaker 2>players.</v>

1307
00:57:46.401 --> 00:57:51.401
<v Speaker 2>I was reading this whole thing about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>little NBA players make and how they're </v>

1308
00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:52.940
<v Speaker 2>constantly watched all these MBA or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>mba players,</v>

1309
00:57:52.941 --> 00:57:57.941
<v Speaker 2>NBA referees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and other watching all these players </v>

1310
00:57:57.941 --> 00:58:00.491
<v Speaker 2>pull up and bentleys and rolls royces </v>
<v Speaker 2>and shining with diamonds and gold and </v>

1311
00:58:00.831 --> 00:58:05.831
<v Speaker 2>jewelry and that these guys just start </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking bribes and that there is one </v>

1312
00:58:06.591 --> 00:58:11.591
<v Speaker 2>point in time where there's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shitload of referees in the NFL and the </v>

1313
00:58:11.591 --> 00:58:15.911
<v Speaker 2>NBA that are just on the take and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll get bribed by bookies.</v>

1314
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:20.750
<v Speaker 2>They'll get bribed by people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>big time gamblers.</v>

1315
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:23.060
<v Speaker 2>And you've got to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this guy's only making,</v>

1316
00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:24.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much does a referee make?</v>

1317
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:29.090
<v Speaker 2>So somewhere between anywhere between </v>
<v Speaker 2>150 and 500,000.</v>

1318
00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:32.300
<v Speaker 2>That's a good living with someone comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>

1319
00:58:32.301 --> 00:58:33.950
<v Speaker 2>If you make 115,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone comes to me,</v>

1320
00:58:33.951 --> 00:58:34.560
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey,</v>

1321
00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:38.930
<v Speaker 2>just want you to make this game a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit more easy for the dolphins.</v>

1322
00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Here's a hundred acres.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much they make per group per year.</v>

1323
00:58:43.191 --> 00:58:45.380
<v Speaker 2>And some players there make that per </v>
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

1324
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:47.540
<v Speaker 2>Now pull up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1325
00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:53.920
<v Speaker 2>bribery in NBA referees or corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And NBA referees,</v>

1326
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:56.900
<v Speaker 2>it's been a bunch of guys that had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>busted.</v>

1327
00:58:56.901 --> 00:58:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about a bunch.</v>

1328
00:58:58.881 --> 00:59:00.950
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really just the one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one.</v>

1329
00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:02.510
<v Speaker 2>He tried to call out a bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1330
00:59:02.511 --> 00:59:05.760
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't do it by name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I talked to them.</v>

1331
00:59:05.761 --> 00:59:08.510
<v Speaker 2>That guy did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys know shit.</v>

1332
00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:11.630
<v Speaker 2>What'd he say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a good guy.</v>

1333
00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:15.620
<v Speaker 2>He's just a fucking listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fall into that trap.</v>

1334
00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:19.640
<v Speaker 2>They have so many scams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was telling me they got like the</v>

1335
00:59:19.641 --> 00:59:21.430
<v Speaker 2>first class tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit [inaudible],</v>

1336
00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:22.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1337
00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:25.270
<v Speaker 1>where they give you a first class ticket</v>
<v Speaker 1>to travel to a games is so much.</v>

1338
00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Just a little bit of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of this,</v>

1339
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:28.390
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1340
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Well there was always a lot of that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing as well in college basketball,</v>

1341
00:59:32.841 --> 00:59:37.841
<v Speaker 1>just like this is a tremendous coaches </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some different programs and I think </v>

1342
00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:40.820
<v Speaker 1>it was adidas might've been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were playing.</v>

1343
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Families were getting paid through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoe companies to direct players to </v>

1344
00:59:46.611 --> 00:59:51.611
<v Speaker 1>certain schools and then they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting signed by those companies when </v>

1345
00:59:51.611 --> 00:59:53.870
<v Speaker 1>they made it to the NBA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in some cases,</v>

1346
00:59:53.871 --> 00:59:58.871
<v Speaker 1>I think Rick Pitino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the coach for Louisville is taking </v>

1347
00:59:58.871 --> 01:00:01.301
<v Speaker 1>something like 98 percent or 95 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the money that was due to the school </v>

1348
01:00:01.301 --> 01:00:03.050
<v Speaker 1>from Adidas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just keeping it all.</v>

1349
01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.330
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1350
01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:07.280
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1351
01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1352
01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legal is a weird word on that.</v>

1353
01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's in the contract and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like cash and paying him basically.</v>

1354
01:00:19.611 --> 01:00:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go back to the movie blue chips,</v>

1355
01:00:22.401 --> 01:00:24.680
<v Speaker 1>which came out a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all being.</v>

1356
01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>It was like fictional then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's been going on for the last $25.</v>

1357
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Why would they pay him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do they,</v>

1358
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:32.600
<v Speaker 1>what do they get if adidas wants to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1359
01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:37.610
<v Speaker 1>what does the deed is get out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's bringing in the most popular </v>

1360
01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>players that are going to be like most </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular recruits from highschool and Aau</v>

1361
01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>and so that maybe he could bring them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>adidas and then Adidas.</v>

1362
01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:45.590
<v Speaker 1>You have them all in the final for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>NCAA tournament.</v>

1363
01:00:45.591 --> 01:00:46.910
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be on Saturday </v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball.</v>

1364
01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:48.770
<v Speaker 1>They're getting advertised just like NBA</v>
<v Speaker 1>players,</v>

1365
01:00:48.771 --> 01:00:53.320
<v Speaker 1>but they're not getting the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting their names in lights,</v>

1366
01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:54.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all over sports center,</v>

1367
01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:57.590
<v Speaker 1>so they essentially would adidas would </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay him to be an influencer.</v>

1368
01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:58.400
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1369
01:00:58.460 --> 01:00:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>

1370
01:00:59.751 --> 01:01:04.751
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he would be the father figure or the </v>

1371
01:01:04.751 --> 01:01:06.650
<v Speaker 1>coach figure to these young men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look up to him.</v>

1372
01:01:06.651 --> 01:01:08.600
<v Speaker 1>He's a mentor in some ways on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1373
01:01:08.601 --> 01:01:11.540
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he wheezes them into the adidas fold</v>

1374
01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:14.030
<v Speaker 1>and data what they want that they want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to wear.</v>

1375
01:01:14.031 --> 01:01:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Adidas cluff stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1376
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.090

<v Speaker 1>Lebron James Brand of Nike is giving </v>

1380
01:01:27.551 --> 01:01:29.270
<v Speaker 1>them that are going to be showcased all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over TV Saturday.</v>

1381
01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>I was reading it</v>

1382
01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:35.830
<v Speaker 2>about under armour is banking on Steph </v>
<v Speaker 2>Curry's new under armour shoe.</v>

1383
01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1384
01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Jamie so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were saying that steph curry,</v>

1385
01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:43.760
<v Speaker 2>who's like one of the best players in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the league,</v>

1386
01:01:43.761 --> 01:01:46.430
<v Speaker 2>apparently you know that more than I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know shit about basketball.</v>

1387
01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:51.100
<v Speaker 2>They were saying that his new under our </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mushu there,</v>

1388
01:01:51.101 --> 01:01:56.101
<v Speaker 2>they're putting a lot of money into this</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that his shoe is going to rebound </v>

1389
01:01:57.171 --> 01:02:02.171
<v Speaker 2>the stock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people are making recommendations to </v>

1390
01:02:02.171 --> 01:02:02.690
<v Speaker 2>buy under armour stock now so that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shoe comes out,</v>

1391
01:02:02.691 --> 01:02:06.650
<v Speaker 2>everybody gets crazy and buys his shoe </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then under armour will bounce back.</v>

1392
01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1393
01:02:08.131 --> 01:02:11.280
<v Speaker 1>the problem is once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once something has a stink about it,</v>

1394
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1395
01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:19.360
<v Speaker 1>that is that bad looking in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from knowing what I know about </v>

1396
01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.091
<v Speaker 1>sneakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not shoe that's going to bring </v>

1397
01:02:23.091 --> 01:02:23.091
<v Speaker 1>them back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1398
01:02:23.091 --> 01:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with that shoe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost a bunch of kids are into it,</v>

1399
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.810
<v Speaker 1>which I don't know that they would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more about marketing.</v>

1400
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>So you have to get a whole bunch of kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>into buying that.</v>

1401
01:02:31.111 --> 01:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>And then there's got to be a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>influencers in the like Mba,</v>

1402
01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.190
<v Speaker 1>video game world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1403
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:42.230
<v Speaker 1>like the youtube blogging world that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to make this seem cool to </v>

1404
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.890
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the influence.</v>

1405
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>What does it say Steph curry on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that 30 is number?</v>

1406
01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like an SC,</v>

1407
01:02:47.971 --> 01:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1408
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I guess I wouldn't wear these shoes is </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1409
01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>I have so much fucking money in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sneaker business.</v>

1410
01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't wear those shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wear those goofy looking yeezys.</v>

1411
01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I also like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't wear these casually.</v>

1412
01:03:00.721 --> 01:03:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not playing basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you need a tissue?</v>

1413
01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:05.640
<v Speaker 1>So if some people might be wearing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>for basketball,</v>

1414
01:03:05.641 --> 01:03:07.320
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of kids still playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball.</v>

1415
01:03:07.590 --> 01:03:12.590
<v Speaker 1>If they can get a team into buying them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get 15 pairs sold that to a </v>

1416
01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:13.410
<v Speaker 1>team and you're talking about two </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different worlds,</v>

1417
01:03:13.411 --> 01:03:15.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about there's people that</v>

1418
01:03:15.361 --> 01:03:20.361
<v Speaker 1>buy shoes to wear to play in casual or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's people that buy shoes </v>

1419
01:03:20.911 --> 01:03:22.170
<v Speaker 1>just to hang out in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct?</v>

1420
01:03:22.171 --> 01:03:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're doing them.</v>

1421
01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:26.730
<v Speaker 1>They're buying athletic shoes for </v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out purposes.</v>

1422
01:03:26.731 --> 01:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these,</v>

1423
01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:33.740
<v Speaker 1>the marketing of it is a real weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>place because Jordan's are where it all </v>

1424
01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:37.761
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jordan got everybody wearing </v>

1425
01:03:37.761 --> 01:03:37.761
<v Speaker 1>shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1426
01:03:37.761 --> 01:03:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jordan's people don't play </v>

1427
01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>basketball and Jordans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct or no?</v>

1428
01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.100
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1429
01:03:41.101 --> 01:03:43.460
<v Speaker 1>they don't do it because you look cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were a Jew.</v>

1430
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>You're wearing those fucking cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan's.</v>

1431
01:03:44.981 --> 01:03:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

1432
01:03:45.451 --> 01:03:47.790
<v Speaker 1>So if you wear Jordan's playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball,</v>

1433
01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:52.791
<v Speaker 1>like this guy is so fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's playing basketball and George or </v>

1434
01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:52.791
<v Speaker 1>even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1435
01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:56.931
<v Speaker 1>like he's playing basketball and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand dollar Retro Jordans that cost </v>

1436
01:03:56.931 --> 01:03:57.630
<v Speaker 1>a thousand dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them do.</v>

1437
01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1439
01:04:03.151 --> 01:04:05.370
<v Speaker 1>They're costing about 100 to 200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not 100,</v>

1440
01:04:05.371 --> 01:04:08.610
<v Speaker 1>200 bucks retail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the rarity of them,</v>

1441
01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.500
<v Speaker 1>especially depending on the year they </v>
<v Speaker 1>came out,</v>

1442
01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>if they came out five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1443
01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:14.760
<v Speaker 1>some of them cost a thousand bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 bucks.</v>

1444
01:04:14.761 --> 01:04:19.761
<v Speaker 1>Not to associate with geese or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get like a cheap g take out those </v>

1452
01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.590

<v Speaker 1>rolls to show you rose.</v>

1453
01:04:49.591 --> 01:04:54.060

1457
01:05:04.551 --> 01:05:09.551
<v Speaker 1>It's real durable too because the hemp </v>
<v Speaker 1>is just so much more durable than </v>

1458
01:05:09.551 --> 01:05:09.990
<v Speaker 1>cotton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just those things.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It usually takes a long time for one </v>

1461
01:05:16.101 --> 01:05:17.230
<v Speaker 1>starts to break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you have a single.</v>

1462
01:05:17.231 --> 01:05:17.800
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>The black one that you could pull them.</v>

1469
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:30.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm a gorilla in that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they.</v>

1470
01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:34.090
<v Speaker 2>I knew I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why I knew I wouldn't do well in</v>

1471
01:05:34.091 --> 01:05:35.360
<v Speaker 2>hot yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat guy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't respond well to.</v>

1474
01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:45.120
<v Speaker 2>When I first started Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the biggest problem I had that </v>

1475
01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.900
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know anything about geese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went and bought a Judogi.</v>

1476
01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:50.230
<v Speaker 2>That heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that heat level went all the way up.</v>

1477
01:05:50.231 --> 01:05:51.690
<v Speaker 2>That took me to a different place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1478
01:05:51.691 --> 01:05:54.760
<v Speaker 2>those double weave ds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like those things.</v>

1479
01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Those are very heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some people liked that.</v>

1480
01:05:58.190 --> 01:06:03.190
<v Speaker 2>They liked the double weave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like the feeling of security of </v>

1481
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.640
<v Speaker 2>having that very thick cloth around </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1482
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Some people like that golden weave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the single.</v>

1483
01:06:06.851 --> 01:06:10.250
<v Speaker 2>We've this summer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking thing.</v>

1484
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.750
<v Speaker 2>I want it to feel light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fucking get.</v>

1485
01:06:13.751 --> 01:06:15.600
<v Speaker 2>You don't look at the size of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I put again,</v>

1486
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:17.080
<v Speaker 2>it's 20 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also for me,</v>

1487
01:06:17.081 --> 01:06:17.810
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been.</v>

1488
01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:21.430
<v Speaker 2>How about staff a couple times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I always put a rash guard on anyway.</v>

1489
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Even if I were a rash guard on,</v>

<v Speaker 2>All that stuff is good for you.</v>

1505
01:07:17.441 --> 01:07:20.170

<v Speaker 2>Greek yogurt.</v>

1508
01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.270
<v Speaker 2>the Plain Greek yogurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1509
01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:30.040
<v Speaker 2>I like the Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like all the other ones.</v>

1510
01:07:30.041 --> 01:07:30.880
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1511
01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:34.720
<v Speaker 2>over the last few months I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>shying away from from dairy.</v>

1512
01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:39.960
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll eat a little cheese every now and </v>

1513
01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.941
<v Speaker 2>then because I like cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've been trying to eliminate dairy </v>

1514
01:07:41.941 --> 01:07:44.731
<v Speaker 2>from my diet a little bit just to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've heard from several people </v>

1515
01:07:44.731 --> 01:07:46.300
<v Speaker 2>that they've eliminated dairy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've had good reactions.</v>

1516
01:07:46.301 --> 01:07:51.301
<v Speaker 2>Their body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fed like less inflammation and it </v>

1517
01:07:51.301 --> 01:07:51.301
<v Speaker 2>makes them feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm that shit that sending that report.</v>

1518
01:07:51.301 --> 01:07:54.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm lactose intolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't drink milk.</v>

1519
01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000
<v Speaker 2>I drink a milkshake once a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll drink a milkshake and make a banana</v>

1520
01:08:00.041 --> 01:08:03.400
<v Speaker 2>shake at home or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My shakes then,</v>

1521
01:08:03.401 --> 01:08:06.970
<v Speaker 2>so I think that's what I'm going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>for November.</v>

1522
01:08:06.971 --> 01:08:08.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to figure out what I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do for November,</v>

1523
01:08:08.681 --> 01:08:13.681
<v Speaker 2>but I think for November I'm going to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire month without eating any </v>

1524
01:08:13.681 --> 01:08:14.470
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent the entire month.</v>

1525
01:08:14.471 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 2>Just all healthy food.</v>

1526
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.000
<v Speaker 5>No added sugar?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1527
01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.820
<v Speaker 5>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No Sodas,</v>

1528
01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:25.300
<v Speaker 5>no crap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to see what that feels </v>

1529
01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.881
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying we gotta we're going to </v>

1530
01:08:27.881 --> 01:08:28.100
<v Speaker 5>come up with some new challenge because </v>
<v Speaker 5>after this month doing this,</v>

1531
01:08:28.101 --> 01:08:30.260
<v Speaker 5>I feel like this was a very beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 5>month for me.</v>

1532
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:35.210
<v Speaker 5>Beneficial in that first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my back has never felt better.</v>

1533
01:08:35.290 --> 01:08:40.290
<v Speaker 5>Like doing yoga all these times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it makes your backfield </v>

1534
01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:43.661
<v Speaker 5>bulletproof.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you just feel like my posture and </v>

1535
01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:43.661
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like everything is just.</v>

1536
01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:48.790
<v Speaker 5>It feels so sturdy because yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially [inaudible] like that 90 </v>

1537
01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:53.501
<v Speaker 5>minute hot yoga shits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So much of it is about your back and </v>

1538
01:08:53.501 --> 01:08:53.870
<v Speaker 5>your core and like supporting your </v>
<v Speaker 5>spine.</v>

1539
01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:55.470
<v Speaker 5>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1540
01:08:55.490 --> 01:09:00.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sitting down a lot doing podcast even </v>

1541
01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:01.490
<v Speaker 5>though these chairs are phenomenal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these Pisco Ergo depot chairs,</v>

1542
01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.760
<v Speaker 5>these things are phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They keep you sitting in the right </v>

1543
01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:06.760
<v Speaker 5>posture and their support.</v>

1544
01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:11.200
<v Speaker 5>You well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's not real good to sit down all the </v>

1545
01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.141
<v Speaker 5>time like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of times your back is </v>

1546
01:09:14.141 --> 01:09:16.480
<v Speaker 5>compressed and if you don't have good </v>
<v Speaker 5>structure and if you don't have good </v>

1547
01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:20.591
<v Speaker 5>strength around the spine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like good muscle strength around the </v>

1548
01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:24.281
<v Speaker 5>spine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to develop all sorts of </v>

1549
01:09:24.281 --> 01:09:24.281
<v Speaker 5>weird problems and weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>weird issues with your back.</v>

1550
01:09:24.281 --> 01:09:29.111
<v Speaker 5>But I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've learned a lot and this month about </v>

1551
01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.610
<v Speaker 5>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what kind of exercises you need to do to</v>

1552
01:09:31.611 --> 01:09:34.010
<v Speaker 5>keep your back strong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1553
01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:37.970
<v Speaker 5>like this yoga shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like doing it as many times as we did it</v>

1554
01:09:37.971 --> 01:09:38.870
<v Speaker 5>this month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1555
01:09:38.871 --> 01:09:43.871
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to do it this many times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm definitely going to do it two </v>

1556
01:09:43.871 --> 01:09:43.871
<v Speaker 5>times a week from now on.</v>

1557
01:09:43.871 --> 01:09:46.120
<v Speaker 3>Definitely because if you mix it with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the weights,</v>

1558
01:09:46.121 --> 01:09:47.620
<v Speaker 3>a little run and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can go,</v>

1559
01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:48.880
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're good to go.</v>

1560
01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.600
<v Speaker 3>You don't need much if we're not going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the Olympics.</v>

1561
01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not fucking trying to maintain,</v>

1562
01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:58.840
<v Speaker 3>to maintain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep your fucking whatever going.</v>

1563
01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.490
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a lot.</v>

1564
01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:03.640
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever done the cryotherapy?</v>

<v Speaker 3>but it's right around the corner from my</v>

1567

<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think I had a lot of problems.</v>

<v Speaker 3>new lists.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They just talk.</v>

1605
01:11:44.970 --> 01:11:48.330
<v Speaker 3>That's all they do is talk with big </v>
<v Speaker 3>words to impress you.</v>

1606
01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:51.390
<v Speaker 3>But they don't say shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't say shit.</v>

1607
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:57.830
<v Speaker 3>Three or four big words to let you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're smart and then they didn't say </v>

1608
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:59.040
<v Speaker 3>nothing and it was a lot of repeating </v>
<v Speaker 3>narratives.</v>

1609
01:11:59.060 --> 01:11:59.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>recorders and I'm putting them on these </v>

<v Speaker 3>is 60 percent of America with these </v>

1614

<v Speaker 3>fucking people talking about this is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>idiots.</v>

1615

<v Speaker 3>The shit that comes out of that mouth is</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing and you sit there and go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

1617
01:12:23.791 --> 01:12:28.791
<v Speaker 3>Listen to these fucking dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen to what's coming out of their </v>

1618
01:12:28.791 --> 01:12:28.791
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women's rights.</v>

1619
01:12:28.791 --> 01:12:30.420
<v Speaker 3>That's what the total amount that the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1620
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:35.870
<v Speaker 3>what was their argument?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were saying that the guy that </v>

1621
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:38.970
<v Speaker 3>argument is everybody trying to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>smarter than everybody.</v>

1622
01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.890
<v Speaker 3>It's just six people trying out with </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

1623
01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:44.160
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you go to those dinner </v>
<v Speaker 3>parties you talk about,</v>

1624
01:12:44.730 --> 01:12:47.400
<v Speaker 3>and by the time they served the salad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to put a gun in your fucking.</v>

1625
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:50.400
<v Speaker 3>Why am I even fucking here with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

1626
01:12:50.401 --> 01:12:52.830
<v Speaker 3>I could have stopped at Burger King,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a better fucking time.</v>

1627
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:58.430
<v Speaker 3>That's why I don't go to those dinner </v>
<v Speaker 3>parties because it's eight people to </v>

1628
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.700
<v Speaker 3>once politics comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You loosely,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You lose me.</v>

1631
01:13:04.441 --> 01:13:06.630

<v Speaker 3>get a new one or shut the fuck up.</v>

1634
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.070
<v Speaker 3>I can't even put the news on it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's definitely 20 minutes on.</v>

1635
01:13:16.190 --> 01:13:18.190
<v Speaker 3>He didn't send the check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He called her.</v>

1636
01:13:19.050 --> 01:13:21.120
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just tell who gives a fuck.</v>

1637
01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:23.730
<v Speaker 3>Who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be something more.</v>

1638
01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.190
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be a seal stuck on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>beach somewhere.</v>

1639
01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:31.220
<v Speaker 3>This fucking country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something more important than this shit </v>

1640
01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:33.300
<v Speaker 3>every fucking day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the politics is over my world.</v>

1641
01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1642
01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:40.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to talk about </v>

1643
01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:40.340
<v Speaker 3>politics or religion that those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1644
01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:44.660
<v Speaker 3>but this new breed of gentile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just talk for the sense of talking </v>

1645
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:50.390
<v Speaker 3>to see who's the smartest person in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>room and at the end of the day they're </v>

1646
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:51.180
<v Speaker 3>all a bunch of dumb fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

1647
01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:55.860
<v Speaker 3>It was definitely a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking and just impress other people.</v>

1648
01:13:55.861 --> 01:13:56.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

1649
01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:01.820
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of people saying a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of things that they've read on </v>

1650
01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:04.611
<v Speaker 3>blogs or read on websites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wants to have an intelligent </v>

1651
01:14:05.161 --> 01:14:09.510
<v Speaker 3>conversation and everybody would he get </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck outta here.</v>

1652
01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.350
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck Outta here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1653
01:14:11.351 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 3>Leave me the fuck</v>

1654
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.630
<v Speaker 2>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand seven.</v>

1655
01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Would you rather them talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that makes sense?</v>

1656
01:14:21.681 --> 01:14:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Something simple that you're not trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to impress me.</v>

1657
01:14:24.341 --> 01:14:26.420
<v Speaker 2>Talk to me about your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you want.</v>

1658
01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:30.040
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot more than Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people are trying.</v>

1659
01:14:30.190 --> 01:14:35.190
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood is that people are always </v>

1660
01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:37.330
<v Speaker 2>trying out for auditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always going in on auditions and</v>

1661
01:14:37.331 --> 01:14:39.700
<v Speaker 2>they're always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always have to be picked and chosen</v>

1662
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:44.910
<v Speaker 2>and they're always trying to position </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves like someone that you would </v>

1663
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:47.950
<v Speaker 2>want to hire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they manufacture these,</v>

1664
01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.590
<v Speaker 2>these attitudes based on what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

1665
01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.900
<v Speaker 2>They lick their finger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hold it up,</v>

1666
01:14:52.901 --> 01:14:55.570
<v Speaker 2>they find out which way the wind's </v>
<v Speaker 2>blowing and that's the way they go.</v>

1667
01:14:55.810 --> 01:15:00.810
<v Speaker 2>And they start to sort of construct </v>
<v Speaker 2>their personality based on what they </v>

1668
01:15:00.881 --> 01:15:03.400
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the casting agents,</v>

1669
01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:05.590
<v Speaker 2>all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent of them are liberal.</v>

1670
01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:07.450
<v Speaker 2>They're all liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's liberal,</v>

1671
01:15:07.630 --> 01:15:12.630
<v Speaker 2>everyone across the board is a democrat </v>
<v Speaker 2>or of the radical ones are Bernie </v>

1672
01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Sanders supporters and everyone has very</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear left wing views,</v>

1673
01:15:16.811 --> 01:15:18.500
<v Speaker 2>whether you like it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not not,</v>

1674
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:23.550
<v Speaker 2>not a judgment on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these people that go in for </v>

1675
01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:27.361
<v Speaker 2>auditions and actors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is most of what you're running </v>

1676
01:15:27.361 --> 01:15:29.911
<v Speaker 2>into either actors or screenwriters or </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's trying to do something in </v>

1677
01:15:29.911 --> 01:15:33.871
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all want people to know that </v>

1678
01:15:33.871 --> 01:15:37.861
<v Speaker 2>they're on the right team and they all </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to say all the things that they </v>

1679
01:15:37.861 --> 01:15:42.391
<v Speaker 2>think need to be said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you solve a lot of the hypocrites </v>

1680
01:15:42.391 --> 01:15:43.720
<v Speaker 2>who was in the first few days of this </v>

<v Speaker 2>He was telling me how his mouth was cold</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's sucking dick or I didn't listen.</v>

1719
01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.350

<v Speaker 2>cubes in his mouth.</v>

01:17:17.530 --> 01:17:17.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

1723
01:17:17.530 --> 01:17:18.800

<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:20.180
<v Speaker 2>when he told me this story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was young.</v>

1725
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:22.200
<v Speaker 2>I had never heard that story before.</v>

<v Speaker 2>why don't I keep going know it's tough </v>

<v Speaker 2>However he took his dick out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Forty seven year old Canadian born </v>

<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1763
01:18:41.891 --> 01:18:46.060
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you hit like late forties and </v>

1764
01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:48.791
<v Speaker 2>you're one of those actresses and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped calling and your already crazy </v>

1765
01:18:48.791 --> 01:18:52.060
<v Speaker 2>and the pressure builds up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd cut off her own hair with a razor </v>

1766
01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:52.060
<v Speaker 2>blade and attempt to alter her </v>
<v Speaker 2>appearance.</v>

1767
01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:54.200
<v Speaker 2>A Glendale Police Sargent Rick Young </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bitch is crazy.</v>

1772
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:16.420

<v Speaker 2>Corey Feldman though?</v>

1773
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He apparently had arrest.</v>

1774
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing.</v>

1775
01:19:20.331 --> 01:19:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1776
01:19:20.991 --> 01:19:24.050
<v Speaker 2>I made a joke and people get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they got mad,</v>

1777
01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:26.210
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't them getting mad as me </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting mad at myself.</v>

1778
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:27.680
<v Speaker 2>What was the Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1779
01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:32.710
<v Speaker 2>he was wearing a really small jacket </v>
<v Speaker 2>while he's doing this performance at </v>

1780
01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:36.731
<v Speaker 2>like a minor league baseball game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was doing like this Michael </v>

1781
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Jackson thing and the jacket was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>small.</v>

1782
01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a jacket he was wearing when he </v>

1783
01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:43.900
<v Speaker 2>was getting diddled when he was a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid?</v>

1784
01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:44.900
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did I joke around that?</v>

1785
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:48.050
<v Speaker 2>It was just trying to make greg laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said something that I was.</v>

1786
01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:50.870
<v Speaker 2>And then afterwards when I saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially out of context,</v>

1787
01:19:50.871 --> 01:19:54.590
<v Speaker 2>I was very disappointed in myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants 10 million exposed.</v>

1788
01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:57.140
<v Speaker 2>He saw that he's out of his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1789
01:19:57.141 --> 01:19:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he,</v>

1790
01:19:59.150 --> 01:20:04.150
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never said that Michael Jackson did </v>

1791
01:20:04.150 --> 01:20:04.150
<v Speaker 2>anything to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1792
01:20:04.150 --> 01:20:07.360
<v Speaker 2>he said Michael Jackson didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he said that there's a lot of </v>

1793
01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:07.650
<v Speaker 2>pedophilia in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to make some sort of a movie on</v>

1794
01:20:07.651 --> 01:20:07.740
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1795
01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:11.220
<v Speaker 5>which I'm sure there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>pedophilia in Hollywood,</v>

1796
01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:13.980
<v Speaker 5>but like this idea that people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to kill him.</v>

1797
01:20:13.981 --> 01:20:16.410
<v Speaker 5>You were saying people trying to run </v>
<v Speaker 5>them over and someone.</v>

1798
01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:21.500
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that what we're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I watched the video for the hearts and </v>

1799
01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:21.890
<v Speaker 5>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt bad for my kids.</v>

1800
01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:24.450
<v Speaker 5>If they wanted to kill him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'd be dead.</v>

1801
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:27.480
<v Speaker 5>Yet he tried to hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not real.</v>

1802
01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:29.910
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like weird paranoid as shit.</v>

1803
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.160
<v Speaker 5>Let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they want to kill you,</v>

1804
01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:36.210
<v Speaker 5>you're dead and it's not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>trucks trying to run you over.</v>

1805
01:20:36.211 --> 01:20:41.211
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be a guy out of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shoots you in the head and gets in his </v>

1806
01:20:41.211 --> 01:20:43.770
<v Speaker 5>car and no one's going to know who he is</v>
<v Speaker 5>and no one's going to catch them because</v>

1807
01:20:43.771 --> 01:20:47.060
<v Speaker 5>they're going to hire a professional.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this idea that someone's gonna like</v>

1808
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:50.460
<v Speaker 5>miss him with a car and then they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>chasing them or running them down.</v>

1809
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:53.010
<v Speaker 5>I find that very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's possible,</v>

1810
01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:56.610
<v Speaker 5>but I find it very hard to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always think that like if someone is a</v>

1811
01:20:56.611 --> 01:20:57.780
<v Speaker 5>very powerful man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1812
01:20:58.570 --> 01:21:01.230
<v Speaker 5>like I don't know if the Clintons ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>whacked anybody,</v>

1813
01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.720
<v Speaker 5>but if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they whack those fucking people.</v>

1814
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:05.670
<v Speaker 5>Like that one guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the big,</v>

1815
01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:10.170
<v Speaker 5>the big conspiracy theory about the guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>who released all this stuff.</v>

1816
01:21:10.171 --> 01:21:12.840
<v Speaker 5>To wiki leaks of the DNC guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seth rich.</v>

1817
01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:15.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They killed that motherfucker.</v>

1818
01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:20.360
<v Speaker 5>Whoever did it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether he was killed because some </v>

1819
01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.821
<v Speaker 5>random person decided to shoot him in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the back in the middle of the night and </v>

1820
01:21:22.821 --> 01:21:24.030
<v Speaker 5>not steal his watch or his phone or his </v>
<v Speaker 5>wallet,</v>

1821
01:21:24.150 --> 01:21:28.680
<v Speaker 5>whether it's that or whether it's what </v>
<v Speaker 5>Julian assange's from Wiki leaks said is</v>

1822
01:21:28.681 --> 01:21:33.681
<v Speaker 5>that there's consequences to leaking </v>
<v Speaker 5>information to wikileaks because that's </v>

1823
01:21:33.681 --> 01:21:33.681
<v Speaker 5>what they were saying and people were </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>

1824
01:21:33.681 --> 01:21:38.361
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is another one of the Clinton body </v>

1825
01:21:38.361 --> 01:21:39.951
<v Speaker 5>count people and then this giant </v>
<v Speaker 5>conspiracy theories about how many </v>

1826
01:21:39.951 --> 01:21:39.951
<v Speaker 5>people the Clinton's have had killed.</v>

1827
01:21:39.951 --> 01:21:42.660
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's true or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have zero information,</v>

1828
01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:45.720
<v Speaker 5>but I do know when people want you dead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're dead.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We're drinking or drinking wine while </v>

2008
01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:02.580
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with no body or abused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He don't do Dick.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He walks around looking dirty.</v>

2010
01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:11.720
<v Speaker 2>When you see them in the daytime and </v>

<v Speaker 2>How's that even possible?</v>

2018
01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.100

2120
01:35:08.171 --> 01:35:09.770
<v Speaker 2>consequences of jamming 20 million </v>

2130
01:35:39.401 --> 01:35:39.530
<v Speaker 2>it deserved because there was so much </v>

01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Smashing waves against the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>building or the side of the road rather.</v>

2171
01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>

2172
01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:37.940
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty bad car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How cool is that?</v>

2173
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.790
<v Speaker 2>They take those cards and they put like </v>
<v Speaker 2>four cylinder diesels in them too.</v>

2174
01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:43.400
<v Speaker 2>They do all kinds of crazy shit with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shannon.</v>

2175
01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Did you watch that show when they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

2176
01:37:45.381 --> 01:37:49.770
<v Speaker 2>The 13 episodes of the Cuban cause now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen a lot of things on.</v>

2177
01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Are they interesting how they fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>paint them and all that shit that they </v>

2178
01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:57.810
<v Speaker 2>get like tar and put the car together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty interesting shit.</v>

2179
01:37:58.470 --> 01:38:01.200
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy who bought an island,</v>

2180
01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:03.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of,</v>

2181
01:38:03.181 --> 01:38:04.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuba.</v>

2182
01:38:04.650 --> 01:38:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I forget what island it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it it got hit so bad by the </v>

2183
01:38:09.650 --> 01:38:11.670
<v Speaker 2>hurricane that it completely wiped off </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything on the island.</v>

2184
01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:13.500
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some billionaire character,</v>

2185
01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:17.220
<v Speaker 2>bought the entire island and for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first time in over 300 years,</v>

2186
01:38:17.221 --> 01:38:22.221
<v Speaker 2>it's unpopulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's literally no one living on this </v>

2187
01:38:22.221 --> 01:38:22.221
<v Speaker 2>island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It went from being this green,</v>

2188
01:38:22.221 --> 01:38:26.961
<v Speaker 2>lush Ireland to be in just a big flat </v>
<v Speaker 2>patch of dirt like flattened.</v>

2189
01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:31.840
<v Speaker 2>It just got hit by the full brunt of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>storm right after this dude bought it.</v>

2190
01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:37.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much you spent on it </v>

2191
01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:37.460
<v Speaker 2>except Richard Branson's island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

2192
01:38:37.470 --> 01:38:38.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2193
01:38:38.701 --> 01:38:42.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the guy who owns a John </v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Mitchell.</v>

2194
01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Nectar island completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2195
01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:51.300
<v Speaker 2>nobody noticed using ad blocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sir Richard Branson says nectar island </v>

2196
01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:52.500
<v Speaker 2>completely and utterly devastated by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hurricane Irma.</v>

2197
01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:53.940
<v Speaker 2>Irma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2198
01:38:53.941 --> 01:38:56.940
<v Speaker 2>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that island got jack two,</v>

2199
01:38:57.210 --> 01:39:02.210
<v Speaker 2>but there was an island that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely unpopulated for the first </v>

2200
01:39:02.210 --> 01:39:03.450
<v Speaker 2>time in 300 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the island was,</v>

2201
01:39:03.451 --> 01:39:08.451
<v Speaker 2>but these are just going to get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the crazy thing about these </v>

2202
01:39:08.451 --> 01:39:11.340
<v Speaker 2>hurricanes is they're building up steam </v>
<v Speaker 2>out in the ocean versus in the Gulf,</v>

2203
01:39:11.490 --> 01:39:15.270
<v Speaker 2>like usually they would get to the Gulf </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would build up because the Gulf</v>

2204
01:39:15.271 --> 01:39:20.271
<v Speaker 2>has warmer water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the water and the ocean is getting </v>

2205
01:39:20.271 --> 01:39:21.690
<v Speaker 2>so warm that the island of Barbuda I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think.</v>

2206
01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

2207
01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:24.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't think somebody owns that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2208
01:39:24.210 --> 01:39:25.470
<v Speaker 2>someone just bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

2209
01:39:25.471 --> 01:39:26.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2210
01:39:26.701 --> 01:39:29.250
<v Speaker 2>Some guy just bought the island of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Barbuda Amish.</v>

2211
01:39:29.251 --> 01:39:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Something to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you be thinking about labor?</v>

2212
01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I think about leaving all the time.</v>

2213
01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:37.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What been discussing?</v>

2214
01:39:37.530 --> 01:39:39.960
<v Speaker 2>You open it up when it was getting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>100,</v>

2215
01:39:39.961 --> 01:39:42.720
<v Speaker 2>nine degrees in fucking October.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>

2216
01:39:42.890 --> 01:39:44.820
<v Speaker 2>what is this going to be like in five </v>
<v Speaker 2>years?</v>

2217
01:39:45.230 --> 01:39:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Like is this keep going to keep getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse?</v>

2218
01:39:47.490 --> 01:39:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Like if climate change is real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be.</v>

2219
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.010
<v Speaker 2>If we're getting record temperatures </v>
<v Speaker 2>every year,</v>

2220
01:39:53.011 --> 01:39:55.050
<v Speaker 2>which seems to be happening at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>around here.</v>

2221
01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:58.410
<v Speaker 2>You gotta wonder like when that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable anymore.</v>

2222
01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:00.870
<v Speaker 2>When you do you want to live in Phoenix </v>
<v Speaker 2>in August?</v>

2223
01:40:00.871 --> 01:40:04.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't you know that that Phoenix </v>
<v Speaker 2>weather we've been there before,</v>

2224
01:40:04.710 --> 01:40:06.870
<v Speaker 2>120 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>

2225
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:12.510
<v Speaker 2>that's not dealable to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that Robert Deniro vows to </v>

2226
01:40:14.971 --> 01:40:17.430
<v Speaker 2>rebuild the island of Barbuda after </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hurricane Irma strikes.</v>

2227
01:40:17.431 --> 01:40:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Why is it filled with black checks now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He owns a year before.</v>

2228
01:40:20.431 --> 01:40:24.890
<v Speaker 2>I guess he bought a resort there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's taking it all.</v>

2229

2234
01:40:32.690 --> 01:40:35.040
<v Speaker 2>They did the tribute to Robert Deniro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2235

<v Speaker 2>I'm beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say got it there with a fucking </v>

<v Speaker 2>Can't be mad at him for that.</v>

2241

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't for me,</v>

2327
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:30.560
<v Speaker 2>but that was on a couple of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That same with the bikers.</v>

2328
01:44:31.610 --> 01:44:33.740
<v Speaker 2>That's a great fucking scene and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a true story.</v>

2329
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:37.400
<v Speaker 2>That's a true fucking store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This old school,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he came back and told them to be cool.</v>

2332
01:44:43.311 --> 01:44:46.040
<v Speaker 2>No clock the door and said no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't leave.</v>

2333
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:47.570

01:44:47.570 --> 01:44:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Ever seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just beat the fuck out of all those</v>

2335
01:44:50.181 --> 01:44:55.181
<v Speaker 2>bikers and they get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that movie was about the kid that </v>

2336
01:44:55.181 --> 01:44:57.590
<v Speaker 2>was on the sopranos that ended up going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to prison for murder.</v>

2337
01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just cultural.</v>

2338
01:45:00.850 --> 01:45:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>His name was marsh,</v>

2341
01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.670
<v Speaker 2>so they put them in the closet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't even,</v>

2342
01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:10.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't want his money touching my </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

2343
01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:13.600
<v Speaker 2>so bad luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that whole thing is about him,</v>

2344
01:45:13.601 --> 01:45:14.600
<v Speaker 2>the date and the black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jake.</v>

2345
01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:20.410
<v Speaker 2>And then they go to the member,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that that street in the Bronx where </v>

2346
01:45:20.841 --> 01:45:24.050
<v Speaker 2>I used to get nickel bags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever avenue off that,</v>

2347
01:45:24.051 --> 01:45:29.051
<v Speaker 2>all that shit up there so it adds in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>black neighborhood so he would have to </v>

2348
01:45:29.051 --> 01:45:33.101
<v Speaker 2>walk home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when on the walk home is for </v>

2349
01:45:33.101 --> 01:45:36.251
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went into the black neighborhood with </v>

2350
01:45:36.251 --> 01:45:36.900
<v Speaker 2>the car and they got blown up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got to watch this movie again.</v>

2351
01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:41.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a good movie man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That chazz Palminteri guy.</v>

2352
01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:43.580
<v Speaker 2>He did a lot of shit and then he kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>vanished.</v>

2353
01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Like he's still around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing this shit and Broadway now.</v>

2354
01:45:49.130 --> 01:45:51.620
<v Speaker 2>What's he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Bronx Tale on Broadway.</v>

2355
01:45:51.621 --> 01:45:55.280
<v Speaker 2>He just took it out to say he took it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out into new musical.</v>

2356
01:45:57.570 --> 01:46:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Get even with the gay community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at their narrow.</v>

2357
01:46:00.051 --> 01:46:05.051

<v Speaker 2>That's the gay guy who tell a bronx </v>

2358

<v Speaker 2>tale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2359
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:09.290
<v Speaker 2>This is a good movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bizarre,</v>

2360
01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:13.940
<v Speaker 2>bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember this guy lived at your boys and</v>

2361
01:46:13.941 --> 01:46:16.460
<v Speaker 2>they used to go home at night and tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories every night.</v>

2362
01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:22.120
<v Speaker 2>So those guys are pissed because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>said supposedly took some of their </v>

2363
01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:22.120
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankie Renzulli,</v>

2364
01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:27.880
<v Speaker 2>most of his stories from East Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually wound up in this movie,</v>

2365
01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:29.760
<v Speaker 2>so he did a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2366
01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:32.360
<v Speaker 2>they kinda have residual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the kind of the Sopranos.</v>

2367
01:46:32.361 --> 01:46:37.361
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he realized he's written for a lot </v>

2368
01:46:37.361 --> 01:46:37.550
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2369
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:41.630
<v Speaker 2>But that world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that world of guineas and mob movies and</v>

2370
01:46:41.631 --> 01:46:43.010
<v Speaker 2>mob stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

2371
01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:48.100
<v Speaker 2>it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like an identity and a weird </v>

2372
01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:51.971
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like an identity that they put </v>

2373
01:46:51.971 --> 01:46:52.500
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2374
01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:55.740
<v Speaker 2>the connected Italian character </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>

2375
01:46:55.950 --> 01:47:00.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like from the soprano's on that </v>

2376
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:01.110
<v Speaker 2>became a big selling point in Hollywood.</v>

2377
01:47:01.110 --> 01:47:04.190
<v Speaker 2>Like it was a niche that people got </v>
<v Speaker 2>excited about.</v>

2378
01:47:04.191 --> 01:47:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Like the Italian gangster movie became a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big thing.</v>

2379
01:47:06.721 --> 01:47:11.721
<v Speaker 2>The Italian gangster films became a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and so there was like a whole </v>

2380
01:47:11.721 --> 01:47:13.650
<v Speaker 2>bunch of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm sure you went out for auditions</v>

2381
01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:16.710
<v Speaker 2>and you around those guys that were in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that loop.</v>

2382
01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:20.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a dumb little dumb loop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>

2383
01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:21.910
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2384
01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:26.920
<v Speaker 2>well they were talking about less but </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the sopranos killed a Mafia TV </v>

2385
01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:27.330
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2386
01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:31.080
<v Speaker 2>You won't see the movie again for 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years because there were so good.</v>

2387
01:47:31.410 --> 01:47:32.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just covered too many of the bait.</v>

2388
01:47:32.970 --> 01:47:37.970
<v Speaker 2>You've never seen it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every once in awhile I got the script </v>

2389
01:47:37.970 --> 01:47:37.970
<v Speaker 2>for a mob where they want you to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>refill this.</v>

2390
01:47:37.970 --> 01:47:42.060
<v Speaker 2>I opened it up and if I see Gino baby or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony or Angelo,</v>

2391
01:47:42.090 --> 01:47:46.710
<v Speaker 2>I closed a script because you're living </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a fucking fools paradise.</v>

2392
01:47:46.710 --> 01:47:49.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to get made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not going to do nothing.</v>

2393
01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:54.260
<v Speaker 2>You got to come and that's why they </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't been able to figure out the </v>

2394
01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:54.420
<v Speaker 2>posts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The prattle world.</v>

2395
01:47:54.630 --> 01:47:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was too much.</v>

2396
01:47:56.131 --> 01:48:00.420
<v Speaker 2>They got into the Columbus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They even got into Columbus Day.</v>

2397
01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:05.660
<v Speaker 2>That's how brilliant a fucking sopranos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they did an episode about Columbus </v>

2398
01:48:06.181 --> 01:48:09.830
<v Speaker 2>Day when they sent people down there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick Depalo played the cop and.</v>

2399
01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:11.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember,</v>

2400
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:14.250
<v Speaker 2>remember that soprano started off as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy?</v>

2401
01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2402
01:48:15.571 --> 01:48:20.571
<v Speaker 2>Sopranos started off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first episode was over the top </v>

2403
01:48:20.571 --> 01:48:21.120
<v Speaker 2>comedy where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's her name?</v>

2404
01:48:21.121 --> 01:48:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Ed Falco was outside with an AK 47 </v>
<v Speaker 2>because her daughter was trying to sneak</v>

2405
01:48:24.631 --> 01:48:27.990
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she was a cartoon character.</v>

2406
01:48:28.230 --> 01:48:29.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was ridiculous,</v>

2407
01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:34.970
<v Speaker 2>and then slowly but surely it became </v>
<v Speaker 2>this really intense,</v>

2408
01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:37.950
<v Speaker 2>complicated drama and it wasn't funny at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

2409
01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mother died.</v>

2410
01:48:40.370 --> 01:48:42.870
<v Speaker 2>That changed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the first show that somebody died</v>

2411
01:48:42.871 --> 01:48:46.110
<v Speaker 2>and changed the course of it because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would've been completely different.</v>

2412
01:48:46.111 --> 01:48:47.910
<v Speaker 2>It would have ended with her being the </v>
<v Speaker 2>boss.</v>

2413
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would've been the first time her,</v>

2414
01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:54.120
<v Speaker 2>but they went back to this last night </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Godfather,</v>

2415
01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:57.360
<v Speaker 2>how they had failed twice to make a mob </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

2416
01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Kirk Douglas had done a movie in </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 67.</v>

2417
01:49:00.730 --> 01:49:02.460
<v Speaker 2>It didn't do well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with this,</v>

2418
01:49:02.461 --> 01:49:05.460
<v Speaker 2>Mario Puzo was fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The book was tremendous.</v>

2419
01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:07.980
<v Speaker 2>They sent it to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his name?</v>

2420
01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:11.520
<v Speaker 2>They did not want Marlon Brando.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2421
01:49:11.550 --> 01:49:12.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did not.</v>

2422
01:49:12.781 --> 01:49:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Marlon Brando had been a dud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had just done fucking a.</v>

2423
01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:19.830
<v Speaker 2>That movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that movie where he bought the island.</v>

2424
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>island of Dr Moreau.</v>

2425
01:49:21.670 --> 01:49:22.710
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2426
01:49:22.711 --> 01:49:23.820
<v Speaker 2>The one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big one.</v>

2427
01:49:23.821 --> 01:49:28.310
<v Speaker 2>When he first bought the island in 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>68 or so when he bought his own eyes,</v>

2428
01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:31.980
<v Speaker 2>but he shot the movie a bounty with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>treasure.</v>

2429
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:34.470
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the name of the movie is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One Christo.</v>

2430
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Somehow they gave a bunch of money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>go down there and shoot the movie.</v>

2431
01:49:37.201 --> 01:49:38.580
<v Speaker 2>He found love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the natives.</v>

2432
01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:41.670
<v Speaker 2>So he got like the first guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey jamie,</v>

2433
01:49:41.671 --> 01:49:45.230

<v Speaker 2>And he started fucking raining everyday.</v>

2434
01:49:45.690 --> 01:49:46.950
<v Speaker 2>So paramount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the,</v>

2435
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.380
<v Speaker 2>I saw the footage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they saw birds and people running.</v>

2436
01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:52.530

<v Speaker 2>what happened to our moving?</v>

<v Speaker 2>off from directing it mountain.</v>

2438
01:49:57.910 --> 01:50:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Beautifully mutiny on the bounty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was done.</v>

2439
01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:06.660
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he came back from the states like </v>

2440
01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:07.690

<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to talk to him no more.</v>

2441
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:11.320
<v Speaker 2>You fucked on money.</v>

01:50:13.451 --> 01:50:15.010
<v Speaker 2>he told his wife to go fuck yourself.</v>

2446
01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Go fuck themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just started hanging out.</v>

2525
01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:55.880
<v Speaker 3>the studio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was too long,</v>

2526
01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:57.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't quote me on that.</v>

2527
01:53:57.441 --> 01:53:58.880
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the studio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the director,</v>

2528
01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:02.570
<v Speaker 3>but James Caan scenes or just not to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

2529
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:05.630
<v Speaker 3>You can see he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Michael was fucking tough.</v>

2530
01:54:06.090 --> 01:54:08.210
<v Speaker 3>Michael slots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those dudes.</v>

2531
01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:12.980
<v Speaker 3>That's when directing was directing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've ever done anything bad in your</v>

2532
01:54:12.981 --> 01:54:14.720
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything bad.</v>

2533
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:17.290
<v Speaker 3>When you do something bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know he is ranked.</v>

2534
01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:21.230
<v Speaker 3>Your ears ring or when your adrenaline </v>
<v Speaker 3>is off the charts.</v>

2535
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:26.830
<v Speaker 3>When you're hiding in a bush and </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody is coming towards you and you </v>

2536
01:54:26.830 --> 01:54:28.940
<v Speaker 3>got to hit them with that stick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have no idea what happens to you.</v>

2537
01:54:30.170 --> 01:54:31.640
<v Speaker 3>You have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan.</v>

2538
01:54:32.180 --> 01:54:34.490
<v Speaker 3>That's why I've always loved the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Godfather,</v>

2539
01:54:34.491 --> 01:54:37.850
<v Speaker 3>all those types of movies because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>he comes out of the bathroom,</v>

2540
01:54:37.851 --> 01:54:41.840
<v Speaker 3>you hear the train screeching key,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2541
01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:44.070
<v Speaker 3>But that's what you hear when your </v>

<v Speaker 3>in the head with a stick.</v>

2544
01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:54.280
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nevermind having to come out of a </v>

<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

<v Speaker 3>heart beats that adrenaline's going?</v>

<v Speaker 3>You don't hear nothing.</v>

2549
01:55:01.730 --> 01:55:04.130
<v Speaker 3>Like when I used to rob houses or rob </v>
<v Speaker 3>drug dealers,</v>

2552
01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:14.000
<v Speaker 3>You know I had this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot about this.</v>

2553
01:55:14.001 --> 01:55:17.780
<v Speaker 3>I had this when I was 19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was an electrician and Aspen,</v>

2554
01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:21.230
<v Speaker 3>there was a dude that used to break my </v>
<v Speaker 3>balls all the time,</v>

2555
01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:23.690
<v Speaker 3>like say stupid things for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would always go,</v>

2556
01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:25.190
<v Speaker 3>there's two things about you I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

2557
01:55:25.191 --> 01:55:26.810
<v Speaker 3>You're Cuban and you're from the east </v>
<v Speaker 3>coast.</v>

2558
01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:33.040
<v Speaker 3>So I always knew me and this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have a little fucking </v>

2559
01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:33.040
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 19.</v>

2560
01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:34.230
<v Speaker 3>He was a little older than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always knew man,</v>

2561
01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:37.280
<v Speaker 3>this motherfucker when I have a problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he'd always say little things to me,</v>

2562
01:55:37.281 --> 01:55:40.640
<v Speaker 3>go get my tools out of the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I always tell them,</v>

2563
01:55:40.641 --> 01:55:41.690
<v Speaker 3>go get them yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pitch.</v>

2564
01:55:41.691 --> 01:55:43.950
<v Speaker 3>And I was Kinda scared of that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I knew me and him,</v>

2565
01:55:43.951 --> 01:55:48.951
<v Speaker 3>we're going to battle one day and one </v>
<v Speaker 3>day he said something and I told him to </v>

2566
01:55:48.951 --> 01:55:48.951
<v Speaker 3>go fuck himself.</v>

2567
01:55:48.951 --> 01:55:51.480
<v Speaker 3>And when I came back from lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put a box cutter to my throat.</v>

2568
01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:53.610
<v Speaker 3>He got me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I was coming in,</v>

2569
01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:55.860
<v Speaker 3>he threw me against the wall and you had</v>
<v Speaker 3>the box cutter on me.</v>

2570
01:55:55.861 --> 01:55:58.980
<v Speaker 3>I was bigger than him physically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I knew I could fuck them up.</v>

2571
01:55:58.981 --> 01:56:00.530
<v Speaker 3>I was just scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a young kid.</v>

2572
01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:02.370
<v Speaker 3>I was not in my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was living in basalt,</v>

2573
01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2574
01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:08.960
<v Speaker 3>I was not on my turf with my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But after he put that knife to my </v>

2575
01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:09.630
<v Speaker 3>throat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget that.</v>

2576
01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:12.420
<v Speaker 3>I fucking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he stepped away,</v>

2577
01:56:12.421 --> 01:56:15.960
<v Speaker 3>that thing came into my mind where if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you pull your gun out,</v>

2578
01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:18.820
<v Speaker 3>you was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing came out that.</v>

2579
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:20.940
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fucking kill this guy.</v>

2580
01:56:21.150 --> 01:56:22.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do something bad for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

2581
01:56:23.970 --> 01:56:26.610
<v Speaker 3>And I had a guy who used to shoot with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that taught me how to shoot guns.</v>

2582
01:56:26.611 --> 01:56:31.611
<v Speaker 3>He was a Vietnam vet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on the weekends I would give him </v>

2583
01:56:31.611 --> 01:56:34.671
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He teach me how to shoot everything a </v>

2584
01:56:34.671 --> 01:56:34.671
<v Speaker 3>and fucking ak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told he had every weapon.</v>

2585
01:56:34.671 --> 01:56:36.510
<v Speaker 3>He was just a Vietnam vet that lived in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Aspen.</v>

2586
01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:41.780
<v Speaker 3>And I finally figured out why they put </v>
<v Speaker 3>all those Vietnam vets around Aspen in </v>

2587
01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:43.050
<v Speaker 3>Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why Norad?</v>

2588
01:56:45.330 --> 01:56:47.250
<v Speaker 3>Norad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they can be ready to fucking rock.</v>

2589
01:56:47.251 --> 01:56:49.120
<v Speaker 3>I never thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2590
01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:51.720
<v Speaker 3>everybody thinks that if we get hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to hit California,</v>

2591
01:56:51.770 --> 01:56:56.770
<v Speaker 3>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most strategic place that would be </v>

2592
01:56:56.770 --> 01:56:59.090
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they control everything out of </v>

2593
01:56:59.090 --> 01:57:00.510
<v Speaker 3>Colorado and under that fucking mountain</v>
<v Speaker 3>really lets you read up about it.</v>

2594
01:57:00.511 --> 01:57:02.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know shit about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2595
01:57:02.071 --> 01:57:07.071
<v Speaker 3>Like that was years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They always said we will get hit we to </v>

2596
01:57:07.071 --> 01:57:07.071
<v Speaker 3>hit Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happened with you and the guy in</v>

2597
01:57:07.071 --> 01:57:10.950
<v Speaker 3>the box in the guy in the box cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kept fucking like I was scared of this</v>

2598
01:57:10.951 --> 01:57:11.640
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan.</v>

2599
01:57:11.641 --> 01:57:16.641
<v Speaker 3>I was definitely scared of this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at that time I wanted to kill my </v>

2600
01:57:16.641 --> 01:57:17.160
<v Speaker 3>stepfather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went to my friend,</v>

2601
01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:18.990
<v Speaker 3>the guy who was teaching me how to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>

2602
01:57:18.991 --> 01:57:20.340
<v Speaker 3>And I told him about what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2603
01:57:20.341 --> 01:57:25.341
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're thinking they're shooting his </v>

2604
01:57:25.341 --> 01:57:25.341
<v Speaker 3>step,</v>
<v Speaker 3>father,</v>

2605
01:57:25.341 --> 01:57:26.690
<v Speaker 3>why don't you use this guy's practice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2606
01:57:26.730 --> 01:57:31.730
<v Speaker 3>what's the difference if you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back to New Jersey and struck your </v>

2607
01:57:31.730 --> 01:57:32.520
<v Speaker 3>stepfather and shoot them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>start with this guy.</v>

2608
01:57:32.690 --> 01:57:34.830
<v Speaker 3>Use them is fucking practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2609
01:57:36.270 --> 01:57:37.680
<v Speaker 3>I was a little pushy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought about it,</v>

2610
01:57:37.681 --> 01:57:39.510
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy pulled a knife to my throat.</v>

2611
01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:44.720
<v Speaker 3>I fucking didn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan at all said I'm going to get </v>

2612
01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:44.720
<v Speaker 3>this guy.</v>

2613
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:47.700
<v Speaker 3>So I was cool to him at work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I let him go to work.</v>

2614
01:57:48.090 --> 01:57:53.090
<v Speaker 3>This went on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I figured like get them over the </v>

2615
01:57:53.090 --> 01:57:53.090
<v Speaker 3>holidays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a boozer and he went through this</v>

2616
01:57:53.090 --> 01:57:56.670
<v Speaker 3>little bar and carbondale all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I figured my get him down there.</v>

2617
01:57:56.671 --> 01:57:59.610
<v Speaker 3>So I went to Fred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go teach me everything I need to do to</v>

2618
01:57:59.611 --> 01:58:00.840
<v Speaker 3>get this guy down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

2619
01:58:00.841 --> 01:58:02.910
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get you in and out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>there as quick as possible.</v>

2620
01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:05.400
<v Speaker 3>And he's the first guy that ever taught </v>
<v Speaker 3>me a hanger.</v>

2621
01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:08.640
<v Speaker 3>You whip somebody with a fucking hanger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all low.</v>

2622
01:58:08.670 --> 01:58:09.750
<v Speaker 3>You take the hanger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whip it,</v>

2623
01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:13.020
<v Speaker 3>taped the other side and just come out </v>

<v Speaker 3>in the legs a few times and then I close</v>

2658
01:59:47.201 --> 01:59:47.680
<v Speaker 3>to him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>time for the University of Colorado.</v>

2737
02:03:39.740 --> 02:03:44.740
<v Speaker 3>From that from like 1989 to 93 that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of problems in Colorado that were </v>

2738
02:03:45.801 --> 02:03:47.480
<v Speaker 3>getting caught criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what it was,</v>

2739
02:03:47.481 --> 02:03:49.970
<v Speaker 3>it was just three black guys walking </v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

2740
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:52.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Boulder at 11:00</v>

2741
02:03:52.251 --> 02:03:53.510
<v Speaker 3>at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cops pull over.</v>

2742
02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:56.090
<v Speaker 3>One of them says racism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get into a fight.</v>

2743
02:03:56.630 --> 02:03:57.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get me wrong,</v>

2744
02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:00.500
<v Speaker 3>nobody was angels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fucking one linebacker the heck and</v>

2745
02:04:00.570 --> 02:04:03.590
<v Speaker 3>Davidson Mcgee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody called him a yom one time.</v>

2746
02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:07.470
<v Speaker 3>He punched him in the face so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He broke the guy's eye socket.</v>

2747
02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:11.660
<v Speaker 3>That guy ended up going to the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>New York giants as a linebacker.</v>

2748
02:04:12.710 --> 02:04:16.400
<v Speaker 3>But that's how bad that problem with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>college football players.</v>

2749
02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:21.460
<v Speaker 3>It was that bad in boulder at one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I went to court and the guy </v>

2750
02:04:21.591 --> 02:04:22.820
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no charges here.</v>

2751
02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Even the cops wouldn't charge me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wrote me a summons to go to court,</v>

2752
02:04:27.170 --> 02:04:29.630
<v Speaker 3>but they wouldn't charge me for smacking</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking dude.</v>

2753
02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:32.300
<v Speaker 3>Then right after that I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

2754
02:04:32.301 --> 02:04:34.120
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I stay here,</v>

2755
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:36.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's number one.</v>

2756
02:04:36.741 --> 02:04:38.460
<v Speaker 3>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really wanted to do comedy.</v>

2757
02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:41.550
<v Speaker 3>I really wanted to give.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comedy is shot,</v>

2758
02:04:41.670 --> 02:04:42.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2759
02:04:42.421 --> 02:04:44.790
<v Speaker 3>I gotta give it a shot here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old were you?</v>

2760
02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:48.450
<v Speaker 3>Thirty two years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got on stage the first time.</v>

2761
02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:51.000
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 91.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how long has that?</v>

2762
02:04:51.001 --> 02:04:53.070
<v Speaker 3>Twenty six years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2763
02:04:53.130 --> 02:04:54.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>26 years.</v>

2764
02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:58.170
<v Speaker 3>So the first time I dicked around for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first two years,</v>

2765
02:04:58.171 --> 02:04:59.580
<v Speaker 3>but light by 93.</v>

2766
02:04:59.970 --> 02:05:03.990
<v Speaker 3>I got really serious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I went back to be a dad,</v>

2767
02:05:03.991 --> 02:05:06.300
<v Speaker 3>I was really serious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a good job,</v>

2768
02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:11.900
<v Speaker 3>but they kept fucking with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that one day when he called me a </v>

2769
02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:11.900
<v Speaker 3>spic and I smacked him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that changed everything.</v>

2770
02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:13.830
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's never going to be the same.</v>

2771
02:05:13.831 --> 02:05:16.110
<v Speaker 3>I saw my little girl crying and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2772
02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:21.500
<v Speaker 3>she's a grown up in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in that world where people </v>

2773
02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:21.500
<v Speaker 3>getting smacked and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2774
02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:24.900
<v Speaker 3>she didn't grow up in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I just said,</v>

2775
02:05:24.901 --> 02:05:26.880
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to win this fucking war.</v>

2776
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:32.510
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be a war that I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to either end up in jail or something </v>

2777
02:05:32.510 --> 02:05:33.130
<v Speaker 3>good and I'm going to kill one of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucks.</v>

2778
02:05:33.710 --> 02:05:38.040
<v Speaker 3>I might as well give company a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did I have to lose?</v>

2779
02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:42.570
<v Speaker 3>It's this crazy thing that that was your</v>
<v Speaker 3>option and then think about all the shit</v>

2780
02:05:42.571 --> 02:05:46.860
<v Speaker 3>that you've been through now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like thinking of yourself back then.</v>

2781
02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:49.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you think about today,</v>

2782
02:05:49.831 --> 02:05:53.310
<v Speaker 3>like your life with your little daughter</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your wife and you know,</v>

2783
02:05:53.670 --> 02:05:58.670
<v Speaker 3>doing podcasts and doing all these shows</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere and then just thinking like </v>

2784
02:05:58.670 --> 02:05:59.960
<v Speaker 3>holding someone hostage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kidnapping them,</v>

2785
02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:04.110
<v Speaker 3>robin a drug deal with the machine gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just think that was you.</v>

2786
02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:06.810
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird because that's not you.</v>

2787
02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:08.390
<v Speaker 3>You are not right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2788
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:13.470
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have these memories of things </v>

2789
02:06:13.470 --> 02:06:15.801
<v Speaker 3>that you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used a weapon like four times to bust </v>

2790
02:06:15.801 --> 02:06:20.241
<v Speaker 3>into drug dealer's house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's one of the things that could have </v>

2791
02:06:20.241 --> 02:06:20.241
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2792
02:06:20.241 --> 02:06:23.960
<v Speaker 3>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other times I would just rob </v>

2793
02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:24.860
<v Speaker 3>them just because I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going giving me?</v>

2794
02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:27.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like thinking about that guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that pulled the knife on you.</v>

2795
02:06:27.540 --> 02:06:32.540
<v Speaker 3>What if after you beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he came back and tried to get you and </v>

2796
02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:35.241
<v Speaker 3>then escalated and next thing you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>he stabbed him or he shot him or easily </v>

2797
02:06:35.241 --> 02:06:35.520
<v Speaker 3>you could have murdered some.</v>

2798
02:06:35.530 --> 02:06:40.530
<v Speaker 3>I was so confused at that time in 1919.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's confused at 19 but 19 and </v>

2799
02:06:43.110 --> 02:06:46.410
<v Speaker 3>been through the shit that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>confused as I was.</v>

2800
02:06:46.411 --> 02:06:48.170
<v Speaker 3>I was really fucking confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

2801
02:06:48.171 --> 02:06:49.410
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2802
02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:54.440
<v Speaker 3>from I think till 20 something I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to kill my step dad and that was,</v>

2803
02:06:55.170 --> 02:07:00.170
<v Speaker 3>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was all that was getting consumed </v>

2804
02:07:00.170 --> 02:07:00.390
<v Speaker 3>with me like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my consumption,</v>

2805
02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:06.140
<v Speaker 3>like the pain that was going through </v>
<v Speaker 3>without my mom the drugs and killing my </v>

2806
02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:06.140
<v Speaker 3>Stepdad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stepdad.</v>

2807
02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:08.220
<v Speaker 3>But it wasn't about me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mom died without a will.</v>

2808
02:07:09.060 --> 02:07:11.310
<v Speaker 3>My mom didn't leave a will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he took all the money,</v>

2809
02:07:11.311 --> 02:07:13.230
<v Speaker 3>all the jewelry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't give me a piece,</v>

2810
02:07:13.231 --> 02:07:15.840
<v Speaker 3>I didn't collect social security,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2811
02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:17.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2812
02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:22.900
<v Speaker 3>my real father died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My real father was the first Cuban </v>

2813
02:07:22.900 --> 02:07:23.170
<v Speaker 3>committee man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you didn't city alright.</v>

2814
02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:28.340

<v Speaker 3>somebody gave him a package and it was </v>

2815
02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:29.580
<v Speaker 3>pure heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll align to that.</v>

2816
02:07:29.620 --> 02:07:34.620
<v Speaker 3>He died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took him to the hospital and they </v>

2817
02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:34.620
<v Speaker 3>never signed the death certificate in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Union City,</v>

2818
02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:36.130
<v Speaker 3>New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they forced</v>

2819
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:38.830
<v Speaker 2>my mother to take him back to Cuba in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1967.</v>

2820

<v Speaker 2>My mom had to take my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad's buried and cube.</v>

2824

<v Speaker 2>insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus my mom owned property with Miami </v>

02:09:01.231 --> 02:09:03.160
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got some ideas or maybe you don't</v>

2849
02:09:03.161 --> 02:09:05.610
<v Speaker 2>know what you want to do and you need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find something,</v>

2850
02:09:05.670 --> 02:09:10.670
<v Speaker 2>you're hungry and all of a sudden you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just get a giant chunk of money and </v>

2851
02:09:10.810 --> 02:09:14.350
<v Speaker 2>buying things and your ambitions gone.</v>

2852
02:09:15.450 --> 02:09:20.450
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind giving somebody start </v>

2853
02:09:20.450 --> 02:09:20.450
<v Speaker 2>startup money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you have to give you a child.</v>

2854
02:09:20.450 --> 02:09:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Some type of startup money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>son wrong with that,</v>

2855
02:09:22.660 --> 02:09:24.640
<v Speaker 2>but I'm talking about like winning the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lottery.</v>

2856
02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Like people win the lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a giant percentage of </v>

2857
02:09:30.341 --> 02:09:32.800
<v Speaker 2>them that ruined their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Giant.</v>

2858
02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:35.440
<v Speaker 2>Like they've done all these studies on </v>
<v Speaker 2>people winning the lottery.</v>

2859
02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:37.540
<v Speaker 2>So what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm giving you a bunch of money.</v>

2860
02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:42.100
<v Speaker 2>You didn't earn it like I'm giving you a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of money for sure.</v>

2861
02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Like think about you and all the money </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've earned in your life.</v>

2862
02:09:45.551 --> 02:09:47.500
<v Speaker 2>You've earned it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do all these shows.</v>

2863
02:09:47.501 --> 02:09:50.110
<v Speaker 2>You've built up a successful standup </v>
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>

2864
02:09:50.350 --> 02:09:53.980
<v Speaker 2>You built up a successful podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've done a lot of film and TV.</v>

2865
02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:57.000
<v Speaker 2>You've worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've worked right.</v>

2866
02:09:57.040 --> 02:09:58.750
<v Speaker 2>You've gathered up and you make a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>living.</v>

2867
02:09:58.750 --> 02:10:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is all from work,</v>

2868
02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:03.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a buildup to it.</v>

2869
02:10:03.220 --> 02:10:05.890
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an effort.</v>

2870
02:10:05.891 --> 02:10:08.950
<v Speaker 2>There's a reward for that effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's motivation,</v>

2871
02:10:09.010 --> 02:10:12.280
<v Speaker 2>there's disciplined is focused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's a payoff for all that.</v>

2872
02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:14.530
<v Speaker 2>If you just get the payoff with no </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline,</v>

2873
02:10:14.531 --> 02:10:16.180
<v Speaker 2>no focus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no lessons learned.</v>

2874
02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:19.420
<v Speaker 2>It's just not a healthy way to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>

2875
02:10:19.421 --> 02:10:24.421
<v Speaker 2>That's why rich kids are so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rich kids that grow up with trust funds </v>

2876
02:10:24.641 --> 02:10:26.170
<v Speaker 2>are all fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all of them.</v>

2877
02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:31.620
<v Speaker 2>A giant percentage of them are thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew a guy who was a rich guy and his </v>

2878
02:10:31.991 --> 02:10:33.920
<v Speaker 2>parents were fucking billionaires</v>

2879
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:38.030
<v Speaker 5>and he grew up with two trust funds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He burned through his first trust fund,</v>

2880
02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:43.330
<v Speaker 5>fuck that up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they had a backup trust fund </v>

2881
02:10:43.330 --> 02:10:46.001
<v Speaker 5>for forum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was buying houses and flipping them </v>

2882
02:10:46.001 --> 02:10:47.360
<v Speaker 5>and losing money and investing in </v>
<v Speaker 5>businesses and they all went under.</v>

2883
02:10:47.361 --> 02:10:52.361
<v Speaker 5>He had no discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no understanding of what money really </v>

2884
02:10:52.361 --> 02:10:54.020
<v Speaker 5>was and no hunger because he never had a</v>
<v Speaker 5>time in his life when he was poor.</v>

2885
02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:59.440
<v Speaker 5>He never had a time in his life where </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's worried about paying the bills and </v>

2886
02:10:59.440 --> 02:10:59.960
<v Speaker 5>if you don't have that and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have that real motivation,</v>

2887
02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:02.870
<v Speaker 5>I just don't think you ever really </v>
<v Speaker 5>appreciate success.</v>

2888
02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:07.900
<v Speaker 5>The people I think that appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 5>success are the people that worked for </v>

2889
02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:07.900
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

2890
02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:09.950
<v Speaker 5>You could remember back when you were </v>
<v Speaker 5>poor,</v>

2891
02:11:10.370 --> 02:11:12.770
<v Speaker 5>like I've had people say to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why do you do so many jobs?</v>

2892
02:11:12.770 --> 02:11:13.910
<v Speaker 5>Why do you have so many things you do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2893
02:11:13.911 --> 02:11:14.330
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

2894
02:11:14.331 --> 02:11:16.010
<v Speaker 5>Why do you keep moving?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do you do so much?</v>

2895
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:19.850
<v Speaker 5>Because I remember being scared.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember being broke.</v>

2896
02:11:19.970 --> 02:11:24.970
<v Speaker 5>I remember having no idea where the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>the money was coming from and what my </v>

2897
02:11:24.970 --> 02:11:26.540
<v Speaker 5>future was going to be and I was always </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrified of being a loser.</v>

2898
02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:31.220
<v Speaker 5>That's that feeling of not succeeding is</v>
<v Speaker 5>what motivates you.</v>

2899
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:35.300
<v Speaker 5>That knowing that you failed in the past</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that you know,</v>

2900
02:11:35.301 --> 02:11:39.790
<v Speaker 5>there's been many times where like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many times do you bombed and you get</v>

2901
02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:40.430
<v Speaker 5>off stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

2902
02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:42.230
<v Speaker 5>I can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a comedian.</v>

2903
02:11:42.231 --> 02:11:47.231
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I got to figure out what the fuck </v>

2904
02:11:47.231 --> 02:11:47.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing with my life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't go through those things,</v>

2905
02:11:47.421 --> 02:11:52.421
<v Speaker 5>if you don't have those experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't have those moments in your </v>

2906
02:11:52.421 --> 02:11:56.081
<v Speaker 5>life where you're unsure of the future,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to have the real </v>

2907
02:11:56.081 --> 02:12:00.281
<v Speaker 5>resolve that it takes to make it the </v>
<v Speaker 5>grit and determination that it takes to </v>

2908
02:12:00.281 --> 02:12:01.970
<v Speaker 5>move forward,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you don't have that,</v>

2909
02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:04.550
<v Speaker 5>any success that you do have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not gonna appreciate.</v>

2910
02:12:04.910 --> 02:12:06.950
<v Speaker 5>Nothing comes easy and if it does come </v>
<v Speaker 5>easy,</v>

2911
02:12:06.951 --> 02:12:08.240
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have it.</v>

2912
02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:11.790
<v Speaker 5>You don't really have it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing comes easy so far.</v>

2913
02:12:11.791 --> 02:12:14.610
<v Speaker 5>They would never stick with Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it was a mistake,</v>

2914
02:12:15.670 --> 02:12:20.670
<v Speaker 5>I would've quit your job to have because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so hard because I would have </v>

2915
02:12:20.670 --> 02:12:20.670
<v Speaker 5>thought I wouldn't be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2916
02:12:20.670 --> 02:12:22.760
<v Speaker 5>Once you try something new,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't do this,</v>

2917
02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:26.600
<v Speaker 5>but we come.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How fucking scary.</v>

2918
02:12:27.230 --> 02:12:32.230
<v Speaker 5>How weird is it that you want to chose a</v>
<v Speaker 5>career that basically for the first two </v>

2919
02:12:32.230 --> 02:12:34.460
<v Speaker 5>years when not going to get a dime,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not a dime and no,</v>

2920
02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:36.870
<v Speaker 5>no certainty at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody understands that.</v>

2921
02:12:37.130 --> 02:12:38.980
<v Speaker 5>Nobody understands that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that,</v>

2922
02:12:38.981 --> 02:12:40.730
<v Speaker 5>that you're not going to get a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>job,</v>

2923
02:12:40.731 --> 02:12:42.920
<v Speaker 5>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no pathway.</v>

2924
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:46.400
<v Speaker 5>It's like if you want to be a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go to college,</v>

2925
02:12:46.401 --> 02:12:48.260
<v Speaker 5>you get a degree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go to medical school,</v>

2926
02:12:48.261 --> 02:12:49.250
<v Speaker 5>you do your residency.</v>

2927
02:12:49.250 --> 02:12:51.530
<v Speaker 5>There's a pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That pathway is.</v>

2928
02:12:51.570 --> 02:12:53.240
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard work.</v>

2929
02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:58.540
<v Speaker 5>It's very difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not everyone's going to get through it </v>

2930
02:12:58.540 --> 02:12:58.880
<v Speaker 5>successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at least there's a pathway.</v>

2931
02:12:59.210 --> 02:13:02.270
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck is the pathway for being a</v>
<v Speaker 5>successful comedian?</v>

2932
02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:06.470
<v Speaker 5>Your pathway is different than mine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mine's different than Jenkins,</v>

2933
02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:10.370
<v Speaker 5>Duncan's or res.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all have different pathways.</v>

2934
02:13:10.670 --> 02:13:13.550
<v Speaker 5>We all have different styles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all have different points of view.</v>

2935
02:13:13.850 --> 02:13:16.010
<v Speaker 5>We all have different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We deliver material.</v>

2936
02:13:16.190 --> 02:13:19.010
<v Speaker 5>We all have different ways of writing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one can tell you what to do.</v>

2937
02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:21.950
<v Speaker 5>When you first got into this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did you think of any success?</v>

2938
02:13:22.130 --> 02:13:24.670
<v Speaker 5>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what did you think the outcome was going</v>

2939
02:13:24.671 --> 02:13:25.640
<v Speaker 5>to be?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because for me,</v>

2940
02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:31.600
<v Speaker 5>I thought that that was just going to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>a road comic and if I was an extra in </v>

2941
02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 5>the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be the best I would get.</v>

2942
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:33.780
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the honest truth.</v>

2943
02:13:34.230 --> 02:13:39.230
<v Speaker 3>Fitzsimmons and I was taught were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about this recently goes </v>

2944
02:13:39.230 --> 02:13:39.230
<v Speaker 3>fitzsimmons and I started out doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly the same time.</v>

2945
02:13:39.390 --> 02:13:42.720
<v Speaker 3>Our number one goal was being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional,</v>

2946
02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:45.030
<v Speaker 3>like getting paid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not having a day job.</v>

2947
02:13:45.150 --> 02:13:47.130
<v Speaker 3>That was the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being able to pay your bills.</v>

2948
02:13:47.131 --> 02:13:49.290
<v Speaker 3>That was my goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not having a day job.</v>

2949
02:13:49.710 --> 02:13:52.400
<v Speaker 3>I didn't care if I made $80,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$200 dollars.</v>

2950
02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:52.950
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no,</v>

2951
02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:53.580
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2952
02:13:53.850 --> 02:13:55.080
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no like,</v>

2953
02:13:55.081 --> 02:13:59.220
<v Speaker 3>I want to buy a mansion or I just want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be happy,</v>

2954
02:13:59.530 --> 02:14:04.530
<v Speaker 3>be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want a day job and I knew one </v>

2955
02:14:04.530 --> 02:14:06.960
<v Speaker 3>other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I got in that car in June of 95 and</v>

2956
02:14:06.961 --> 02:14:11.060
<v Speaker 3>I got on 30th street in boulder and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>headed out on the Irish.</v>

2957
02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:14.010
<v Speaker 3>There's a gas station there and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably had.</v>

2958
02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:17.730
<v Speaker 3>When I took my [inaudible] that I left </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the thing of a triple running.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was having so many problems in Denver </v>

<v Speaker 3>in his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood all over him.</v>

2973
02:15:01.591 --> 02:15:03.360
<v Speaker 3>That's all I kept thinking about.</v>

2976
02:15:08.361 --> 02:15:09.720

<v Speaker 3>then one day you find it and by that </v>
<v Speaker 3>time you've already got licensed.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But you got to remember from 91 to 93.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was part like convict.</v>

2990
02:15:51.330 --> 02:15:54.440
<v Speaker 3>I sold volumes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to buy coke?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I didn't write.</v>

2993
02:15:59.480 --> 02:15:59.850
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>

2994
02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:05.360
<v Speaker 3>I just knew I wanted to be a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a business card and I told people </v>

2995
02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:05.610
<v Speaker 3>I was going to be a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just lying.</v>

2996
02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:11.540
<v Speaker 3>But then I did a stint in New York for </v>
<v Speaker 3>nine months in 93 and that's where I </v>

2997
02:16:12.451 --> 02:16:15.540
<v Speaker 3>really got a hint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a standup comedy class.</v>

3010
02:16:55.300 --> 02:16:59.010
<v Speaker 3>When he told me he was friends with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he opened for you at the tree house.</v>

3071
02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:04.780
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you did that show.</v>

3072
02:20:04.870 --> 02:20:07.480
<v Speaker 5>Like it was a pack motherfucking room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

3073
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:09.190
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you killed those people.</v>

3074
02:20:09.250 --> 02:20:10.630
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you killed those people.</v>

3075
02:20:10.780 --> 02:20:12.870
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are real motherfucking comment.</v>

3076
02:20:12.970 --> 02:20:15.820
<v Speaker 5>And he walked away and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 5>feeling so good.</v>

3077
02:20:16.030 --> 02:20:20.350
<v Speaker 5>Like I can't believe Paul Mooney just </v>
<v Speaker 5>gave me a compliment.</v>

3078
02:20:20.380 --> 02:20:22.750
<v Speaker 5>Like he told me I was a real comic like </v>
<v Speaker 5>I was in.</v>

3079
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:25.930
<v Speaker 5>And then ever since then give me hugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every time he saw me,</v>

3080
02:20:26.510 --> 02:20:27.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is like,</v>

3081
02:20:27.940 --> 02:20:31.780
<v Speaker 5>you get that pat on the back that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know that thumbs up from someone who you</v>

3082
02:20:31.781 --> 02:20:34.030
<v Speaker 5>respect that that means the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>

3083
02:20:34.031 --> 02:20:36.130
<v Speaker 5>that's gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so huge.</v>

3084
02:20:36.730 --> 02:20:38.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when someone does that to you,</v>

3085
02:20:38.411 --> 02:20:41.740
<v Speaker 5>that the just the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wind in your sails,</v>

3086
02:20:42.220 --> 02:20:44.760
<v Speaker 5>it just can take you to a totally </v>
<v Speaker 5>different place because you,</v>

3087
02:20:44.761 --> 02:20:46.870
<v Speaker 5>you got the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got the stamp,</v>

3088
02:20:47.110 --> 02:20:49.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got a stamp of approval from someone</v>

3089
02:20:49.151 --> 02:20:51.740
<v Speaker 5>who's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forget</v>

3090
02:20:51.740 --> 02:20:56.740
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know the power of the comedy </v>

3091
02:20:56.740 --> 02:20:56.740
<v Speaker 3>store like I had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3092

<v Speaker 3>I read about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard about it from you and other </v>

3093
02:21:00.431 --> 02:21:02.801
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did Miami with Moody with this.</v>

3094
02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:08.720
<v Speaker 3>This has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh baby,</v>

<v Speaker 3>2000,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3097
02:21:15.020 --> 02:21:16.430
<v Speaker 3>I opened for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3098

<v Speaker 3>it's a two man show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just me and him at the Miami </v>

3099
02:21:21.490 --> 02:21:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm onstage and I just happened to catch</v>

<v Speaker 3>a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3102
02:21:25.490 --> 02:21:27.650
<v Speaker 3>the energy thing when you just kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3103
02:21:27.651 --> 02:21:32.651
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you used to crush the air because you </v>

3104
02:21:32.651 --> 02:21:32.651
<v Speaker 3>would do half your punchlines and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Spanish.</v>

3105

<v Speaker 3>I'm killing killing them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing them.</v>

3106
02:21:34.940 --> 02:21:38.780
<v Speaker 3>But I'm being dirty and I hear the door </v>
<v Speaker 3>open and Paul Mooney.</v>

3107
02:21:38.781 --> 02:21:42.390
<v Speaker 3>I could see him walking in and he looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>at me and I'm killing it.</v>

3108
02:21:42.450 --> 02:21:43.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm having a good set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's killing me,</v>

3109
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:44.510
<v Speaker 3>looking at me.</v>

3110
02:21:44.930 --> 02:21:49.100
<v Speaker 3>And he went out in the hallway and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>door was open and he kept yelling to the</v>

3111
02:21:49.101 --> 02:21:50.830
<v Speaker 3>staff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

3113
02:21:51.741 --> 02:21:53.420
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm being too dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3114
02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:57.440
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's going to complain about me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can Paul Mooney complain about?</v>

3115
02:21:57.550 --> 02:21:59.320
<v Speaker 3>They taught me this isn't true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3116
02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:04.600
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've known him from the store for five </v>

3117
02:22:04.600 --> 02:22:04.600
<v Speaker 3>fucking years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tommy,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's not out there going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm too dirty and shit.</v>

3119
02:22:05.620 --> 02:22:07.910
<v Speaker 3>But when I got out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hugged me when he came up,</v>

3120
02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:10.040
<v Speaker 3>can't keep it going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What time?</v>

3121
02:22:10.100 --> 02:22:12.110
<v Speaker 3>My little brother got off the stage and </v>

<v Speaker 3>fuck the fucking Improv's.</v>

3124
02:22:17.650 --> 02:22:19.120
<v Speaker 3>You don't taught him how to be like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3125
02:22:19.121 --> 02:22:21.860
<v Speaker 3>That's Mitzi shore by the that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the comedy store.</v>

02:22:22.190 --> 02:22:24.410
<v Speaker 3>He was back there yelling that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy store,</v>

3127
02:22:24.411 --> 02:22:26.370
<v Speaker 3>you went promise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't develop</v>

3128
02:22:26.380 --> 02:22:29.160
<v Speaker 5>deck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You listened to that.</v>

3129
02:22:29.180 --> 02:22:32.160
<v Speaker 5>That's the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what happens when you hang out at</v>

3130
02:22:32.161 --> 02:22:37.161
<v Speaker 5>the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why that little fat motherfucker </v>

02:22:37.161 --> 02:22:39.991
<v Speaker 5>is killing because that's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy store and that you know.</v>

3132
02:22:40.770 --> 02:22:42.360
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That feels tremendous.</v>

3133
02:22:42.361 --> 02:22:43.710
<v Speaker 5>One fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's in your corner.</v>

3134
02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:45.450
<v Speaker 5>It feels great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's.</v>

3135
02:22:46.170 --> 02:22:51.170
<v Speaker 5>He was something special.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would own the room to Paul Mooney </v>

3136
02:22:51.170 --> 02:22:51.870
<v Speaker 5>would sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It didn't matter what time he went up.</v>

3137
02:22:52.090 --> 02:22:53.670
<v Speaker 5>Didn't matter how many people in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>audience.</v>

3138
02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:56.430
<v Speaker 5>He would sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had a little tiny bottle of champagne</v>

3139
02:22:56.760 --> 02:22:59.790
<v Speaker 5>and he would take his fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would take his time.</v>

3140
02:23:00.450 --> 02:23:03.210
<v Speaker 5>How crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I learned so much from him.</v>

3141
02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:04.950
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How to control a room,</v>

3142
02:23:05.130 --> 02:23:07.240
<v Speaker 5>how to control,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not control rule,</v>

3143
02:23:07.260 --> 02:23:12.260
<v Speaker 5>meaning like you're a control freak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how to get everybody to pay </v>

3144
02:23:12.260 --> 02:23:16.311
<v Speaker 5>attention and lock into your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he didn't try to do a song and a </v>

3145
02:23:17.131 --> 02:23:20.010
<v Speaker 5>dance or people look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at me,</v>

3146
02:23:20.011 --> 02:23:20.430
<v Speaker 5>look at me.</v>

3147
02:23:20.580 --> 02:23:23.520
<v Speaker 5>He would just command presence with </v>
<v Speaker 5>excellence.</v>

3148
02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:27.060
<v Speaker 5>His material was excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His delivery was excellent.</v>

3149
02:23:27.061 --> 02:23:32.061
<v Speaker 5>He was calm and composed and you just </v>
<v Speaker 5>always felt like you were trying too </v>

3150
02:23:32.161 --> 02:23:33.720
<v Speaker 5>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you would watch him.</v>

3151
02:23:33.721 --> 02:23:38.721
<v Speaker 5>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gotta figure out a way that he's </v>

3152
02:23:38.721 --> 02:23:38.721
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>

3153
02:23:38.721 --> 02:23:38.721
<v Speaker 5>That's what he did teach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3154
02:23:38.721 --> 02:23:38.940
<v Speaker 5>Beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You give a fuck.</v>

3155
02:23:39.090 --> 02:23:41.370
<v Speaker 5>He didn't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he licked legitimately didn't give a</v>

3156
02:23:41.371 --> 02:23:42.690
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boy,</v>

<v Speaker 5>that guy got stole from a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot.</v>

3158
02:23:48.150 --> 02:23:51.930
<v Speaker 5>Men used to steal all his shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Switch out the word Nigger,</v>

3159
02:23:51.931 --> 02:23:56.931
<v Speaker 5>put in the word Mexican.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Switch it up about star wars and about </v>

3160
02:23:56.931 --> 02:23:57.930
<v Speaker 5>this and about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just.</v>

3161
02:23:57.960 --> 02:24:01.740
<v Speaker 5>And you would see the different because </v>
<v Speaker 5>moonee would go on after men see it too,</v>

3162
02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:04.590
<v Speaker 5>like been sealed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would go on before him and to his shit.</v>

3163
02:24:04.591 --> 02:24:07.010
<v Speaker 5>And then moonee would go on afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can give a fuck,</v>

3164
02:24:07.110 --> 02:24:07.980
<v Speaker 5>just did a shit.</v>

3165
02:24:08.430 --> 02:24:10.650
<v Speaker 5>But he knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would be very frustrated by it,</v>

3166
02:24:11.500 --> 02:24:12.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was a,</v>

3167
02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:18.020
<v Speaker 5>it was a big influence to a lot of us </v>
<v Speaker 5>that got to see and watch him because we</v>

3168
02:24:18.811 --> 02:24:21.180
<v Speaker 5>all knew his history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3169
02:24:21.181 --> 02:24:26.181
<v Speaker 5>he was one of the head writers for </v>
<v Speaker 5>arguably the greatest comedian of all </v>

3170
02:24:26.181 --> 02:24:27.150
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3171
02:24:27.380 --> 02:24:30.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was one of the feel.</v>

3172
02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:31.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Richard Pryor.</v>

3173
02:24:31.410 --> 02:24:36.410
<v Speaker 5>You'd think that I feel it too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if there's a big argument or that </v>

3174
02:24:36.410 --> 02:24:40.800
<v Speaker 5>argument with the other dude who had all</v>
<v Speaker 5>those specials,</v>

3175
02:24:41.010 --> 02:24:43.500
<v Speaker 5>which is I can't think of as George </v>
<v Speaker 5>Carlin's.</v>

3176
02:24:43.501 --> 02:24:48.501
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I can give you the nod.</v>

3177
02:24:48.990 --> 02:24:50.160
<v Speaker 5>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's clear.</v>

3178
02:24:50.161 --> 02:24:51.450
<v Speaker 5>It's clear as day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

3179
02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:54.030
<v Speaker 5>This is not a knock on George Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was a great comedian.</v>

3180
02:24:54.031 --> 02:24:58.620
<v Speaker 5>He's a great comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>George Carlin to me was more of a social</v>

3181
02:24:58.621 --> 02:25:00.540
<v Speaker 5>spokesman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he was a,</v>

3182
02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:04.590
<v Speaker 5>a social commentator and he was a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>great comedian as well.</v>

3183
02:25:04.590 --> 02:25:09.590
<v Speaker 5>He had some funny material for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But George Carlin did a special every </v>

3184
02:25:09.590 --> 02:25:09.750
<v Speaker 5>year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every year.</v>

3185
02:25:09.751 --> 02:25:12.810
<v Speaker 5>He did a special and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3186
02:25:12.811 --> 02:25:17.811
<v Speaker 5>his body of work is certainly larger </v>
<v Speaker 5>than anybody else's and he's certainly </v>

3187
02:25:17.811 --> 02:25:22.071
<v Speaker 5>one of the all time greats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but to me there was something about </v>

3188
02:25:22.071 --> 02:25:25.521
<v Speaker 5>prior that was just so special and </v>
<v Speaker 5>unique and powerful and just just </v>

3189
02:25:26.741 --> 02:25:27.850
<v Speaker 5>resonated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

3190
02:25:27.851 --> 02:25:30.790
<v Speaker 5>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll never forget listening to his stuff</v>

3191
02:25:30.791 --> 02:25:34.690
<v Speaker 5>when I was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Me and my girlfriend in high school,</v>

3192
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:40.590
<v Speaker 5>I think I was like 16.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was 15 and we were in my room </v>

3193
02:25:40.590 --> 02:25:44.881
<v Speaker 5>listening to Richard Pryor on a cassette</v>
<v Speaker 5>and just cry and laugh and sitting on my</v>

3194
02:25:45.041 --> 02:25:47.320
<v Speaker 5>bed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>laugh and laugh and,</v>

3195
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:50.530
<v Speaker 5>and I'll never forget.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll never forget going to see him.</v>

3196
02:25:50.531 --> 02:25:55.531
<v Speaker 5>My parents took me to see live on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sunset strip when I was like 14 or 13 or</v>

3197
02:25:56.861 --> 02:25:57.610
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

3198
02:25:57.880 --> 02:26:02.880
<v Speaker 5>I'll never forget being in that movie </v>
<v Speaker 5>theater laughing so fucking hard and </v>

3199
02:26:03.311 --> 02:26:07.270
<v Speaker 5>looking around at people like walking </v>
<v Speaker 5>back and forth on their chairs.</v>

3200
02:26:07.690 --> 02:26:11.740
<v Speaker 5>And all I remember thinking is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe this guy's just talking.</v>

3201
02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:14.810
<v Speaker 5>Like I'd seen all these amazing movies </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3202
02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:17.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>back to school or stripes or you know,</v>

3203
02:26:17.930 --> 02:26:20.650
<v Speaker 5>name the comedy movies that you've seen </v>
<v Speaker 5>all these years.</v>

3204
02:26:20.651 --> 02:26:23.470
<v Speaker 5>I saw all these comedy movies that were </v>
<v Speaker 5>great and funny,</v>

3205
02:26:23.620 --> 02:26:26.920
<v Speaker 5>but they were never this funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this guy's just talking.</v>

3206
02:26:26.980 --> 02:26:31.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this has got to be the funniest shit of </v>

3207
02:26:31.980 --> 02:26:34.171
<v Speaker 5>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's just talking and especially </v>

3208
02:26:34.171 --> 02:26:34.171
<v Speaker 5>when.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

3209
02:26:34.171 --> 02:26:34.570
<v Speaker 5>this is 82.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3210
02:26:34.660 --> 02:26:37.630
<v Speaker 5>So I guess I was 15,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's 14 or 15.</v>

3211
02:26:37.820 --> 02:26:40.750
<v Speaker 5>That's when it came out was 82,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I was 15.</v>

3212
02:26:41.740 --> 02:26:46.740
<v Speaker 5>So watching this as a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it planted the seed in my head like,</v>

3213
02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:48.640
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

3214
02:26:49.090 --> 02:26:52.210
<v Speaker 5>Like how is it possible that this guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>can do this?</v>

3215
02:26:52.211 --> 02:26:57.211
<v Speaker 5>That he can just talk and that talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>and just explaining your life </v>

3216
02:26:58.361 --> 02:27:03.361
<v Speaker 5>experiences can be so hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the seed that was planted in my </v>

3217
02:27:03.361 --> 02:27:03.361
<v Speaker 5>head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3218
02:27:03.361 --> 02:27:05.170
<v Speaker 5>I never thought I was going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>comedian.</v>

3219
02:27:05.171 --> 02:27:07.300
<v Speaker 5>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never had any aspirations.</v>

3220
02:27:08.020 --> 02:27:08.770
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3222
02:27:10.450 --> 02:27:11.890
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>We just communicated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm still one of my best friends to this</v>

<v Speaker 5>that guy is the guy who talked me into </v>

3225
02:27:21.090 --> 02:27:22.390
<v Speaker 5>doing comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was training.</v>

3226
02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:26.830
<v Speaker 5>That's when I was competing and I just </v>
<v Speaker 5>loved comedy as a thing.</v>

3227
02:27:26.831 --> 02:27:31.831
<v Speaker 5>I just loved comedy and I would always </v>
<v Speaker 5>make fun of people and do like </v>

3228
02:27:31.831 --> 02:27:32.560
<v Speaker 5>impressions of people having sex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like our friends.</v>

3229
02:27:32.561 --> 02:27:33.280
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3230
02:27:33.281 --> 02:27:38.281
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would just try to make everybody </v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3232
02:27:38.281 --> 02:27:38.410

<v Speaker 5>room.</v>

3233
02:27:38.410 --> 02:27:43.410
<v Speaker 5>Everybody would be nervous before </v>
<v Speaker 5>sparring or everybody be nervous when </v>

3234
02:27:43.410 --> 02:27:44.590
<v Speaker 5>we're on our way to fights and </v>
<v Speaker 5>tournaments and stuff like that.</v>

3235
02:27:44.591 --> 02:27:49.591
<v Speaker 5>I would be the guy that made everybody </v>
<v Speaker 5>laugh and he pulled me aside and he just</v>

3236
02:27:50.831 --> 02:27:52.780
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could be a comedian.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

3239
02:27:57.130 --> 02:27:59.620
<v Speaker 5>I remember saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think I'm funny because you like me.</v>

3240
02:27:59.740 --> 02:28:04.740
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>other people are gonna think I'm an </v>

3241
02:28:04.740 --> 02:28:04.740
<v Speaker 5>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I say fucked up things.</v>

3242
02:28:04.740 --> 02:28:06.340
<v Speaker 5>Like I say fucked up things because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>around all these savages.</v>

3243
02:28:06.700 --> 02:28:11.700
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm around like Leroy Rodriguez and I </v>

3244
02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:12.610
<v Speaker 5>had a friend named major battle that was</v>
<v Speaker 5>his name.</v>

3245
02:28:12.730 --> 02:28:16.420
<v Speaker 5>His real name was major battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was one of a j dot Kim's black belts,</v>

3246
02:28:17.140 --> 02:28:22.140
<v Speaker 5>Larry Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these guys were savages and they </v>

3247
02:28:22.140 --> 02:28:22.140
<v Speaker 5>were just fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3248
02:28:22.140 --> 02:28:27.010
<v Speaker 5>and so I could say fucked up things </v>
<v Speaker 5>around them because they were used to </v>

3249
02:28:27.010 --> 02:28:30.851
<v Speaker 5>kick and people in the head and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>used to fighting and tournaments and </v>

3250
02:28:30.851 --> 02:28:34.720
<v Speaker 5>taken,</v>
<v Speaker 5>taken bus trips to go kick the shit out </v>

3251
02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:34.720
<v Speaker 5>of people.</v>

3252
02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:35.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean that was what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what everybody did back then.</v>

3253
02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:40.870
<v Speaker 5>So the way I felt about it was like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>making a group of very crazy people </v>

3254
02:28:42.021 --> 02:28:43.460
<v Speaker 5>laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like these are like,</v>

3255
02:28:43.461 --> 02:28:45.120
<v Speaker 5>we're all misfits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3256
02:28:45.380 --> 02:28:50.380
<v Speaker 5>we were all like people that didn't fit </v>
<v Speaker 5>in in a normal world because we were </v>

3257
02:28:50.541 --> 02:28:55.541
<v Speaker 5>just fighting and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll laugh because they're crazy and </v>

3258
02:28:55.731 --> 02:28:59.420
<v Speaker 5>they're all punching people and kicking </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and this is a different world.</v>

3259
02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:04.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>other people are not going to think I'm </v>

3260
02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:06.191
<v Speaker 5>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he talked me into it and so from </v>

3261
02:29:06.191 --> 02:29:07.580
<v Speaker 5>there I started writing some stuff down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I waited about six months until I turned</v>

3262
02:29:07.581 --> 02:29:11.520
<v Speaker 5>21.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to an open mic and then uh,</v>

3263
02:29:11.690 --> 02:29:15.260
<v Speaker 5>after I turned 21,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like maybe,</v>

3264
02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:17.870
<v Speaker 5>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sixteen days later I went onstage.</v>

3265
02:29:18.020 --> 02:29:19.790
<v Speaker 5>I turned 21,</v>
<v Speaker 5>August 11,</v>

3266
02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:23.630
<v Speaker 5>1988 and then August 27th I went </v>
<v Speaker 5>onstage.</v>

3267
02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:25.880
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3268
02:29:27.060 --> 02:29:30.480
<v Speaker 5>But that was just 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone telling me to do it 100 percent.</v>

3269
02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:35.600
<v Speaker 5>I always loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to watch evening at the Improv </v>

3270
02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:35.600
<v Speaker 5>and I would always watch stand up on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>tonight show,</v>

3271
02:29:35.670 --> 02:29:37.920
<v Speaker 5>but I just loved it like the way I like </v>
<v Speaker 5>music now,</v>

3272
02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:43.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I love watching music or listening </v>

3273
02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:43.160
<v Speaker 5>to music.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have any talent,</v>

3274
02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:44.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't have any aspirations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I love,</v>

3275
02:29:44.910 --> 02:29:47.010
<v Speaker 5>I just love music.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To me it's just,</v>

3276
02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:49.890
<v Speaker 5>it does something to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes me feel good.</v>

3277
02:29:49.891 --> 02:29:51.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm a fan of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3278
02:29:51.150 --> 02:29:54.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm a fan of a lot of shit that I'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>never do but stand up.</v>

3279
02:29:54.391 --> 02:29:56.190
<v Speaker 5>It was just one of those things like I </v>
<v Speaker 5>just love it</v>

3280
02:29:56.230 --> 02:30:00.290
<v Speaker 6>doing it and I would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3281
02:30:00.690 --> 02:30:05.640
<v Speaker 5>it would just be my number one source of</v>
<v Speaker 5>release as far as like a entertainment.</v>

3282
02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:08.070
<v Speaker 5>It's funny that you say that about words</v>

3283
02:30:08.130 --> 02:30:13.130
<v Speaker 3>because for me I was listening to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Beatles with my buddy and he had an </v>

3284
02:30:13.130 --> 02:30:17.340
<v Speaker 3>older brother that was a junkie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I discovered Richard Pryor.</v>

3285
02:30:17.700 --> 02:30:22.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were listening to the Beatles like I </v>

3286
02:30:22.700 --> 02:30:23.160
<v Speaker 3>want to hold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then went like,</v>

3287
02:30:23.161 --> 02:30:25.500
<v Speaker 3>this is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his brother came and said,</v>

3288
02:30:25.501 --> 02:30:27.420
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You faggots listened to them.</v>

3289
02:30:28.280 --> 02:30:29.880
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll listen to the Beatles,</v>

3290
02:30:29.881 --> 02:30:30.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all excited.</v>

3291
02:30:30.901 --> 02:30:32.370
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take that shit off.</v>

3292
02:30:33.210 --> 02:30:38.210
<v Speaker 3>They took this album cover out with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>black dude on it and also they put some </v>

3293
02:30:38.210 --> 02:30:42.621
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear this fucking laughter and I'm </v>

3294
02:30:42.621 --> 02:30:44.451
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this shit all a sudden </v>

3295
02:30:44.451 --> 02:30:44.451
<v Speaker 3>come and kind of say Richard Pryor and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3296
02:30:44.820 --> 02:30:49.280
<v Speaker 3>and after that first side I was done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like once I heard the wine,</v>

<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

3302
02:31:05.970 --> 02:31:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Those are the two ounces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know which one.</v>

3303
02:31:08.220 --> 02:31:10.710
<v Speaker 3>When I heard the last cut on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the wine.</v>

3304
02:31:10.711 --> 02:31:11.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meets Dracula.</v>

3305
02:31:11.940 --> 02:31:14.430
<v Speaker 3>I was hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I left it.</v>

3306
02:31:14.431 --> 02:31:19.431
<v Speaker 3>I bought the album.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I brought it home that I bought </v>

3307
02:31:19.431 --> 02:31:20.020
<v Speaker 3>bicentennial Nigga and there's a friend </v>
<v Speaker 3>of my</v>

3308

<v Speaker 5>He was a vp of a Scifi and he goes,</v>

3312
02:31:32.511 --> 02:31:35.370

<v Speaker 5>We used to have a band.</v>

3313
02:31:35.910 --> 02:31:38.040
<v Speaker 5>I used to be a singer in this band in </v>
<v Speaker 5>sixth grade,</v>

3314
02:31:39.620 --> 02:31:41.970

<v Speaker 5>a dealer and John Bender.</v>

<v Speaker 5>the Niggas put that nigger's crazy.</v>

3319
02:31:52.201 --> 02:31:57.201
<v Speaker 5>Look at the title.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They put like an asterisk where the eye </v>

3320
02:31:57.201 --> 02:31:59.160
<v Speaker 5>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is wrong with people,</v>

3321
02:31:59.430 --> 02:32:04.430
<v Speaker 5>but meanwhile it says it on the album,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they have the picture where you see</v>

3322
02:32:04.561 --> 02:32:07.310
<v Speaker 5>him on the album and it says Nig,</v>
<v Speaker 5>g,</v>

3323
02:32:07.311 --> 02:32:08.050
<v Speaker 5>e,</v>
<v Speaker 5>r,</v>

3324
02:32:08.310 --> 02:32:12.000
<v Speaker 5>but then they have the actual title for </v>
<v Speaker 5>sale.</v>

3325
02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:15.270
<v Speaker 5>What's the website?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was LP.</v>

3326
02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:16.950
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's an LP.</v>

3327
02:32:16.980 --> 02:32:19.050
<v Speaker 5>You can get that in final.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3328
02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:22.770
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that face to young then man.</v>

3329
02:32:22.771 --> 02:32:24.420
<v Speaker 5>He's like in his thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

3330
02:32:24.421 --> 02:32:27.000
<v Speaker 5>he was good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See to me it's like I have,</v>

3331
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:29.490
<v Speaker 5>this is my version of um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

3332
02:32:29.491 --> 02:32:34.491
<v Speaker 5>like evolutionary charter comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the guy who started it all off </v>

3333
02:32:34.491 --> 02:32:34.491
<v Speaker 5>is lenny bruce.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We too.</v>

3334
02:32:34.620 --> 02:32:38.640
<v Speaker 5>So I have Lenny Bruce posters framed on </v>
<v Speaker 5>my wall.</v>

3335
02:32:38.850 --> 02:32:41.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean like I just feel like I don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3336
02:32:41.640 --> 02:32:46.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't enjoy watching him or listening </v>
<v Speaker 5>to him as much because I don't think he </v>

3337
02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:51.351
<v Speaker 5>was as good today because I think that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the culture was so different back then </v>

3338
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:54.310
<v Speaker 5>that it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very difficult for us to,</v>

3339
02:32:54.380 --> 02:32:59.380
<v Speaker 5>to sing like the things that he's saying</v>
<v Speaker 5>or not groundbreaking today because he </v>

3340
02:32:59.380 --> 02:33:02.250
<v Speaker 5>already broke that ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the culture shifted with it.</v>

3341
02:33:02.250 --> 02:33:04.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not just him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of other people,</v>

3342
02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:09.560
<v Speaker 5>a lot of other authors and politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these different people broke </v>

3343
02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:10.020
<v Speaker 5>different ground and culture's evolved </v>
<v Speaker 5>since then.</v>

3344
02:33:10.860 --> 02:33:15.860
<v Speaker 5>But I think Richard Pryor took what he </v>
<v Speaker 5>did and the honesty that lenny bruce </v>

3345
02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:19.710
<v Speaker 5>exhibited on stage and he brought it to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the next level.</v>

3346
02:33:20.210 --> 02:33:21.780
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he took it to a new place.</v>

3347
02:33:22.110 --> 02:33:23.000
<v Speaker 5>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3348
02:33:23.010 --> 02:33:28.010
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that happens a lot when people are </v>

3349
02:33:28.010 --> 02:33:30.441
<v Speaker 5>influenced by other people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's one of the things that's </v>

3350
02:33:30.441 --> 02:33:30.780
<v Speaker 5>really important,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the distinction between being influenced</v>

3351
02:33:30.781 --> 02:33:32.340
<v Speaker 5>and stealing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3352
02:33:33.030 --> 02:33:38.030
<v Speaker 5>I think we all influenced each other and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you guys influenced me like Ari </v>

3353
02:33:39.061 --> 02:33:42.420
<v Speaker 5>and Dunkin and you and all of us </v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

3354
02:33:42.490 --> 02:33:43.530
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tom,</v>

3355
02:33:43.570 --> 02:33:48.570
<v Speaker 5>Bert,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we influenced each other and we inspire </v>

3356
02:33:48.570 --> 02:33:50.820
<v Speaker 5>each other and that when you see someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>do really good stuff,</v>

3357
02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:53.730
<v Speaker 5>like you want to do more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bird does it to me,</v>

3358
02:33:53.731 --> 02:33:54.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Louis,</v>

3359
02:33:54.930 --> 02:33:57.330
<v Speaker 5>you see someone doing really what </v>
<v Speaker 5>Chappelle,</v>

3360
02:33:57.420 --> 02:34:02.420
<v Speaker 5>you see really good comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to do more really good comedy </v>

3361
02:34:02.420 --> 02:34:02.460
<v Speaker 5>and everyone's sort of influencing </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>

3362
02:34:03.090 --> 02:34:08.090
<v Speaker 5>So I think that honesty that Lenny Bruce</v>
<v Speaker 5>expressed was so unique for the time,</v>

3363
02:34:11.750 --> 02:34:15.950
<v Speaker 5>if there was no one had ever done any </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of social commentary in,</v>

3364
02:34:15.951 --> 02:34:16.500
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a,</v>

3365
02:34:16.510 --> 02:34:17.890
<v Speaker 5>in a comedy form,</v>

3366
02:34:18.370 --> 02:34:23.370
<v Speaker 2>the way that lenny had done so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Richard Pryor took it and just </v>

3367
02:34:23.370 --> 02:34:23.800
<v Speaker 2>blew it out of the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3368
02:34:23.801 --> 02:34:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Richard Pryor was raised in brothels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was raised in a brothel.</v>

3369
02:34:28.031 --> 02:34:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was raised in a whorehouse in Peoria,</v>

3370
02:34:30.221 --> 02:34:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Illinois.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3371
02:34:31.571 --> 02:34:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Richard Pryor was experiencing life in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different way,</v>

3372
02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:40.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all his experiences with drugs and </v>

3373
02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:40.720
<v Speaker 2>craziness and wild people growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

3374
02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:44.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comedy of the time shifting from the</v>

3375
02:34:44.501 --> 02:34:49.501
<v Speaker 2>sixties into the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became this thing that he was at the </v>

3376
02:34:49.501 --> 02:34:50.980
<v Speaker 2>forefront of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in my opinion,</v>

3377
02:34:50.981 --> 02:34:53.650
<v Speaker 2>he's like the most revolutionary figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>in all comedy.</v>

3378
02:34:53.890 --> 02:34:54.580
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3379
02:34:55.060 --> 02:34:58.750
<v Speaker 2>he was just so different and so unique </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so polished.</v>

3380
02:34:58.751 --> 02:34:59.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was,</v>

3381
02:34:59.861 --> 02:35:03.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was living with my roommates and like,</v>

3382
02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:06.370
<v Speaker 2>because it was like 87 or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3383
02:35:06.680 --> 02:35:09.490
<v Speaker 2>We had this place in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in revere.</v>

3384
02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:11.980
<v Speaker 2>We're all living together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't malted Malt,</v>

3385
02:35:12.380 --> 02:35:14.570
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck we were were living </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

3386
02:35:14.571 --> 02:35:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was Lynn,</v>

3387
02:35:15.550 --> 02:35:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Lynn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts near the beach and we all </v>

3388
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:23.680
<v Speaker 2>watched a Sam Kennison special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was hilarious.</v>

3389
02:35:23.710 --> 02:35:26.680
<v Speaker 2>It was really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then we watched prior,</v>

3390
02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:28.570
<v Speaker 2>after we watched Kennison and we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3391
02:35:28.571 --> 02:35:32.790
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look how much smoother prior is like.</v>

3392
02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:35.230
<v Speaker 2>That's what I remember thinking and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember my friend bill,</v>

3393
02:35:35.231 --> 02:35:38.950
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look how much more black polished he is.</v>

3394
02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:40.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the word,</v>

3395
02:35:40.121 --> 02:35:41.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like polished.</v>

3396
02:35:41.201 --> 02:35:41.710
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3397
02:35:41.711 --> 02:35:44.290
<v Speaker 2>he's like smooth there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was smoother.</v>

3398
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:47.170
<v Speaker 2>He just had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a different sort of style.</v>

3399
02:35:47.171 --> 02:35:52.171
<v Speaker 2>Whereas kinison was just kinison was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just kickstart and everything and just </v>

3400
02:35:52.171 --> 02:35:53.770
<v Speaker 2>fucking knock it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to see him coming,</v>

3401
02:35:54.220 --> 02:35:55.360
<v Speaker 2>but let me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his name?</v>

3402
02:35:55.361 --> 02:35:57.850
<v Speaker 2>What's the Lenny Bruce?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lenny.</v>

3403
02:35:57.851 --> 02:36:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Bruce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think his materials outrageous,</v>

3404
02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:01.900
<v Speaker 2>but I liked this cadence.</v>

3405
02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3406

<v Speaker 2>You do it man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I told the guy,</v>

3407
02:36:06.251 --> 02:36:08.800
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got some jokes that hold up.</v>

3408
02:36:08.890 --> 02:36:11.990
<v Speaker 2>Listen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come back in a little while too,</v>

3409
02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:14.850

<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you build to Wordsmith,</v>

3410
02:36:15.110 --> 02:36:20.110

<v Speaker 8>like a sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you may know his name is Paul Coats.</v>

3470
02:40:05.421 --> 02:40:10.421

<v Speaker 8>eight and nine years old that was </v>

<v Speaker 8>That's good.</v>

3478
02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:45.440
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3479
02:40:45.441 --> 02:40:48.350
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't really translate today </v>
<v Speaker 5>because we're just.</v>

3480
02:40:48.740 --> 02:40:52.400
<v Speaker 5>This was irreverent and crazy back then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but today we're like,</v>

3481
02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:55.040
<v Speaker 5>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very interesting.</v>

3482
02:40:55.420 --> 02:40:58.040
<v Speaker 5>He was getting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was doing his thing.</v>

3483
02:40:58.220 --> 02:40:59.570
<v Speaker 5>It's historic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3484
02:40:59.571 --> 02:41:04.571
<v Speaker 5>So you're watching this and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>hearing people laugh and you've got to </v>

3485
02:41:04.571 --> 02:41:04.571
<v Speaker 5>put your.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3486
02:41:04.571 --> 02:41:08.170
<v Speaker 5>it's impossible to enjoy this without </v>
<v Speaker 5>understanding the context of the time </v>

3487
02:41:09.591 --> 02:41:11.990
<v Speaker 5>that he was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you have to Kinda like put yourself</v>

<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

3489
02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:17.390
<v Speaker 5>Whereas I think prior stuff's still </v>
<v Speaker 5>translates today.</v>

3490
02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:22.720
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of prior material that </v>

3491
02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:22.720
<v Speaker 5>you'll watch today and you'll still </v>
<v Speaker 5>laugh your ass off.</v>

3492
02:41:22.940 --> 02:41:27.940
<v Speaker 5>Stuff of him going back to Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff of him shooting his car because </v>

3493
02:41:27.940 --> 02:41:29.330
<v Speaker 5>his girlfriend's trying to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he shot the car.</v>

3494
02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:32.900
<v Speaker 5>Like he's got some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some bits that are still to this day,</v>

3495
02:41:32.930 --> 02:41:34.190

02:41:37.040 --> 02:41:41.210
<v Speaker 5>Massively influenced Chris rock who was </v>
<v Speaker 5>influenced by Eddie Murphy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Martin Lawrence was on fire and he </v>

<v Speaker 2>gun.</v>

3568
02:45:00.450 --> 02:45:05.450
<v Speaker 2>They got pulled over and he said he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>dehydrated and it was on some sort of </v>

3569
02:45:05.450 --> 02:45:05.450
<v Speaker 2>drugs and they locked him up in a psych </v>
<v Speaker 2>ward.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of nutty shit with </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

3571
02:45:07.161 --> 02:45:12.161
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people forgot how God damn good he </v>

3572
02:45:12.161 --> 02:45:12.400
<v Speaker 2>was when he was in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when he was in his prime,</v>

<v Speaker 2>But that's not the price.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the stand up though was what was </v>

3575
02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:23.731
<v Speaker 2>up when I saw him at the comedy store </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would wear fucking like leather </v>

<v Speaker 2>place apart.</v>

3577
02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:31.920
<v Speaker 2>He was on fire and he was another one </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had a bunch of jokes that people </v>

3578
02:45:33.171 --> 02:45:38.171

<v Speaker 2>offensive material?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I believe he got caught up in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversy about offensive material to.</v>

<v Speaker 2>four.</v>

3640
02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:20.980
<v Speaker 2>That's when I had to move to California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was miserable.</v>

3641
02:48:23.140 --> 02:48:26.530
<v Speaker 2>I was shooting this the first couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks we'll get me.</v>

3642
02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:28.930
<v Speaker 2>I was like 26.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are so weird.</v>

3643
02:48:29.410 --> 02:48:30.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

3644
02:48:30.731 --> 02:48:31.690
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

3645
02:48:31.780 --> 02:48:35.560
<v Speaker 2>when it first started out it was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

3646
02:48:35.561 --> 02:48:38.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened was with twitch TV shows,</v>

3647
02:48:38.980 --> 02:48:43.980
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times you have like these </v>
<v Speaker 2>really funny writers and these guys who </v>

3648
02:48:43.980 --> 02:48:45.670
<v Speaker 2>wrote it originally were really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

3649
02:48:45.671 --> 02:48:50.671
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had written from married with </v>

3650
02:48:50.671 --> 02:48:52.111
<v Speaker 2>children and the simpsons and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>network had decided for some reason they</v>

3651
02:48:53.321 --> 02:48:57.040
<v Speaker 2>weren't strong enough to run the show </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they were only writers.</v>

3652
02:48:57.070 --> 02:48:59.890
<v Speaker 2>They weren't like a real show runner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they brought in.</v>

3653
02:48:59.891 --> 02:49:04.891
<v Speaker 2>This guy was a show runner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was terrible and I didn't get along </v>

3654
02:49:04.891 --> 02:49:08.160
<v Speaker 2>with him at all and they were actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to firing me or him</v>

3655
02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:13.280
<v Speaker 5>like there was like a real impasse </v>
<v Speaker 5>between the two of us because the guys </v>

3656
02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:15.090
<v Speaker 5>riding was dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was crazy back then.</v>

3657
02:49:15.091 --> 02:49:17.550
<v Speaker 5>Did I didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had zero filter.</v>

3658
02:49:17.580 --> 02:49:19.590
<v Speaker 5>I never thought I was going to be an </v>
<v Speaker 5>actor in the first place.</v>

3659
02:49:19.591 --> 02:49:24.591
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't believe him on the set.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they would try to get me to do </v>

3660
02:49:24.591 --> 02:49:24.591
<v Speaker 5>stuff and it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

3661
02:49:24.591 --> 02:49:26.280
<v Speaker 5>And they would like give me the script.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like wow,</v>

3662
02:49:26.281 --> 02:49:29.760
<v Speaker 5>we made revisions to the script and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>would read it goes this fucking terrible</v>

3663
02:49:29.761 --> 02:49:31.680
<v Speaker 5>and they would get pissed at me and </v>
<v Speaker 5>people will be pissed.</v>

3664
02:49:31.681 --> 02:49:34.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to tell me how this is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Explain to me how this is funny.</v>

3665
02:49:34.950 --> 02:49:36.820
<v Speaker 5>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like executives are going,</v>

3666
02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:38.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking to my agent,</v>

3667
02:49:38.791 --> 02:49:39.530
<v Speaker 5>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3668
02:49:39.610 --> 02:49:44.610
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's very arrogant and he's causing </v>

3669
02:49:44.610 --> 02:49:45.750
<v Speaker 5>problems on the set and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not causing problems in the set.</v>

3670
02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:47.340
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they took the writer stuff,</v>

3671
02:49:47.341 --> 02:49:49.380
<v Speaker 5>they rewrote it and they turned it into </v>
<v Speaker 5>dog shit,</v>

3672
02:49:49.580 --> 02:49:51.060
<v Speaker 5>you show me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>show me how it's not,</v>

3673
02:49:51.550 --> 02:49:56.550
<v Speaker 5>and I was like very close to like </v>
<v Speaker 5>killing my sitcom career completely just</v>

3674
02:49:58.741 --> 02:50:01.620
<v Speaker 5>by having no filter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then they realized it,</v>

3675
02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:04.470
<v Speaker 5>they read it and then they came and </v>
<v Speaker 5>watched some of the run throughs and the</v>

3676
02:50:04.471 --> 02:50:06.390
<v Speaker 5>network fired him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was close.</v>

3677
02:50:06.391 --> 02:50:09.900
<v Speaker 5>He wanted me out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was one of the stars of the show.</v>

3678
02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:13.410
<v Speaker 5>It was me and Ben Greenwood Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>

3679
02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:15.870
<v Speaker 5>And then I mean it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was an ensemble show,</v>

3680
02:50:15.871 --> 02:50:19.170
<v Speaker 5>but I played the star player.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was,</v>

3681
02:50:19.171 --> 02:50:24.171
<v Speaker 5>there was about a baseball team of </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked up baseball team and I was the </v>

3682
02:50:24.171 --> 02:50:27.770
<v Speaker 5>guy who was always causing trouble and </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrecking his car and going crazy and so </v>

3683
02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:30.090
<v Speaker 5>they were having a real problem with me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was,</v>

3684
02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:33.510
<v Speaker 5>it was because these guys that had </v>
<v Speaker 5>originally wrote it,</v>

3685
02:50:34.050 --> 02:50:35.310
<v Speaker 5>these guys were genius.</v>

3686
02:50:35.310 --> 02:50:40.310
<v Speaker 5>They were really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really funny and they took their words </v>

3687
02:50:40.310 --> 02:50:42.960
<v Speaker 5>and just butchered it and turned into </v>
<v Speaker 5>some hackneyed fucked up sitcoms,</v>

3688

<v Speaker 5>And so I'm like,</v>

3713
02:51:56.251 --> 02:52:01.251
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to stay here because I got a </v>

3714
02:52:01.251 --> 02:52:01.251
<v Speaker 5>lease.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

3715
02:52:01.251 --> 02:52:01.251
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to move back to New York.</v>

3716
02:52:01.251 --> 02:52:02.520
<v Speaker 5>I hated it out here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hated dealing with actors.</v>

3717
02:52:02.820 --> 02:52:05.630
<v Speaker 5>I'd never been around actors and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that,</v>

3718
02:52:05.631 --> 02:52:10.631
<v Speaker 5>that we were talking about before where </v>
<v Speaker 5>people just say things that they don't </v>

3719
02:52:10.631 --> 02:52:13.981
<v Speaker 5>really mean because they think that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to say those things </v>

3720
02:52:13.981 --> 02:52:14.260
<v Speaker 5>because there's like a pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior that you chose to.</v>

3721
02:52:14.520 --> 02:52:16.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought he was amazing in that film.</v>

3722
02:52:17.200 --> 02:52:19.300
<v Speaker 5>It was excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought he had a lot to offer.</v>

3723
02:52:20.110 --> 02:52:25.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean there was a lot of that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>nonsense out here where I was used to </v>

3724
02:52:25.110 --> 02:52:25.830
<v Speaker 5>real people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3725
02:52:26.410 --> 02:52:29.080
<v Speaker 5>for sure I was a flawed person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean for sure.</v>

3726
02:52:29.081 --> 02:52:34.081
<v Speaker 5>I was rough and I said I just wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't have good decorum.</v>

3727
02:52:35.170 --> 02:52:37.450
<v Speaker 5>Like the way I communicated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a rough guy,</v>

3728
02:52:37.870 --> 02:52:42.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd come from fighting and then went </v>

3729
02:52:42.870 --> 02:52:44.170
<v Speaker 5>right into standing up and this was only</v>
<v Speaker 5>a few years later I'm doing this now.</v>

3730
02:52:44.171 --> 02:52:48.310
<v Speaker 5>I had my last fight in 89,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so this is 94.</v>

3731
02:52:48.400 --> 02:52:52.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is just a few years after </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I was still very sketchy,</v>

3732
02:52:53.220 --> 02:52:54.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I didn't belong.</v>

3733
02:52:54.610 --> 02:52:57.010
<v Speaker 5>I felt like I didn't belong there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt like I couldn't be myself.</v>

3734
02:52:57.011 --> 02:52:59.560
<v Speaker 5>Everybody was like reading the Hollywood</v>
<v Speaker 5>reporter and variety,</v>

3735
02:52:59.610 --> 02:53:02.770
<v Speaker 5>unsettling the fuck you guys reading </v>
<v Speaker 5>this shit for like,</v>

3736
02:53:02.771 --> 02:53:03.430
<v Speaker 5>it's like this.</v>

3737
02:53:03.790 --> 02:53:08.790
<v Speaker 5>It was just the whole thing to me was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like this weird play that people were </v>

3738
02:53:08.790 --> 02:53:11.590
<v Speaker 5>putting on where everybody was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretend to be something so that they can</v>

3739
02:53:11.591 --> 02:53:16.591
<v Speaker 5>get auditions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I remember going on some auditions </v>

3740
02:53:16.591 --> 02:53:19.441
<v Speaker 5>and dealing with some of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>casting agents that had all this power </v>

3741
02:53:19.441 --> 02:53:24.031
<v Speaker 5>over you and they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they exhibited it like they exerted it </v>

3742
02:53:24.031 --> 02:53:27.840
<v Speaker 5>when you were in the room with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't communicate with you like </v>

3743
02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:30.340
<v Speaker 5>you're a person and I'm a person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They communicated with you like you want</v>

3744
02:53:30.341 --> 02:53:32.290
<v Speaker 5>something from me and I don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to give it to you.</v>

3745
02:53:32.380 --> 02:53:33.790
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me see what you do.</v>

3746
02:53:34.020 --> 02:53:36.430
<v Speaker 5>It was just the way they did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just so shitty.</v>

3747
02:53:37.150 --> 02:53:38.920
<v Speaker 5>It was just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was gross.</v>

3748
02:53:39.490 --> 02:53:40.830
<v Speaker 5>It was just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was fun.</v>

3749
02:53:41.050 --> 02:53:41.800
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's gross.</v>

3750
02:53:41.890 --> 02:53:44.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the thing that people have.</v>

3751
02:53:44.590 --> 02:53:45.850

<v Speaker 5>not just that the fact that he was a </v>

3753
02:53:51.040 --> 02:53:56.040
<v Speaker 5>piece of shit to all these women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's his position of power that he had </v>

3754
02:53:56.040 --> 02:53:59.641
<v Speaker 5>over them that he exerted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He got himself into this position and </v>

3755
02:53:59.641 --> 02:54:00.700
<v Speaker 5>then use that position to on some.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3756

<v Speaker 5>I don't want to hear this shit no more.</v>

3794
02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:32.360
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3795
02:55:32.390 --> 02:55:36.050
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like just the bullshit that these people</v>

3796
02:55:36.051 --> 02:55:41.051
<v Speaker 5>create in their worlds and you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you go to these casting things and </v>

3797
02:55:41.051 --> 02:55:43.910
<v Speaker 5>you see these things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see the fucking bullshit at out of a</v>

3798
02:55:43.911 --> 02:55:44.720
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3799
02:55:44.721 --> 02:55:47.930
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the reasons why people in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this town are so crazy.</v>

3800
02:55:47.931 --> 02:55:49.670
<v Speaker 5>It's because their insecurity to begin </v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

3801
02:55:49.671 --> 02:55:54.671
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only reason why anybody becomes an </v>

3802
02:55:54.671 --> 02:55:54.671
<v Speaker 5>actor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like why,</v>

3803
02:55:54.671 --> 02:55:56.270
<v Speaker 5>why people want to be famous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the only reason,</v>

3804
02:55:56.271 --> 02:56:01.271
<v Speaker 5>but one of the main reasons why people </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to be famous is because at some </v>

3805
02:56:01.271 --> 02:56:02.390
<v Speaker 5>point in their life they didn't feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>valuable.</v>

3806
02:56:02.510 --> 02:56:04.850
<v Speaker 5>At some point in their life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they felt discarded.</v>

3807
02:56:04.880 --> 02:56:09.880
<v Speaker 5>They felt abused,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they felt ignored and they had this </v>

3808
02:56:10.370 --> 02:56:13.010
<v Speaker 5>inescapable need for attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

3809
02:56:13.070 --> 02:56:18.070
<v Speaker 5>this whole that cannot be filled,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that was the driving force that led </v>

3810
02:56:18.411 --> 02:56:23.411
<v Speaker 5>them into acting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where would they could be on that stage </v>

3811
02:56:23.411 --> 02:56:26.141
<v Speaker 5>and everyone was looking at them all </v>
<v Speaker 5>eyes on them while the microphone was on</v>

3812
02:56:26.811 --> 02:56:31.811
<v Speaker 5>and the words were coming out of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>mouth and they were in the play or in </v>

3813
02:56:31.811 --> 02:56:35.111
<v Speaker 5>the movie or doing stand up even.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot of the same stuff that </v>

3814
02:56:35.111 --> 02:56:36.590
<v Speaker 5>propelled you and I being ignored as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>child,</v>

3815
02:56:36.620 --> 02:56:38.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like p feeling like you were nothing.</v>

3816
02:56:39.350 --> 02:56:41.960
<v Speaker 5>And then realizing that when you're on </v>
<v Speaker 5>stage man,</v>

3817
02:56:41.961 --> 02:56:45.320
<v Speaker 5>then your something like that person up </v>
<v Speaker 5>there with a spotlight on them,</v>

3818
02:56:45.500 --> 02:56:50.500
<v Speaker 5>that person's shining.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a something person that's not a </v>

3819
02:56:50.500 --> 02:56:54.851
<v Speaker 5>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that thing that leads you to become </v>

3820
02:56:54.851 --> 02:56:59.500
<v Speaker 5>an actor want to become famous is also </v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's,</v>

3821
02:56:59.660 --> 02:57:04.660
<v Speaker 5>it's so fucked up with acting because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to get chosen.</v>

3822
02:57:05.150 --> 02:57:09.070
<v Speaker 5>It's not like music or like stand up </v>
<v Speaker 5>where you can look at,</v>

3823
02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:14.080
<v Speaker 5>stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All you have to do as you do open mic </v>

3824
02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:14.080
<v Speaker 5>nights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get funny,</v>

3825
02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:14.340
<v Speaker 5>you build up an act in and people come </v>
<v Speaker 5>to see you.</v>

3826
02:57:14.660 --> 02:57:17.180
<v Speaker 5>You build up a career and the next thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you,</v>

3827
02:57:17.190 --> 02:57:19.670
<v Speaker 5>you become a successful comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what happened to you.</v>

3828
02:57:19.790 --> 02:57:21.620
<v Speaker 5>That's what happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but with acting,</v>

3829
02:57:21.621 --> 02:57:23.340
<v Speaker 5>you have to get chosen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't.</v>

3830
02:57:23.430 --> 02:57:25.880
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to work like if you do </v>
<v Speaker 5>plays,</v>

3831
02:57:25.881 --> 02:57:27.530
<v Speaker 5>nobody is ever going to fucking see you </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>

3832
02:57:27.620 --> 02:57:32.620
<v Speaker 5>You're never gonna make it out of place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's going to see famous play </v>

3833
02:57:32.620 --> 02:57:33.290
<v Speaker 5>actors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody gives a shit about them.</v>

3834
02:57:33.500 --> 02:57:35.900
<v Speaker 5>You have to be in movies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to be in television,</v>

3835
02:57:35.901 --> 02:57:40.901
<v Speaker 5>so you have to get chosen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you have this whole chain of like </v>

3836
02:57:40.901 --> 02:57:41.510
<v Speaker 5>June,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe I'll pick you,</v>

3837
02:57:41.540 --> 02:57:46.540
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not sure are you the one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you have to develop this sort of </v>

3838
02:57:46.540 --> 02:57:48.830
<v Speaker 5>personality that fits in with their what</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're looking for.</v>

3839
02:57:48.920 --> 02:57:52.070
<v Speaker 5>You have to mold your sensibilities and </v>
<v Speaker 5>your ideas.</v>

3840
02:57:52.220 --> 02:57:57.220
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot of people that are in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hollywood that don't have opinions of </v>

3841
02:57:57.220 --> 02:58:01.871
<v Speaker 5>their own.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What they have is a series of opinions </v>

3842
02:58:01.871 --> 02:58:01.980
<v Speaker 5>that they've adopted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>adapted</v>

3843
02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:05.100
<v Speaker 3>because they think it's going to lead </v>
<v Speaker 3>them to be successful.</v>

3844
02:58:05.580 --> 02:58:10.580
<v Speaker 3>Have they heard of star?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know how many times I go to an </v>
