00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of different things that people take to improve mental function</v>

84
00:02:07.751 --> 00:02:12.700
<v Speaker 1>and they just put the highest ingredients together and started a,</v>

85
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.563
<v Speaker 1>started selling it.</v>

86

<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

87
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.550
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating stuff man.</v>

88
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.941
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

89
00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:16.081
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

90
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:17.710
<v Speaker 1>the science of it is a little sketchy.</v>

91
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.150
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people call bullshit,</v>

92
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.040
<v Speaker 1>but I think it works.</v>

93
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.641
<v Speaker 1>Works for me,</v>

94
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:22.000
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

95
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's just a placebo effect.</v>

96
00:02:23.411 --> 00:02:26.020
<v Speaker 1>I'll take all the lies that you tell me if I believe them.</v>

97
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.310
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it works to me too.</v>

98
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.671
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

99
00:02:27.671 --> 00:02:29.780
<v Speaker 1>the dreams or no question you,</v>

100
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.370
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

101
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.980
<v Speaker 1>you take them,</v>

102
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.260
<v Speaker 1>you have this fucking,</v>

103
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.890
<v Speaker 1>these crazy vivid rememberable dreams.</v>

104
00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:36.940
<v Speaker 1>It's very unusual.</v>

105
00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:39.370
<v Speaker 1>And supposedly it's because of Coleen.</v>

106
00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Is that how you saying?</v>

107
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Is that the,</v>

108
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.380
<v Speaker 1>the nutrient,</v>

109
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I believe you said it's called Coleen,</v>

110
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>but apparently it's known to stimulate dreams.</v>

111
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.190
<v Speaker 1>It gives you fucking weird,</v>

112
00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:49.024
<v Speaker 1>creepy,</v>

113
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Speaker 1>memorable dreams.</v>

114
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I've got a weird dream of battle Werewolf and a gorilla having sex and I was</v>

115
00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:57.880
<v Speaker 1>trying to be quiet and get out of the room before they realized I was there</v>

116
00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.170
<v Speaker 1>because you,</v>

117
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>I was last night</v>

118
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.360
<v Speaker 3>I was laying in bed and I was looking up your books on Amazon and uh,</v>

119
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 3>the one cover he has is so trippy.</v>

120
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 3>I actually spent a good time just scrolling up and down on my browser.</v>

121
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:11.990
<v Speaker 3>Just looking at the code.</v>

122
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.980
<v Speaker 3>Which one?</v>

123
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 3>Over the head?</v>

124
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.310
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

125
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 3>And the one that has the mushroom in the middle and then it's just like,</v>

126
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 3>it was fucking awesome.</v>

127
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.101
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

128

130
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.660

131
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.580
<v Speaker 4>what if this really was going down?</v>

132
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.980
<v Speaker 4>Like right now in Los Angeles.</v>

133
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.761
<v Speaker 4>Are you prepared?</v>

134
00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:29.640
<v Speaker 4>Because I know you're a big 2012 advocate and I've talked to you about,</v>

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.890
<v Speaker 4>those crazy hippies yet really nutty ones,</v>

150
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.331
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

151
00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:48.721
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

00:03:48.721 --> 00:03:48.931
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

153
00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:49.160
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

154
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.993
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

155
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.970
<v Speaker 4>I like the whole scene.</v>

156
00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:51.091
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

157
00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:52.320
<v Speaker 4>it's all sorts of genius people.</v>

158
00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:54.080
<v Speaker 4>They're actually like a very,</v>

159
00:03:54.081 --> 00:03:54.390
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

160
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.970
<v Speaker 4>not just hippies but the heads of all the technology companies.</v>

161
00:03:56.971 --> 00:03:59.630
<v Speaker 4>I had to debate with them Google exact cause,</v>

162
00:03:59.631 --> 00:03:59.720
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

163
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.690
<v Speaker 4>he was a yoga practitioner and you know,</v>

164
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

165
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.530
<v Speaker 4>I have lots of great conversations where they are.</v>

166
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's all the,</v>

167
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

168
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.510
<v Speaker 4>the psychedelic community.</v>

169
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:08.760
<v Speaker 4>And I spent a lot of time with this woman who runs the women's visionary</v>

170
00:04:08.761 --> 00:04:13.050
<v Speaker 4>Congress and my friend John Perry Barlow who wrote lyrics for the grateful dead</v>

171
00:04:13.051 --> 00:04:15.390
<v Speaker 4>and it started electronic freedom foundation.</v>

172
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.530
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

173
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.700
<v Speaker 4>it's actually an amazing,</v>

174
00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:18.031
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

175
00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:18.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

176
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.700
<v Speaker 4>brain trust of,</v>

177
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.740
<v Speaker 4>of human oddities and eccentric fossils.</v>

178
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.730
<v Speaker 4>I believe that.</v>

179
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.970
<v Speaker 4>But there's also a lot of douchebags and you've got to wade through them.</v>

180
00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:27.870
<v Speaker 4>And when your,</v>

181
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.980
<v Speaker 4>what you are is like this figurehead for this psychedelic movement and sort of a</v>

182
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:32.700
<v Speaker 4>lot of ways.</v>

183
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.020
<v Speaker 4>So you must get a lot of crackpots.</v>

184
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.040
<v Speaker 4>And when I say Douche bags,</v>

185
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:35.700
<v Speaker 4>it's not their fault.</v>

186
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.830
<v Speaker 4>I didn't just say us a lot of it,</v>

187
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.683
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of crazy,</v>

188
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.000
<v Speaker 4>she didn't have one,</v>

189
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:40.530
<v Speaker 4>a douchebag experience and all every,</v>

190
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.890
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people did come up to you and whoever who was cool who would read my</v>

191
00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:48.020
<v Speaker 4>books or seen the film and people were extremely like respectful and I still</v>

192
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.631
<v Speaker 4>kind of like,</v>

193
00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:50.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm like moving like people tell me,</v>

194
00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:52.890
<v Speaker 4>people told me that the books had affected them or impacted their lives.</v>

195
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.070
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

196
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.361
<v Speaker 3>What I mean,</v>

197
00:04:53.361 --> 00:04:56.130
<v Speaker 3>every dead show I've ever been to or any fish show I've ever been,</v>

198
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 3>it was never been douche bag.</v>

199
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.110
<v Speaker 3>So I was think you would think that there'd be a shitload distract.</v>

200
00:05:00.111 --> 00:05:01.940
<v Speaker 3>Everyone has like this positive vibe to them.</v>

201
00:05:01.941 --> 00:05:02.510
<v Speaker 3>So everyone,</v>

202
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.650
<v Speaker 3>even if there are a douche bag,</v>

203
00:05:03.651 --> 00:05:05.030
<v Speaker 3>they still have like this underlining.</v>

204
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

205
00:05:05.331 --> 00:05:06.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a happy and in love.</v>

206
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.900
<v Speaker 3>I want to give you love and positive energy.</v>

207
00:05:08.901 --> 00:05:11.780
<v Speaker 3>It seems like the whole scene and stuff like so I just have a negative idea.</v>

208
00:05:11.781 --> 00:05:12.321
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

209
00:05:12.321 --> 00:05:14.450
<v Speaker 3>I think you're like carbon right now.</v>

210
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.430
<v Speaker 3>I lived in boulder for a walking,</v>

211
00:05:16.431 --> 00:05:17.790
<v Speaker 3>became very terrified of him.</v>

212
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.490
<v Speaker 3>You're very east coast.</v>

213
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.461
<v Speaker 4>Before.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was like so down with it and you're around them for wine like Todd.</v>

215
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.690
<v Speaker 4>So many people are fucking crazy.</v>

218
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean you look at the Republican convention,</v>

219
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.920

<v Speaker 4>so there's these,</v>

223
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.370
<v Speaker 4>these debates they're having,</v>

224
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.410
<v Speaker 4>it's like one nutty fucking person after nutty,</v>

227
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.450
<v Speaker 4>the guy from California with a guy from the Massachusetts rather mitten Romney.</v>

228
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:45.780

234
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.940
<v Speaker 4>the last words of,</v>

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.300
<v Speaker 1>At a certain point in time,</v>

241
00:06:03.301 --> 00:06:04.134
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

242

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.620
<v Speaker 1>how does a guy like that allowed to even run for president?</v>

244
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.793
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

245
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Is there certain things that you believe,</v>

246
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.990
<v Speaker 1>do you think that there should be a line that like someone completed signing go,</v>

247
00:06:13.991 --> 00:06:14.261
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

250
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.530
<v Speaker 1>It was very hard to draw that line at this point.</v>

251
00:06:17.531 --> 00:06:17.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

252
00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:18.300
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

253
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

254
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.320
<v Speaker 1>believing in the Bible and so on,</v>

255
00:06:20.321 --> 00:06:21.130
<v Speaker 1>it's hard enough.</v>

256
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.250
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>

257
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.720
<v Speaker 1>how about the 6,000 year people?</v>

258
00:06:22.721 --> 00:06:24.940
<v Speaker 1>The people that really believe the earth is 6,000 years old.</v>

259
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.863
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of them.</v>

260
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.063
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Palin,</v>

261
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.260
<v Speaker 1>she really believes that</v>

262
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.653
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people do.</v>

263
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.360
<v Speaker 3>I think you learned from that movie red state that that like everybody,</v>

264
00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:38.350
<v Speaker 3>there's a this big center of the world that's really crazy and like fucking,</v>

265
00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:40.090
<v Speaker 3>they believe crazy shit.</v>

266
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.081
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't,</v>

267
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:43.750
<v Speaker 3>even though I just watched that wild whites of West Virginia.</v>

268
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

269
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.201
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

270
00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:44.620
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

271
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.170
<v Speaker 3>those people believe probably things that you would be amazed.</v>

272
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that they're thinking about that.</v>

273
00:06:48.691 --> 00:06:49.590
<v Speaker 1>They're just pill people.</v>

274
00:06:49.591 --> 00:06:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Pill pop and people in partiers.</v>

275
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

276
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.210
<v Speaker 1>And you've seen that the wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia.</v>

277
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

278
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating yet terrifying documentary that Johnny Knoxville put together</v>

279
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.870
<v Speaker 1>about this family in West Virginia.</v>

280
00:07:00.871 --> 00:07:02.250
<v Speaker 1>That's completely crazy.</v>

281
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

282
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.530
<v Speaker 1>All there do.</v>

283
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Like they're just constantly committing crimes and selling pills and going on</v>

284
00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:11.040
<v Speaker 1>rampages and get arrested and just a fascinating family.</v>

285
00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:13.920
<v Speaker 1>That's just not living by the rules that you are.</v>

286
00:07:13.921 --> 00:07:14.754
<v Speaker 1>I live by,</v>

287
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

288
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 3>now Berston burning man was sold out this year and it's just like,</v>

289
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 3>I think the first time that it was ever sold out.</v>

290
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.900
<v Speaker 3>Did it seem like overly crowded or did it seem like,</v>

291
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 3>why did they even put a,</v>

292
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.193
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

293
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:27.850
<v Speaker 6>they don't have a control over that.</v>

294
00:07:27.851 --> 00:07:29.080
<v Speaker 6>It's the bureau of land management.</v>

295
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:29.710
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a,</v>

296
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.951
<v Speaker 6>actually,</v>

297
00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:31.270
<v Speaker 6>because it counts as a city.</v>

298
00:07:31.271 --> 00:07:32.270
<v Speaker 6>It's only allowed to go three Pr,</v>

299
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:32.590
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

300
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.150
<v Speaker 6>to grow 3% per year.</v>

301
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.480
<v Speaker 6>So it was growing from 51 to 54,000 or something like that.</v>

302
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.900
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

303
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.471
<v Speaker 6>Something like that.</v>

304
00:07:38.471 --> 00:07:38.801
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

305
00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:39.634
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

306
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:40.211
<v Speaker 6>so yeah,</v>

307
00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:43.300
<v Speaker 6>I mean he could easily go up to 75 or a hundred thousand in terms of the space</v>

308
00:07:43.301 --> 00:07:43.511
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

309
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:43.631
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

310
00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:43.991
<v Speaker 6>they just keep,</v>

311
00:07:43.991 --> 00:07:46.630
<v Speaker 6>they can just keep adding avenues and expanding it and so on.</v>

312
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.100
<v Speaker 6>Do you see any awesome art?</v>

313
00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:48.934
<v Speaker 6>Did you see any like,</v>

314
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:49.571
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

315
00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:51.520
<v Speaker 6>they took it to the next level type shit this year?</v>

316
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.300
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

317
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:52.571
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

318
00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:52.791
<v Speaker 6>there were,</v>

319
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:54.000
<v Speaker 6>so there was some beautiful stuff there.</v>

320
00:07:54.001 --> 00:07:56.110
<v Speaker 6>There was a huge model of the Trojan horse,</v>

321
00:07:56.111 --> 00:08:01.111
<v Speaker 6>which a 300 Greeks and white togas a drag for the gates and they blew it up in</v>

322
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:03.130
<v Speaker 6>spectacular fashion on Friday night.</v>

323
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:03.964
<v Speaker 6>There's lots of fun stuff.</v>

324
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.301
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

325
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:05.134
<v Speaker 6>that sounds pretty fun.</v>

326
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.500
<v Speaker 3>I want to go so bad.</v>

327
00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 3>Like I talked about it and maybe fit 20 podcasts ago.</v>

328
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.230
<v Speaker 3>Like I was thinking about going and I'm mad at myself for not going.</v>

329
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Perceptions are always just going to be some really cool people did,</v>

330
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:18.150
<v Speaker 1>but just going to wade through some knuckleheads to get to them.</v>

331
00:08:18.151 --> 00:08:20.010
<v Speaker 1>But you're sounding like it's not that way.</v>

332
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.780
<v Speaker 1>You're sounding like it's pretty positive overall.</v>

333
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:22.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

334
00:08:22.591 --> 00:08:23.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>

335
00:08:23.011 --> 00:08:23.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

336
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I still like it.</v>

337
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:24.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

338
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:25.610
<v Speaker 1>it's still not.</v>

339
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.443
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

340
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.190
<v Speaker 1>What if this is December 21st,</v>

341
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.320
<v Speaker 1>2012 is the the big day and that's,</v>

342
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:31.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

343
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:36.210
<v Speaker 1>etched in stone and a lot of people's ideas about a lot of the shit that you</v>

344
00:08:36.211 --> 00:08:39.990
<v Speaker 1>write about and a lot of the shit that people think of about the coming of the</v>

345
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.680
<v Speaker 1>next age.</v>

346
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.060
<v Speaker 1>If it rolls around and nothing happens,</v>

347
00:08:42.061 --> 00:08:42.690
<v Speaker 1>then what?</v>

348
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

349
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

350
00:08:43.531 --> 00:08:43.681
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

351
00:08:43.681 --> 00:08:43.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

352
00:08:43.831 --> 00:08:43.891
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

353
00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:44.321
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

354
00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:44.581
<v Speaker 1>we're actually,</v>

355
00:08:44.581 --> 00:08:47.160
<v Speaker 1>people would have to look at whatever I said and read about it because I never,</v>

356
00:08:47.161 --> 00:08:49.020
<v Speaker 1>I never particularly said that anything was going to happen.</v>

357
00:08:49.021 --> 00:08:49.854
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely true.</v>

358
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

359
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.133
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

360
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.080
<v Speaker 1>absolutely having that,</v>

361
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

362
00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:52.741
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

363
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:55.200
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that it's super clear that we're in</v>

364
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.370
<v Speaker 6>the middle of a transformation that,</v>

365
00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:58.711
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

366
00:08:58.711 --> 00:08:59.041
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

367
00:08:59.041 --> 00:08:59.311
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

368
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 6>we can see now the global economy is buckling.</v>

369
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.610
<v Speaker 6>The planetary ecology is also buckling.</v>

370
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:07.530
<v Speaker 6>We've re we've hit peak oil.</v>

371
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.370
<v Speaker 6>A lot of the resources are in a serious depletion.</v>

372
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.301
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

373
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:12.751
<v Speaker 6>so yeah,</v>

374
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:12.931
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>

375
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:13.141
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>

376
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:13.990
<v Speaker 6>we're faced with,</v>

377
00:09:13.991 --> 00:09:14.210
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

378
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.520
<v Speaker 6>with an end game for the,</v>

379
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 6>for the current global civilization that we're adding.</v>

380
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 6>Is that peak oil thing been clearly established?</v>

381
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.851
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

382
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:22.200
<v Speaker 6>it's been very clearly established.</v>

383
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:24.270
<v Speaker 6>So everyone agrees it's not a debated thing.</v>

384
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:24.481
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

385
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:24.661
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

386
00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:25.261
<v Speaker 6>of course there's,</v>

387
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:25.471
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

388
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:27.540
<v Speaker 6>there's some debate and there's some misinformation.</v>

389
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of,</v>

390
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.130
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of money involved,</v>

391
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:29.281
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

392
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:30.114
<v Speaker 6>but if you look at what,</v>

393
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.361
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

394
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:30.471
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

395
00:09:30.471 --> 00:09:30.670
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

396
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.720
<v Speaker 6>the main geologists talk about,</v>

397
00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:34.021
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

398
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:34.201
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

399
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:36.170
<v Speaker 6>it's prediction that was made back in the 70s.</v>

400
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.410
<v Speaker 6>That's why they're trying to get all this oil in Canada.</v>

401
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.950
<v Speaker 6>There's big protests had been happening on the White House lawn where Daryl</v>

402
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:44.701
<v Speaker 6>Hannah got arrested.</v>

403
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 6>One of the NASA's top climate scientists get arrested and they're protesting</v>

404
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 6>this extraction,</v>

405
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:53.490
<v Speaker 6>which is apparently incredibly inefficient.</v>

406
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:53.551
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

407
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:53.911
<v Speaker 6>of course.</v>

408
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:54.590
<v Speaker 6>But it's why we are,</v>

409
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.991
<v Speaker 6>we are,</v>

410
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:55.381
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

411
00:09:55.381 --> 00:09:56.340
<v Speaker 6>in wars and,</v>

412
00:09:56.341 --> 00:09:56.581
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

413
00:09:56.581 --> 00:09:56.940
<v Speaker 6>Libya,</v>

414
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.710
<v Speaker 6>Afghanistan and Iraq and you know,</v>

415
00:09:58.711 --> 00:09:59.970
<v Speaker 6>why we're trying to hold down the,</v>

416
00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:00.211
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

417
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:00.341
<v Speaker 6>our,</v>

418
00:10:00.341 --> 00:10:01.310
<v Speaker 6>our access to the,</v>

419
00:10:01.311 --> 00:10:02.640
<v Speaker 6>to the remaining resources,</v>

420
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.493
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

421
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.110
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

422
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.441
<v Speaker 6>but yeah,</v>

423
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:04.681
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

424
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:05.101
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

425
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:05.370
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

426
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.720
<v Speaker 6>I never represent anticipated than anything exactly what happened on December</v>

427
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:09.720
<v Speaker 6>21st,</v>

428
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.950
<v Speaker 6>2012 although it certainly might.</v>

429
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:11.551
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

430
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:12.390
<v Speaker 6>but I think that,</v>

431
00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:12.571
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

432
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:12.931
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

433
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

434
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.380
<v Speaker 6>what we need to do and when I tried to do and in my work up to this point is</v>

435
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:20.400
<v Speaker 6>really tried to take a big step back and look at our situation.</v>

436
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.250
<v Speaker 6>And factory in all sorts of stuff that,</v>

437
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:23.940
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

438
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.940
<v Speaker 6>the modern worldview was not really factoring in,</v>

439
00:10:26.941 --> 00:10:29.730
<v Speaker 6>which for me includes Shamanism,</v>

440
00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:29.971
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

441
00:10:29.971 --> 00:10:31.650
<v Speaker 6>the DMT experience,</v>

442
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.600
<v Speaker 6>psychic experience in general.</v>

443
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:33.840
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

444
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.051
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

445
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:37.730
<v Speaker 6>the kind of psychic capacities that actually many people are aware of that</v>

446
00:10:37.731 --> 00:10:38.580
<v Speaker 6>happen all the time,</v>

447
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 6>whether it's synchronicity or tube top of thing.</v>

448
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:42.240
<v Speaker 6>And so we were on the phone today.</v>

449
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:43.240
<v Speaker 6>We talked to,</v>

450
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.100
<v Speaker 6>I talked to you about it.</v>

451
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.630
<v Speaker 6>Like I was picking up your,</v>

452
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.950
<v Speaker 6>I picked up my phone and I was going through the contacts to find your number</v>

453
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.780
<v Speaker 6>and the phone rang and it was you.</v>

454
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.703
<v Speaker 6>I love that shit.</v>

455
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:53.611
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

456
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.200
<v Speaker 6>that's as creepy as it gets.</v>

457
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:55.831
<v Speaker 6>What are the,</v>

458
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:56.910
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of minutes in a day,</v>

459
00:10:56.911 --> 00:10:57.570
<v Speaker 6>more and more.</v>

460
00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:57.930
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

461
00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 6>How do you know what I'm calling you,</v>

462
00:10:58.921 --> 00:10:59.071
<v Speaker 6>man?</v>

463
00:10:59.071 --> 00:11:00.390
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of God demands in the day.</v>

464
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:01.620
<v Speaker 6>When was the last time I fucking called you?</v>

465
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:02.071
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

466
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:02.281
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

467
00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:03.960
<v Speaker 6>you were supposed to be on the podcast,</v>

468
00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:04.201
<v Speaker 6>the name.</v>

469
00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:05.610
<v Speaker 6>We had emailed each other about it,</v>

470
00:11:05.611 --> 00:11:07.860
<v Speaker 6>but we hadn't talked on the phone a long ass time.</v>

471
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.150
<v Speaker 6>That's a weird coincidence.</v>

472
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.021
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

473
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:10.141
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

474
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:10.370
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

475
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:10.481
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

476
00:11:10.481 --> 00:11:12.270
<v Speaker 6>you think you could say that it's weird and creepy,</v>

477
00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:15.000
<v Speaker 6>but then you kind of get past that point and you just kind of integrate it and</v>

478
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:15.241
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

479
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:15.511
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

480
00:11:15.511 --> 00:11:15.991
<v Speaker 6>there's somehow,</v>

481
00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:20.580
<v Speaker 6>there's actually no one consciousness that's kind of working through all of us.</v>

482
00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:20.731
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

483
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:20.981
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

484
00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:21.390
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

485
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:21.631
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

486
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:24.210
<v Speaker 6>as time moves on in this period,</v>

487
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:26.550
<v Speaker 6>it seems like those synchronicities are speeding up and our,</v>

488
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:30.060
<v Speaker 6>and our psychic capacities are somehow and intensifying,</v>

489
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.080
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

490
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:31.340
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

491
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.430
<v Speaker 6>but I will say that my one idea I'm working on for December 21st,</v>

492
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.180
<v Speaker 6>2012 is to utilize the date because now there's so much popular focus on it to</v>

493
00:11:39.181 --> 00:11:41.190
<v Speaker 6>create a kind of global events,</v>

494
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.900
<v Speaker 6>which would be a kind of spectacle.</v>

495
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm working with the composers and a team from Cirque du Solei and they're kind</v>

496
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:51.630
<v Speaker 6>of putting together a concept for a show that would kind of celebrate humans</v>

497
00:11:51.631 --> 00:11:52.500
<v Speaker 6>evolution,</v>

498
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.060
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

499
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.620
<v Speaker 6>mentees evolution to this present point and then ending with a synchronized,</v>

500
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.473
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

501
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:02.890
<v Speaker 6>peace meditation kind of global focus on unity with the idea that you could,</v>

502
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:03.730
<v Speaker 6>you could take that,</v>

503
00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:07.660
<v Speaker 6>the energy for that that's pointed towards that day and there's so much fear</v>

504
00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Speaker 6>around that and anxiety and trepidation and actually make it into like the most</v>

505
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:12.640
<v Speaker 6>awesome thing possible where it's like,</v>

506
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:12.791
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

507
00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:17.260
<v Speaker 6>look where we've arrived at and look at our opportunities now to make a shift</v>

508
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:20.650
<v Speaker 6>and a jump into a new form of planetary civilization.</v>

509
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

510
00:12:20.871 --> 00:12:21.560
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>

511
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

512
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.040
<v Speaker 1>the clearest time in human history where the common person,</v>

513
00:12:25.041 --> 00:12:28.940
<v Speaker 1>any person really has a direct influence over an incredible amount of people</v>

514
00:12:28.941 --> 00:12:30.230
<v Speaker 1>with viral information,</v>

515
00:12:30.231 --> 00:12:33.380
<v Speaker 1>with videos and with anything that you ride that really resonates with people.</v>

516
00:12:33.381 --> 00:12:35.840
<v Speaker 1>You can hit an amazing amount of people now.</v>

517
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:39.170
<v Speaker 1>So a guy like you could get in touch with a bunch of other people who could do</v>

518
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.490
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same thing.</v>

519
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.300
<v Speaker 1>And a ripple effect can go on and it can hit millions and millions easy.</v>

520
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.760
<v Speaker 1>There's never been an opportunity to do anything like that.</v>

521
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.080
<v Speaker 4>Got,</v>

522
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.680
<v Speaker 4>we totally love to have you involved with our unified earth.</v>

523
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:50.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm not too sure.</v>

524
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:52.200
<v Speaker 4>Let's do see real sure.</v>

525
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.670
<v Speaker 4>Start to say I'm down.</v>

526
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:54.241
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

527
00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:55.800
<v Speaker 4>we're actually working at,</v>

528
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:57.151
<v Speaker 4>at the moment,</v>

529
00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:57.571
<v Speaker 4>at the moment,</v>

530
00:12:57.571 --> 00:12:57.990
<v Speaker 4>we're actually in</v>

531
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.260
<v Speaker 6>negotiation with the Mexican government to use a Chichen Itza,</v>

532
00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:01.261
<v Speaker 6>Chichen Itza,</v>

533
00:13:01.261 --> 00:13:04.140
<v Speaker 6>which is considered by the Mayans to be the heart of the Mayan world.</v>

534
00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:04.370
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

535
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.460
<v Speaker 6>it would be the shit dude,</v>

536
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.950
<v Speaker 4>a Toby Keith concert at cheats in Eatsa gotta be the most ironic thing of all</v>

537
00:13:09.951 --> 00:13:10.784
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

538
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.180
<v Speaker 4>So he keeps his like this super raw,</v>

539
00:13:14.181 --> 00:13:15.770
<v Speaker 4>raw American country music.</v>

540
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.920
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

541
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.540
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>

542
00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna kick your ass.</v>

543
00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:18.711
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

544
00:13:18.711 --> 00:13:19.700
<v Speaker 4>He's like one of those guys.</v>

545
00:13:19.701 --> 00:13:20.060
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

546
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:20.810
<v Speaker 4>but he's kind of,</v>

547
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:21.621
<v Speaker 4>he's a good singer.</v>

548
00:13:21.621 --> 00:13:22.101
<v Speaker 4>I mean his,</v>

549
00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:23.240
<v Speaker 4>he's got good songs,</v>

550
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.141
<v Speaker 4>but there are just,</v>

551
00:13:24.141 --> 00:13:26.930
<v Speaker 4>some of them are like real knucklehead Rah Rah Rah songs.</v>

552
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.040
<v Speaker 4>I just think him on the fucking pyramids play in a concert might be one of the</v>

553
00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:32.540
<v Speaker 4>most ironic things of all time.</v>

554
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.791
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

555
00:13:34.791 --> 00:13:35.211
<v Speaker 4>awesome.</v>

556
00:13:35.211 --> 00:13:36.044
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>

557
00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.030
<v Speaker 4>You can love it or leave it.</v>

558
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.980
<v Speaker 4>He had a good song about smoking weed with Willie Nelson though.</v>

559
00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.260
<v Speaker 4>He's got good music.</v>

560
00:13:42.261 --> 00:13:42.891
<v Speaker 4>He's got a good music.</v>

561
00:13:42.891 --> 00:13:43.870
<v Speaker 4>I just think it would be funny.</v>

562
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.041
<v Speaker 4>Be Funny.</v>

563
00:13:46.041 --> 00:13:46.191
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

564
00:13:46.191 --> 00:13:46.771
<v Speaker 4>I'm scared to teach.</v>

565
00:13:46.771 --> 00:13:47.390
<v Speaker 4>Teacher need to know.</v>

566
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.390
<v Speaker 4>Don't ever get a Mexican dream right.</v>

567
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:50.420
<v Speaker 4>That dream down right now.</v>

568
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.620
<v Speaker 4>It's on the Internet.</v>

569
00:13:51.621 --> 00:13:53.420
<v Speaker 4>Now we can draw this dream for you.</v>

570
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.351
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

571
00:13:54.351 --> 00:13:54.891
<v Speaker 4>I should bullshit.</v>

572
00:13:54.891 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 4>Never stopped dreaming going never stop to the eye.</v>

573
00:13:57.311 --> 00:13:58.144
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

574
00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.570
<v Speaker 1>as as you do that things are moving in a certain direction and I wonder how much</v>

575
00:14:02.571 --> 00:14:03.291
<v Speaker 1>people steer it.</v>

576
00:14:03.291 --> 00:14:05.170
<v Speaker 1>You know how much things like this steer,</v>

577
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:09.380
<v Speaker 1>how much communication online steers it because it seems to me this is the only</v>

578
00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:14.381
<v Speaker 1>time where people have been able to sort of like merge in this way globally on</v>

579
00:14:15.111 --> 00:14:16.910
<v Speaker 1>their own and do it on a regular basis.</v>

580
00:14:16.911 --> 00:14:17.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

581
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.070
<v Speaker 1>people are addicted to just going on Twitter,</v>

582
00:14:19.071 --> 00:14:23.270
<v Speaker 1>addicted to communicating with people on message boards and on Facebook and</v>

583
00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:23.781
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

584
00:14:23.781 --> 00:14:23.991
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

585
00:14:23.991 --> 00:14:24.201
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

586
00:14:24.201 --> 00:14:24.471
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

587
00:14:24.471 --> 00:14:24.681
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

588
00:14:24.681 --> 00:14:27.110
<v Speaker 1>there's an inner connectivity that's never existed before.</v>

589
00:14:27.111 --> 00:14:32.111
<v Speaker 1>So an idea that the idea of a hive mind like influenced by anyone is way</v>

590
00:14:32.631 --> 00:14:35.330
<v Speaker 1>different now than it's ever been in human history as far as we know,</v>

591
00:14:35.331 --> 00:14:35.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

592
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:36.381
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

593
00:14:36.381 --> 00:14:36.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

594
00:14:36.561 --> 00:14:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Amazing Time,</v>

595
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

596
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:37.651
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

597
00:14:37.651 --> 00:14:37.921
<v Speaker 6>for sure.</v>

598
00:14:37.921 --> 00:14:39.860
<v Speaker 6>I mean now one idea that a lot of um,</v>

599
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.620
<v Speaker 6>different people are kind of moving towards this idea that maybe humanities on</v>

600
00:14:43.621 --> 00:14:46.590
<v Speaker 6>the verb of transition on the verge of transitioning into being kind of like a</v>

601
00:14:46.591 --> 00:14:47.730
<v Speaker 6>super organism.</v>

602
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:48.391
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

603
00:14:48.391 --> 00:14:52.970
<v Speaker 6>that we're kind of like coming to awareness of ourselves as a being in a</v>

604
00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:53.421
<v Speaker 6>sentence,</v>

605
00:14:53.421 --> 00:14:53.631
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

606
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 6>and then we can,</v>

607
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.400
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

608
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.210
<v Speaker 6>begin to act more symbiotically rather than like parasitically or aggressively.</v>

609
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:03.450
<v Speaker 1>There was a really fascinating article recently written on creativity and how</v>

610
00:15:03.451 --> 00:15:07.230
<v Speaker 1>people are always praising creativity and looking forward to getting new and</v>

611
00:15:07.231 --> 00:15:08.064
<v Speaker 1>creative ideas,</v>

612
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.000
<v Speaker 1>but that other people's creativity actually makes people uncomfortable.</v>

613
00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.310
<v Speaker 1>It makes people uncomfortable and uneasy.</v>

614
00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.490
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that someone had come up with these ideas that they didn't,</v>

615
00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:18.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

616
00:15:18.241 --> 00:15:19.074
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

617
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.251
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

618
00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:22.080
<v Speaker 1>you wonder if like the,</v>

619
00:15:22.081 --> 00:15:25.680
<v Speaker 1>the really powerful push towards fundamentalism,</v>

620
00:15:25.681 --> 00:15:29.580
<v Speaker 1>the really powerful push towards a 6,000 year old earth kind of Shit,</v>

621
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

622
00:15:30.181 --> 00:15:35.181
<v Speaker 1>and follow the Bible kind of Shit is really the same thing as someone trying to</v>

623
00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.050
<v Speaker 1>confined creativity.</v>

624
00:15:37.051 --> 00:15:39.340
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to confine enlightenment will say reasonable.</v>

625
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.370
<v Speaker 6>I guess my feeling is basically,</v>

626
00:15:41.371 --> 00:15:41.641
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

627
00:15:41.641 --> 00:15:41.990
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

628
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.910
<v Speaker 6>we live in a culture where there's,</v>

629
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.400
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

630
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:44.581
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

631
00:15:44.581 --> 00:15:45.414
<v Speaker 6>basically they're being,</v>

632
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.240
<v Speaker 6>people are being indoctrinated not to think they're being,</v>

633
00:15:48.241 --> 00:15:50.260
<v Speaker 6>they're being indoctrinated by the,</v>

634
00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:51.060
<v Speaker 6>the media,</v>

635
00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.510
<v Speaker 6>the mainstream culture by the education system to be ignorant,</v>

636
00:15:54.511 --> 00:15:55.470
<v Speaker 6>to not question,</v>

637
00:15:55.471 --> 00:15:58.620
<v Speaker 6>to not develop their independent capacity of thoughts.</v>

638
00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.261
<v Speaker 1>Are you okay,</v>

639
00:15:59.261 --> 00:16:03.130
<v Speaker 1>but you saying this as an from the education system or he's saying this from the</v>

640
00:16:03.131 --> 00:16:03.820
<v Speaker 1>media?</v>

641
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

642
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:04.121
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

643
00:16:04.121 --> 00:16:04.571
<v Speaker 1>From both,</v>

644
00:16:04.571 --> 00:16:05.404
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

645
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.300
<v Speaker 1>But the media does not make you dumb,</v>

646
00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:07.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

647
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes it does.</v>

648
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Does it mean it makes people incredibly skewed,</v>

649
00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:11.360
<v Speaker 1>makes you dumb.</v>

650
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.540
<v Speaker 1>You can't watch CNN.</v>

651
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch that stuff.</v>

652
00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:15.761
<v Speaker 1>But mean if you,</v>

653
00:16:15.761 --> 00:16:16.870
<v Speaker 1>did you think it would affect you?</v>

654
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.071
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

655
00:16:17.071 --> 00:16:19.620
<v Speaker 6>but if I'm in a hotel room and I watched that stuff for a couple of days,</v>

656
00:16:19.621 --> 00:16:20.720
<v Speaker 6>I feel like I'm having a lobotomy.</v>

657
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.400
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

658
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

659
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Just CNN or you can just see it as a program.</v>

660
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:26.461
<v Speaker 6>Things are,</v>

661
00:16:26.461 --> 00:16:27.190
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

662
00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:27.580
<v Speaker 6>from my,</v>

663
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.690
<v Speaker 6>from my perspective,</v>

664
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.280
<v Speaker 6>they're basically,</v>

665
00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:33.460
<v Speaker 6>I'm kind of holding the mass consciousness,</v>

666
00:16:33.461 --> 00:16:37.590
<v Speaker 6>the planetary consciousness at a certain low level or low frequency where it's</v>

667
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.990
<v Speaker 6>passive consumerist fear based.</v>

668
00:16:40.991 --> 00:16:41.141
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

669
00:16:41.141 --> 00:16:42.580
<v Speaker 6>there's this violent activity,</v>

670
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:43.930
<v Speaker 6>very disjointed.</v>

671
00:16:43.931 --> 00:16:45.640
<v Speaker 6>It creates a lot of frustration and anxiety.</v>

672
00:16:45.641 --> 00:16:47.740
<v Speaker 6>There's no deeper analysis.</v>

673
00:16:47.741 --> 00:16:49.620
<v Speaker 6>There's no attempt to create like a coherence,</v>

674
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:50.440
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

675
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.210
<v Speaker 6>understanding of what's happening.</v>

676
00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:52.830
<v Speaker 6>And Yeah,</v>

677
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I could see your point.</v>

678
00:16:53.791 --> 00:16:58.791
<v Speaker 1>That may be perhaps it isn't used to its utmost abilities or the capabilities</v>

679
00:16:58.861 --> 00:16:59.641
<v Speaker 1>that we would have for it.</v>

680
00:16:59.641 --> 00:17:00.890
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that it's,</v>

681
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.170
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good form of entertainment.</v>

682
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:04.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

683
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it has to be either or.</v>

684
00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you could sit home and watch a fucking silly TV show and it doesn't</v>

685
00:17:10.801 --> 00:17:11.634
<v Speaker 1>hurt you.</v>

686
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:11.911
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

687
00:17:11.911 --> 00:17:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I think this idea that we're helpless to media constantly bombarding us with</v>

688
00:17:16.681 --> 00:17:18.690
<v Speaker 1>these images and ideals and that we,</v>

689
00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.250
<v Speaker 1>we have to accept them.</v>

690
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I think that's silly.</v>

691
00:17:21.961 --> 00:17:23.340
<v Speaker 1>And I think that honestly,</v>

692
00:17:23.341 --> 00:17:24.151
<v Speaker 1>with the Internet,</v>

693
00:17:24.151 --> 00:17:27.170
<v Speaker 1>with you look at the society that's growing out at the Internet,</v>

694
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.070
<v Speaker 1>look at like movements like anonymous,</v>

695
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.420
<v Speaker 1>look at Shit like this.</v>

696
00:17:30.421 --> 00:17:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Things that have never happened before,</v>

697
00:17:31.711 --> 00:17:35.310
<v Speaker 1>these giant groups moving forward.</v>

698
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:35.981
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

699
00:17:35.981 --> 00:17:36.211
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

700
00:17:36.211 --> 00:17:36.351
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

701
00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:41.351
<v Speaker 1>and taking down websites and taking down companies that they feel have acted in</v>

702
00:17:42.181 --> 00:17:42.890
<v Speaker 1>justly.</v>

703
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:43.501
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have,</v>

704
00:17:43.501 --> 00:17:45.630
<v Speaker 1>no one's ever been able to do something like that before.</v>

705
00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:46.560
<v Speaker 1>And he at Stevie,</v>

706
00:17:46.561 --> 00:17:47.100
<v Speaker 1>if you want it,</v>

707
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:47.191
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

708
00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:48.180
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have some coffee.</v>

709
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

710
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

711
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.321
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

712
00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:49.471
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

713
00:17:49.471 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

714
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

715
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.220
<v Speaker 6>so we have two things that will be,</v>

716
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:52.800
<v Speaker 6>a number of things are happening simultaneously.</v>

717
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:55.830
<v Speaker 6>And that's another thing that's very interesting about our time is that things</v>

718
00:17:55.831 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 6>are getting pretty complicated right now.</v>

719
00:17:57.451 --> 00:18:01.050
<v Speaker 6>One problem with television in general is that it's designed to reduce</v>

720
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:02.850
<v Speaker 6>everything into tiny little soundbites.</v>

721
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:03.181
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

722
00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:03.340
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>

723
00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:08.010
<v Speaker 6>when Lincoln and Jefferson debated and the 1860s the debates lasted eight hours.</v>

724
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.640
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

725
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.870
<v Speaker 6>when we have a debate on TV,</v>

726
00:18:09.871 --> 00:18:12.990
<v Speaker 6>each person gets like 36 seconds for this response.</v>

727
00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:17.460
<v Speaker 6>23 [inaudible] were basically used to everything being spoonfed and dumbed down</v>

728
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.500
<v Speaker 6>to an absolute level of stupidity,</v>

729
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:20.041
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

730
00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:23.220
<v Speaker 6>And basically the problem is that because our scenario on the planet is very</v>

731
00:18:23.221 --> 00:18:24.450
<v Speaker 6>complex at this point,</v>

732
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.550
<v Speaker 6>we actually need to be able to,</v>

733
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:27.030
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

734
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.400
<v Speaker 6>articulate and analyze at a much deeper level,</v>

735
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:29.760
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

736
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.151
<v Speaker 6>So yes,</v>

737
00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:31.080
<v Speaker 6>we have two things going on.</v>

738
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.360
<v Speaker 6>We have the one directional mass media,</v>

739
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:38.510
<v Speaker 6>which I really am convinced is basically a kind of a la bottomy machine that</v>

740
00:18:39.241 --> 00:18:43.380
<v Speaker 6>anesthetize people into an ultimate state of idiocy and consumers passivity.</v>

741
00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:47.100
<v Speaker 6>And then we have the development of this new interactive media,</v>

742
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.490
<v Speaker 6>which is having profound effects and will continue to have profound effects.</v>

743
00:18:50.491 --> 00:18:51.680
<v Speaker 6>And if you go look at the history of the,</v>

744
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.553
<v Speaker 6>of media,</v>

745
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.130
<v Speaker 6>every time there's a new form of media that's very powerful,</v>

746
00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.630
<v Speaker 6>it transforms,</v>

747
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:58.281
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

748
00:18:58.281 --> 00:18:58.461
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

749
00:18:58.461 --> 00:18:58.660
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

750
00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:59.491
<v Speaker 6>the society,</v>

751
00:18:59.491 --> 00:19:00.690
<v Speaker 6>the political system,</v>

752
00:19:00.691 --> 00:19:02.040
<v Speaker 6>the government changes,</v>

753
00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:02.874
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>

754
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.061
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

755
00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:06.300
<v Speaker 6>you could never ever had an empire until you had a written code of laws that</v>

756
00:19:06.301 --> 00:19:08.850
<v Speaker 6>could be distributed to the borders and beyond.</v>

757
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:10.230
<v Speaker 6>You could never have had a,</v>

758
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.410
<v Speaker 6>a modern representational democracy,</v>

759
00:19:13.411 --> 00:19:13.591
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

760
00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:16.230
<v Speaker 6>nation state unless you had the printing press,</v>

761
00:19:16.231 --> 00:19:17.640
<v Speaker 6>which distributed enough,</v>

762
00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:18.360
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

763
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.400
<v Speaker 6>materials that everybody could participate in.</v>

764
00:19:20.401 --> 00:19:21.420
<v Speaker 6>Civic dialogues.</v>

765
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.150
<v Speaker 6>Now with this interactive technology potentially points towards a much deeper or</v>

766
00:19:26.151 --> 00:19:28.530
<v Speaker 6>transition in our political and social paradigm,</v>

767
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:29.130
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

768
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:34.130
<v Speaker 6>potentially towards a away from centralized control hierarchy to more of a kind</v>

769
00:19:34.501 --> 00:19:37.020
<v Speaker 6>of a distributed or direct democracy</v>

770
00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.530
<v Speaker 4>and interconnectedness as human beings in general.</v>

771
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:40.640
<v Speaker 4>It's never,</v>

772
00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.960
<v Speaker 4>no one's been this close to this many people just through online communication.</v>

773
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.350
<v Speaker 4>No one has ever had that kind of an influence before by such a wide variety of</v>

774
00:19:48.351 --> 00:19:49.430
<v Speaker 4>people and ideas,</v>

775
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.941
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

776
00:19:49.941 --> 00:19:51.000
<v Speaker 4>all come and watch,</v>

777
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:52.830
<v Speaker 6>look how incredibly knew it as.</v>

778
00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:52.970
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

779
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:53.170
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>

780
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.070
<v Speaker 6>we're just adapting.</v>

781
00:19:54.071 --> 00:19:54.371
<v Speaker 6>We're just,</v>

782
00:19:54.371 --> 00:19:54.731
<v Speaker 6>we're just,</v>

783
00:19:54.731 --> 00:19:56.290
<v Speaker 6>we're just like treading water trying to,</v>

784
00:19:56.291 --> 00:19:57.370
<v Speaker 6>trying to catch up with the,</v>

785
00:19:57.371 --> 00:19:58.270
<v Speaker 6>with this forest that,</v>

786
00:19:58.271 --> 00:19:58.451
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

787
00:19:58.451 --> 00:19:59.530
<v Speaker 6>that our culture has a,</v>

788
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.061
<v Speaker 6>has unleashed,</v>

789
00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:00.390
<v Speaker 6>unleashed</v>

790
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.901
<v Speaker 4>and it's good.</v>

791
00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:01.560
<v Speaker 4>Or is it no,</v>

792
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.520
<v Speaker 4>or is it also just,</v>

793
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.450
<v Speaker 4>is it as awesome?</v>

794
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:03.811
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

795
00:20:03.811 --> 00:20:04.561
<v Speaker 4>if you love change,</v>

796
00:20:04.561 --> 00:20:04.981
<v Speaker 4>it's great.</v>

797
00:20:04.981 --> 00:20:06.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you're somebody who had this,</v>

798
00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:07.200
<v Speaker 4>you know Warner records,</v>

799
00:20:07.201 --> 00:20:08.490
<v Speaker 4>you're probably scratching your head at this point.</v>

800
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.140
<v Speaker 4>The most fascinating conversation.</v>

801
00:20:10.141 --> 00:20:10.261
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

802
00:20:10.261 --> 00:20:10.800
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

803
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.170
<v Speaker 4>I had the most fascinating conversation with a guy who was trying to say that</v>

804
00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:15.600
<v Speaker 4>Google is bad and the idea of the Internet search is bad.</v>

805
00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:16.081
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

806
00:20:16.081 --> 00:20:16.500
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

807
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:16.801
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

808
00:20:16.801 --> 00:20:17.630
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>

809
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.020
<v Speaker 4>it used to be if you wanted knowledge,</v>

810
00:20:19.021 --> 00:20:20.040
<v Speaker 4>I had to go look for it.</v>

811
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:20.851
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

812
00:20:20.851 --> 00:20:21.121
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

813
00:20:21.121 --> 00:20:23.510
<v Speaker 4>that might be the craziest fucking thing I've ever heard.</v>

814
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.190
<v Speaker 4>You think it should be hard to find that shit and she'd be hard.</v>

815
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.500
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to go to a library and look up the right bug.</v>

816
00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:29.310
<v Speaker 4>It should take hours.</v>

817
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.521
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

818
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:30.950
<v Speaker 4>you should be able to save your phone.</v>

819
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.280
<v Speaker 4>That's very much like people would talk about,</v>

820
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:32.730
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

821
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:33.930
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't take a psychedelic cause.</v>

822
00:20:33.931 --> 00:20:37.200
<v Speaker 4>It's like a shortcut to the mystical experience and of course the answer to that</v>

823
00:20:37.201 --> 00:20:37.520
<v Speaker 4>is like,</v>

824
00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.720
<v Speaker 4>you know what's right with a shortcut.</v>

825
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:39.930
<v Speaker 4>If I'm trying to get somewhere,</v>

826
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.250
<v Speaker 4>am I going to go like all around like a circuitous barring route or am I gonna</v>

827
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.610
<v Speaker 4>just take the frigging shortcut?</v>

828
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.000
<v Speaker 4>That reminds me of a joke.</v>

829
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 4>Terence Mckenna used</v>

830
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.000
<v Speaker 1>to say that,</v>

831
00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:49.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

832
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.830
<v Speaker 1>some guy practice a city of levitation for 40 years and figured out,</v>

833
00:20:53.831 --> 00:20:56.530
<v Speaker 1>finally had a float and he came up to the Buddha and he said,</v>

834
00:20:56.531 --> 00:20:56.951
<v Speaker 1>master,</v>

835
00:20:56.951 --> 00:20:58.420
<v Speaker 1>I can walk across the water.</v>

836
00:20:59.080 --> 00:20:59.801
<v Speaker 1>And the Buddhist said,</v>

837
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.060
<v Speaker 1>but the fairies only a nickel,</v>

838
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:04.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

839
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

840
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:05.800
<v Speaker 1>take the fucking mushroom,</v>

841
00:21:05.801 --> 00:21:06.341
<v Speaker 1>take a chance,</v>

842
00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:06.670
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

843
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Take a take a shortcut.</v>

844
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.561
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

845
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:13.561
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you are independent from nature and then you don't need some help</v>

846
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:18.100
<v Speaker 1>in any way mean you're constantly getting help from nutrients and vitamins and</v>

847
00:21:18.101 --> 00:21:20.230
<v Speaker 1>protein and all these different things he absorbed through nature.</v>

848
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.200
<v Speaker 1>But then when it comes to this that you think may or may not do something to</v>

849
00:21:23.201 --> 00:21:23.681
<v Speaker 1>your mind,</v>

850
00:21:23.681 --> 00:21:24.010
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

851
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:24.640
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

852
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.230
<v Speaker 1>I can get there naturally</v>

853
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.870
<v Speaker 6>back to the Google search.</v>

854
00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:29.021
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

855
00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:29.171
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

856
00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:29.321
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

857
00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:29.951
<v Speaker 6>I think fat,</v>

858
00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:30.700
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

859
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:30.941
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

860
00:21:30.941 --> 00:21:31.121
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

861
00:21:31.121 --> 00:21:34.070
<v Speaker 6>the fact that we now have so much knowledge and information,</v>

862
00:21:34.071 --> 00:21:34.390
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

863
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.310
<v Speaker 6>at her disposal is an extraordinary thing,</v>

864
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:36.760
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

865
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.100
<v Speaker 6>But then the question is still how do we manage that?</v>

866
00:21:39.101 --> 00:21:40.990
<v Speaker 6>What do we do with it and what type of,</v>

867
00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.193
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

868
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.670
<v Speaker 6>society can we pull ourselves into?</v>

869
00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:47.310
<v Speaker 6>Because at the moment what we have is,</v>

870
00:21:47.311 --> 00:21:48.730
<v Speaker 6>is not going to last very much longer.</v>

871
00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:49.730
<v Speaker 1>I liked what you said,</v>

872
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.240
<v Speaker 1>pull,</v>

873
00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.230
<v Speaker 1>pull ourselves into,</v>

874
00:21:51.231 --> 00:21:51.891
<v Speaker 1>because it's really,</v>

875
00:21:51.891 --> 00:21:55.250
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have to be that because it's gonna you're gonna have to pull away</v>

876
00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.860
<v Speaker 1>from the system that we have now that,</v>

877
00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:57.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

878
00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:01.070
<v Speaker 1>especially the financial system and we've learned from when Ron Paul wanted the</v>

879
00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:04.430
<v Speaker 1>audits of the bail outs and people found out how many trillions of dollars had</v>

880
00:22:04.431 --> 00:22:06.380
<v Speaker 1>been sent into the,</v>

881
00:22:06.381 --> 00:22:06.681
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

882
00:22:06.681 --> 00:22:07.790
<v Speaker 1>this whole idea of,</v>

883
00:22:07.791 --> 00:22:08.630
<v Speaker 1>of bailouts and it,</v>

884
00:22:08.631 --> 00:22:09.680
<v Speaker 1>where this tax dollars went.</v>

885
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:14.720
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people became really disillusioned and disenfranchised and,</v>

886
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.700
<v Speaker 1>and it had no connection to it.</v>

887
00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.570
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

888
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:17.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

889
00:22:17.811 --> 00:22:17.991
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

890
00:22:17.991 --> 00:22:18.201
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

891
00:22:18.201 --> 00:22:18.711
<v Speaker 1>when it happened,</v>

892
00:22:18.711 --> 00:22:22.250
<v Speaker 1>did it make any sense to you when you were hearing him about the bailouts at any</v>

893
00:22:22.251 --> 00:22:24.230
<v Speaker 1>of that make any sense to you and don't pay attention?</v>

894
00:22:24.231 --> 00:22:24.521
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

895
00:22:24.521 --> 00:22:24.680
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

896
00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.061
<v Speaker 1>it seems,</v>

897
00:22:25.061 --> 00:22:26.780
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a system you can't fix.</v>

898
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.350
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like I,</v>

899
00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:28.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

900
00:22:28.791 --> 00:22:32.510
<v Speaker 1>it almost feels like trying to go against the machine that's currently in place</v>

901
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.110
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

902
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.711
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

903
00:22:33.711 --> 00:22:34.850
<v Speaker 1>it's so intangible.</v>

904
00:22:34.851 --> 00:22:36.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like so gigantic.</v>

905
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:41.320
<v Speaker 1>The financial system is completely and utterly corrupt and unrecognizable.</v>

906
00:22:41.511 --> 00:22:43.280
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to understand.</v>

907
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:43.631
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

908
00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:44.141
<v Speaker 6>Well that's like,</v>

909
00:22:44.141 --> 00:22:46.990
<v Speaker 6>I've been a bunch of the work I've been doing over the last few years.</v>

910
00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:47.321
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

911
00:22:47.321 --> 00:22:47.461
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

912
00:22:47.461 --> 00:22:47.661
<v Speaker 6>in the,</v>

913
00:22:47.661 --> 00:22:48.461
<v Speaker 6>in the film,</v>

914
00:22:48.461 --> 00:22:49.480
<v Speaker 6>actually we interviewed you for the film.</v>

915
00:22:49.481 --> 00:22:50.590
<v Speaker 6>We didn't end up using your interview.</v>

916
00:22:50.591 --> 00:22:51.730
<v Speaker 6>We just couldn't somehow splice it.</v>

917
00:22:51.731 --> 00:22:55.000
<v Speaker 6>And I document online in 2012 time for change.</v>

918
00:22:55.001 --> 00:22:55.721
<v Speaker 6>And we interviewed this guy,</v>

919
00:22:55.721 --> 00:22:56.141
<v Speaker 6>Bernard,</v>

920
00:22:56.141 --> 00:22:56.974
<v Speaker 6>Leah Tarr,</v>

921
00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:57.561
<v Speaker 6>who was a,</v>

922
00:22:57.561 --> 00:22:58.241
<v Speaker 6>he's an economist.</v>

923
00:22:58.241 --> 00:22:59.770
<v Speaker 6>He was one of the architects of the euro.</v>

924
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.810
<v Speaker 6>You wrote a great book called the future of money.</v>

925
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.290
<v Speaker 6>And in that book he,</v>

926
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:03.561
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

927
00:23:03.561 --> 00:23:04.210
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

928
00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:05.021
<v Speaker 6>and in our film also,</v>

929
00:23:05.021 --> 00:23:08.050
<v Speaker 6>we discussed how the financial system is broken and it really doesn't matter at</v>

930
00:23:08.051 --> 00:23:11.380
<v Speaker 6>this point who you put in control because it's still just like a car with no</v>

931
00:23:11.381 --> 00:23:12.214
<v Speaker 6>brakes.</v>

932
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.160
<v Speaker 6>But that actually we're going to have to reinvent,</v>

933
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:15.640
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

934
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.430
<v Speaker 6>instruments for,</v>

935
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:20.920
<v Speaker 6>for exchanging value that actually have fundamentally different,</v>

936
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.200
<v Speaker 6>different value systems connected to them.</v>

937
00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:24.281
<v Speaker 6>So for instance,</v>

938
00:23:24.281 --> 00:23:27.940
<v Speaker 6>he proposes a currency which he closes the terror that has a negative interest</v>

939
00:23:27.941 --> 00:23:28.750
<v Speaker 6>charge.</v>

940
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:30.070
<v Speaker 6>So it's a new trading currency,</v>

941
00:23:30.071 --> 00:23:34.300
<v Speaker 6>big global trading currency that's indexed not to just a virtual abstraction</v>

942
00:23:34.301 --> 00:23:35.230
<v Speaker 6>like our money currently is,</v>

943
00:23:35.231 --> 00:23:40.231
<v Speaker 6>but actually it's index to a basket of real world goods and resources that</v>

944
00:23:40.391 --> 00:23:41.890
<v Speaker 6>decline in value over time.</v>

945
00:23:41.891 --> 00:23:43.120
<v Speaker 6>Cause most things do,</v>

946
00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:43.811
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

947
00:23:43.811 --> 00:23:44.041
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

948
00:23:44.041 --> 00:23:46.430
<v Speaker 6>so if the longer you held onto a terror,</v>

949
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.840
<v Speaker 6>the less it would be worth.</v>

950
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.350
<v Speaker 1>So instead of a gold standard,</v>

951
00:23:49.351 --> 00:23:51.840
<v Speaker 1>it would be made based on a bunch of,</v>

952
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.591
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

953
00:23:52.591 --> 00:23:55.590
<v Speaker 6>I'm a bundle of resources that would include things cool.</v>

954
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.180
<v Speaker 6>And wheat and you know,</v>

955
00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.980
<v Speaker 6>processed foods and unprocessed goods and so on.</v>

956
00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:00.460
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

957
00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.001
<v Speaker 6>and as,</v>

958
00:24:01.001 --> 00:24:01.241
<v Speaker 6>as,</v>

959
00:24:01.241 --> 00:24:01.490
<v Speaker 6>as,</v>

960
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:01.811
<v Speaker 6>as,</v>

961
00:24:01.811 --> 00:24:03.070
<v Speaker 6>as a summation of all of that,</v>

962
00:24:03.071 --> 00:24:03.221
<v Speaker 6>it would,</v>

963
00:24:03.221 --> 00:24:04.600
<v Speaker 6>it would actually decline in value.</v>

964
00:24:04.601 --> 00:24:06.460
<v Speaker 6>It would have what's called a demo Raj charge.</v>

965
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.910
<v Speaker 6>So when people got a bunch of these terrorists through some business deal,</v>

966
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.490
<v Speaker 6>rather than seeking to hoard them or hold on to them,</v>

967
00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.481
<v Speaker 6>that wouldn't work.</v>

968
00:24:13.481 --> 00:24:14.350
<v Speaker 6>So they would eat best,</v>

969
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:14.890
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

970
00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.950
<v Speaker 6>used by putting them back into circulation by sharing them or,</v>

971
00:24:17.951 --> 00:24:18.281
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>

972
00:24:18.281 --> 00:24:19.114
<v Speaker 6>or whatever.</v>

973
00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:19.571
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

974
00:24:19.571 --> 00:24:19.971
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

975
00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:20.130
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

976
00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.900
<v Speaker 6>that's Leotard is concept and one of many concepts.</v>

977
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:23.430
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

978
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.650
<v Speaker 6>we're actually publishing a book through my company evolver called sacred</v>

979
00:24:26.651 --> 00:24:28.450
<v Speaker 6>economics by Charles Eisenstein.</v>

980
00:24:28.451 --> 00:24:29.710
<v Speaker 6>It's actually already up on,</v>

981
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:29.850
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

982
00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:31.990
<v Speaker 6>it's out on the Internet and you can get copies,</v>

983
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:37.000
<v Speaker 6>but he actually puts together a whole paradigm looking at the inevitability of,</v>

984
00:24:37.001 --> 00:24:41.320
<v Speaker 6>of the financial system breaking down and really seeing that rather than just</v>

985
00:24:41.321 --> 00:24:43.290
<v Speaker 6>having one monopoly of,</v>

986
00:24:43.291 --> 00:24:43.641
<v Speaker 6>of a,</v>

987
00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:45.550
<v Speaker 6>of a value exchanging instrument,</v>

988
00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.890
<v Speaker 6>like money that's controlled by private banking and trusts,</v>

989
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.940
<v Speaker 6>you could really create a whole ecology of different ways of exchanging value</v>

990
00:24:51.941 --> 00:24:53.590
<v Speaker 6>that would be used for different purposes.</v>

991
00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the government would ever allow something like that to</v>

992
00:24:56.221 --> 00:24:57.031
<v Speaker 1>actually take place?</v>

993
00:24:57.031 --> 00:24:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean it almost seems like trying to create a government inside the government.</v>

994
00:24:59.610 --> 00:24:59.701
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

995
00:24:59.701 --> 00:25:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's happened before I'm in for instance in the Depression and they</v>

996
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.380
<v Speaker 1>reissued a lot of local currencies.</v>

997
00:25:04.381 --> 00:25:05.790
<v Speaker 1>It has also done in the 19th century.</v>

998
00:25:05.791 --> 00:25:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you know that about a town in North Carolina or South Carolina that's</v>

999
00:25:09.121 --> 00:25:10.230
<v Speaker 1>trying to do that right now.</v>

1000
00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:10.951
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1001
00:25:10.951 --> 00:25:11.721
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that's,</v>

1002
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:12.030
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1003
00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.940
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely going to be on the horizon because people are not going to be</v>

1004
00:25:14.941 --> 00:25:15.631
<v Speaker 1>able to use this.</v>

1005
00:25:15.631 --> 00:25:15.820
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1006
00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.230
<v Speaker 1>there was a small town and they had their own currency in his town and there was</v>

1007
00:25:19.231 --> 00:25:20.790
<v Speaker 1>a debate about its legality.</v>

1008
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.060
<v Speaker 6>And in fact if you look at,</v>

1009
00:25:23.061 --> 00:25:23.331
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1010
00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:27.320
<v Speaker 6>the bankruptcy of the government and the effects of a p Coyle and I'm all this</v>

1011
00:25:27.321 --> 00:25:28.220
<v Speaker 6>other stuff going on,</v>

1012
00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:33.110
<v Speaker 6>the capacity of the federal government to intervene into metal may actually</v>

1013
00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:37.130
<v Speaker 6>become radically reduced and the next and the next years because there's just</v>

1014
00:25:37.131 --> 00:25:39.770
<v Speaker 6>not going to be the money available for that kind of endless,</v>

1015
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:40.610
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1016
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:41.443
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1017
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.433
<v Speaker 6>effort.</v>

1018
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.500
<v Speaker 6>Damn I face is melting</v>

1019
00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.740
<v Speaker 1>thinking about when you're saying,</v>

1020
00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:49.711
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1021
00:25:49.711 --> 00:25:52.940
<v Speaker 1>It was like just so much information I'm thinking about right now.</v>

1022
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1023
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:54.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1024
00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.340
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that none of this will actually happen that will sort of stumble</v>

1025
00:25:58.341 --> 00:25:59.150
<v Speaker 1>into the finish line?</v>

1026
00:25:59.150 --> 00:25:59.301
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1027
00:25:59.301 --> 00:26:00.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not possible.</v>

1028
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

1029
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.700
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely not possible.</v>

1030
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:06.580
<v Speaker 1>So you think it's absolutely 100% that the society that we currently enjoy is</v>

1031
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:07.190
<v Speaker 1>going to collapse?</v>

1032
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1033
00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.693
<v Speaker 1>100%.</v>

1034
00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.520
<v Speaker 1>What kind of timeframe are you to have in it?</v>

1035
00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:11.080
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1036
00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:11.830
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1037
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:12.930
<v Speaker 6>could be a year,</v>

1038
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:14.170
<v Speaker 6>could be 10 or 15 years.</v>

1039
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.651
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1040
00:26:14.651 --> 00:26:14.860
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

1041
00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.630
<v Speaker 6>but the point is to recognize that,</v>

1042
00:26:16.631 --> 00:26:16.901
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1043
00:26:16.901 --> 00:26:17.051
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>

1044
00:26:17.051 --> 00:26:17.741
<v Speaker 6>we're in it now.</v>

1045
00:26:17.741 --> 00:26:18.061
<v Speaker 6>I mean that,</v>

1046
00:26:18.061 --> 00:26:18.251
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1047
00:26:18.251 --> 00:26:18.461
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1048
00:26:18.461 --> 00:26:18.671
<v Speaker 6>our,</v>

1049
00:26:18.671 --> 00:26:20.170
<v Speaker 6>our faith in capitalism,</v>

1050
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:23.860
<v Speaker 6>capitalism is a system that has an inherent unstability to it.</v>

1051
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.060
<v Speaker 6>And basically what it requires is constantly new markets that need to be turned</v>

1052
00:26:28.061 --> 00:26:30.640
<v Speaker 6>into money so you can keep the dynamics of now you can wait,</v>

1053
00:26:30.641 --> 00:26:33.160
<v Speaker 6>you can keep the debt growing and you keep extending the credit.</v>

1054
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:33.951
<v Speaker 6>But we,</v>

1055
00:26:33.951 --> 00:26:34.211
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

1056
00:26:34.211 --> 00:26:34.391
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1057
00:26:34.391 --> 00:26:38.050
<v Speaker 6>but what I think what we're going to realize soon enough is that capitalism was</v>

1058
00:26:38.051 --> 00:26:39.190
<v Speaker 6>not a final system.</v>

1059
00:26:39.191 --> 00:26:40.600
<v Speaker 6>It was a transitional system.</v>

1060
00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.700
<v Speaker 6>We don't know what that transition is into yet,</v>

1061
00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.090
<v Speaker 6>but is like an adolescent in system.</v>

1062
00:26:45.091 --> 00:26:46.260
<v Speaker 6>It's like aggressive,</v>

1063
00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:47.190
<v Speaker 6>compulsive,</v>

1064
00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:48.150
<v Speaker 6>competitive,</v>

1065
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:48.361
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1066
00:26:48.361 --> 00:26:49.001
<v Speaker 6>at a certain point.</v>

1067
00:26:49.001 --> 00:26:53.040
<v Speaker 6>And you'd have to shift into maturity and adulthood and you have to let go of</v>

1068
00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:55.470
<v Speaker 6>some of that adolescent compulsion.</v>

1069
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.200
<v Speaker 1>How important is psychedelics in this equation?</v>

1070
00:26:58.201 --> 00:27:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Because the best tool,</v>

1071
00:27:00.361 --> 00:27:01.320
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

1072
00:27:01.321 --> 00:27:03.750
<v Speaker 1>to sort of calm down that those instincts,</v>

1073
00:27:03.751 --> 00:27:08.100
<v Speaker 1>those competitive super hyper aggressive instincts is psychedelics.</v>

1074
00:27:08.101 --> 00:27:08.934
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

1075
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:10.530
<v Speaker 6>we try most illegal things.</v>

1076
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:11.380
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1077
00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.000
<v Speaker 6>I think that really helps.</v>

1078
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:14.580
<v Speaker 6>It's awesome.</v>

1079
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.590
<v Speaker 6>It's funny because it makes me violent when I watch it.</v>

1080
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.310
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

1081
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.440
<v Speaker 6>Why it's so fun.</v>

1082
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.630
<v Speaker 6>So I think that psychedelics have tremendous value.</v>

1083
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:21.920
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1084
00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.680
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

1085
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 6>people always say that I'm an advocate of psychedelics.</v>

1086
00:27:24.541 --> 00:27:26.160
<v Speaker 6>And I suppose that's true to a certain extent.</v>

1087
00:27:26.161 --> 00:27:27.870
<v Speaker 6>But I also feel that it's an individual decision.</v>

1088
00:27:27.871 --> 00:27:28.860
<v Speaker 6>They're not for everybody.</v>

1089
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:31.200
<v Speaker 6>And obviously there's still illegal and frowned upon in our society.</v>

1090
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.790
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1091
00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:32.010
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

1092
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.250
<v Speaker 6>but the fact is that one of the values of psychedelics is they kind of</v>

1093
00:27:35.251 --> 00:27:38.760
<v Speaker 6>decondition you from your present state of consciousness and your,</v>

1094
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.610
<v Speaker 6>and your kind of social ideology and belief system.</v>

1095
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:42.031
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1096
00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:43.880
<v Speaker 6>there's a kind of peeling away when,</v>

1097
00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:45.630
<v Speaker 6>I remember the first time I took mushrooms,</v>

1098
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:49.380
<v Speaker 6>one of the first experiences I had was going to a deli and buying something with</v>

1099
00:27:49.381 --> 00:27:54.000
<v Speaker 6>money and just finding it totally ludicrous that our culture invested so much</v>

1100
00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.600
<v Speaker 6>belief and these wrinkly brown ugly pieces of paper,</v>

1101
00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:58.090
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1102
00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.560
<v Speaker 6>and that everybody was kind of so disconnected from their present experience and</v>

1103
00:28:01.561 --> 00:28:06.270
<v Speaker 6>focused on the sports or the stock ticker or all this crap and for my opinion,</v>

1104
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.871
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1105
00:28:06.871 --> 00:28:07.081
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

1106
00:28:07.081 --> 00:28:07.321
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

1107
00:28:07.321 --> 00:28:12.321
<v Speaker 6>so I think that peeling away back to a kind of phenomenological as they say,</v>

1108
00:28:12.481 --> 00:28:14.400
<v Speaker 6>level of just presence of being,</v>

1109
00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:14.880
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

1110
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.290
<v Speaker 6>that's a very powerful thing.</v>

1111
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.250
<v Speaker 6>And we tend,</v>

1112
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:18.440
<v Speaker 6>as humans,</v>

1113
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.300
<v Speaker 6>it's very easy for us to get lost in,</v>

1114
00:28:20.301 --> 00:28:20.640
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

1115
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.500
<v Speaker 6>in abstractions and concepts.</v>

1116
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.810
<v Speaker 6>And we take her and we then we believe in our concepts.</v>

1117
00:28:24.811 --> 00:28:26.400
<v Speaker 6>We think that they're real,</v>

1118
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:26.790
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1119
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:27.780
<v Speaker 6>so the psychedelics can,</v>

1120
00:28:27.781 --> 00:28:28.770
<v Speaker 6>can break that,</v>

1121
00:28:28.771 --> 00:28:29.110
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1122
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.331
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1123
00:28:29.331 --> 00:28:32.430
<v Speaker 6>that investment we've made and all these things that we think are real,</v>

1124
00:28:32.431 --> 00:28:34.080
<v Speaker 6>that are just abstractions and concepts.</v>

1125
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Does it have to be either or can you enjoy a good movie and still be a person</v>

1126
00:28:38.871 --> 00:28:43.871
<v Speaker 1>who believes that we're evolving as a consciousness and that we are in an</v>

1127
00:28:44.241 --> 00:28:47.720
<v Speaker 1>adolescent state of evolution and somehow or another we're in a transitionary</v>

1128
00:28:47.721 --> 00:28:48.620
<v Speaker 1>period and we're all coming at Kipp,</v>

1129
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.960
<v Speaker 1>but can't you just enjoy the x men?</v>

1130
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.550
<v Speaker 1>I actually thought I love the x men movies or just tell him and tell him what's</v>

1131
00:28:55.551 --> 00:28:55.701
<v Speaker 1>called.</v>

1132
00:28:55.701 --> 00:28:56.241
<v Speaker 1>Movies are cool,</v>

1133
00:28:56.241 --> 00:28:57.074
<v Speaker 1>but TV's not.</v>

1134
00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see walking dead?</v>

1135
00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.260
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking good show man.</v>

1136
00:29:00.261 --> 00:29:02.720
<v Speaker 1>There's zombies and these people trying to survive.</v>

1137
00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.770
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking fun.</v>

1138
00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I like to sit in front of something and watch some shit that somebody</v>

1139
00:29:07.971 --> 00:29:09.740
<v Speaker 1>created that's supposed to been an entertain me.</v>

1140
00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it has to cut your capacity for thinking and reason and logic and</v>

1141
00:29:15.621 --> 00:29:16.454
<v Speaker 1>original thought.</v>

1142
00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:17.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it has to.</v>

1143
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.220
<v Speaker 1>I think you could just be fun to watch.</v>

1144
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.040
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people are conditioned by,</v>

1145
00:29:22.041 --> 00:29:22.970
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are weak,</v>

1146
00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.000
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people fucking eat cheeseburgers all day and become 700.</v>

1147
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.040
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1148
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:27.321
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1149
00:29:27.321 --> 00:29:27.760
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1150
00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.940
<v Speaker 6>I'm not like in a,</v>

1151
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:29.301
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1152
00:29:29.301 --> 00:29:29.531
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

1153
00:29:29.531 --> 00:29:31.670
<v Speaker 6>I don't judge you enjoy whatever you want to enjoy.</v>

1154
00:29:31.671 --> 00:29:32.361
<v Speaker 6>I don't really care.</v>

1155
00:29:32.361 --> 00:29:32.571
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1156
00:29:32.571 --> 00:29:33.500
<v Speaker 6>I'm personally,</v>

1157
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:33.980
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1158
00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:34.761
<v Speaker 6>what I like are,</v>

1159
00:29:34.761 --> 00:29:35.530
<v Speaker 6>are kind of,</v>

1160
00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:38.570
<v Speaker 6>when I get excited now about popular narratives,</v>

1161
00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:38.950
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1162
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:43.480
<v Speaker 6>it's more because I see in them the seeds of part of this transformation that's</v>

1163
00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:44.500
<v Speaker 6>underway now.</v>

1164
00:29:44.501 --> 00:29:44.921
<v Speaker 6>For instance,</v>

1165
00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:49.870
<v Speaker 6>if you look at like a lot of the most archetypally huge stories that our culture</v>

1166
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:50.860
<v Speaker 6>keeps telling us,</v>

1167
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.300
<v Speaker 6>which includes the mutant,</v>

1168
00:29:52.301 --> 00:29:52.421
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1169
00:29:52.421 --> 00:29:53.380
<v Speaker 6>the x man,</v>

1170
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:54.730
<v Speaker 6>Harry Potter,</v>

1171
00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:54.940
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1172
00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.560
<v Speaker 6>Lord of the Ring [inaudible] for a certain extent.</v>

1173
00:29:56.561 --> 00:29:56.720
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

1174
00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.250
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1175
00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:58.031
<v Speaker 6>Star Wars,</v>

1176
00:29:58.031 --> 00:30:02.020
<v Speaker 6>let's say avatar destroy that's repeated over and over again is there's like</v>

1177
00:30:02.021 --> 00:30:03.160
<v Speaker 6>this hero's journey.</v>

1178
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.630
<v Speaker 6>And as part of that hero's journey,</v>

1179
00:30:04.631 --> 00:30:08.800
<v Speaker 6>there has to be a learning to use our psychic faculties,</v>

1180
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:09.401
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1181
00:30:09.401 --> 00:30:09.671
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

1182
00:30:09.671 --> 00:30:10.091
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

1183
00:30:10.091 --> 00:30:10.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1184
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:11.030
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1185
00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:11.820
<v Speaker 6>the matrix,</v>

1186
00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:12.220
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1187
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:12.460
<v Speaker 6>those,</v>

1188
00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.293
<v Speaker 6>we're all superheroes,</v>

1189
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:14.163
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

1190
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:14.531
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1191
00:30:14.531 --> 00:30:14.811
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1192
00:30:14.811 --> 00:30:16.660
<v Speaker 6>so if you look at a Mutans,</v>

1193
00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:17.770
<v Speaker 6>they're going to this academy.</v>

1194
00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:19.270
<v Speaker 6>They have to learn how to master these power,</v>

1195
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:19.991
<v Speaker 6>normal gifts.</v>

1196
00:30:19.991 --> 00:30:20.171
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1197
00:30:20.171 --> 00:30:20.831
<v Speaker 6>Harry Potter,</v>

1198
00:30:20.831 --> 00:30:22.540
<v Speaker 6>you have to learn to cast your spells,</v>

1199
00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:23.321
<v Speaker 6>Star Wars,</v>

1200
00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:24.580
<v Speaker 6>you have to use the force.</v>

1201
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.031
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1202
00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:25.631
<v Speaker 6>I actually,</v>

1203
00:30:25.631 --> 00:30:28.510
<v Speaker 6>the more that I've thought about it and the more my own experiences have kind of</v>

1204
00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:29.890
<v Speaker 6>echoed some of these things,</v>

1205
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.490
<v Speaker 6>I think that these stories are,</v>

1206
00:30:31.491 --> 00:30:31.671
<v Speaker 6>are,</v>

1207
00:30:31.671 --> 00:30:36.671
<v Speaker 6>are so powerful because they represent a kind of yearning that people have for</v>

1208
00:30:36.851 --> 00:30:39.700
<v Speaker 6>kind of initiatory training and extra sensory perception.</v>

1209
00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:44.260
<v Speaker 6>And that is something that our society has rigorously denied us.</v>

1210
00:30:44.261 --> 00:30:44.810
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

1211
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:46.900
<v Speaker 6>And I think if you look at like what happens to you when you're like an</v>

1212
00:30:46.901 --> 00:30:47.471
<v Speaker 6>adolescent,</v>

1213
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:49.450
<v Speaker 6>like let's say you're a 1520 years old,</v>

1214
00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:49.841
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1215
00:30:49.841 --> 00:30:50.350
<v Speaker 6>you have this,</v>

1216
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:50.590
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1217
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.560
<v Speaker 6>you have this beginning and when you're young teenager you have this tremendous</v>

1218
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:55.300
<v Speaker 6>sense of expectation.</v>

1219
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.620
<v Speaker 6>You're like waiting for some transformative thing to happen to you and then it</v>

1220
00:30:59.621 --> 00:31:00.580
<v Speaker 6>doesn't happen.</v>

1221
00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:03.790
<v Speaker 6>And so instead you accept a lot of basically crappy,</v>

1222
00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:06.880
<v Speaker 6>degraded substitutes like dulling entertainment.</v>

1223
00:31:06.881 --> 00:31:07.211
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1224
00:31:07.211 --> 00:31:07.511
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1225
00:31:07.511 --> 00:31:10.480
<v Speaker 6>watching athletes do this and that or whatever,</v>

1226
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:10.841
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1227
00:31:10.841 --> 00:31:15.370
<v Speaker 6>rather than having gone through something that you always just know is missing</v>

1228
00:31:15.371 --> 00:31:15.701
<v Speaker 6>but that,</v>

1229
00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:17.740
<v Speaker 6>but then the culture kind of like hides it from you.</v>

1230
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.370
<v Speaker 6>And I think that that thing that that's missing from our culture is this direct</v>

1231
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:23.020
<v Speaker 6>initiatory process.</v>

1232
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.030
<v Speaker 6>How was the culture hiding it from you though?</v>

1233
00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:25.421
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1234
00:31:25.421 --> 00:31:25.871
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1235
00:31:25.871 --> 00:31:27.070
<v Speaker 6>I think the culture,</v>

1236
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:30.130
<v Speaker 6>the water sort of seeks its own level and a lot of these things and a lot of</v>

1237
00:31:30.131 --> 00:31:32.170
<v Speaker 6>people just get lazy and don't look for it.</v>

1238
00:31:32.171 --> 00:31:34.420
<v Speaker 6>And this culture that's opening up right now,</v>

1239
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:40.340
<v Speaker 6>experiences now or being detailed and talked about that people could never</v>

1240
00:31:40.601 --> 00:31:44.290
<v Speaker 6>understand before the connection that people have together through the Internet</v>

1241
00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:45.400
<v Speaker 6>now it's,</v>

1242
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:45.690
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

1243
00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:47.440
<v Speaker 6>there's never been anything like this before.</v>

1244
00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:47.891
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1245
00:31:47.891 --> 00:31:48.291
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

1246
00:31:48.291 --> 00:31:50.110
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's getting dumber.</v>

1247
00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.210
<v Speaker 6>I think there's always gonna be a certain amount of dumb people.</v>

1248
00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.380
<v Speaker 6>I think there's always going to be a certain lot of people who smoke cigarettes.</v>

1249
00:31:54.381 --> 00:31:54.610
<v Speaker 6>Totally.</v>

1250
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:54.730
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1251
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:55.070
<v Speaker 6>I think we,</v>

1252
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.110
<v Speaker 6>I just stopped actually recently,</v>

1253
00:31:56.111 --> 00:31:56.900
<v Speaker 6>which was very exciting.</v>

1254
00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:57.250
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>

1255
00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:58.270
<v Speaker 6>You smoked cigarettes?</v>

1256
00:31:58.810 --> 00:31:59.141
<v Speaker 6>Pathetic.</v>

1257
00:31:59.141 --> 00:31:59.974
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1258
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:02.000
<v Speaker 6>Just for smart guy.</v>

1259
00:32:02.001 --> 00:32:02.260
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1260
00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:02.501
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

1261
00:32:02.501 --> 00:32:02.800
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

1262
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.940
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck is that?</v>

1263
00:32:03.941 --> 00:32:04.390
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1264
00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:04.990
<v Speaker 6>I apologize.</v>

1265
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.470
<v Speaker 6>That's ruthless it</v>

1266
00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:08.890
<v Speaker 6>bro.</v>

1267
00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:09.723
<v Speaker 6>I swear to</v>

1268
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:14.650
<v Speaker 6>fuck with you because I love you because [inaudible] actually it was through</v>

1269
00:32:14.651 --> 00:32:16.460
<v Speaker 6>Iowasca that I stopped actually was through.</v>

1270
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:17.980
<v Speaker 6>I lost what I started also to be honest,</v>

1271
00:32:17.981 --> 00:32:20.740
<v Speaker 6>cause there's a whole relationship between Iowasca shamanism and the Amazon and</v>

1272
00:32:20.741 --> 00:32:21.574
<v Speaker 6>tobacco.</v>

1273
00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:22.750
<v Speaker 6>That's when I first started smoking.</v>

1274
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.010
<v Speaker 6>It was low tobacco on you,</v>

1275
00:32:24.011 --> 00:32:24.250
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1276
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:24.761
<v Speaker 6>They do.</v>

1277
00:32:24.761 --> 00:32:25.271
<v Speaker 6>And it's also,</v>

1278
00:32:25.271 --> 00:32:28.060
<v Speaker 6>there's something about the tobacco and Iowasca that are very synergetic</v>

1279
00:32:28.061 --> 00:32:28.391
<v Speaker 6>together.</v>

1280
00:32:28.391 --> 00:32:29.200
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's a,</v>

1281
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:29.411
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1282
00:32:29.411 --> 00:32:32.710
<v Speaker 6>tobacco is considered a very important power plant.</v>

1283
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:33.840
<v Speaker 6>Why didn't you first,</v>

1284
00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.140
<v Speaker 6>why didn't you try cigars?</v>

1285
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:36.550
<v Speaker 6>We can get natural tobacco.</v>

1286
00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:37.901
<v Speaker 6>Tobacco,</v>

1287
00:32:37.901 --> 00:32:38.350
<v Speaker 6>I tried.</v>

1288
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:39.660
<v Speaker 6>The guards are way function.</v>

1289
00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 6>I mean</v>

1290
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.810
<v Speaker 4>they're probably not the best thing for you,</v>

1291
00:32:41.811 --> 00:32:43.310
<v Speaker 4>but they're better for you than cigarettes.</v>

1292
00:32:43.311 --> 00:32:43.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1293
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:44.090
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

1294
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:48.110
<v Speaker 4>It's all the chemicals in cigarettes that are natural American spirits.</v>

1295
00:32:48.111 --> 00:32:49.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean I stayed at least at that level.</v>

1296
00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:51.830
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it hurts me more though.</v>

1297
00:32:51.831 --> 00:32:53.440
<v Speaker 3>Like when I do natural spirits it's,</v>

1298
00:32:53.441 --> 00:32:55.100
<v Speaker 3>it's like the next day I'm coughing up black.</v>

1299
00:32:55.101 --> 00:32:58.300
<v Speaker 3>It's cause it's not giving you any numbing powers like slick car.</v>

1300
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:03.340
<v Speaker 3>There's 590 fucking ingredients in cigarettes that by the way usually made</v>

1301
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.020
<v Speaker 3>government approved or did anybody really</v>

1302
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:09.530
<v Speaker 4>go over all those 590 you know a lobbyist,</v>

1303
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1304
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.280
<v Speaker 4>You know who the fuck went over all those ingredients and made sure that they're</v>

1305
00:33:13.281 --> 00:33:13.920
<v Speaker 4>all cool.</v>

1306
00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.240
<v Speaker 4>People are dying half a million a year in America alone.</v>

1307
00:33:17.241 --> 00:33:19.400
<v Speaker 4>Directly related to cigarette smoking.</v>

1308
00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:20.191
<v Speaker 3>What you were saying?</v>

1309
00:33:20.191 --> 00:33:20.460
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1310
00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:21.570
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people probably,</v>

1311
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.170
<v Speaker 3>I think also feel like they did accomplish what they wanted in life.</v>

1312
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:25.831
<v Speaker 3>Like I think that's,</v>

1313
00:33:25.831 --> 00:33:30.030
<v Speaker 3>it seems like it seems almost a negative that you say it like that because I</v>

1314
00:33:30.031 --> 00:33:30.721
<v Speaker 3>talked to my dad,</v>

1315
00:33:30.721 --> 00:33:30.991
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

1316
00:33:30.991 --> 00:33:31.620
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah,</v>

1317
00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.570
<v Speaker 3>this is exactly what I wanted to do with my life.</v>

1318
00:33:33.571 --> 00:33:34.560
<v Speaker 3>I had loved my life.</v>

1319
00:33:34.561 --> 00:33:36.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy I'm married.</v>

1320
00:33:36.151 --> 00:33:36.891
<v Speaker 3>I know they'll do it.</v>

1321
00:33:36.891 --> 00:33:38.070
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think your Dad's pretty smart?</v>

1322
00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.390
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1323
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:39.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1324
00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.300
<v Speaker 3>unless I think that's just a negative look.</v>

1325
00:33:42.301 --> 00:33:43.800
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people like what they do.</v>

1326
00:33:43.801 --> 00:33:44.011
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1327
00:33:44.011 --> 00:33:45.810
<v Speaker 3>you're going to definitely a job though.</v>

1328
00:33:45.811 --> 00:33:47.970
<v Speaker 3>You've got an easy job at all.</v>

1329
00:33:47.971 --> 00:33:48.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about me at all.</v>

1330
00:33:48.961 --> 00:33:50.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about like my mom,</v>

1331
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:51.270
<v Speaker 3>my dad,</v>

1332
00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:51.600
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>

1333
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Everyone I grew up around with,</v>

1334
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.720
<v Speaker 3>they all liked what they did.</v>

1335
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:59.410
<v Speaker 3>Well you might've been lucky and you grew up in the Midwest and I'm offering you</v>

1336
00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.020
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>

1337
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.200
<v Speaker 3>you know my way of thinking about it.</v>

1338
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:01.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1339
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.490
<v Speaker 3>I think he might be your friend.</v>

1340
00:34:02.491 --> 00:34:03.324
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1341
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.120
<v Speaker 3>my personal experience growing up was like,</v>

1342
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1343
00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:07.141
<v Speaker 3>I fought,</v>

1344
00:34:07.141 --> 00:34:09.570
<v Speaker 3>there would be this amazing thing that would happen.</v>

1345
00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:10.613
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1346
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:11.290
<v Speaker 3>Have</v>

1347
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:11.861
<v Speaker 4>those things,</v>

1348
00:34:11.861 --> 00:34:12.071
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1349
00:34:12.071 --> 00:34:12.910
<v Speaker 4>You gotta you know,</v>

1350
00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:13.330
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1351
00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:17.260
<v Speaker 4>I've always said that there should be some sort of a right of right of manhood</v>

1352
00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:18.123
<v Speaker 4>or right.</v>

1353
00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.970
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have to be even a man who'd thing attached to like something manly or</v>

1354
00:34:21.971 --> 00:34:22.750
<v Speaker 4>aggressive.</v>

1355
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:23.171
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1356
00:34:23.171 --> 00:34:25.150
<v Speaker 4>as to finding your character,</v>

1357
00:34:25.151 --> 00:34:26.320
<v Speaker 4>finding your limitations,</v>

1358
00:34:26.321 --> 00:34:27.490
<v Speaker 4>doing something extraordinary.</v>

1359
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.621
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1360
00:34:27.621 --> 00:34:27.791
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1361
00:34:27.791 --> 00:34:28.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1362
00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:28.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1363
00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:32.320
<v Speaker 4>some of the thinkers that I wrote about in my books talked about how cultures</v>

1364
00:34:32.321 --> 00:34:36.490
<v Speaker 4>need to have some type of initiatory ritual and if they don't have it</v>

1365
00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.170
<v Speaker 4>consciously constructed,</v>

1366
00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.480
<v Speaker 4>it'll end up being unconsciously,</v>

1367
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:40.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1368
00:34:40.781 --> 00:34:41.530
<v Speaker 4>destructive.</v>

1369
00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:45.970
<v Speaker 4>It'll happen through war or through destruction of the environment or something.</v>

1370
00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:46.361
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1371
00:34:46.361 --> 00:34:46.781
<v Speaker 4>so one,</v>

1372
00:34:46.781 --> 00:34:48.820
<v Speaker 4>one theory that I have about the,</v>

1373
00:34:48.821 --> 00:34:49.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1374
00:34:49.031 --> 00:34:52.840
<v Speaker 4>quote unquote 2012 or this transition that we're in is that it's almost on an</v>

1375
00:34:52.841 --> 00:34:54.160
<v Speaker 4>unconscious level.</v>

1376
00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:54.581
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1377
00:34:54.581 --> 00:34:56.590
<v Speaker 4>humanity has not been able to change its behavior,</v>

1378
00:34:56.591 --> 00:34:56.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1379
00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:57.081
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

1380
00:34:57.081 --> 00:34:58.810
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's on an unconscious level.</v>

1381
00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:03.250
<v Speaker 4>We're kind of willing ourselves into a state of catastrophe to bring about an</v>

1382
00:35:03.251 --> 00:35:06.610
<v Speaker 4>initiation and thereby a transformation of consciousness.</v>

1383
00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.180
<v Speaker 4>100% sure of that,</v>

1384
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:13.410
<v Speaker 4>that 94% that's strong,</v>

1385
00:35:13.411 --> 00:35:13.691
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1386
00:35:13.691 --> 00:35:14.590
<v Speaker 4>That's very strong.</v>

1387
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:15.520
<v Speaker 4>Those are strong words.</v>

1388
00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:17.440
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what the fuck is going to happen?</v>

1389
00:35:17.441 --> 00:35:21.610
<v Speaker 4>That's what I say I say could be some sort of a meteor impact or it could be</v>

1390
00:35:21.611 --> 00:35:23.050
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a sky net thing.</v>

1391
00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.900
<v Speaker 4>I do believe that something is absolutely going to happen.</v>

1392
00:35:25.901 --> 00:35:30.370
<v Speaker 4>It's just seems to me that things are moving at such a furious pace that it just</v>

1393
00:35:30.371 --> 00:35:31.420
<v Speaker 4>can't last.</v>

1394
00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.670
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's a natural cycle,</v>

1395
00:35:33.671 --> 00:35:33.970
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1396
00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:34.571
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>

1397
00:35:34.571 --> 00:35:37.210
<v Speaker 4>I think the reason why we're having all these natural disasters,</v>

1398
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.850
<v Speaker 4>that's a part of a natural cycle too.</v>

1399
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:39.081
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1400
00:35:39.081 --> 00:35:42.680
<v Speaker 3>But if you talk to my grandpa grandfather about TVs will take it.</v>

1401
00:35:42.681 --> 00:35:43.461
<v Speaker 3>Like he was like,</v>

1402
00:35:43.461 --> 00:35:43.731
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1403
00:35:43.731 --> 00:35:44.501
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>

1404
00:35:44.501 --> 00:35:45.470
<v Speaker 3>Who TV was invented.</v>

1405
00:35:45.471 --> 00:35:46.580
<v Speaker 3>You can see TV were,</v>

1406
00:35:46.581 --> 00:35:47.350
<v Speaker 3>you know it's,</v>

1407
00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:47.961
<v Speaker 3>they probably,</v>

1408
00:35:47.961 --> 00:35:51.410
<v Speaker 3>it's just us living our life and then during around a certain age where we grow</v>

1409
00:35:51.411 --> 00:35:52.820
<v Speaker 3>up to a certain point where we're like,</v>

1410
00:35:52.821 --> 00:35:53.031
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1411
00:35:53.031 --> 00:35:54.620
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking spinning out of control.</v>

1412
00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.710
<v Speaker 3>That is back in the forties it's probably like Charlie Chaplin thought it was</v>

1413
00:35:57.711 --> 00:35:58.360
<v Speaker 3>spinning out of</v>

1414
00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.380
<v Speaker 4>that is possible,</v>

1415
00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:01.870
<v Speaker 4>but it also could be that human beings,</v>

1416
00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:05.500
<v Speaker 4>even though we love to think of ourselves as being separate from all the other</v>

1417
00:36:05.501 --> 00:36:06.580
<v Speaker 4>things in this world,</v>

1418
00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:11.820
<v Speaker 4>we are a natural thing and even though we have plastic fucking cars and glass</v>

1419
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:16.020
<v Speaker 4>lenses for fucking cell phones even,</v>

1420
00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:20.830
<v Speaker 4>we are still a natural thing and we are subject to the natural cycles of this</v>

1421
00:36:20.831 --> 00:36:21.131
<v Speaker 4>earth,</v>

1422
00:36:21.131 --> 00:36:23.770
<v Speaker 4>of this super organism of the universe itself.</v>

1423
00:36:23.771 --> 00:36:26.800
<v Speaker 4>And even when we see crazy weather patterns and wild,</v>

1424
00:36:26.801 --> 00:36:27.520
<v Speaker 4>crazy shit,</v>

1425
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:31.960
<v Speaker 4>there could easily also be crazy cultural patterns and that culture,</v>

1426
00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:34.900
<v Speaker 4>even though we can create it and we do have control of it,</v>

1427
00:36:34.901 --> 00:36:39.820
<v Speaker 4>it may be very well a natural movement as natural as your evolution from baby to</v>

1428
00:36:39.821 --> 00:36:40.654
<v Speaker 4>adulthood.</v>

1429
00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:41.800
<v Speaker 4>It could be a natural,</v>

1430
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.450
<v Speaker 3>it could be what we've published.</v>

1431
00:36:43.451 --> 00:36:44.284
<v Speaker 3>Some uh,</v>

1432
00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:45.491
<v Speaker 3>could,</v>

1433
00:36:45.491 --> 00:36:46.020
<v Speaker 3>we will be,</v>

1434
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.380
<v Speaker 3>make me want to fucking choke of it.</v>

1435
00:36:47.381 --> 00:36:48.214
<v Speaker 3>That's a good one.</v>

1436
00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:49.723
<v Speaker 3>On the West Mag,</v>

1437
00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.770
<v Speaker 3>it's a shirt at web magazine that I run reality Sandwich and we've been</v>

1438
00:36:53.771 --> 00:36:56.080
<v Speaker 3>publishing some excerpt which is not mac friendly by the way.</v>

1439
00:36:56.081 --> 00:36:56.771
<v Speaker 3>I want you to know that.</v>

1440
00:36:56.771 --> 00:36:58.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know that both of these computers,</v>

1441
00:36:58.901 --> 00:37:03.100
<v Speaker 3>I tried to go to your website today and just search my name obviously first,</v>

1442
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:06.400
<v Speaker 3>but then Joe Rogan's name and both of them kept on crashing.</v>

1443
00:37:06.401 --> 00:37:07.950
<v Speaker 3>My browser crashed my browser.</v>

1444
00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:08.200
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1445
00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.033
<v Speaker 3>I've never had that problem.</v>

1446
00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:10.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know Google chrome.</v>

1447
00:37:10.331 --> 00:37:10.940
<v Speaker 3>Check it out.</v>

1448
00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.620
<v Speaker 4>Just one of those old Max with a track ball.</v>

1449
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.921
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1450
00:37:12.921 --> 00:37:16.130
<v Speaker 4>I used to new Mac track balls anyway,</v>

1451
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.110
<v Speaker 4>published a few pieces by a German scientists.</v>

1452
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:18.920
<v Speaker 4>I did our brows,</v>

1453
00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.580
<v Speaker 4>wrote a book called Revolution 2012 and he's one of a bunch of people who are</v>

1454
00:37:22.581 --> 00:37:24.320
<v Speaker 4>arguing that a lot of what's happening,</v>

1455
00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:28.220
<v Speaker 4>it has to do with changes that are taking place throughout the whole solar</v>

1456
00:37:28.221 --> 00:37:29.980
<v Speaker 4>system to have to do with the sun changing it.</v>

1457
00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:33.530
<v Speaker 4>Actually the electromagnetic environment of the earth is shifting what is</v>

1458
00:37:33.531 --> 00:37:37.250
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be a galactic alignment on December 21st,</v>

1459
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:40.390
<v Speaker 4>2012 because I've heard Neil Tyson who I very much respect who is that?</v>

1460
00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.150
<v Speaker 4>Who it,</v>

1461
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.983
<v Speaker 4>he's a scientist,</v>

1462
00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.580
<v Speaker 4>a very famous internet scientist that sign,</v>

1463
00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.550
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't say gain wrestler.</v>

1464
00:37:46.551 --> 00:37:47.270
<v Speaker 4>He's a fucking,</v>

1465
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:49.820
<v Speaker 4>he's a scholar of a very well respected,</v>

1466
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.640
<v Speaker 4>I believe he's an astrophysicist or something along those lines,</v>

1467
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:53.481
<v Speaker 4>but super,</v>

1468
00:37:53.481 --> 00:37:54.530
<v Speaker 4>super brilliant guy.</v>

1469
00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.390
<v Speaker 4>He Poo pooed that there was any alignment whatsoever.</v>

1470
00:37:56.391 --> 00:37:57.530
<v Speaker 4>You said it's a constant thing.</v>

1471
00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.120
<v Speaker 4>That alignment,</v>

1472
00:37:59.121 --> 00:38:00.650
<v Speaker 4>that same alignment happens all the time.</v>

1473
00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:01.080
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1474
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:01.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1475
00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.220
<v Speaker 4>the fact that everyone's making it out to December 21st,</v>

1476
00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.770
<v Speaker 4>2012 was the first time that has happened in 25,000 years.</v>

1477
00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.041
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1478
00:38:07.041 --> 00:38:07.874
<v Speaker 4>that's nonsense.</v>

1479
00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:09.403
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>

1480
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:11.530
<v Speaker 4>I believe he knows more than I do,</v>

1481
00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.890
<v Speaker 4>probably know for sure.</v>

1482
00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:14.010
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1483
00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:14.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1484
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.360
<v Speaker 4>I can just give you my little meditation.</v>

1485
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:16.761
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1486
00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:17.594
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1487
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:20.270
<v Speaker 4>my understanding is that it's simply an obstacle alignment,</v>

1488
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:20.571
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

1489
00:38:20.571 --> 00:38:23.510
<v Speaker 4>which means there's no particular reason that we would know of that would be</v>

1490
00:38:23.511 --> 00:38:24.344
<v Speaker 4>such a tremendous,</v>

1491
00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:29.410
<v Speaker 4>tremendous transformative thing where the winter solstice sun rises within the</v>

1492
00:38:29.631 --> 00:38:31.280
<v Speaker 4>dark rift at the center of the Milky Way.</v>

1493
00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.500
<v Speaker 4>So in a sense,</v>

1494
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.410
<v Speaker 4>it's an eclipse of the center of the Milky Way by the,</v>

1495
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.740
<v Speaker 4>by the sun on the winter solstice on that particular date.</v>

1496
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:39.140
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1497
00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.140
<v Speaker 4>so that date had a lot of significance for them.</v>

1498
00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:45.610
<v Speaker 4>It was like the key moment in the year and they considered the son to be the</v>

1499
00:38:45.611 --> 00:38:49.000
<v Speaker 4>first father and they saw the dark rift at the center of the Milky Way as the</v>

1500
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:49.990
<v Speaker 4>cosmic mother,</v>

1501
00:38:49.991 --> 00:38:52.120
<v Speaker 4>or they also called it apparently a black hole.</v>

1502
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:55.420
<v Speaker 4>Which is interesting because only in the last like 15 years that are astronomers</v>

1503
00:38:55.421 --> 00:38:58.450
<v Speaker 4>discover there is a huge black hole to center of the Milky Way.</v>

1504
00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:01.960
<v Speaker 4>Also know that there's actually a supermassive black hole and his son are of</v>

1505
00:39:01.961 --> 00:39:02.950
<v Speaker 4>every single galaxy,</v>

1506
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.670
<v Speaker 4>and that that supermassive black hole is one half of 1% of a mass of every</v>

1507
00:39:06.671 --> 00:39:07.360
<v Speaker 4>galaxy.</v>

1508
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.950
<v Speaker 4>So if you have a giant galaxy,</v>

1509
00:39:08.951 --> 00:39:10.180
<v Speaker 4>it's a much bigger black hole.</v>

1510
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.420
<v Speaker 4>And they even have the first photograph they've ever taken of a black hole</v>

1511
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:14.590
<v Speaker 4>eating a black hole.</v>

1512
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.450
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking crazy.</v>
