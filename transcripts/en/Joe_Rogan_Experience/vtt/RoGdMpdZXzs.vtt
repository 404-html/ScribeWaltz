00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.913
<v Speaker 1>Bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.873
<v Speaker 2>Well we've tried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've tried other online interventions </v>

3
00:00:06.291 --> 00:00:08.600
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I have my these youtube videos up,</v>

4
00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:09.434
<v Speaker 2>but we also designed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work with some corporations awhile </v>

5
00:00:12.551 --> 00:00:13.384
<v Speaker 2>while back because I've done some </v>
<v Speaker 2>consulting and I had designed tests to </v>

6
00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:21.110
<v Speaker 2>help people hire better employees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I still do and in fact I work with</v>

7
00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:21.944
<v Speaker 2>this company up in California called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>founder institute and it's the world's </v>

8
00:00:24.711 --> 00:00:27.650
<v Speaker 2>largest stage early technology company </v>
<v Speaker 2>incubator.</v>

9
00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:28.484
<v Speaker 2>It's created 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies in the last four years and we </v>

10
00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:32.024
<v Speaker 2>test now in 135 cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I was marketing these tests to </v>

11
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:37.664
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kept asking me what could be done </v>

12
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:41.960
<v Speaker 2>about their poorer performing employees </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

13
00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:44.540
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know because it's not that easy</v>

14
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:47.060
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have someone who's problematic,</v>

15
00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:47.894
<v Speaker 2>who's troubled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that easy for a manager to </v>

16
00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:52.880
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to straighten them out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just don't have the time.</v>

17
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.893
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the manpower and they </v>

18
00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:56.930
<v Speaker 2>don't have the training usually to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

19
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.333
<v Speaker 2>But I designed to set of programs called</v>
<v Speaker 2>the self authoring suite and one of </v>

20
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:02.534
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The future authoring program helps </v>

21
00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:04.874
<v Speaker 2>people write out a plan for their life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it helps them to ask you some </v>

22
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:10.250
<v Speaker 2>questions about six dimensions of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

23
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:11.840
<v Speaker 2>You know your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your health,</v>

24
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 2>mental and physical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your use of drugs and alcohol,</v>

25
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.260
<v Speaker 2>your wishes three to five years down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>road for intimate relationships,</v>

26
00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:19.490
<v Speaker 2>for family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for career,</v>

27
00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:20.810
<v Speaker 2>for education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

28
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.003
<v Speaker 2>It asks you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what could your life be like three to </v>

29
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:24.584
<v Speaker 2>five years down the road?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you set it up for you like you were </v>

30
00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:27.794
<v Speaker 2>someone you were taking care of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it asks you those six questions that </v>

31
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.320
<v Speaker 2>it asks you to write for 15 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>about about your vision for your life.</v>

32
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.870
<v Speaker 2>You get to have what you want and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be good for you.</v>

33
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.943
<v Speaker 2>What would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it asks you to write for 15 </v>

34
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:45.680
<v Speaker 2>minutes about what your life would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like three to five years down the road.</v>

35
00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:46.514
<v Speaker 2>If you let your bad habits and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiocies in your foolishness is in your </v>

36
00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:51.440
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the upper hand in,</v>

37
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:53.840
<v Speaker 2>Auger you into the ground because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows about that.</v>

38
00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:54.674
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like you get to design the </v>
<v Speaker 2>little heaven to strive for and little </v>

39
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 2>hell to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you write for.</v>

40
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Then you basically turned that into an </v>
<v Speaker 2>implementable plan.</v>

41
00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:07.220
<v Speaker 2>That's the second part of the program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've used that with about 5,005</v>

42
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:10.340
<v Speaker 2>to 7,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>university students now mostly in Europe</v>

43
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:11.174
<v Speaker 2>at the Rotterdam School of management.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've raised their grade point </v>

44
00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:15.014
<v Speaker 2>average of their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty five percent drop their dropout </v>

45
00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:17.774
<v Speaker 2>rate the same and it's had a walloping </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect on men and on non Western ethnic </v>

46
00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:23.114
<v Speaker 2>minorities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's moved the nonwestern ethnic </v>

47
00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:30.041
<v Speaker 2>minority student population performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>at Rotterdam,</v>

48
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:32.750
<v Speaker 2>School of Management from 70 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>below the,</v>

49
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 2>the average to above the female Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

50
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.813
<v Speaker 2>natives.</v>

51
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.850
<v Speaker 2>And so the other reason I'm telling you </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

52
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.740
<v Speaker 2>apart from the fact that it's a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>good program.</v>

53
00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:44.200
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

54
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.443
<v Speaker 2>we did it at Mohawk college in Canada a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year ago and we dropped their dropout </v>

55
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:50.510
<v Speaker 2>rate in the first semester,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 percent,</v>

56
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.613
<v Speaker 2>and that especially again worked well </v>
<v Speaker 2>for men because men are at more risk of </v>

57
00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:54.944
<v Speaker 2>dropping out now and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially for men who didn't have </v>

58
00:02:56.601 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 2>good grades in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not only is there the possibility for</v>

59
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 2>the net to provide tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissemination of intellectual material,</v>

60
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:07.024
<v Speaker 2>but there's also the possibility for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>net to provide dissemination of </v>

61
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.643
<v Speaker 2>psychological interventions that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>major impacts on people's mental health </v>

62
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 2>and productivity at almost at </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily low cost.</v>

63
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 2>So that's really been fun too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why think providing some that sort of</v>

64
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:24.514
<v Speaker 2>a structure and a framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving people the tools just inform of </v>

65
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 2>asking them questions.</v>

66
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 2>What would you like to do is describe </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

67
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 2>what is your view?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you do that,</v>

68
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:35.314
<v Speaker 2>you sort of allow them to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves outline what they would like </v>

69
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 2>to accomplish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which most people don't do.</v>

70
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our education system,</v>

71
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.533
<v Speaker 2>our education system was designed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago in the late 18 hundreds to </v>

72
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:47.614
<v Speaker 2>produce factory workers because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>set up when when rural people were </v>

73
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 2>migrating to the cities on mass because </v>
<v Speaker 2>their kids,</v>

74
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:55.204
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're likely to get factory jobs and </v>

75
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 2>second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were working in factory,</v>

76
00:03:58.241 --> 00:03:59.074
<v Speaker 2>your kids needed to be taken care of and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the purpose of the schools was to </v>

77
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:02.824
<v Speaker 2>train factory workers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why everyone's lined up in </v>

78
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 2>rows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rows and why there are bells.</v>

79
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:08.314
<v Speaker 2>It's a factory model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that is that now </v>

80
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 2>people's careers basically have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>self determined,</v>

81
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 2>but that's never.</v>

82
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 2>That's never part of the education </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

83
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.283
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reason I developed these </v>
<v Speaker 2>programs was because I realized this is </v>

84
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 2>the same course where I'm teaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>students that if they would have been in</v>

85
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Germany in the 19 thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have been Nazis.</v>

86
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.353
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get them to design their </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives and it's way better to have </v>

87
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:32.974
<v Speaker 2>someone articulate their own plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You actually neurologically rewire </v>

88
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 2>people by having them formulate their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own thoughts,</v>

89
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 2>which is why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your school teachers used to say,</v>

90
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 2>put it in your own words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually very good advice.</v>

91
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:45.754
<v Speaker 2>If they would explain what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you have to conjure up the </v>

92
00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:50.800
<v Speaker 2>thoughts and you have to articulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

93
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:53.500
<v Speaker 2>then they change you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>

94
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so this program has had the,</v>

95
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

96
00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:59.763
<v Speaker 2>the effects have been absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming for us as researchers </v>

97
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:03.454
<v Speaker 2>because it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to produce an </v>

98
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 2>intervention that actually has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive effect on people,</v>

99
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:09.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hope it does,</v>

100
00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:11.110
<v Speaker 2>but generally when you test it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

101
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't do what you thought it did.</v>

102
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Or sometimes it even has the reverse </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>

103
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 2>That sounds fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

104
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 2>how do people have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can someone,</v>

105
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.510
<v Speaker 2>a regular person have access to this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called self authoring.</v>

106
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 2>So that's s e l,</v>
<v Speaker 2>f authoring,</v>

107
00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like writing a book,</v>

108
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:30.610
<v Speaker 2>self authoring Dotcom and the programs I</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave away the future authoring program,</v>

109
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 2>I think it might still be free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

110
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

111
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:35.014
<v Speaker 2>it is until the end of November.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a video called message to </v>

112
00:05:37.241 --> 00:05:41.410
<v Speaker 2>millennials were because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things Jonathan Heit said about,</v>

113
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he called Karl Marx,</v>

114
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 2>the patron saint of the social justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>warriors and John Stuart Mill,</v>

115
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 2>that patron saint of people say who </v>
<v Speaker 2>stood for objective truth and freedom of</v>

116
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 2>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought that was really smart.</v>

117
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:54.964
<v Speaker 2>He said Brown university is number one </v>
<v Speaker 2>for social justice universities in </v>

118
00:05:58.581 --> 00:05:59.414
<v Speaker 2>Chicago for truth universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that marks has </v>

119
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:04.574
<v Speaker 2>over John Stuart mill is that mark's is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a social revolutionary and young people </v>

120
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 2>like to think about ways to change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

121
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.083
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually a positive part of </v>

122
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:12.854
<v Speaker 2>their development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a stage that the developmental </v>

123
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:15.464
<v Speaker 2>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sean Piaget called the messianic stage </v>

124
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:19.310
<v Speaker 2>and he associated that with late </v>
<v Speaker 2>adolescence.</v>

125
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.443
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while young people want to change the </v>

126
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:22.850
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is,</v>

127
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:27.050
<v Speaker 2>is that that's been harnessed into </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempts to change other people,</v>

128
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.600
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't what you should do if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to change the world,</v>

129
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:30.434
<v Speaker 2>you should change yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean that in some cliched </v>

130
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:33.044
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it in the sense that Alexander </v>

131
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn said when he analyzed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union,</v>

132
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:38.234
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be thinking that the line that </v>

133
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 2>divides good from evil runs down </v>
<v Speaker 2>political spectrum or,</v>

134
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or countries or something like that.</v>

135
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:46.904
<v Speaker 2>It runs down right down the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your soul and if you want to sort out </v>

136
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 2>the world and what you do is you sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself out.</v>

137
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a serious business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

138
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.993
<v Speaker 2>They say it's more difficult to rule </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself than to rule a city and that's </v>

139
00:06:58.821 --> 00:06:59.654
<v Speaker 2>the truth because you're a complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are horrible monsters inside </v>

140
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:06.100
<v Speaker 2>of you that needed to be tamed and to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to be brought in,</v>

141
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.610
<v Speaker 2>to be brought into alignment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>submission so that you can be a powerful</v>

142
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:11.444
<v Speaker 2>and useful person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I gave away the future authoring </v>

143
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:15.644
<v Speaker 2>program as part of this video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made suggesting to millennials that </v>

144
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:22.850
<v Speaker 2>instead of rushing out there to change </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world by changing other bad people,</v>

145
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 2>that they should look inward and sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves out properly.</v>

146
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:26.890
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

147
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 2>I think we've given away about four or </v>
<v Speaker 2>5,000</v>

148
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:33.020
<v Speaker 2>of those programs so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about free till the end of November</v>

149
00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:34.760
<v Speaker 2>and then what happens with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

150
00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:35.594
<v Speaker 2>the self or the future authoring program</v>
<v Speaker 2>is regularly $14 and ninety five cents </v>

151
00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:41.420
<v Speaker 2>and the whole self authoring suite which</v>
<v Speaker 2>involves.</v>

152
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.553
<v Speaker 2>It's a program that helps you write an </v>
<v Speaker 2>autobiography so it helps you sort out </v>

153
00:07:44.991 --> 00:07:47.150
<v Speaker 2>things about your past that are still </v>
<v Speaker 2>burdening you.</v>

154
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.170
<v Speaker 2>You can tell a if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a memory that's more than 18</v>

155
00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:52.004
<v Speaker 2>months old approximately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you pull that memory up to </v>

156
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.770
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you still have an emotional reaction,</v>

157
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.970
<v Speaker 2>that means you haven't fully articulated</v>
<v Speaker 2>the memory,</v>

158
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.790
<v Speaker 2>you haven't analyzed it causally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't.</v>

159
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.773
<v Speaker 2>You haven't freed yourself from its </v>
<v Speaker 2>grasp and you're carrying it like a </v>

160
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:09.464
<v Speaker 2>weight and your brain responds to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the more have more weight you're </v>

161
00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:18.230
<v Speaker 2>carrying like that more baggage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say the more of the stress Hormone</v>

162
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Cortisol your brain produces and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cortisol makes you old.</v>

163
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.100
<v Speaker 2>Some of the work has been done by James </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pennebaker at the University of Texas at</v>

164
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:25.934
<v Speaker 2>Austin because he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started to pioneer these sorts of </v>

165
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:32.330
<v Speaker 2>writing programs and he found that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>people wrote about uncertain things,</v>

166
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.433
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>present or future so they could be </v>

167
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:36.650
<v Speaker 2>traumatic things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could be uncertain,</v>

168
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:39.200
<v Speaker 2>things that their physical health </v>
<v Speaker 2>improved and he.</v>

169
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.790
<v Speaker 2>He did a lot of detailed research trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out why that was and basically</v>

170
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:44.624
<v Speaker 2>came down to the explanation that it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like an uncertainty reduction </v>

171
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:49.634
<v Speaker 2>mechanism at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because your brain is always figuring </v>

172
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:53.420
<v Speaker 2>out how well situated are you in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

173
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 2>How much do you not know to how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>have you mastered?</v>

174
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 2>And you can tell that you've mastered </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

175
00:08:58.921 --> 00:08:59.754
<v Speaker 2>Because when you go somewhere and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>act things turn out the way you want </v>

176
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an indication of mastery and your</v>

177
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:05.844
<v Speaker 2>brain is sort of keeping track across </v>
<v Speaker 2>your whole life of how many places </v>

178
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 2>you've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where things haven't worked out compared</v>

179
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:13.980
<v Speaker 2>to how many places you have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they have worked out.</v>

180
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.790
<v Speaker 2>And if all those places in your past </v>
<v Speaker 2>where things haven't worked out,</v>

181
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:18.624
<v Speaker 2>you need to map and master and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That decreases the existential load on </v>

182
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:25.170
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

183
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 2>But that actually decreases your </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychophysiological load,</v>

184
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.450
<v Speaker 2>it makes you healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes you less stress,</v>

185
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 2>and so we've put all that together in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this self authoring suite to help people</v>

186
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:36.990
<v Speaker 2>write about their past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sort it out in a,</v>

187
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 2>in a detailed autobiography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it asks you questions about your past,</v>

188
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:40.704
<v Speaker 2>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>divide your life up into six epochs and </v>

189
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:46.150
<v Speaker 2>then divide each of those that might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

190
00:09:46.151 --> 00:09:46.984
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>birth to kindergarten and then maybe </v>

191
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:51.630
<v Speaker 2>elementary school and then maybe junior </v>
<v Speaker 2>high school however you want to do it.</v>

192
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.763
<v Speaker 2>And then to write about the emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant events in each of those </v>

193
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.353
<v Speaker 2>epochs and then to describe their </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects on you and then to analyze how </v>

194
00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 2>you did in those situations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you might have done differently,</v>

195
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:07.710
<v Speaker 2>what you might do differently in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future to straighten out your past.</v>

196
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:08.873
<v Speaker 2>And I've done that with my students in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my maps of meaning class for about the </v>

197
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:11.850
<v Speaker 2>last 10 years.</v>

198
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.070
<v Speaker 2>And some people have written 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>

199
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not that uncommon for students to </v>
<v Speaker 2>write 15,000</v>

200
00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:19.140
<v Speaker 2>words and their autobiography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

201
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.033
<v Speaker 2>So that's such great advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's such great advice about </v>

202
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:23.544
<v Speaker 2>reconciling with your past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because so many people just carry it </v>

203
00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:25.861
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

204
00:10:25.861 --> 00:10:26.370
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're.</v>

205
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.203
<v Speaker 2>If you're thinking about your past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it means is you haven't analyzed </v>

206
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:33.330
<v Speaker 2>the causal chains because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

207
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.000
<v Speaker 2>why do you remember your past?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you might say,</v>

208
00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:36.834
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in order to have an objective </v>

209
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.293
<v Speaker 2>record of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it has nothing to do with </v>

210
00:10:40.441 --> 00:10:42.480
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only one reason you remember the</v>

211
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:45.540
<v Speaker 2>past and that's to be prepared for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

212
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:47.003
<v Speaker 2>That's why you remember the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what you're supposed to do is </v>

213
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:50.363
<v Speaker 2>take the past and extract out from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wisdom and wisdom is the ability to </v>

214
00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:59.100
<v Speaker 2>avoid stumbling blindly into ditches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you think,</v>

215
00:10:59.101 --> 00:11:01.050
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a time in my past,</v>

216
00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:01.884
<v Speaker 2>I stumbled blindly into this horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>ditch and terrible things happened to </v>

217
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:04.710
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

218
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:05.543
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

219
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:06.803
<v Speaker 2>you need to take that apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to figure out how was it that </v>

220
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.463
<v Speaker 2>that events conspired with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>participation voluntarily or </v>

221
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:18.270
<v Speaker 2>involuntarily so that that terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences emerged.</v>

222
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.133
<v Speaker 2>You need to know why that happened and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how you could react differently in that </v>

223
00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:24.270
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as you do that,</v>

224
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.093
<v Speaker 2>your brain will leave it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't obsess you about it anymore </v>

225
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.973
<v Speaker 2>because the anxiety producing parts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain are basically trying to tell </v>

226
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:34.830
<v Speaker 2>you where there are obstacles in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

227
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.753
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look out.</v>

228
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Don't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't go there.</v>

229
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:38.543
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

230
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.470
<v Speaker 2>don't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's fire.</v>

231
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could master the fire,</v>

232
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're a wielder of fire.</v>

233
00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:46.494
<v Speaker 2>You're not just a victim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and lots of situations are dangerous or </v>

234
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:52.860
<v Speaker 2>not dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on your level of mastery,</v>

235
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life is like that.</v>

236
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.593
<v Speaker 2>And so a negative emotion that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with a memory is something </v>

237
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:03.250
<v Speaker 2>that's crying out for mastery and </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing can really help with that.</v>

238
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.690
<v Speaker 2>So you're reorganizing your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you write autobiographically,</v>

239
00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.570
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're basically the emotions.</v>

240
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Imagine emotion memories can be stored </v>
<v Speaker 2>at different levels of your brain,</v>

241
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:15.643
<v Speaker 2>some sort of primordial reptilian image </v>
<v Speaker 2>laden areas that are very emotional opt </v>

242
00:12:21.271 --> 00:12:25.390
<v Speaker 2>to finally articulated plans for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>future life.</v>

243
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:26.523
<v Speaker 2>Will you want to take everything that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative and emotional and transform </v>

244
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:34.480
<v Speaker 2>that into a fully articulated vision for</v>
<v Speaker 2>your future.</v>

245
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:35.403
<v Speaker 2>And that frees you of your past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be thinking about your </v>

246
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:38.644
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe if you're 80 and you know </v>

247
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:42.790
<v Speaker 2>you're going over a well spent life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole different thing,</v>

248
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.040
<v Speaker 2>but if you're 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>35 or 20,</v>

249
00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:47.200
<v Speaker 2>and most of the time you're thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about your past,</v>

250
00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's like your soul is trapped</v>
<v Speaker 2>back there and you need to.</v>

251
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.263
<v Speaker 2>You need to free it through </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation and the metaphysical </v>

252
00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:57.580
<v Speaker 2>language is appropriate because that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sense what you're doing.</v>

253
00:12:57.581 --> 00:12:58.414
<v Speaker 2>You're trapped in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you've got to break free of </v>

254
00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:02.980
<v Speaker 2>that so you can use all your resources </v>
<v Speaker 2>to move ahead into the future.</v>
