<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.500
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

3
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>pros,</v>

4
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.760
<v Speaker 1>professional players,</v>

5
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.391
<v Speaker 1>what do you have to learn?</v>

6
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:22.224
<v Speaker 1>Like what are the principles?</v>

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.441
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>you can learn the fundamentals,</v>

9
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>like how to kind of stand the right way to hit a ball.</v>

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>But learning how to do things,</v>

11
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>we'll look all like learning how to move the ball correctly.</v>

12
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Like shot like this.</v>

13
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Most people have no idea where I'm going to get from there to the four ball.</v>

14
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>So I want to get out of here.</v>

15
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.220
<v Speaker 1>You have to hit the four bolts,</v>

16
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.871
<v Speaker 1>the four balls,</v>

17
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:46.704
<v Speaker 1>next</v>

18
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.440
<v Speaker 1>three after three.</v>

19
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get into position for the forest.</v>

20
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>So I hit it flat so it slides out.</v>

21
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't just do that,</v>

22
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:04.120
<v Speaker 1>but I also took a steamer.</v>

23
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.143
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>but like now when I make a shot,</v>

25
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I always am setting myself up for the next shot.</v>

26
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>So everything's about angles.</v>

27
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:17.034
<v Speaker 1>It's all geometry.</v>

28
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>It's all about you don't want to be over here.</v>

29
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>You want to be able to hear because the natural progression is here to slide</v>

30
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>down here for this ball.</v>

31
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>So when I hit this ball,</v>

32
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 1>you're going to hit that pink ball into that pocket.</v>

33
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

34
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.380
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

35
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>so now I'm not thinking about that.</v>

36
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:32.094
<v Speaker 1>That's easy.</v>

37
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>What's important is getting in a good position for this ball and just speaking,</v>

38
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.170
<v Speaker 1>you got to hit that ball there.</v>

39
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Right there around there,</v>

40
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:39.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

41
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Well I have to hit it exactly right here because that's the only way you're</v>

42
00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:44.704
<v Speaker 1>gonna make it.</v>

43
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>And then you draw a line to where the ball is.</v>

44
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Where the book,</v>

45
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.671
<v Speaker 1>well there's a lot of,</v>

46
00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:52.090
<v Speaker 1>it's instinctive cause I understand where the contact point is and I'm going to</v>

47
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.110
<v Speaker 1>hit it with English.</v>

48
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Which puts are the 10 side you went with was lefthand English on it.</v>

49
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.743
<v Speaker 1>Spinach.</v>

50
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

51
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh and we're dessert.</v>

52
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.643
<v Speaker 1>Bananas.</v>

53
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that?</v>

55
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:09.070
<v Speaker 1>See how the shots I can,</v>

56
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.303
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

57
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do now?</v>

58
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk at that and get in position this.</v>

59
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

60
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Talking about,</v>

61
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.301
<v Speaker 1>and that corner could that,</v>

62
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:17.601
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

63
00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:18.434
<v Speaker 1>that feels like it's,</v>

64
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.100
<v Speaker 1>but the most important thing is getting out of here.</v>

65
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.680
<v Speaker 1>It's about getting out of here for the side pocket.</v>

66
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.210
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck because no,</v>

67
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to hit it just wipes on.</v>

68
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard stock season.</v>

69
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.060
<v Speaker 1>This is what's important getting here,</v>

70
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.410
<v Speaker 1>but not just here but down people.</v>

71
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Cause I gotta go back up to the seven.</v>

72
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Can't be updatable because then you've got to do all this.</v>

73
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Now you want to hit that,</v>

74
00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>that white ball you want to get in position where,</v>

75
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>where do you want to stop them ball.</v>

76
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>So I want to make sure that I have an angle on a seven ball.</v>

77
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:58.401
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit it low and just slide north says lie.</v>

78
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>That's impressive.</v>

79
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:03.784
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

80
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>So now from here,</v>

81
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.970
<v Speaker 1>this is for easy.</v>

82
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>My only concern is I don't get stuck behind the 10 ball.</v>

83
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>I get stuck behind a 10 ball,</v>

84
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>then I don't have a shot at the eight.</v>

85
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>So I want to play towards the danger zone,</v>

86
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 1>which is like this side rail.</v>

87
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.950
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to a,</v>

88
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to scratch,</v>

89
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to get stuck behind 10</v>

90
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 1>see how close I am?</v>

91
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Ooh Myself,</v>

92
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.813
<v Speaker 1>I can't see it.</v>

93
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>But I was worried about that.</v>

94
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>I really wanted to land like right here,</v>

95
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.650
<v Speaker 1>telling them,</v>

96
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.483
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

97
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>If I see like that kind of position,</v>

98
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>that takes fucking years to learn how to do,</v>

99
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.463
<v Speaker 1>to learn how,</v>

100
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>how hard you're supposed to be hitting the ball to make it react like that.</v>

101
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.460
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have a,</v>

102
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>that kind of pinpoint precision,</v>

103
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.360
<v Speaker 1>that ability to manipulate.</v>

104
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 1>And so pros will run like two tails at a time.</v>

105
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Three to the best guys can throw 10,</v>

106
00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.271
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

107
00:03:58.271 --> 00:03:58.490
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>

108
00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Especially in practice when there's no money on the line,</v>

110
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.871
<v Speaker 1>it's just nothing.</v>

111
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 1>They're just having a good time.</v>

112
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

113
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>They can run the fucking 10 racks and crazy shit.</v>

114
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I've run for broken run four racks in a room of nine ball,</v>

115
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>which is way harder than enable</v>

116
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.471
<v Speaker 1>nine bosses.</v>

117
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:15.304
<v Speaker 1>No more money.</v>

118
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

119
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:17.140
<v Speaker 1>nine no nine ball is,</v>

120
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:17.974
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

121
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>is a rotation game.</v>

122
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 1>April you have a bunch of different choices.</v>

123
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.280
<v Speaker 1>You can choose to shoot any color or any solid or any stripe,</v>

124
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:27.154
<v Speaker 1>whether any solid,</v>

125
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 1>but whereas in a nine ball playing a rotation,</v>

126
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 1>so every shot,</v>

127
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>there's no options.</v>

128
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Salads or stripes.</v>

129
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.450
<v Speaker 1>You're nine ball is you're shooting the balls,</v>

130
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>one through nine,</v>

131
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.371
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

132
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:42.731
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

133
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:43.091
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

134
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:43.391
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

135
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:43.721
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

136
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:43.991
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

137
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:44.381
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

138
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:44.651
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

139
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:46.180
<v Speaker 1>nine you get the nine you went.</v>

140
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with a eight ball,</v>

141
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.951
<v Speaker 1>you're either saw,</v>

142
00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 1>odds are stripes and you'd get a lot more options.</v>

143
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>You can pick your shots.</v>

144
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.300
<v Speaker 1>It's still a very tough game,</v>

145
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's not nearly,</v>

146
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't require much ability to move the two ball.</v>

147
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 1>It's all about moving the cue ball.</v>

148
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Snick the last shot.</v>

149
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.010
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy table too.</v>

150
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>This isn't a regular table.</v>

151
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Like look,</v>

152
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even fit two balls in him.</v>

153
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.611
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

154
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:20.861
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

155
00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:21.730
<v Speaker 1>very tight table.</v>

156
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.620
<v Speaker 1>So this is a protein much anymore.</v>

157
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.360
<v Speaker 1>It's more tight.</v>

158
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Dynapro table pro tables,</v>

159
00:05:26.011 --> 00:05:27.010
<v Speaker 1>four and a half inches.</v>

160
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:28.560
<v Speaker 1>This table for practice.</v>

161
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

162
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Well it's like a table or for people that you know,</v>

163
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to any bullshit.</v>

164
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.150
<v Speaker 1>You don't want a ball to Bible in,</v>

165
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.160
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

166
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.650
<v Speaker 1>And if you didn't pick up golf,</v>

167
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Speaker 1>you would have never been scared.</v>

168
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:42.763
<v Speaker 1>Scared.</v>

169
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.410
<v Speaker 1>I saw too many people can.</v>

170
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 1>We saw too many people that picked up golf and then became fucking nuts.</v>

171
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Speaker 1>They would just play all day.</v>

172
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:51.071
<v Speaker 1>And it takes too much.</v>

173
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:51.970
<v Speaker 1>You've got down time.</v>

174
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Like you could go play pool for an hour.</v>

175
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 1>You can't play golf for an hour playing golf.</v>

176
00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>You're playing all day.</v>

177
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

178
00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like that shit.</v>

179
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 1>What's the top pool guy making Dennis a problem dog.</v>

180
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:04.694
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

181
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Even the number one guy in the world and no one guy in the world and I made a</v>

182
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>quarter million bucks</v>

183
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 1>and there's not that many of those guys travel</v>

184
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.100
<v Speaker 1>silent movies.</v>

185
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 1>So it's not applicable anymore.</v>

186
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

187
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>you're going to print something and put it out on a fucking piece of paper?</v>

188
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 3>Hadn't they lost whatever,</v>

189
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:27.470
<v Speaker 3>like remaining respect that happened.</v>

190
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 3>Then I lost when they publish this,</v>

191
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:29.774
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

192
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

193
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.600
<v Speaker 3>Article in their magazine or</v>

194
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 3>on Angel Wings and it was this like insane justification for how drones are more</v>

195
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 3>humane than other forms of warfare.</v>

196
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.160
<v Speaker 3>And it read like a PRP who paint like which defense contractor paid for this</v>

197
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 3>bullshit cause it's just totally demented.</v>

198
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.670
<v Speaker 1>How's the year to go?</v>

199
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

200
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.163
<v Speaker 1>That's um,</v>

201
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.240
<v Speaker 1>what would you say is right?</v>

202
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like you never know what's the source of the motivation to do a story.</v>

203
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:06.131
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

204
00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:11.131
<v Speaker 1>after you hear about Amba lions experience with CNN and that bar rain piece one</v>

205
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:12.460
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

206
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.600
<v Speaker 1>how much of that are going on?</v>

207
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.790
<v Speaker 1>How much of what we're seeing on television and reading in a newspaper is</v>

208
00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:20.620
<v Speaker 1>filtered through propaganda?</v>

209
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Probably quite a bit.</v>

210
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:30.791
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

211
00:07:30.791 --> 00:07:32.770
<v Speaker 3>I was watching part of the Kimmel last night.</v>

212
00:07:32.771 --> 00:07:33.640
<v Speaker 3>He had Johnny Depp,</v>

213
00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:36.940
<v Speaker 3>Vaughn sneaky about how that format is just,</v>

214
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.430
<v Speaker 3>that's what most people are consuming.</v>

215
00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:42.850
<v Speaker 3>And it's so weird because you have somebody there for five or six minutes.</v>

216
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.760
<v Speaker 3>They don't share anything that's important,</v>

217
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.020
<v Speaker 3>like you never see.</v>

218
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.770
<v Speaker 3>Even though I think Kim was the best late night,</v>

219
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:49.870
<v Speaker 3>I do too.</v>

220
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.770
<v Speaker 3>You never see like,</v>

221
00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:52.840
<v Speaker 3>so Johnny was the meaning of life.</v>

222
00:07:52.841 --> 00:07:55.100
<v Speaker 3>Like what should people try to do a nice view.</v>

223
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like meaningless bullshit that I've already forgotten or hadn't.</v>

224
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.230
<v Speaker 3>He flies back to the south of France or wherever he's from.</v>

225
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.040
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>

226
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.040
<v Speaker 3>Like you to promote his new movie and you don't learn anything more about what</v>

227
00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:10.540
<v Speaker 3>he believes about the world or politics.</v>

228
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.341
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>

229
00:08:12.341 --> 00:08:17.341
<v Speaker 3>It's like the whole format was created before the much better format that we</v>

230
00:08:19.631 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 3>have now.</v>

231
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

232
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 1>And then the whole commercials,</v>

233
00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:25.971
<v Speaker 1>what we're right back.</v>

234
00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Like where are you going</v>

235
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.920
<v Speaker 1>right there fucking talk to him.</v>

236
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone knows a conversation sort of ramps up like you have a</v>

237
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:36.351
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>

238
00:08:36.351 --> 00:08:39.750
<v Speaker 1>sit down and then you get loose and after a while and then you start really,</v>

239
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.040
<v Speaker 1>and it has a flow to it and that flows completely interrupted.</v>

240
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 1>If you start doing a commercial every seven minutes</v>

241
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.411
<v Speaker 3>or whatever it is,</v>

242
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:49.460
<v Speaker 3>we don't wait that format.</v>

243
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:53.190
<v Speaker 3>Campbell does a great job because you can tell that he's really smart and uh,</v>

244
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.143
<v Speaker 3>I watched her,</v>

245
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.670
<v Speaker 3>it's was like,</v>

246
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 3>he's not worried that he's going to lose his show or something.</v>

247
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.243
<v Speaker 3>He's nervous.</v>

248
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.400
<v Speaker 3>He's going to go overboard.</v>

249
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:02.471
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

250
00:09:02.471 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 3>something's going gonna just take it away.</v>

251
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

252
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 3>That's the feeling I get.</v>

253
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's just his personality,</v>

254
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:09.090
<v Speaker 3>but it's like you could go a lot further.</v>

255
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:10.110
<v Speaker 3>You can push things further.</v>

256
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:12.070
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to tell you though.</v>

257
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:12.511
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

258
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:14.010
<v Speaker 3>it's the fucking tonight show.</v>

259
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

260
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 3>I know he's not Jay Leno,</v>

261
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:17.760
<v Speaker 3>but it's still the tonight show.</v>

262
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.040
<v Speaker 3>People watching it now.</v>

263
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Half of them are probably watching it on youtube the next day.</v>

264
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:23.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

265
00:09:23.471 --> 00:09:27.630
<v Speaker 3>But doing all these things for this hypothetical old lady in the Midwest is</v>

266
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.260
<v Speaker 3>going to be offended by it and I think we're seeing is like less and less a</v>

267
00:09:32.261 --> 00:09:32.970
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

268
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Speaker 3>They're dying.</v>

269
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.433
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

270
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.440
<v Speaker 3>Basically another 90 now dynamic.</v>

271
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.470
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right in some ways,</v>

272
00:09:42.471 --> 00:09:45.020
<v Speaker 3>but the bottom line is their,</v>

273
00:09:45.021 --> 00:09:48.110
<v Speaker 3>their revenues directly related to their,</v>

274
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.473
<v Speaker 3>the ratings</v>

275
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.350
<v Speaker 3>and so thinking that oh most people are going to watch it on youtube.</v>

276
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.390
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't translate financially.</v>

277
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:57.703
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

278
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.000
<v Speaker 3>Still that's the main motivation was still the financial motivation.</v>

279
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean they look,</v>

280
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.330
<v Speaker 3>they look at those numbers where the fund we'll comb,</v>

281
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:07.803
<v Speaker 3>they um,</v>

282
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:14.700
<v Speaker 3>they have talking detailed by the minute analysis break down and somebody 10,000</v>

283
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.500
<v Speaker 3>when Kendall started talking about tomatoes,</v>

284
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.940
<v Speaker 3>people don't care about tomatoes,</v>

285
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.110
<v Speaker 3>don't talk about tomatoes,</v>

286
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.570
<v Speaker 3>but we dropped off 1%.</v>

287
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

288
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:26.853
<v Speaker 3>when you turn,</v>

289
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

290
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:27.531
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

291
00:10:27.531 --> 00:10:28.364
<v Speaker 3>they have that,</v>

292
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.820
<v Speaker 3>they have like these number being countered.</v>

293
00:10:30.821 --> 00:10:31.690
<v Speaker 3>Dude that's good.</v>

294
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.650
<v Speaker 3>Are really concerned about that stuff.</v>

295
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.713
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

296
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:37.871
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

297
00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:39.390
<v Speaker 3>Did they have that sort of an attitude?</v>

298
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:43.800
<v Speaker 3>But they do believe in some of the big youtube channels and friends with the guy</v>

299
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:47.190
<v Speaker 3>who was the head of production or it those until recently.</v>

300
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.570
<v Speaker 3>And he was telling me that they look at everything like the number of likes and</v>

301
00:10:51.571 --> 00:10:52.081
<v Speaker 3>dislikes,</v>

302
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:53.230
<v Speaker 3>and if it goes beyond</v>

303
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:59.190
<v Speaker 3>too many reds [inaudible] they'll just pull the video.</v>

304
00:10:59.280 --> 00:10:59.671
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

305
00:10:59.671 --> 00:11:00.360
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

306
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.240
<v Speaker 3>He said they don't want to fuck up their algorithm or whatever.</v>

307
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.040
<v Speaker 3>They want to continuously be on the top.</v>

308
00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:08.280
<v Speaker 3>So the video doesn't do as well as they expected to just get rid of it.</v>

309
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.880
<v Speaker 3>It's that rarely happens because they know so well with the audience wants at</v>

310
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:12.540
<v Speaker 3>this point.</v>

311
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.250
<v Speaker 3>What kind of videos do they make?</v>

312
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.290
<v Speaker 3>They do like music,</v>

313
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.153
<v Speaker 3>entertainment,</v>

314
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.420
<v Speaker 3>two minute long clips,</v>

315
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.340
<v Speaker 3>different discussions and stuff.</v>

316
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:21.743
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

317
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.793
<v Speaker 3>So that's fine.</v>

318
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:28.280
<v Speaker 3>But to me a long toss is even more ridiculous when I'm talking about real stuff.</v>

319
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:28.940
<v Speaker 3>It'll be like,</v>

320
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.000
<v Speaker 3>I need to know about,</v>

321
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

322
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:31.360
<v Speaker 3>the Harvard or something.</v>

323
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.630
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
