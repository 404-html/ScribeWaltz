1
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.261
<v Speaker 2>as we prayed,</v>

3
00:00:06.261 --> 00:00:10.400
<v Speaker 2>sadness that I tell you that this Joe Rogan experience is not brought to you by</v>

4
00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:11.234
<v Speaker 2>the fleshlight.</v>

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.460
<v Speaker 2>We've come to the end of our long road with the flashlight and they've been.</v>

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.140
<v Speaker 2>They were the first sponsor ever on the Joe Rogan experience podcast and we</v>

7
00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:22.370
<v Speaker 2>appreciate the fuck out of that.</v>

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.040
<v Speaker 2>They took a chance when we were on a laptop,</v>

9
00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 2>what snowflakes in the background,</v>

10
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.520
<v Speaker 2>and we did two hard years together and we hope to really hard years.</v>

11
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.090
<v Speaker 2>We hope that we sold you a lot of fake pussies.</v>

12
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 2>That's what we sincerely hope.</v>

13
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.630
<v Speaker 2>We hope that our relationship was profitable and we just want to say that you</v>

14
00:00:41.631 --> 00:00:46.631
<v Speaker 2>guys are cool as fuck and we enjoyed working with you and best of luck and all</v>

15
00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:51.470
<v Speaker 2>you do with your rubber pussies in the future if you have a solid product.</v>

16
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.860
<v Speaker 2>And it was an honor to represent you to the field of battle sharing this moment</v>

17
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.461
<v Speaker 2>of silence real quick.</v>

18
00:00:58.461 --> 00:00:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

19
00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Do what?</v>

20
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.640
<v Speaker 2>What mobile ready?</v>

21
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.241
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:05.074
<v Speaker 2>We're good.</v>

23
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.591
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

24
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:06.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

25
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.820
<v Speaker 2>we're not sponsored by alienware.</v>

26
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 2>People keep asking because we changed the laptops.</v>

27
00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:14.821
<v Speaker 2>We only are doing this because I think it's a good idea to support companies who</v>

28
00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:20.941
<v Speaker 2>support mma and alien ware to stepped up and they them and Dell.</v>

29
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.990
<v Speaker 2>That's a big deal.</v>

30
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.350
<v Speaker 2>When a company like alienware start sponsoring fighters.</v>

31
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I see that alien logo on fighters shorts,</v>

32
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.101
<v Speaker 2>that's a big deal.</v>

33
00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:30.341
<v Speaker 2>To me.</v>

34
00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:31.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's a big fucking company.</v>

35
00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:33.820
<v Speaker 2>Like an Anderson Silva was burger king.</v>

36
00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat burger king,</v>

37
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:35.890
<v Speaker 2>but if I was going to eat burger king,</v>

38
00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:38.110
<v Speaker 2>I would eat burger king because they sponsored Anderson Silva.</v>

39
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Not that Andersen needs it as much as like mma gets a lot of these fighters,</v>

40
00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:44.200
<v Speaker 2>what they get in,</v>

41
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.363
<v Speaker 2>how they get</v>

42
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 2>money for training and to pay for.</v>

43
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 2>It's not just their salaries from fighting,</v>

44
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 2>it's from their sponsors.</v>

45
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.300
<v Speaker 2>So if you see young guys and they're fighting,</v>

46
00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

47
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.250
<v Speaker 2>for 10,000 bucks or whatever it is,</v>

48
00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:57.670
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

49
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 2>You don't get paid a lot of money when nobody knows who you are.</v>

50
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 2>You get paid a lot of money when you can sell tickets.</v>

51
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 2>But what keeps these young guys going is,</v>

52
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.520
<v Speaker 2>especially companies like alienware,</v>

53
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 2>like really high profile companies,</v>

54
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 2>when they start putting the logos on your shorts,</v>

55
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.473
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

56
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 2>That means that there's a big company that's invested,</v>

57
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 2>there's a big company and it's stepping up.</v>

58
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.730
<v Speaker 2>I think that should be rewarded and that's why we decided to do this and we're,</v>

59
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 2>we're working with sucker punch entertainment and alienware MMA and they hooked</v>

60
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:31.400
<v Speaker 2>us up with some laptops and we're trying to support a company that supports mma.</v>

61
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

62
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 2>these are not cheap laptops.</v>

63
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:34.590
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking expensive,</v>

64
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 2>but they kick some serious ass if you want to play games on laptops,</v>

65
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.391
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

66
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 2>the shit.</v>

67
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.741
<v Speaker 2>And people are like,</v>

68
00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:42.060
<v Speaker 2>well you can make yourself for cheaper.</v>

69
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.050
<v Speaker 2>I maybe you could make a laptop,</v>

70
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you could buy shells for laptops and you can kind of do it,</v>

71
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going to make a fucking alien if you can afford it though.</v>

72
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 2>They are the shit.</v>

73
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean these,</v>

74
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.440
<v Speaker 2>the frame rates and these things are ridiculous.</v>

75
00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:56.730
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

76
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.870
<v Speaker 2>you watch full resolution on these things,</v>

77
00:02:59.871 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 2>but they're very fun when I'm using it.</v>

78
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Even Three d,</v>

79
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 2>which is a fucking trip when you're really,</v>

80
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:05.051
<v Speaker 2>really baked in,</v>

81
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 2>you want to play some games in three D in your bed.</v>

82
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

83
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

84
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 2>it's a very solid gaming laptop and we support them.</v>

85
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.370
<v Speaker 2>We support a alienware period for nothing for free or sort of sort of free shit</v>

86
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 2>and laptops.</v>

87
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.490
<v Speaker 2>Get a little money out of it.</v>

88
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

89
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

90
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 2>we are also sponsored by [inaudible] dot com.</v>

91
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 2>That's o n n I t,</v>

92
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 2>makers of Alpha brain.</v>

93
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 2>I haven't even mind yet.</v>

94
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:27.461
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

95
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting insecure now.</v>

96
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear that on it?</v>

97
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Rattle snake.</v>

98
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 2>Is that the onnit rattlesnake?</v>

99
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm Scott.</v>

100

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Just got battle ropes in the mail.</v>

102
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.060
<v Speaker 2>It'll tell me some of the time.</v>

103
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Your brain time to get caveman style in the backyard.</v>

104
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Scare the neighbors,</v>

105
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:44.644
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.663
<v Speaker 2>bitches know.</v>

107
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

108
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:48.660
<v Speaker 2>When you hear your neighbor to kettlebells in the backyard here,</v>

109
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.420
<v Speaker 2>that's dude like you probably not gonna wanna.</v>

110
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.273
<v Speaker 2>Invite that guy.</v>

111
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.153
<v Speaker 2>Barbecue.</v>

112
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.543
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Weirdo.</v>

113
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Especially human noise.</v>

114
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 2>You make me uncomfortable.</v>

115
00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Like when we go work out together,</v>

116
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 2>if you look,</v>

117
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 2>if you're working out correctly,</v>

118
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard,</v>

119
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

120
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 2>you gotta work out to the point where your body's failing to with a ball gag in</v>

121
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 2>her mouth and they basically have something like that.</v>

122
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 2>They have this thing called the training mask and a Bas rutten has one called</v>

123
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:15.874
<v Speaker 2>the boss.</v>

124
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.280
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the boss.</v>

125
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

126
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.693
<v Speaker 2>something or another.</v>

127
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 2>And it's um,</v>

128
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.190
<v Speaker 2>you breathe through it and it restricts your air.</v>

129
00:04:22.191 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 2>It gives you like tiny air holes to breathe,</v>

130
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:24.101
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

131
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:24.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

132
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:24.731
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

133
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:24.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

134
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Bas rutten's sits in your mouth kind of crazy,</v>

135
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 2>like this big giant mouthpiece and,</v>

136
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:29.350
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

137
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.671
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

138
00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 2>the other one,</v>

139
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.580
<v Speaker 2>the elevation mask is like,</v>

140
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.560
<v Speaker 2>it's got like little hoses on it and shit.</v>

141
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 2>And when boss routines and very controversial by the way,</v>

142
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 2>scientifically not really supported it's support,</v>

143
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 2>it's not really supported that that improves your oxygen and it doesn't,</v>

144
00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 2>it certainly doesn't do.</v>

145
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.500
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

146
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Taking capacity out training at altitude does,</v>

147
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 2>which training it to does is you live in a place and you stay overnight and</v>

148
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 2>sleep in a place where there's a very high altitude,</v>

149
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 2>very low oxygen,</v>

150
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.090
<v Speaker 2>your body naturally overproduces red blood cells to compensate for the lack of</v>

151
00:04:58.091 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 2>oxygen.</v>

152
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean that when you restrict your oxygen,</v>

153
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.760
<v Speaker 2>your body makes more red blood cells.</v>

154
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:04.990
<v Speaker 2>It just means it's harder to breathe.</v>

155
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

156
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a better workout,</v>

157
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:10.510
<v Speaker 2>but it's also kind of not a better workout because you're not able to work out</v>

158
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:12.280
<v Speaker 2>as hard because you can't breathe as hard,</v>

159
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

160
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 2>so unless you're an absolutely perfect shape,</v>

161
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.230
<v Speaker 2>the benefit of it is probably negligible.</v>

162
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck this has to do with anything,</v>

163
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.933
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

164
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.180
<v Speaker 2>that's why wouldn't work out with a ball gag that would love to hear you like</v>

165
00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:27.760
<v Speaker 2>doing your [inaudible].</v>

166
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Like when you don't have a ball gag in and you're working out,</v>

167
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:33.850
<v Speaker 2>it sounds sexual sounds really intense.</v>

168
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 2>No to everybody in the gym,</v>

169
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 2>like girls are like fucking like,</v>

170
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.451
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

171
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:37.790
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>

172
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Pushing out to the elliptical.</v>

173
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to do it,</v>

174
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 2>you should do it.</v>

175
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.621
<v Speaker 2>Guys are.</v>

176
00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:42.311
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to do it,</v>

177
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:42.851
<v Speaker 2>you should actually.</v>

178
00:05:42.851 --> 00:05:43.990
<v Speaker 2>I know I can't actually.</v>

179
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have a halfassed workout ever.</v>

180
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.591
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

181
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:47.901
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

182
00:05:47.901 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in those.</v>

183
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 2>I think if you're going to work out,</v>

184
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:51.041
<v Speaker 2>you should work out.</v>

185
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:51.611
<v Speaker 2>If you got to work out,</v>

186
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 2>you gonna make some noise.</v>

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 2>It sounds very grapey.</v>

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 2>It was planet fitness places.</v>

191
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Those are the worst where you're not allowed to Moan.</v>

192
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen those places?</v>

193
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

200
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Like if it wasn't sexual sounds,</v>

201
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:11.030
<v Speaker 2>it would not be illegal.</v>

<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

218
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to deadlift,</v>

219
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 2>you should be making some fucking noise.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Lightweight.</v>

00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Now what does that Ronnie Coleman,</v>

224
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Ronnie Coleman used to yell out.</v>

225
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:51.824
<v Speaker 2>Lightweight,</v>

226
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.510
<v Speaker 2>lightweight.</v>

227
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 2>I used to hear that Shit in the gym.</v>

228
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:54.674
<v Speaker 2>It was noisy.</v>

229
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand it like that was what he would say to psych himself up for a</v>

230
00:06:57.561 --> 00:06:57.970
<v Speaker 2>big lift.</v>

231
00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:58.620
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

232
00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.240
<v Speaker 2>oh the.</v>

233
00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

234
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 2>the guys in the gym.</v>

235
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:03.590
<v Speaker 2>All these Ronnie Coleman wannabes chanting that.</v>

236
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.560
<v Speaker 2>That guy was so big when he was big.</v>

237
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ was Ronnie Coleman big.</v>

238
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 2>He was big like what?</v>

239
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 2>He was a cop.</v>

240
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:13.641
<v Speaker 2>He was doing it.</v>

241
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:15.290
<v Speaker 2>That was the really nuts shit about that.</v>

242
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Can you Mr. Olympia Guy,</v>

243
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.150
<v Speaker 2>he was so fucking big.</v>

244
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

245
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 2>That guy was huge.</v>

246
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 2>He had a big smile and I can imagine being pulled over by him.</v>

247
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 2>You see that and I bet he was a decent officer a lot anymore.</v>

248
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.250
<v Speaker 2>He got all his aggressions out in the gym to get that big.</v>

249
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 2>You have to work out so fucking hard.</v>

250
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what you're taking does,</v>

251
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.500
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't just make you grow.</v>

252
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Like that guy is working out really hard.</v>

253
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.590
<v Speaker 2>There's something going on outside of steroids.</v>

254
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of hard work there,</v>

255
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.190
<v Speaker 2>so he was probably tired all the time to smile and know.</v>

256
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Always constantly.</v>

257
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:54.650
<v Speaker 2>If you're built like the hulk,</v>

258
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.040
<v Speaker 2>you know much fucking cowards.</v>

259
00:07:56.041 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 2>You have to scarf down and just to stay,</v>

260
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.320
<v Speaker 2>stay afloat anyway.</v>

261
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:05.030
<v Speaker 2>What brought to you by the fuck you doing brought to you by [inaudible] dot com.</v>

262
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 2>A makers of Alpha brain and as we were saying,</v>

263
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I just got the battle ropes in the mail.</v>

264
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 2>Kettlebells are in,</v>

265
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.080
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't used kettlebells to work out is my personal favorite exercise and</v>

266
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 2>someone corrected me on my message board there actually.</v>

267
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

268
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:18.381
<v Speaker 2>They said that.</v>

269
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:21.710
<v Speaker 2>I always say that a bench presses and isolation exercise.</v>

270
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.611
<v Speaker 2>It does work.</v>

271
00:08:22.611 --> 00:08:23.630
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of different muscle groups.</v>

272
00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:23.781
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

273
00:08:23.781 --> 00:08:24.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean is it sort of.</v>

274
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 2>It's an unnatural sort of a thing to just be doing this and what I like about</v>

275
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:32.780
<v Speaker 2>kettlebells is that it requires you to use your whole body.</v>

276
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

277
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.910
<v Speaker 2>when you bench press,</v>

278
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could push off the ground with your feet and it does have some sort</v>

279
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:39.651
<v Speaker 2>of impact.</v>

280
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly I'm against bench press.</v>

281
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean I still do conventional weightlifting to occasionally,</v>

282
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.760
<v Speaker 2>but I think that for me personally,</v>

283
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:47.270
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

284
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:47.780
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

285
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 2>If I had one piece of workout equipment that I would choose to use,</v>

286
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.380
<v Speaker 2>it will be the Kettlebell because you can get an amazing workout with a 30 pound</v>

287
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:55.880
<v Speaker 2>Kettlebell.</v>

288
00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean just break your body down and credit the kind of endurance strain that's</v>

289
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:01.630
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

290
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:02.780
<v Speaker 2>like training Jujitsu,</v>

291
00:09:02.781 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 2>like when someone's trying to strangle you,</v>

292
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 2>like it's the only thing that comes close to making you that hard.</v>

293
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.010
<v Speaker 2>It's an incredible workout and just a 35 pound Kettlebell and it strengthens</v>

294
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:11.611
<v Speaker 2>your whole body,</v>

295
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:12.690
<v Speaker 2>strengthens your core,</v>

296
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:13.291
<v Speaker 2>your abs,</v>

297
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:13.950
<v Speaker 2>your legs,</v>

298
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 2>and you really don't.</v>

299
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.530
<v Speaker 2>It's not that difficult to like formulate a workout program.</v>

300
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 2>You can go look at some of them that are on Youtube.</v>

301
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:24.870
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of guys who have great dvds out there.</v>

302
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Mike Mauler is a great one.</v>

303
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.960
<v Speaker 2>He's got a great DVD.</v>

304
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.430
<v Speaker 2>My friend Steve Maxwell,</v>

305
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 2>fantastic dvds out there.</v>

306
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:36.270
<v Speaker 2>There's always workouts that you can find and you can watch a DVD and follow</v>

307
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:39.690
<v Speaker 2>along with it and literally getting the best fucking shape of your life.</v>

308
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.080
<v Speaker 2>They're amazing for for like actual physical usable strength.</v>

309
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Like if you do anything that requires physical strength and you do kettle bells,</v>

310
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:51.511
<v Speaker 2>it'll make it better.</v>

311
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:52.470
<v Speaker 2>It's really incredible.</v>

312
00:09:52.471 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 2>It just makes your body just stronger as a unit as opposed to like say like</v>

313
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 2>bicep curls.</v>

314
00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:00.090
<v Speaker 2>That would be a true isolation exercise.</v>

315
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Something that's really unnatural where you just only really using the biceps</v>

316
00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:06.960
<v Speaker 2>and maybe a little bit of the forums like he bought.</v>

317
00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:08.340
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't really want to move like that.</v>

318
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 2>Your body wants to pick things up and move as a unit and that in my opinion,</v>

319
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.110
<v Speaker 2>is the best way for fitness to get your body stronger,</v>

320
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 2>to do full body exercises like Turkish getups.</v>

321
00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:21.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're not as romantic as bicep curls,</v>

322
00:10:21.501 --> 00:10:22.110
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

323
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.741
<v Speaker 2>It is true.</v>

324
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:24.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like bicep curls or sex.</v>

325
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.480
<v Speaker 2>Why he screams and moans about it yet and that's why</v>

326
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.580
<v Speaker 2>it gets wet.</v>

327
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:32.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

328
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.110
<v Speaker 2>there's something sexy about it.</v>

329
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.300
<v Speaker 2>There's something sexy about a.</v>

330
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.260
<v Speaker 2>because if a guy's just working as buys,</v>

331
00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:38.520
<v Speaker 2>always trying to do is look good.</v>

332
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.370
<v Speaker 2>Every man in the gym is having an emotional experience.</v>

333
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Some level.</v>

334
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

335
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.110
<v Speaker 2>That's why I will not do.</v>

336
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:45.631
<v Speaker 2>If you do it right,</v>

337
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 2>you've got to get really uncomfortable,</v>

338
00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:47.710
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

339
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Do it right.</v>

340
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.200
<v Speaker 2>You've got to feel like shit.</v>

341
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh by my favorite way to feel like shit is with kettlebells.</v>

342
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:53.251
<v Speaker 2>It feels like shit.</v>

343
00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:54.480
<v Speaker 2>And then I feel awesome afterwards.</v>

344
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.670
<v Speaker 2>That and a Hindu squats.</v>

345
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.960
<v Speaker 2>A lot of you've been saying,</v>

346
00:10:57.961 --> 00:10:59.280
<v Speaker 2>you've been sending tweets about that.</v>

347
00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:01.440
<v Speaker 2>You started doing the Hindu squats and what a big difference it makes.</v>

348
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.090
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking incredible.</v>

349
00:11:03.091 --> 00:11:04.920
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the best exercises you can do.</v>

350
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 2>You don't need a gym,</v>

351
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:06.991
<v Speaker 2>Hindu squats.</v>

352
00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:10.980
<v Speaker 2>I do 200 of them before I do any workout and I am feel like stopping.</v>

353
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.180
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm done at just 200 squats with no weight.</v>

354
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.370
<v Speaker 2>You would think there's no way that's going to be easy.</v>

355
00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:18.061
<v Speaker 2>That's so easy.</v>

356
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:18.894
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

357
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.380
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hard and it gets hard at around like 60,</v>

358
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.390
<v Speaker 2>like around 60 like shit.</v>

359
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.270
<v Speaker 2>And then you're in a seven and then you hit a hundred and you're like another</v>

360
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:28.410
<v Speaker 2>100 of these bitches.</v>

361
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:33.390
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking great to do and it's not like a high weight exercise.</v>

362
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 2>It develops your leg strength without really putting yourself in a precarious</v>

363
00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:38.730
<v Speaker 2>positions with weights on your back.</v>

364
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.400
<v Speaker 2>So it's a good way to start a base of,</v>

365
00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:41.551
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

366
00:11:41.551 --> 00:11:42.420
<v Speaker 2>of training as well.</v>

367
00:11:42.421 --> 00:11:43.060
<v Speaker 2>And so like if you,</v>

368
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.010
<v Speaker 2>if you're not really a guy,</v>

369
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:45.510
<v Speaker 2>works out at all and you're thinking,</v>

370
00:11:45.511 --> 00:11:46.344
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

371
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:47.370
<v Speaker 2>I want to get in shape,</v>

372
00:11:47.371 --> 00:11:48.121
<v Speaker 2>don't go crazy.</v>

373
00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:49.530
<v Speaker 2>And just immediately start doing squats.</v>

374
00:11:49.531 --> 00:11:53.080
<v Speaker 2>Our friend Kevin Pereira was in here yesterday and he's all fucked up because of</v>

375
00:11:53.081 --> 00:11:55.150
<v Speaker 2>that very reason because he didn't work out.</v>

376
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.180
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden he was doing crazy fucking power lifts three times a</v>

377
00:11:58.181 --> 00:11:59.014
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

378
00:11:59.170 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

379
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.210
<v Speaker 2>point is go to [inaudible] dot com.</v>

380
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.530
<v Speaker 2>This is our only sponsor.</v>

381
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:06.600
<v Speaker 2>We'll have one sponsor now on it is the spa.</v>

382
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.830
<v Speaker 2>We only have one sponsor.</v>

383
00:12:07.831 --> 00:12:10.390
<v Speaker 2>He has still managed to have a 15 fucking minutes commercial.</v>

384
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Three dream sponsors.</v>

385
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 2>What would your three dream sponsors be?</v>

386
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:15.550
<v Speaker 2>We'd have to think about that.</v>

387
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.593
<v Speaker 2>Let's think about that,</v>

388
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.201
<v Speaker 2>Jack Daniels,</v>

389
00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>

390
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 2>that would be to have to evolve from the flashlight to the real doll,</v>

391
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:21.994
<v Speaker 2>don't you?</v>

392
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.650
<v Speaker 2>It's not evolution.</v>

393
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.110
<v Speaker 2>The real deal is creepy as fuck the fleshlight.</v>

394
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:27.430
<v Speaker 2>You just putting something over your Dick.</v>

395
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.481
<v Speaker 2>The real dollars.</v>

396
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:29.830
<v Speaker 2>You're pretending that a woman.</v>

397
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that a relative?</v>

398
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Creepiness?</v>

399
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

400
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.983
<v Speaker 2>totally relevant,</v>

401
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 2>but the actual fiber of the fleshlight is superior.</v>

402
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.121
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly.</v>

403
00:12:37.121 --> 00:12:38.530
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say fiber texture.</v>

404
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

405
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.710
<v Speaker 2>but have you ever used a Jack Daniels bottle as a flashlight?</v>

406
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.510
<v Speaker 2>My Dick is way too big for that now.</v>

407
00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Now if you break it off at the end,</v>

408
00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.250
<v Speaker 2>the fuck praying,</v>

409
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.330
<v Speaker 2>you're making no sense.</v>

410
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Ain't gonna make me end this commercial.</v>

411
00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:50.980
<v Speaker 2>If data is your strategy,</v>

412
00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:51.340
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

413
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.173
<v Speaker 2>it's over.</v>

414
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.310

422
00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't get behind anything unless I 100 percent believe in it.</v>

423
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.493
<v Speaker 2>Even the flashlight,</v>

424
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.490
<v Speaker 2>if you want to beat off,</v>

425
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.270
<v Speaker 2>that's better.</v>

426

00:13:16.841 --> 00:13:17.830
<v Speaker 2>the first 30 pills,</v>

431
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.750
<v Speaker 2>there was a 100 percent money back guarantee.</v>

437
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.151
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

438
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:36.151
<v Speaker 2>I'm way more concerned about having people feel like this is a even transaction</v>

439
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.000
<v Speaker 2>and this is a good deal for them than I am about making money.</v>

445
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fuck this up as long as you don't say Kokesh.</v>

446
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.020
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that to coke.</v>

447
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:51.123
<v Speaker 2>Coke,</v>

448
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:51.611

454
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.840
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm not on a problem.</v>

455
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:02.500
<v Speaker 2>We will.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Thank you fred.</v>

464
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.503
<v Speaker 3>During that commercial,</v>

465
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.410
<v Speaker 3>you know you were here for a very</v>

466
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.150
<v Speaker 2>emotional moment for us.</v>

467
00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:25.690
<v Speaker 2>The last,</v>

468
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:26.291
<v Speaker 2>the flashlight.</v>

469
00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:27.124
<v Speaker 2>I understand sir,</v>

470
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.860
<v Speaker 2>and I'm glad we got through that together.</v>

471
00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I understand that deep emotional connection you can have with masturbatory aids.</v>

472
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

473
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:35.111
<v Speaker 2>It's not that.</v>

474
00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:40.111
<v Speaker 2>It's that they paid us that was deep emotional and it's a solid product,</v>

475
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

476
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:43.000
<v Speaker 2>controversial but a solid product.</v>

477
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.010
<v Speaker 2>You can totally pull back your microphone also.</v>

478
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.070
<v Speaker 2>It stretches out reaching.</v>

479
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:49.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

480
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

481
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 2>That's part of what we're kind of a street like</v>

482
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.860
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

483
00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.130
<v Speaker 4>A little bit underground tributing.</v>

484
00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.770
<v Speaker 4>If I do it like a poignant moments,</v>

485
00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.781
<v Speaker 4>people know.</v>

486
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:00.140
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

487
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.700
<v Speaker 4>that was a real microphone cord there.</v>

488
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:03.500
<v Speaker 4>You asked what was actually happening.</v>

489
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.370
<v Speaker 4>It's the cat clock.</v>

490
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 4>You think they like to count snowflake mentality.</v>

491
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.660
<v Speaker 4>You think people like the cat clock really makes it sound less professional.</v>

492
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:11.811
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

493
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:13.640
<v Speaker 4>people think it's like a studio and stuff.</v>

494
00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:14.474
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy like that.</v>

495
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:14.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

496
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.140
<v Speaker 4>but that clock does interrupt your thought process for a second.</v>

497
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.070
<v Speaker 4>First second,</v>

498
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:19.903
<v Speaker 4>maybe not.</v>

499
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.860
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it makes you up to how retarded you or you're fucking cat clock.</v>

500
00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:26.690
<v Speaker 4>The clock me out every time the the,</v>

501
00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:27.524
<v Speaker 4>our changes.</v>

502
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:32.330
<v Speaker 4>More twitter followers are intuitive twitter than most people have blocked does.</v>

503
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:33.820
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know there was a catalog.</v>

504
00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:34.893
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

505
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:35.990
<v Speaker 4>I think it's red bands.</v>

506
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.580
<v Speaker 4>Cat clock and it just,</v>

507
00:15:37.581 --> 00:15:38.800
<v Speaker 4>it always is like,</v>

508
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.261
<v Speaker 4>it's always like,</v>

509
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:39.651
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

510
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:40.790
<v Speaker 4>why are you so mean to me?</v>

511
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.790
<v Speaker 4>Or this is why I have faith in the Internet.</v>

512
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:44.960
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

513
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.730
<v Speaker 4>the Internet is the ultimate balancing act,</v>

514
00:15:46.731 --> 00:15:47.230
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

515
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

516
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.591
<v Speaker 4>That's how we met,</v>

517
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:48.771
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

518
00:15:48.771 --> 00:15:48.981
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

519
00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:50.660
<v Speaker 4>you have a hat with your own name on it.</v>

520
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.010
<v Speaker 4>I know it's kind of sticker with your own name on it like you are.</v>

521
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.070
<v Speaker 4>You are 100 percent dedicated to you.</v>

522
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:57.321
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

523
00:15:57.321 --> 00:15:58.310
<v Speaker 4>Well I,</v>

524
00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.300
<v Speaker 4>I stopped short it wearing the t shirt usually because that's a little creepy.</v>

525
00:16:02.301 --> 00:16:03.600
<v Speaker 4>Is the t shirt and a hat together?</v>

526
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:04.250
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

527
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:04.460
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

528
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.211
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't happen,</v>

529
00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:08.200
<v Speaker 4>but dice clay was onstage at the Riviera and Vegas this weekend and he had a</v>

530
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.140
<v Speaker 4>dice shirt on.</v>

531
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.200
<v Speaker 4>It was perfect and then he sells that shirt.</v>

532
00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:13.041
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

533
00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:16.130
<v Speaker 4>it just says dice and the eye is like a dice,</v>

534
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:16.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

535
00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:17.750
<v Speaker 4>like a dice cube.</v>

536
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.950
<v Speaker 4>So you were a good company with a hat,</v>

537
00:16:21.951 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 4>with your name on it.</v>

538
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.473
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

539
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.891
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

540
00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:25.370
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

541
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.600
<v Speaker 4>how long have you been doing this show,</v>

542
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:27.620
<v Speaker 4>Adam versus demand?</v>

543
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:27.921
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

544
00:16:27.921 --> 00:16:32.870
<v Speaker 4>that's a good question because I got to go way back to just even explain how I</v>

545
00:16:32.871 --> 00:16:36.500
<v Speaker 4>started to stumble into this now and explain to people to explain to people what</v>

546
00:16:36.501 --> 00:16:37.011
<v Speaker 4>your show is,</v>

547
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:39.620
<v Speaker 4>where people have never heard it's Adam versus the [inaudible] dot com.</v>

548
00:16:39.621 --> 00:16:41.600
<v Speaker 4>I do a daily podcast except when I'm,</v>

549
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:42.331
<v Speaker 4>when I'm traveling.</v>

550
00:16:42.331 --> 00:16:45.640
<v Speaker 4>Like I haven't been so much recently but I didn't want in Denver the other day,</v>

551
00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.470
<v Speaker 4>but I normally do it out of my apartment in northern Virginia.</v>

552
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:51.160
<v Speaker 4>So I'm inside the beltway in Washington DC.</v>

553
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:56.150
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I'm dancing around the feet of the Leviathan there and I'm able,</v>

554
00:16:56.151 --> 00:16:57.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm able to poke the man.</v>

555
00:16:57.561 --> 00:16:59.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm able to poke the machine there,</v>

556
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.291
<v Speaker 4>but I really,</v>

557
00:17:00.291 --> 00:17:01.250
<v Speaker 4>I really hate living there.</v>

558
00:17:01.251 --> 00:17:01.361
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

559
00:17:01.361 --> 00:17:02.540
<v Speaker 4>it's really weird.</v>

560
00:17:02.541 --> 00:17:06.020
<v Speaker 4>But I do my show out of my apartment there and I do a youtube channel,</v>

561
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.310
<v Speaker 4>youtube.com/Adam,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

568
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.160
<v Speaker 4>none of what I do is work anymore.</v>

569
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.040
<v Speaker 4>I absolutely love it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm obsessed with what I do.</v>

574
00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:18.140
<v Speaker 4>I am absolutely committed and driven and passionate about it.</v>

575
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:18.801
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

576
00:17:18.801 --> 00:17:19.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

577
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:19.161
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

578
00:17:19.161 --> 00:17:19.971
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

579
00:17:19.971 --> 00:17:22.910
<v Speaker 4>I have to smoke weed to slow me down if anything,</v>

580
00:17:22.911 --> 00:17:26.600
<v Speaker 4>but I always do my podcasts over every morning and we post highlights from that</v>

581
00:17:26.601 --> 00:17:27.434
<v Speaker 4>to youtube.</v>

582
00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.910
<v Speaker 4>But I started my activism way back in college.</v>

583
00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.040
<v Speaker 4>Libertarians in,</v>

584
00:17:33.041 --> 00:17:33.770
<v Speaker 4>in Claremont,</v>

585
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:34.790
<v Speaker 4>not too far from here,</v>

586
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:35.251
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

587
00:17:35.251 --> 00:17:36.320
<v Speaker 4>was at Claremont Mckenna.</v>

588
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.251
<v Speaker 4>And I didn't,</v>

589
00:17:37.251 --> 00:17:38.061
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really get it.</v>

590
00:17:38.061 --> 00:17:38.301
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>

591
00:17:38.301 --> 00:17:39.500
<v Speaker 4>libertarian was,</v>

592
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.111
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

593
00:17:40.111 --> 00:17:42.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to be a republican or a Democrat because that Shit's lame,</v>

594
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:43.514
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

595
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.080
<v Speaker 4>that's just too obvious I'm going to be.</v>

596
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:46.350
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>

597
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.620
<v Speaker 4>exactly an indie.</v>

598
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:48.800
<v Speaker 4>And it was kind of a way of,</v>

599
00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:49.050
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

600
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:49.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

601
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.700
<v Speaker 4>sticking it to the man to say,</v>

602
00:17:50.701 --> 00:17:50.971
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

603
00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:54.840
<v Speaker 4>like down with your rules were for drugs and prostitution.</v>

604
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.840
<v Speaker 4>And it was that sort of macho flash libertarianism and my story is really of the</v>

605
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.740
<v Speaker 4>deepening of my understanding of the philosophy of this,</v>

606
00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:08.460
<v Speaker 4>because I went to Iraq in the middle of all this.</v>

607
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:09.990
<v Speaker 4>I was in Fallujah in 2004.</v>

608
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:12.780
<v Speaker 4>I was a reservist while I was going to college and I've volunteered for what I</v>

609
00:18:12.781 --> 00:18:17.070
<v Speaker 4>called my semester abroad and I did seven months in Fallujah with the civil</v>

610
00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:17.761
<v Speaker 4>affairs team.</v>

611
00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:21.570
<v Speaker 4>I was in combat for most of that time and it was.</v>

612
00:18:21.571 --> 00:18:25.890
<v Speaker 4>It was a really intense experience and coming home and watching the second</v>

613
00:18:25.891 --> 00:18:28.350
<v Speaker 4>battle of Fallujah play out on the front page of the New York Times.</v>

614
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:32.010
<v Speaker 4>While I knew that the only reason we saw so many marines dying was because of</v>

615
00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:35.640
<v Speaker 4>the political manipulations of what was happening in the city over the summer</v>

616
00:18:35.641 --> 00:18:37.710
<v Speaker 4>that I was there and I was there February,</v>

617
00:18:37.711 --> 00:18:39.120
<v Speaker 4>September 2004.</v>

618
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:44.480
<v Speaker 4>And coming back and realizing that people were dying for political bullshit was</v>

619
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.800
<v Speaker 4>a a significant turning point for me and wanting to really figure out what was</v>

620
00:18:50.701 --> 00:18:51.301
<v Speaker 4>behind this.</v>

621
00:18:51.301 --> 00:18:51.841
<v Speaker 4>And this is the thing.</v>

622
00:18:51.841 --> 00:18:52.950
<v Speaker 4>I think that sets Libertarians,</v>

623
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:55.680
<v Speaker 4>a partner that I think a lot of people in my audience appreciate about your</v>

624
00:18:55.681 --> 00:18:58.770
<v Speaker 4>perspective is that you ask why and when you don't have good answers,</v>

625
00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:02.280
<v Speaker 4>you reject the bullshit and the propaganda and you see past it and you know,</v>

626
00:19:02.281 --> 00:19:06.480
<v Speaker 4>your understanding of foreign policy from that perspective is very appreciated</v>

627
00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:09.870
<v Speaker 4>by a lot of veterans who have gone through a similar experience that I have.</v>

628
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:13.050
<v Speaker 4>So I got back and I was active with Iraq veterans against the war,</v>

629
00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.170
<v Speaker 4>actually moved to DC to get a masters in political management.</v>

630
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.360
<v Speaker 4>Oh actually I should say I actually,</v>

631
00:19:18.361 --> 00:19:23.220
<v Speaker 4>I got in trouble for bringing a pistol back from Iraq and it was,</v>

632
00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:24.240
<v Speaker 4>it was a really nice one.</v>

633
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.540
<v Speaker 4>It was like engraved as a gift from Saddam Hussein and have little gold plated</v>

634
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.340
<v Speaker 4>medallions on the pistol grip.</v>

635
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

636
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.410
<v Speaker 4>And I got in trouble for bringing them.</v>

637
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

638
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.910
<v Speaker 4>it's a long story,</v>

639
00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:36.330
<v Speaker 4>but I had it on campus and my car got stolen out of my car and instead of</v>

640
00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:36.841
<v Speaker 4>letting it go,</v>

641
00:19:36.841 --> 00:19:41.040
<v Speaker 4>I chased the guy down and there was a campus security guy there and that's how I</v>

642
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:44.780
<v Speaker 4>got snagged for having an on campus and it got confiscated and I tried to go.</v>

643
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:49.820
<v Speaker 4>I tried to go back to Iraq and this is the thing that really the flip that</v>

644
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.220
<v Speaker 4>switch in your brain when you go through bootcamp these days and you know,</v>

645
00:19:53.221 --> 00:19:57.000
<v Speaker 4>they've heavily developed the psychological process,</v>

646
00:19:57.001 --> 00:19:59.730
<v Speaker 4>the conditioning that you go through to make sure that you will obey orders and</v>

647
00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Speaker 4>you will pull the trigger.</v>

648
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.740
<v Speaker 4>And the reason I wanted to go back to Iraq was because I didn't get a purple</v>

649
00:20:04.741 --> 00:20:05.574
<v Speaker 4>heart the first time.</v>

650
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:06.271
<v Speaker 4>Like I hadn't.</v>

651
00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:07.410
<v Speaker 4>I hadn't bled enough.</v>

652
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:13.010
<v Speaker 4>And it really is a sick thing and this is what makes the military mentality</v>

653
00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:14.281
<v Speaker 4>distinct.</v>

654
00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:18.270
<v Speaker 4>There is nothing more glorious than dying for your country.</v>

655
00:20:18.271 --> 00:20:19.260
<v Speaker 4>And even patents said,</v>

656
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

657
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.080
<v Speaker 4>it's making the poor bastard die for his.</v>

658
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.861
<v Speaker 4>But in order to,</v>

659
00:20:22.861 --> 00:20:23.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

660
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:24.180
<v Speaker 4>as part of the conditioning,</v>

661
00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:27.650
<v Speaker 4>especially in the marines where there's that certain machismo that first of</v>

662
00:20:27.651 --> 00:20:29.120
<v Speaker 4>fight attitude and you know,</v>

663
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.450
<v Speaker 4>there's a noble intent behind it.</v>

664
00:20:30.451 --> 00:20:32.760
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to have my life in the line from my country,</v>

665
00:20:32.761 --> 00:20:35.220
<v Speaker 4>but really for the people of America,</v>

666
00:20:35.221 --> 00:20:35.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

667
00:20:35.431 --> 00:20:37.290
<v Speaker 4>and that was why I enlisted in the first place.</v>

668
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.180
<v Speaker 4>So they looked at it as what's the best way to get people to listen to us?</v>

669
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:42.811
<v Speaker 4>What is the,</v>

670
00:20:42.811 --> 00:20:46.380
<v Speaker 4>what's the best way to get people to do the impossible to do the unthinkable.</v>

671
00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 4>He tell that that's what they're supposed</v>

672
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.270
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

673
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.830
<v Speaker 2>You have.</v>

674
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.920
<v Speaker 2>We have to figure out what the best way to program them is.</v>

675
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:52.390
<v Speaker 2>And they figured it out and they nailed it.</v>

676
00:20:52.391 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 2>They got an account that pride that,</v>

677
00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:56.340
<v Speaker 2>that fucking that is spreading her.</v>

678
00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:56.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

679
00:20:56.601 --> 00:20:57.221
<v Speaker 2>That feeling,</v>

680
00:20:57.221 --> 00:20:57.700
<v Speaker 2>they put them in the,</v>

681
00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.060
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>

682
00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:58.600
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

683
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.250
<v Speaker 2>the training sequences and formula.</v>

684
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:00.490
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>

685
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:00.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

686
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.011
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

687
00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:01.870
<v Speaker 4>it's not just that,</v>

688
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.730
<v Speaker 4>because the lesson to be learned here is that it's,</v>

689
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:04.600
<v Speaker 4>it's everybody.</v>

690
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.580
<v Speaker 4>Everybody who waves the American flag or the nationalism that's imbued in all of</v>

691
00:21:09.581 --> 00:21:09.791
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

692
00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:11.590
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing to a lesser degree,</v>

693
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.540
<v Speaker 4>but it's still a perversion of humanity.</v>

694
00:21:13.541 --> 00:21:16.660
<v Speaker 4>It's still a perversion of the way human beings are designed to get along.</v>

695
00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:17.494
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

696
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:17.790
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

697
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:22.540
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea of being an American should be an ideal.</v>

698
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:24.700
<v Speaker 2>It should be an idea that we have in our head and should be.</v>

699
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.900
<v Speaker 2>We should look at being American as something we should aspire to,</v>

700
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.000
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that somehow or another we're against them or they're against us.</v>

701
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck are you talking about it and we don't even know them.</v>

702
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.141
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

703
00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:38.621
<v Speaker 4>and it's not.</v>

704
00:21:38.621 --> 00:21:42.220
<v Speaker 4>It's not about the arbitrary lines set up by government around us or it's the</v>

705
00:21:42.221 --> 00:21:43.120
<v Speaker 4>American heritage,</v>

706
00:21:43.121 --> 00:21:46.630
<v Speaker 4>the American traditional moving towards greater freedom and the stuff that that</v>

707
00:21:46.631 --> 00:21:47.464
<v Speaker 4>represented.</v>

708
00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.340
<v Speaker 4>The whole revolutionary war is a step forward in and the human understanding of</v>

709
00:21:51.341 --> 00:21:52.030
<v Speaker 4>liberty,</v>

710
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:52.640
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

711
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:52.870
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

712
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.370
<v Speaker 4>it's an idea that's global.</v>

713
00:21:54.371 --> 00:21:55.900
<v Speaker 4>It's essential to the human nature does it,</v>

714
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.590
<v Speaker 4>and now we see that America as defined by any specific thing other than that is,</v>

715
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.713
<v Speaker 4>let's be honest.</v>

716
00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:02.770
<v Speaker 4>Kind of fucking disgusting.</v>

717
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

718
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:03.870
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

719
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Scary and America should be what we can contribute.</v>

720
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:09.571
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

721
00:22:09.571 --> 00:22:09.751
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

722
00:22:09.751 --> 00:22:12.930
<v Speaker 2>what is our potential or potential to contribute is so much greater.</v>

723
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

724
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.600
<v Speaker 2>America is not the military industrial complex.</v>

725
00:22:15.601 --> 00:22:17.910
<v Speaker 2>America is the best fucking music that's ever been created.</v>

726
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.190
<v Speaker 2>America's the best movies that's ever been created.</v>

727
00:22:20.191 --> 00:22:21.180
<v Speaker 2>The most creativity,</v>

728
00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:22.240
<v Speaker 2>the most designed,</v>

729
00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:22.710
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

730
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:23.580
<v Speaker 2>all that shit.</v>

731
00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:24.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

732
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.350
<v Speaker 2>I love my friends in Europe.</v>

733
00:22:25.351 --> 00:22:26.640
<v Speaker 2>I love the Japanese is not.</v>

734
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that I did any of this.</v>

735
00:22:28.561 --> 00:22:30.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not taking any credit for this.</v>

736
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:31.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking idiot.</v>

737
00:22:31.651 --> 00:22:33.210
<v Speaker 2>I've never invented shit in my life,</v>

738
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.590
<v Speaker 2>but if I look at it objectively,</v>

739
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.880
<v Speaker 2>even if I lived in Spain,</v>

740
00:22:35.881 --> 00:22:36.714
<v Speaker 2>I would tell you this,</v>

741
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.231
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

742
00:22:37.231 --> 00:22:42.231
<v Speaker 2>look at this freak motherfucker country that in 200 years exploded onto the map,</v>

743
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:44.760
<v Speaker 2>covered the grove,</v>

744
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:47.520
<v Speaker 2>the globe with weapons controlled the whole thing,</v>

745
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:48.900
<v Speaker 2>locked it all down.</v>

746
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Started boards like,</v>

747
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

748
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.310
<v Speaker 2>what a crazy little country you guys got,</v>

749
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.050
<v Speaker 2>and then got really fat and stupid.</v>

750
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:55.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

751
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.690
<v Speaker 2>it's fat and lazy and a lot of ways,</v>

752
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:58.230
<v Speaker 2>a lot,</v>

753
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.760
<v Speaker 2>a lot of dumb shit going on.</v>

754
00:22:59.761 --> 00:22:59.881
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

755
00:22:59.881 --> 00:23:00.750
<v Speaker 2>let's just corruption.</v>

756
00:23:00.751 --> 00:23:05.751
<v Speaker 2>You can't maintain a steady ship with a constant flow of corruption.</v>

757
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Eventually it just goes off the rails,</v>

758
00:23:08.361 --> 00:23:09.240
<v Speaker 2>so eventually you just,</v>

759
00:23:09.241 --> 00:23:10.860
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to balance out,</v>

760
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:11.640
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

761
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.720
<v Speaker 2>you're not being honest about how you're running things.</v>

762
00:23:13.721 --> 00:23:13.800
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

763
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.000
<v Speaker 2>so thing is disgusting.</v>

764
00:23:15.001 --> 00:23:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not like,</v>

765
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.520
<v Speaker 2>like there was a threat that we needed to go after,</v>

766
00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:20.090
<v Speaker 2>don't you?</v>

767
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.400
<v Speaker 2>You guys are creating problems so you can capitalize on resources.</v>

768
00:23:23.401 --> 00:23:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Like it couldn't be any more obvious kind of the definition of government</v>

769
00:23:26.641 --> 00:23:27.270
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

770
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:32.270
<v Speaker 2>But it's the scariest thing ever that most people would never believe that if</v>

771
00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:33.444
<v Speaker 2>you told them that,</v>

772
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.550
<v Speaker 2>they would say that is hippie bullshit.</v>

773
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.200
<v Speaker 2>That is nonsense.</v>

774
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck do you think you are to think like that?</v>

775
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:40.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

776
00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:41.850
<v Speaker 2>what kind of a person are you?</v>

777
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:43.150
<v Speaker 4>This is America.</v>

778
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.420
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

779
00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:43.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

780
00:23:43.581 --> 00:23:44.990
<v Speaker 4>you said it in you.</v>

781
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.460
<v Speaker 4>I listened to your podcast with Georgiou sucralose and you said,</v>

782
00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:49.701
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

783
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:50.421
<v Speaker 4>with aliens,</v>

784
00:23:50.421 --> 00:23:52.490
<v Speaker 4>like everybody's looking for a daddy and it's this.</v>

785
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:57.640
<v Speaker 4>It's this manifestation of that psychological desire to be taken care of.</v>

786
00:23:58.191 --> 00:24:00.750
<v Speaker 4>And it was worse is with government for a lot of it.</v>

787
00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:05.850
<v Speaker 4>You said it was aliens and it was God and religion and I don't know what else.</v>

788
00:24:06.081 --> 00:24:06.980
<v Speaker 4>You said a couple of other things,</v>

789
00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:08.110
<v Speaker 4>but you didn't say it was.</v>

790
00:24:08.111 --> 00:24:08.350
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

791
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:09.171
<v Speaker 4>It was government.</v>

792
00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:09.411
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

793
00:24:09.411 --> 00:24:09.800
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

794
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.160
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

795
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.000
<v Speaker 4>that's the big one.</v>

796
00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:11.630
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's,</v>

797
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:13.250
<v Speaker 4>that's the global paradigm.</v>

798
00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:16.760
<v Speaker 4>That's like the phase of evolution that we're at in humanity that we're seeing</v>

799
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:18.290
<v Speaker 4>the institutionalization,</v>

800
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.590
<v Speaker 4>institutionalization will collapse of when we see,</v>

801
00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:21.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

802
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.480
<v Speaker 4>this is all centered around the scam of,</v>

803
00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:24.620
<v Speaker 4>of the central banks,</v>

804
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.020
<v Speaker 4>of the Fiat currency because that's how they really rip us off.</v>

805
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:28.670
<v Speaker 4>Everything else is about control,</v>

806
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:29.960
<v Speaker 4>but that's the real incentive.</v>

807
00:24:29.961 --> 00:24:31.160
<v Speaker 4>It's all about exploitation.</v>

808
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:31.761
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

809
00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:31.971
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

810
00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:32.151
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

811
00:24:32.151 --> 00:24:33.230
<v Speaker 4>that's what motivates everything.</v>

812
00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:34.550
<v Speaker 4>As a motivates government.</v>

813
00:24:34.551 --> 00:24:37.000
<v Speaker 4>The banking system is so confusing for people.</v>

814
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.510
<v Speaker 4>When you say the banking system,</v>

815
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.300
<v Speaker 4>it's like you might as well just be making some noises with your mouth.</v>

816
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:43.520
<v Speaker 4>Nobody really even understands what the fuck is going on.</v>

817
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.940
<v Speaker 4>It's propaganda and it's designed to make you confused and when you look at how</v>

818
00:24:46.941 --> 00:24:47.780
<v Speaker 4>much money they have,</v>

819
00:24:47.781 --> 00:24:48.141
<v Speaker 4>when you go,</v>

820
00:24:48.141 --> 00:24:48.591
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

821
00:24:48.591 --> 00:24:48.951
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

822
00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:49.071
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

823
00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 4>what is that exactly?</v>

824
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:52.340
<v Speaker 4>Because are you,</v>

825
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.040
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck do you do that?</v>

826
00:24:54.041 --> 00:24:55.640
<v Speaker 4>You get all these ones and Zeros.</v>

827
00:24:55.641 --> 00:24:56.720
<v Speaker 4>Where's it all coming from?</v>

828
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.160
<v Speaker 4>How do you work with.</v>

829
00:24:58.161 --> 00:25:00.440
<v Speaker 4>Here's why they don't teach economics in high school though.</v>

830
00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:04.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean because the basic concepts that anybody can understand what have you very</v>

831
00:25:04.371 --> 00:25:08.480
<v Speaker 4>easily come to the conclusion with a very sound basis of,</v>

832
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:11.810
<v Speaker 4>of rationale and understanding of economic framework to get to the point where</v>

833
00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:12.170
<v Speaker 4>you can.</v>

834
00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.370
<v Speaker 4>No really,</v>

835
00:25:13.371 --> 00:25:14.204
<v Speaker 4>really no,</v>

836
00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.800
<v Speaker 4>we're getting fucked.</v>

837
00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:19.910
<v Speaker 4>That like all of the exponential increases in productivity that should lead to</v>

838
00:25:19.911 --> 00:25:22.940
<v Speaker 4>an increase in quality of life for everybody.</v>

839
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.710
<v Speaker 4>It's still going up and we still see it,</v>

840
00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:24.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

841
00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.110
<v Speaker 4>the fact that we have smartphones and computers and all this shit,</v>

842
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:27.591
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

843
00:25:27.591 --> 00:25:27.691
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

844
00:25:27.691 --> 00:25:29.960
<v Speaker 4>and that the average American is so much better off.</v>

845
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.490
<v Speaker 4>That's still an exponential growth.</v>

846
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.540
<v Speaker 4>But what it would really be if you didn't have everybody who's on the teat of</v>

847
00:25:35.541 --> 00:25:38.430
<v Speaker 4>government sucking all this wealth away would have us,</v>

848
00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:39.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

849
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.480
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

850
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.730
<v Speaker 4>in flying cars by now.</v>

851
00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:41.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

852
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.110
<v Speaker 4>I know that sounds crazy,</v>

853
00:25:42.111 --> 00:25:45.890
<v Speaker 4>but you see the wealth that's being sucked away and what the implication is of</v>

854
00:25:45.891 --> 00:25:46.370
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

855
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:50.030
<v Speaker 4>we are getting fucked and what's worse is that we're institutionalizing a system</v>

856
00:25:50.031 --> 00:25:53.540
<v Speaker 4>that is not just a system that robs from us,</v>

857
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:54.950
<v Speaker 4>but that kills people.</v>

858
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:55.640
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

859
00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.170
<v Speaker 4>that's the police state,</v>

860
00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:57.351
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

861
00:25:57.351 --> 00:25:58.910
<v Speaker 4>the military industrial complex.</v>

862
00:25:58.930 --> 00:25:59.120
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

863
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.530
<v Speaker 4>the spasms of,</v>

864
00:26:00.531 --> 00:26:01.251
<v Speaker 4>of statism,</v>

865
00:26:01.251 --> 00:26:01.860
<v Speaker 4>of our.</v>

866
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.710
<v Speaker 4>But what government fundamentally is,</v>

867
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:08.090
<v Speaker 4>is the institutionalization of all of our desires to control and dominate and</v>

868
00:26:08.091 --> 00:26:09.500
<v Speaker 4>manipulate others by force.</v>

869
00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:11.120
<v Speaker 4>It's pathological behavior.</v>

870
00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.200
<v Speaker 4>It's pathological.</v>

871
00:26:12.201 --> 00:26:13.400
<v Speaker 4>It's based on fear.</v>

872
00:26:13.401 --> 00:26:17.160
<v Speaker 4>It's based on putting fear into its citizens and being afraid of the other</v>

873
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.550
<v Speaker 4>people in the world that other people are not us.</v>

874
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:20.780
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

875
00:26:20.781 --> 00:26:25.781
<v Speaker 4>until we figure out a way to treat everyone that we meet in this life as if it</v>

876
00:26:26.181 --> 00:26:30.800
<v Speaker 4>was you living another life and told the world can adopt and develop that</v>

877
00:26:30.801 --> 00:26:31.634
<v Speaker 4>attitude.</v>

878
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.750
<v Speaker 4>We're always going to have clients that are gonna lead us against other cons.</v>

879
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:36.201
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

880
00:26:36.201 --> 00:26:37.550
<v Speaker 4>that's just the way it is.</v>

881
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:39.290
<v Speaker 4>We are flawed,</v>

882
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:44.291
<v Speaker 4>fucked up species and somehow or another we still have the echoes and remanence</v>

883
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:49.110
<v Speaker 2>of the bygone sword fights in our fucking DNA,</v>

884
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:49.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

885
00:26:49.771 --> 00:26:53.580
<v Speaker 2>that shit's still rattles around inside our head and at the highest levels of</v>

886
00:26:53.581 --> 00:26:54.330
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

887
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:59.280
<v Speaker 2>They're willing to sacrifice lives for money at a drop of a hat.</v>

888
00:26:59.281 --> 00:27:02.490
<v Speaker 2>They're not worried about it at all and they're going to go and clean up</v>

889
00:27:02.491 --> 00:27:04.620
<v Speaker 2>afterwards and make money on that as well.</v>

890
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

891
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:05.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

892
00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:09.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a staggering business that's based on 100 percent horseshit.</v>

893
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.770
<v Speaker 2>The idea that no one went to jail after that whole weapons of mass destruction</v>

894
00:27:13.771 --> 00:27:14.880
<v Speaker 2>thing and in Iraq,</v>

895
00:27:14.881 --> 00:27:19.200
<v Speaker 2>the fact that none of those cuts went to jail for lying about weapons of mass</v>

896
00:27:19.201 --> 00:27:19.680
<v Speaker 2>destruction.</v>

897
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Being in Iraq,</v>

898
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.330
<v Speaker 2>just that alone,</v>

899
00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 2>it just shows you like,</v>

900
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.600
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck did you do?</v>

901
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Like what did you.</v>

902
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.240
<v Speaker 2>How do you not go to jail for that?</v>

903
00:27:27.241 --> 00:27:28.530
<v Speaker 2>If you can't go to jail for that,</v>

904
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.320
<v Speaker 2>how are you trying to pretend that this is a just system?</v>

905
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.300
<v Speaker 2>You guys made some shit up about weapons of mass destruction purposely to get</v>

906
00:27:36.301 --> 00:27:40.410
<v Speaker 2>people to go to war and then a million people are dead now and you don't think</v>

907
00:27:40.411 --> 00:27:41.310
<v Speaker 2>you fucked up.</v>

908
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:43.620
<v Speaker 2>You think that was the smart move.</v>

909
00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:44.523
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

910
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:45.171
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

911
00:27:45.171 --> 00:27:46.440
<v Speaker 2>you know why that's possible?</v>

912
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:51.570
<v Speaker 2>Because the people that supported it would rather live with that cognitive</v>

913
00:27:51.571 --> 00:27:53.190
<v Speaker 2>dissonance than face up to the truth.</v>

914
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

915
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.670
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's also just,</v>

916
00:27:57.050 --> 00:28:01.470
<v Speaker 2>it's harder because we have such a psychological investment in America,</v>

917
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:01.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

918
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:02.341
<v Speaker 2>in our national,</v>

919
00:28:02.341 --> 00:28:03.450
<v Speaker 2>we're Americans,</v>

920
00:28:03.451 --> 00:28:03.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

921
00:28:03.661 --> 00:28:05.260
<v Speaker 2>like that is who we are and,</v>

922
00:28:05.261 --> 00:28:05.461
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

923
00:28:05.461 --> 00:28:05.941
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

924
00:28:05.941 --> 00:28:06.121
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

925
00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:07.350
<v Speaker 2>you're a human being.</v>

926
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.101
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

927
00:28:08.101 --> 00:28:09.120
<v Speaker 2>you have to see past that.</v>

928
00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:11.670
<v Speaker 2>But when you meet Nice people from other countries and you're like,</v>

929
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:12.511
<v Speaker 2>poor fuck though,</v>

930
00:28:12.511 --> 00:28:13.344
<v Speaker 2>he's Canadian,</v>

931
00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:15.000
<v Speaker 2>be American.</v>

932
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:15.541
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

933
00:28:15.541 --> 00:28:16.500
<v Speaker 2>people think like that.</v>

934
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:17.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

935
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.570
<v Speaker 2>you meet someone in Norway,</v>

936
00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:19.404
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

937
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:21.810
<v Speaker 2>poor guy born in Norway and shit.</v>

938
00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:23.880
<v Speaker 2>What a great time.</v>

939
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:24.721
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

940
00:28:24.721 --> 00:28:29.721
<v Speaker 2>we have a very distinct and intense form of nationalism because we're such a war</v>

941
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.193
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

942
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:31.591
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

943
00:28:31.591 --> 00:28:32.910
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to think of ourselves as that.</v>

944
00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.100
<v Speaker 2>I would like to think of ourselves as educated,</v>

945
00:28:35.101 --> 00:28:35.881
<v Speaker 2>enlightened people,</v>

946
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:36.960
<v Speaker 2>but as a collective,</v>

947
00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.660
<v Speaker 2>if we really are accepting the fact that we move as a group,</v>

948
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:40.201
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

949
00:28:40.201 --> 00:28:41.400
<v Speaker 2>we're doing some shitty things.</v>

950
00:28:41.401 --> 00:28:41.971
<v Speaker 2>You know what though?</v>

951
00:28:41.971 --> 00:28:44.310
<v Speaker 2>No one I don't think anyone is thinking about.</v>

952
00:28:44.311 --> 00:28:44.731
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>

953
00:28:44.731 --> 00:28:45.660
<v Speaker 2>Even that's the thing.</v>

954
00:28:45.661 --> 00:28:48.780
<v Speaker 2>They're not even looking at everybody who's looking at it like you are,</v>

955
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:49.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

956
00:28:49.591 --> 00:28:50.490
<v Speaker 2>with an honest.</v>

957
00:28:50.491 --> 00:28:54.720
<v Speaker 2>I can see through all that and it's the result.</v>

958
00:28:54.721 --> 00:28:57.690
<v Speaker 2>It's the result of people not even think is as soon as you think on that level,</v>

959
00:28:57.691 --> 00:28:59.370
<v Speaker 2>you want to change it and really that's,</v>

960
00:28:59.371 --> 00:28:59.791
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

961
00:28:59.791 --> 00:29:00.624
<v Speaker 2>that's what this,</v>

962
00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:01.800
<v Speaker 2>this movement that,</v>

963
00:29:01.801 --> 00:29:03.960
<v Speaker 2>that we think of ourselves right now is a part of the,</v>

964
00:29:03.961 --> 00:29:04.720
<v Speaker 2>the level Lucian.</v>

965
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.420
<v Speaker 2>That's really our objective.</v>

966
00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that in the past they were able to get things off much easier so</v>

967
00:29:12.091 --> 00:29:17.040
<v Speaker 2>they have this sort of pattern of behavior and the way they do business as far</v>

968
00:29:17.041 --> 00:29:17.880
<v Speaker 2>as how we go to war,</v>

969
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:22.050
<v Speaker 2>like the Gulf of Tonkin type shit where they could get away with stuff like that</v>

970
00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:22.681
<v Speaker 2>in the past.</v>

971
00:29:22.681 --> 00:29:23.640
<v Speaker 2>But today with the,</v>

972
00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.610
<v Speaker 2>like the sort of the same group are basically in charge.</v>

973
00:29:26.611 --> 00:29:28.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean they've evolved somewhat,</v>

974
00:29:28.051 --> 00:29:30.120
<v Speaker 2>but I mean there's photos of Rumsfeld,</v>

975
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:31.610
<v Speaker 2>shaking hands with Saddam was saying,</v>

976
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:32.603
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean,</v>

977
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.370
<v Speaker 2>a long time ago when it was the Reagan administration,</v>

978
00:29:35.371 --> 00:29:36.204
<v Speaker 2>is that what it was from?</v>

979
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.560
<v Speaker 2>It was during the Iran,</v>

980
00:29:37.561 --> 00:29:38.394
<v Speaker 2>Iraq war.</v>

981
00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.480
<v Speaker 2>We're supporting Iran.</v>

982
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

983
00:29:40.651 --> 00:29:41.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

984
00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:41.241
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

985
00:29:41.241 --> 00:29:41.441
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

986
00:29:41.441 --> 00:29:41.861
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>

987
00:29:41.861 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 2>You know</v>

988
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.690
<v Speaker 4>what I gotta I gotTa stop myself there.</v>

989
00:29:43.691 --> 00:29:43.841
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

990
00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:44.980
<v Speaker 4>that's how fucked up this is.</v>

991
00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.510
<v Speaker 4>This is how ingrained it is in the paradigm.</v>

992
00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.051
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

993
00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:51.010
<v Speaker 4>even when I'm talking about the worst fucking shit that government does,</v>

994
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.450
<v Speaker 4>the most offensive shit I and I,</v>

995
00:29:53.451 --> 00:29:53.980
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

996
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.340
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

997
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:54.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

998
00:29:54.581 --> 00:29:54.681
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

999
00:29:54.681 --> 00:29:57.010

1000
00:29:57.011 --> 00:29:57.940
<v Speaker 4>for my audience sometimes,</v>

1001
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.260
<v Speaker 4>but I sat there all silly.</v>

1002
00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to,</v>

1003
00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:00.733
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have,</v>

1004
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have a curse jars.</v>

1005
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to put a curse jar.</v>

1006
00:30:03.071 --> 00:30:03.904
<v Speaker 4>And every time,</v>

1007
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.230
<v Speaker 4>every time I use status,</v>

1008
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.340
<v Speaker 4>collectivist language,</v>

1009
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:11.490
<v Speaker 4>every time I say to refer to myself as part of the evil federal government that</v>

1010
00:30:11.621 --> 00:30:12.520
<v Speaker 4>committed these crimes,</v>

1011
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:16.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to punish myself by putting a quarter in the real curse.</v>

1012
00:30:16.001 --> 00:30:20.250
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like something John Heifer do the ladder at the top of the ladder.</v>

1013
00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:23.800
<v Speaker 4>It really is a bunch of old white dudes with war money.</v>

1014
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:24.371
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1015
00:30:24.371 --> 00:30:25.420
<v Speaker 4>that's really what it is.</v>

1016
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.200
<v Speaker 4>Like when you look at the people that run Halliburton,</v>

1017
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:29.860
<v Speaker 4>you look at Dick Cheney and look at,</v>

1018
00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:30.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1019
00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.920
<v Speaker 4>this old white dudes with war money.</v>

1020
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're in the business of war.</v>

1021
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.660
<v Speaker 4>Really the percentage of the income that,</v>

1022
00:30:37.661 --> 00:30:38.650
<v Speaker 4>how Burton per,</v>

1023
00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.270
<v Speaker 4>how much they profit off of war.</v>

1024
00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.220
<v Speaker 4>That's a staggering number.</v>

1025
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.400
<v Speaker 4>As disgusting as that warm money is for Halliburton,</v>

1026
00:30:45.401 --> 00:30:47.470
<v Speaker 4>what it's really about as the bankster money,</v>

1027
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:50.830
<v Speaker 4>it's about the money that goes through the financial system that flows faster</v>

1028
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:52.030
<v Speaker 4>for war.</v>

1029
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.730
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1030
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:53.990
<v Speaker 4>but you know what this I have,</v>

1031
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:54.190
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>

1032
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.431
<v Speaker 4>let me,</v>

1033
00:30:54.431 --> 00:30:55.020
<v Speaker 4>let me tell you my,</v>

1034
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.790
<v Speaker 4>my long view perspective here because I'm much more optimistic and I,</v>

1035
00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:59.683
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1036
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.860
<v Speaker 4>when you understand government to be pathological behavior,</v>

1037
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:03.380
<v Speaker 4>it's our inner.</v>

1038
00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.350
<v Speaker 4>Whenever you say we need government for something,</v>

1039
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.720
<v Speaker 4>you're saying we can't solve this peacefully.</v>

1040
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.350
<v Speaker 4>We need to somehow as the majority impose our will on the minority or we need to</v>

1041
00:31:11.351 --> 00:31:15.020
<v Speaker 4>take money from people by force because they're not charitable enough or you</v>

1042
00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:15.220
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1043
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.350
<v Speaker 4>they don't care about their own defense and for whatever it is,</v>

1044
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:18.550
<v Speaker 4>we can't do it peacefully.</v>

1045
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:19.690
<v Speaker 4>We know we need,</v>

1046
00:31:19.691 --> 00:31:20.390
<v Speaker 4>we need force,</v>

1047
00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:20.770
<v Speaker 4>we need,</v>

1048
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:24.670
<v Speaker 4>we need coercion and it really comes out of the monkey brain.</v>

1049
00:31:24.671 --> 00:31:26.350
<v Speaker 4>It comes out of that.</v>

1050
00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.300
<v Speaker 4>When we evolved in the state of nature,</v>

1051
00:31:28.301 --> 00:31:31.540
<v Speaker 4>it was in our best interest that whoever was the biggest,</v>

1052
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:31.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1053
00:31:31.781 --> 00:31:35.980
<v Speaker 4>whoever could pick up the biggest rock was in charge and you go along to get</v>

1054
00:31:35.981 --> 00:31:36.311
<v Speaker 4>along.</v>

1055
00:31:36.311 --> 00:31:37.420
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise you don't eat tonight.</v>

1056
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.730
<v Speaker 4>And we're evolving past that.</v>

1057
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:40.713
<v Speaker 4>And as we just,</v>

1058
00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.260
<v Speaker 4>as we develop greater technological dominance over our environment,</v>

1059
00:31:44.261 --> 00:31:46.930
<v Speaker 4>as we are better able to process information,</v>

1060
00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:51.730
<v Speaker 4>all of these things are leading to the evolution towards a stateless society.</v>

1061
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:56.730
<v Speaker 4>We are evolving past this phase of statism and like you were saying about what</v>

1062
00:31:56.951 --> 00:31:59.020
<v Speaker 4>they get away with in war to answer your question,</v>

1063
00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:00.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1064
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:00.800
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1065
00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.930
<v Speaker 4>they get away with less.</v>

1066
00:32:01.931 --> 00:32:03.090
<v Speaker 4>It's harder to come up with an excuse.</v>

1067
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean look at now and it's really sad to see that we're marching toward Iran.</v>

1068
00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:09.730
<v Speaker 4>But I've made the prediction for awhile now that we'd see boots on the ground in</v>

1069
00:32:09.731 --> 00:32:14.290
<v Speaker 4>Syria first because it's much better propaganda to have a humanitarian war where</v>

1070
00:32:14.291 --> 00:32:17.530
<v Speaker 4>we can save a bunch of people from an evil dictator than,</v>

1071
00:32:17.531 --> 00:32:17.831
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1072
00:32:17.831 --> 00:32:21.880
<v Speaker 4>it's the clash of nations and we're trying to keep Iran from arming themselves</v>

1073
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:22.471
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>

1074
00:32:22.471 --> 00:32:23.740
<v Speaker 4>that propaganda is kind of wearing thin.</v>

1075
00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:24.231
<v Speaker 4>But it's scary.</v>

1076
00:32:24.231 --> 00:32:26.020
<v Speaker 4>And I will see they might get away with that.</v>

1077
00:32:26.021 --> 00:32:28.930
<v Speaker 4>They might get a war in Iran and it's all.</v>

1078
00:32:28.931 --> 00:32:29.501
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1079
00:32:29.501 --> 00:32:30.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean it,</v>

1080
00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:30.280
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1081
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:30.500
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1082
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.570
<v Speaker 4>but it's in the 21st century with the historical perspective that we have.</v>

1083
00:32:34.571 --> 00:32:37.000
<v Speaker 4>Is Warren just not fucking embarrassing at this point.</v>

1084
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:37.960
<v Speaker 4>It should be,</v>

1085
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.311
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1086
00:32:38.311 --> 00:32:39.260
<v Speaker 4>it's fascinating me.</v>

1087
00:32:39.261 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 4>Is this thing that's going</v>

1088
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.000
<v Speaker 5>on in Pakistan,</v>

1089
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.010
<v Speaker 5>if that isn't racist,</v>

1090
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:43.701
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1091
00:32:43.701 --> 00:32:48.040
<v Speaker 5>What is this flying of drones that shoot missiles and blow up citizen.</v>

1092
00:32:48.041 --> 00:32:48.681
<v Speaker 5>It's cowardly.</v>

1093
00:32:48.681 --> 00:32:49.880
<v Speaker 5>Obama's a fucking murderer.</v>

1094
00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:51.320
<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous.</v>

1095
00:32:51.321 --> 00:32:52.850
<v Speaker 5>The idea that we just accepted.</v>

1096
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:53.810
<v Speaker 5>I look,</v>

1097
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:57.320
<v Speaker 5>I believe you that there's some bad Taliban guys out there that want to commit</v>

1098
00:32:57.321 --> 00:32:58.820
<v Speaker 5>terrible things and we need to get to them,</v>

1099
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.220
<v Speaker 5>but you need to be a little bit more accurate bitch.</v>

1100
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:05.150
<v Speaker 5>You imagine if they were using those things in Germany or you know,</v>

1101
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.570
<v Speaker 5>or Japan or anywhere that we're allies with and you know,</v>

1102
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:10.130
<v Speaker 5>and it caused this kind of damage.</v>

1103
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.110
<v Speaker 5>But the fact that it's happening in Pakistan,</v>

1104
00:33:12.111 --> 00:33:12.440
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1105
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:12.561
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1106
00:33:12.561 --> 00:33:14.360
<v Speaker 5>it's brown people on the planet.</v>

1107
00:33:14.361 --> 00:33:14.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1108
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.450
<v Speaker 5>What do they doing?</v>

1109
00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:16.283
<v Speaker 5>They love their.</v>

1110
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:17.143
<v Speaker 5>Lost a donkey,</v>

1111
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:18.100
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1112
00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:18.933
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1113
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.401
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1114
00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:19.641
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1115
00:33:19.641 --> 00:33:20.520
<v Speaker 5>these poor folks,</v>

1116
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.250
<v Speaker 5>they're looking at them like they're,</v>

1117
00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:22.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1118
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.990
<v Speaker 5>they're living a shit life anyway.</v>

1119
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:24.981
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1120
00:33:24.981 --> 00:33:25.191
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1121
00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:27.960
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the things that they have done recently in,</v>

1122
00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:28.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1123
00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:29.331
<v Speaker 5>with the Taliban.</v>

1124
00:33:29.331 --> 00:33:32.540
<v Speaker 5>They've said that they're going to stop administering polio vaccines if they</v>

1125
00:33:32.541 --> 00:33:37.010
<v Speaker 5>don't stop the drone strikes because the ptsd that they are causing in the</v>

1126
00:33:37.011 --> 00:33:40.010
<v Speaker 5>population is worse than having fucking polio.</v>

1127
00:33:40.011 --> 00:33:40.370
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1128
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:41.030
<v Speaker 5>how citizens.</v>

1129
00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.170
<v Speaker 5>But I got a quote here.</v>

1130
00:33:42.171 --> 00:33:43.100
<v Speaker 5>This is Anwar Allah,</v>

1131
00:33:43.101 --> 00:33:48.101
<v Speaker 5>lucky the New Mexico born a man that was killed in Yemen by a drone strike by,</v>

1132
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:50.031
<v Speaker 5>by order,</v>

1133
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:50.571
<v Speaker 5>by Obama.</v>

1134
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:52.550
<v Speaker 5>His 16 year old son was also murdered.</v>

1135
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.000
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1136
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.520
<v Speaker 5>the same way a week later you probably heard that story of Abdul Ramond all</v>

1137
00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:58.400
<v Speaker 5>lucky and he was,</v>

1138
00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:01.820
<v Speaker 5>he was made out to be the great propagandist for al Qaeda.</v>

1139
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:02.380
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

1140
00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.380
<v Speaker 5>this is the quote from him.</v>

1141
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.710
<v Speaker 5>Our position needs to be reiterated and needs to be very clear.</v>

1142
00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:11.090
<v Speaker 5>The fact that the US has administered that death and homicide of over 1 million</v>

1143
00:34:11.091 --> 00:34:12.080
<v Speaker 5>civilians in Iraq.</v>

1144
00:34:12.081 --> 00:34:16.430
<v Speaker 5>The fact that the United States is supporting the deaths of killing of thousands</v>

1145
00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:20.210
<v Speaker 5>of Palestinians does not justify the killing of one US civilian in New York City</v>

1146
00:34:20.211 --> 00:34:21.190
<v Speaker 5>or Washington DC.</v>

1147
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.790
<v Speaker 5>And the deaths of 6,000 civilians in New York and Washington DC does not justify</v>

1148
00:34:25.791 --> 00:34:27.590
<v Speaker 5>the death of one civilian and Afghanistan.</v>

1149
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:32.240
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't sound like a terrorist.</v>

1150
00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.190
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like the guys making sense.</v>

1151
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:35.203
<v Speaker 5>No Shit.</v>

1152
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.330
<v Speaker 5>That's why I'm kind of afraid to be in this line of work myself.</v>

1153
00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:38.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1154
00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.970
<v Speaker 5>It's creepy line of work when they can just label you,</v>

1155
00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:41.620
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1156
00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:41.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1157
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:45.830
<v Speaker 5>no one wants to look at it from this side that perhaps the United States has</v>

1158
00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:46.820
<v Speaker 5>done some heinous things.</v>

1159
00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:51.830
<v Speaker 5>There's a reason why these people want to do something to us and we go us to,</v>

1160
00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:54.180
<v Speaker 5>to the citizens of this great nation.</v>

1161
00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:54.471
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

1162
00:34:54.471 --> 00:34:54.711
<v Speaker 5>In a way,</v>

1163
00:34:54.711 --> 00:34:59.711
<v Speaker 5>they're smarter than us because our reaction culturally is dehumanization.</v>

1164
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.490
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1165
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:02.690
<v Speaker 5>it's an implicit racism for us.</v>

1166
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.600
<v Speaker 5>They're smarter than they want it.</v>

1167
00:35:04.601 --> 00:35:06.560
<v Speaker 5>When they actually come at it strategically,</v>

1168
00:35:06.561 --> 00:35:08.750
<v Speaker 5>like they want to change our behavior,</v>

1169
00:35:08.751 --> 00:35:10.610
<v Speaker 5>they want us to stop bombing them.</v>

1170
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:10.910
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1171
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:11.790
<v Speaker 5>And maybe they're not good.</v>

1172
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:13.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm not endorsing terrorism obviously.</v>

1173
00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.620
<v Speaker 5>But if anything,</v>

1174
00:35:15.621 --> 00:35:19.670
<v Speaker 5>their anger is much more aware and directed at the US government.</v>

1175
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.391
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1176
00:35:20.391 --> 00:35:22.580
<v Speaker 5>my whole positions that were not innocent,</v>

1177
00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1178
00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:23.231
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1179
00:35:23.231 --> 00:35:24.350
<v Speaker 5>the United States government,</v>

1180
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:25.530
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

1181
00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:26.160
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1182
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.410
<v Speaker 5>whatever's over there,</v>

1183
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.460
<v Speaker 5>we're not as innocent.</v>

1184
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:29.323
<v Speaker 5>It's that simple.</v>

1185
00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.480
<v Speaker 5>So if we're not innocent,</v>

1186
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:34.640
<v Speaker 5>we have to take some sort of responsibility where they have to take some sort of</v>

1187
00:35:34.641 --> 00:35:36.170
<v Speaker 5>responsibility for the repercussions.</v>

1188
00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 5>If you're doing that's fucked up and</v>

1189
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.880
<v Speaker 4>people are dying,</v>

1190
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:40.320
<v Speaker 4>you got to know that you've,</v>

1191
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.930
<v Speaker 4>you've done something terrible and you need to make amends,</v>

1192
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:43.261
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1193
00:35:43.261 --> 00:35:44.790
<v Speaker 4>you need to fix this whole thing.</v>

1194
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:47.160
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't just to get out of there now.</v>

1195
00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:51.420
<v Speaker 4>He can't just get out of there and leave it behind some fucking crazy civil war.</v>

1196
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:55.000
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the denial that America is in and if I may,</v>

1197
00:35:55.001 --> 00:35:59.700
<v Speaker 4>the next part of my story was coming back from Iraq and in trouble with this,</v>

1198
00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.650
<v Speaker 4>trying to go back to get a purple heart.</v>

1199
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:06.060
<v Speaker 4>And when I got out of the Marines I had been as a sergeant who spoke Arabic,</v>

1200
00:36:06.061 --> 00:36:07.230
<v Speaker 4>was civil affairs experience.</v>

1201
00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:11.190
<v Speaker 4>Pissed off because I was managing a barracks and mowing lawns for most of the</v>

1202
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.670
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

1203
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:14.040
<v Speaker 4>And I got out and I was disgruntled.</v>

1204
00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:18.450
<v Speaker 4>It was like the day after I got a medal for heroism under fire and all the other</v>

1205
00:36:18.451 --> 00:36:20.940
<v Speaker 4>crap that I got cited for when I was in Fallujah.</v>

1206
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.560
<v Speaker 4>That took three years to process.</v>

1207
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.300
<v Speaker 4>They busted me down from sergeant corporal and I got out and I was in my,</v>

1208
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:26.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1209
00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.370
<v Speaker 4>the exploration of my.</v>

1210
00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:30.360
<v Speaker 4>Do they do that from bringing the pistol back?</v>

1211
00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:30.930
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1212
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.810
<v Speaker 4>because if it got through the system and got back to NCI and Yada Yada,</v>

1213
00:36:33.811 --> 00:36:34.021
<v Speaker 4>Yada.</v>

1214
00:36:34.021 --> 00:36:35.340
<v Speaker 4>So I got in trouble for that.</v>

1215
00:36:35.341 --> 00:36:36.750
<v Speaker 4>So you never got that pistol back?</v>

1216
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:37.613
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1217
00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:38.240
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1218
00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:38.520
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1219
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:38.850
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1220
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:40.450
<v Speaker 4>but I did get to fire it a couple of times.</v>

1221
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:41.880
<v Speaker 4>Pistol.</v>

1222
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.900
<v Speaker 4>Well an official gift from the regime or something like that.</v>

1223
00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:47.820
<v Speaker 4>But it was the coolest orical piece I got.</v>

1224
00:36:47.821 --> 00:36:48.810
<v Speaker 4>I got plenty of guns now.</v>

1225
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:55.260
<v Speaker 4>But this is an important thing about who is going to be on the front lines of</v>

1226
00:36:55.261 --> 00:36:56.610
<v Speaker 4>this revolution right now.</v>

1227
00:36:56.611 --> 00:37:00.870
<v Speaker 4>They were facing who was going to help us evolve past this status paradigm.</v>

1228
00:37:00.871 --> 00:37:04.950
<v Speaker 4>Who's going to help us push past and see past the collapse of government because</v>

1229
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.700
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to be the people that the system treats well and this whole thing</v>

1230
00:37:08.701 --> 00:37:09.150
<v Speaker 4>is set up.</v>

1231
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:11.490
<v Speaker 4>You have the propagandizing class,</v>

1232
00:37:11.491 --> 00:37:11.701
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1233
00:37:11.701 --> 00:37:11.891
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1234
00:37:11.891 --> 00:37:12.121
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1235
00:37:12.121 --> 00:37:13.980
<v Speaker 4>you have the dependent class,</v>

1236
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:18.981
<v Speaker 4>you have the enforcement class and the law enforcement in the military and you</v>

1237
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.290
<v Speaker 4>have people that are bought into the system as a whole,</v>

1238
00:37:22.291 --> 00:37:22.531
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1239
00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:23.730
<v Speaker 4>whole variety of levels in a way.</v>

1240
00:37:23.731 --> 00:37:26.190
<v Speaker 4>That's how they get away with is they make everybody think they're,</v>

1241
00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.180
<v Speaker 4>they're benefiting from it.</v>

1242
00:37:27.181 --> 00:37:28.650
<v Speaker 4>And they have people you know.</v>

1243
00:37:28.651 --> 00:37:30.680
<v Speaker 4>And it's like if capitalism,</v>

1244
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.770
<v Speaker 4>a true free market,</v>

1245
00:37:31.771 --> 00:37:35.680
<v Speaker 4>unnatural society where people have property rights is like a rough fabric when</v>

1246
00:37:35.681 --> 00:37:35.771
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1247
00:37:35.771 --> 00:37:38.250
<v Speaker 4>when you introduced the Federal Reserve and you have this thing that can create</v>

1248
00:37:38.251 --> 00:37:39.120
<v Speaker 4>money out of thin air,</v>

1249
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:43.350
<v Speaker 4>it's like pulling it up and create an unnatural spike and concentration of</v>

1250
00:37:43.351 --> 00:37:44.041
<v Speaker 4>wealth and power.</v>

1251
00:37:44.041 --> 00:37:45.840
<v Speaker 4>And we have this illusion of capitalism.</v>

1252
00:37:45.841 --> 00:37:47.370
<v Speaker 4>Like we can own property and we can trade,</v>

1253
00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.040
<v Speaker 4>but it's this whole spike where everybody is,</v>

1254
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:50.551
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1255
00:37:50.551 --> 00:37:51.990
<v Speaker 4>kind of picked up along with it.</v>

1256
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:56.990
<v Speaker 4>And this illusion of being able to print money that's worth something and that's</v>

1257
00:37:57.091 --> 00:37:59.670
<v Speaker 4>how they manipulate the economy and that's what people really get screwed.</v>

1258
00:37:59.671 --> 00:38:03.560
<v Speaker 4>But the first people that are going to be questioning the system aren't going to</v>

1259
00:38:03.561 --> 00:38:07.440
<v Speaker 4>be the guy that was student body president or captain of the football squad or</v>

1260
00:38:07.441 --> 00:38:08.610
<v Speaker 4>the cheerleading team,</v>

1261
00:38:08.611 --> 00:38:08.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1262
00:38:08.881 --> 00:38:12.420
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be the miscreants and the punks and the and the misfits.</v>

1263
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.130
<v Speaker 4>And the people that were,</v>

1264
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.941
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1265
00:38:14.941 --> 00:38:19.120
<v Speaker 4>in a sense challenging authority naturally because they had something in it or</v>

1266
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:20.310
<v Speaker 4>they had something in their life.</v>

1267
00:38:20.311 --> 00:38:23.790
<v Speaker 4>And the thing is right now it's about being a victim of government.</v>

1268
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:24.690
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1269
00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:26.820
<v Speaker 4>how many people do you know that that got arrested?</v>

1270
00:38:26.821 --> 00:38:27.710
<v Speaker 4>And when they got arrested they,</v>

1271
00:38:27.711 --> 00:38:27.851
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1272
00:38:27.851 --> 00:38:29.010
<v Speaker 4>they turned political.</v>

1273
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.840
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1274
00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.630
<v Speaker 4>they started paying attention because it hits home and they stopped trusting</v>

1275
00:38:33.631 --> 00:38:33.990
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

1276
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:35.290
<v Speaker 4>And that's a really important thing.</v>

1277
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.780
<v Speaker 4>And the rest of us have to stop turning a blind eye.</v>

1278
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.141
<v Speaker 4>And I say,</v>

1279
00:38:38.141 --> 00:38:38.711
<v Speaker 4>the rest of us,</v>

1280
00:38:38.711 --> 00:38:39.460
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1281
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.110
<v Speaker 4>maybe a bad collectivizing term,</v>

1282
00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:44.770
<v Speaker 4>but the people that are asleep to this need to stop turning a blind eye and</v>

1283
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:44.981
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

1284
00:38:44.981 --> 00:38:45.251
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1285
00:38:45.251 --> 00:38:46.090
<v Speaker 4>I got mine.</v>

1286
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.223
<v Speaker 4>I'm cool.</v>

1287
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:50.260
<v Speaker 4>I got my paycheck because somebody else was getting fucked.</v>

1288
00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:54.610
<v Speaker 4>And the thing is that it's so exciting is that enough people have been fucked.</v>

1289
00:38:54.611 --> 00:38:58.870
<v Speaker 4>Now that it's coming to a critical mass where people are questioning the</v>

1290
00:38:58.871 --> 00:38:59.201
<v Speaker 4>government,</v>

1291
00:38:59.201 --> 00:39:00.011
<v Speaker 4>people are waking up,</v>

1292
00:39:00.011 --> 00:39:02.290
<v Speaker 4>people are saying we don't need this thing anymore.</v>

1293
00:39:02.291 --> 00:39:03.760
<v Speaker 4>We are standing up to the bully.</v>

1294
00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:04.950
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's so fun about,</v>

1295
00:39:04.951 --> 00:39:05.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1296
00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.610
<v Speaker 4>what I do now in civil disobedience.</v>

1297
00:39:06.611 --> 00:39:07.810
<v Speaker 4>Speaking of which did,</v>

1298
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:12.460
<v Speaker 4>did you get my invitation to the party yesterday?</v>

1299
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:13.623
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1300
00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.550
<v Speaker 4>well we had a really exciting event and this is a civil disobedience beach</v>

1301
00:39:18.551 --> 00:39:19.270
<v Speaker 4>party.</v>

1302
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:20.800
<v Speaker 4>We went to like a beach party.</v>

1303
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:21.590
<v Speaker 4>We went to the.</v>

1304
00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:21.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1305
00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.691
<v Speaker 4>I know in a sense,</v>

1306
00:39:22.691 --> 00:39:24.130
<v Speaker 4>but oh man,</v>

1307
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:25.011
<v Speaker 4>we know it's,</v>

1308
00:39:25.011 --> 00:39:25.201
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1309
00:39:25.201 --> 00:39:28.270
<v Speaker 4>it's where you deliberately go and break as many laws nonviolently as you</v>

1310
00:39:28.271 --> 00:39:28.991
<v Speaker 4>possibly can.</v>

1311
00:39:28.991 --> 00:39:29.910
<v Speaker 4>And so we dug holes deep,</v>

1312
00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:34.060
<v Speaker 4>deeper than 18 inches and we smoked pot without a license and we threw footballs</v>

1313
00:39:34.061 --> 00:39:38.590
<v Speaker 4>and frisbees and it not allowed to throw footballs and Frisbees at the Santa</v>

1314
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:38.650
<v Speaker 4>Monica Pier.</v>

1315
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:39.480
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1316
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.313
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1317
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:40.961
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1318
00:39:40.961 --> 00:39:41.380
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

1319
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.213
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1320
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:43.750
<v Speaker 4>No frisbees.</v>

1321
00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:43.931
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1322
00:39:43.931 --> 00:39:44.161
<v Speaker 4>But see,</v>

1323
00:39:44.161 --> 00:39:44.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1324
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:44.820
<v Speaker 4>what's your,</v>

1325
00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.180
<v Speaker 4>what's your normal reaction to that?</v>

1326
00:39:46.181 --> 00:39:46.390
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

1327
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.900
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>

1328
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:47.740
<v Speaker 4>What's another law?</v>

1329
00:39:47.741 --> 00:39:49.240
<v Speaker 4>And you walk away and he's so stupid.</v>

1330
00:39:49.241 --> 00:39:49.510
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

1331
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.961
<v Speaker 4>people are.</v>

1332
00:39:49.961 --> 00:39:51.220
<v Speaker 4>And this is really petty.</v>

1333
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.970
<v Speaker 4>Well the real problem is country kids that throw those fucking frisbees too hard</v>

1334
00:39:54.971 --> 00:39:55.870
<v Speaker 4>and they hit babies.</v>

1335
00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:00.380
<v Speaker 4>So the answer is to have police go and try to chase them down and issue them</v>

1336
00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:00.700
<v Speaker 4>thousand dollars ticket.</v>

1337
00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.670
<v Speaker 4>So the answer is you got to go back in time to when their parents aren't seeing</v>

1338
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.580
<v Speaker 4>them and then work with the parents.</v>

1339
00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:09.790
<v Speaker 4>Try to straighten out with their emotional bullshit to make them a shitty parent</v>

1340
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:13.900
<v Speaker 4>so that they can deliver a kid that's better functioning in society.</v>

1341
00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:14.141
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1342
00:40:14.141 --> 00:40:14.770
<v Speaker 4>So let me know.</v>

1343
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:16.780
<v Speaker 4>That kid is all fucked up.</v>

1344
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:17.890
<v Speaker 4>You got to deal with them.</v>

1345
00:40:17.891 --> 00:40:19.300
<v Speaker 4>Somebody made a fucked up kid,</v>

1346
00:40:19.301 --> 00:40:20.290
<v Speaker 4>lit that fucked up kid.</v>

1347
00:40:20.291 --> 00:40:23.710
<v Speaker 4>Get loose and he's whipping a frisbee around near your two year old baby.</v>

1348
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:24.101
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1349
00:40:24.101 --> 00:40:26.140
<v Speaker 4>but this is why things are getting better.</v>

1350
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:26.730
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

1351
00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:30.910
<v Speaker 4>this is the site because people want to be better parents and pathological</v>

1352
00:40:30.911 --> 00:40:31.331
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>

1353
00:40:31.331 --> 00:40:33.310
<v Speaker 4>Why do people grow up to be violent criminals?</v>

1354
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.830
<v Speaker 4>It's usually because they were abused as children in some way.</v>

1355
00:40:35.831 --> 00:40:36.191
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

1356
00:40:36.191 --> 00:40:36.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1357
00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:36.630
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1358
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.890
<v Speaker 4>it's emotional abuse or physical abuse,</v>

1359
00:40:38.891 --> 00:40:40.750
<v Speaker 4>but people aren't naturally violent.</v>

1360
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:41.710
<v Speaker 4>People are.</v>

1361
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:44.620
<v Speaker 4>The natural state is to want to cooperate with fellow human beings.</v>

1362
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:47.680
<v Speaker 4>At least that's what we're evolving towards and so think about it.</v>

1363
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:48.610
<v Speaker 4>Like right now,</v>

1364
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:52.060
<v Speaker 4>compared to the state of nature 200,000 years ago,</v>

1365
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:53.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1366
00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:57.490
<v Speaker 4>everybody had to work 16 hours a day hunting and gathering to survive,</v>

1367
00:40:57.491 --> 00:40:58.030
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1368
00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:01.990
<v Speaker 4>And now the average American can work from when they're 22 to 65,</v>

1369
00:41:01.991 --> 00:41:05.710
<v Speaker 4>eight hours a day with weekends and vacation time and support a whole family for</v>

1370
00:41:05.711 --> 00:41:06.700
<v Speaker 4>their lifetime on that.</v>

1371
00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:08.200
<v Speaker 4>And if anything,</v>

1372
00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.290
<v Speaker 4>it would be a lot less than that with,</v>

1373
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.450
<v Speaker 4>with without the central banking system that we have today without the systems</v>

1374
00:41:13.451 --> 00:41:14.470
<v Speaker 4>of government exploitation,</v>

1375
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.940
<v Speaker 4>robbing that exponential growth,</v>

1376
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:19.460
<v Speaker 4>what should be exponential growth and quality of life and it's,</v>

1377
00:41:19.461 --> 00:41:20.350
<v Speaker 4>it's still exponential,</v>

1378
00:41:20.351 --> 00:41:24.430
<v Speaker 4>but not nearly as much as it should be and what we're coming to like how are you</v>

1379
00:41:24.431 --> 00:41:28.720
<v Speaker 4>going to convince people that you need a welfare state when you can work for one</v>

1380
00:41:28.721 --> 00:41:32.290
<v Speaker 4>year and save enough money to live at the quality of life that we enjoy today</v>

1381
00:41:32.291 --> 00:41:33.320
<v Speaker 4>for the rest of your life.</v>

1382
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.150
<v Speaker 4>That's</v>

1383
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.350
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1384
00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:34.590
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1385
00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:35.423
<v Speaker 5>and to me,</v>

1386
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.580
<v Speaker 5>that's what makes this such an exciting time to be alive.</v>

1387
00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.670
<v Speaker 5>And you just look at,</v>

1388
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:42.140
<v Speaker 5>look at how much less violence there is and this is a really beautiful thing.</v>

1389
00:41:42.141 --> 00:41:44.840
<v Speaker 5>You can look at government and be pissed off all you want.</v>

1390
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:46.560
<v Speaker 5>And this is where I've come to now,</v>

1391
00:41:46.561 --> 00:41:50.000
<v Speaker 5>hour as a zen libertarian is being able to see this big,</v>

1392
00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:54.420
<v Speaker 5>bigger picture and that the actual average amount of violence that an individual</v>

1393
00:41:54.421 --> 00:41:58.940
<v Speaker 5>is subject to is at an all time historic low for as long as we've been able to</v>

1394
00:41:58.941 --> 00:41:59.331
<v Speaker 5>track it.</v>

1395
00:41:59.331 --> 00:42:00.380
<v Speaker 5>That's part of that evolution.</v>

1396
00:42:00.381 --> 00:42:05.120
<v Speaker 5>This is the natural development of life from single celled organisms,</v>

1397
00:42:05.121 --> 00:42:05.591
<v Speaker 5>from you know,</v>

1398
00:42:05.591 --> 00:42:08.810
<v Speaker 5>little molecules bouncing around in the primordial soup together.</v>

1399
00:42:08.811 --> 00:42:12.830
<v Speaker 5>The essence of life is cooperation is pooling of resources you know,</v>

1400
00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:16.130
<v Speaker 5>of coming together of energy coming into harmony.</v>

1401
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.840
<v Speaker 5>And that's what we're going through.</v>

1402
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.390
<v Speaker 5>And we're seeing this process of two steps forward.</v>

1403
00:42:20.391 --> 00:42:21.171
<v Speaker 5>One step backwards,</v>

1404
00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:23.300
<v Speaker 5>and we're in the middle of a big step backwards right now.</v>

1405
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:27.050
<v Speaker 5>That really is centered around the institutionalization of the Federal Reserve</v>

1406
00:42:27.051 --> 00:42:29.660
<v Speaker 5>and the modern systems of government going back about 100 years.</v>

1407
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:30.980
<v Speaker 5>And within that time,</v>

1408
00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:31.131
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1409
00:42:31.131 --> 00:42:32.210
<v Speaker 5>we've had steps forwards,</v>

1410
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:33.321
<v Speaker 5>gay rights movement,</v>

1411
00:42:33.321 --> 00:42:34.310
<v Speaker 5>the women's rights movement,</v>

1412
00:42:34.311 --> 00:42:35.330
<v Speaker 5>the civil rights movement.</v>

1413
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.400
<v Speaker 5>Not In how they were institutionalized in government,</v>

1414
00:42:37.401 --> 00:42:38.000
<v Speaker 5>but how they,</v>

1415
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.800
<v Speaker 5>what they represented for society.</v>

1416
00:42:39.801 --> 00:42:40.790
<v Speaker 5>We're steps forward,</v>

1417
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:46.310
<v Speaker 5>but we're coming to this major step forward now when we get past this entire</v>

1418
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.970
<v Speaker 5>paradigm of statism and it's a beautiful thing to see that as we're able to</v>

1419
00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:55.130
<v Speaker 5>raise our children nonviolently as we're able to be better parents because we</v>

1420
00:42:55.311 --> 00:42:58.460
<v Speaker 5>have better prosperity and better just the leisure time,</v>

1421
00:42:58.461 --> 00:43:01.250
<v Speaker 5>the ability to do things that the cave men couldn't do,</v>

1422
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:05.810
<v Speaker 5>and raise children that are emotionally well balanced and don't engage in this</v>

1423
00:43:05.811 --> 00:43:07.550
<v Speaker 5>pathological behavior that has government.</v>

1424
00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:08.390
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1425
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1426
00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.220
<v Speaker 5>I agree that it seems that if you,</v>

1427
00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:11.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1428
00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:12.330
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1429
00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:17.300
<v Speaker 5>you measure our time on earth in comparison to the Greeks or the Romans or</v>

1430
00:43:17.301 --> 00:43:19.640
<v Speaker 5>anybody lived in any sort of an ancient civilization like,</v>

1431
00:43:19.641 --> 00:43:19.820
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1432
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:23.000
<v Speaker 5>no one's ever had it as good as we have as far as the less violence,</v>

1433
00:43:23.001 --> 00:43:23.834
<v Speaker 5>the more health,</v>

1434
00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:25.280
<v Speaker 5>the more pleasure.</v>

1435
00:43:25.281 --> 00:43:27.110
<v Speaker 5>It's like the people being nice to each other.</v>

1436
00:43:27.111 --> 00:43:29.900
<v Speaker 5>People understanding the impact of being nice to each other.</v>

1437
00:43:29.901 --> 00:43:32.750
<v Speaker 5>Actually understanding what that's all about now.</v>

1438
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:34.340
<v Speaker 5>That's never happened before.</v>

1439
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:35.900
<v Speaker 5>But the way it's happening now,</v>

1440
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:38.510
<v Speaker 5>Americans are factors were like citizens of the empire,</v>

1441
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:39.110
<v Speaker 5>but the.</v>

1442
00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:39.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1443
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:42.410
<v Speaker 5>but if you look at the rest of the world though,</v>

1444
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:47.440
<v Speaker 5>if you look at especially the impact on some of the things that are necessary in</v>

1445
00:43:48.501 --> 00:43:53.501
<v Speaker 5>order to produce the amount of power that's necessary to run this crazy sort of</v>

1446
00:43:54.591 --> 00:43:55.550
<v Speaker 5>a peaceful,</v>

1447
00:43:55.551 --> 00:43:59.210
<v Speaker 5>easy go and country that we think of as America or you drive around,</v>

1448
00:43:59.211 --> 00:44:00.950
<v Speaker 5>there's really not that much crime drive around.</v>

1449
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:01.970
<v Speaker 5>It's really not that much violence.</v>

1450
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:02.930
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1451
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:03.290
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>

1452
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:04.730
<v Speaker 5>how were you driving on gas?</v>

1453
00:44:04.731 --> 00:44:05.690
<v Speaker 5>Where's that gas coming from?</v>

1454
00:44:05.691 --> 00:44:06.020
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

1455
00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:11.020
<v Speaker 5>the gas is coming from a place that's getting bombed from the sky with missiles</v>

1456
00:44:11.121 --> 00:44:13.580
<v Speaker 5>and that's where we have apartment buildings or blowing up.</v>

1457
00:44:13.581 --> 00:44:13.911
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1458
00:44:13.911 --> 00:44:14.021
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1459
00:44:14.021 --> 00:44:14.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1460
00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:15.920
<v Speaker 5>People are dying left and right,</v>

1461
00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:16.941
<v Speaker 5>so it's.</v>

1462
00:44:16.941 --> 00:44:17.200
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

1463
00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:17.660
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

1464
00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:21.980
<v Speaker 5>Is it possible to have all that shit without all the bad shit?</v>

1465
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.750
<v Speaker 5>Is it even possible to have in this day and age or is this like an over clock</v>

1466
00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:27.584
<v Speaker 5>society,</v>

1467
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:31.920
<v Speaker 5>is the only way to have a society like America possible is they're at</v>

1468
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:36.720
<v Speaker 4>the very top of the food chain doing all sorts of fucked up on ethical shit or</v>

1469
00:44:36.721 --> 00:44:41.721
<v Speaker 4>is it possible to have the control over the resources that we have and still be</v>

1470
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:46.941
<v Speaker 4>ethical as it possible to run a society like this and not do anything fucked up?</v>

1471
00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:54.270
<v Speaker 4>I think even the way that you're asking that question is reinforcing the idea of</v>

1472
00:44:54.271 --> 00:44:55.400
<v Speaker 4>a country and I am right.</v>

1473
00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:57.720
<v Speaker 4>Anything that's going to eventually completely go away.</v>

1474
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:58.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1475
00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:58.320
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1476
00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:58.860
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1477
00:44:58.860 --> 00:44:59.121
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

1478
00:44:59.121 --> 00:44:59.280
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1479
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.670
<v Speaker 4>it represents the framework from which you're coming from.</v>

1480
00:45:02.671 --> 00:45:06.770
<v Speaker 4>This represents the status paradigm of,</v>

1481
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:07.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1482
00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1483
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.900
<v Speaker 4>how do we have an identity or how do we have a society when you're using</v>

1484
00:45:12.901 --> 00:45:13.830
<v Speaker 4>government in,</v>

1485
00:45:13.831 --> 00:45:16.410
<v Speaker 4>in a way that doesn't clearly define it,</v>

1486
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:18.270
<v Speaker 4>and when you really break it down,</v>

1487
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:22.350
<v Speaker 4>the only clear way to define government is a group of people within arbitrary,</v>

1488
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:26.880
<v Speaker 4>geographically based monopoly on the initiation of force.</v>

1489
00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:27.410
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1490
00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:28.260
<v Speaker 4>that's what sets them apart.</v>

1491
00:45:28.261 --> 00:45:30.000
<v Speaker 4>Like if I go in and say,</v>

1492
00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:30.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1493
00:45:30.361 --> 00:45:31.230
<v Speaker 4>put a gun to your head and say,</v>

1494
00:45:31.231 --> 00:45:31.831
<v Speaker 4>give me your wallet,</v>

1495
00:45:31.831 --> 00:45:32.191
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

1496
00:45:32.191 --> 00:45:32.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1497
00:45:32.401 --> 00:45:33.234
<v Speaker 4>that that's wrong,</v>

1498
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.190
<v Speaker 4>or you can't be a gang member.</v>

1499
00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.320
<v Speaker 4>But if you're in a war with another gang and say,</v>

1500
00:45:37.321 --> 00:45:37.740
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1501
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:38.970
<v Speaker 4>these guys aren't murderers.</v>

1502
00:45:38.971 --> 00:45:39.241
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1503
00:45:39.241 --> 00:45:39.571
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1504
00:45:39.571 --> 00:45:40.530
<v Speaker 4>they're in my army.</v>

1505
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:43.050
<v Speaker 4>I made them go to war with the bad gang.</v>

1506
00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.620
<v Speaker 4>Exactly what the fuck you talking about?</v>

1507
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:45.190
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1508
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:46.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean generally police,</v>

1509
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1510
00:45:46.861 --> 00:45:47.240
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

1511
00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.700
<v Speaker 4>it's what's sick is that we have to extricate,</v>

1512
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:51.160
<v Speaker 4>we have to,</v>

1513
00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:55.710
<v Speaker 4>we have to pull out these legitimate functions of government in order to get rid</v>

1514
00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:55.891
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>

1515
00:45:55.891 --> 00:45:57.990
<v Speaker 4>Like it's really tricky with the police state.</v>

1516
00:45:57.991 --> 00:45:59.280
<v Speaker 4>It's an issue I'm really passionate about.</v>

1517
00:45:59.281 --> 00:45:59.430
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1518
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:03.150
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I'm kind of put me on the map was the Jefferson dance</v>

1519
00:46:03.151 --> 00:46:06.750
<v Speaker 4>party wouldn't when I got picked up and body slammed by a police officer,</v>

1520
00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.700
<v Speaker 4>the Jefferson Memorial for dancing in public.</v>

1521
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:10.260
<v Speaker 4>And that was,</v>

1522
00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:10.720
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

1523
00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:10.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1524
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:11.761
<v Speaker 4>that's my video.</v>

1525
00:46:11.761 --> 00:46:13.590
<v Speaker 4>That's got over a million views.</v>

1526
00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:16.230
<v Speaker 4>Police pull that shit up.</v>

1527
00:46:16.231 --> 00:46:16.680
<v Speaker 4>Brian.</v>

1528
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.490
<v Speaker 4>Where's Brian?</v>

1529
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:18.420
<v Speaker 4>But he's Outta here.</v>

1530
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.340
<v Speaker 4>You can't get it from the sound anyways,</v>

1531
00:46:20.341 --> 00:46:21.870
<v Speaker 4>but vanished.</v>

1532
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:22.531
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1533
00:46:22.531 --> 00:46:25.080
<v Speaker 4>police officers do serve a legitimate function.</v>

1534
00:46:25.081 --> 00:46:27.540
<v Speaker 4>The problem is that they've got a government monopoly on it,</v>

1535
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:28.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1536
00:46:28.351 --> 00:46:29.760
<v Speaker 4>that they provide for the public safety.</v>

1537
00:46:29.761 --> 00:46:34.500
<v Speaker 4>But private security is obviously much better and when you have this monopoly</v>

1538
00:46:34.501 --> 00:46:34.891
<v Speaker 4>power,</v>

1539
00:46:34.891 --> 00:46:36.150
<v Speaker 4>they're not accountable to the people.</v>

1540
00:46:36.151 --> 00:46:37.980
<v Speaker 4>There's always that detachment and it's,</v>

1541
00:46:37.981 --> 00:46:38.560
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>

1542
00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.750
<v Speaker 4>the idea of government.</v>

1543
00:46:39.751 --> 00:46:40.290
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>

1544
00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:41.760
<v Speaker 4>do we need government for society?</v>

1545
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:44.250
<v Speaker 4>It's a government is antithetical to society.</v>

1546
00:46:44.251 --> 00:46:48.060
<v Speaker 4>If Society is defined as how people come up with an identity and come together</v>

1547
00:46:48.061 --> 00:46:51.570
<v Speaker 4>peacefully and cooperatively and engage in commerce and do productive things.</v>

1548
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:52.583
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

1549
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:53.590
<v Speaker 4>you know how,</v>

1550
00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:54.830
<v Speaker 4>how do you say,</v>

1551
00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:57.300
<v Speaker 4>how do you live healthy with a giant Leech on your back?</v>

1552
00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:57.531
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1553
00:46:57.531 --> 00:46:58.410
<v Speaker 4>is that essential?</v>

1554
00:46:58.560 --> 00:46:58.861
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

1555
00:46:58.861 --> 00:46:58.971
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1556
00:46:58.971 --> 00:46:59.031
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1557
00:46:59.031 --> 00:46:59.130
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1558
00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.200
<v Speaker 4>you're in this government has to be a leach.</v>

1559
00:47:01.201 --> 00:47:02.100
<v Speaker 4>That's the question.</v>

1560
00:47:02.101 --> 00:47:03.720
<v Speaker 4>Is government have to be that?</v>

1561
00:47:03.721 --> 00:47:06.930
<v Speaker 4>Is it possible to have a government where it's just,</v>

1562
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:07.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1563
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:12.470
<v Speaker 4>we have a set of values that we put in place in order to help society run better</v>

1564
00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:18.120
<v Speaker 4>and that's we all take place in it and we call that government could be not</v>

1565
00:47:18.121 --> 00:47:18.511
<v Speaker 4>elite,</v>

1566
00:47:18.511 --> 00:47:22.320
<v Speaker 4>but it can never by definition be moral and will always then give someone an</v>

1567
00:47:22.321 --> 00:47:23.940
<v Speaker 4>unjust power that is corrupting.</v>

1568
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:25.110
<v Speaker 4>I got to see this video,</v>

1569
00:47:25.111 --> 00:47:25.944
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1570
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:27.510
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>

1571
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:28.343
<v Speaker 4>where's Brian?</v>

1572
00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:29.800
<v Speaker 4>You'll want me to vamp</v>

1573
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:33.783
<v Speaker 6>Brian.</v>

1574
00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:38.443
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1575
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:41.960
<v Speaker 4>This is Adam [inaudible] taking over the Joe Rogan experience podcast.</v>

1576
00:47:41.961 --> 00:47:42.920
<v Speaker 4>Thank you very much.</v>

1577
00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:46.493
<v Speaker 6>Hm.</v>

1578
00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:48.373
<v Speaker 4>Dustin,</v>

1579
00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.010
<v Speaker 4>Dustin,</v>

1580
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.850
<v Speaker 4>Dustin is here.</v>

1581
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:52.250
<v Speaker 4>Mild coproducer from the radio show.</v>

1582
00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.900
<v Speaker 4>They want to send them a text message to them to get back in there.</v>

1583
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:59.360
<v Speaker 4>So explain to me what happened to you.</v>

1584
00:47:59.361 --> 00:48:00.960
<v Speaker 4>They picked you up and body slammed you.</v>

1585
00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:01.371
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1586
00:48:01.371 --> 00:48:01.580
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1587
00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:01.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1588
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:02.930
<v Speaker 4>did you want to see a video?</v>

1589
00:48:02.931 --> 00:48:03.764
<v Speaker 4>Man?</v>

1590
00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:05.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to see in it</v>

1591
00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.260
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1592
00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:11.390
<v Speaker 4>So it's a bit of a story as it goes back,</v>

1593
00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:12.890
<v Speaker 4>like three or four years ago,</v>

1594
00:48:12.891 --> 00:48:15.560
<v Speaker 4>there was a group of 18 people that were just a bunch of Libertarian activist</v>

1595
00:48:15.561 --> 00:48:17.000
<v Speaker 4>that like Thomas Jefferson.</v>

1596
00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.330
<v Speaker 4>And so they wanted to go dance because he was the dancing president.</v>

1597
00:48:20.331 --> 00:48:22.300
<v Speaker 4>I didn't find out about this until after the incident.</v>

1598
00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:27.170
<v Speaker 4>My facebook wall got just covered with all these Jefferson quotes about how he</v>

1599
00:48:27.171 --> 00:48:30.170
<v Speaker 4>liked to dance and bust out the fiddle at the White House and stuff like that.</v>

1600
00:48:30.171 --> 00:48:34.340
<v Speaker 4>But they went and danced at midnight on Thomas Jefferson's birthday just as a</v>

1601
00:48:34.341 --> 00:48:35.600
<v Speaker 4>little flash mob thing.</v>

1602
00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:36.290
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1603
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:41.210
<v Speaker 4>And the security guards came and start trying try to shoo them out of the</v>

1604
00:48:41.211 --> 00:48:42.044
<v Speaker 4>memorial.</v>

1605
00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.930
<v Speaker 4>And one of them was dancing out and got arrested.</v>

1606
00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:45.861
<v Speaker 4>And they were like,</v>

1607
00:48:45.861 --> 00:48:47.210
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

1608
00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.670
<v Speaker 4>And so they tried to to fight it in court.</v>

1609
00:48:49.671 --> 00:48:52.520
<v Speaker 4>And like three years later the judge said,</v>

1610
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:52.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1611
00:48:52.761 --> 00:48:53.220
<v Speaker 4>like as if the,</v>

1612
00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:57.800
<v Speaker 4>if the judge had said on the grounds of it's improper usage or it's a safety</v>

1613
00:48:57.801 --> 00:48:59.120
<v Speaker 4>threat or it's like,</v>

1614
00:48:59.121 --> 00:48:59.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1615
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.710
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1616
00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:02.510
<v Speaker 4>there was a way that they could have legitimately said there's no dancing.</v>

1617
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.840
<v Speaker 4>But it's kind of a ridiculous thing to say anywhere that you're legally allowed</v>

1618
00:49:05.841 --> 00:49:06.674
<v Speaker 4>to be.</v>

1619
00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.260
<v Speaker 4>You don't have control over your body.</v>

1620
00:49:09.261 --> 00:49:10.410
<v Speaker 4>Or if you move in a certain way,</v>

1621
00:49:10.411 --> 00:49:11.840
<v Speaker 4>like that's going to be illegal,</v>

1622
00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:12.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1623
00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:13.460
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>

1624
00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:15.200
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of absurd on its premise,</v>

1625
00:49:15.201 --> 00:49:16.400
<v Speaker 4>like most of the things of,</v>

1626
00:49:16.401 --> 00:49:16.660
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1627
00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:20.930
<v Speaker 4>of government when you really go down to the actual core premise of what it</v>

1628
00:49:20.931 --> 00:49:21.764
<v Speaker 4>means to be,</v>

1629
00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:22.080
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1630
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:22.221
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1631
00:49:22.221 --> 00:49:22.490
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1632
00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:25.550
<v Speaker 4>when you say there should be a law for this or it should be illegal for that,</v>

1633
00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:27.020
<v Speaker 4>but we,</v>

1634
00:49:27.021 --> 00:49:27.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1635
00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:32.290
<v Speaker 4>we decided to go back because the judge said it was not appropriately reverent</v>

1636
00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:33.403
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>

1637
00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:34.250
<v Speaker 4>Reverent,</v>

1638
00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:35.083
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

1639
00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:37.490
<v Speaker 4>You had to be reverent of Thomas Jefferson.</v>

1640
00:49:37.491 --> 00:49:42.170
<v Speaker 4>This is a public memorial where you've got kids spilling drinks and playing with</v>

1641
00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:46.130
<v Speaker 4>toys and cars and shit like all over the place and you can't dance.</v>

1642
00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:47.053
<v Speaker 4>What's the video?</v>

1643
00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:52.900
<v Speaker 4>If you go to youtube.com/Adam kochish and then search for most viewed</v>

1644
00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:59.570
<v Speaker 4>a high vitamin K o k e s h o k what was it?</v>

1645
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:01.790
<v Speaker 4>K O k e s h,</v>

1646
00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.310
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

1647
00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:03.440
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of a long video.</v>

1648
00:50:03.441 --> 00:50:04.041
<v Speaker 4>It's 10 minutes.</v>

1649
00:50:04.041 --> 00:50:07.730
<v Speaker 4>But so we went back and we know,</v>

1650
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:10.640
<v Speaker 4>we decided we're going to start dancing and the cops were waiting for us.</v>

1651
00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:13.100
<v Speaker 4>So they said who's in charge here?</v>

1652
00:50:13.101 --> 00:50:14.840
<v Speaker 4>And we all pointed to Thomas Jefferson,</v>

1653
00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:15.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1654
00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:20.920
<v Speaker 4>the giant 30 foot statue of him and this couple that was there just started</v>

1655
00:50:22.131 --> 00:50:27.131
<v Speaker 4>dancing and they bumped into one of the cops and the cop was like pointing his</v>

1656
00:50:27.351 --> 00:50:27.730
<v Speaker 4>goons.</v>

1657
00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:28.670
<v Speaker 4>You go go,</v>

1658
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:29.533
<v Speaker 4>go arrest them.</v>

1659
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:34.100
<v Speaker 4>And they're swaying like hugging like Dan the barely dancing.</v>

1660
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:35.840
<v Speaker 4>And so the rest of us were like,</v>

1661
00:50:35.841 --> 00:50:36.411
<v Speaker 4>well fuck that.</v>

1662
00:50:36.411 --> 00:50:37.244
<v Speaker 4>It's on.</v>

1663
00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:42.310
<v Speaker 4>And I was listening to what you can do it by ice cube and you could barely call</v>

1664
00:50:43.101 --> 00:50:44.150
<v Speaker 4>what I was doing dancing.</v>

1665
00:50:44.151 --> 00:50:45.650
<v Speaker 4>But by the end of this they,</v>

1666
00:50:45.651 --> 00:50:46.461
<v Speaker 4>they picked me,</v>

1667
00:50:46.461 --> 00:50:50.390
<v Speaker 4>the cop like picked me up and body slammed me because I was resisting with my</v>

1668
00:50:50.391 --> 00:50:52.310
<v Speaker 4>hands out like this at my hands out in front of me.</v>

1669
00:50:52.311 --> 00:50:52.431
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1670
00:50:52.431 --> 00:50:52.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1671
00:50:52.581 --> 00:50:52.881
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

1672
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:53.714
<v Speaker 4>I'm not violent.</v>

1673
00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:57.770
<v Speaker 4>And he picked me up and body slammed me and then kneed me in the ribs and choked</v>

1674
00:50:57.771 --> 00:50:59.030
<v Speaker 4>me on the ground there.</v>

1675
00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:01.070
<v Speaker 4>And the crazy part is,</v>

1676
00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:01.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1677
00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:02.480
<v Speaker 4>I was in the marines,</v>

1678
00:51:02.481 --> 00:51:02.751
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

1679
00:51:02.751 --> 00:51:04.310
<v Speaker 4>I was in the Marine Corps rugby team.</v>

1680
00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:06.740
<v Speaker 4>We trained for MMA right now.</v>

1681
00:51:06.741 --> 00:51:07.940
<v Speaker 4>But if I'm,</v>

1682
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:09.650
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know how to fall,</v>

1683
00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:10.430
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>

1684
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:12.020
<v Speaker 4>W I would have fractured my skull,</v>

1685
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:16.370
<v Speaker 4>like if I had gone limp and flipped bags on a marble floor and I would have</v>

1686
00:51:16.371 --> 00:51:17.360
<v Speaker 4>cracked my skull open,</v>

1687
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:18.920
<v Speaker 4>but you could have done,</v>

1688
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.601
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1689
00:51:19.601 --> 00:51:19.800
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1690
00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:20.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1691
00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.330
<v Speaker 4>ask around and I was okay.</v>

1692
00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:23.230
<v Speaker 4>We did.</v>

1693
00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:24.770
<v Speaker 4>It's the top in the middle there.</v>

1694
00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:32.290
<v Speaker 6>You can watch the whole thing unfold.</v>

1695
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:35.380
<v Speaker 6>Somebody that's leading</v>

1696
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:40.540
<v Speaker 6>this guy body slammed you.</v>

1697
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:41.000
<v Speaker 6>This is the.</v>

1698
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:41.833
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1699
00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:42.480
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's this,</v>

1700
00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.110
<v Speaker 6>it's this little chubby guy with,</v>

1701
00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.300
<v Speaker 6>with probably a really small penis,</v>

1702
00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:48.770
<v Speaker 6>but that's,</v>

1703
00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:52.120
<v Speaker 6>that's the people that are authorized to use violence by government.</v>

1704
00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.600
<v Speaker 6>That's got a sweet bike helmet.</v>

1705
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:04.880
<v Speaker 6>So he comes up and he's threatening to arrest us without telling us that there's</v>

1706
00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:06.740
<v Speaker 6>any law that we would be violating the</v>

1707
00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:11.900
<v Speaker 6>city to allow citation</v>

1708
00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.220
<v Speaker 6>and he just avoids the question.</v>

1709
00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.880
<v Speaker 6>You'll find out what,</v>

1710
00:52:20.881 --> 00:52:22.110
<v Speaker 6>what am I being arrested for?</v>

1711
00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:23.750
<v Speaker 6>You'll find out he's incompetent.</v>

1712
00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:29.733
<v Speaker 6>Then</v>

1713
00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.550
<v Speaker 6>we tried to get a legal definition of dancing.</v>

1714
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:39.550
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1715
00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:42.680
<v Speaker 6>What if you're at a time when you making movements with your body still dancing?</v>

1716
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:44.323
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1717
00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:47.510
<v Speaker 6>So now he calls over his gun and he's</v>

1718
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:51.380
<v Speaker 6>look at the little finger poke,</v>

1719
00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.240
<v Speaker 6>come on,</v>

1720
00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.330
<v Speaker 6>stop dancing.</v>

1721
00:52:57.490 --> 00:52:58.480
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>

1722
00:52:58.481 --> 00:52:59.380
<v Speaker 6>this is crazy.</v>

1723
00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:01.720
<v Speaker 6>This is nothing man.</v>

1724
00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:02.110
<v Speaker 6>This is,</v>

1725
00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:03.520
<v Speaker 6>this is just the beginning of this.</v>

1726
00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.073
<v Speaker 6>Give me a warning.</v>

1727
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:09.640
<v Speaker 6>And these cops are arresting her for dancing,</v>

1728
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:11.020
<v Speaker 6>for standing in slang.</v>

1729
00:53:11.021 --> 00:53:11.141
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1730
00:53:11.141 --> 00:53:12.400
<v Speaker 6>it's funny because this happened in New York,</v>

1731
00:53:12.401 --> 00:53:14.470
<v Speaker 6>so there's me sort of dancing.</v>

1732
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:21.760
<v Speaker 6>This is crazy.</v>

1733
00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:26.670
<v Speaker 6>So this is what we do now.</v>

1734
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:30.090
<v Speaker 6>Regular civil disobedience where we just risked,</v>

1735
00:53:30.091 --> 00:53:32.940
<v Speaker 6>arrest and stand up to the bully that has government.</v>

1736
00:53:32.941 --> 00:53:33.151
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1737
00:53:33.151 --> 00:53:35.790
<v Speaker 6>we had the curse in Middleborough Massachusetts last week.</v>

1738
00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:36.571
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1739
00:53:36.571 --> 00:53:37.570
<v Speaker 6>This is crazy.</v>

1740
00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:39.120
<v Speaker 6>They made it illegal to curse.</v>

1741
00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:39.961
<v Speaker 6>Did you hear that story?</v>

1742
00:53:39.961 --> 00:53:40.591
<v Speaker 6>I was in Middleborough,</v>

1743
00:53:40.591 --> 00:53:42.690
<v Speaker 6>Massachusetts back and had a protest.</v>

1744
00:53:42.691 --> 00:53:43.020
<v Speaker 6>Instead.</v>

1745
00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.420
<v Speaker 6>We're just free fucking speech demonstration</v>

1746
00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:50.890
<v Speaker 6>so it wouldn't be complete with little stare down with the cops there.</v>

1747
00:53:50.891 --> 00:53:53.260
<v Speaker 6>And I really didn't think I was going to go out and get arrested late actually.</v>

1748
00:53:53.261 --> 00:53:55.090
<v Speaker 6>I thought saying what does this dude saying?</v>

1749
00:53:55.091 --> 00:53:55.901
<v Speaker 6>You hate America.</v>

1750
00:53:55.901 --> 00:53:56.681
<v Speaker 6>You hate freedom.</v>

1751
00:53:56.681 --> 00:53:57.640
<v Speaker 6>We've seen that to the cop.</v>

1752
00:53:57.730 --> 00:53:58.563
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

1753
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:02.110
<v Speaker 6>So this is where it starts to get ugly.</v>

1754
00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:16.960
<v Speaker 6>So he's like reaching out and</v>

1755
00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:19.570
<v Speaker 6>punching him in the chest.</v>

1756
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.940
<v Speaker 6>This is America,</v>

1757
00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:25.200
<v Speaker 6>the public.</v>

1758
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:31.000
<v Speaker 6>So this is the crazy part here.</v>

1759
00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:46.180
<v Speaker 6>See there,</v>

1760
00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:50.290
<v Speaker 6>he needs me in the ribs and you see it go in like resisting arrest.</v>

1761
00:54:50.291 --> 00:54:51.520
<v Speaker 6>Still resisting arrest.</v>

1762
00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:55.300
<v Speaker 6>I mean even though it is as stupid as it is of what the charge is,</v>

1763
00:54:55.301 --> 00:54:57.730
<v Speaker 6>and then I mean when a police officers.</v>

1764
00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.400
<v Speaker 6>But that's the point is to show the violence of it.</v>

1765
00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.051
<v Speaker 6>There's no,</v>

1766
00:55:02.051 --> 00:55:03.580
<v Speaker 6>there's no justification for that.</v>

1767
00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:04.660
<v Speaker 6>The whole thing is ridiculous.</v>

1768
00:55:04.661 --> 00:55:05.290
<v Speaker 6>Let's cops.</v>

1769
00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:08.280
<v Speaker 6>They wanted to maintain this bullshit.</v>

1770
00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:09.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1771
00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:09.940
<v Speaker 6>Bullshit.</v>

1772
00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:12.610
<v Speaker 6>Sense of control and authority and they didn't recognize something that was</v>

1773
00:55:12.611 --> 00:55:13.610
<v Speaker 6>absolutely not a threat.</v>

1774
00:55:13.611 --> 00:55:14.920
<v Speaker 6>Just a bunch of peaceful people.</v>

1775
00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:15.231
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1776
00:55:15.231 --> 00:55:18.640
<v Speaker 6>they're hugging and you got to arrest him for hugging and moving their bodies.</v>

1777
00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:19.061
<v Speaker 6>That's.</v>

1778
00:55:19.061 --> 00:55:19.630
<v Speaker 6>There's no,</v>

1779
00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:21.340
<v Speaker 6>there's no justification for this.</v>

1780
00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:22.510
<v Speaker 6>This is nonsense.</v>

1781
00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:26.590
<v Speaker 6>You guys weren't causing problems or hassling people mean.</v>

1782
00:55:26.591 --> 00:55:28.390
<v Speaker 6>If you look into the context of this video,</v>

1783
00:55:28.391 --> 00:55:29.224
<v Speaker 6>this is insane.</v>

1784
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:31.850
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how these guys cannot.</v>

1785
00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:35.913
<v Speaker 6>You cannot.</v>

1786
00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:38.470
<v Speaker 6>You cannot stop them from dancing.</v>

1787
00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:40.450
<v Speaker 6>You cannot stop them from kissing.</v>

1788
00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:42.230
<v Speaker 6>You cannot stop doing.</v>

1789
00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:45.590
<v Speaker 6>Then they kicked the media out,</v>

1790
00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:51.180
<v Speaker 6>like how perfect is this as as a microcosm of what government.</v>

1791
00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:52.550
<v Speaker 6>Who's got this camera?</v>

1792
00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:53.540
<v Speaker 6>Who's filming this?</v>

1793
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.010
<v Speaker 6>This is actually dustin.</v>

1794
00:55:55.011 --> 00:55:56.720
<v Speaker 6>Actually the guy in the room right now.</v>

1795
00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:59.120
<v Speaker 6>This was when I had my tv show in DC.</v>

1796
00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:01.980
<v Speaker 6>What is he filming this with?</v>

1797
00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.291
<v Speaker 6>Dustin,</v>

1798
00:56:03.291 --> 00:56:04.130
<v Speaker 6>you want to step in here?</v>

1799
00:56:04.131 --> 00:56:04.964
<v Speaker 6>What are we filming?</v>

1800
00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:09.993
<v Speaker 6>I can't hear you.</v>

1801
00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:12.141
<v Speaker 6>Just a little camera.</v>

1802
00:56:12.141 --> 00:56:14.150
<v Speaker 6>I think he said it's a small handheld camera.</v>

1803
00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:16.100
<v Speaker 6>Was a canon from back.</v>

1804
00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.690
<v Speaker 6>Nobody told you to stop filming.</v>

1805
00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:21.050
<v Speaker 6>It was funny because they kick out the mainstream guy before they see me.</v>

1806
00:56:21.051 --> 00:56:22.670
<v Speaker 6>I was kind of just dancing along,</v>

1807
00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:24.110
<v Speaker 6>come and moving the laser,</v>

1808
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:27.220
<v Speaker 5>so there's a couple other guys that were filming this as well to get kicked out.</v>

1809
00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:30.820
<v Speaker 5>What's really ironic is they kicked out.</v>

1810
00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.100
<v Speaker 5>Well it doesn't say they kicked out the guy from Fox.</v>

1811
00:56:33.101 --> 00:56:34.240
<v Speaker 5>There's a local Fox network,</v>

1812
00:56:34.241 --> 00:56:36.610
<v Speaker 5>I think that was covering it that day and they kicked him out.</v>

1813
00:56:36.611 --> 00:56:38.590
<v Speaker 5>They kick out the guy with the big camera and then Dustin,</v>

1814
00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.433
<v Speaker 5>because you know he's.</v>

1815
00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:40.350
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1816
00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:41.830
<v Speaker 5>We were shoestring television.</v>

1817
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:42.131
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

1818
00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:44.740
<v Speaker 5>That right there was just idiots with power.</v>

1819
00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:45.221
<v Speaker 5>That's all.</v>

1820
00:56:45.221 --> 00:56:46.054
<v Speaker 5>That was.</v>

1821
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:47.680
<v Speaker 5>Incompetent fools.</v>

1822
00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:49.660
<v Speaker 5>That's a foolish person.</v>

1823
00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:53.350
<v Speaker 5>It isn't that a fun way to wake people up to to show people that he's a pussy.</v>

1824
00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:55.090
<v Speaker 5>This is what I always say about any,</v>

1825
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:55.781
<v Speaker 5>any laws,</v>

1826
00:56:55.781 --> 00:56:56.860
<v Speaker 5>any people getting arrested.</v>

1827
00:56:56.861 --> 00:56:58.900
<v Speaker 5>I use what I call the clinics would method.</v>

1828
00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:02.770
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine clinics would in a movie holding a gun,</v>

1829
00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.120
<v Speaker 5>arresting someone for that?</v>

1830
00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.230
<v Speaker 5>If not,</v>

1831
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:09.220
<v Speaker 5>then it's a stupid law because if you're not stealing or hurting someone or</v>

1832
00:57:09.221 --> 00:57:10.840
<v Speaker 5>robbing someone within.</v>

1833
00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:11.690
<v Speaker 5>What's the smart law?</v>

1834
00:57:11.691 --> 00:57:12.100
<v Speaker 5>Joe?</v>

1835
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:14.520
<v Speaker 5>A smart law is something that's set in place.</v>

1836
00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:17.170
<v Speaker 5>People don't fuck five-year-olds.</v>

1837
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:20.020
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that should be a law.</v>

1838
00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:25.360
<v Speaker 5>Maybe the earlier that we should have or are the ones that are based on on</v>

1839
00:57:25.361 --> 00:57:27.880
<v Speaker 5>respecting each other instead of having a central authority,</v>

1840
00:57:27.881 --> 00:57:31.030
<v Speaker 5>deciding what what even the standards of society are going to be.</v>

1841
00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:34.300
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that with the Internet and what's happening now with the</v>

1842
00:57:34.301 --> 00:57:39.301
<v Speaker 5>integration of society and technology that we're sort of slowly but surely</v>

1843
00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:42.130
<v Speaker 5>getting closer to each other,</v>

1844
00:57:42.131 --> 00:57:44.950
<v Speaker 5>even that it's comfortable and it's going to get to a certain point in time</v>

1845
00:57:44.951 --> 00:57:47.170
<v Speaker 5>where there's not going to be a whole lot of privacy in this world?</v>

1846
00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:47.591
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1847
00:57:47.591 --> 00:57:47.790
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1848
00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:49.960
<v Speaker 5>but I think maybe that'll be.</v>

1849
00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:50.711
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1850
00:57:50.711 --> 00:57:53.380
<v Speaker 5>it's scary for us because we value privacy,</v>

1851
00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.600
<v Speaker 5>but it might ultimately be for the best.</v>

1852
00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:56.710
<v Speaker 5>I think it's always for the best.</v>

1853
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:58.660
<v Speaker 5>I have faith in technology because it's empowering,</v>

1854
00:57:58.661 --> 00:58:01.630
<v Speaker 5>but it's kind of scary right now to see that it's empowering to itself.</v>

1855
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:03.850
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying doesn't have a moral idea.</v>

1856
00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:08.430
<v Speaker 5>We have this idea that it's only for good until ai comes live when when</v>

1857
00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:10.670
<v Speaker 5>artificial intelligence actually becomes sent.</v>

1858
00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:10.931
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1859
00:58:10.931 --> 00:58:11.764
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of.</v>

1860
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:13.600
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of scientists,</v>

1861
00:58:13.601 --> 00:58:16.390
<v Speaker 5>very intelligent people that have studied this shit their whole life.</v>

1862
00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:17.950
<v Speaker 5>That guy in that movie,</v>

1863
00:58:17.951 --> 00:58:21.190
<v Speaker 5>the singularity movie was Kurzweil's documentary.</v>

1864
00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.070
<v Speaker 5>Was it called transcendent?</v>

1865
00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:25.323
<v Speaker 5>Transcendent man.</v>

1866
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:29.290
<v Speaker 5>There's a guy in England is terrified of what he calls artilects artificial</v>

1867
00:58:29.291 --> 00:58:29.950
<v Speaker 5>intellects.</v>

1868
00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:33.430
<v Speaker 5>He's terrified of the possibility of them actually getting to a point</v>

1869
00:58:33.431 --> 00:58:37.240
<v Speaker 5>technologically where they can think for themselves and shut things off and</v>

1870
00:58:37.241 --> 00:58:39.940
<v Speaker 5>create new ones and create new artificial intelligence.</v>

1871
00:58:39.941 --> 00:58:42.880
<v Speaker 5>It's more powerful and with more potential than they have,</v>

1872
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.230
<v Speaker 5>but this is all real.</v>

1873
00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:44.861
<v Speaker 5>Very,</v>

1874
00:58:44.861 --> 00:58:45.730
<v Speaker 5>very possible.</v>

1875
00:58:45.731 --> 00:58:48.930
<v Speaker 5>You can't say no like this is 100 percent possible.</v>

1876
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:49.561
<v Speaker 5>It's scary.</v>

1877
00:58:49.561 --> 00:58:49.690
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1878
00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:50.110
<v Speaker 5>it's no.</v>

1879
00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:50.380
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

1880
00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:52.040
<v Speaker 5>So technology is available.</v>

1881
00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:52.571
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1882
00:58:52.571 --> 00:58:55.240
<v Speaker 5>but it's not always good for this.</v>

1883
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.571
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1884
00:58:55.571 --> 00:58:56.404
<v Speaker 5>it's good.</v>

1885
00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:57.880
<v Speaker 5>It is what the universe is,</v>

1886
00:58:57.881 --> 00:58:59.410
<v Speaker 5>which is ever complex.</v>

1887
00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:04.120
<v Speaker 5>Just complexification on top of complexification keeps moving in that direction.</v>

1888
00:59:04.121 --> 00:59:04.960
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't stop,</v>

1889
00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:05.561
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1890
00:59:05.561 --> 00:59:08.560
<v Speaker 5>stars explode and they eventually become fucking human beings.</v>

1891
00:59:08.561 --> 00:59:08.801
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1892
00:59:08.801 --> 00:59:12.790
<v Speaker 5>all of this is coming from this idea that things get more and more complex and</v>

1893
00:59:12.791 --> 00:59:13.660
<v Speaker 5>more and more crazy,</v>

1894
00:59:13.661 --> 00:59:16.420
<v Speaker 5>but might not necessarily be good for humans.</v>

1895
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.670
<v Speaker 5>Technology might be terrible for humans.</v>

1896
00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:21.950
<v Speaker 5>We might just be the rats that build the raft.</v>

1897
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.060
<v Speaker 5>Well might just be the monkeys that start the computer life form.</v>

1898
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:30.470
<v Speaker 5>They start the artificial ones and zero life on and we say it's not real,</v>

1899
00:59:30.471 --> 00:59:32.990
<v Speaker 5>but it becomes real when you make it real.</v>

1900
00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:37.610
<v Speaker 5>If artificial intelligence actually becomes sentience than it is real.</v>

1901
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:42.230
<v Speaker 5>That's a real life form and we just don't think of it and respect it like,</v>

1902
00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:42.550
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1903
00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:46.640
<v Speaker 5>like we would in alien life form because we think of it as something that we</v>

1904
00:59:46.641 --> 00:59:48.590
<v Speaker 5>have control over because we just shut the power off.</v>

1905
00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:50.510
<v Speaker 5>We just turn the switches on for now.</v>

1906
00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:52.340
<v Speaker 5>That's all true at some point that goes away.</v>

1907
00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:52.791
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

1908
00:59:52.791 --> 00:59:56.960
<v Speaker 5>if you give that the computer program that you create the initiative to act on</v>

1909
00:59:56.961 --> 01:00:01.430
<v Speaker 5>its own and it's much more intelligent than you are that things might get crazy.</v>

1910
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:01.791
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

1911
01:00:01.791 --> 01:00:02.810
<v Speaker 5>they are going to get crazy,</v>

1912
01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:03.650
<v Speaker 5>but that's not good.</v>

1913
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:04.670
<v Speaker 5>It's not good for us.</v>

1914
01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:05.121
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1915
01:00:05.121 --> 01:00:08.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's going to be good for all the dumb fucks that.</v>

1916
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:08.421
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1917
01:00:08.421 --> 01:00:11.300
<v Speaker 5>but then you're like the person with the rotary telephone saying,</v>

1918
01:00:11.301 --> 01:00:11.511
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1919
01:00:11.511 --> 01:00:12.410
<v Speaker 5>those cell phones,</v>

1920
01:00:12.411 --> 01:00:13.220
<v Speaker 5>they're crazy.</v>

1921
01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:14.300
<v Speaker 5>They're bad for you.</v>

1922
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:14.691
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1923
01:00:14.691 --> 01:00:14.961
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1924
01:00:14.961 --> 01:00:15.794
<v Speaker 5>to a certain extent.</v>

1925
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:16.180
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1926
01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.570
<v Speaker 5>if you talk to people that live in the mountains,</v>

1927
01:00:17.571 --> 01:00:18.800
<v Speaker 5>they still stand by that shit.</v>

1928
01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:23.270
<v Speaker 5>You're fucking yourself up with all those cell phone signals and you don't need</v>

1929
01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:24.830
<v Speaker 5>to check your email every five minutes,</v>

1930
01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:26.443
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1931
01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:31.010
<v Speaker 5>this when we might be is just a step along the way.</v>

1932
01:00:31.011 --> 01:00:31.191
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1933
01:00:31.191 --> 01:00:32.300
<v Speaker 5>me surely are right.</v>

1934
01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:32.811
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1935
01:00:32.811 --> 01:00:34.190
<v Speaker 5>we look at evolution.</v>

1936
01:00:34.191 --> 01:00:37.490
<v Speaker 5>We look at these new fossils they just discovered today where there was a,</v>

1937
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:40.850
<v Speaker 5>or it was just a news release today about,</v>

1938
01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:41.180
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1939
01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:42.013
<v Speaker 5>some,</v>

1940
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:47.600
<v Speaker 5>some hominoid that was a distant relative of ours that was upright and walking 6</v>

1941
01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.410
<v Speaker 5>million years ago.</v>

1942
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:49.700
<v Speaker 5>It was pretty radical discovery.</v>

1943
01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:50.540
<v Speaker 5>They're figuring this out.</v>

1944
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:51.703
<v Speaker 5>Just think of that.</v>

1945
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:54.260
<v Speaker 5>Six million years ago there was some fucking monkey thing,</v>

1946
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.820
<v Speaker 5>and then 6 million years later,</v>

1947
01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:56.470
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>

1948
01:00:56.470 --> 01:01:00.470
<v Speaker 5>unr sitting in front of giant laptops and ones and Zeros are flying around,</v>

1949
01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:01.420
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

1950
01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:04.220
<v Speaker 5>through these pipes and wires and shit under the ocean.</v>

1951
01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:05.190
<v Speaker 5>And whoa,</v>

1952
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.360
<v Speaker 5>it's getting fast.</v>

1953
01:01:06.361 --> 01:01:06.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1954
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.330
<v Speaker 5>It's always getting faster and faster and faster.</v>

1955
01:01:09.331 --> 01:01:10.530
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

1956
01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:12.740
<v Speaker 5>That's what tempts me to be scared,</v>

1957
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:13.690
<v Speaker 5>should be,</v>

1958
01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:15.890
<v Speaker 5>is that we're going to get to this point.</v>

1959
01:01:15.891 --> 01:01:19.110
<v Speaker 5>We're going to the technological singularity coming in what 20 years we,</v>

1960
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:22.550
<v Speaker 5>and this is the implication of that when we have a computer that's smarter than</v>

1961
01:01:22.551 --> 01:01:23.930
<v Speaker 5>the human brain and in a sense we've,</v>

1962
01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.510
<v Speaker 5>that's like an arbitrary benchmark,</v>

1963
01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:27.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1964
01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:28.490
<v Speaker 5>a more significant benchmark.</v>

1965
01:01:28.491 --> 01:01:31.190
<v Speaker 5>That in a way is not a benchmark because as soon as we have,</v>

1966
01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:31.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1967
01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:32.361
<v Speaker 5>the wheel,</v>

1968
01:01:32.361 --> 01:01:34.030
<v Speaker 5>we're able to use that to get rate,</v>

1969
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:35.270
<v Speaker 5>get more technology,</v>

1970
01:01:35.271 --> 01:01:35.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1971
01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:39.680
<v Speaker 5>every innovation builds on the previous innovations.</v>

1972
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:44.120
<v Speaker 5>But in a sense we get to the point where we have computers that we tell design</v>

1973
01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:45.680
<v Speaker 5>the next smarter computer design,</v>

1974
01:01:45.681 --> 01:01:50.660
<v Speaker 5>the next Margaret computer chip and we're already kind of at that point and then</v>

1975
01:01:50.661 --> 01:01:52.220
<v Speaker 5>it takes off this exponential curve.</v>

1976
01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:53.060
<v Speaker 5>Next thing you know,</v>

1977
01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:53.311
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

1978
01:01:53.311 --> 01:01:54.640
<v Speaker 5>we're telling computers how to solve,</v>

1979
01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.770
<v Speaker 5>instructing these things to solve and they're going to tell us gay shit</v>

1980
01:01:57.771 --> 01:01:58.041
<v Speaker 5>together,</v>

1981
01:01:58.041 --> 01:01:58.680
<v Speaker 5>bitch.</v>

1982
01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.330
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1983
01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:02.570
<v Speaker 5>what I'm scared of is that like right now we see in the news they have this</v>

1984
01:02:02.571 --> 01:02:07.190
<v Speaker 5>laser that can hit your scan and do a molecular analysis from 100 feet away and</v>

1985
01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.910
<v Speaker 5>the Tsa is going to have this and be able to tell what bowl breakfast that</v>

1986
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:11.150
<v Speaker 5>morning.</v>

1987
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.983
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy,</v>

1988
01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:15.020
<v Speaker 5>but it scares me to see that that's in the government's hands.</v>

1989
01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:16.460
<v Speaker 5>But at the same time I'm,</v>

1990
01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:17.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm so confident,</v>

1991
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.321
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1992
01:02:18.321 --> 01:02:19.154
<v Speaker 5>and like I said,</v>

1993
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:23.180
<v Speaker 5>is going to get scary and at some point every surface surrounding this is going</v>

1994
01:02:23.181 --> 01:02:27.300
<v Speaker 5>to be a touchscreen and you virtual reality merges with reality and then who</v>

1995
01:02:27.301 --> 01:02:27.541
<v Speaker 5>knows,</v>

1996
01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:30.840
<v Speaker 5>but now we're going to have to jump ahead and started talking about my last dmt</v>

1997
01:02:30.841 --> 01:02:33.690
<v Speaker 5>experience because it really relates to that.</v>

1998
01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.010
<v Speaker 5>But what we're,</v>

1999
01:02:35.011 --> 01:02:37.860
<v Speaker 5>what we're coming to is there's going to be a point where basically everybody</v>

2000
01:02:37.861 --> 01:02:38.970
<v Speaker 5>gets a therapy robot.</v>

2001
01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:39.804
<v Speaker 5>That's my prediction.</v>

2002
01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:40.621
<v Speaker 5>And in a way,</v>

2003
01:02:40.621 --> 01:02:42.000
<v Speaker 5>you know what I thought about this.</v>

2004
01:02:42.001 --> 01:02:44.820
<v Speaker 5>Every single trend that I look at like way into the future.</v>

2005
01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:45.390
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2006
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.691
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

2007
01:02:45.691 --> 01:02:46.171
<v Speaker 5>wait a second.</v>

2008
01:02:46.171 --> 01:02:47.190
<v Speaker 5>How is it already happening now?</v>

2009
01:02:47.191 --> 01:02:48.024
<v Speaker 5>And in a sense,</v>

2010
01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:51.270
<v Speaker 5>think about how much therapy and psychological benefit people get from the</v>

2011
01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:51.601
<v Speaker 5>Internet.</v>

2012
01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.070
<v Speaker 5>The fact that they can look shit up and go,</v>

2013
01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:53.950
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2014
01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:56.400
<v Speaker 5>I know I have issues because of this.</v>

2015
01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.470
<v Speaker 5>Or they're able to find communities,</v>

2016
01:02:58.471 --> 01:03:03.360
<v Speaker 5>people that work through their issues in a way it's able to develop issues more</v>

2017
01:03:03.361 --> 01:03:07.580
<v Speaker 5>likely than a KKK website.</v>

2018
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:11.910
<v Speaker 5>I fucking sleep with a laptop in my bed.</v>

2019
01:03:11.911 --> 01:03:15.990
<v Speaker 5>That's the percentage of what's being done on the Internet is not educational in</v>

2020
01:03:15.991 --> 01:03:16.741
<v Speaker 5>one way or another.</v>

2021
01:03:16.741 --> 01:03:17.001
<v Speaker 5>I mean the,</v>

2022
01:03:17.001 --> 01:03:17.120
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2023
01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.430
<v Speaker 5>the potential for education exists.</v>

2024
01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:23.220
<v Speaker 5>But compare what's happening majority station with the Internet compared to what</v>

2025
01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:24.063
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>

2026
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:26.100
<v Speaker 5>Everything's accelerating,</v>

2027
01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.290
<v Speaker 5>whether it's entertainment or education.</v>

2028
01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:29.160
<v Speaker 5>Kids are smarter today.</v>

2029
01:03:29.161 --> 01:03:30.840
<v Speaker 5>They have more access to information today,</v>

2030
01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:31.500
<v Speaker 5>less,</v>

2031
01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:34.560
<v Speaker 5>less viable to be sucked in by propaganda.</v>

2032
01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:35.040
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

2033
01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:35.331
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2034
01:03:35.331 --> 01:03:35.481
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2035
01:03:35.481 --> 01:03:36.690
<v Speaker 5>it's a different time.</v>

2036
01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.880
<v Speaker 5>We live in a time that's just is unprecedented.</v>

2037
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:39.540
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

2038
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.291
<v Speaker 5>we're in the,</v>

2039
01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:41.280
<v Speaker 5>we're in the wild west.</v>

2040
01:03:41.281 --> 01:03:43.200
<v Speaker 5>We're in the wild west of technology.</v>

2041
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:45.540
<v Speaker 5>Each time we look back in human history,</v>

2042
01:03:45.541 --> 01:03:46.710
<v Speaker 5>we're going to see this as the,</v>

2043
01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:49.260
<v Speaker 5>as the point at which we hit the vertical asymptote.</v>

2044
01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:51.330
<v Speaker 5>That's what the next 20,</v>

2045
01:03:51.331 --> 01:03:55.140
<v Speaker 5>30 years it's going to be that curve and the and the exponential growth curve.</v>

2046
01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:56.760
<v Speaker 5>That is the human experience.</v>

2047
01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:59.610
<v Speaker 5>I call it the roaring twenties of the technological age.</v>

2048
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:00.990
<v Speaker 5>That's what I take where we're at.</v>

2049
01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:04.260
<v Speaker 5>I think we're in the roaring twenties of the technological age because I think</v>

2050
01:04:04.261 --> 01:04:04.741
<v Speaker 5>they're right now.</v>

2051
01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:07.920
<v Speaker 5>We still don't really have a handle on what this fucking thinking that actually</v>

2052
01:04:07.921 --> 01:04:08.520
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

2053
01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:08.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2054
01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:09.140
<v Speaker 5>instilled.</v>

2055
01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:12.720
<v Speaker 5>There's all clunky things like windows run time errors and you know,</v>

2056
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:15.270
<v Speaker 5>hundreds of thousands of computer viruses and.</v>

2057
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:16.343
<v Speaker 5>But what's going,</v>

2058
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:21.420
<v Speaker 5>what's going on with Brian has to talk to the AC guy leaves.</v>

2059
01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad I dress for the warm weather.</v>

2060
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:27.361
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2061
01:04:27.361 --> 01:04:30.380
<v Speaker 5>We have some funky air conditioning issues here at the ice house,</v>

2062
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:31.290
<v Speaker 5>so we're trying to work out.</v>

2063
01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:34.050
<v Speaker 5>It's funny that you call it the ice house and it's hot as fuck in here.</v>

2064
01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.950
<v Speaker 5>I went through that bad joke routine in my head on the way over here today is</v>

2065
01:04:37.951 --> 01:04:39.030
<v Speaker 5>much better than yesterday though.</v>

2066
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:40.230
<v Speaker 5>Yesterday was pretty brutal.</v>

2067
01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:41.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how people do Vegas,</v>

2068
01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:42.130
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2069
01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:45.600
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I could do 120 degrees that you step outside.</v>

2070
01:04:45.601 --> 01:04:49.200
<v Speaker 5>It's like getting hit in the face with a hairdryer solution for seven months.</v>

2071
01:04:49.201 --> 01:04:49.500
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

2072
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.333
<v Speaker 5>What's that like?</v>

2073
01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:52.590
<v Speaker 5>You don't notice over 1:15,</v>

2074
01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:55.770
<v Speaker 5>you just sort of like real and it's the same way for like with me for weed,</v>

2075
01:04:55.771 --> 01:04:56.011
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2076
01:04:56.011 --> 01:04:58.080
<v Speaker 5>you get so high and they kind of Plateau.</v>

2077
01:04:58.300 --> 01:04:58.980
<v Speaker 5>It's like above,</v>

2078
01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:01.170
<v Speaker 5>above about 115 degrees Fahrenheit.</v>

2079
01:05:01.171 --> 01:05:03.630
<v Speaker 5>The human body and the desert can't really tell the difference.</v>

2080
01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:07.140
<v Speaker 5>There are times when you inhale fire,</v>

2081
01:05:07.141 --> 01:05:07.441
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2082
01:05:07.441 --> 01:05:08.430
<v Speaker 5>from a hot breeze.</v>

2083
01:05:08.431 --> 01:05:09.360
<v Speaker 5>But really it's just,</v>

2084
01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:10.673
<v Speaker 5>you're just hot.</v>

2085
01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:13.980
<v Speaker 5>Were you over there without Pat Tillman was killed.</v>

2086
01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:16.110
<v Speaker 5>He was in Afghanistan.</v>

2087
01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.220
<v Speaker 5>He was in Afghanistan.</v>

2088
01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:17.680
<v Speaker 5>But when I.</v>

2089
01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.540
<v Speaker 5>Did you hear the news when you were over there?</v>

2090
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.680
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2091
01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.160
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

2092
01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.330
<v Speaker 5>Because I remember that unfolding.</v>

2093
01:05:22.331 --> 01:05:23.500
<v Speaker 5>I was there in 2004.</v>

2094
01:05:23.501 --> 01:05:26.700
<v Speaker 5>You want me to look it up because I wasn't always remember what you felt like</v>

2095
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:27.740
<v Speaker 5>when you were heard.</v>

2096
01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:31.340
<v Speaker 5>Like all the shit that went down when they tried to say it was,</v>

2097
01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:34.140
<v Speaker 5>he was killed in action and it was really friendly back then.</v>

2098
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.370
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2099
01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:34.601
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2100
01:05:34.601 --> 01:05:35.434
<v Speaker 5>I was asleep,</v>

2101
01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:35.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2102
01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:36.190
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

2103
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:37.320
<v Speaker 5>I was one of the sheep.</v>

2104
01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:37.751
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

2105
01:05:37.751 --> 01:05:38.441
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't,</v>

2106
01:05:38.441 --> 01:05:39.250
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2107
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:40.750
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't politically attuned.</v>

2108
01:05:40.751 --> 01:05:42.490
<v Speaker 5>So when I heard the store and was like,</v>

2109
01:05:42.491 --> 01:05:43.360
<v Speaker 5>I acknowledged it,</v>

2110
01:05:43.361 --> 01:05:46.420
<v Speaker 5>but I wasn't really find that hard to believe you're very articulate guy.</v>

2111
01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:46.631
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2112
01:05:46.631 --> 01:05:47.464
<v Speaker 5>he can't,</v>

2113
01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:50.590
<v Speaker 5>even if you're obsessed with all this information,</v>

2114
01:05:50.591 --> 01:05:52.930
<v Speaker 5>there's no way that you would be a stupid person when you're young</v>

2115
01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:56.111
<v Speaker 5>to believe in it.</v>

2116
01:05:56.111 --> 01:05:56.380
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

2117
01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:57.213
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2118
01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:58.210
<v Speaker 5>you're susceptible.</v>

2119
01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:00.970
<v Speaker 5>We should step back and maybe for a minute and talk about this,</v>

2120
01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:01.451
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2121
01:06:01.451 --> 01:06:01.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>in a way I really look up to you and I feel like</v>

2129
01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.280
<v Speaker 5>as much as my audience wants you to benefit from hearing my perspective right</v>

2130
01:06:27.281 --> 01:06:31.070
<v Speaker 5>now and talk about what I'm,</v>

2131
01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:31.620
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

2132
01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:36.070
<v Speaker 5>what we refer to ourselves as awake to our understanding of government society,</v>

2133
01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:36.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2134
01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:37.383
<v Speaker 5>I want to,</v>

2135
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:38.263
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2136
01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:38.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2137
01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:38.900
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

2138
01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:40.240
<v Speaker 5>you're 14 years ahead of me,</v>

2139
01:06:40.241 --> 01:06:41.074
<v Speaker 5>but you're like,</v>

2140
01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:41.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2141
01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:41.901
<v Speaker 5>I want,</v>

2142
01:06:41.901 --> 01:06:42.590
<v Speaker 5>I want to,</v>

2143
01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:45.070
<v Speaker 5>I want to learn something from you almost want to be interviewing you.</v>

2144
01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:48.130
<v Speaker 5>But I think we all were learning from each other.</v>

2145
01:06:48.131 --> 01:06:48.371
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2146
01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:49.620
<v Speaker 5>you saying that you look up to me is,</v>

2147
01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:54.640
<v Speaker 5>it's always funny to me when people say things like that because I think the</v>

2148
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:59.860
<v Speaker 5>reality of it is we all inspire each other and it's great when we run into</v>

2149
01:06:59.861 --> 01:07:02.530
<v Speaker 5>someone who we really feel like is on the right path.</v>

2150
01:07:02.531 --> 01:07:02.771
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2151

01:07:03.431 --> 01:07:04.630
<v Speaker 5>you're out there doing it,</v>

2153
01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:05.231
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2154
01:07:05.231 --> 01:07:07.660
<v Speaker 5>and we benefit from each other.</v>

2155
01:07:07.661 --> 01:07:08.141
<v Speaker 5>All of us.</v>

2156
01:07:08.141 --> 01:07:08.500
<v Speaker 5>Do,</v>

2157
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:09.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2158
01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:09.873
<v Speaker 5>that's just,</v>

2159
01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:11.013
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

2160
01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:13.030
<v Speaker 5>that's the good thing about the internet.</v>

2161
01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.330
<v Speaker 5>That's a great thing about the end of the Internet connect people like you and I</v>

2162
01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.820
<v Speaker 5>were in past years.</v>

2163
01:07:18.821 --> 01:07:20.350
<v Speaker 5>It would be so impossible.</v>

2164
01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.930
<v Speaker 5>This is that we exchanged a couple series of tweets.</v>

2165
01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.880
<v Speaker 5>We don't even talk to each other face to face too.</v>

2166
01:07:24.881 --> 01:07:25.780
<v Speaker 5>We're actually saying no,</v>

2167
01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:26.801
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's a,</v>

2168
01:07:26.801 --> 01:07:27.634
<v Speaker 5>that's a crazy,</v>

2169
01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:28.690
<v Speaker 5>crazy world.</v>

2170
01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:32.500
<v Speaker 5>So in that sense it does amazing things,</v>

2171
01:07:32.501 --> 01:07:34.420
<v Speaker 5>but we were all.</v>

2172
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:36.760
<v Speaker 5>Everybody has a part in this thing is one of the things I was going to say</v>

2173
01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:37.511
<v Speaker 5>earlier when you were,</v>

2174
01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:38.344
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2175
01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:38.860
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

2176
01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:42.460
<v Speaker 5>when you were talking about people and the human mind and the power of a</v>

2177
01:07:42.461 --> 01:07:43.270
<v Speaker 5>computer,</v>

2178
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:47.710
<v Speaker 5>the crazy thing about people is not just the power of the human mind is the fact</v>

2179
01:07:47.711 --> 01:07:51.550
<v Speaker 5>that we can figure out how to work together because the only way a computer gets</v>

2180
01:07:51.551 --> 01:07:55.540
<v Speaker 5>made is if somebody figures out how to make all the different parts of it and</v>

2181
01:07:55.541 --> 01:07:58.450
<v Speaker 5>figure out how to integrate them together and make it work together.</v>

2182
01:07:58.720 --> 01:07:59.380
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot.</v>

2183
01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:00.630
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot of motherfuckers.</v>

2184
01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:05.170
<v Speaker 5>That's not one dude figuring out how to Code Algorithms and figuring out how to</v>

2185
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.670
<v Speaker 5>send packets or the Internet.</v>

2186
01:08:06.671 --> 01:08:06.821
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2187
01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:08.500
<v Speaker 5>this is like a bunch of people.</v>

2188
01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:13.240
<v Speaker 5>Everyone has a specific task and guys like you have a task,</v>

2189
01:08:13.310 --> 01:08:14.830
<v Speaker 5>guys like me have a task.</v>

2190
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.960
<v Speaker 5>We all have that</v>

2191
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:17.560
<v Speaker 2>task is what?</v>

2192
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:18.980
<v Speaker 2>What are you drawn towards?</v>

2193
01:08:18.981 --> 01:08:21.080
<v Speaker 2>And even if it's fucking playing basketball,</v>

2194
01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:22.550
<v Speaker 2>if that's what you love to do,</v>

2195
01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.490
<v Speaker 2>and if you're fucking thinking about basketball all the time,</v>

2196
01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:26.090
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2197
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.781
<v Speaker 2>that's your thing,</v>

2198
01:08:26.781 --> 01:08:27.170
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2199
01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:27.741
<v Speaker 2>That's not a,</v>

2200
01:08:27.741 --> 01:08:28.910
<v Speaker 2>it's not a bad thing.</v>

2201
01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:31.240
<v Speaker 2>Standup comedy is a ridiculous pursuit.</v>

2202
01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:32.130
<v Speaker 2>You just making people laugh.</v>

2203
01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:33.140
<v Speaker 2>That's not still,</v>

2204
01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:34.220
<v Speaker 2>it's not a bad thing.</v>

2205
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:37.730
<v Speaker 2>You in lane people and your comedy sets you apart.</v>

2206
01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:39.320
<v Speaker 2>It's not enlightened.</v>

2207
01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:39.621
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2208
01:08:39.621 --> 01:08:44.621
<v Speaker 2>I tell them shit that I heard you share a very valuable and empowering</v>

2209
01:08:45.051 --> 01:08:45.884
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

2210
01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.033
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2211
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:50.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy that that's the case for me.</v>

2212
01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:50.231
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2213
01:08:50.231 --> 01:08:50.451
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2214
01:08:50.451 --> 01:08:52.760
<v Speaker 2>that that's true and I appreciate it.</v>

2215
01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:53.301
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that.</v>

2216
01:08:53.301 --> 01:08:55.820
<v Speaker 2>That's the case for your masturbation jokes,</v>

2217
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:56.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2218
01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:56.940
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2219
01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:57.220
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2220
01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:01.580
<v Speaker 2>in today's repressed age are empowering the people that are afraid to talk about</v>

2221
01:09:01.581 --> 01:09:02.150
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>

2222
01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:02.421
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2223
01:09:02.421 --> 01:09:03.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

2224
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:04.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2225
01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:04.420
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2226
01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:08.960
<v Speaker 2>the lessons and the battles that you go through in your life where you figure</v>

2227
01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.000
<v Speaker 2>out what stupid and what's empowering,</v>

2228
01:09:11.001 --> 01:09:16.001
<v Speaker 2>what's good and what's bad for you not to have a perspective when you get to be</v>

2229
01:09:16.671 --> 01:09:17.360
<v Speaker 2>a certain age.</v>

2230
01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:21.350
<v Speaker 2>We hit 44 years old and not have some shit figured out that you didn't have when</v>

2231
01:09:21.351 --> 01:09:21.861
<v Speaker 2>you were 25.</v>

2232
01:09:21.861 --> 01:09:22.700
<v Speaker 2>This is ridiculous.</v>

2233
01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.030
<v Speaker 2>But from,</v>

2234
01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:24.741
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

2235
01:09:24.741 --> 01:09:28.510
<v Speaker 2>it's like when whenever someone would say they look up to me or you know,</v>

2236
01:09:28.511 --> 01:09:28.851
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2237
01:09:28.851 --> 01:09:29.684
<v Speaker 2>you changed my life.</v>

2238
01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.670
<v Speaker 2>I would say like I'm not going to antenna.</v>

2239
01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:32.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2240
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm just antenna for all the shit that's out there in,</v>

2241
01:09:35.801 --> 01:09:38.090
<v Speaker 2>in this crazy fucking weird world.</v>

2242
01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:42.740
<v Speaker 2>So when I repeat shit back or when I analyze and add a bunch of shit together</v>

2243
01:09:42.741 --> 01:09:43.270
<v Speaker 2>that I've,</v>

2244
01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:44.900
<v Speaker 2>that I've read that other people have figured out,</v>

2245
01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:46.750
<v Speaker 2>someone saying they look up to that.</v>

2246
01:09:46.751 --> 01:09:49.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a very weird thing to hear because it's just,</v>

2247
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:51.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm just just dealing the stuff,</v>

2248
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:52.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2249
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:54.140
<v Speaker 2>just doing comedy or doing podcasts.</v>

2250
01:09:54.141 --> 01:09:54.974
<v Speaker 2>It's not a,</v>

2251
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:58.700
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't ever seem like a anything important,</v>

2252
01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:04.250
<v Speaker 2>but when you get the overwhelming amount of response that this podcast gets on</v>

2253
01:10:04.251 --> 01:10:05.860
<v Speaker 2>twitter and you know,</v>

2254
01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:06.950
<v Speaker 2>and whatever,</v>

2255
01:10:06.951 --> 01:10:07.641
<v Speaker 2>anything on the Internet,</v>

2256
01:10:07.641 --> 01:10:08.310
<v Speaker 2>my master port,</v>

2257
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:09.500
<v Speaker 2>it can fuck with your head.</v>

2258
01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:10.360
<v Speaker 2>It gets kinda tricky.</v>

2259
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:12.230
<v Speaker 2>You feel like you got this weird obligation,</v>

2260
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:14.350
<v Speaker 2>you know enough people come up to you and say,</v>

2261
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:15.710
<v Speaker 2>the Ama changed my life.</v>

2262
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:16.521

2271
01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:29.721

01:10:29.721 --> 01:10:30.554
<v Speaker 2>Nice down there.</v>

2273
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:32.330

2274
01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:33.173
<v Speaker 2>the weather's beautiful.</v>

2275
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:36.830
<v Speaker 2>The air conditioner outside is being worked on and should be done in like 30</v>

2276
01:10:36.831 --> 01:10:37.111
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

2277
01:10:37.111 --> 01:10:38.360
<v Speaker 2>So they're going to turn it off for 30 minutes.</v>

2278
01:10:38.361 --> 01:10:39.500
<v Speaker 2>But when I walked out I was like,</v>

2279
01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:40.490
<v Speaker 2>so how long is it going to take?</v>

2280
01:10:40.491 --> 01:10:41.360

2281
01:10:41.361 --> 01:10:42.050
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

2282
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.883

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.430
<v Speaker 2>He do.</v>

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Don't put that on the Internet.</v>

2287
01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.950
<v Speaker 2>That's the guy that's told them.</v>

2288
01:10:51.951 --> 01:10:54.500
<v Speaker 2>You're going to put that on the Internet please.</v>

2289
01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:55.161
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

2290
01:10:55.161 --> 01:10:57.020
<v Speaker 2>we should tell the federal federal rallies.</v>

2291
01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.130
<v Speaker 2>He is a licensed patient here in California.</v>

2292
01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:02.091
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of that,</v>

2293
01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:02.241
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

2294
01:11:02.241 --> 01:11:03.470
<v Speaker 2>That's a creepy thing.</v>

2295
01:11:03.471 --> 01:11:05.090
<v Speaker 2>When we had a Tommy Chong on,</v>

2296
01:11:05.091 --> 01:11:05.840
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about that.</v>

2297
01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.640
<v Speaker 2>We said it was basically a money grab.</v>

2298
01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:11.640
<v Speaker 2>These dea agents that are rating these California dispensary's even though in</v>

2299
01:11:11.641 --> 01:11:12.830
<v Speaker 2>the California state law,</v>

2300
01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:14.220
<v Speaker 2>medical marijuana is legal,</v>

2301
01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.090
<v Speaker 2>there are allowed to sell it.</v>

2302
01:11:15.091 --> 01:11:15.924
<v Speaker 2>They're allowed to have it.</v>

2303
01:11:15.970 --> 01:11:16.430
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

2304
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:17.360
<v Speaker 4>just for you,</v>

2305
01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:18.470
<v Speaker 4>just for you today.</v>

2306
01:11:18.471 --> 01:11:21.860
<v Speaker 4>I went and I got my license from Dr Winkler,</v>

2307
01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:22.490
<v Speaker 4>md.</v>

2308
01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:23.730
<v Speaker 4>Shouldn't say the doctor's name.</v>

2309
01:11:25.330 --> 01:11:26.840
<v Speaker 4>TheSe doctors are all undercover.</v>

2310
01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:27.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2311
01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:27.651
<v Speaker 4>he's cool.</v>

2312
01:11:27.651 --> 01:11:28.101
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

2313
01:11:28.101 --> 01:11:29.060
<v Speaker 4>It's all legit now.</v>

2314
01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:29.451
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

2315
01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:29.610
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2316
01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:30.111
<v Speaker 4>and I was.</v>

2317
01:11:30.111 --> 01:11:34.820
<v Speaker 4>I was afraid that what we were going to see was this and it is a ridiculous</v>

2318
01:11:34.821 --> 01:11:38.480
<v Speaker 4>cottage industry of writing medical marijuana prescription and I was thinking,</v>

2319
01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:39.051
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2320
01:11:39.051 --> 01:11:43.730
<v Speaker 4>it's a shame that this is a diversion of legitimate medical care resources and</v>

2321
01:11:43.731 --> 01:11:44.720
<v Speaker 4>to a certain extent it is,</v>

2322
01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:45.430
<v Speaker 4>but this is.</v>

2323
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:49.880
<v Speaker 4>He was the nicest old dude and when he came out of retirement to help patients</v>

2324
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:50.450
<v Speaker 4>all day,</v>

2325
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:51.230
<v Speaker 4>just chilling,</v>

2326
01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:51.441
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2327
01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:51.771
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2328
01:11:51.771 --> 01:11:54.320
<v Speaker 4>he does get to help patients occasionally as he says,</v>

2329
01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:54.771
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2330
01:11:54.771 --> 01:11:57.050
<v Speaker 4>because there's a lot of people that just come in for their paperwork,</v>

2331
01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:57.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2332
01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.730
<v Speaker 4>he's just writing scripts all day,</v>

2333
01:11:58.731 --> 01:11:59.061
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2334
01:11:59.061 --> 01:12:02.540
<v Speaker 4>it's karma and that man to be a doctor and do that.</v>

2335
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:03.220
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2336
01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:03.570
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2337
01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:04.640
<v Speaker 4>because you're turning the guns,</v>

2338
01:12:04.641 --> 01:12:06.590
<v Speaker 4>the government away from people you're covering for people.</v>

2339
01:12:06.591 --> 01:12:08.330
<v Speaker 4>And it's funny in Colorado though,</v>

2340
01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:10.290
<v Speaker 4>where it's not as well established.</v>

2341
01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:13.170
<v Speaker 4>So it hasn't been subjected to market forces for as long.</v>

2342
01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.230
<v Speaker 4>The doctor still charged $200,</v>

2343
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:19.730
<v Speaker 4>but my doctor charges more than the 35 minutes to write a referral.</v>

2344
01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:23.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't wanna I don't want to say my doctor's name because I don't want anybody</v>

2345
01:12:23.031 --> 01:12:25.660
<v Speaker 4>to get mad at them on the outside of the building.</v>

2346
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:28.520
<v Speaker 4>He went to jail for it.</v>

2347
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:29.810
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2348
01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:30.690
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>

2349
01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:33.060
<v Speaker 2>he did time and leave you.</v>

2350
01:12:33.061 --> 01:12:33.411
<v Speaker 2>I don't want,</v>

2351
01:12:33.411 --> 01:12:34.021
<v Speaker 2>if you went to jail for.</v>

2352
01:12:34.021 --> 01:12:34.854
<v Speaker 2>I know he's arrested.</v>

2353
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:36.960
<v Speaker 2>I know he lost his license and he had given back.</v>

2354
01:12:36.961 --> 01:12:38.890
<v Speaker 2>It was during the beginning of the medical marijuana.</v>

2355
01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:39.421
<v Speaker 4>It's funny.</v>

2356
01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:42.030
<v Speaker 4>Back then you could use lose your license for being involved in this.</v>

2357
01:12:42.031 --> 01:12:44.040
<v Speaker 4>Now you have to use your license</v>

2358
01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.780
<v Speaker 2>to get people pot.</v>

2359
01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:46.201
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2360
01:12:46.201 --> 01:12:46.920
<v Speaker 2>yOu know,</v>

2361
01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:47.100
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2362
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:51.960
<v Speaker 2>I was turned onto the whole medical marijuana scene in part by my friend todd</v>

2363
01:12:51.961 --> 01:12:52.501
<v Speaker 2>mccormick.</v>

2364
01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:57.501
<v Speaker 2>Do you know todd taught store my friend todd is a really brilliant guy when it</v>

2365
01:12:57.541 --> 01:13:01.700
<v Speaker 2>comes to any knowledge of cannabis or hamper the history behind it and the</v>

2366
01:13:01.701 --> 01:13:04.110
<v Speaker 2>suppression of it had cancer himself,</v>

2367
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:04.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2368
01:13:05.050 --> 01:13:06.480
<v Speaker 2>he needs marijuana.</v>

2369
01:13:06.481 --> 01:13:07.314
<v Speaker 2>Like literally,</v>

2370
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:08.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2371
01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.200
<v Speaker 2>and knowing him,</v>

2372
01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:15.120
<v Speaker 2>I got to meet all sorts of people like that that are inside the medical</v>

2373
01:13:15.121 --> 01:13:20.040
<v Speaker 2>community and most of them are doing a great service.</v>

2374
01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:20.431
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2375
01:13:20.431 --> 01:13:23.760
<v Speaker 2>most of 'em are getting weed to people and you know,</v>

2376
01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:25.290
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong with that,</v>

2377
01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:29.130
<v Speaker 2>but there's a few of them out there that it just like the people in northern</v>

2378
01:13:29.131 --> 01:13:31.420
<v Speaker 2>California saying we should keep it illegal because they make more money.</v>

2379
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.351
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2380
01:13:32.351 --> 01:13:33.630
<v Speaker 2>That's big,</v>

2381
01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:34.021
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2382
01:13:34.021 --> 01:13:37.270
<v Speaker 2>That just shows you how twisted government is that somebody's always benefits</v>

2383
01:13:37.271 --> 01:13:37.381
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2384
01:13:37.381 --> 01:13:38.940
<v Speaker 2>wants to benefit from the violence.</v>

2385
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:42.240
<v Speaker 2>It's just sad that anybody would ever want a profit on keeping something from.</v>

2386
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.940
<v Speaker 2>From everybody when I know it would be good for everybody.</v>

2387
01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:48.090
<v Speaker 2>You know the fact that you would vote against legalization while you're selling</v>

2388
01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:48.421
<v Speaker 2>pot.</v>

2389
01:13:48.421 --> 01:13:49.254
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2390
01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:49.681
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2391
01:13:49.681 --> 01:13:50.600
<v Speaker 2>that's not good for you.</v>

2392
01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.410
<v Speaker 2>You're making a real creepy decision,</v>

2393
01:13:52.411 --> 01:13:53.244
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2394
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:55.950
<v Speaker 2>Burning you would still be okay.</v>

2395
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Everybody thinks that like people are going to grow the wheat.</v>

2396
01:13:58.321 --> 01:13:59.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to grow my weight.</v>

2397
01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:00.750
<v Speaker 2>What I pay fOr weed right now,</v>

2398
01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:01.381
<v Speaker 2>it's perfect.</v>

2399
01:14:01.381 --> 01:14:02.430
<v Speaker 2>I'll keep paying that forever.</v>

2400
01:14:02.431 --> 01:14:02.970
<v Speaker 2>You don't need it.</v>

2401
01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:04.110
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has to lose any money.</v>

2402
01:14:04.290 --> 01:14:05.940
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be country about this whole thing.</v>

2403
01:14:06.130 --> 01:14:07.560
<v Speaker 2>It's just completely ridiculous.</v>

<v Speaker 2>If you want to grow fucking tomatoes,</v>

2414
01:14:16.841 --> 01:14:17.950
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to grow tomatoes.</v>

2415
01:14:17.951 --> 01:14:18.784
<v Speaker 2>It should be legal.</v>

<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2417

<v Speaker 4>it's going to be like who would grow tobacco?</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2419
01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.090
<v Speaker 4>Eventually that's what it's going to be,</v>

2420
01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:23.511
<v Speaker 4>but I want,</v>

2421
01:14:23.511 --> 01:14:23.820
<v Speaker 4>I want,</v>

2422
01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:26.930
<v Speaker 4>I want to tell a little story about my experience this morning because I haven't</v>

2423
01:14:26.931 --> 01:14:27.800
<v Speaker 4>really had a blast.</v>

2424
01:14:27.801 --> 01:14:32.240
<v Speaker 4>We went right across the street to la confidential and it's one of the</v>

2425
01:14:32.241 --> 01:14:35.130
<v Speaker 4>dispensary's in the hollywood area and in place.</v>

2426
01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.280
<v Speaker 4>I want to give them a shout out.</v>

2427
01:14:37.281 --> 01:14:39.020
<v Speaker 4>This was a real operate confidential.</v>

2428
01:14:39.021 --> 01:14:39.111
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

2429
01:14:39.111 --> 01:14:39.681
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2430
01:14:39.681 --> 01:14:40.311
<v Speaker 4>I guess not,</v>

2431
01:14:40.311 --> 01:14:40.671
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to,</v>

2432
01:14:40.671 --> 01:14:42.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to call out people by name because they were.</v>

2433
01:14:42.471 --> 01:14:43.150
<v Speaker 4>They were awesome.</v>

2434
01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:43.581
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2435
01:14:43.581 --> 01:14:43.691
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

2436
01:14:43.691 --> 01:14:44.211
<v Speaker 4>And they said,</v>

2437
01:14:44.211 --> 01:14:46.670
<v Speaker 4>they said that they're not allowed to.</v>

2438
01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:47.930
<v Speaker 4>You're setting a precedent.</v>

2439
01:14:47.931 --> 01:14:50.120
<v Speaker 4>You will have to give shout outs all the time from now on.</v>

2440
01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:50.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2441
01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:51.230
<v Speaker 4>anybody stops.</v>

2442
01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:53.170
<v Speaker 4>You also have.</v>

2443
01:14:53.210 --> 01:14:57.350
<v Speaker 4>You'll also see I have an ulterior motive here because the guy at the front,</v>

2444
01:14:57.351 --> 01:15:00.980
<v Speaker 4>his name was jeff and he looked like the character from south park who's dead.</v>

2445
01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:03.470
<v Speaker 4>I'll just sad,</v>

2446
01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:04.250
<v Speaker 4>sad.</v>

2447
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:04.821
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

2448
01:15:04.821 --> 01:15:07.010
<v Speaker 4>I didn't mean to derail my story with that tragedy.</v>

2449
01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:07.221
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2450
01:15:07.221 --> 01:15:08.680
<v Speaker 4>I did it real.</v>

2451
01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.900
<v Speaker 4>I was just thinking about the cartoon,</v>

2452
01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.033
<v Speaker 4>but anyways,</v>

2453
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:13.790
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

2454
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:14.211
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

2455
01:15:14.211 --> 01:15:14.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2456
01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:14.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2457
01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:17.430
<v Speaker 4>we weren't allowed to film in there and they were very professional about it and</v>

2458
01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:20.330
<v Speaker 4>who was understandable and they had a no cellphone policy,</v>

2459
01:15:20.331 --> 01:15:21.170
<v Speaker 4>but they had,</v>

2460
01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:21.580
<v Speaker 4>they had,</v>

2461
01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:22.910
<v Speaker 4>they have a separate bar in the back.</v>

2462
01:15:22.911 --> 01:15:23.700
<v Speaker 4>so at first I went,</v>

2463
01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:24.560
<v Speaker 4>I talked to this,</v>

2464
01:15:24.561 --> 01:15:26.150
<v Speaker 4>a lovely young woman,</v>

2465
01:15:26.151 --> 01:15:26.984
<v Speaker 4>mickey,</v>

2466
01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:28.850
<v Speaker 4>and this is my ulterior motive.</v>

2467
01:15:28.851 --> 01:15:30.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of hoping that by giving her a shout out,</v>

2468
01:15:30.561 --> 01:15:31.730
<v Speaker 4>she will actually call me,</v>

2469
01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:32.231
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2470
01:15:32.231 --> 01:15:33.860
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to get laid on this show.</v>

2471
01:15:33.861 --> 01:15:34.700
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>

2472
01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:35.803
<v Speaker 4>How dare you.</v>

2473
01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:39.560
<v Speaker 4>And it's such a mad struggle and don't ever do that.</v>

2474
01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:40.940
<v Speaker 4>That's a terrible idea.</v>

2475
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:42.190
<v Speaker 4>Terrible idea.</v>

2476
01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:42.851
<v Speaker 2>She'd never do that.</v>

2477
01:15:42.851 --> 01:15:46.090
<v Speaker 2>If you can't get laid without mentioning a chicken here or even get to her to</v>

2478
01:15:46.091 --> 01:15:46.900
<v Speaker 2>hang out with you,</v>

2479
01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:48.700
<v Speaker 2>how much interest could she possibly have?</v>

2480
01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:52.150
<v Speaker 2>The last thing you want to do is give a shout out on the air because what if</v>

2481
01:15:52.151 --> 01:15:52.984
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't work out?</v>

2482
01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:54.190
<v Speaker 2>What if this doesn't work out?</v>

2483
01:15:54.191 --> 01:15:55.630
<v Speaker 2>And then like a year from now,</v>

2484
01:15:55.631 --> 01:15:57.610
<v Speaker 2>your new wife who you love more than anything,</v>

2485
01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.330

2486
01:15:58.330 --> 01:15:59.620

2492
01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:05.553
<v Speaker 2>Who's nicky?</v>

2493
01:16:06.190 --> 01:16:06.461
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Nicky didn't work out.</v>

2496
01:16:08.290 --> 01:16:08.800
<v Speaker 2>She didn't.</v>

2497
01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:08.951

2500
01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:11.524
<v Speaker 2>but she didn't.</v>

2501
01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:13.420
<v Speaker 2>She didn't go out with me like you.</v>

2502

<v Speaker 2>You're still lose hope and you.</v>

2510
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:32.290
<v Speaker 4>The customer service is really incredible.</v>

2511
01:16:32.291 --> 01:16:33.400
<v Speaker 4>It's my first time buying,</v>

2512
01:16:33.401 --> 01:16:34.031
<v Speaker 4>but I had gone to.</v>

2513
01:16:34.031 --> 01:16:34.721
<v Speaker 4>They're all high man.</v>

2514
01:16:34.721 --> 01:16:35.770
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be real friendly.</v>

2515
01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.950
<v Speaker 4>I went to the club and breckenridge in Colorado,</v>

2516
01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.000
<v Speaker 4>the breckenridge cannabis club.</v>

2517
01:16:40.001 --> 01:16:42.910
<v Speaker 4>And for my youtube channel we did a recording with my friend job weeks there</v>

2519
01:16:45.311 --> 01:16:46.180
<v Speaker 4>This was really exciting.</v>

2520
01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:46.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2521
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:48.850
<v Speaker 4>So they explained that they,</v>

2522
01:16:48.851 --> 01:16:53.851
<v Speaker 4>they have their own talk about monetary policy because this was really awesome,</v>

2523
01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:55.720
<v Speaker 4>but mickey was,</v>

2524
01:16:55.721 --> 01:16:56.551
<v Speaker 4>was really helpful.</v>

2525
01:16:56.551 --> 01:16:57.231
<v Speaker 4>I got as a,</v>

2526
01:16:57.231 --> 01:16:58.630
<v Speaker 4>as a first time or discount,</v>

2527
01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:03.350
<v Speaker 4>a free hit of hash and I had never had this before where they,</v>

2528
01:17:03.351 --> 01:17:06.750
<v Speaker 4>they use the blow torch over the little metal device in,</v>

2529
01:17:06.751 --> 01:17:10.190
<v Speaker 4>into the front of the bomb and they gave me two half</v>

2530
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:11.820
<v Speaker 5>hits that were like for me,</v>

2531
01:17:11.821 --> 01:17:12.561
<v Speaker 5>a huge,</v>

2532
01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:15.680
<v Speaker 5>huge rips of hash that knocked me on my ass and they have this beautiful</v>

2533
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:17.180
<v Speaker 5>smoker's lounge in the bag.</v>

2534
01:17:17.181 --> 01:17:17.811
<v Speaker 5>Jake was there,</v>

2535
01:17:17.811 --> 01:17:18.501
<v Speaker 5>very helpful.</v>

2536
01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:18.810
<v Speaker 5>It was a,</v>

2537
01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:20.180
<v Speaker 5>it was a wonderful experIence.</v>

2538
01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:22.160
<v Speaker 5>And I asked them if there was,</v>

2539
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:24.530
<v Speaker 5>if I could plug their business and they said,</v>

2540
01:17:24.531 --> 01:17:26.510
<v Speaker 5>well we can't tell you what to say but you know,</v>

2541
01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:26.781
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2542
01:17:26.781 --> 01:17:26.991
<v Speaker 5>is there,</v>

2543
01:17:26.991 --> 01:17:29.570
<v Speaker 5>is there any message that you want to get out?</v>

2544
01:17:29.571 --> 01:17:30.620
<v Speaker 5>And they said get involved,</v>

2545
01:17:30.621 --> 01:17:30.891
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2546
01:17:30.891 --> 01:17:34.010
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's really cool to see that most people aren't like those growers</v>

2547
01:17:34.011 --> 01:17:34.880
<v Speaker 5>in northern California.</v>

2548
01:17:34.881 --> 01:17:36.680
<v Speaker 5>They want people to get involved in the issue.</v>

2549
01:17:36.681 --> 01:17:37.590
<v Speaker 5>They want people working in,</v>

2550
01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:38.040
<v Speaker 5>as he's,</v>

2551
01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.410
<v Speaker 5>as chef specifically said,</v>

2552
01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:40.640
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

2553
01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:43.160
<v Speaker 5>this could be if it was fully legal,</v>

2554
01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:45.350
<v Speaker 5>classify what you're saying.</v>

2555
01:17:45.351 --> 01:17:48.110
<v Speaker 5>The reason why the people are in northern California or intuit is because</v>

2556
01:17:48.111 --> 01:17:49.160
<v Speaker 5>they're selling it illegally.</v>

2557
01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.260
<v Speaker 5>They they want it to stay illegal.</v>

2558
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.590
<v Speaker 5>They will either a lot of them,</v>

2559
01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:54.830
<v Speaker 5>but the grower,</v>

2560
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:56.810
<v Speaker 5>the growers that are selling to dispensary's,</v>

2561
01:17:56.811 --> 01:17:58.910
<v Speaker 5>they're not the ones who are voting against legality.</v>

2562
01:17:59.090 --> 01:18:00.920
<v Speaker 5>A lot of it is the guys who've been doing it,</v>

2563
01:18:00.921 --> 01:18:03.980
<v Speaker 5>old school where it's just completely accepted up there.</v>

2564
01:18:03.981 --> 01:18:08.840
<v Speaker 5>I mean a big part of humboldt county is comedy is based on marijuana.</v>

2565
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:11.780
<v Speaker 5>That has just a fact and it's just been sort of accepted,</v>

2566
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:14.780
<v Speaker 5>but now not so much,</v>

2567
01:18:14.781 --> 01:18:15.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2568
01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:16.060
<v Speaker 5>now it's a.</v>

2569
01:18:16.290 --> 01:18:20.870
<v Speaker 5>Then they also had the problem with mexican gangs that are running these forest.</v>

2570
01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:24.190
<v Speaker 5>They set up these things in national forest,</v>

2571
01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:26.060
<v Speaker 5>but put up these farms.</v>

2572
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:28.640
<v Speaker 5>Even the people here in the dispensary's have an interest in the law,</v>

2573
01:18:28.641 --> 01:18:29.630
<v Speaker 5>not changing.</v>

2574
01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:30.471
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2575
01:18:30.471 --> 01:18:34.370
<v Speaker 5>Like they haven't because it know if it's fully legalized they just switch over</v>

2576
01:18:34.371 --> 01:18:36.080
<v Speaker 5>and start selling it or they have the same.</v>

2577
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.321
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2578
01:18:36.321 --> 01:18:37.160
<v Speaker 5>they have the same,</v>

2579
01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:39.020
<v Speaker 5>the same bullshit.</v>

2580
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:42.380
<v Speaker 5>Financial interest in the current government restricted system that the people</v>

2581
01:18:42.381 --> 01:18:44.120
<v Speaker 5>in northern California too and and most people.</v>

2582
01:18:44.121 --> 01:18:46.370
<v Speaker 5>My point is most people are good people and the people that are like</v>

2583
01:18:46.371 --> 01:18:47.900
<v Speaker 5>confidential are good people.</v>

2584
01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:52.700
<v Speaker 5>Somebody I think you're saying that you believe that you know how everyone who</v>

2585
01:18:52.701 --> 01:18:55.480
<v Speaker 5>runs a dispensary thinks and you know you can't.</v>

2586
01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:56.960
<v Speaker 5>It's real hard to say that,</v>

2587
01:18:56.961 --> 01:18:57.794
<v Speaker 5>that they know.</v>

2588
01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:58.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying my sense no,</v>

2589
01:18:58.910 --> 01:19:02.000
<v Speaker 5>because I do know other people that are involved in the industry,</v>

2590
01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:04.910
<v Speaker 5>but that's not necessarily bad for them.</v>

2591
01:19:04.911 --> 01:19:05.810
<v Speaker 5>If it becomes legal,</v>

2592
01:19:05.811 --> 01:19:07.460
<v Speaker 5>they just can open up a weed shop.</v>

2593
01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:11.050
<v Speaker 5>They can switch from a medical dispensary slash no,</v>

2594
01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:11.660
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2595
01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:11.870
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2596
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:13.310
<v Speaker 5>because it'll be more commercialized.</v>

2597
01:19:13.311 --> 01:19:15.560
<v Speaker 5>There'll be selling it at a walmart in the cigarette section.</v>

2598
01:19:15.561 --> 01:19:16.131
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

2599
01:19:16.131 --> 01:19:18.350
<v Speaker 5>Like or with liquor stores it'll be,</v>

2600
01:19:18.351 --> 01:19:18.971
<v Speaker 5>it'll be,</v>

2601
01:19:18.971 --> 01:19:20.360
<v Speaker 5>it will be specialty shops,</v>

2602
01:19:20.361 --> 01:19:22.520
<v Speaker 5>but there was more competition you'll have,</v>

2603
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:26.000
<v Speaker 5>you'll end up in more legalization will end up with a greater consolidation in</v>

2604
01:19:26.001 --> 01:19:26.540
<v Speaker 5>the market.</v>

2605
01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.160
<v Speaker 5>I don't necessarily think that's the case.</v>

2606
01:19:28.161 --> 01:19:30.080
<v Speaker 5>If it's to sell weed,</v>

2607
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.690
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

2608
01:19:30.690 --> 01:19:33.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean why would it have to be so expensive that you'd have to go through</v>

2609
01:19:33.111 --> 01:19:34.940
<v Speaker 5>walmart with its thousand employees?</v>

2610
01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:36.860
<v Speaker 5>Why you could sell weed.</v>

2611
01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:38.060
<v Speaker 5>You could have like little locally,</v>

2612
01:19:38.061 --> 01:19:38.894
<v Speaker 5>locally.</v>

2613
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.670
<v Speaker 5>There would be more.</v>

2614
01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:41.740
<v Speaker 5>There will be more competition.</v>

2615
01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:42.050
<v Speaker 5>Wonder,</v>

2616
01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:44.750
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how long it would take before marijuana is legal.</v>

2617
01:19:44.751 --> 01:19:47.480
<v Speaker 5>As before coca cola gotten business and started saying,</v>

2618
01:19:47.481 --> 01:19:47.961
<v Speaker 5>listen man,</v>

2619
01:19:47.961 --> 01:19:48.440
<v Speaker 5>we need to.</v>

2620
01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:48.790
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2621
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:49.623
<v Speaker 5>there's a big business.</v>

2622
01:19:49.710 --> 01:19:50.543
<v Speaker 5>Let's get a piece.</v>

2623
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:54.500
<v Speaker 5>It's really fun to apply the economics of this and then you start to understand</v>

2624
01:19:54.501 --> 01:19:58.280
<v Speaker 5>why the violence is happening in Mexico because their business is being shredded</v>

2625
01:19:58.281 --> 01:20:01.910
<v Speaker 5>and they're fighting over a territory that is rapidly shrinking.</v>

2626
01:20:02.370 --> 01:20:02.660
<v Speaker 5>I would.</v>

2627
01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:03.270
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

2628
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 5>THat's because marijuana or drugs are illegal</v>

2629
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:08.813
<v Speaker 4>in this country.</v>

2630
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:10.170
<v Speaker 4>Swag anymore.</v>

2631
01:20:10.171 --> 01:20:12.360
<v Speaker 4>In America it's hard to find it.</v>

2632
01:20:12.361 --> 01:20:14.310
<v Speaker 4>Shitty mexican trash compactor.</v>

2633
01:20:14.311 --> 01:20:16.350
<v Speaker 4>We'd like the shit I used to get in high school for,</v>

2634
01:20:16.370 --> 01:20:16.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2635
01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.390
<v Speaker 4>$80 an ounce or whatever it was.</v>

2636
01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.430
<v Speaker 4>You can't find that anymore.</v>

2637
01:20:20.431 --> 01:20:21.031
<v Speaker 4>I had this epiphany.</v>

2638
01:20:21.031 --> 01:20:23.610
<v Speaker 4>I was in Kansas city where it's as illegal as it is anywhere else.</v>

2639
01:20:23.611 --> 01:20:24.500
<v Speaker 4>I was there for,</v>

2640
01:20:24.501 --> 01:20:29.070
<v Speaker 4>for a gig a couple of weeks ago trying to buy weed and it was like we were</v>

2641
01:20:29.071 --> 01:20:29.500
<v Speaker 4>trying to.</v>

2642
01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:30.510
<v Speaker 4>We were joking about it,</v>

2643
01:20:30.511 --> 01:20:33.740
<v Speaker 4>but we actually trying to find shitty weed to see if we could do it and we</v>

2644
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:34.410
<v Speaker 4>couldn't,</v>

2645
01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:34.831
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2646
01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:37.770
<v Speaker 4>I bet east coast you could still find find in Ohio.</v>

2647
01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:39.650
<v Speaker 4>I got a couple months ago.</v>

2648
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:41.251
<v Speaker 4>It's out there,</v>

2649
01:20:41.251 --> 01:20:42.084
<v Speaker 4>you can get it,</v>

2650
01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:45.090
<v Speaker 4>but you see how much it's because when it's,</v>

2651
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:49.290
<v Speaker 4>when it's illegal in California and it's still gray market for producers,</v>

2652
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:52.860
<v Speaker 4>it puts pressure on the market in places where it's harder to grow and so people</v>

2653
01:20:52.861 --> 01:20:56.670
<v Speaker 4>are able to get better weed from the surplus in California and it's a better</v>

2654
01:20:56.671 --> 01:20:57.300
<v Speaker 4>deal for them.</v>

2655
01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:59.430
<v Speaker 4>Then they get the ship that's up from Mexico.</v>

2656
01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.890
<v Speaker 4>I did comedy at that la confidential.</v>

2657
01:21:01.891 --> 01:21:06.240
<v Speaker 4>they used to do a or like a comedy shows there and I did it with joey dia's,</v>

2658
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.610
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2659
01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:09.690
<v Speaker 4>la confidential.</v>

2660
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:11.820
<v Speaker 4>And they have like a stage in the backyard they used to.</v>

2661
01:21:11.821 --> 01:21:13.110
<v Speaker 4>They stopped doing it though I heard.</v>

2662
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:14.180
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2663
01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:17.100
<v Speaker 4>but it was crazy because if you were on later in the show,</v>

2664
01:21:17.101 --> 01:21:18.390
<v Speaker 4>like I was like second to last,</v>

2665
01:21:18.391 --> 01:21:19.050
<v Speaker 4>I was uh,</v>

2666
01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:20.790
<v Speaker 4>right after joey diaz or something like that.</v>

2667
01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:22.590
<v Speaker 4>A beginning of show was awesome.</v>

2668
01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.820
<v Speaker 4>Second part of the show,</v>

2669
01:21:23.910 --> 01:21:28.830
<v Speaker 4>everyone was so fucked up from doing hash and fucking weed and stuff like that.</v>

2670
01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.680
<v Speaker 4>Sitting at with drool coming out of their mouth.</v>

2671
01:21:31.710 --> 01:21:34.830
<v Speaker 4>Just looking at the movements you're doing with your hands too.</v>

2672
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:40.430
<v Speaker 2>Did a show who the fuck that I do a toronto with?</v>

2673
01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:42.090
<v Speaker 2>It was either a sam trip.</v>

2674
01:21:42.091 --> 01:21:42.391
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2675
01:21:42.391 --> 01:21:42.890
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't.</v>

2676
01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:44.260
<v Speaker 2>It was the ra should fear at thompson.</v>

2677
01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I forget who it was,</v>

2678
01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:48.210
<v Speaker 2>but we did it in this place in toronto.</v>

2679
01:21:48.211 --> 01:21:48.950
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2680
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:51.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say the name because it's probably illegal what they're doing,</v>

2681
01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:55.500
<v Speaker 2>but they have a pot shop and the front where they sell bongs and shit in the</v>

2682
01:21:55.501 --> 01:21:56.160
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

2683
01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.480
<v Speaker 2>They have a hot box,</v>

2684
01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:58.470
<v Speaker 2>this is a hot box.</v>

2685
01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.730
<v Speaker 2>Got 100 people boxed in with no fucking ventilation whatsoever,</v>

2686
01:22:02.731 --> 01:22:07.731
<v Speaker 2>and everybody's hitting bongs and vaporizers and they're passing blunts.</v>

2687
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:12.450
<v Speaker 2>The air is so ridiculously unhealthy and healthy.</v>

2688
01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:15.600
<v Speaker 2>It's all smoke that can't.</v>

2689
01:22:15.601 --> 01:22:15.951
<v Speaker 2>You got to.</v>

2690
01:22:15.951 --> 01:22:17.280
<v Speaker 2>It should be a little smoke,</v>

2691
01:22:17.281 --> 01:22:18.060
<v Speaker 2>a little air,</v>

2692
01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:21.810
<v Speaker 2>a little smoke of this was just nothing but smoke to the point where the next</v>

2693
01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:23.190
<v Speaker 2>day my throat was sore.</v>

2694
01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:23.521
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2695
01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:23.851
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2696
01:22:23.851 --> 01:22:24.780
<v Speaker 2>I might be fucked.</v>

2697
01:22:24.781 --> 01:22:28.200
<v Speaker 2>I was worried that it was going to mess with my voice because it was nothing but</v>

2698
01:22:28.201 --> 01:22:29.490
<v Speaker 2>smoke for like an hour.</v>

2699
01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.050
<v Speaker 2>I've never been that high in my life.</v>

2700
01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.130
<v Speaker 2>It was ridiculous.</v>

2701
01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:32.993
<v Speaker 2>It was so.</v>

2702
01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:35.770
<v Speaker 2>There was so much thc in the air and no,</v>

2703
01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:40.740
<v Speaker 2>there was no air was all thc and carbon dioxide has bad breath and people just</v>

2704
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:43.050
<v Speaker 2>blitzkrieg I don't even remember what I talked about.</v>

2705
01:22:43.170 --> 01:22:46.070
<v Speaker 2>I'd bet I did maybe five minutes of material in an hour onstage.</v>

2706
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:49.020
<v Speaker 2>It was preposterous,</v>

2707

<v Speaker 4>Just for this.</v>

2748
01:24:00.931 --> 01:24:01.651
<v Speaker 4>It kind of worked out.</v>

2749
01:24:01.651 --> 01:24:02.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't really realize that,</v>

2750
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:03.631
<v Speaker 4>that it worked out,</v>

2751
01:24:03.631 --> 01:24:07.590
<v Speaker 4>but I was in Colorado for the mountain hours event and then it was able.</v>

2752
01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:08.580
<v Speaker 4>I was able to come here.</v>

2753
01:24:08.581 --> 01:24:08.920
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>

2754
01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.240
<v Speaker 5>Well we got distracted by weed man.</v>

2755
01:24:10.241 --> 01:24:10.751
<v Speaker 5>We were actually,</v>

2756
01:24:10.751 --> 01:24:11.584
<v Speaker 5>when you want to tell me about,</v>

2757
01:24:11.930 --> 01:24:15.370
<v Speaker 5>I want to hear the currency thing that you would tell me before the show about</v>

2758
01:24:15.371 --> 01:24:16.720
<v Speaker 5>the they have their own currency.</v>

2759
01:24:16.721 --> 01:24:16.950
<v Speaker 5>See?</v>

2760
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:17.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2761
01:24:17.190 --> 01:24:22.190
<v Speaker 4>well let's come back to that because we were talking about the perspective,</v>

2762
01:24:22.711 --> 01:24:23.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2763
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:24.930
<v Speaker 4>how I used to be asleep,</v>

2764
01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:25.923
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2765
01:24:26.010 --> 01:24:31.010
<v Speaker 4>And how so many in in my audience are excited to have me appear on your podcast</v>

2766
01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:36.780
<v Speaker 4>and to be able to share this perspective with you because it's about sharing the</v>

2767
01:24:36.781 --> 01:24:39.840
<v Speaker 4>joy of standing out to government,</v>

2768
01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:44.130
<v Speaker 4>of standing up to the bully of actually seeing yourself as part of this process</v>

2769
01:24:44.370 --> 01:24:45.840
<v Speaker 4>of humanity evolving.</v>

2770
01:24:46.050 --> 01:24:49.680
<v Speaker 4>And they know that you share a lot of the premises of this,</v>

2771
01:24:49.681 --> 01:24:49.811
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

2772
01:24:49.811 --> 01:24:51.600
<v Speaker 4>of distrust for authority of,</v>

2773
01:24:51.601 --> 01:24:52.000
<v Speaker 4>of you.</v>

2774
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.630
<v Speaker 4>You're good understanding of what government is.</v>

2775
01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:54.811
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2776
01:24:54.811 --> 01:24:54.991
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2777
01:24:54.991 --> 01:24:56.460
<v Speaker 4>and the exploitation behind it,</v>

2778
01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:57.600
<v Speaker 4>but what,</v>

2779
01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:02.490
<v Speaker 4>what we're doing is actually working to change the paradigm and get people more</v>

2780
01:25:02.491 --> 01:25:03.150
<v Speaker 4>involved.</v>

2781
01:25:03.150 --> 01:25:07.020
<v Speaker 4>We're not so much a political movement as an anti political movement and that</v>

2782
01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:08.040
<v Speaker 4>we're not.</v>

2783
01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:11.760
<v Speaker 4>We understand that politics is pathological behavior when you're,</v>

2784
01:25:11.761 --> 01:25:14.220
<v Speaker 4>when you're advocating for more government control,</v>

2785
01:25:14.221 --> 01:25:16.740
<v Speaker 4>when you're saying that we need government to do this and,</v>

2786
01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:21.760
<v Speaker 4>and we are helping humanity by spreading this message that it is a universal</v>

2787
01:25:21.841 --> 01:25:23.630
<v Speaker 4>moral message of that,</v>

2788
01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:24.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2789
01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:24.601
<v Speaker 4>don't hit,</v>

2790
01:25:24.601 --> 01:25:25.291
<v Speaker 4>don't steal,</v>

2791
01:25:25.291 --> 01:25:30.291
<v Speaker 4>not unless you have a badge or a gun of the government,</v>

2792
01:25:30.631 --> 01:25:30.811
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2793
01:25:30.811 --> 01:25:34.500
<v Speaker 4>government is an opinion with a gun and getting people to see that and move past</v>

2794
01:25:34.501 --> 01:25:34.680
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2795
01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.640
<v Speaker 4>And as,</v>

2796
01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:37.050
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

2797
01:25:37.050 --> 01:25:38.070
<v Speaker 4>as activists,</v>

2798
01:25:38.071 --> 01:25:38.341
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2799
01:25:38.341 --> 01:25:38.980
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

2800
01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:42.090
<v Speaker 4>it's funny you talked about what it's like being a celebrity for yourself and</v>

2801
01:25:42.450 --> 01:25:43.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2802
01:25:43.150 --> 01:25:43.620
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2803
01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:44.940
<v Speaker 4>you're a legitimate celebrity.</v>

2804
01:25:44.970 --> 01:25:48.030
<v Speaker 4>And then there's like there's political celebrity and then there's me minor</v>

2805
01:25:48.090 --> 01:25:53.090
<v Speaker 4>political celebrity and I still get some of the same experience of people having</v>

2806
01:25:53.911 --> 01:25:56.130
<v Speaker 4>a relationship with me before you meet them and,</v>

2807
01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:59.450
<v Speaker 4>and you know who that is and what,</v>

2808
01:25:59.451 --> 01:25:59.661
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2809
01:25:59.661 --> 01:26:00.390
<v Speaker 4>what though,</v>

2810
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:01.500
<v Speaker 4>what you have with,</v>

2811
01:26:01.530 --> 01:26:02.640
<v Speaker 4>with your presence,</v>

2812
01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:03.920
<v Speaker 4>your ability</v>

2813
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.260
<v Speaker 5>to get people to get more involved,</v>

2814
01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:08.120
<v Speaker 5>to share this perspective,</v>

2815
01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:11.480
<v Speaker 5>to enjoy standing up to the man that people,</v>

2816
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:15.190
<v Speaker 5>people in your position can use your presence to,</v>

2817
01:26:15.330 --> 01:26:17.660
<v Speaker 5>to better effect this change and be a part of this.</v>

2818
01:26:17.661 --> 01:26:18.830
<v Speaker 5>And I wanted to,</v>

2819
01:26:18.831 --> 01:26:22.280
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to open the podcast by saying I'm from the revolution and I'm here to</v>

2820
01:26:22.281 --> 01:26:23.114
<v Speaker 5>recruit you.</v>

2821
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:27.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how to respond to that last creepy part.</v>

2822
01:26:28.410 --> 01:26:29.720
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna need to work out together,</v>

2823
01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:32.803
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2838
01:26:50.290 --> 01:26:51.123
<v Speaker 5>It's in the.</v>

2839
01:26:51.210 --> 01:26:52.840
<v Speaker 5>Don't ask for it.</v>

2840
01:26:54.210 --> 01:26:55.043
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2841
01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:56.990
<v Speaker 5>you know adam can be your new flashlight.</v>

2842
01:26:58.460 --> 01:26:59.980
<v Speaker 5>Oh brian.</v>

2843

2844
01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:05.240
<v Speaker 5>That was so stupid that that's one of those things where you remember when you</v>

2845
01:27:05.241 --> 01:27:06.620
<v Speaker 5>did that show the other day and you're like,</v>

2846
01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:06.981
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2847
01:27:06.981 --> 01:27:07.191
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

2848
01:27:07.191 --> 01:27:08.090
<v Speaker 5>they didn't know who I was.</v>

2849
01:27:08.091 --> 01:27:08.870
<v Speaker 5>They hated me.</v>

2850
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:09.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2851
01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:11.060
<v Speaker 5>That's how normal person where you're asked to you.</v>

2852
01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:13.940
<v Speaker 5>It's like people didn't understand for years.</v>

2853
01:27:13.941 --> 01:27:15.350
<v Speaker 5>I had to tell people that he's.</v>

2854
01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:16.580
<v Speaker 5>He kind of grows on you.</v>

2855
01:27:16.581 --> 01:27:17.414
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird thing.</v>

2856
01:27:17.770 --> 01:27:18.603
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2857
01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:20.630
<v Speaker 5>It takes awhile for your sense of humor to make sense,</v>

2858
01:27:20.631 --> 01:27:22.790
<v Speaker 5>but even that you should be embarrassed about.</v>

2859
01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:23.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2860
01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:25.390
<v Speaker 5>Even you should be embarrassed about that last one ever.</v>

2861
01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:25.740
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

2862
01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.500
<v Speaker 5>I just imagine it would be funny.</v>

2863
01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:28.641
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

2864
01:27:28.641 --> 01:27:29.474
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's funny though.</v>

2865
01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.033
<v Speaker 5>A of card</v>

2866
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.960
<v Speaker 5>issues.</v>

2867
01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:33.530
<v Speaker 5>Kid.</v>

2868
01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:34.131
<v Speaker 5>You got issues.</v>

2869
01:27:34.131 --> 01:27:35.120
<v Speaker 5>You're not even high right now.</v>

2870
01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:35.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2871
01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:35.900
<v Speaker 5>I am.</v>

2872
01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:38.180
<v Speaker 5>I've been smoking all the whole time in the back.</v>

2873
01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:38.631
<v Speaker 5>That's what you do.</v>

2874
01:27:38.631 --> 01:27:39.320
<v Speaker 5>You leave.</v>

2875
01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:39.520
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2876
01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:42.260
<v Speaker 5>you know I'm going to say make it so you're not allowed to talk.</v>

2877
01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:43.460
<v Speaker 5>If you get over a certain high,</v>

2878
01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:45.260
<v Speaker 5>we need to get a breathalyzer test for you.</v>

2879
01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:46.581
<v Speaker 5>They should have that,</v>

2880
01:27:46.581 --> 01:27:47.030
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2881
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.850
<v Speaker 5>They don't have that,</v>

2882
01:27:47.850 --> 01:27:48.683
<v Speaker 5>but watch out.</v>

2883
01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:51.510
<v Speaker 5>They don't have weed breathalyzers today.</v>

2884
01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:53.300
<v Speaker 5>Like how much you've smoked,</v>

2885
01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:54.790
<v Speaker 5>like how fucked up you are?</v>

2886
01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:55.320
<v Speaker 5>Not.</v>

2887
01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:55.940
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2888
01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:57.320
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's relative.</v>

2889
01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:57.830
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2890
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:58.160
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2891
01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:03.160
<v Speaker 5>it's so hard to figure out like what is for you mean it's the same blood level,</v>

2892
01:28:03.621 --> 01:28:04.210
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2893
01:28:04.210 --> 01:28:05.750
<v Speaker 5>It's just your tolerance.</v>

2894
01:28:05.751 --> 01:28:07.940
<v Speaker 5>Your tolerance doesn't decrease it in your body.</v>

2895
01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:12.350
<v Speaker 5>So it's like you could have a little bit of pot in the person who's a fucking</v>

2896
01:28:12.351 --> 01:28:14.660
<v Speaker 5>rookie and they are going to be blasted,</v>

2897
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:17.080
<v Speaker 5>but if you carry that same amount of pot new,</v>

2898
01:28:17.150 --> 01:28:17.931
<v Speaker 5>you'll be fun.</v>

2899
01:28:17.931 --> 01:28:20.180
<v Speaker 5>So is there a thc levels or something?</v>

2900
01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:20.480
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2901
01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:24.440
<v Speaker 5>But I'm saying thc is something that your body gets comfortable with.</v>

2902
01:28:24.710 --> 01:28:25.950
<v Speaker 5>It could be alcohol too.</v>

2903
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:29.090
<v Speaker 5>This is why there should be an objective measurement of impairment.</v>

2904
01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:30.680
<v Speaker 5>None out with alcohol.</v>

2905
01:28:30.681 --> 01:28:31.420
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>

2906
01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:34.500
<v Speaker 5>it should be a body fat mike thing like where they do not be that.</v>

2907
01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:36.020
<v Speaker 5>It should be an impairment thing,</v>

2908
01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2909
01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.240
<v Speaker 5>I want it to be body fat.</v>

2910
01:28:38.241 --> 01:28:39.110
<v Speaker 5>Come on,</v>

2911
01:28:39.170 --> 01:28:40.880
<v Speaker 5>I got pulled over once and I wasn't drunk.</v>

2912
01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:43.700
<v Speaker 5>They thought I was and who was not.</v>

2913
01:28:43.701 --> 01:28:47.270
<v Speaker 5>I just dropped my cell phone in between my legs and I reached in and I changed</v>

2914
01:28:47.271 --> 01:28:48.104
<v Speaker 5>lanes for a second,</v>

2915
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:51.050
<v Speaker 5>but it was nobody near me but a cop behind me.</v>

2916
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.771
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2917

01:28:58.401 --> 01:28:59.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm not drunk at all,</v>

2926
01:28:59.870 --> 01:29:00.950
<v Speaker 5>like I just want you to know.</v>

2927
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:02.010

2928
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:05.210

2969
01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Is it</v>

2970
01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.570
<v Speaker 5>one beer an hour or something like that?</v>

2971
01:29:55.650 --> 01:29:56.340
<v Speaker 5>You say that,</v>

2972
01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:56.911
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know.</v>

2973
01:29:56.911 --> 01:29:58.350
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what that is.</v>

2974
01:29:58.351 --> 01:30:00.570
<v Speaker 5>Like when if you had a beer an hour ago,</v>

2975
01:30:00.571 --> 01:30:01.770
<v Speaker 5>you are noT fucking drunk.</v>

2976
01:30:01.810 --> 01:30:02.870
<v Speaker 5>Will you test drunk?</v>

2977
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:03.090
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2978
01:30:03.090 --> 01:30:03.270
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2979
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:05.580
<v Speaker 5>it's that you can oxidize one drink per hour.</v>

2980
01:30:05.581 --> 01:30:06.390
<v Speaker 5>So if you're one,</v>

2981
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:10.740
<v Speaker 5>if you drink the effect of that serving of alcohol is gone an hour.</v>

2982
01:30:10.741 --> 01:30:11.820
<v Speaker 5>If you have three drinks,</v>

2983
01:30:11.821 --> 01:30:13.320
<v Speaker 5>it's three hours for it to be gone.</v>

2984
01:30:14.010 --> 01:30:16.530
<v Speaker 5>Is that three hours that you can be tested for,</v>

2985
01:30:16.531 --> 01:30:18.450
<v Speaker 5>or three hours that you're impaired by?</v>

2986
01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:18.871
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2987
01:30:18.871 --> 01:30:19.740
<v Speaker 5>I don't drink anymore.</v>

2988
01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:20.430
<v Speaker 5>You don't drink at all?</v>

2989
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:21.000
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2990
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:21.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2991
01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:22.950
<v Speaker 5>occasionally I'll have a glass of wine,</v>

2992
01:30:22.951 --> 01:30:23.221
<v Speaker 5>but no,</v>

2993
01:30:23.221 --> 01:30:25.470
<v Speaker 5>I quit drinking the cops that I ran into a cool,</v>

2994
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:27.260
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't have to be,</v>

2995
01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:27.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2996
01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:28.650
<v Speaker 2>it could have been,</v>

2997
01:30:28.650 --> 01:30:31.220
<v Speaker 2>could have been coming off with some terrible people and I'm always very polite</v>

2998
01:30:31.221 --> 01:30:32.054
<v Speaker 2>if anything happens,</v>

2999
01:30:32.570 --> 01:30:33.740
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

3000
01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.670
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird feeling like you could just lock me up right now when you,</v>

3001
01:30:37.671 --> 01:30:41.660
<v Speaker 2>when you watch like the videos of those guys slamming you on the ground and</v>

3002
01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.800
<v Speaker 2>arresting everybody for hugging you,</v>

3003
01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:46.910
<v Speaker 2>you just want to go in and you just want to rest them.</v>

3004
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.040
<v Speaker 2>You want to just pull them out of society when it makes them,</v>

3005
01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:49.491
<v Speaker 2>make them,</v>

3006
01:30:49.491 --> 01:30:50.010
<v Speaker 2>watch this,</v>

3007
01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:52.010
<v Speaker 2>make them sit in the theater with people,</v>

3008
01:30:52.011 --> 01:30:54.470
<v Speaker 2>sit on the stage and I want you to sit in behind you.</v>

3009
01:30:54.471 --> 01:30:55.520
<v Speaker 2>We're going to play that video.</v>

3010
01:30:55.521 --> 01:30:57.410
<v Speaker 2>And then I want you to respond to all these people,</v>

3011
01:30:57.411 --> 01:30:58.041
<v Speaker 2>the citizens,</v>

3012
01:30:58.041 --> 01:30:58.874
<v Speaker 2>the tax payers.</v>

3013
01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:00.410
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have some questions for you.</v>

3014
01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:03.710
<v Speaker 2>they don't even have any vested interest and they have no emotional connection</v>

3015
01:31:03.711 --> 01:31:04.544
<v Speaker 2>to you or,</v>

3016
01:31:04.630 --> 01:31:05.450
<v Speaker 2>or adam.</v>

3017
01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:06.081
<v Speaker 2>And guess what?</v>

3018
01:31:06.081 --> 01:31:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Fuck face.</v>

3019
01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:09.890
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be a real uncomfortable feeling and people need to understand</v>

3020
01:31:09.891 --> 01:31:10.131
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3021
01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:13.280
<v Speaker 2>that that's what this whole thing called internet video and that's called the</v>

3022
01:31:13.281 --> 01:31:14.114
<v Speaker 2>free market.</v>

3023
01:31:14.170 --> 01:31:14.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3024
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:15.141
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

3025
01:31:15.141 --> 01:31:15.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3026
01:31:15.351 --> 01:31:16.090
<v Speaker 2>It's basically the same</v>

3027
01:31:16.090 --> 01:31:17.320
<v Speaker 5>and the government is out in front of that.</v>

3028
01:31:17.321 --> 01:31:19.180
<v Speaker 5>When you say government is going to run public safety,</v>

3029
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:20.110
<v Speaker 5>that's what you get.</v>

3030
01:31:20.110 --> 01:31:20.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3031
01:31:20.770 --> 01:31:21.011
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3032
01:31:21.011 --> 01:31:22.000
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't have to be that way.</v>

3033
01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:22.720
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

3034
01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.440
<v Speaker 5>First it will be much more of it.</v>

3035
01:31:24.450 --> 01:31:25.283
<v Speaker 5>I always say,</v>

3036
01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:26.350
<v Speaker 5>so you're on board.</v>

3037
01:31:26.351 --> 01:31:29.020
<v Speaker 5>I can sign you up for a tour with revolution,</v>

3038
01:31:29.021 --> 01:31:31.090
<v Speaker 5>but this podcast and I like to play pool.</v>

3039
01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:34.410
<v Speaker 5>Very busy doing comedy in the revolution.</v>

3040
01:31:34.411 --> 01:31:37.090
<v Speaker 5>If I'm amanda know you absolutely know what you absolutely are to be fair</v>

3041
01:31:37.091 --> 01:31:37.870
<v Speaker 5>because you are,</v>

3042
01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:41.530
<v Speaker 5>you are spreading important information and you are sharing a very important</v>

3043
01:31:41.531 --> 01:31:43.540
<v Speaker 5>perspective that is about challenging authority,</v>

3044
01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:46.130
<v Speaker 5>but you know there are lots about challenging yourself.</v>

3045
01:31:46.131 --> 01:31:46.750
<v Speaker 5>Next level.</v>

3046
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:48.340
<v Speaker 5>It's challenging yourself as well.</v>

3047
01:31:48.370 --> 01:31:51.790
<v Speaker 5>You know what I've always said is that what's going to change this world is the</v>

3048
01:31:51.791 --> 01:31:52.600
<v Speaker 5>youth,</v>

3049
01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:54.130
<v Speaker 5>the people that are growing up right now,</v>

3050
01:31:54.131 --> 01:31:56.590
<v Speaker 5>the people that are listening to this in their dorm rooms and people that are</v>

3051
01:31:56.591 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 5>listening to this and that are high school bedroom where trying to keep it down</v>

3052
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:02.530
<v Speaker 2>because her dad would yell at them because he disagrees with all the shit we're</v>

3053
01:32:02.531 --> 01:32:03.364
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

3054
01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Those Are the people that are going to be involved and exposed to information</v>

3055
01:32:08.201 --> 01:32:10.870
<v Speaker 2>that our generation and the previous generations,</v>

3056
01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:12.520
<v Speaker 2>that rumsfeld's of the world,</v>

3057
01:32:12.670 --> 01:32:14.980
<v Speaker 2>they never thought that this was going to be an option.</v>

3058
01:32:14.981 --> 01:32:18.880
<v Speaker 2>They never thought that information would be so freely distributed between</v>

3059
01:32:18.881 --> 01:32:19.990
<v Speaker 2>anyone everywhere,</v>

3060
01:32:19.991 --> 01:32:20.824
<v Speaker 2>all over the world.</v>

3061
01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:22.180
<v Speaker 2>That was never in the plan.</v>

3062
01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:24.160
<v Speaker 2>They thought they're going to be able to run shit.</v>

3063
01:32:24.161 --> 01:32:25.090
<v Speaker 2>Business as usual.</v>

3064
01:32:25.091 --> 01:32:28.690
<v Speaker 2>So what we're seeing now with world dominanCe and the craziness and the chaos of</v>

3065
01:32:28.691 --> 01:32:29.524
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy,</v>

3066
01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:32.980
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing like the the last ripples of this,</v>

3067
01:32:33.190 --> 01:32:35.170
<v Speaker 2>this emerging creature,</v>

3068
01:32:35.230 --> 01:32:39.490
<v Speaker 2>this emerging new human technology,</v>

3069
01:32:39.491 --> 01:32:40.324
<v Speaker 2>symbiotic.</v>

3070
01:32:40.570 --> 01:32:43.570
<v Speaker 2>So right now it's pushing all the old things out.</v>

3071
01:32:43.690 --> 01:32:48.100
<v Speaker 2>It's pushing all the old paradigms away and it's going to dissolve standard</v>

3072
01:32:48.101 --> 01:32:52.510
<v Speaker 2>forms of government and law enforcement to dissolve all that shit because you're</v>

3073
01:32:52.511 --> 01:32:54.460
<v Speaker 2>going to be a part of everybody.</v>

3074
01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:55.450
<v Speaker 2>It's going to happen.</v>

3075
01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:57.250
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's going.</v>

3076
01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:00.590
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be technological or it'll be the next stage of,</v>

3077
01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:03.400
<v Speaker 2>of our physical evolution if you you know,</v>

3078
01:33:03.401 --> 01:33:05.920
<v Speaker 2>if you're allowed to use that term when it comes to something that's</v>

3079
01:33:05.921 --> 01:33:06.970
<v Speaker 2>technologically driven,</v>

3080
01:33:06.971 --> 01:33:07.870
<v Speaker 2>because I think it may be.</v>

3081
01:33:07.871 --> 01:33:08.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3082
01:33:08.061 --> 01:33:11.440
<v Speaker 2>I think it may be something that someone creates and they create an ability to</v>

3083
01:33:11.441 --> 01:33:15.460
<v Speaker 2>enhance the human body and if you look at what they're doing now with genetic</v>

3084
01:33:15.461 --> 01:33:18.580
<v Speaker 2>engineering and they're creating fucking bladders and petri dishes,</v>

3085
01:33:18.581 --> 01:33:18.910
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>

3086
01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:21.090
<v Speaker 2>They're working on developing artificial organs there.</v>

3087
01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:21.910
<v Speaker 2>The workup.</v>

3088
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Eventually they're going to look at the.</v>

3089
01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:26.710
<v Speaker 2>Once they figure out more and more and more about the human body,</v>

3090
01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:28.810
<v Speaker 2>they're going to figure out parts of it and got to go.</v>

3091
01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.370
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna fix everything.</v>

3092
01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.140
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to turn this into.</v>

3093
01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:34.480
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to remove all the greed.</v>

3094
01:33:34.690 --> 01:33:37.570
<v Speaker 2>There's no more greed and we're going to install community.</v>

3095
01:33:37.810 --> 01:33:39.280
<v Speaker 2>This is the newest formula.</v>

3096
01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:41.240
<v Speaker 2>We've developed a new brain simpler</v>

3097
01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:41.660
<v Speaker 4>than that.</v>

3098
01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:44.570
<v Speaker 4>it's simpler than that therapy man therapy.</v>

3099
01:33:44.571 --> 01:33:46.520
<v Speaker 4>Everybody just gets therapy and government goes away.</v>

3100
01:33:47.210 --> 01:33:50.030
<v Speaker 4>What do you think that therapy iS good enough to work on everybody?</v>

3101
01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:50.601
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3102
01:33:50.601 --> 01:33:53.840
<v Speaker 4>eventually as we have greater prosperity in general,</v>

3103
01:33:53.841 --> 01:33:56.060
<v Speaker 4>we have more leisure time to address these issues.</v>

3104
01:33:56.061 --> 01:33:59.720
<v Speaker 4>We have more time that we're not spending scrambling to maintain our quality of</v>

3105
01:33:59.721 --> 01:33:59.931
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

3106
01:33:59.931 --> 01:34:00.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3107
01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:02.690
<v Speaker 4>I think that's one of one of the next phases we're going to be coming to.</v>

3108
01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:02.931
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3109
01:34:02.931 --> 01:34:04.100
<v Speaker 4>if we got an issue,</v>

3110
01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:07.010
<v Speaker 4>you have to start with the poorest part of the country.</v>

3111
01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:07.401
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3112
01:34:07.401 --> 01:34:08.180
<v Speaker 4>If you have,</v>

3113
01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:09.920
<v Speaker 4>if you're allowed to use your resources here,</v>

3114
01:34:09.921 --> 01:34:13.100
<v Speaker 4>only because otherwise we should start at the poorest part of the world.</v>

3115
01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:13.661
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3116
01:34:13.661 --> 01:34:17.030
<v Speaker 4>that's what you really should be trying to balance this whole motherfucker out.</v>

3117
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3118
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:20.210
<v Speaker 4>that should be the ultimate goal because it could have been no real peace.</v>

3119
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.421
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3120
01:34:20.421 --> 01:34:25.070
<v Speaker 4>the answer is some sort of every human being equitably into the market so then</v>

3121
01:34:25.071 --> 01:34:27.080
<v Speaker 4>means anybody can move to America.</v>

3122
01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:27.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3123
01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:28.940
<v Speaker 4>that's a problem.</v>

3124
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.670
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3125
01:34:29.670 --> 01:34:29.950
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

3126
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:32.240
<v Speaker 4>The highway is so fucking crowded right now.</v>

3127
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.781
<v Speaker 4>Do you know?</v>

3128
01:34:32.781 --> 01:34:33.261
<v Speaker 4>Crazy,</v>

3129
01:34:33.261 --> 01:34:35.720
<v Speaker 4>it would be if indians could just come here on their own free will.</v>

3130
01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:37.040
<v Speaker 4>There's a billion of them.</v>

3131
01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.100
<v Speaker 4>You ready to apply austrian economics in a way that's going to bake your noodle</v>

3132
01:34:40.101 --> 01:34:44.080
<v Speaker 4>just a little bit when you talk about roads and the government monopoly and</v>

3133
01:34:44.090 --> 01:34:44.840
<v Speaker 4>subsidization,</v>

3134
01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:47.690
<v Speaker 4>subsidization of the auto industry and the oil and gas industry.</v>

3135
01:34:48.230 --> 01:34:50.620
<v Speaker 4>If we didn't have the government doing that,</v>

3136
01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:53.600
<v Speaker 4>eisenhower who built the interstate highway system to serve the needs of the</v>

3137
01:34:53.601 --> 01:34:56.750
<v Speaker 4>military and like where I live in New Mexico or where I'm from in New Mexico</v>

3138
01:34:56.751 --> 01:34:57.770
<v Speaker 4>where the</v>

3139
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:01.850
<v Speaker 5>speaker of the state house can have an intersection move to where he wants it to</v>

3140
01:35:01.851 --> 01:35:05.450
<v Speaker 5>make his land worth more and we didn't have all that methane being forced into</v>

3141
01:35:05.451 --> 01:35:06.284
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3142
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:07.011
<v Speaker 5>We would.</v>

3143
01:35:07.011 --> 01:35:07.750
<v Speaker 5>We would be.</v>

3144
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:11.570
<v Speaker 5>You were already at the point where we should have cars that are self driving,</v>

3145
01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:14.540
<v Speaker 5>but if it wasn't for government keeping all this research and development</v>

3146
01:35:14.541 --> 01:35:15.890
<v Speaker 5>stifled with intellectual property,</v>

3147
01:35:15.891 --> 01:35:16.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3148
01:35:16.190 --> 01:35:17.210
<v Speaker 5>who killed the electric car?</v>

3149
01:35:17.211 --> 01:35:18.110
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen that documentary?</v>

3150
01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.810
<v Speaker 5>You can imagine how much you see.</v>

3151
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:24.640
<v Speaker 5>There's just that one government policy of intellectual property of so that oh,</v>

3152
01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:27.650
<v Speaker 5>you invented a battery and you bought a piece of paper that describes it from</v>

3153
01:35:27.651 --> 01:35:29.750
<v Speaker 5>someone you can keep that from humanity.</v>

3154
01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:30.340
<v Speaker 5>Do you know?</v>

3155
01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:30.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3156
01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.940
<v Speaker 5>do you see how much that holds us back?</v>

3157
01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:35.750
<v Speaker 5>You see how much the exploitation by government keeps us from evolving into that</v>

3158
01:35:35.751 --> 01:35:36.740
<v Speaker 5>state of greater technology.</v>

3159
01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:38.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean even even like,</v>

3160
01:35:38.570 --> 01:35:41.630
<v Speaker 5>why do we not have self driving cars right now?</v>

3161
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:46.520
<v Speaker 5>Because why do we not have twenties of the technological era?</v>

3162
01:35:46.521 --> 01:35:47.370
<v Speaker 5>This is the last,</v>

3163
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:49.280
<v Speaker 5>but it's still holding us back.</v>

3164
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.550
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3165
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:50.310
<v Speaker 5>it's still going.</v>

3166
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:51.270
<v Speaker 5>It's still holding us know,</v>

3167
01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:52.580
<v Speaker 5>incredible romantic.</v>

3168
01:35:52.610 --> 01:35:56.420
<v Speaker 5>To be able to hear the rumble of a v eight step on the gas when you want to</v>

3169
01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:58.820
<v Speaker 5>instead of just being trapped in a fucking grid,</v>

3170
01:35:58.821 --> 01:36:00.260
<v Speaker 5>like your own little trolley car.</v>

3171
01:36:00.650 --> 01:36:02.060
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you want to have a little passion.</v>

3172
01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:02.350
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

3173
01:36:02.350 --> 01:36:03.860
<v Speaker 5>I fucking car.</v>

3174
01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:07.550
<v Speaker 5>I can't fucking believe there are so many god damn liberal status here in</v>

3175
01:36:07.551 --> 01:36:11.780
<v Speaker 5>southern California when all around them they are wasting hours and hours and</v>

3176
01:36:11.781 --> 01:36:12.614
<v Speaker 5>hours of their day.</v>

3177
01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:13.090
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3178
01:36:13.090 --> 01:36:13.400
<v Speaker 5>I get.</v>

3179
01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.440
<v Speaker 5>I guess it's because they sit there and they listened to propaganda,</v>

3180
01:36:15.441 --> 01:36:19.580
<v Speaker 5>npr and their communities in their cars and they don't do about it.</v>

3181
01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:20.130
<v Speaker 5>Geez.</v>

3182
01:36:20.130 --> 01:36:24.800
<v Speaker 5>maybe having the government managed transportation resources isn't a good idea.</v>

3183
01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:25.281
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3184
01:36:25.281 --> 01:36:26.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's what they're thinking.</v>

3185
01:36:26.361 --> 01:36:26.691
<v Speaker 5>They're thinking,</v>

3186
01:36:26.691 --> 01:36:27.890
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck did I get to work?</v>

3187
01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:28.071
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3188
01:36:28.071 --> 01:36:30.530
<v Speaker 5>it's because their propaganda is the whole time they're in the car to begin</v>

3189
01:36:30.531 --> 01:36:30.760
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>

3190
01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:31.280
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3191
01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:33.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's necessarily what their problem is.</v>

3192
01:36:33.261 --> 01:36:34.520
<v Speaker 5>Their problem is they have to work.</v>

3193
01:36:34.670 --> 01:36:37.580
<v Speaker 5>The problem is that they have to have a job and if you have to be in fucking</v>

3194
01:36:37.581 --> 01:36:39.140
<v Speaker 5>santa monica at 9:00 in the morning,</v>

3195
01:36:39.141 --> 01:36:40.180
<v Speaker 5>there's only one way to do it.</v>

3196
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:42.440
<v Speaker 5>Another way of looking at what we're doing,</v>

3197
01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:42.740
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3198
01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:45.370
<v Speaker 5>but that's not necessarily designed by the government to keep you stupid.</v>

3199
01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:47.720
<v Speaker 5>That's just we have the resource.</v>

3200
01:36:47.721 --> 01:36:48.650
<v Speaker 5>We have too many god damn.</v>

3201
01:36:48.651 --> 01:36:50.630
<v Speaker 5>People know this is a side effect of government though.</v>

3202
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:54.060
<v Speaker 5>What's a side effect of them being incompetent race and that you have the,</v>

3203
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:57.080
<v Speaker 5>the through the system of concentrations of wealth and power,</v>

3204
01:36:57.081 --> 01:37:00.850
<v Speaker 5>you have unnatural incentives to live in concentrated population areas and if</v>

3205
01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:03.500
<v Speaker 5>anything la is still relatively spread out.</v>

3206
01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:07.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean compared to certain cities or in asia,</v>

3207
01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:11.240
<v Speaker 5>I think they said vancouver is the most densely populated city in the,</v>

3208
01:37:11.241 --> 01:37:12.170
<v Speaker 5>in this continent,</v>

3209
01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:13.850
<v Speaker 5>which I thought was really fascinating.</v>

3210
01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:15.740
<v Speaker 5>I would've never thought that it was that crowded,</v>

3211
01:37:15.741 --> 01:37:19.400
<v Speaker 5>but I guess it's smaller and it's got a high population,</v>

3212
01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:22.360
<v Speaker 5>but like there's areas of vancouver that are most densely I would've thought in</v>

3213
01:37:22.361 --> 01:37:25.580
<v Speaker 5>New York for sure when you have thought that it was New York would be more</v>

3214
01:37:25.581 --> 01:37:26.370
<v Speaker 5>densely populated.</v>

3215
01:37:26.370 --> 01:37:27.710
<v Speaker 5>Central park In the middle still.</v>

3216
01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:28.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3217
01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:29.473
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>

3218
01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:30.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3219
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:32.510
<v Speaker 5>It's a great place though.</v>

3220
01:37:32.530 --> 01:37:33.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3221
01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:33.973
<v Speaker 5>fascinating place.</v>

3222
01:37:34.650 --> 01:37:35.740
<v Speaker 5>It's certainly a hive of,</v>

3223
01:37:36.090 --> 01:37:37.190
<v Speaker 5>of instant energy.</v>

3224
01:37:37.191 --> 01:37:38.720
<v Speaker 5>I never want to live there,</v>

3225
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:40.430
<v Speaker 5>but it is a fun place to vIsit.</v>

3226
01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:41.270
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you.</v>

3227
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:42.500
<v Speaker 5>I've thought about spending time there.</v>

3228
01:37:42.501 --> 01:37:45.500
<v Speaker 5>I've thought about like maybe living there for like a couple months just for a</v>

3229
01:37:45.501 --> 01:37:46.660
<v Speaker 5>goof just to see what it was.</v>

3230
01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:51.230
<v Speaker 5>I think it's good to mix a mix your brain up and I almost moved there to bergen</v>

3231
01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:54.060
<v Speaker 5>girlfriend told you need to.</v>

3232
01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:55.320
<v Speaker 5>You need a friend.</v>

3233
01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:55.840
<v Speaker 5>Hey joe.</v>

3234
01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 5>He's</v>

3235
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:58.320
<v Speaker 7>someone who's going to talk to you when it comes to shit like this.</v>

3236
01:37:58.560 --> 01:37:59.670
<v Speaker 7>Can't get too crazy son.</v>

3237
01:37:59.730 --> 01:38:00.980
<v Speaker 7>I have an awesome app.</v>

3238
01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:03.450
<v Speaker 7>I have an awesome new app that's going to blow your mind.</v>

3239
01:38:03.451 --> 01:38:03.711
<v Speaker 7>It's gonna.</v>

3240
01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:05.250
<v Speaker 7>Make it kind of freak out a little.</v>

3241
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:05.840
<v Speaker 7>But what does that.</v>

3242
01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:09.360
<v Speaker 7>It's a program called crime map and you could download on your iphone.</v>

3243
01:38:09.361 --> 01:38:13.560
<v Speaker 7>I'm not sure if android or not and it uses gps to tell you where you're out on</v>

3244
01:38:13.561 --> 01:38:13.670
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

3245
01:38:13.670 --> 01:38:13.890
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3246
01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:14.723
<v Speaker 7>uses the map,</v>

3247
01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:17.930
<v Speaker 7>but that tells you all the crimes around that that had,</v>

3248
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:21.090
<v Speaker 7>has happened within the one day.</v>

3249
01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:22.800
<v Speaker 7>Like they're just where I live.</v>

3250
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:24.140
<v Speaker 7>There's like burger lee.</v>

3251
01:38:24.150 --> 01:38:24.540
<v Speaker 7>There's,</v>

3252
01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:26.030
<v Speaker 7>there's been like assaults.</v>

3253
01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:26.671
<v Speaker 7>There's been,</v>

3254
01:38:26.671 --> 01:38:27.000
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3255
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.080
<v Speaker 7>home invasions.</v>

3256
01:38:28.081 --> 01:38:28.914
<v Speaker 7>There's like in it,</v>

3257
01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:30.660
<v Speaker 7>it will freak you the fuck.</v>

3258
01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:31.920
<v Speaker 7>It was all just andy dick,</v>

3259
01:38:33.050 --> 01:38:33.410
<v Speaker 7>but like,</v>

3260
01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:33.930
<v Speaker 7>look at it.</v>

3261
01:38:33.930 --> 01:38:34.260
<v Speaker 7>Here's,</v>

3262
01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:37.950
<v Speaker 7>here's an example of where we're at right now at the ice house and you can see</v>

3263
01:38:37.951 --> 01:38:40.590
<v Speaker 7>that there's been car accIdents and crimes.</v>

3264
01:38:40.591 --> 01:38:41.910
<v Speaker 7>There's been one mugging,</v>

3265
01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:43.350
<v Speaker 7>it looks like a.</v>

3266
01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:45.690
<v Speaker 7>And it will show it if you just zoom out,</v>

3267
01:38:45.691 --> 01:38:45.840
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

3268
01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:46.170
<v Speaker 7>just like,</v>

3269
01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:46.741
<v Speaker 7>look at this.</v>

3270
01:38:46.741 --> 01:38:47.880
<v Speaker 7>This is going to freak you out though,</v>

3271
01:38:48.110 --> 01:38:50.970
<v Speaker 7>like just for a pasadena,</v>

3272
01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:51.600
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3273
01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:52.440
<v Speaker 7>yesterday.</v>

3274
01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:53.250
<v Speaker 7>Just like,</v>

3275
01:38:53.250 --> 01:38:54.900
<v Speaker 7>look how much fucking crying</v>

3276
01:38:56.730 --> 01:38:57.570
<v Speaker 7>in my car.</v>

3277
01:38:57.571 --> 01:38:58.590
<v Speaker 7>Accidents and,</v>

3278
01:38:58.620 --> 01:38:59.453
<v Speaker 7>and shit like that.</v>

3279
01:38:59.970 --> 01:39:00.630
<v Speaker 7>It will.</v>

3280
01:39:00.630 --> 01:39:02.760
<v Speaker 7>And it's cool to do it at your house though because then you're like,</v>

3281
01:39:02.761 --> 01:39:03.630
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck happened?</v>

3282
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.240
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

3283
01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:07.660
<v Speaker 2>I think something like this goes back to this problem that I have with the human</v>

3284
01:39:07.661 --> 01:39:10.150
<v Speaker 2>body in this technological society.</v>

3285
01:39:10.151 --> 01:39:13.360
<v Speaker 2>It's not capable of keeping up with everything.</v>

3286
01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:16.600
<v Speaker 2>There's too much shit coming at you and it's too much shit coming at you that</v>

3287
01:39:16.601 --> 01:39:17.890
<v Speaker 2>you really don't need to know about.</v>

3288
01:39:18.130 --> 01:39:18.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3289
01:39:18.610 --> 01:39:22.420
<v Speaker 2>maybe you should know that there'd been a 150 different car accidents in</v>

3290
01:39:22.421 --> 01:39:23.254
<v Speaker 2>pasedena,</v>

3291
01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:25.180
<v Speaker 2>but that is going to fuck with your head man.</v>

3292
01:39:25.330 --> 01:39:25.601
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3293
01:39:25.601 --> 01:39:25.810
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

3294
01:39:25.810 --> 01:39:27.300
<v Speaker 2>when there's such a thing as rational.</v>

3295
01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:27.700
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

3296
01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:30.970
<v Speaker 2>you should be dealing with your life and your reality right now,</v>

3297
01:39:30.971 --> 01:39:35.050
<v Speaker 2>but instead you're dealing with realities hundreds of yards away,</v>

3298
01:39:35.051 --> 01:39:35.980
<v Speaker 2>a mile away,</v>

3299
01:39:36.010 --> 01:39:39.700
<v Speaker 2>but all six miles away and all these realities are interfering into your</v>

3300
01:39:39.701 --> 01:39:40.180
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

3301
01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:43.120
<v Speaker 2>but also wouldn't you like to know just for safety reasons,</v>

3302
01:39:43.121 --> 01:39:44.260
<v Speaker 2>like be able to check your house and be like,</v>

3303
01:39:44.290 --> 01:39:44.681
<v Speaker 2>holy shit,</v>

3304
01:39:44.681 --> 01:39:47.080
<v Speaker 2>there's been seven home invasions in the last two weeks.</v>

3305
01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:48.370
<v Speaker 2>I need to up my shit here.</v>

3306
01:39:48.490 --> 01:39:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

3307
01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:49.391
<v Speaker 2>get the most.</v>

3308
01:39:49.391 --> 01:39:49.751
<v Speaker 2>Certainly.</v>

3309
01:39:49.751 --> 01:39:49.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3310
01:39:49.961 --> 01:39:50.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3311
01:39:50.170 --> 01:39:50.831
<v Speaker 2>you got a good point.</v>

3312
01:39:50.831 --> 01:39:51.521
<v Speaker 2>No doubt about it.</v>

3313
01:39:51.521 --> 01:39:54.550
<v Speaker 2>All I'm saying is it's just weird that we have this ancient brain,</v>

3314
01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:55.990
<v Speaker 2>certainly a good quad.</v>

3315
01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:58.870
<v Speaker 2>I certainly prefer to be able to access information than not,</v>

3316
01:39:59.040 --> 01:39:59.461
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

3317
01:39:59.461 --> 01:40:04.461
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird brain that we have where we essentially have the same mind of</v>

3318
01:40:04.481 --> 01:40:06.040
<v Speaker 2>people that lived in the past.</v>

3319
01:40:06.041 --> 01:40:08.950
<v Speaker 2>When you write things down on animal skins,</v>

3320
01:40:09.190 --> 01:40:11.110
<v Speaker 2>those dudes we find like their parchments,</v>

3321
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:13.480
<v Speaker 2>their brands are exactly the same as ours,</v>

3322
01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:16.930
<v Speaker 2>but when they find like 2000 year old documents or thousand year old,</v>

3323
01:40:16.970 --> 01:40:17.800
<v Speaker 2>holy shit,</v>

3324
01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:18.041
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

3325
01:40:18.041 --> 01:40:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Their brains were exactly like ours.</v>

3326
01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:22.830
<v Speaker 2>But think of how much more shit is in our,</v>

3327
01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:23.810
<v Speaker 2>but we're also not</v>

3328
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:24.451
<v Speaker 7>remember.</v>

3329
01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:29.330
<v Speaker 7>We don't know how to fucking skin a fucking go and use the skin as a brawl or.</v>

3330
01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:30.173
<v Speaker 7>THat's true too.</v>

3331
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:32.850
<v Speaker 7>So it took stuff away that we don't have to use it.</v>

3332
01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:33.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3333
01:40:33.171 --> 01:40:33.651
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

3334
01:40:33.651 --> 01:40:34.730
<v Speaker 2>the access to information,</v>

3335
01:40:35.250 --> 01:40:36.160
<v Speaker 2>access to information,</v>

3336
01:40:36.170 --> 01:40:40.460
<v Speaker 2>you're finding out about things that are happening in Pakistan and Syria and</v>

3337
01:40:40.461 --> 01:40:45.461
<v Speaker 2>Japan is a nuclear problem and what's going on in Russia and chechen and the</v>

3338
01:40:46.131 --> 01:40:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Philippines and there's an earthquake and Thailand and this shit is coming at</v>

3339
01:40:49.671 --> 01:40:52.370
<v Speaker 2>you all day every day.</v>

3340
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:53.710
<v Speaker 2>If you get twitter,</v>

3341
01:40:53.711 --> 01:40:55.300
<v Speaker 2>if you get on cnn.com,</v>

3342
01:40:55.301 --> 01:40:56.880
<v Speaker 2>if you go and access the new sites,</v>

3343
01:40:57.140 --> 01:41:01.210
<v Speaker 2>you are constantly inundated by actions and things that are happening that</v>

3344
01:41:01.211 --> 01:41:02.860
<v Speaker 2>literally have nothing to do with you,</v>

3345
01:41:03.010 --> 01:41:07.360
<v Speaker 2>but it's a constant barrage of them because you were in contact with essentially</v>

3346
01:41:07.450 --> 01:41:11.590
<v Speaker 2>billions of people and all the information that they project out there and to</v>

3347
01:41:11.591 --> 01:41:16.591
<v Speaker 2>the internet and it's our little shitty brains are not meant to have that much</v>

3348
01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.040
<v Speaker 2>information coming at us.</v>

3349
01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:23.160
<v Speaker 2>We still hAve this tribal body that wants to move around and find animals and</v>

3350
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:28.830
<v Speaker 2>grow vegetables and this is the same fucking body and this body is getting</v>

3351
01:41:28.930 --> 01:41:33.930
<v Speaker 2>youtube videos and fucking all kinds of crazy information coming out at all day,</v>

3352
01:41:34.421 --> 01:41:35.500
<v Speaker 2>24 hours a day.</v>

3353
01:41:35.650 --> 01:41:40.120
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we're standing in the middle of a river and we just trying to</v>

3354
01:41:40.121 --> 01:41:41.080
<v Speaker 2>hold out of the water.</v>

3355
01:41:41.081 --> 01:41:42.250
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like it's too much.</v>

3356
01:41:42.251 --> 01:41:46.540
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like for every one person there's way too much information that you</v>

3357
01:41:46.541 --> 01:41:48.220
<v Speaker 2>have to absorb about everything.</v>

3358
01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:51.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like to even focus on one thing.</v>

3359
01:41:51.281 --> 01:41:54.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like you could give your whole life to politics.</v>

3360
01:41:54.930 --> 01:41:58.840
<v Speaker 2>You have your whole life to observing politics and still barely have a grasp on</v>

3361
01:41:58.841 --> 01:42:00.040
<v Speaker 2>everything that's going on.</v>

3362
01:42:00.190 --> 01:42:03.730
<v Speaker 2>All the sneaky little fucking underhanded deals that are taking place all over</v>

3363
01:42:03.731 --> 01:42:04.120
<v Speaker 2>the place.</v>

3364
01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:05.560
<v Speaker 2>How could you possibly manage them?</v>

3365
01:42:05.650 --> 01:42:07.450
<v Speaker 2>How could you possibly even researched them?</v>

3366
01:42:07.451 --> 01:42:11.440
<v Speaker 2>How can you possibly even read all the documents that have been transcribed,</v>

3367
01:42:11.441 --> 01:42:12.400
<v Speaker 2>but every different case?</v>

3368
01:42:12.401 --> 01:42:13.460
<v Speaker 2>You can't do it.</v>

3369
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:16.120
<v Speaker 2>It's insanity to people passing the laws.</v>

3370
01:42:16.121 --> 01:42:16.954
<v Speaker 2>don't even read them.</v>

3371
01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Let's wait.</v>

3372
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:20.800
<v Speaker 2>While and I was talking about before about we're all apart of something,</v>

3373
01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:21.940
<v Speaker 2>we all have our,</v>

3374
01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:26.620
<v Speaker 2>a part of this weird fucking machine of humanity and some people,</v>

3375
01:42:26.621 --> 01:42:29.140
<v Speaker 2>their part is to figure out how to make an alienware computer.</v>

3376
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Your part is to rile people up on the internet and I don't know what the fuck my</v>

3377
01:42:32.951 --> 01:42:33.784
<v Speaker 2>part is,</v>

3378
01:42:33.850 --> 01:42:35.650
<v Speaker 2>but everybody has a piece that,</v>

3379
01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:36.533
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3380
01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.160
<v Speaker 2>we're making cars.</v>

3381
01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:39.100
<v Speaker 2>They have art.</v>

3382
01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Are</v>

3383
01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:41.950
<v Speaker 5>you get people passIonate because you are passionate because you care and you,</v>

3384
01:42:41.951 --> 01:42:42.211
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3385
01:42:42.211 --> 01:42:43.200
<v Speaker 5>you understand what the silver.</v>

3386
01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:46.260
<v Speaker 5>Let me go back to what brian said because he said something really profound</v>

3387
01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:48.130
<v Speaker 5>about possible.</v>

3388
01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:50.570
<v Speaker 5>You just woke up the dry.</v>

3389
01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:52.400
<v Speaker 5>We'll go up the drag.</v>

3390
01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:53.220
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3391
01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:57.450
<v Speaker 5>because what you said about every development like taking away a part of,</v>

3392
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:59.250
<v Speaker 5>of what it is to be human being.</v>

3393
01:42:59.251 --> 01:42:59.521
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

3394
01:42:59.521 --> 01:43:03.690
<v Speaker 5>and I remember just well what it used to be to be a human being like hunting and</v>

3395
01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:06.720
<v Speaker 5>trapping and fishing and living off the land.</v>

3396
01:43:06.721 --> 01:43:07.770
<v Speaker 5>Growing your own vegetables,</v>

3397
01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:09.390
<v Speaker 5>knowing what to eat when you're sick.</v>

3398
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:10.141
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3399
01:43:10.141 --> 01:43:10.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's,</v>

3400
01:43:10.890 --> 01:43:11.723
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

3401
01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.010
<v Speaker 5>it's almost impossible to do that now.</v>

3402
01:43:14.011 --> 01:43:15.540
<v Speaker 5>Try try to fucking living off the land.</v>

3403
01:43:15.570 --> 01:43:20.570
<v Speaker 5>Good luck is that some way evolutionary and you can't hold a job and live off</v>

3404
01:43:22.651 --> 01:43:23.490
<v Speaker 5>the land the same time,</v>

3405
01:43:23.610 --> 01:43:28.610
<v Speaker 5>but I can explain this actually through my last dmt experience.</v>

3406
01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:29.903
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3407
01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:30.953
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

3408
01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:32.310
<v Speaker 5>Which is really interesting because I.</v>

3409
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:36.660
<v Speaker 5>I've been posting my dmt experiences on my youtube channel and I've good way to</v>

3410
01:43:36.661 --> 01:43:37.370
<v Speaker 5>get arrested.</v>

3411
01:43:37.370 --> 01:43:41.520
<v Speaker 5>I've had three sessions of interested enough times that they're not going to</v>

3412
01:43:41.521 --> 01:43:42.390
<v Speaker 5>come after me for that.</v>

3413
01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:44.190
<v Speaker 5>I've had.</v>

3414
01:43:44.190 --> 01:43:49.190
<v Speaker 5>I've had three sessions and every time I've smoked twice and this last time has</v>

3415
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:51.360
<v Speaker 5>been exponentially more complex.</v>

3416
01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:52.220
<v Speaker 5>The first</v>

3417
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:57.140
<v Speaker 4>time started with a blob of psychedelic colors.</v>

3418
01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:02.480
<v Speaker 4>The second time it had a bit of a female personality and a bit of a form to it,</v>

3419
01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:03.770
<v Speaker 4>but not much more.</v>

3420
01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:09.340
<v Speaker 4>The third time I saw building structures and scenery type stuff and the fourth</v>

3421
01:44:10.821 --> 01:44:15.821
<v Speaker 4>time I saw what I described as my face being raped with the truth of the</v>

3422
01:44:15.831 --> 01:44:20.210
<v Speaker 4>universe and it was this complex vision and the last time,</v>

3423
01:44:20.211 --> 01:44:25.211
<v Speaker 4>the third time in the first launch I saw a pattern of like colored bricks moving</v>

3424
01:44:27.621 --> 01:44:27.981
<v Speaker 4>at me,</v>

3425
01:44:27.981 --> 01:44:31.210
<v Speaker 4>unfolding in different ways and going through different color shifts and showing</v>

3426
01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:31.701
<v Speaker 4>different shapes.</v>

3427
01:44:31.701 --> 01:44:32.810
<v Speaker 4>And it was like,</v>

3428
01:44:32.811 --> 01:44:33.081
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

3429
01:44:33.081 --> 01:44:35.570
<v Speaker 4>now it's really complex and trying to show me something.</v>

3430
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:37.430
<v Speaker 4>And then I did another rip.</v>

3431
01:44:37.431 --> 01:44:37.701
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3432
01:44:37.701 --> 01:44:41.080
<v Speaker 4>Then as soon as I came out of that one and I spent half the time laughing.</v>

3433
01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:42.890
<v Speaker 4>It was just a beautiful experience,</v>

3434
01:44:42.891 --> 01:44:45.800
<v Speaker 4>but I couldn't even describe the whole thing and I was videotaping it.</v>

3435
01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:49.340
<v Speaker 4>So I tried afterwards to talk to the camera and describe everything I did and</v>

3436
01:44:49.341 --> 01:44:54.050
<v Speaker 4>this one we actually as we speak and versus the dmt part two and two point one</v>

3437
01:44:54.051 --> 01:44:56.450
<v Speaker 4>or uploading with disclaimers on them.</v>

3438
01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:57.930
<v Speaker 4>And then part three is,</v>

3439
01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:00.440
<v Speaker 4>is in the can and I'm going to be editing and it soon.</v>

3440
01:45:00.441 --> 01:45:01.220
<v Speaker 4>But that,</v>

3441
01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:05.570
<v Speaker 4>that second trip and the third time was just overwhelming.</v>

3442
01:45:05.571 --> 01:45:09.860
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't even describe it and it was so much coming at me and and and in</v>

3443
01:45:09.861 --> 01:45:11.990
<v Speaker 4>different forms and in different colors and different shapes,</v>

3444
01:45:12.230 --> 01:45:14.420
<v Speaker 4>but what I experienced in the middle of that,</v>

3445
01:45:14.421 --> 01:45:19.421
<v Speaker 4>that was the just had me laughing with joy the entire time was inexperience of</v>

3446
01:45:19.911 --> 01:45:24.911
<v Speaker 4>the pure human will and at first it was like a vision of a brain floating in a</v>

3447
01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:28.250
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic space,</v>

3448
01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:28.880
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3449
01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:32.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know how to describe it and I'm sure you.</v>

3450
01:45:32.150 --> 01:45:33.350
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm talking about though,</v>

3451
01:45:33.351 --> 01:45:37.490
<v Speaker 4>where you're in that space space listening this experience,</v>

3452
01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:38.800
<v Speaker 4>and then I.</v>

3453
01:45:38.810 --> 01:45:42.820
<v Speaker 4>Then it wasn't the brain and then it was my consciousness and you.</v>

3454
01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:47.270
<v Speaker 4>You realize that your consciousness is separate from your brain and that it's</v>

3455
01:45:47.271 --> 01:45:48.830
<v Speaker 4>still a product of your biology,</v>

3456
01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:53.180
<v Speaker 4>but that there was something in the middle of it that is the human will that is</v>

3457
01:45:53.181 --> 01:45:54.014
<v Speaker 4>distinct.</v>

3458
01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:56.420
<v Speaker 4>That is who we are.</v>

3459
01:45:56.421 --> 01:45:57.470
<v Speaker 4>Because if you think about it,</v>

3460
01:45:57.740 --> 01:45:58.550
<v Speaker 4>we're not.</v>

3461
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:59.870
<v Speaker 4>PartIcles were waves.</v>

3462
01:45:59.871 --> 01:46:04.550
<v Speaker 4>You know what defines us is not our matter that is recycled every seven years or</v>

3463
01:46:04.551 --> 01:46:06.860
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is that all your cells are replaced in your body.</v>

3464
01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:08.360
<v Speaker 4>You are a wave of energy.</v>

3465
01:46:08.361 --> 01:46:10.340
<v Speaker 4>Everything that gives you identity as a human being,</v>

3466
01:46:10.341 --> 01:46:14.240
<v Speaker 4>as as an entity is a wave and and what I experienced and what do you mean by a</v>

3467
01:46:14.241 --> 01:46:15.074
<v Speaker 4>wave?</v>

3468
01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:15.891
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3469
01:46:15.891 --> 01:46:16.760
<v Speaker 4>what gives you form?</v>

3470
01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:17.151
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

3471
01:46:17.151 --> 01:46:17.961
<v Speaker 4>It's not your body,</v>

3472
01:46:17.961 --> 01:46:19.340
<v Speaker 4>it's not the material of your body.</v>

3473
01:46:19.341 --> 01:46:20.630
<v Speaker 4>it's the course of your life,</v>

3474
01:46:20.650 --> 01:46:22.400
<v Speaker 4>the the person that you were as a baby,</v>

3475
01:46:22.401 --> 01:46:26.440
<v Speaker 4>the body that you were seven years later did not have a single molecule in it</v>

3476
01:46:26.450 --> 01:46:29.160
<v Speaker 4>that was in it when you were born and every seven years your,</v>

3477
01:46:29.161 --> 01:46:32.610
<v Speaker 4>your entire body is replaced and all matter can be analyzed.</v>

3478
01:46:32.611 --> 01:46:33.380
<v Speaker 4>Your neurons,</v>

3479
01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:33.711
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3480
01:46:33.711 --> 01:46:34.544
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3481
01:46:34.690 --> 01:46:36.010
<v Speaker 4>we even then they're there.</v>

3482
01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:38.540
<v Speaker 4>The molecules are cycled out.</v>

3483
01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:39.950
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>

3484
01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:40.933
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a physicist.</v>

3485
01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:42.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't care about the details of that.</v>

3486
01:46:42.570 --> 01:46:44.130
<v Speaker 4>Thinking about life.</v>

3487
01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:46.270
<v Speaker 4>That's why neurodegenerative the cell.</v>

3488
01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:47.300
<v Speaker 4>So the cell structures,</v>

3489
01:46:47.301 --> 01:46:48.770
<v Speaker 4>you do absolutely heal from them,</v>

3490
01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 4>but all of the matter</v>

3491
01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:51.270
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

3492
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:52.200
<v Speaker 5>is recycled.</v>

3493
01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:55.680
<v Speaker 5>Although if you go down to the son,</v>

3494
01:46:55.890 --> 01:46:57.360
<v Speaker 5>the son molecular level,</v>

3495
01:46:57.630 --> 01:46:57.871
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3496
01:46:57.871 --> 01:47:00.150
<v Speaker 5>everything can be analyzed as a particle or a wave and anything.</v>

3497
01:47:00.210 --> 01:47:02.850
<v Speaker 5>I just was trying to figure out like if you know how to,</v>

3498
01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:03.893
<v Speaker 5>what's the,</v>

3499
01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:04.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3500
01:47:04.490 --> 01:47:07.410
<v Speaker 5>w w what's the best way for someone to try to wrap their head around?</v>

3501
01:47:07.411 --> 01:47:07.590
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

3502
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:08.430
<v Speaker 5>what you mean by that?</v>

3503
01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:09.170
<v Speaker 5>Because when I,</v>

3504
01:47:09.170 --> 01:47:10.620
<v Speaker 5>I kind of don't understand what you're saying,</v>

3505
01:47:10.621 --> 01:47:11.670
<v Speaker 5>but when you say you're not a particle,</v>

3506
01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:12.513
<v Speaker 5>your wave,</v>

3507
01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:14.700
<v Speaker 5>what exactly do you mean by that?</v>

3508
01:47:14.730 --> 01:47:14.911
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3509
01:47:14.911 --> 01:47:15.744
<v Speaker 5>what are you,</v>

3510
01:47:16.410 --> 01:47:17.310
<v Speaker 5>what defines you?</v>

3511
01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:18.280
<v Speaker 5>What devices?</v>

3512
01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:19.620
<v Speaker 5>And this isn't a question of physics,</v>

3513
01:47:19.621 --> 01:47:20.760
<v Speaker 5>this is a question of philosophy.</v>

3514
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:21.750
<v Speaker 5>What defInes you,</v>

3515
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:22.231
<v Speaker 5>joe rogan,</v>

3516
01:47:22.231 --> 01:47:23.064
<v Speaker 5>who are you?</v>

3517
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:25.840
<v Speaker 5>I'm just this dude that gets to say what joe rogan does.</v>

3518
01:47:25.841 --> 01:47:27.360
<v Speaker 5>So what are you the matter in your body?</v>

3519
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:28.111
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3520
01:47:28.111 --> 01:47:29.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm certainly in my consciousness,</v>

3521
01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:30.413
<v Speaker 5>my choices.</v>

3522
01:47:30.630 --> 01:47:32.220
<v Speaker 5>So are you the thoughts in your brain?</v>

3523
01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:37.520
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine that you are wherever the thoughts resonate from whether or not</v>

3524
01:47:38.581 --> 01:47:42.480
<v Speaker 5>it really is in your brain or whether it's in every aspect of your body.</v>

3525
01:47:42.481 --> 01:47:43.920
<v Speaker 5>It's just your Brain projects it,</v>

3526
01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:46.650
<v Speaker 5>whether or not it's even the brain that projection with him to the brain tunes</v>

3527
01:47:46.651 --> 01:47:47.070
<v Speaker 5>it in,</v>

3528
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:49.140
<v Speaker 5>whether it's like a frequency and use.</v>

3529
01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:50.820
<v Speaker 5>Use this body as a vehicle.</v>

3530
01:47:51.110 --> 01:47:53.310
<v Speaker 5>There's people that believe that I don't know,</v>

3531
01:47:53.690 --> 01:47:56.230
<v Speaker 5>but that's what I experienced what I experienced in my last dmt.</v>

3532
01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:57.450
<v Speaker 5>But you were high as fuck.</v>

3533
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:58.000
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

3534
01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:58.260
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

3535
01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:00.540
<v Speaker 5>You got to always remember you were high as fuck.</v>

3536
01:48:00.690 --> 01:48:03.090
<v Speaker 5>Whenever someone tells me like they had a psychedelic experience,</v>

3537
01:48:03.091 --> 01:48:03.361
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

3538
01:48:03.361 --> 01:48:03.511
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3539
01:48:03.511 --> 01:48:04.344
<v Speaker 5>I've had a lot of them.</v>

3540
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:05.520
<v Speaker 5>They've changed my life.</v>

3541
01:48:05.521 --> 01:48:06.331
<v Speaker 5>They're beautiful.</v>

3542
01:48:06.331 --> 01:48:08.640
<v Speaker 5>They're amazing with whatever that comes out of it,</v>

3543
01:48:08.641 --> 01:48:12.090
<v Speaker 5>but you always have to open the door to the possibility that you were just high</v>

3544
01:48:12.091 --> 01:48:15.210
<v Speaker 5>as fuck and this is some shit that you might've already known anyway,</v>

3545
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:19.770
<v Speaker 5>so I don't know whether or not you're really communicating with somebody.</v>

3546
01:48:19.770 --> 01:48:20.760
<v Speaker 5>When you do damn tay,</v>

3547
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:21.550
<v Speaker 5>it seems.</v>

3548
01:48:21.550 --> 01:48:21.701
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3549
01:48:21.701 --> 01:48:22.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe.</v>

3550
01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:22.351
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3551
01:48:22.351 --> 01:48:23.460
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe in any of that shit.</v>

3552
01:48:23.461 --> 01:48:25.590
<v Speaker 5>I don't know my baby man.</v>

3553
01:48:25.591 --> 01:48:26.600
<v Speaker 5>It might be lifeforms.</v>

3554
01:48:26.690 --> 01:48:30.420
<v Speaker 5>It does something to your brain and learn something to yourself and things are</v>

3555
01:48:30.421 --> 01:48:33.180
<v Speaker 5>exposed to your consciousness that wouldn't be otherwise.</v>

3556
01:48:33.181 --> 01:48:34.530
<v Speaker 5>I think that's really important that,</v>

3557
01:48:34.531 --> 01:48:37.390
<v Speaker 5>but it also could be some sort of a chemical doorway to another dementia.</v>

3558
01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:39.120
<v Speaker 5>Communication by</v>

3559
01:48:40.770 --> 01:48:44.040
<v Speaker 5>the evidence is that dimethyltryptamine is something they believe your body</v>

3560
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:47.040
<v Speaker 5>produces when you're in periods of extreme stress or when your body thinks it's</v>

3561
01:48:47.041 --> 01:48:50.070
<v Speaker 5>going to die and if you follow all the different</v>

3562
01:48:51.570 --> 01:48:53.340
<v Speaker 5>myths and different cultures,</v>

3563
01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:55.050
<v Speaker 5>beliefs in the afterlife,</v>

3564
01:48:55.410 --> 01:49:00.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean so many of them involve going towards the light and these crazy visions</v>

3565
01:49:00.721 --> 01:49:04.590
<v Speaker 5>and what those are probably or near death experiences because your brain is</v>

3566
01:49:04.591 --> 01:49:08.160
<v Speaker 5>tripping out on dmp and that's a much more rational,</v>

3567
01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:11.070
<v Speaker 5>very well be real that we think of.</v>

3568
01:49:11.190 --> 01:49:14.110
<v Speaker 5>We oNly think of ourselves as real because we can make noise,</v>

3569
01:49:14.300 --> 01:49:14.910
<v Speaker 5>can hit you.</v>

3570
01:49:14.910 --> 01:49:19.770
<v Speaker 5>You can feel away from physics that 99 percent of this is empty space.</v>

3571
01:49:20.190 --> 01:49:20.461
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3572
01:49:20.461 --> 01:49:20.880
<v Speaker 5>we don't.</v>

3573
01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:21.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3574
01:49:21.390 --> 01:49:21.691
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3575
01:49:21.691 --> 01:49:23.670
<v Speaker 5>Well that's certainly a part of the problem.</v>

3576
01:49:23.970 --> 01:49:26.760
<v Speaker 5>We don't necessarily know what the fuck is really going on here.</v>

3577
01:49:27.330 --> 01:49:28.163
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3578
01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:30.570
<v Speaker 5>this thing really might be a simulation,</v>

3579
01:49:31.050 --> 01:49:33.390
<v Speaker 5>but this is the science behind that.</v>

3580
01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:36.330
<v Speaker 5>This is what I experienced and this is what was profound about it to me was that</v>

3581
01:49:36.331 --> 01:49:37.164
<v Speaker 5>it was.</v>

3582
01:49:37.410 --> 01:49:39.960
<v Speaker 5>I could only describe it as pure human will and I,</v>

3583
01:49:39.961 --> 01:49:40.181
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3584
01:49:40.181 --> 01:49:41.190
<v Speaker 5>and I don't.</v>

3585
01:49:41.191 --> 01:49:43.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to say it was an out of body experience because that describes it</v>

3586
01:49:43.711 --> 01:49:43.951
<v Speaker 5>wrong,</v>

3587
01:49:43.951 --> 01:49:48.190
<v Speaker 5>but it was an experience where my consciousness was separated from the rest</v>

3588
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:49.023
<v Speaker 4>of my being.</v>

3589
01:49:49.150 --> 01:49:50.650
<v Speaker 4>That was what you took out of it.</v>

3590
01:49:50.651 --> 01:49:53.500
<v Speaker 4>You felt like that was what the experience was for me.</v>

3591
01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:53.980
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3592
01:49:53.980 --> 01:49:56.500
<v Speaker 4>And that was a very empowering experience.</v>

3593
01:49:56.690 --> 01:49:57.610
<v Speaker 4>to get back to what,</v>

3594
01:49:57.611 --> 01:49:58.030
<v Speaker 4>brian,</v>

3595
01:49:58.030 --> 01:49:58.863
<v Speaker 4>when you say lou,</v>

3596
01:49:58.930 --> 01:49:59.621
<v Speaker 4>when you say like,</v>

3597
01:49:59.621 --> 01:50:00.341
<v Speaker 4>by your being,</v>

3598
01:50:00.341 --> 01:50:01.540
<v Speaker 4>do you mean by like your,</v>

3599
01:50:01.541 --> 01:50:02.374
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

3600
01:50:02.410 --> 01:50:04.510
<v Speaker 4>your culture or your language?</v>

3601
01:50:04.511 --> 01:50:06.070
<v Speaker 4>Like you were free of all that.</v>

3602
01:50:06.190 --> 01:50:06.851
<v Speaker 4>He would just,</v>

3603
01:50:06.851 --> 01:50:06.911
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3604
01:50:06.911 --> 01:50:07.540
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

3605
01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:08.230
<v Speaker 4>Did you feel that?</v>

3606
01:50:08.230 --> 01:50:08.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3607
01:50:08.850 --> 01:50:09.180
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3608
01:50:09.180 --> 01:50:09.500
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3609
01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:10.910
<v Speaker 4>You with no context,</v>

3610
01:50:10.911 --> 01:50:11.131
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3611
01:50:11.131 --> 01:50:11.300
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3612
01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:11.560
<v Speaker 4>Comes,</v>

3613
01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:12.760
<v Speaker 4>like a singularity,</v>

3614
01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:13.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3615
01:50:13.410 --> 01:50:14.111
<v Speaker 4>and this is,</v>

3616
01:50:14.111 --> 01:50:14.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3617
01:50:14.231 --> 01:50:14.531
<v Speaker 4>it's funny.</v>

3618
01:50:14.531 --> 01:50:18.850
<v Speaker 4>This is how I think of the effect of marijuana when I smoke weed usually,</v>

3619
01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:20.280
<v Speaker 4>and it's the.</v>

3620
01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:22.360
<v Speaker 4>If your consciousness is,</v>

3621
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:23.500
<v Speaker 4>and this is a crude metaphor,</v>

3622
01:50:23.501 --> 01:50:28.501
<v Speaker 4>but a point moving around in your brain point of light say than marijuana makes</v>

3623
01:50:29.201 --> 01:50:30.430
<v Speaker 4>it a more diffuse light.</v>

3624
01:50:30.670 --> 01:50:32.500
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes that means exploring different things.</v>

3625
01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:37.500
<v Speaker 4>And I think that explains the creative legendary benefits of marijuana.</v>

3626
01:50:37.551 --> 01:50:38.170
<v Speaker 4>I agree,</v>

3627
01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:41.290
<v Speaker 4>but it also means it's sometimes harder to put sentences together.</v>

3628
01:50:41.590 --> 01:50:42.100
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3629
01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:46.290
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes it's hard to really get the idea and,</v>

3630
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:47.350
<v Speaker 4>and hold it doWn.</v>

3631
01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:47.750
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3632
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:50.950
<v Speaker 4>it's like these new doors present themselves and you have to stop and look at it</v>

3633
01:50:50.951 --> 01:50:51.784
<v Speaker 4>all and go.</v>

3634
01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:52.810
<v Speaker 4>But I'm inspired,</v>

3635
01:50:52.811 --> 01:50:53.021
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3636
01:50:53.021 --> 01:50:53.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3637
01:50:53.490 --> 01:50:53.831
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

3638
01:50:53.831 --> 01:50:57.190
<v Speaker 4>this is a really exciting thing for me to get to be on your podcast.</v>

3639
01:50:57.340 --> 01:50:57.620
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3640
01:50:57.620 --> 01:50:59.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm inspired to have you on man.</v>

3641
01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:01.150
<v Speaker 4>It's cool to hear that you enjoy the show.</v>

3642
01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:02.520
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

3643
01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:04.090
<v Speaker 4>so to what brian was saying though,</v>

3644
01:51:04.510 --> 01:51:06.490
<v Speaker 4>to what brian was saying about brian,</v>

3645
01:51:06.491 --> 01:51:07.324
<v Speaker 4>what were you saying?</v>

3646
01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:08.810
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3647
01:51:09.250 --> 01:51:11.800
<v Speaker 4>something about fucking a Jack Daniels bottle or something.</v>

3648
01:51:11.890 --> 01:51:12.191
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3649
01:51:12.191 --> 01:51:12.791
<v Speaker 4>that's what it was.</v>

3650
01:51:12.791 --> 01:51:13.510
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>

3651
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:18.340
<v Speaker 4>It was about people forget how to kill goats and shit and make bikinis out of</v>

3652
01:51:18.341 --> 01:51:18.440
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

3653
01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:20.200
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think they ever really did.</v>

3654
01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:23.890
<v Speaker 4>Historically we can see the technological singularity coming,</v>

3655
01:51:23.891 --> 01:51:24.161
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3656
01:51:24.161 --> 01:51:26.920
<v Speaker 4>We see that coming and we can see if we don't fuck it up.</v>

3657
01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:27.100
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3658
01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:30.040
<v Speaker 4>And see sooner or later we're going to have taco copters and food's going to</v>

3659
01:51:30.041 --> 01:51:34.030
<v Speaker 4>drop out of the sky for us on our cars will drive themselves or whatever the</v>

3660
01:51:34.031 --> 01:51:34.864
<v Speaker 4>case is going to be.</v>

3661
01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:36.310
<v Speaker 4>But I think that there's someone else coming,</v>

3662
01:51:36.311 --> 01:51:36.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3663
01:51:36.521 --> 01:51:37.600
<v Speaker 4>when every surface in the,</v>

3664
01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:39.430
<v Speaker 4>around us as a touch screen and,</v>

3665
01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:39.750
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3666
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:43.240
<v Speaker 4>and we just get to that level of prosperity and that's coming within our</v>

3667
01:51:43.241 --> 01:51:45.760
<v Speaker 4>lifetimes because it's happening so exponentially.</v>

3668
01:51:45.761 --> 01:51:46.690
<v Speaker 4>I see this as,</v>

3669
01:51:47.050 --> 01:51:47.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3670
01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:48.940
<v Speaker 4>who knows how long it's gonna take,</v>

3671
01:51:48.941 --> 01:51:49.751
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>

3672
01:51:49.751 --> 01:51:52.880
<v Speaker 4>an urgency for me to help humanity evolve past status,</v>

3673
01:51:52.890 --> 01:51:53.410
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3674
01:51:53.410 --> 01:51:53.850
<v Speaker 4>but will,</v>

3675
01:51:53.850 --> 01:51:58.510
<v Speaker 4>we're coming to is a state of greater experience in our day to day lives of that</v>

3676
01:51:58.511 --> 01:52:00.760
<v Speaker 4>pure human will that we're evolving to that.</v>

3677
01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:01.031
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

3678
01:52:01.031 --> 01:52:01.721
<v Speaker 4>I know this is silly,</v>

3679
01:52:01.721 --> 01:52:04.780
<v Speaker 4>but the first time I heard the term technological singularity,</v>

3680
01:52:05.410 --> 01:52:07.930
<v Speaker 4>which describes that point at which we have computer smarter than human brains,</v>

3681
01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:09.790
<v Speaker 4>is I thought,</v>

3682
01:52:09.970 --> 01:52:10.211
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3683
01:52:10.211 --> 01:52:12.700
<v Speaker 4>that's when all of our brains are plugged into the matrix.</v>

3684
01:52:12.701 --> 01:52:13.690
<v Speaker 4>And we're all this hive mind.</v>

3685
01:52:13.691 --> 01:52:15.940
<v Speaker 4>And we've all replaced every individual brain cell in our,</v>

3686
01:52:15.941 --> 01:52:17.800
<v Speaker 4>in our skulls with computer chips,</v>

3687
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:18.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3688
01:52:18.161 --> 01:52:18.530
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>

3689
01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:18.690
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3690
01:52:18.690 --> 01:52:18.941
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3691
01:52:18.941 --> 01:52:19.510
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3692
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:21.730
<v Speaker 4>but who knows what that's gonna look like,</v>

3693
01:52:21.731 --> 01:52:22.091
<v Speaker 4>but what,</v>

3694
01:52:22.091 --> 01:52:25.120
<v Speaker 4>but what we're going to experience as human beings and who knows if our waves</v>

3695
01:52:25.121 --> 01:52:26.230
<v Speaker 4>are going to ride that long,</v>

3696
01:52:26.231 --> 01:52:26.471
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3697
01:52:26.471 --> 01:52:26.940
<v Speaker 4>if they're,</v>

3698
01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:28.060
<v Speaker 4>if they're going to last that long,</v>

3699
01:52:28.061 --> 01:52:30.760
<v Speaker 4>but I think most people alive today are,</v>

3700
01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:31.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3701
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.420
<v Speaker 4>especially young people are going to live to experience this and we have a</v>

3702
01:52:34.421 --> 01:52:38.110
<v Speaker 4>special motivation than to make sure that the world that experiences this</v>

3703
01:52:38.111 --> 01:52:40.590
<v Speaker 4>technology is one that is evolved past statism,</v>

3704
01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:41.080
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3705
01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:41.913
<v Speaker 4>the design,</v>

3706
01:52:41.950 --> 01:52:43.030
<v Speaker 4>this thing of government,</v>

3707
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.540
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

3708
01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:45.560
<v Speaker 4>of imposing our will on others by of saying,</v>

3709
01:52:45.561 --> 01:52:45.741
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3710
01:52:45.741 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 4>if it's</v>

3711
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:46.701
<v Speaker 2>51 percent,</v>

3712
01:52:46.701 --> 01:52:47.534
<v Speaker 2>then it's okay.</v>

3713
01:52:47.690 --> 01:52:48.021
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3714
01:52:48.021 --> 01:52:48.211
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3715
01:52:48.211 --> 01:52:49.690
<v Speaker 2>of saying they engaging in,</v>

3716
01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:50.121
<v Speaker 2>in this,</v>

3717
01:52:50.121 --> 01:52:51.860
<v Speaker 2>this truly pathological behavior.</v>

3718
01:52:51.861 --> 01:52:53.570
<v Speaker 2>But I'm obviously very optimistic.</v>

3719
01:52:53.970 --> 01:52:54.281
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3720
01:52:54.281 --> 01:52:54.530
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3721
01:52:54.530 --> 01:52:56.450
<v Speaker 2>you are very optimistic and I hope you're right.</v>

3722
01:52:56.530 --> 01:52:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3723
01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:58.220
<v Speaker 2>you might be.</v>

3724
01:52:58.280 --> 01:52:59.091
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows?</v>

3725
01:52:59.091 --> 01:53:01.670
<v Speaker 2>I would love it if the story turned out that we all pulled it together in the</v>

3726
01:53:01.671 --> 01:53:02.091
<v Speaker 2>long run.</v>

3727
01:53:02.091 --> 01:53:03.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly disappointed by people.</v>

3728
01:53:03.831 --> 01:53:07.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly disappointed by stories when I hear about the collapse of Greece</v>

3729
01:53:07.731 --> 01:53:08.010
<v Speaker 2>and all,</v>

3730
01:53:08.010 --> 01:53:09.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly disappointed like real.</v>

3731
01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Can anybody fucking keep it together anywhere?</v>

3732
01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:13.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly disappointed.</v>

3733
01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:15.650
<v Speaker 2>Currency on that note.</v>

3734
01:53:15.710 --> 01:53:16.340
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second,</v>

3735
01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:19.190
<v Speaker 2>but then I also look at all the shit that people have accomplished.</v>

3736
01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:21.350
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck ever would've figured out how to build a bridge?</v>

3737
01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck ever figured out how to make airplanes?</v>

3738
01:53:23.710 --> 01:53:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>

3739
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.320
<v Speaker 2>how?</v>

3740
01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:25.900
<v Speaker 2>How was there a dude who really figured out,</v>

3741
01:53:25.901 --> 01:53:28.470
<v Speaker 2>I put satellites up in the air so I can watch direct tv?</v>

3742
01:53:28.610 --> 01:53:29.790
<v Speaker 2>How is that how?</v>

3743
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:31.180
<v Speaker 2>How did all that happen?</v>

3744
01:53:31.190 --> 01:53:33.050
<v Speaker 2>If and if all that happened,</v>

3745
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:36.440
<v Speaker 2>I hold out hope for the possibility that people could,</v>

3746
01:53:36.710 --> 01:53:40.760
<v Speaker 2>as much as they have achieved creatively and technologically with ingenuity,</v>

3747
01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:45.970
<v Speaker 2>could also reach the same level of excellence with their social engineering and</v>

3748
01:53:47.481 --> 01:53:51.500
<v Speaker 2>the way they treat each other and the way they develop a community and the way</v>

3749
01:53:51.501 --> 01:53:56.150
<v Speaker 2>they project the idea that it's way better to have a world where everyone is</v>

3750
01:53:56.151 --> 01:53:56.984
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>

3751
01:53:57.080 --> 01:54:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Then to have a world where a few people dominate people and we have to figure</v>

3752
01:54:01.551 --> 01:54:03.650
<v Speaker 2>out how to do it from the ground up and it's got to be,</v>

3753
01:54:03.651 --> 01:54:05.330
<v Speaker 2>you got to figure out how to raise children better.</v>

3754
01:54:05.530 --> 01:54:07.670
<v Speaker 2>You've got to figure out how to raise children better and you've got to deal</v>

3755
01:54:07.671 --> 01:54:09.290
<v Speaker 2>with children that are at that are,</v>

3756
01:54:09.291 --> 01:54:09.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3757
01:54:09.561 --> 01:54:12.260
<v Speaker 2>in foster homes and that's got to be handled way better.</v>

3758
01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:15.680
<v Speaker 2>You have to look at human beings as resources and potential problems if they're</v>

3759
01:54:15.681 --> 01:54:16.420
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

3760
01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:17.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3761
01:54:17.410 --> 01:54:20.360
<v Speaker 2>the last thing anybody wants to do is grow up through life.</v>

3762
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Just constantly dealing with a fucked up childhood.</v>

3763
01:54:23.150 --> 01:54:28.150
<v Speaker 2>I have so many friends That were abused as children and they are constantly in</v>

3764
01:54:28.251 --> 01:54:30.290
<v Speaker 2>battle with this well into their thirties,</v>

3765
01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:33.080
<v Speaker 2>constantly at battle with their childhood.</v>

3766
01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:33.801
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3767
01:54:33.801 --> 01:54:36.470
<v Speaker 2>and that's because people raising kids,</v>

3768
01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:37.460
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

3769
01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:38.960
<v Speaker 2>they just do it their way.</v>

3770
01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:43.160
<v Speaker 2>It's the Most important resource that we have as human beings.</v>

3771
01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:45.410
<v Speaker 2>And we used to have a whole fucking community.</v>

3772
01:54:45.411 --> 01:54:47.690
<v Speaker 2>We used to have tribes of us 50,</v>

3773
01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:49.550
<v Speaker 2>60 monkey people and we all fucked each other.</v>

3774
01:54:49.551 --> 01:54:52.880
<v Speaker 2>So nobody knew who the real daddy was anyway and they are raising these babies</v>

3775
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:54.180
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

3776
01:54:54.210 --> 01:54:54.420
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3777
01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:56.780
<v Speaker 2>the whole community and the tribe raised each other.</v>

3778
01:54:56.781 --> 01:54:57.830
<v Speaker 2>They all stayed together.</v>

3779
01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:03.650
<v Speaker 2>When that shit slowly start expanding into cities and people slowly lost there,</v>

3780
01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:04.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3781
01:55:04.311 --> 01:55:08.110
<v Speaker 2>you get that diffusion of responsibility feeling where things are happening.</v>

3782
01:55:08.130 --> 01:55:09.650
<v Speaker 2>It Doesn't feel like it belongs to you.</v>

3783
01:55:09.651 --> 01:55:11.300
<v Speaker 2>It's all those people over there.</v>

3784
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:11.790
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3785
01:55:11.790 --> 01:55:13.790
<v Speaker 2>you can't be living with those people over there.</v>

3786
01:55:13.791 --> 01:55:16.700
<v Speaker 2>It should be a giant community or not.</v>

3787
01:55:16.730 --> 01:55:19.070
<v Speaker 2>This is some halfassed way we're doing it today.</v>

3788
01:55:19.370 --> 01:55:20.900
<v Speaker 2>The way we're treating our society.</v>

3789
01:55:20.901 --> 01:55:21.231
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3790
01:55:21.231 --> 01:55:22.910
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're in my tribe,</v>

3791
01:55:22.911 --> 01:55:23.744
<v Speaker 2>but you're not really.</v>

3792
01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:24.111
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3793
01:55:24.111 --> 01:55:24.611
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>

3794
01:55:24.611 --> 01:55:24.801
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3795
01:55:24.801 --> 01:55:26.030
<v Speaker 2>you just lived down the hall from me.</v>

3796
01:55:26.150 --> 01:55:27.980
<v Speaker 2>But still we're all in the same fucking tribe.</v>

3797
01:55:28.090 --> 01:55:29.660
<v Speaker 2>That's the weirdest thing ever.</v>

3798
01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:32.540
<v Speaker 2>It's like your enemy could be inside your tribe.</v>

3799
01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:34.100
<v Speaker 2>That should be impossible.</v>

3800
01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:38.810
<v Speaker 2>We should figure out a way where we are treating everybody the same way.</v>

3801
01:55:38.850 --> 01:55:42.350
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the specific benefits of technology I'm looking forward to in the</v>

3802
01:55:42.351 --> 01:55:43.184
<v Speaker 2>immediate.</v>

3803
01:55:43.290 --> 01:55:44.160
<v Speaker 2>And it's scary when</v>

3804
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:48.180
<v Speaker 5>government control shit like the laser that can read your chemistry from,</v>

3805
01:55:48.210 --> 01:55:51.690
<v Speaker 5>from starbucks really like that.</v>

3806
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.650
<v Speaker 5>And.</v>

3807
01:55:52.650 --> 01:55:53.670
<v Speaker 5>But if you think about it,</v>

3808
01:55:54.330 --> 01:55:57.600
<v Speaker 5>you know what we have with what we're about to have a head mounted iphone,</v>

3809
01:55:57.630 --> 01:55:57.871
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3810
01:55:57.871 --> 01:55:58.950
<v Speaker 5>We've got google glasses.</v>

3811
01:55:59.250 --> 01:56:00.330
<v Speaker 5>That shit's getting smaller,</v>

3812
01:56:00.331 --> 01:56:00.781
<v Speaker 5>faster,</v>

3813
01:56:00.781 --> 01:56:01.830
<v Speaker 5>better that laser thing.</v>

3814
01:56:01.831 --> 01:56:04.350
<v Speaker 5>Eventually that's going to be embedded in your contact lens with the rest of</v>

3815
01:56:04.351 --> 01:56:08.460
<v Speaker 5>your smartphone and you're in your ass and have an injection son eventually</v>

3816
01:56:08.461 --> 01:56:09.330
<v Speaker 5>going to be an injection.</v>

3817
01:56:09.331 --> 01:56:11.940
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be an intramuscular you get in the ass because it's a big muscle.</v>

3818
01:56:11.941 --> 01:56:12.774
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to hurt.</v>

3819
01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:14.370
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be deep inside the tissue.</v>

3820
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:15.181
<v Speaker 5>Boom,</v>

3821
01:56:15.181 --> 01:56:16.350
<v Speaker 5>you're hooked up for wifi,</v>

3822
01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:18.480
<v Speaker 5>but you got information coming in google.</v>

3823
01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:20.880
<v Speaker 5>The only problem is if you,</v>

3824
01:56:20.881 --> 01:56:21.081
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

3825
01:56:21.081 --> 01:56:22.830
<v Speaker 5>if the early chips fuck up,</v>

3826
01:56:22.831 --> 01:56:25.740
<v Speaker 5>they have to go in your ass and pull them out and sometimes you keep a scar.</v>

3827
01:56:26.190 --> 01:56:26.880
<v Speaker 5>People would do it.</v>

3828
01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:27.713
<v Speaker 5>Start rusting.</v>

3829
01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:33.320
<v Speaker 5>The inevitable symbiotic connection between humans and machines is no clearly</v>

3830
01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:36.930
<v Speaker 5>more easily proven than with phones.</v>

3831
01:56:37.170 --> 01:56:38.003
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

3832
01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:38.560
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

3833
01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:40.920
<v Speaker 5>I fucking panic if I leave my phone,</v>

3834
01:56:41.190 --> 01:56:44.070
<v Speaker 5>if I drive in my car and I hold the house and I'm like,</v>

3835
01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:45.210
<v Speaker 5>I don't have my phone.</v>

3836
01:56:45.211 --> 01:56:45.930
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

3837
01:56:45.930 --> 01:56:50.310
<v Speaker 5>I'll be 10 minutes late and it rather than not be there or you'll be getting the</v>

3838
01:56:50.311 --> 01:56:50.701
<v Speaker 5>shakes.</v>

3839
01:56:50.701 --> 01:56:51.060
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3840
01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:51.470
<v Speaker 5>Have you,</v>

3841
01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:54.130
<v Speaker 5>have you tried to help yourself away from that?</v>

3842
01:56:54.190 --> 01:56:55.250
<v Speaker 5>like I like it.</v>

3843
01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:59.640
<v Speaker 5>I've been slowly melting myself away from facebook and twitter and my phone.</v>

3844
01:56:59.790 --> 01:57:02.840
<v Speaker 5>Like I used to be like every time somebody texts me I have to text them back and</v>

3845
01:57:02.841 --> 01:57:03.870
<v Speaker 5>have to do the call.</v>

3846
01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:07.350
<v Speaker 5>Now I just don't even like I'll throw my phone and just not look at it for two</v>

3847
01:57:07.351 --> 01:57:09.930
<v Speaker 5>hours just because it is so like two hours.</v>

3848
01:57:09.980 --> 01:57:11.520
<v Speaker 5>It a long time know exactly.</v>

3849
01:57:11.521 --> 01:57:13.230
<v Speaker 5>But before I was like 10 minutes,</v>

3850
01:57:13.231 --> 01:57:16.290
<v Speaker 5>I was checking my twitter or replying to her text.</v>

3851
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.831
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>

3852
01:57:16.831 --> 01:57:17.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying not to do.</v>

3853
01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:22.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't want you to bother my how crazy benson that doug benson gets all of his</v>

3854
01:57:23.551 --> 01:57:24.510
<v Speaker 5>tweets on his phone.</v>

3855
01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:26.760
<v Speaker 5>So if you really want to fuck with doug benson,</v>

3856
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.980
<v Speaker 5>just tweet him a lot of shit all day and constantly get fucking vibrations in</v>

3857
01:57:31.981 --> 01:57:32.814
<v Speaker 5>his bucket</v>

3858
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:36.300
<v Speaker 5>that his phone doesn't.</v>

3859
01:57:36.330 --> 01:57:36.651
<v Speaker 5>He can't,</v>

3860
01:57:36.651 --> 01:57:36.850
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3861
01:57:36.850 --> 01:57:37.950
<v Speaker 5>you don't get any of his message.</v>

3862
01:57:37.951 --> 01:57:40.170
<v Speaker 5>I don't get any of his tweets and texts.</v>

3863
01:57:40.171 --> 01:57:41.910
<v Speaker 5>Rather he sent me like four or five texts.</v>

3864
01:57:41.911 --> 01:57:42.860
<v Speaker 5>I didn't get a single one of them,</v>

3865
01:57:42.861 --> 01:57:43.171
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3866
01:57:43.171 --> 01:57:44.040
<v Speaker 5>he did it again,</v>

3867
01:57:44.041 --> 01:57:44.580
<v Speaker 5>like uh,</v>

3868
01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:45.030
<v Speaker 5>like uh,</v>

3869
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:46.590
<v Speaker 5>the following day he's just been like,</v>

3870
01:57:46.630 --> 01:57:47.200
<v Speaker 5>doing this,</v>

3871
01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:50.310
<v Speaker 5>you get this and it doesn't say delivered like how it does,</v>

3872
01:57:50.610 --> 01:57:52.440
<v Speaker 5>but then you text him and it worked fine.</v>

3873
01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:53.460
<v Speaker 5>That's so strange.</v>

3874
01:57:53.461 --> 01:57:55.260
<v Speaker 5>But then he texts me back and it was okay.</v>

3875
01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:56.473
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3876
01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:57.570
<v Speaker 5>he texts me back.</v>

3877
01:57:57.900 --> 01:57:59.450
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make any sense now.</v>

3878
01:57:59.520 --> 01:57:59.641
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3879
01:57:59.641 --> 01:58:02.640
<v Speaker 5>He was showing me all the texts he'd been since June 20th,</v>

3880
01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:03.511
<v Speaker 5>probably the cia,</v>

3881
01:58:03.511 --> 01:58:07.560
<v Speaker 5>the cia and the dea are looking at him as a potential source of all the</v>

3882
01:58:07.561 --> 01:58:08.790
<v Speaker 5>marijuana in California,</v>

3883
01:58:08.950 --> 01:58:09.750
<v Speaker 5>if you can imagine,</v>

3884
01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:13.560
<v Speaker 5>found out the dog was a drug dealer and that he was being wired.</v>

3885
01:58:13.590 --> 01:58:14.910
<v Speaker 5>That's why he's following us around.</v>

3886
01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:16.950
<v Speaker 5>The cia had already compromised him.</v>

3887
01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:19.050
<v Speaker 5>We were in vegas after the show,</v>

3888
01:58:20.130 --> 01:58:24.590
<v Speaker 5>we went to go play some slot machines and we were both smoking out of apples and</v>

3889
01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:26.300
<v Speaker 5>just like getting a.</v>

3890
01:58:26.410 --> 01:58:27.241
<v Speaker 5>By the way I should say,</v>

3891
01:58:27.241 --> 01:58:28.170
<v Speaker 5>I don't really believe that.</v>

3892
01:58:28.171 --> 01:58:31.130
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't even say that on the internet because somebody fox go to lock onto</v>

3893
01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:31.770
<v Speaker 5>that and thank you.</v>

3894
01:58:31.770 --> 01:58:32.730
<v Speaker 5>I was being serious,</v>

3895
01:58:33.210 --> 01:58:33.840
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

3896
01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:36.840
<v Speaker 5>but we were smoking some kind of butter or something out of an apple like weed</v>

3897
01:58:36.841 --> 01:58:40.110
<v Speaker 5>butter and smoking weed butter or something.</v>

3898

3899
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:42.190

3964
02:00:33.561 --> 02:00:36.200
<v Speaker 4>I used to be really manic and stay up all night editing videos.</v>

3965
02:00:36.201 --> 02:00:38.030
<v Speaker 4>That always makes you look a little less crazy.</v>

3966
02:00:38.090 --> 02:00:38.361
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3967

02:00:39.410 --> 02:00:39.981
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3969
02:00:39.981 --> 02:00:43.400

3974
02:00:48.290 --> 02:00:49.810
<v Speaker 4>Well now I'm getting better about my routine.</v>

3975
02:00:49.811 --> 02:00:53.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting some interns that are really helpful and are able to handle my</v>

3976
02:00:53.490 --> 02:00:54.261

02:00:54.530 --> 02:00:57.800
<v Speaker 4>I've actually been operating as an llc for the last couple of years,</v>

3979
02:00:58.150 --> 02:00:59.370
<v Speaker 4>but you are the man dude.</v>

3980
02:00:59.370 --> 02:01:01.250
<v Speaker 4>You're a part of the machine.</v>

3981
02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:02.830
<v Speaker 4>You're an llc now.</v>

3982
02:01:02.850 --> 02:01:04.820
<v Speaker 4>This is how I don't pay as many taxes.</v>

3983
02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:05.421
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You can protest all you want as long as you keep paying your taxes.</v>

3989
02:01:14.570 --> 02:01:16.910
<v Speaker 4>Pretty ridiculous that the government doesn't give you a receipt.</v>

3990
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:17.240
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Can you at least give me a breakdown?</v>

3993
02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:23.240
<v Speaker 4>They don't even have the courtesy to give you a breakdown.</v>

3994
02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:27.380
<v Speaker 4>You know Mr. Koch cash you spend $40,000 in taxes last year.</v>

3996
02:01:28.970 --> 02:01:29.900
<v Speaker 4>You have to dig for it.</v>

4013
02:01:45.651 --> 02:01:45.981
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

4014
02:01:45.981 --> 02:01:46.940
<v Speaker 5>it's as a whole.</v>

4015
02:01:46.941 --> 02:01:47.481
<v Speaker 5>It's not work.</v>

4016
02:01:47.481 --> 02:01:48.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean I love,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean we can say it's not work.</v>

4019
02:01:51.090 --> 02:01:51.940
<v Speaker 5>It's there.</v>

4020
02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:53.300
<v Speaker 5>There's always work involved.</v>

4021
02:01:53.301 --> 02:01:54.200
<v Speaker 5>Even in not work,</v>

4022
02:01:54.201 --> 02:01:55.040
<v Speaker 5>even athletics,</v>

4023
02:01:55.041 --> 02:01:57.200
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking work involved and all and everything,</v>

4024
02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:01.490
<v Speaker 5>but you want to do it is you want the exact different feeling than working for</v>

4025
02:02:01.491 --> 02:02:05.270
<v Speaker 5>somebody that's working for an intrinsic goal or for an extrinsic goal.</v>

02:02:05.330 --> 02:02:05.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

4027

02:02:07.041 --> 02:02:07.791
<v Speaker 5>I'm loving my life.</v>

4029
02:02:07.791 --> 02:02:10.370
<v Speaker 5>And then you're doing it with the right frame of mind.</v>

4030
02:02:10.371 --> 02:02:11.360
<v Speaker 5>With the right spirit.</v>

4031
02:02:11.361 --> 02:02:13.850
<v Speaker 5>you're doing it in the spirit of trying to change things and help things.</v>

4032
02:02:13.851 --> 02:02:18.320
<v Speaker 5>You're not doing it in the spirit of self randomization or you know,</v>

4033
02:02:18.321 --> 02:02:19.820
<v Speaker 5>you're not trying to pump yourself up.</v>

4034
02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:21.720
<v Speaker 5>And so I go to wholefoods,</v>

4087
02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:45.693
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a goal?</v>

4088
02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:47.130
<v Speaker 5>Try enlightened people.</v>

4089
02:03:47.131 --> 02:03:48.140
<v Speaker 5>Are you trying to change things?</v>

4090
02:03:48.141 --> 02:03:48.974
<v Speaker 5>Like what is your,</v>

4091
02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:49.903
<v Speaker 5>what's your idea?</v>

4092
02:03:50.530 --> 02:03:54.580
<v Speaker 4>You see it as part of a larger goal of evolving past statism and getting past</v>

4093
02:03:54.581 --> 02:03:59.050
<v Speaker 4>this particular phase of human evolution where we institutionalize all of our</v>

4094
02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:03.280
<v Speaker 4>desires to dominate and control others by force into government and you know,</v>

4095
02:04:03.550 --> 02:04:04.450
<v Speaker 4>you understand this,</v>

4096
02:04:04.451 --> 02:04:05.650
<v Speaker 4>you've supported ron paul,</v>

4097
02:04:05.651 --> 02:04:08.980
<v Speaker 4>you've come out and and and you see when a candidate speaks from this</v>

4098
02:04:08.981 --> 02:04:09.581
<v Speaker 4>philosophy,</v>

4099
02:04:09.581 --> 02:04:12.850
<v Speaker 4>and this is what we have in common is this idea of volunteerism,</v>

4100
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:13.300
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

4101
02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:15.580
<v Speaker 4>of all human interactions being voluntary,</v>

4102
02:04:15.581 --> 02:04:16.241
<v Speaker 4>free of force,</v>

4103
02:04:16.241 --> 02:04:19.990
<v Speaker 4>fraud and coercion and understanding that government is what George Washington</v>

4104
02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:20.831
<v Speaker 4>described it as.</v>

4105
02:04:20.831 --> 02:04:22.530
<v Speaker 4>It is not eloquence or reason.</v>

4106
02:04:22.531 --> 02:04:24.670
<v Speaker 4>It is like four or it is like fire.</v>

4107
02:04:25.210 --> 02:04:26.580
<v Speaker 4>It is forced like fire,</v>

4108
02:04:26.590 --> 02:04:27.390
<v Speaker 4>a dangerous servant,</v>

4109
02:04:27.390 --> 02:04:28.360
<v Speaker 4>a fearful master,</v>

4110
02:04:28.361 --> 02:04:32.680
<v Speaker 4>and when you understand that government is forced and 99 percent of what it does</v>

4111
02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:35.290
<v Speaker 4>or doesn't qualify as a morally justified use of force,</v>

4112
02:04:35.291 --> 02:04:40.291
<v Speaker 4>whether it's starting wars are collecting or beating people up for a plant or</v>

4113
02:04:40.621 --> 02:04:42.960
<v Speaker 4>locking them in cages because we don't like what they're doing.</v>

4114
02:04:43.230 --> 02:04:47.820
<v Speaker 4>It's all immoral and we can find ways to do these things peacefully.</v>

4115
02:04:47.821 --> 02:04:50.460
<v Speaker 4>We can find ways without democracy,</v>

4116
02:04:50.461 --> 02:04:54.600
<v Speaker 4>without the majority imposing its will by forcing the minority and using this.</v>

4117
02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:58.020
<v Speaker 4>Well we have 51 percent is a cover so we can,</v>

4118
02:04:58.021 --> 02:04:58.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4119
02:04:58.200 --> 02:04:59.650
<v Speaker 4>we're justified in doing that and,</v>

4120
02:05:00.110 --> 02:05:02.460
<v Speaker 4>and that's part of the bigger goal,</v>

4121
02:05:02.461 --> 02:05:02.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4122
02:05:02.761 --> 02:05:02.970
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4123
02:05:02.970 --> 02:05:04.490
<v Speaker 4>and really this is what,</v>

4124
02:05:04.620 --> 02:05:08.490
<v Speaker 4>what I think a lot of people want me to inspire you to be a part of and to</v>

4125
02:05:08.491 --> 02:05:11.550
<v Speaker 4>really see yourself as someone who was part of the struggle and,</v>

4126
02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:16.560
<v Speaker 4>and someone who can see past someone who has your wisdom to see past the current</v>

4127
02:05:17.221 --> 02:05:19.710
<v Speaker 4>paradigm and see that there is something better on the other side.</v>

4128
02:05:20.250 --> 02:05:21.083
<v Speaker 4>Well I think,</v>

4129
02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:22.013
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

4130
02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:24.960
<v Speaker 4>there's certainly a potential for something better,</v>

4131
02:05:25.020 --> 02:05:26.850
<v Speaker 4>but it's going to have to come through the youth.</v>

4132
02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:30.930
<v Speaker 4>They're going to have to grow up into the system and change it because it's</v>

4133
02:05:30.931 --> 02:05:34.470
<v Speaker 4>changed from the time where people were wearing white fucking powdered wigs and</v>

4134
02:05:34.471 --> 02:05:36.840
<v Speaker 4>they thought the world was flat and it's going to change.</v>

4135
02:05:36.930 --> 02:05:38.190
<v Speaker 4>Is that an hour as well?</v>

4136
02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:39.900
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>

4137
02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:40.560
<v Speaker 4>How is it a cop out?</v>

4138
02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:41.393
<v Speaker 4>Because I heard,</v>

4139
02:05:41.850 --> 02:05:46.850
<v Speaker 4>I heard a review of your podcast saying that you were like a big brother to a</v>

4140
02:05:47.191 --> 02:05:48.024
<v Speaker 4>lot of people that,</v>

4141
02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:50.250
<v Speaker 4>that you really serve that role.</v>

4142
02:05:50.260 --> 02:05:51.440
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a really powerful one.</v>

4143
02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:52.293
<v Speaker 4>I've tried it,</v>

4144
02:05:52.590 --> 02:05:56.970
<v Speaker 2>that statement about the evolution of people figuring out things through the</v>

4145
02:05:56.971 --> 02:05:57.751
<v Speaker 2>youth and the youth.</v>

4146
02:05:57.751 --> 02:05:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Learning from the mistakes of the what,</v>

4147
02:05:59.300 --> 02:06:02.970
<v Speaker 2>what part of that is a cop out because you're in a position to be a leader.</v>

4148
02:06:04.890 --> 02:06:05.310
<v Speaker 4>You don't have.</v>

4149
02:06:05.310 --> 02:06:06.180
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to wait for the youth.</v>

4150
02:06:06.181 --> 02:06:06.391
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4151
02:06:06.391 --> 02:06:06.720
<v Speaker 4>it's happened.</v>

4152
02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:07.553
<v Speaker 4>This sounds like.</v>

4153
02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:08.161
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>

4154
02:06:08.161 --> 02:06:08.550
<v Speaker 4>What is that</v>

4155
02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:09.120
<v Speaker 2>dude's name?</v>

4156
02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:09.630
<v Speaker 2>Not my.</v>

4157
02:06:09.630 --> 02:06:10.351
<v Speaker 2>Not charlie sheen.</v>

4158
02:06:10.351 --> 02:06:11.184
<v Speaker 2>What's his brother?</v>

4159
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:15.270
<v Speaker 2>His emilio estevez plot from like 1994.</v>

4160
02:06:16.020 --> 02:06:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4161
02:06:16.830 --> 02:06:17.670
<v Speaker 2>what does a leader do?</v>

4162
02:06:17.850 --> 02:06:18.750
<v Speaker 2>What I do,</v>

4163
02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:21.840
<v Speaker 2>if it inspires people and they may choose to act,</v>

4164
02:06:21.870 --> 02:06:23.820
<v Speaker 2>that's my job to do anything else.</v>

4165
02:06:23.821 --> 02:06:27.570
<v Speaker 2>It's not my job to do any thing else is not what I do best.</v>

4166
02:06:27.571 --> 02:06:32.490
<v Speaker 2>It's not what I have in mind when I get up every day and I wouldn't want to do</v>

4167
02:06:32.491 --> 02:06:33.360
<v Speaker 2>it because I wouldn't be happy.</v>

4168
02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:36.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that everybody has to be involved in government.</v>

4169
02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:37.110
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4170
02:06:37.110 --> 02:06:38.400
<v Speaker 4>it's inside government is.</v>

4171
02:06:38.430 --> 02:06:40.660
<v Speaker 4>Even antigovernment is the evolution of humanity.</v>

4172
02:06:40.710 --> 02:06:44.890
<v Speaker 4>It's what ron paul talks about it and getting into a voluntary society.</v>

4173
02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:45.571
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4174
02:06:45.571 --> 02:06:46.404
<v Speaker 4>I would certainly,</v>

4175
02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:49.430
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I talk about it as much as possible on the podcast.</v>

4176
02:06:49.431 --> 02:06:53.780
<v Speaker 2>It's my job to inspire and communicate information and ideas but not delete.</v>

4177
02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:55.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any desire to do that.</v>

4178
02:06:55.371 --> 02:06:57.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any desire to be a part of that,</v>

4179
02:06:57.081 --> 02:06:57.191
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4180
02:06:57.191 --> 02:06:58.970
<v Speaker 2>have any desire to tell the people what to do.</v>

4181
02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:02.810
<v Speaker 2>I love the idea of being a leader is disgusting for me,</v>

4182
02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:05.210
<v Speaker 2>which is probably what you need in a leader.</v>

4183
02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:08.420
<v Speaker 4>The real problem with leaders is they want to be leader.</v>

4184
02:07:08.450 --> 02:07:09.740
<v Speaker 4>It's about being no,</v>

4185
02:07:09.741 --> 02:07:10.030
<v Speaker 4>but see,</v>

4186
02:07:10.030 --> 02:07:10.431
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

4187
02:07:10.431 --> 02:07:10.761
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

4188
02:07:10.761 --> 02:07:12.550
<v Speaker 4>And it's a different kind of leadership that we're talking about.</v>

4189
02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:14.700
<v Speaker 4>And I be the best leader beCause I would be,</v>

4190
02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:15.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be a leader.</v>

4191
02:07:15.591 --> 02:07:16.790
<v Speaker 4>I want you should be a fuck.</v>

4192
02:07:16.791 --> 02:07:18.830
<v Speaker 4>I hesitate to use that term myself.</v>

4193
02:07:18.831 --> 02:07:19.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4194
02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:23.390
<v Speaker 4>and people try to apply it to me and I say absolutely not because you know,</v>

4195
02:07:23.730 --> 02:07:28.010
<v Speaker 4>I can set an example in a way you'd better have a good handle on your ego when</v>

4196
02:07:28.011 --> 02:07:29.160
<v Speaker 4>you start calling yourself a legal,</v>

4197
02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:29.931
<v Speaker 4>a leader.</v>

4198
02:07:29.931 --> 02:07:30.060
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>

4199
02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:30.541
<v Speaker 4>But that's why.</v>

4200
02:07:30.541 --> 02:07:31.630
<v Speaker 4>That's why I don't.</v>

4201
02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:34.220
<v Speaker 4>That's why I don't let myself think of it that way.</v>

4202
02:07:34.370 --> 02:07:36.610
<v Speaker 4>So I let you talk about someone involved</v>

4203
02:07:36.610 --> 02:07:39.450
<v Speaker 2>at the highest levels of political office that hasn't done psychedelics.</v>

4204
02:07:39.470 --> 02:07:39.731
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4205
02:07:39.731 --> 02:07:43.870
<v Speaker 2>you are like a little blindfolded child behind the wheel of a ferrari and you're</v>

4206
02:07:43.871 --> 02:07:45.040
<v Speaker 2>going to crash that fucking thing.</v>

4207
02:07:45.041 --> 02:07:45.551
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

4208
02:07:45.551 --> 02:07:47.800
<v Speaker 2>You made it all the way to the very peak of government.</v>

4209
02:07:48.010 --> 02:07:50.320
<v Speaker 2>What did you do along the way that's gross?</v>

4210
02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:51.280
<v Speaker 2>You did something.</v>

4211
02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:55.330
<v Speaker 2>What'd you do is somebody that committed suicide by shooting themselves in the</v>

4212
02:07:55.331 --> 02:07:56.110
<v Speaker 2>head twice.</v>

4213
02:07:56.110 --> 02:07:57.340
<v Speaker 2>It was any of those in your closet.</v>

4214
02:07:57.341 --> 02:07:58.630
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck did you do to get here?</v>

4215
02:07:58.631 --> 02:07:59.080
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

4216
02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:00.160
<v Speaker 2>you don't just get here.</v>

4217
02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:00.881
<v Speaker 2>You get here,</v>

4218
02:08:00.881 --> 02:08:01.750
<v Speaker 2>you're compromised.</v>

4219
02:08:01.751 --> 02:08:02.560
<v Speaker 2>Period.</v>

4220
02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:06.280
<v Speaker 2>To have them get to that stage of running things and not having psychedelic</v>

4221
02:08:06.281 --> 02:08:08.590
<v Speaker 2>experiences is really kind of childlike.</v>

4222
02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:10.390
<v Speaker 2>I think the human being,</v>

4223
02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:14.830
<v Speaker 2>but so far as to say who haven't experienced psychedelics are in a in a</v>

4224
02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:17.200
<v Speaker 2>childlike mental state of awareness.</v>

4225
02:08:17.230 --> 02:08:19.900
<v Speaker 2>I would never say that about them because I don't know how they feel about the</v>

4226
02:08:19.901 --> 02:08:20.231
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

4227
02:08:20.231 --> 02:08:23.740
<v Speaker 2>but I know for me I was certainly very childlike before I did the emt.</v>

4228
02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I was very self centered.</v>

4229
02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:31.930
<v Speaker 2>I had a very different perspective on my place in the universe,</v>

4230
02:08:32.070 --> 02:08:36.100
<v Speaker 2>a very different perspective on my place in humanity,</v>

4231
02:08:36.310 --> 02:08:37.990
<v Speaker 2>my place with my friends,</v>

4232
02:08:37.991 --> 02:08:42.580
<v Speaker 2>my place that I put everything into perspective and showed me an illuminated</v>

4233
02:08:42.610 --> 02:08:47.610
<v Speaker 2>correct pathway and I think it's by the humbling experience destroys your ego,</v>

4234
02:08:47.981 --> 02:08:52.060
<v Speaker 2>makes you just sit the fuck down and stopped trying to control everything.</v>

4235
02:08:52.061 --> 02:08:54.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like the universe is really a magical place.</v>

4236
02:08:54.731 --> 02:08:58.060
<v Speaker 2>If yOu just absorbed only the magical aspects of the universe,</v>

4237
02:08:58.061 --> 02:09:00.430
<v Speaker 2>you'd be constantly fascinated every hour of every day.</v>

4238
02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:05.410
<v Speaker 2>BuT we forget that and get caught up and distracted in the horseshit tmz and</v>

4239
02:09:05.411 --> 02:09:06.520
<v Speaker 2>nonsense and it's just.</v>

4240
02:09:06.850 --> 02:09:11.850
<v Speaker 2>We are still struggling with this fucking weird primate body that is trying to</v>

4241
02:09:13.451 --> 02:09:18.451
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to manage massive groups of people and insane volumes of</v>

4242
02:09:18.911 --> 02:09:21.190
<v Speaker 2>information coming at us all day long.</v>

4243
02:09:21.550 --> 02:09:22.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

4244
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:23.080
<v Speaker 2>that's where we stand now.</v>

4245
02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:23.251
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

4246
02:09:23.251 --> 02:09:23.710
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

4247
02:09:23.710 --> 02:09:24.760
<v Speaker 2>that's our conundrum.</v>

4248
02:09:24.910 --> 02:09:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Our conundrum is we're,</v>

4249
02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:27.340
<v Speaker 2>we're surfing,</v>

4250
02:09:27.370 --> 02:09:29.920
<v Speaker 2>but we might not stay on the board before we hit the rocks.</v>

4251
02:09:30.250 --> 02:09:30.491
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4252
02:09:30.491 --> 02:09:33.670
<v Speaker 2>we might focus you in on this whole mother fucker and that's no joke.</v>

4253
02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:34.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4254
02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:35.350
<v Speaker 2>we've just seen a few,</v>

4255
02:09:35.540 --> 02:09:37.750
<v Speaker 2>a few interruptions here and there.</v>

4256
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:39.670
<v Speaker 2>One fuck doesn't motivate,</v>

4257
02:09:39.671 --> 02:09:40.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4258
02:09:40.250 --> 02:09:41.140
<v Speaker 2>doesn't that motivate.</v>

4259
02:09:41.141 --> 02:09:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Certainly motivates me to live the most out of my life and motivates me to put</v>

4260
02:09:45.491 --> 02:09:48.030
<v Speaker 2>out the most more podcast,</v>

4261
02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:50.470
<v Speaker 2>to do more standup comedy,</v>

4262
02:09:50.471 --> 02:09:51.580
<v Speaker 2>to have more fun,</v>

4263
02:09:51.581 --> 02:09:52.271
<v Speaker 2>to enjoy life,</v>

4264
02:09:52.271 --> 02:09:52.981
<v Speaker 2>to enjoy my friends.</v>

4265
02:09:52.981 --> 02:09:53.950
<v Speaker 2>It motivates me to do that.</v>

4266
02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:55.030
<v Speaker 2>That's what motivates me to.</v>

4267
02:09:55.110 --> 02:09:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4268
02:09:55.810 --> 02:09:57.140
<v Speaker 2>just I think you have a,</v>

4269
02:09:57.141 --> 02:09:57.431
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

4270
02:09:57.431 --> 02:09:58.960
<v Speaker 2>a different track.</v>

4271
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.321
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4272
02:09:59.321 --> 02:10:00.250
<v Speaker 2>you're on this.</v>

4273
02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:01.540
<v Speaker 2>We've got to get shit done,</v>

4274
02:10:01.541 --> 02:10:03.240
<v Speaker 2>civil disobedience and go after them.</v>

4275
02:10:03.241 --> 02:10:04.510
<v Speaker 2>If you're on this track,</v>

4276
02:10:04.810 --> 02:10:05.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4277
02:10:05.171 --> 02:10:06.220
<v Speaker 2>and to say that like,</v>

4278
02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:08.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm a leader and I need to be a part of that track,</v>

4279
02:10:08.741 --> 02:10:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

4280
02:10:10.290 --> 02:10:11.170
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

4281
02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:12.610
<v Speaker 2>It's not that you need to be.</v>

4282
02:10:12.611 --> 02:10:13.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm just inviting you to be.</v>

4283
02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:13.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4284
02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:14.860
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it.</v>

4285
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:15.581
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it.</v>

4286
02:10:15.581 --> 02:10:17.650
<v Speaker 2>It's an I'm not saying that I'm in any way,</v>

4287
02:10:17.651 --> 02:10:18.880
<v Speaker 2>shape or form critical of it.</v>

4288
02:10:18.910 --> 02:10:22.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm inviting you to nurture the part of you that already is on this track.</v>

4289
02:10:24.450 --> 02:10:27.130
<v Speaker 2>I would never do that if a guest asks me to nurture it out,</v>

4290
02:10:27.131 --> 02:10:29.140
<v Speaker 2>but it's what you already are.</v>

4291
02:10:29.170 --> 02:10:30.880
<v Speaker 2>You already are anti-authoritarian.</v>

4292
02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:33.340
<v Speaker 2>You are not anti authoritarian.</v>

4293
02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:35.630
<v Speaker 2>What I am is I'm pro nice.</v>

4294
02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:36.561
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

4295
02:10:36.561 --> 02:10:39.230
<v Speaker 2>and the real problem with any sort of authority.</v>

4296
02:10:39.231 --> 02:10:44.210
<v Speaker 2>I was a fucking security guard for one summer at great center for the performing</v>

4297
02:10:44.211 --> 02:10:46.220
<v Speaker 2>arts place in mansfield,</v>

4298
02:10:46.221 --> 02:10:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts.</v>

4299
02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:49.850
<v Speaker 2>I got to see fucking amazing bands.</v>

4300
02:10:49.851 --> 02:10:54.310
<v Speaker 2>I got to see rodney dangerfield performed live naked in a bathrobe.</v>

4301
02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:55.880
<v Speaker 2>Rodney dangerfield would wear a bathrobe,</v>

4302
02:10:55.881 --> 02:10:56.240
<v Speaker 2>and I was.</v>

4303
02:10:56.240 --> 02:10:56.810
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

4304
02:10:56.810 --> 02:10:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Now I feel like I need to take it about being a comedian man,</v>

4305
02:10:59.390 --> 02:10:59.840
<v Speaker 2>and when I.</v>

4306
02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:00.830
<v Speaker 2>This is how we'd go on stage.</v>

4307
02:11:00.831 --> 02:11:02.110
<v Speaker 2>She would go on stage with a bathrobe on.</v>

4308
02:11:02.330 --> 02:11:03.530
<v Speaker 2>He was such a bad motherfucker.</v>

4309
02:11:03.531 --> 02:11:05.420
<v Speaker 2>I got to see bill cosby where I worked there,</v>

4310
02:11:05.690 --> 02:11:07.410
<v Speaker 2>but we were at a um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can't remember his name.</v>

4317
02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:15.410
<v Speaker 2>A southern man.</v>

4318
02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:16.120
<v Speaker 2>Neil young,</v>

4319
02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:20.800
<v Speaker 2>a neil young concert and they started fires up in the,</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4321
02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:21.691
<v Speaker 2>there was like a,</v>

4322
02:11:21.691 --> 02:11:24.860
<v Speaker 2>a wooded area or a brother or a grassy area at the top.</v>

4323
02:11:24.861 --> 02:11:26.480
<v Speaker 2>It was like an amphitheater outside.</v>

4324
02:11:26.780 --> 02:11:29.840
<v Speaker 2>And then there was a top area that was crashed with people decided to start</v>

4325
02:11:29.841 --> 02:11:32.450
<v Speaker 2>fires and fucking hell broke loose dude.</v>

4326
02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:35.210
<v Speaker 2>And it became an us versus them thing.</v>

4327
02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:37.670
<v Speaker 2>It became a us 19 year old kid.</v>

4328
02:11:37.670 --> 02:11:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Security guard,</v>

4329
02:11:38.771 --> 02:11:39.604
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4330
02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:44.090
<v Speaker 2>and my friends who also worked there against all these people who were neil</v>

4331
02:11:44.091 --> 02:11:48.290
<v Speaker 2>young France who were fucked up on drugs and starting chaos and starting things</v>

4332
02:11:48.291 --> 02:11:48.920
<v Speaker 2>on fire.</v>

4333
02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:52.290
<v Speaker 2>And I watched like people hit people that I'd never would have thought would</v>

4334
02:11:52.291 --> 02:11:53.120
<v Speaker 2>have hit somebody.</v>

4335
02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Like my friend larry was one of the nicest,</v>

4336
02:11:55.070 --> 02:11:56.300
<v Speaker 2>most peace loving guys.</v>

4337
02:11:56.420 --> 02:11:58.680
<v Speaker 2>And I watched him punch this dude in the stomach and I'm like,</v>

4338
02:11:58.700 --> 02:11:58.801
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4339
02:11:58.801 --> 02:12:00.770
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe larry just hit that guy.</v>

4340
02:12:01.050 --> 02:12:01.380
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4341
02:12:01.380 --> 02:12:03.140
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get the fuck outta here.</v>

4342
02:12:03.260 --> 02:12:06.950
<v Speaker 2>But it was an immediate us versus them thing that happens when you.</v>

4343
02:12:07.550 --> 02:12:10.310
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a real problem if you're not educated,</v>

4344
02:12:10.311 --> 02:12:10.611
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4345
02:12:10.611 --> 02:12:13.400
<v Speaker 2>If you work in any position of authority and position of,</v>

4346
02:12:13.670 --> 02:12:13.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4347
02:12:13.971 --> 02:12:14.241
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

4348
02:12:14.241 --> 02:12:14.480
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

4349
02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:17.380
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have some control and be able to tell people and to build,</v>

4350
02:12:17.610 --> 02:12:21.920
<v Speaker 2>you've got to work compassionate to that because when you don't have that,</v>

4351
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:23.780
<v Speaker 2>when you lose that,</v>

4352
02:12:23.970 --> 02:12:24.380
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

4353
02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:25.970
<v Speaker 2>that we're all in this together,</v>

4354
02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:27.500
<v Speaker 2>then you're not a cop man.</v>

4355
02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:29.300
<v Speaker 2>You're the fucking enemy like that.</v>

4356
02:12:29.390 --> 02:12:30.850
<v Speaker 2>You saw that video in,</v>

4357
02:12:30.980 --> 02:12:34.460
<v Speaker 2>in long beach where that kid is lying down and they step on his head.</v>

4358
02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:35.750
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that thomas,</v>

4359
02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:37.730
<v Speaker 2>the one that died in the hospital?</v>

4360
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:38.121
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4361
02:12:38.121 --> 02:12:38.301

4364
02:12:38.631 --> 02:12:38.781
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4365
02:12:38.781 --> 02:12:38.931
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4366
02:12:38.931 --> 02:12:39.111
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4367
02:12:39.111 --> 02:12:39.740
<v Speaker 2>He didn't die.</v>

4368
02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:40.071
<v Speaker 2>The kid,</v>

4369
02:12:40.071 --> 02:12:41.660
<v Speaker 2>the kid who was in a,</v>

4370
02:12:41.661 --> 02:12:42.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4371
02:12:42.110 --> 02:12:44.510
<v Speaker 2>long beach medical marijuana dispensary,</v>

4372
02:12:44.511 --> 02:12:45.344
<v Speaker 2>the cops came in and</v>

4373
02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:47.961
<v Speaker 2>stepped on.</v>

4374
02:12:47.961 --> 02:12:48.781
<v Speaker 2>The guy is a real,</v>

4375
02:12:48.781 --> 02:12:49.780
<v Speaker 2>really recent radio.</v>

4376
02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:50.623
<v Speaker 2>You might notice it,</v>

4377
02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:53.720
<v Speaker 2>but anybody who would do something like that,</v>

4378
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:57.350
<v Speaker 2>you get a peaceful person who's just lying down.</v>

4379
02:12:57.380 --> 02:12:58.213
<v Speaker 2>Pathological,</v>

4380
02:12:58.340 --> 02:12:58.920
<v Speaker 2>pathological.</v>

4381
02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:01.030
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing as what government is it?</v>

4382
02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:04.340
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing that chimps would do if they could do that to other chips.</v>

4383
02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:05.870
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking primal.</v>

4384
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.611
<v Speaker 2>It's prime.</v>

4385
02:13:06.611 --> 02:13:06.711
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4386
02:13:06.711 --> 02:13:07.640
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>

4387
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Selfish behavior and that's.</v>

4388
02:13:10.070 --> 02:13:12.320
<v Speaker 2>That's what really needs to be eradicated.</v>

4389
02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:14.570
<v Speaker 2>We need to figure out a way to connect people.</v>

4390
02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:15.200
<v Speaker 2>That's what this.</v>

4391
02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:16.220
<v Speaker 2>But that's what this is about.</v>

4392
02:13:16.370 --> 02:13:17.570
<v Speaker 2>That's what this movement is about.</v>

4393
02:13:17.610 --> 02:13:18.000
<v Speaker 2>That's what.</v>

4394
02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:18.833
<v Speaker 2>That's what the revolution.</v>

4395
02:13:19.290 --> 02:13:20.960
<v Speaker 2>What is the revenue load is the movement.</v>

4396
02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:22.710
<v Speaker 2>This was star wars revolution.</v>

4397
02:13:22.850 --> 02:13:23.683
<v Speaker 2>The revolution.</v>

4398
02:13:24.110 --> 02:13:25.170
<v Speaker 2>You know how you you.</v>

4399
02:13:25.220 --> 02:13:28.020
<v Speaker 2>You saw the ron Paul Love evolution where it's,</v>

4400
02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:30.050
<v Speaker 2>it's revolutionary that evil is backwards.</v>

4401
02:13:30.051 --> 02:13:30.890
<v Speaker 2>So it says love.</v>

4402
02:13:30.940 --> 02:13:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4403
02:13:31.330 --> 02:13:32.163
<v Speaker 2>That's how we</v>

4404
02:13:32.180 --> 02:13:33.270
<v Speaker 4>say the revolution,</v>

4405
02:13:33.540 --> 02:13:34.650
<v Speaker 4>and really that's what it's about.</v>

4406
02:13:34.651 --> 02:13:36.910
<v Speaker 4>It's about embracing the,</v>

4407
02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:40.000
<v Speaker 4>the divinity of every human being and,</v>

4408
02:13:40.001 --> 02:13:40.121
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4409
02:13:40.121 --> 02:13:41.880
<v Speaker 4>and treating every human being with the love,</v>

4410
02:13:41.881 --> 02:13:43.830
<v Speaker 4>faith and respect that we want for ourselves,</v>

4411
02:13:43.831 --> 02:13:47.730
<v Speaker 4>and we're coming to the point where we're realizing this anyways because the</v>

4412
02:13:47.731 --> 02:13:49.620
<v Speaker 4>market favors cooperation.</v>

4413
02:13:49.621 --> 02:13:50.580
<v Speaker 4>The market favors that.</v>

4414
02:13:50.581 --> 02:13:53.570
<v Speaker 4>People who are able to get along or able to be more prosperous aren't,</v>

4415
02:13:53.580 --> 02:13:53.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4416
02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:56.160
<v Speaker 4>able to out reproduce outcompete the ones that aren't.</v>

4417
02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:58.590
<v Speaker 4>And so It's kind of happening anyways,</v>

4418
02:13:58.591 --> 02:13:59.900
<v Speaker 4>but what's exciting and,</v>

4419
02:13:59.901 --> 02:14:00.191
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

4420
02:14:00.191 --> 02:14:02.000
<v Speaker 4>and really this is why I don't want,</v>

4421
02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:03.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm not here to tell you like</v>

4422
02:14:04.030 --> 02:14:05.660
<v Speaker 2>you have an obligation to do this.</v>

4423
02:14:05.661 --> 02:14:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

4424
02:14:06.100 --> 02:14:06.970
<v Speaker 2>if you don't vote,</v>

4425
02:14:06.971 --> 02:14:08.480
<v Speaker 2>you're an irresponsible citizen.</v>

4426
02:14:08.650 --> 02:14:09.590
<v Speaker 4>It's not that bullshit.</v>

4427
02:14:09.591 --> 02:14:14.150
<v Speaker 4>It's just that this is something that motivates me in the same way that you have</v>

4428
02:14:14.151 --> 02:14:15.200
<v Speaker 4>a similar motivation,</v>

4429
02:14:15.430 --> 02:14:15.671
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

4430
02:14:15.671 --> 02:14:15.961
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

4431
02:14:15.961 --> 02:14:17.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm the oldest of five brothers.</v>

4432
02:14:17.301 --> 02:14:18.260
<v Speaker 4>It's adam,</v>

4433
02:14:18.530 --> 02:14:19.011
<v Speaker 4>andrew,</v>

4434
02:14:19.011 --> 02:14:20.430
<v Speaker 4>alex aldean and andrea my,</v>

4435
02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:21.940
<v Speaker 4>my dad has a big white suburban,</v>

4436
02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:23.360
<v Speaker 4>the license plates as 18.</v>

4437
02:14:23.690 --> 02:14:24.050
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4438
02:14:24.050 --> 02:14:24.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4439
02:14:24.351 --> 02:14:28.430
<v Speaker 4>and for some of them I was more like a crazy uncle than a big brother.</v>

4440
02:14:28.431 --> 02:14:33.170
<v Speaker 4>But this review that I read of your podcast was describing you as big brother to</v>

4441
02:14:33.171 --> 02:14:34.004
<v Speaker 4>your audience.</v>

4442
02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:36.080
<v Speaker 4>And I think in that capacity,</v>

4443
02:14:36.530 --> 02:14:37.820
<v Speaker 4>being able to</v>

4444
02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:38.701
<v Speaker 2>share,</v>

4445
02:14:38.701 --> 02:14:39.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4446
02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:40.370
<v Speaker 2>this vision at least and,</v>

4447
02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:41.360
<v Speaker 2>and well,</v>

4448
02:14:41.370 --> 02:14:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I think the problem is when you start calling to revolution,</v>

4449
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.891
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

4450
02:14:43.891 --> 02:14:47.760
<v Speaker 2>because then people could sell illusion because it's an evolution grandizing is</v>

4451
02:14:47.761 --> 02:14:51.900
<v Speaker 2>that what we agreed becomes that it becomes that you call it whatever love,</v>

4452
02:14:51.901 --> 02:14:52.351
<v Speaker 2>aleutian.</v>

4453
02:14:52.351 --> 02:14:52.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

4454
02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:53.051
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4455
02:14:53.051 --> 02:14:54.510
<v Speaker 2>you define yourself as a movement.</v>

4456
02:14:54.790 --> 02:14:56.450
<v Speaker 2>This is come join the movement.</v>

4457
02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:57.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm not already in the movement.</v>

4458
02:14:58.800 --> 02:14:59.580
<v Speaker 2>I think you already are.</v>

4459
02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:00.450
<v Speaker 2>How my joint things,</v>

4460
02:15:00.451 --> 02:15:01.230
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying,</v>

4461
02:15:01.230 --> 02:15:02.070
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I'm saying.</v>

4462
02:15:02.071 --> 02:15:02.821
<v Speaker 2>Like all of a sudden like,</v>

4463
02:15:02.821 --> 02:15:03.151
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4464
02:15:03.151 --> 02:15:03.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm in.</v>

4465
02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4466
02:15:04.550 --> 02:15:04.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4467
02:15:04.850 --> 02:15:06.150
<v Speaker 2>then then we become a move out.</v>

4468
02:15:06.151 --> 02:15:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Self identification.</v>

4469
02:15:07.230 --> 02:15:07.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4470
02:15:07.651 --> 02:15:08.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's necessary.</v>

4471
02:15:08.701 --> 02:15:13.701
<v Speaker 2>I think what we are is human beings that understand that our system is not</v>

4472
02:15:15.241 --> 02:15:17.550
<v Speaker 2>correct and to call ourselves a revolution,</v>

4473
02:15:17.730 --> 02:15:20.160
<v Speaker 2>to call ourselves anything other than just human beings.</v>

4474
02:15:20.161 --> 02:15:21.000
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pointless.</v>

4475
02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:22.950
<v Speaker 2>I think it's rational thinking.</v>

4476
02:15:22.951 --> 02:15:23.521
<v Speaker 2>Human beings.</v>

4477
02:15:23.521 --> 02:15:25.020
<v Speaker 2>It realize there's something wrong here.</v>

4478
02:15:25.110 --> 02:15:28.770
<v Speaker 2>And that includes the people in the system that includes cops,</v>

4479
02:15:28.860 --> 02:15:30.090
<v Speaker 2>that includes judges,</v>

4480
02:15:30.150 --> 02:15:31.230
<v Speaker 2>that includes lawyers,</v>

4481
02:15:31.231 --> 02:15:34.470
<v Speaker 2>that includes everybody along the line that it's all equally eligible for</v>

4482
02:15:34.471 --> 02:15:35.304
<v Speaker 2>personal awakening.</v>

4483
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Every single one of them with the proper medication and the right setting could</v>

4484
02:15:39.901 --> 02:15:43.590
<v Speaker 2>see some shit that would make them rethink reality and it would make them humble</v>

4485
02:15:43.591 --> 02:15:47.310
<v Speaker 2>enough to at least understand that they don't know everything because they never</v>

4486
02:15:47.311 --> 02:15:48.450
<v Speaker 2>knew that that was there.</v>

4487
02:15:48.750 --> 02:15:49.291
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>

4488
02:15:49.291 --> 02:15:50.280
<v Speaker 2>you know everything.</v>

4489
02:15:50.281 --> 02:15:51.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking smart guy.</v>

4490
02:15:51.641 --> 02:15:52.710
<v Speaker 2>I was in my class.</v>

4491
02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:54.390
<v Speaker 2>I get you high on dmt.</v>

4492
02:15:54.391 --> 02:15:55.530
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you,</v>

4493
02:15:55.531 --> 02:16:00.300
<v Speaker 2>you will think about everything different for the rest of your life because you</v>

4494
02:16:00.301 --> 02:16:01.470
<v Speaker 2>didn't know that was there.</v>

4495
02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:06.000
<v Speaker 2>You didn't know that all you had to do was follow a few simple steps and you're</v>

4496
02:16:06.001 --> 02:16:09.000
<v Speaker 2>in a different land where everything is complex.</v>

4497
02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Geometric patterns made out of love and understanding that,</v>

4498
02:16:11.821 --> 02:16:11.881
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4499
02:16:11.881 --> 02:16:16.000
<v Speaker 2>communicating with you in some sort of a telekinetic language or telekinesis</v>

4500
02:16:16.170 --> 02:16:17.003
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>

4501
02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:21.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that you can really appreciate life unless you know that that's</v>

4502
02:16:21.481 --> 02:16:22.290
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

4503
02:16:22.290 --> 02:16:23.550
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know that that's there.</v>

4504
02:16:23.551 --> 02:16:27.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like you've lived three quarters of a life like you don't understand,</v>

4505
02:16:27.631 --> 02:16:32.140
<v Speaker 2>there's there's an is an experience and it only takes about 15 minutes and</v>

4506
02:16:32.141 --> 02:16:33.370
<v Speaker 2>you'll never be the same again,</v>

4507
02:16:33.460 --> 02:16:37.190
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to come back and you're going to be burdened with all your past</v>

4508
02:16:37.210 --> 02:16:40.360
<v Speaker 2>preconceived notions and ideas and all the things that you've learned from your</v>

4509
02:16:40.361 --> 02:16:40.660
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

4510
02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:42.670
<v Speaker 2>but you're essentially going to be a totally different person.</v>

4511
02:16:42.671 --> 02:16:46.570
<v Speaker 2>Now you're a person who can never Forget the things that you saw or the way that</v>

4512
02:16:46.571 --> 02:16:48.430
<v Speaker 2>you felt when you experienced that.</v>

4513
02:16:48.610 --> 02:16:48.731
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

4514
02:16:48.731 --> 02:16:51.970
<v Speaker 2>whether that's just your brain getting tweaked with chemicals or whether it</v>

4515
02:16:51.971 --> 02:16:55.300
<v Speaker 2>really is what it feels like because what it feels like is you're going to</v>

4516
02:16:55.301 --> 02:16:59.140
<v Speaker 2>another place and we just assumed that the only way to travel is to put one foot</v>

4517
02:16:59.141 --> 02:16:59.770
<v Speaker 2>in front of the other,</v>

4518
02:16:59.770 --> 02:17:00.311
<v Speaker 2>getting a car,</v>

4519
02:17:00.311 --> 02:17:01.600
<v Speaker 2>getting a plane with them.</v>

4520
02:17:01.630 --> 02:17:06.310
<v Speaker 2>you might be able to travel chemically between dimensions and that might be what</v>

4521
02:17:06.370 --> 02:17:08.410
<v Speaker 2>things like dmt are all about.</v>

4522
02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:11.680
<v Speaker 2>That might be why it's made by your own fucking brain.</v>

4523
02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:14.230
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4524
02:17:14.230 --> 02:17:15.063
<v Speaker 4>we should make.</v>

4525
02:17:15.330 --> 02:17:18.910
<v Speaker 4>That's why I probably just started sort of started this conversatIon by saying,</v>

4526
02:17:18.911 --> 02:17:19.091
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

4527
02:17:19.091 --> 02:17:22.510
<v Speaker 4>welcome to this thing that we're describing as a movement now because your deal,</v>

4528
02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:22.680
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4529
02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:24.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm being super hyper critical for no reason,</v>

4530
02:17:24.461 --> 02:17:24.741
<v Speaker 4>but you're,</v>

4531
02:17:24.741 --> 02:17:26.200
<v Speaker 4>you're already a part of this and I,</v>

4532
02:17:26.201 --> 02:17:26.511
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4533
02:17:26.511 --> 02:17:26.981
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

4534
02:17:26.981 --> 02:17:29.830
<v Speaker 4>the reason that so many people in my audience really appreciated this</v>

4535
02:17:29.831 --> 02:17:32.790
<v Speaker 4>conversation and like era anticipated it is because they,</v>

4536
02:17:32.791 --> 02:17:32.981
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

4537
02:17:32.981 --> 02:17:37.981
<v Speaker 4>they realize that you already carry this message in a way very powerfully in the</v>

4538
02:17:38.681 --> 02:17:40.960
<v Speaker 4>way that you talk about society and the way that you integrate it.</v>

4539
02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:44.170
<v Speaker 4>And what would I just want to do is that he does want to express my</v>

4540
02:17:44.171 --> 02:17:45.000
<v Speaker 4>appreciation.</v>

4541
02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:45.400
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

4542
02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:46.001
<v Speaker 4>Thank you very much.</v>

4543
02:17:46.001 --> 02:17:46.990
<v Speaker 4>but I think everybody does now.</v>

4544
02:17:46.991 --> 02:17:49.210
<v Speaker 4>I think we've reached a point where I think reached a point.</v>

4545
02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:50.093
<v Speaker 4>We're going to melt.</v>

4546
02:17:50.530 --> 02:17:53.350
<v Speaker 4>It's the fucking ac down there fixing her.</v>

4547
02:17:53.430 --> 02:17:53.650
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4548
02:17:53.650 --> 02:17:54.570
<v Speaker 2>so they shut it off.</v>

4549
02:17:54.970 --> 02:17:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Sons pitches a good.</v>

4550
02:17:57.781 --> 02:18:02.550
<v Speaker 2>We feel the heat of suppression that mother earth gives us and this oppression</v>

4551
02:18:02.551 --> 02:18:04.050
<v Speaker 2>will help us get through this podcast better.</v>

4552
02:18:04.530 --> 02:18:05.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4553
02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.551
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4554
02:18:05.551 --> 02:18:05.761
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4555
02:18:05.761 --> 02:18:07.260
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody's recognizing it now.</v>

4556
02:18:07.261 --> 02:18:09.630
<v Speaker 2>AnYbody with a brain is realizing,</v>

4557
02:18:09.770 --> 02:18:10.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4558
02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:13.710
<v Speaker 2>bush was the first guy where everybody had to step back and go,</v>

4559
02:18:13.711 --> 02:18:14.251
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

4560
02:18:14.251 --> 02:18:15.780
<v Speaker 2>like because of the access to information,</v>

4561
02:18:15.781 --> 02:18:18.060
<v Speaker 2>that was the first time we got real news,</v>

4562
02:18:18.180 --> 02:18:20.160
<v Speaker 2>daily news online and shit.</v>

4563
02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:22.200
<v Speaker 2>There was the first time people realize like,</v>

4564
02:18:22.201 --> 02:18:22.531
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

4565
02:18:22.531 --> 02:18:22.920
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

4566
02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:25.950
<v Speaker 2>this administration is bought and paid for like,</v>

4567
02:18:25.951 --> 02:18:27.240
<v Speaker 2>this is ridiculous.</v>

4568
02:18:27.241 --> 02:18:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Like this is the most obviously bought and paid like they're rocking it in a way</v>

4569
02:18:31.501 --> 02:18:32.820
<v Speaker 2>that nobody had previously done.</v>

4570
02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:37.320
<v Speaker 2>Everybody had been way slicker about hiding their connections to money into war</v>

4571
02:18:37.321 --> 02:18:38.154
<v Speaker 2>profiteering,</v>

4572
02:18:38.580 --> 02:18:41.580
<v Speaker 2>but the bush administration just let their freak flag fly.</v>

4573
02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.010
<v Speaker 2>They just fucking went out,</v>

4574
02:18:44.670 --> 02:18:45.810
<v Speaker 2>started to wars.</v>

4575
02:18:45.811 --> 02:18:46.950
<v Speaker 2>That made no sense.</v>

4576
02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Profited a fuck load of money.</v>

4577
02:18:49.230 --> 02:18:50.970
<v Speaker 2>if you could talk to George Bush,</v>

4578
02:18:51.150 --> 02:18:52.770
<v Speaker 2>what would that conversation be like?</v>

4579
02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:54.720
<v Speaker 2>If you could just get a loan with that guy,</v>

4580
02:18:54.721 --> 02:18:56.130
<v Speaker 2>would you do it respectfully?</v>

4581
02:18:56.340 --> 02:19:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Would you slowly try to chip away at it and try to get his perspective?</v>

4582
02:19:00.871 --> 02:19:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Or do you think you would just lose your fucking mind when you were just in the</v>

4583
02:19:03.721 --> 02:19:07.800
<v Speaker 2>face of someone who is at least indirectly responsible for the death of probably</v>

4584
02:19:07.801 --> 02:19:11.160
<v Speaker 2>a million people and from my own ptsd in a sense?</v>

4585
02:19:11.161 --> 02:19:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4586
02:19:11.730 --> 02:19:12.150
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

4587
02:19:12.150 --> 02:19:14.130
<v Speaker 2>And what would that be like to be in front of that guy?</v>

4588
02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:17.080
<v Speaker 4>That's a great question.</v>

4589
02:19:17.081 --> 02:19:17.381
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4590
02:19:17.381 --> 02:19:17.690
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

4591
02:19:17.690 --> 02:19:18.940
<v Speaker 4>and I used to,</v>

4592
02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:21.910
<v Speaker 4>when I was active with Iraq veterans against the war,</v>

4593
02:19:21.911 --> 02:19:24.850
<v Speaker 4>when I got out of the marines and was disgruntled and started questioning</v>

4594
02:19:24.851 --> 02:19:25.181
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

4595
02:19:25.181 --> 02:19:26.740
<v Speaker 4>I used to fantasize about that,</v>

4596
02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:29.110
<v Speaker 4>like a physical violent guy punch him in the face.</v>

4597
02:19:29.620 --> 02:19:31.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you should say that on the radio.</v>

4598
02:19:31.370 --> 02:19:32.750
<v Speaker 4>well this was like George Bush.</v>

4599
02:19:32.751 --> 02:19:33.030
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

4600
02:19:33.030 --> 02:19:34.130
<v Speaker 4>I think you can threaten them.</v>

4601
02:19:34.260 --> 02:19:35.270
<v Speaker 4>A past president.</v>

4602
02:19:35.271 --> 02:19:36.440
<v Speaker 4>I think you faked do that.</v>

4603
02:19:36.470 --> 02:19:37.010
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4604
02:19:37.010 --> 02:19:37.940
<v Speaker 4>but is that funny?</v>

4605
02:19:37.970 --> 02:19:38.870
<v Speaker 4>They get arrested for that.</v>

4606
02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:39.853
<v Speaker 4>I know I've,</v>

4607
02:19:41.170 --> 02:19:43.850
<v Speaker 4>I've had experiences but now you feel differently.</v>

4608
02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:44.630
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4609
02:19:44.630 --> 02:19:45.171
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4610
02:19:45.171 --> 02:19:50.171
<v Speaker 4>I think part of my own philosophical development and my own experience going</v>

4611
02:19:51.291 --> 02:19:54.620
<v Speaker 4>through to the point where I feel like I got to,</v>

4612
02:19:54.860 --> 02:19:55.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4613
02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:56.660
<v Speaker 4>you never get all the way to the bottom,</v>

4614
02:19:56.661 --> 02:19:59.390
<v Speaker 4>but like to the effective bottom of the rabbit hole for me where I,</v>

4615
02:19:59.450 --> 02:20:02.000
<v Speaker 4>that allows me to function the way that I do now with the,</v>

4616
02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:03.650
<v Speaker 4>my current understanding of the world.</v>

4617
02:20:04.460 --> 02:20:04.821
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4618
02:20:04.821 --> 02:20:08.140
<v Speaker 4>part of It was having a philosophical approach.</v>

4619
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:11.390
<v Speaker 4>There's a quote from a buddhist monk,</v>

4620
02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:13.761
<v Speaker 4>thich nhat hahn,</v>

4621
02:20:13.761 --> 02:20:15.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure I'm butchering the name,</v>

4622
02:20:15.111 --> 02:20:18.050
<v Speaker 4>but it's something like when someone does harm to you,</v>

4623
02:20:18.500 --> 02:20:22.040
<v Speaker 4>it is only because harm has been done to them and they are reflecting it back</v>

4624
02:20:22.041 --> 02:20:22.980
<v Speaker 4>and they are expressing and,</v>

4625
02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:23.240
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4626
02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:24.073
<v Speaker 4>and to me,</v>

4627
02:20:24.260 --> 02:20:28.400
<v Speaker 4>I see that that is what government as a whole is in the sense that it's</v>

4628
02:20:28.401 --> 02:20:29.480
<v Speaker 4>pathological behavior.</v>

4629
02:20:29.481 --> 02:20:32.060
<v Speaker 4>It is a relic of human evolution,</v>

4630
02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:34.060
<v Speaker 4>of the scarring of the.</v>

4631
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:37.700
<v Speaker 4>The only way we were able to raise kids in the state of nature was you'll beat</v>

4632
02:20:37.701 --> 02:20:37.821
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

4633
02:20:37.821 --> 02:20:41.930
<v Speaker 4>So they keep up with the tribe and the evolution of that into government.</v>

4634
02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:45.290
<v Speaker 4>And I see that as a George Bush,</v>

4635
02:20:45.291 --> 02:20:50.291
<v Speaker 4>simply a representation of that broader social phenomenon of government being</v>

4636
02:20:50.991 --> 02:20:55.340
<v Speaker 4>the last manifestation of this desire to control and dominate and use violence</v>

4637
02:20:55.341 --> 02:20:55.880
<v Speaker 4>against others.</v>

4638
02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:56.713
<v Speaker 4>And so it,</v>

4639
02:20:57.120 --> 02:20:57.440
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4640
02:20:57.440 --> 02:21:00.200
<v Speaker 4>and it's not that the president is a pitch man or a puppet,</v>

4641
02:21:00.650 --> 02:21:01.730
<v Speaker 4>he's a power broker,</v>

4642
02:21:01.731 --> 02:21:01.941
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4643
02:21:01.941 --> 02:21:03.380
<v Speaker 4>he legitimately makes decisions,</v>

4644
02:21:03.381 --> 02:21:04.460
<v Speaker 4>but the reason,</v>

4645
02:21:04.461 --> 02:21:07.100
<v Speaker 4>the one who usually gets into the position as the one that is,</v>

4646
02:21:07.101 --> 02:21:10.100
<v Speaker 4>is because he's reflective of the environment that produces them.</v>

4647
02:21:10.101 --> 02:21:11.930
<v Speaker 4>And that's the existing power structure.</v>

4648
02:21:11.931 --> 02:21:13.880
<v Speaker 4>And that's the paradigm of society as a whole.</v>

4649
02:21:13.881 --> 02:21:18.200
<v Speaker 4>And that's why changing the paradigm and waking people up and the perspective</v>

4650
02:21:18.201 --> 02:21:21.710
<v Speaker 4>that you share about government is so powerful because what ultimately</v>

4651
02:21:21.711 --> 02:21:25.220
<v Speaker 4>determines whether or not you are going to be free is whether the human beings</v>

4652
02:21:25.221 --> 02:21:28.370
<v Speaker 4>around you agree that you should be free and they won't tolerate people</v>

4653
02:21:28.371 --> 02:21:30.650
<v Speaker 4>initiating force against you when you're acting peacefully.</v>

4654
02:21:31.610 --> 02:21:33.590
<v Speaker 4>So the only way to do that is to make them happier.</v>

4655
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:34.300
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

4656
02:21:34.300 --> 02:21:35.240
<v Speaker 4>that's the real trick,</v>

4657
02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:37.460
<v Speaker 4>to get them to lighten the fuck up.</v>

4658
02:21:37.490 --> 02:21:38.420
<v Speaker 4>Things are not that bad.</v>

4659
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:39.360
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4660
02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:41.420
<v Speaker 4>you really look in perspective,</v>

4661
02:21:41.450 --> 02:21:42.440
<v Speaker 4>things are not that Bad,</v>

4662
02:21:42.590 --> 02:21:45.980
<v Speaker 4>but one of my biggest philosophical influences is stefan molyneux and he went</v>

4663
02:21:45.981 --> 02:21:48.170
<v Speaker 4>through a whole process of describing this anarcho,</v>

4664
02:21:48.171 --> 02:21:48.681
<v Speaker 4>capitalist,</v>

4665
02:21:48.681 --> 02:21:49.760
<v Speaker 4>ideal society and,</v>

4666
02:21:49.761 --> 02:21:51.890
<v Speaker 4>and really to embrace this philosophy,</v>

4667
02:21:51.891 --> 02:21:56.660
<v Speaker 4>you kind of have to go through all of the resistances that people have like</v>

4668
02:21:57.440 --> 02:21:58.370
<v Speaker 4>without government,</v>

4669
02:21:58.371 --> 02:21:59.600
<v Speaker 4>who's going to build the roads,</v>

4670
02:21:59.601 --> 02:22:00.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4671
02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:02.130
<v Speaker 4>and it's the same question as,</v>

4672
02:22:02.131 --> 02:22:05.810
<v Speaker 4>as people would ask when we were trying to abolish slavery and it was,</v>

4673
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:07.100
<v Speaker 4>but without the slaves,</v>

4674
02:22:07.101 --> 02:22:08.350
<v Speaker 4>who's going to pick the content?</v>

4675
02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:10.490
<v Speaker 4>Is anything wrong with having a form of council,</v>

4676
02:22:10.700 --> 02:22:11.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4677
02:22:11.150 --> 02:22:12.990
<v Speaker 4>the idea of calling them government and like,</v>

4678
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:15.620
<v Speaker 4>like what the obama administration was able to do,</v>

4679
02:22:15.621 --> 02:22:20.000
<v Speaker 4>what the obama administration was able to do in this whole operation fast and</v>

4680
02:22:20.001 --> 02:22:20.834
<v Speaker 4>furious.</v>

4681
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:22.010
<v Speaker 4>Or hE was able to,</v>

4682
02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:22.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4683
02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:24.920
<v Speaker 4>just say I don't want to talk about it and why,</v>

4684
02:22:24.990 --> 02:22:26.340
<v Speaker 4>what does it invoking executive</v>

4685
02:22:26.340 --> 02:22:28.230
<v Speaker 5>order or whatever executive privilege.</v>

4686
02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:28.741
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4687
02:22:28.741 --> 02:22:29.574
<v Speaker 5>how silly is that?</v>

4688
02:22:29.580 --> 02:22:30.413
<v Speaker 5>You just let it.</v>

4689
02:22:30.420 --> 02:22:34.290
<v Speaker 5>There's a giant scandal where they sold guns to mexican drug dealers and they</v>

4690
02:22:34.291 --> 02:22:34.441
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

4691
02:22:34.441 --> 02:22:34.701
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

4692
02:22:34.701 --> 02:22:34.891
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4693
02:22:34.891 --> 02:22:35.910
<v Speaker 5>we're just going to track them.</v>

4694
02:22:36.420 --> 02:22:38.430
<v Speaker 5>One of those guns justify getting hold.</v>

4695
02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:41.780
<v Speaker 5>One of those guns killed one of the petroleum.</v>

4696
02:22:41.910 --> 02:22:42.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4697
02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:47.360
<v Speaker 5>like the idea that he would be able to use executive privilege and get out of</v>

4698
02:22:47.521 --> 02:22:50.580
<v Speaker 5>that and to do it so blatantly like that.</v>

4699
02:22:50.581 --> 02:22:51.480
<v Speaker 5>That's a creepy thing.</v>

4700
02:22:51.481 --> 02:22:52.920
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't have things like that.</v>

4701
02:22:52.980 --> 02:22:53.790
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4702
02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:55.140
<v Speaker 5>That kind of shit like that,</v>

4703
02:22:55.340 --> 02:22:55.861
<v Speaker 5>but that's what I'm saying.</v>

4704
02:22:55.861 --> 02:22:57.330
<v Speaker 5>Like in accounting for of council,</v>

4705
02:22:57.420 --> 02:22:59.700
<v Speaker 5>that would never exist in a form of dictatorship.</v>

4706
02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:01.980
<v Speaker 5>That's where something like that to get out of jail free.</v>

4707
02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:06.120
<v Speaker 5>It's what do you think that you need government to accomplish and how you do it</v>

4708
02:23:06.420 --> 02:23:07.750
<v Speaker 5>instead of having an arbitrage?</v>

4709
02:23:07.860 --> 02:23:09.210
<v Speaker 5>We'd like leaders and the lead,</v>

4710
02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:10.620
<v Speaker 5>but I think the leadership,</v>

4711
02:23:10.670 --> 02:23:11.640
<v Speaker 5>the anti political,</v>

4712
02:23:11.641 --> 02:23:12.630
<v Speaker 5>it's anti leaders.</v>

4713
02:23:12.631 --> 02:23:12.790
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

4714
02:23:12.790 --> 02:23:13.450
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4715
02:23:13.450 --> 02:23:13.651
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4716
02:23:13.651 --> 02:23:14.760
<v Speaker 5>it's anti-authoritarian.</v>

4717
02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:17.790
<v Speaker 5>It's saying we're not going to allow ourselves to be cowed.</v>

4718
02:23:17.791 --> 02:23:20.910
<v Speaker 5>We are going to understand that as human beings and what we call the free</v>

4719
02:23:20.911 --> 02:23:21.540
<v Speaker 5>market,</v>

4720
02:23:21.540 --> 02:23:24.990
<v Speaker 5>we are able to cooperatively accomplish all the things that we've been convinced</v>

4721
02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:26.670
<v Speaker 5>we need government for.</v>

4722
02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:27.001
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4723
02:23:27.001 --> 02:23:27.870
<v Speaker 5>I understand that,</v>

4724
02:23:27.871 --> 02:23:29.980
<v Speaker 5>but someone's gonna have to execute decision.</v>

4725
02:23:29.981 --> 02:23:31.710
<v Speaker 5>Someone's gonna have to put things in motion.</v>

4726
02:23:31.870 --> 02:23:34.230
<v Speaker 5>He going to have to a group code examples.</v>

4727
02:23:34.231 --> 02:23:35.640
<v Speaker 5>what is the thing that needs to get done,</v>

4728
02:23:35.641 --> 02:23:39.840
<v Speaker 5>whether you know it might not have a consensus of how many cops need to be hired</v>

4729
02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:43.460
<v Speaker 5>as opposed to how many teachers need to be hired and how much they should get</v>

4730
02:23:43.470 --> 02:23:44.730
<v Speaker 5>people paying for those services.</v>

4731
02:23:44.790 --> 02:23:45.421
<v Speaker 5>How do they do that?</v>

4732
02:23:45.421 --> 02:23:46.410
<v Speaker 5>They do that wIth a form of government.</v>

4733
02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:46.951
<v Speaker 5>They get together,</v>

4734
02:23:46.951 --> 02:23:47.784
<v Speaker 5>they have council,</v>

4735
02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:49.140
<v Speaker 5>they do it through corporations.</v>

4736
02:23:49.141 --> 02:23:52.110
<v Speaker 5>They do it through companies where they able to buy protection services where</v>

4737
02:23:52.111 --> 02:23:56.190
<v Speaker 5>they're able to get the the the legitimate services that police provide without</v>

4738
02:23:56.191 --> 02:23:59.910
<v Speaker 5>forcing it on people just because they happen to even teachers meet.</v>

4739
02:23:59.911 --> 02:24:03.360
<v Speaker 5>Even deciding what salaries are you going to have to have some sort of a way</v>

4740
02:24:03.361 --> 02:24:05.700
<v Speaker 5>that people can interact with each other and someone's going to have to execute</v>

4741
02:24:05.701 --> 02:24:05.790
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

4742
02:24:05.790 --> 02:24:06.720
<v Speaker 5>That's called the free market,</v>

4743
02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:10.920
<v Speaker 5>but that person who executes it should be someone who respected council,</v>

4744
02:24:10.921 --> 02:24:11.770
<v Speaker 5>someone who knows you.</v>

4745
02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:16.020
<v Speaker 5>Take advantage of the fact that why are people doing their jobs jobs,</v>

4746
02:24:16.021 --> 02:24:16.950
<v Speaker 5>the ceo of apple.</v>

4747
02:24:18.310 --> 02:24:18.590
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

4748
02:24:18.590 --> 02:24:19.170
<v Speaker 5>What book?</v>

4749
02:24:19.170 --> 02:24:20.940
<v Speaker 5>What made steve jobs the ceo of apple,</v>

4750
02:24:20.941 --> 02:24:23.430
<v Speaker 5>very creatIve guy started off market forces.</v>

4751
02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:28.140
<v Speaker 5>He was the most valuable one to be in the command of those market resources,</v>

4752
02:24:28.141 --> 02:24:31.200
<v Speaker 5>so you want to turn the government and how things run into it.</v>

4753
02:24:31.201 --> 02:24:33.090
<v Speaker 5>Just a big free market as far as police,</v>

4754
02:24:33.091 --> 02:24:34.110
<v Speaker 5>as far as teachers,</v>

4755
02:24:34.111 --> 02:24:35.210
<v Speaker 5>everything's just a giant freedom.</v>

4756
02:24:35.220 --> 02:24:36.510
<v Speaker 5>I want to take the violence out of.</v>

4757
02:24:36.511 --> 02:24:37.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to take the coercion now.</v>

4758
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:40.380
<v Speaker 5>You don't want it to be accomplished peacefully by people cooperating.</v>

4759
02:24:40.381 --> 02:24:41.214
<v Speaker 5>Instead of saying,</v>

4760
02:24:41.250 --> 02:24:41.461
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4761
02:24:41.461 --> 02:24:41.641
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4762
02:24:41.641 --> 02:24:42.151
<v Speaker 5>you live here,</v>

4763
02:24:42.151 --> 02:24:43.140
<v Speaker 5>you're going to pay these taxes.</v>

4764
02:24:43.141 --> 02:24:43.291
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4765
02:24:43.291 --> 02:24:43.411
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4766
02:24:43.411 --> 02:24:43.891
<v Speaker 5>you live here.</v>

4767
02:24:43.891 --> 02:24:45.330
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be under someone's gonna.</v>

4768
02:24:45.331 --> 02:24:48.330
<v Speaker 5>Have to organize how the hospital gets kept up.</v>

4769
02:24:48.331 --> 02:24:50.580
<v Speaker 5>Is that going to be a public thing or is that going to be.</v>

4770
02:24:50.581 --> 02:24:54.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean you opposed to everything will look at how much more public space station</v>

4771
02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:55.410
<v Speaker 5>are you opposed to public.</v>

4772
02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:58.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm opposed to education that's funded by violence.</v>

4773
02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:01.091
<v Speaker 5>How was it founded?</v>

4774
02:25:01.091 --> 02:25:01.570
<v Speaker 5>By allowance?</v>

4775
02:25:01.570 --> 02:25:02.403
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean by that?</v>

4776
02:25:03.050 --> 02:25:06.530
<v Speaker 5>You think a child going to school doesn't understand that if they don't go to</v>

4777
02:25:06.531 --> 02:25:07.250
<v Speaker 5>school everyday,</v>

4778
02:25:07.250 --> 02:25:10.600
<v Speaker 5>their parents get in trouble and that the way the school is paid for by taxes</v>

4779
02:25:10.610 --> 02:25:12.530
<v Speaker 5>that the parents pay against their will.</v>

4780
02:25:12.531 --> 02:25:14.600
<v Speaker 5>Whether or not they have children in a school system,</v>

4781
02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:15.681
<v Speaker 5>children get that.</v>

4782
02:25:15.681 --> 02:25:17.030
<v Speaker 5>They understand that we grow up,</v>

4783
02:25:17.031 --> 02:25:17.600
<v Speaker 5>but this is this.</v>

4784
02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:18.730
<v Speaker 5>This is the status,</v>

4785
02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:21.170
<v Speaker 5>but that's one way way of looking at it.</v>

4786
02:25:21.171 --> 02:25:24.070
<v Speaker 5>It's also true that parents pay taxes</v>

4787
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:26.800
<v Speaker 2>in a very specific neighborhood because they know there's a good school system</v>

4788
02:25:26.801 --> 02:25:31.030
<v Speaker 2>in there and then they run rallies for the school system and they gather up</v>

4789
02:25:31.031 --> 02:25:31.900
<v Speaker 2>money and people don't,</v>

4790
02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:33.040
<v Speaker 2>and so that's also true.</v>

4791
02:25:33.041 --> 02:25:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I see that and so that in community schools as well,</v>

4792
02:25:35.460 --> 02:25:36.820
<v Speaker 2>that it's not always negative.</v>

4793
02:25:36.850 --> 02:25:37.061
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4794
02:25:37.061 --> 02:25:37.990
<v Speaker 2>That aspect of it,</v>

4795
02:25:37.991 --> 02:25:38.411
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

4796
02:25:38.411 --> 02:25:39.400
<v Speaker 2>is superior.</v>

4797
02:25:39.401 --> 02:25:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Is it not to the federal department of education coming into that community and</v>

4798
02:25:43.331 --> 02:25:46.000
<v Speaker 2>st now you're going to follow these testing standards in order to get these</v>

4799
02:25:46.001 --> 02:25:48.190
<v Speaker 2>funds and if you don't do what we say with this.</v>

4800
02:25:48.430 --> 02:25:48.991
<v Speaker 2>So I'm all.</v>

4801
02:25:48.991 --> 02:25:51.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it's nice that a careful community.</v>

4802
02:25:51.220 --> 02:25:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4803
02:25:51.790 --> 02:25:52.900
<v Speaker 2>You see that difference.</v>

4804
02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:55.390
<v Speaker 2>So that community should be determined not by people.</v>

4805
02:25:56.970 --> 02:25:57.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4806
02:25:57.191 --> 02:25:57.700
<v Speaker 2>what do you.</v>

4807
02:25:57.700 --> 02:25:58.510
<v Speaker 2>How is this,</v>

4808
02:25:58.510 --> 02:26:02.110
<v Speaker 2>how is the money paying the teachers?</v>

4809
02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:03.400
<v Speaker 2>How is that coming from violence?</v>

4810
02:26:03.401 --> 02:26:03.881
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

4811
02:26:03.881 --> 02:26:04.900
<v Speaker 2>How do you pay taxes?</v>

4812
02:26:05.290 --> 02:26:05.650
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>

4813
02:26:05.650 --> 02:26:06.970
<v Speaker 2>What happens if you don't pay taxes?</v>

4814
02:26:08.020 --> 02:26:09.850
<v Speaker 2>We're not contributing to society.</v>

4815
02:26:10.450 --> 02:26:11.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't think we should.</v>

4816
02:26:12.090 --> 02:26:16.420
<v Speaker 2>Tax says we are not contributing to wider to corruption.</v>

4817
02:26:16.450 --> 02:26:17.283
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>

4818
02:26:17.460 --> 02:26:18.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>

4819
02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:20.140
<v Speaker 2>So do you think that all taxes are bad?</v>

4820
02:26:20.141 --> 02:26:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that we should have no taxes?</v>

4821
02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Taxes are a moral.</v>

4822
02:26:23.290 --> 02:26:24.370
<v Speaker 2>All taxes are moral.</v>

4823
02:26:24.371 --> 02:26:27.130
<v Speaker 2>So how do we expect to pay for the city streets?</v>

4824
02:26:27.131 --> 02:26:30.720
<v Speaker 2>How do we expect to pay to maintain some sort of a,</v>

4825
02:26:30.721 --> 02:26:31.100
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

4826
02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:31.450
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

4827
02:26:31.450 --> 02:26:35.140
<v Speaker 2>a presence with police officers and fund them with cars?</v>

4828
02:26:35.141 --> 02:26:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Is it all just donations?</v>

4829
02:26:36.460 --> 02:26:36.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4830
02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:37.031
<v Speaker 2>it will.</v>

4831
02:26:37.031 --> 02:26:39.520
<v Speaker 2>This is the difference between what we have with government and what we already</v>

4832
02:26:39.521 --> 02:26:40.480
<v Speaker 2>have in the free market.</v>

4833
02:26:40.630 --> 02:26:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Do people pay for protection?</v>

4834
02:26:42.101 --> 02:26:42.291
<v Speaker 2>Then?</v>

4835
02:26:42.291 --> 02:26:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Does it become you can do it.</v>

4836
02:26:44.190 --> 02:26:44.831
<v Speaker 2>The community.</v>

4837
02:26:44.831 --> 02:26:45.910
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like a good idea.</v>

4838
02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:46.510
<v Speaker 2>You can do it.</v>

4839
02:26:46.510 --> 02:26:50.620
<v Speaker 2>The private cops that decided to not save you because you didn't pay for</v>

4840
02:26:50.621 --> 02:26:51.454
<v Speaker 2>protection.</v>

4841
02:26:51.610 --> 02:26:54.310
<v Speaker 2>The differences with them all You get is protection.</v>

4842
02:26:54.340 --> 02:26:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Whereas with the police today,</v>

4843
02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:56.950
<v Speaker 2>do we get protection?</v>

4844
02:26:56.951 --> 02:26:57.784
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you do.</v>

4845
02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:58.180
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4846
02:26:58.180 --> 02:26:59.013
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>

4847
02:26:59.230 --> 02:27:00.063
<v Speaker 2>Good cops.</v>

4848
02:27:00.380 --> 02:27:00.650
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

4849
02:27:00.650 --> 02:27:00.891
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

4850
02:27:00.891 --> 02:27:01.890
<v Speaker 2>there's good cops out there.</v>

4851
02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:02.141
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4852
02:27:02.141 --> 02:27:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Well what is not all bad?</v>

4853
02:27:03.390 --> 02:27:04.570
<v Speaker 2>All cops are not bad.</v>

4854
02:27:04.571 --> 02:27:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Just because some cops do a bunch of stupid shit and those guys in the video</v>

4855
02:27:07.781 --> 02:27:08.720
<v Speaker 2>with you are clearly bad.</v>

4856
02:27:08.721 --> 02:27:08.841
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4857
02:27:08.841 --> 02:27:09.490
<v Speaker 2>so wouldN't.</v>

4858
02:27:09.490 --> 02:27:11.290
<v Speaker 2>This is the mechanism by which you separate.</v>

4859
02:27:11.291 --> 02:27:12.610
<v Speaker 2>The good cops are on the bad cops.</v>

4860
02:27:12.730 --> 02:27:14.040
<v Speaker 2>There are the ones.</v>

4861
02:27:14.050 --> 02:27:14.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4862
02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:14.350
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4863
02:27:14.350 --> 02:27:17.500
<v Speaker 2>This is the mechanism by which you actually do it is you take the arbitrary</v>

4864
02:27:17.501 --> 02:27:18.880
<v Speaker 2>power of government away from them.</v>

4865
02:27:18.881 --> 02:27:20.170
<v Speaker 2>You make them serve the market.</v>

4866
02:27:20.171 --> 02:27:21.790
<v Speaker 2>You make them serve the people peacefully.</v>

4867
02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:25.750
<v Speaker 2>You make them convince you that their services are necessary,</v>

4868
02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:27.190
<v Speaker 2>not put a gun to your head and say,</v>

4869
02:27:27.191 --> 02:27:28.360
<v Speaker 2>if you don't pay our taxes,</v>

4870
02:27:28.361 --> 02:27:29.530
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get locked in a cage.</v>

4871
02:27:30.010 --> 02:27:30.401
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4872
02:27:30.401 --> 02:27:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I think that locking someone in jail for taxes is very unfortunate and it</v>

4873
02:27:35.111 --> 02:27:37.990
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make sense when you think about how many fucking gigantic corporations</v>

4874
02:27:37.991 --> 02:27:40.270
<v Speaker 2>have gone bankrupt and how much more that affected people.</v>

4875
02:27:40.271 --> 02:27:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Then You know one person who's not paying the little tiny slice of the military</v>

4876
02:27:44.021 --> 02:27:45.460
<v Speaker 2>industrial complex is pie,</v>

4877
02:27:45.820 --> 02:27:47.920
<v Speaker 2>but you should have to pay something.</v>

4878
02:27:47.921 --> 02:27:50.710
<v Speaker 2>It should make sense that you're getting something out of it and you should want</v>

4879
02:27:50.711 --> 02:27:51.544
<v Speaker 2>to contribute.</v>

4880
02:27:51.750 --> 02:27:54.640
<v Speaker 2>I live in a community and if everybody,</v>

4881
02:27:54.850 --> 02:27:55.720
<v Speaker 2>if everybody said,</v>

4882
02:27:55.721 --> 02:27:55.841
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4883
02:27:55.841 --> 02:27:56.250
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

4884
02:27:56.250 --> 02:27:57.880
<v Speaker 2>our streets are all fucked up,</v>

4885
02:27:57.881 --> 02:28:00.370
<v Speaker 2>but it mike gathered up all the names.</v>

4886
02:28:00.371 --> 02:28:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Everybody lives here and realize if we all just chip in $100,</v>

4887
02:28:04.331 --> 02:28:05.380
<v Speaker 2>we could fix this whole thing.</v>

4888
02:28:05.381 --> 02:28:07.570
<v Speaker 2>I think it's worth it for me for $100 gun.</v>

4889
02:28:07.630 --> 02:28:08.171
<v Speaker 2>And everybody goes,</v>

4890
02:28:08.171 --> 02:28:08.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4891
02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:09.540
<v Speaker 2>that would be beautiful.</v>

4892
02:28:09.550 --> 02:28:11.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about government.</v>

4893
02:28:11.051 --> 02:28:11.591
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

4894
02:28:11.591 --> 02:28:12.270
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly.</v>

4895
02:28:12.270 --> 02:28:14.520
<v Speaker 2>The technology allows us all the way.</v>

4896
02:28:14.521 --> 02:28:16.780
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have jobs if we didn't have responsibility,</v>

4897
02:28:16.781 --> 02:28:17.321
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

4898
02:28:17.321 --> 02:28:17.891
<v Speaker 2>careers,</v>

4899
02:28:17.891 --> 02:28:19.420
<v Speaker 2>if we didn't have things we had to think about all day.</v>

4900
02:28:19.421 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Instead you're running around out there trying to figure out how to pay</v>

4901
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:25.700
<v Speaker 4>the firemen and how to make sure that the cop tires are good and you know,</v>

4902
02:28:25.710 --> 02:28:27.050
<v Speaker 4>at a certain point in time,</v>

4903
02:28:27.051 --> 02:28:29.400
<v Speaker 4>how much micromanagement can you do in your community.</v>

4904
02:28:29.460 --> 02:28:30.293
<v Speaker 4>Why w w,</v>

4905
02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:31.520
<v Speaker 4>how is it for cable now?</v>

4906
02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:32.090
<v Speaker 4>Internet,</v>

4907
02:28:32.090 --> 02:28:33.130
<v Speaker 4>tv and your in your,</v>

4908
02:28:33.220 --> 02:28:33.740
<v Speaker 4>in your,</v>

4909
02:28:33.740 --> 02:28:34.431
<v Speaker 4>in your house.</v>

4910
02:28:34.431 --> 02:28:36.290
<v Speaker 4>How is it that you get that without government?</v>

4911
02:28:37.150 --> 02:28:37.640
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4912
02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:38.060
<v Speaker 4>so you.</v>

4913
02:28:38.060 --> 02:28:41.420
<v Speaker 4>But you proposed that for things that we think of as civil services,</v>

4914
02:28:41.421 --> 02:28:41.641
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4915
02:28:41.641 --> 02:28:42.560
<v Speaker 4>And he proposed that for like,</v>

4916
02:28:42.561 --> 02:28:43.510
<v Speaker 4>cops will look at it.</v>

4917
02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:47.290
<v Speaker 4>I just seen that kills tricky man hops.</v>

4918
02:28:47.390 --> 02:28:48.440
<v Speaker 4>That's mercenaries.</v>

4919
02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:49.790
<v Speaker 4>Think about what the fuck is going on.</v>

4920
02:28:49.791 --> 02:28:54.110
<v Speaker 4>And I ran right now the problem with mercenaries is that they do things that the</v>

4921
02:28:54.111 --> 02:28:55.190
<v Speaker 4>government funds them to do.</v>

4922
02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:56.630
<v Speaker 4>That the market would never support.</v>

4923
02:28:57.650 --> 02:28:58.470
<v Speaker 4>That ties.</v>

4924
02:28:58.470 --> 02:29:01.460
<v Speaker 4>People only won't only want cops to do legitimate things.</v>

4925
02:29:01.461 --> 02:29:04.820
<v Speaker 4>The only way that you have mercenaries doing things that are immoral is because</v>

4926
02:29:04.821 --> 02:29:06.440
<v Speaker 4>it's funded by government in the first place.</v>

4927
02:29:06.470 --> 02:29:06.651
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

4928
02:29:06.651 --> 02:29:07.880
<v Speaker 4>I can see that argued easily.</v>

4929
02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:08.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4930
02:29:08.440 --> 02:29:08.640
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

4931
02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:11.840
<v Speaker 4>if tHey don't have a specific set of rules and are only open to the market,</v>

4932
02:29:11.841 --> 02:29:14.810
<v Speaker 4>they're going to push as far as they possibly can to get things done.</v>

4933
02:29:14.990 --> 02:29:17.150
<v Speaker 4>And if they're dealing with businesses that have a lot of money,</v>

4934
02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:18.710
<v Speaker 4>they're going to do things that aren't legal.</v>

4935
02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:21.890
<v Speaker 4>But that's what would happen if you privatize the cops and that's a fact.</v>

4936
02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:23.360
<v Speaker 4>That's just how human beings are.</v>

4937
02:29:23.450 --> 02:29:26.420
<v Speaker 4>If you give them little loopholes and you allow them to figure out how to get</v>

4938
02:29:26.421 --> 02:29:27.254
<v Speaker 4>through those loopholes,</v>

4939
02:29:27.350 --> 02:29:29.810
<v Speaker 4>they're like rats on a sinking ship and they're going to pop out and they're</v>

4940
02:29:29.811 --> 02:29:30.621
<v Speaker 4>going to fuck things up.</v>

4941
02:29:30.621 --> 02:29:30.830
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4942
02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:31.461
<v Speaker 4>because the only,</v>

4943
02:29:31.461 --> 02:29:31.570
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

4944
02:29:31.570 --> 02:29:31.811
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

4945
02:29:31.811 --> 02:29:34.430
<v Speaker 4>you're basing that on an understanding of the corporate structure of the current</v>

4946
02:29:34.431 --> 02:29:37.670
<v Speaker 4>government paradigm where government empowers corporations to have an unnatural</v>

4947
02:29:37.671 --> 02:29:39.950
<v Speaker 4>advantage in the market and protect them from competition.</v>

4948
02:29:39.950 --> 02:29:40.910
<v Speaker 4>So cops,</v>

4949
02:29:40.940 --> 02:29:41.300
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4950
02:29:41.300 --> 02:29:41.631
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>

4951
02:29:41.631 --> 02:29:41.751
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4952
02:29:41.751 --> 02:29:41.900
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

4953
02:29:41.900 --> 02:29:42.541
<v Speaker 4>In your scenario,</v>

4954
02:29:42.541 --> 02:29:42.831
<v Speaker 4>you say,</v>

4955
02:29:42.831 --> 02:29:46.610
<v Speaker 4>rich people like existing corporations and concentrations of wealth would abuse</v>

4956
02:29:46.611 --> 02:29:50.750
<v Speaker 4>this ability to hire police forces and private whatever to be able to do evil</v>

4957
02:29:50.751 --> 02:29:51.021
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

4958
02:29:51.021 --> 02:29:51.141
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4959
02:29:51.141 --> 02:29:51.501
<v Speaker 4>guess what?</v>

4960
02:29:51.501 --> 02:29:52.334
<v Speaker 4>They already can.</v>

4961
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:55.550
<v Speaker 4>The thing iS what we have is a government that keeps the rest of us from doing</v>

4962
02:29:55.551 --> 02:29:56.384
<v Speaker 4>the same thing.</v>

4963
02:29:56.480 --> 02:29:59.990
<v Speaker 4>From being able to say that our demands for community safety services,</v>

4964
02:29:59.991 --> 02:30:01.910
<v Speaker 4>our demands are being met by the market,</v>

4965
02:30:01.911 --> 02:30:03.470
<v Speaker 4>not by a monopoly that's forced on us.</v>

4966
02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:05.720
<v Speaker 4>This is why this is the premise of the drug war man.</v>

4967
02:30:05.930 --> 02:30:06.441
<v Speaker 4>You do this.</v>

4968
02:30:06.441 --> 02:30:07.490
<v Speaker 4>The drug war goes away.</v>

4969
02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:08.151
<v Speaker 4>You do this.</v>

4970
02:30:08.151 --> 02:30:12.500
<v Speaker 4>All unjust laws go away because the demands on the enforcers are the demands of</v>

4971
02:30:12.501 --> 02:30:13.071
<v Speaker 4>the market there.</v>

4972
02:30:13.071 --> 02:30:14.330
<v Speaker 4>What people actually want.</v>

4973
02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:16.670
<v Speaker 4>The bad cops go away because you get to fiRe them.</v>

4974
02:30:16.671 --> 02:30:21.170
<v Speaker 4>There's no police unions that say you can't fire people and there's going to be</v>

4975
02:30:21.171 --> 02:30:23.990
<v Speaker 4>a law against this that if a cop shoots somebody,</v>

4976
02:30:24.110 --> 02:30:25.400
<v Speaker 4>he's going to get paid leave.</v>

4977
02:30:25.420 --> 02:30:26.510
<v Speaker 4>You know that kind of bullshit.</v>

4978
02:30:26.690 --> 02:30:28.640
<v Speaker 4>All of that goes away when you have roads.</v>

4979
02:30:28.641 --> 02:30:31.610
<v Speaker 4>Like I was telling you the way that they're holding us back from technological</v>

4980
02:30:31.611 --> 02:30:32.091
<v Speaker 4>development,</v>

4981
02:30:32.091 --> 02:30:35.360
<v Speaker 4>but specifically like in New Mexico where the speaker of the house gets to just</v>

4982
02:30:35.361 --> 02:30:35.451
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

4983
02:30:35.451 --> 02:30:35.601
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4984
02:30:35.601 --> 02:30:37.250
<v Speaker 4>put that intersection by my land.</v>

4985
02:30:37.430 --> 02:30:38.750
<v Speaker 4>so the value of it goes up.</v>

4986
02:30:38.900 --> 02:30:39.920
<v Speaker 4>All of that goes away.</v>

4987
02:30:40.130 --> 02:30:40.671
<v Speaker 4>And to say that,</v>

4988
02:30:40.671 --> 02:30:40.821
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4989
02:30:40.821 --> 02:30:42.980
<v Speaker 4>we need corruption goes away.</v>

4990
02:30:43.220 --> 02:30:43.640
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4991
02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:44.630
<v Speaker 4>How does corruption go away?</v>

4992
02:30:44.990 --> 02:30:49.070
<v Speaker 4>Because it's in order to make money in the free market and this is the free</v>

4993
02:30:49.071 --> 02:30:49.401
<v Speaker 4>market.</v>

4994
02:30:49.401 --> 02:30:50.660
<v Speaker 4>Makes corruption go with will.</v>

4995
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:51.583
<v Speaker 4>Hold on a second.</v>

4996
02:30:51.670 --> 02:30:51.870
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

4997
02:30:51.870 --> 02:30:52.050
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4998
02:30:52.050 --> 02:30:55.370
<v Speaker 4>the capitalist ideal is that it's free individuals,</v>

4999
02:30:55.371 --> 02:30:59.600
<v Speaker 4>multiple parties are able to engage in trade because it mutual is a mutual</v>

5000
02:30:59.601 --> 02:31:00.051
<v Speaker 4>benefit,</v>

5001
02:31:00.051 --> 02:31:00.570
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5002
02:31:00.570 --> 02:31:01.140
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

5003
02:31:01.140 --> 02:31:01.973
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5004
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:02.691
<v Speaker 4>I give you something,</v>

5005
02:31:02.691 --> 02:31:03.351
<v Speaker 4>you give me something.</v>

5006
02:31:03.351 --> 02:31:04.910
<v Speaker 4>We both believe that we're better off from it.</v>

5007
02:31:04.911 --> 02:31:07.700
<v Speaker 4>This is the basic concept of capitalism,</v>

5008
02:31:07.701 --> 02:31:08.534
<v Speaker 4>of free trade,</v>

5009
02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:13.610
<v Speaker 4>of application of yourself as a capital resource engaged in the free market and</v>

5010
02:31:13.730 --> 02:31:15.860
<v Speaker 4>anytime you introduce coercion into that,</v>

5011
02:31:16.160 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 4>you take away from our ideal potential as humanity to engage</v>

5012
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:20.813
<v Speaker 5>in commerce.</v>

5013
02:31:21.090 --> 02:31:21.923
<v Speaker 5>No argument with that.</v>

5014
02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:23.250
<v Speaker 5>So that's what government does.</v>

5015
02:31:23.251 --> 02:31:24.150
<v Speaker 5>And so if you had,</v>

5016
02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:28.800
<v Speaker 5>if you had the ability now is we do technologically obviously to pool resources</v>

5017
02:31:28.801 --> 02:31:29.070
<v Speaker 5>to come.</v>

5018
02:31:29.070 --> 02:31:30.750
<v Speaker 5>You're saying you're calling government,</v>

5019
02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:31.251
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

5020
02:31:31.251 --> 02:31:33.480
<v Speaker 5>you're defining human nature as government.</v>

5021
02:31:33.930 --> 02:31:35.250
<v Speaker 5>You're saying anybody with power,</v>

5022
02:31:35.251 --> 02:31:36.390
<v Speaker 5>you defining that as government?</v>

5023
02:31:36.540 --> 02:31:36.751
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5024
02:31:36.751 --> 02:31:39.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying that would happen in your private top system too,</v>

5025
02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:40.290
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5026
02:31:40.290 --> 02:31:40.531
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5027
02:31:40.531 --> 02:31:40.710
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5028
02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:41.300
<v Speaker 5>probably wouldn't work.</v>

5029
02:31:41.300 --> 02:31:41.810
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

5030
02:31:41.810 --> 02:31:45.740
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying is that government is the current manifestation of human desire</v>

5031
02:31:45.741 --> 02:31:47.530
<v Speaker 5>to control and dominate others by forest.</v>

5032
02:31:48.030 --> 02:31:48.960
<v Speaker 5>This is the preMise.</v>

5033
02:31:48.961 --> 02:31:50.790
<v Speaker 5>So that's the only way to govern what you're saying.</v>

5034
02:31:50.820 --> 02:31:50.941
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5035
02:31:50.941 --> 02:31:54.210
<v Speaker 5>the only way to cover this definition of governing and without that it's</v>

5036
02:31:54.211 --> 02:31:56.670
<v Speaker 5>impossible to have like a compassionate leadership.</v>

5037
02:31:56.671 --> 02:31:57.510
<v Speaker 5>It's impossible.</v>

5038
02:31:57.540 --> 02:31:57.701
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5039
02:31:57.701 --> 02:31:59.750
<v Speaker 5>with that you have cooperation,</v>

5040
02:31:59.760 --> 02:32:01.980
<v Speaker 5>you have leadership of people that are doing good work.</v>

5041
02:32:01.981 --> 02:32:03.420
<v Speaker 5>So that's a government know.</v>

5042
02:32:03.810 --> 02:32:05.200
<v Speaker 5>What is the leadership then if there's,</v>

5043
02:32:05.840 --> 02:32:07.860
<v Speaker 5>if there's a leadership that you've got a government,</v>

5044
02:32:08.130 --> 02:32:09.360
<v Speaker 5>if you've got someone who's leading,</v>

5045
02:32:09.361 --> 02:32:10.194
<v Speaker 5>you've got a government.</v>

5046
02:32:10.230 --> 02:32:11.180
<v Speaker 5>So you've got another government,</v>

5047
02:32:11.181 --> 02:32:12.200
<v Speaker 5>you got to benevolent government.</v>

5048
02:32:12.210 --> 02:32:14.370
<v Speaker 5>Steve jobs was in a leader in the technological field.</v>

5049
02:32:14.371 --> 02:32:16.860
<v Speaker 5>I think steve jobs was a general of apple.</v>

5050
02:32:16.890 --> 02:32:17.371
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

5051
02:32:17.371 --> 02:32:17.970
<v Speaker 5>So was he,</v>

5052
02:32:17.970 --> 02:32:18.803
<v Speaker 5>was he government?</v>

5053
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.800
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

5054
02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:20.551
<v Speaker 5>Absolute jobs.</v>

5055
02:32:20.551 --> 02:32:21.450
<v Speaker 5>Was government for sure.</v>

5056
02:32:21.451 --> 02:32:23.210
<v Speaker 5>If you were involved with that,</v>

5057
02:32:23.230 --> 02:32:25.980
<v Speaker 5>finding government involved with apple and you left your phone,</v>

5058
02:32:26.040 --> 02:32:26.460
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>They fucking storm troopers house with machine guns.</v>

5065
02:32:37.320 --> 02:32:41.170
<v Speaker 5>Looked everywhere for the iphone then that mean is that not like government</v>

5066
02:32:41.171 --> 02:32:41.620
<v Speaker 5>would do?</v>

5067
02:32:41.620 --> 02:32:42.750
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly what the government would do.</v>

5068
02:32:42.751 --> 02:32:43.710
<v Speaker 5>And then they fire the guy.</v>

5069
02:32:43.860 --> 02:32:45.210
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly what the government would do.</v>

5070
02:32:45.240 --> 02:32:45.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5071
02:32:45.550 --> 02:32:47.130
<v Speaker 5>So I'd say steve jobs was the government.</v>

5072
02:32:47.490 --> 02:32:47.851
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

5073
02:32:47.851 --> 02:32:48.684
<v Speaker 5>well then then we're,</v>

5074
02:32:48.820 --> 02:32:50.250
<v Speaker 5>we're still sort of talking about.</v>

5075
02:32:50.270 --> 02:32:51.720
<v Speaker 5>And that is a corporation.</v>

5076
02:32:51.721 --> 02:32:53.190
<v Speaker 5>I mean that is the real free market.</v>

5077
02:32:53.191 --> 02:32:55.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean the corporation is the village of apple.</v>

5078
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.770
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5079
02:32:55.770 --> 02:32:58.470
<v Speaker 5>But you're throwing up these objections that are,</v>

5080
02:32:58.471 --> 02:33:00.940
<v Speaker 5>that are just objections are totally not objective.</v>

5081
02:33:01.050 --> 02:33:01.700
<v Speaker 5>These are all,</v>

5082
02:33:01.700 --> 02:33:04.530
<v Speaker 5>this is all just a devil's advocate,</v>

5083
02:33:04.531 --> 02:33:04.941
<v Speaker 5>but then it's an,</v>

5084
02:33:04.941 --> 02:33:06.060
<v Speaker 5>it's an important thing to say.</v>

5085
02:33:06.061 --> 02:33:07.050
<v Speaker 5>but like I said,</v>

5086
02:33:07.051 --> 02:33:09.990
<v Speaker 5>when when you were living under slavery and someone said,</v>

5087
02:33:09.991 --> 02:33:10.141
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

5088
02:33:10.141 --> 02:33:11.280
<v Speaker 5>we need to end slavery.</v>

5089
02:33:11.410 --> 02:33:11.620
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

5090
02:33:11.620 --> 02:33:11.850
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

5091
02:33:11.850 --> 02:33:13.530
<v Speaker 5>the devil's advocate was saying,</v>

5092
02:33:13.770 --> 02:33:15.120
<v Speaker 5>but who's going to pick the cotton?</v>

5093
02:33:15.420 --> 02:33:16.253
<v Speaker 5>And the answer is,</v>

5094
02:33:16.350 --> 02:33:17.580
<v Speaker 5>it may understand.</v>

5095
02:33:17.860 --> 02:33:21.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that you should have an oppressive government.</v>

5096
02:33:21.930 --> 02:33:26.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying can't we have people that we really love and respect real leaders?</v>

5097
02:33:26.430 --> 02:33:29.040
<v Speaker 5>Because if you look at a guy like bill clinton now,</v>

5098
02:33:29.041 --> 02:33:30.870
<v Speaker 5>now that he stopped chasing tail and everything,</v>

5099
02:33:31.050 --> 02:33:31.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5100
02:33:31.670 --> 02:33:32.420
<v Speaker 5>you think he stopped,</v>

5101
02:33:32.420 --> 02:33:33.253
<v Speaker 5>he think he stops.</v>

5102
02:33:35.290 --> 02:33:35.641
<v Speaker 5>He'll think.</v>

5103
02:33:35.641 --> 02:33:36.830
<v Speaker 5>So imagine those,</v>

5104
02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:39.360
<v Speaker 5>those girls and their hard drives,</v>

5105
02:33:40.110 --> 02:33:41.010
<v Speaker 5>clinton picks.</v>

5106
02:33:41.460 --> 02:33:42.530
<v Speaker 5>If they wouldn't stop there,</v>

5107
02:33:42.531 --> 02:33:43.351
<v Speaker 5>be clinton dick pics,</v>

5108
02:33:43.351 --> 02:33:43.591
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

5109
02:33:43.591 --> 02:33:45.360
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think there'll be worth so much money?</v>

5110
02:33:45.390 --> 02:33:46.680
<v Speaker 5>How can the girls keep your mouth shut?</v>

5111
02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:48.840
<v Speaker 5>do you know how many people clinton is killed?</v>

5112
02:33:49.430 --> 02:33:50.850
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how many people clinton's killed.</v>

5113
02:33:50.851 --> 02:33:51.301
<v Speaker 5>You think he's filled?</v>

5114
02:33:51.301 --> 02:33:52.440
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people know,</v>

5115
02:33:52.441 --> 02:33:53.760
<v Speaker 5>but I think after you suck his dick,</v>

5116
02:33:53.761 --> 02:33:54.750
<v Speaker 5>you get a little briefing.</v>

5117
02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:56.460
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that.</v>

5118
02:33:56.490 --> 02:33:58.530
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever read the strange death of vince foster?</v>

5119
02:33:58.590 --> 02:33:58.811
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5120
02:33:58.811 --> 02:33:59.700
<v Speaker 5>the story that guy,</v>

5121
02:33:59.870 --> 02:34:01.230
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the guys involved.</v>

5122
02:34:01.231 --> 02:34:04.050
<v Speaker 5>And somehoW or another he had some sort of connection to that giant real estate</v>

5123
02:34:04.051 --> 02:34:07.490
<v Speaker 5>deal that the clintons were involved in were fucking this.</v>

5124
02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:07.651
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5125
02:34:07.651 --> 02:34:09.230
<v Speaker 5>that's what I'm talking about there.</v>

5126
02:34:09.430 --> 02:34:13.770
<v Speaker 5>There was a guy that went around that had this list of 70 people that</v>

5127
02:34:13.771 --> 02:34:15.210
<v Speaker 5>mysteriously died around.</v>

5128
02:34:15.210 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 5>The clinton family might just be how things are done.</v>

5129
02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:21.100
<v Speaker 5>It might just be how at a certain point in government,</v>

5130
02:34:21.101 --> 02:34:23.050
<v Speaker 5>everybody just knows that's how shit's done.</v>

5131
02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:24.370
<v Speaker 5>And it's always been that way.</v>

5132
02:34:24.930 --> 02:34:25.480
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

5133
02:34:25.480 --> 02:34:26.950
<v Speaker 5>here's the zapruder film.</v>

5134
02:34:27.130 --> 02:34:27.963
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's just,</v>

5135
02:34:28.450 --> 02:34:29.020
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

5136
02:34:29.020 --> 02:34:30.100
<v Speaker 5>he's been that way.</v>

5137
02:34:30.130 --> 02:34:30.963
<v Speaker 5>It seems like.</v>

5138
02:34:31.660 --> 02:34:31.871
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5139
02:34:31.871 --> 02:34:34.000
<v Speaker 5>you don't bomb out all the things that obama said.</v>

5140
02:34:34.060 --> 02:34:34.331
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5141
02:34:34.331 --> 02:34:36.730
<v Speaker 5>you think about the stores of obama being in Hawaii,</v>

5142
02:34:36.731 --> 02:34:38.050
<v Speaker 5>smoking pot with his friends.</v>

5143
02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:38.771
<v Speaker 5>His friends had.</v>

5144
02:34:38.771 --> 02:34:40.320
<v Speaker 5>obama would go interception step.</v>

5145
02:34:40.330 --> 02:34:41.200
<v Speaker 5>They don't take the joint.</v>

5146
02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:44.240
<v Speaker 5>It would asshole fat stoner.</v>

5147
02:34:44.530 --> 02:34:44.711
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5148
02:34:44.711 --> 02:34:47.660
<v Speaker 5>What was the news that obama was a star?</v>

5149
02:34:47.980 --> 02:34:48.701
<v Speaker 5>He was an asshole.</v>

5150
02:34:48.701 --> 02:34:49.534
<v Speaker 5>Stoner.</v>

5151
02:34:49.750 --> 02:34:50.291
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5152
02:34:50.291 --> 02:34:50.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5153
02:34:50.560 --> 02:34:52.270
<v Speaker 5>unless everybody's already high.</v>

5154
02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:53.590
<v Speaker 5>And it's just funny.</v>

5155
02:34:53.690 --> 02:34:54.523
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of funny.</v>

5156
02:34:55.650 --> 02:34:56.580
<v Speaker 5>It could be an inside job.</v>

5157
02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:59.310
<v Speaker 5>If everybody's already baked and you just pointlessly court.</v>

5158
02:34:59.311 --> 02:35:01.150
<v Speaker 5>He's the guy always buying the weed,</v>

5159
02:35:01.151 --> 02:35:01.511
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5160
02:35:01.511 --> 02:35:02.100
<v Speaker 5>and it's like,</v>

02:35:02.100 --> 02:35:02.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm a heavyweight,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm going to buy the weed.</v>

5163
02:35:03.940 --> 02:35:04.420
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

5164
02:35:04.420 --> 02:35:09.420
<v Speaker 5>or it can be a selfish dick asshole power broker who's murdering people as a</v>

5165
02:35:09.590 --> 02:35:10.960
<v Speaker 5>president of the United States.</v>

5166
02:35:12.310 --> 02:35:16.360
<v Speaker 5>It was a strange time when obama won the nobel peace prize and then they sent</v>

5167
02:35:16.361 --> 02:35:18.280
<v Speaker 5>30,000 more people to Afghanistan,</v>

02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:19.540
<v Speaker 5>like a boiler</v>

02:35:22.500 --> 02:35:23.333
<v Speaker 5>change.</v>

5170
02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:24.400
<v Speaker 5>It was so strange.</v>

5171
02:35:24.401 --> 02:35:24.850
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

5172
02:35:24.850 --> 02:35:25.480
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

5177
02:35:32.441 --> 02:35:34.300

5178
02:35:34.780 --> 02:35:38.020
<v Speaker 5>giant episode of the watchman if like they continued to make the series.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you kid to,</v>

5210
02:36:12.041 --> 02:36:13.930
<v Speaker 5>to all gardenIng in one episode.</v>

5211
02:36:13.931 --> 02:36:15.250
<v Speaker 5>You're overdoing yourself.</v>

5212
02:36:15.640 --> 02:36:17.830
<v Speaker 5>You're becoming a parody of your own creation.</v>

5213
02:36:18.010 --> 02:36:18.843
<v Speaker 5>Stop it.</v>

5214
02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:21.640
<v Speaker 5>Stop before you ruin this fucking beautiful show.</v>

5215
02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:22.830
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5216
02:36:22.830 --> 02:36:24.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm totally not disagreeing with you by the way.</v>

5217
02:36:24.611 --> 02:36:25.630
<v Speaker 5>When we talked about anything,</v>

5218
02:36:25.660 --> 02:36:26.500
<v Speaker 5>It's just I just,</v>

5219
02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:26.670
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5220
02:36:26.670 --> 02:36:29.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm a devil's advocate sort of a guy and I think the effort explore whenever</v>

5221
02:36:29.951 --> 02:36:31.180
<v Speaker 5>someone gives me absolute,</v>

5222
02:36:31.210 --> 02:36:32.410
<v Speaker 5>that's when I automatically go,</v>

5223
02:36:32.470 --> 02:36:32.700
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

5224
02:36:32.700 --> 02:36:33.370
<v Speaker 5>what about this?</v>

5225
02:36:33.370 --> 02:36:34.203
<v Speaker 5>And it's not that I'm,</v>

5226
02:36:34.270 --> 02:36:34.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5227
02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:36.400
<v Speaker 5>and people will argue with me on twitter and I'm like,</v>

5228
02:36:36.401 --> 02:36:37.230
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you too.</v>

5229
02:36:37.230 --> 02:36:37.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

5230
02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:38.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

5231
02:36:38.330 --> 02:36:43.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm not committed to any version of the future that I think is going to be</v>

5232
02:36:43.810 --> 02:36:44.500
<v Speaker 5>optimum,</v>

5233
02:36:44.500 --> 02:36:48.340
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not averse to the idea that someone could be in a position where they</v>

5234
02:36:48.341 --> 02:36:52.570
<v Speaker 5>could benevolently guide people instead of the idea of run us like a government,</v>

5235
02:36:52.870 --> 02:36:53.321
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5236
02:36:53.321 --> 02:36:57.370
<v Speaker 5>and be able to be involved in some sort of fucking crazy gun running scheme and</v>

5237
02:36:57.580 --> 02:37:00.850
<v Speaker 5>evoke executive privilege where you don't have to talk about the crazy gun</v>

5238
02:37:00.851 --> 02:37:05.290
<v Speaker 5>running scheme that they sold guns to mexican drug dealers and one of them</v>

5239
02:37:05.291 --> 02:37:06.490
<v Speaker 5>killed the us federal agent.</v>

5240
02:37:06.610 --> 02:37:07.690
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to talk about that.</v>

5241
02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:10.570
<v Speaker 5>Not in my vision of what's possible.</v>

5242
02:37:10.571 --> 02:37:12.910
<v Speaker 5>I think you have to be accountable for all your information.</v>

5243
02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:16.580
<v Speaker 5>You have to be accountable for all your duties and it should be a place of</v>

5244
02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:17.301
<v Speaker 5>benevolence.</v>

5245
02:37:17.301 --> 02:37:18.350
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's possible,</v>

5246
02:37:18.351 --> 02:37:22.010
<v Speaker 5>man with technology too is happening with your podcast.</v>

5247
02:37:22.010 --> 02:37:23.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it's happening with this pot.</v>

5248
02:37:23.410 --> 02:37:23.570
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5249
02:37:23.570 --> 02:37:23.681
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

5250
02:37:23.681 --> 02:37:23.811
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

5251
02:37:23.811 --> 02:37:23.931
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

5252
02:37:23.931 --> 02:37:27.080
<v Speaker 5>I mean in a real simple mechanical sense,</v>

5253
02:37:27.081 --> 02:37:28.760
<v Speaker 5>the way that technology is empowering,</v>

5254
02:37:28.970 --> 02:37:29.241
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5255
02:37:29.241 --> 02:37:30.140
<v Speaker 5>google glasses,</v>

5256
02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:33.470
<v Speaker 5>pretty soon we're going to have facial recognition embedded in contact lenses.</v>

5257
02:37:33.471 --> 02:37:33.950
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

5258
02:37:33.950 --> 02:37:36.710
<v Speaker 5>And to the extent that you want to make your information public,</v>

5259
02:37:36.940 --> 02:37:40.350
<v Speaker 5>you'll people will be able to scan your face and see your reputation and it'll</v>

5260
02:37:40.370 --> 02:37:40.880
<v Speaker 5>be your rep.</v>

5261
02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:42.710
<v Speaker 5>There'll be some way of accounting for your reputation,</v>

5262
02:37:42.711 --> 02:37:44.510
<v Speaker 5>be allegedly that pops up.</v>

5263
02:37:44.511 --> 02:37:47.440
<v Speaker 5>If people want to see that your yelp score stars,</v>

5264
02:37:47.950 --> 02:37:51.050
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be able to like we're all in that laser thing that they have at</v>

5265
02:37:51.051 --> 02:37:54.800
<v Speaker 5>the tsa agents checkpoints now where they shoot the laser and read all your</v>

5266
02:37:54.801 --> 02:37:55.430
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

5267
02:37:55.430 --> 02:37:57.590
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have that embedded in your glasses.</v>

5268
02:37:57.591 --> 02:38:00.620
<v Speaker 5>It's all going to be a part of this system of accountability.</v>

5269
02:38:00.621 --> 02:38:04.700
<v Speaker 5>And it's weird because you know everybody should be uncomfortable about how</v>

5270
02:38:04.940 --> 02:38:06.050
<v Speaker 5>privacy is going away,</v>

5271
02:38:06.051 --> 02:38:06.920
<v Speaker 5>but if anything,</v>

5272
02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:11.240
<v Speaker 5>you get the government out of it and you decide what your level of invasiveness</v>

5273
02:38:11.241 --> 02:38:11.540
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

5274
02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:13.700
<v Speaker 5>And that's what's so cool about this technology,</v>

5275
02:38:13.701 --> 02:38:17.360
<v Speaker 5>empowering people to do things that we think we need government for that we</v>

5276
02:38:17.361 --> 02:38:18.170
<v Speaker 5>really don't.</v>

5277
02:38:18.170 --> 02:38:21.050
<v Speaker 5>And it's now with the technology as superfluous as it is,</v>

5278
02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:21.541
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

5279
02:38:21.541 --> 02:38:21.661
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

5280
02:38:21.661 --> 02:38:22.640
<v Speaker 5>it's easy to see it.</v>

5281
02:38:22.641 --> 02:38:23.660
<v Speaker 5>You can see it coming.</v>

5282
02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:24.351
<v Speaker 5>I see What you're saying.</v>

5283
02:38:24.351 --> 02:38:27.680
<v Speaker 5>what you're saying is that people are going to have to act together and instead</v>

5284
02:38:27.681 --> 02:38:30.410
<v Speaker 5>of government they're going to have to form some sort of a sense of community.</v>

5285
02:38:30.740 --> 02:38:32.990
<v Speaker 5>It's just really hard to do that when the numbers are so big.</v>

5286
02:38:33.230 --> 02:38:37.250
<v Speaker 5>We're just not designed to deal and be able to manage hundreds of millions of</v>

5287
02:38:37.250 --> 02:38:39.920
<v Speaker 5>people when one person is in charge of that,</v>

5288
02:38:39.921 --> 02:38:41.150
<v Speaker 5>it's almost ridicuLous.</v>

5289
02:38:41.151 --> 02:38:41.271
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5290
02:38:41.271 --> 02:38:42.410
<v Speaker 5>who's in charge of the internet?</v>

5291
02:38:42.411 --> 02:38:43.610
<v Speaker 5>You know that's the high though.</v>

5292
02:38:43.611 --> 02:38:44.510
<v Speaker 5>That's where it's happening.</v>

5293
02:38:44.530 --> 02:38:45.361
<v Speaker 5>That's what's beautiful,</v>

5294
02:38:45.361 --> 02:38:48.620
<v Speaker 5>but the internet paradigm is shifting right now at least can't really make</v>

5295
02:38:48.621 --> 02:38:49.700
<v Speaker 5>physical things.</v>

5296
02:38:49.850 --> 02:38:50.350
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5297
02:38:50.350 --> 02:38:53.870
<v Speaker 5>a manifest themselves as easily as a group of people can.</v>

5298
02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:54.081
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5299
02:38:54.081 --> 02:38:55.790
<v Speaker 5>our civil disobedience beach party,</v>

5300
02:38:55.791 --> 02:38:58.550
<v Speaker 5>that was a group of people breaking laws and standing up to the man the other</v>

5301
02:38:58.551 --> 02:39:02.030
<v Speaker 5>day happened on 24 hour notice because I got a facebook and a twitter account.</v>

5302
02:39:02.450 --> 02:39:03.200
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

5303
02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:05.100
<v Speaker 5>Well you dug holes and</v>

5304
02:39:06.740 --> 02:39:07.573
<v Speaker 5>start.</v>

5305
02:39:07.650 --> 02:39:08.510
<v Speaker 5>it's a start.</v>

5306
02:39:08.511 --> 02:39:12.680
<v Speaker 5>We're working on the tax revolt for when obamacare is fully implemented.</v>

5307
02:39:12.681 --> 02:39:12.941
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5308
02:39:12.941 --> 02:39:13.774
<v Speaker 5>but like this is,</v>

5309
02:39:13.820 --> 02:39:17.420
<v Speaker 5>this is how you start is by celebrating civil disobedience.</v>

5310
02:39:17.430 --> 02:39:20.540
<v Speaker 5>And second is the conversations that you've,</v>

5311
02:39:20.541 --> 02:39:20.870
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5312
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:23.960
<v Speaker 5>you started on this podcast and the topics that you,</v>

5313
02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:25.760
<v Speaker 5>you're so passionate about.</v>

5314
02:39:25.820 --> 02:39:29.720
<v Speaker 5>This is really how it starts because now there's some dude right now that is on</v>

5315
02:39:29.721 --> 02:39:30.230
<v Speaker 5>the train,</v>

5316
02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:34.220
<v Speaker 5>on his way to work and he listens to this podcast every day and these ideas are</v>

5317
02:39:34.221 --> 02:39:39.170
<v Speaker 5>imprinting in his head and they're helping him or influencing him in his</v>

5318
02:39:39.171 --> 02:39:40.940
<v Speaker 5>decision and what he's going to do witH his future.</v>

5319
02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:44.450
<v Speaker 5>And that's where I think everything is starting.</v>

5320
02:39:44.451 --> 02:39:45.740
<v Speaker 5>I think everything right now,</v>

5321
02:39:45.770 --> 02:39:50.510
<v Speaker 5>what we're seeing as far as the changing of the world is nothing compared to the</v>

5322
02:39:50.511 --> 02:39:55.370
<v Speaker 5>people that are growing up with the internet from baby to grown up.</v>

5323
02:39:55.371 --> 02:39:56.810
<v Speaker 5>Because that's a totally different.</v>

5324
02:39:57.880 --> 02:39:58.700
<v Speaker 5>They're not gonna.</v>

5325
02:39:58.700 --> 02:40:00.740
<v Speaker 5>You're not gonna be able to sell them donald rumsfeld.</v>

5326
02:40:00.741 --> 02:40:01.480
<v Speaker 5>Bullshit.</v>

5327
02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:04.130
<v Speaker 5>You're not gonna be able to sell though dewey decimal system,</v>

5328
02:40:04.290 --> 02:40:05.031
<v Speaker 5>horse shit.</v>

5329
02:40:05.031 --> 02:40:05.390
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

5330
02:40:05.390 --> 02:40:08.000
<v Speaker 5>They're going to google and know on a fucking note,</v>

5331
02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:08.990
<v Speaker 5>it looks like a laptop,</v>

5332
02:40:08.991 --> 02:40:10.160
<v Speaker 5>but it fits in your pocket.</v>

5333
02:40:10.510 --> 02:40:12.020
<v Speaker 5>You can fucking say,</v>

5334

5337
02:40:15.630 --> 02:40:15.900
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

5338
02:40:15.900 --> 02:40:18.750
<v Speaker 5>they know that public schools are government run indoctrination centers.</v>

5339
02:40:18.751 --> 02:40:18.991
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5340
02:40:18.991 --> 02:40:19.800

<v Speaker 5>They have no money and everybody suck.</v>

5344
02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:26.790
<v Speaker 5>What is the purpose they serve to government,</v>

5345
02:40:26.791 --> 02:40:27.031
<v Speaker 5>man?</v>

5346
02:40:27.031 --> 02:40:27.151
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5347
02:40:27.151 --> 02:40:27.811
<v Speaker 5>it's more than that.</v>

5348
02:40:27.811 --> 02:40:29.820
<v Speaker 5>There's a reason government has taken over education.</v>

5349
02:40:29.821 --> 02:40:30.000
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

5350
02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:31.350
<v Speaker 5>This is the dumbing down.</v>

5351
02:40:31.590 --> 02:40:34.200
<v Speaker 5>You look at the federal department of education instituted like what?</v>

5352
02:40:34.201 --> 02:40:34.441
<v Speaker 5>Forty,</v>

5353
02:40:34.441 --> 02:40:39.300
<v Speaker 5>50 years ago when we were at or near the top of every international educational</v>

5354
02:40:39.301 --> 02:40:40.230
<v Speaker 5>ranking system.</v>

5355
02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:41.540
<v Speaker 5>Now we're down like 30,</v>

5356
02:40:41.570 --> 02:40:42.150
<v Speaker 5>40.</v>

5357
02:40:42.150 --> 02:40:43.710
<v Speaker 5>It's not by accident.</v>

5358
02:40:43.711 --> 02:40:44.640
<v Speaker 5>It's by design.</v>

5359
02:40:44.820 --> 02:40:47.340
<v Speaker 5>What I've seen to be dumbed down and not question government.</v>

5360
02:40:47.341 --> 02:40:50.190
<v Speaker 5>They want to control the curriculum so you don't learn about topics like what</v>

5361
02:40:50.191 --> 02:40:51.001
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about now.</v>

5362
02:40:51.001 --> 02:40:52.710
<v Speaker 5>This is why they don't teach real history.</v>

5363
02:40:52.711 --> 02:40:52.990
<v Speaker 5>They've been.</v>

5364
02:40:52.990 --> 02:40:54.000
<v Speaker 5>Who is thinking,</v>

5365
02:40:54.030 --> 02:40:54.421
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

5366
02:40:54.421 --> 02:40:55.470
<v Speaker 5>this is the real problem with that.</v>

5367
02:40:55.471 --> 02:40:56.790
<v Speaker 5>I think it's more incompetent.</v>

5368
02:40:58.010 --> 02:40:58.200
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5369
02:40:58.200 --> 02:40:58.620
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>

5370
02:40:58.620 --> 02:41:00.990
<v Speaker 5>No incontinent product of the paradigm.</v>

5371
02:41:02.130 --> 02:41:05.190
<v Speaker 5>People don't benefit and profit from making the schools better,</v>

5372
02:41:05.191 --> 02:41:06.840
<v Speaker 5>so it's easy to keep them suppressed.</v>

5373
02:41:06.990 --> 02:41:10.500
<v Speaker 5>It's not that there's some sort of a strategy to try to keep people stupid.</v>

5374
02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:13.230
<v Speaker 5>It's that there's no money to be made for making people smart.</v>

5375
02:41:13.350 --> 02:41:15.350
<v Speaker 5>So why should they try so they don't trust.</v>

5376
02:41:15.351 --> 02:41:16.320
<v Speaker 5>So tHe underfunded schools,</v>

5377
02:41:16.330 --> 02:41:17.340
<v Speaker 5>so when things get cut,</v>

5378
02:41:17.490 --> 02:41:19.770
<v Speaker 5>cut the fucking teachers pay for fuck math suck.</v>

5379
02:41:19.771 --> 02:41:21.080
<v Speaker 5>My dick cut her pay.</v>

5380
02:41:21.150 --> 02:41:22.500
<v Speaker 5>So that's what we need to balance the budget,</v>

5381
02:41:22.501 --> 02:41:23.070
<v Speaker 5>which we do.</v>

5382
02:41:23.070 --> 02:41:26.130
<v Speaker 5>Cut the school no more wrestling and that's where it's coming from.</v>

5383
02:41:26.131 --> 02:41:29.670
<v Speaker 5>It's not coming from some fucking grand poobah plot with as much assholes</v>

5384
02:41:29.790 --> 02:41:31.950
<v Speaker 5>standing in the middle of a field burning in effigy,</v>

5385
02:41:31.951 --> 02:41:33.570
<v Speaker 5>deciding how people stupid,</v>

5386
02:41:33.970 --> 02:41:34.600
<v Speaker 5>incompetent.</v>

5387
02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:37.350
<v Speaker 5>It's incompetent conspiracy.</v>

5388
02:41:37.351 --> 02:41:38.600
<v Speaker 5>What can be described by incumbents?</v>

5389
02:41:38.601 --> 02:41:38.851
<v Speaker 5>Comments?</v>

5390
02:41:38.851 --> 02:41:39.720
<v Speaker 5>I learned that from work,</v>

5391
02:41:39.721 --> 02:41:40.491
<v Speaker 5>especially with government,</v>

5392
02:41:40.491 --> 02:41:41.490
<v Speaker 5>government workers,</v>

5393
02:41:41.491 --> 02:41:42.000
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5394
02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:43.320
<v Speaker 5>Government fucking workers.</v>

5395
02:41:43.321 --> 02:41:43.920
<v Speaker 5>That's the.</v>

5396
02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:46.290
<v Speaker 5>That is the tap out job of all time.</v>

5397
02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:46.651
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

5398
02:41:46.651 --> 02:41:46.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm not.</v>

5399
02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:47.880
<v Speaker 5>I got no ambition,</v>

5400
02:41:47.881 --> 02:41:48.151
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

5401
02:41:48.151 --> 02:41:49.920
<v Speaker 5>You know what I gotta do you know what you want me to do?</v>

5402
02:41:50.310 --> 02:41:52.080
<v Speaker 5>This is the reason and it's not by accident.</v>

5403
02:41:52.081 --> 02:41:57.000
<v Speaker 5>The first thing they cut from the curriculum is your ability to see what is</v>

5404
02:41:57.001 --> 02:41:57.834
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>

5405
02:41:58.320 --> 02:41:59.153
<v Speaker 5>What is that?</v>

5406
02:41:59.220 --> 02:42:00.053
<v Speaker 5>What's going to help you?</v>

5407
02:42:00.060 --> 02:42:01.690
<v Speaker 5>They don't shit teachers to folks.</v>

5408
02:42:01.710 --> 02:42:02.380
<v Speaker 5>They don't teach.</v>

5409
02:42:02.380 --> 02:42:02.940
<v Speaker 5>They don't teach.</v>

5410
02:42:02.940 --> 02:42:03.773
<v Speaker 5>Well the august,</v>

5411
02:42:04.320 --> 02:42:05.520
<v Speaker 5>they don't teach cIvics anymore.</v>

5412
02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:07.680
<v Speaker 5>He put you in a room with a teenage kid.</v>

5413
02:42:07.740 --> 02:42:08.670
<v Speaker 5>That's a nice guy.</v>

5414
02:42:08.850 --> 02:42:09.540
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

5415
02:42:09.540 --> 02:42:12.060
<v Speaker 5>when a water put you in a room and a teenage kid,</v>

5416
02:42:12.061 --> 02:42:13.630
<v Speaker 5>that's a nice guy and he lets test,</v>

5417
02:42:13.830 --> 02:42:15.600
<v Speaker 5>tells you to go to all his favorite websites.</v>

5418
02:42:15.780 --> 02:42:18.140
<v Speaker 5>Can you guys just go to websites all day and you learn shit?</v>

5419
02:42:18.141 --> 02:42:19.020
<v Speaker 5>Now look at the cnn.</v>

5420
02:42:19.021 --> 02:42:19.411
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>

5421
02:42:19.411 --> 02:42:20.430
<v Speaker 5>This is a story right here.</v>

5422
02:42:20.500 --> 02:42:22.140
<v Speaker 5>This is how the egyptian god got in government.</v>

5423
02:42:22.270 --> 02:42:24.330
<v Speaker 5>I hear this now you go like this and you find out.</v>

5424
02:42:24.331 --> 02:42:27.390
<v Speaker 5>Well they were actually worse off with the new government in Egypt because</v>

5425
02:42:27.391 --> 02:42:28.400
<v Speaker 5>they're even more crazy.</v>

5426
02:42:28.430 --> 02:42:29.670
<v Speaker 5>The muslim brotherhood.</v>

5427
02:42:29.910 --> 02:42:30.541
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit.</v>

5428
02:42:30.541 --> 02:42:34.650
<v Speaker 5>I mean you can get more education and have a couple of hours with a curious</v>

5429
02:42:34.651 --> 02:42:37.350
<v Speaker 5>person and a computer then you can out of most school day.</v>

5430
02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:37.510
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5431
02:42:37.510 --> 02:42:40.590
<v Speaker 5>this is one of the things that that's happening in America right now.</v>

5432
02:42:40.591 --> 02:42:44.910
<v Speaker 5>This will we call the libertarian mind melt and It's kind of a phenomenon we see</v>

5433
02:42:44.911 --> 02:42:45.870
<v Speaker 5>people going through.</v>

5434
02:42:46.470 --> 02:42:47.251
<v Speaker 5>We used to joke like,</v>

5435
02:42:47.251 --> 02:42:49.620
<v Speaker 5>what's the dIfference between a minnaar kissed and an anarchist?</v>

5436
02:42:49.900 --> 02:42:50.160
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5437
02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:54.510
<v Speaker 5>someone who kissed someone who believes in government limited to the</v>

5438
02:42:54.511 --> 02:42:56.520
<v Speaker 5>constitution or to specific principles,</v>

5439
02:42:56.730 --> 02:42:56.941
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5440
02:42:56.941 --> 02:43:00.270
<v Speaker 5>the government should only be used for this or that as opposed to really we</v>

5441
02:43:00.271 --> 02:43:02.400
<v Speaker 5>should evolve past government and that expression.</v>

5442
02:43:02.401 --> 02:43:03.190
<v Speaker 5>A menard kissed.</v>

5443
02:43:03.190 --> 02:43:03.940
<v Speaker 5>How are you spelling it?</v>

5444
02:43:03.940 --> 02:43:04.400
<v Speaker 5>Am I on?</v>

5445
02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:05.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm on invest.</v>

5446
02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:05.840
<v Speaker 5>Minimal.</v>

5447
02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:06.673
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly.</v>

5448
02:43:07.170 --> 02:43:09.720
<v Speaker 5>And ron paul is often confused as them in our case,</v>

5449
02:43:09.721 --> 02:43:09.901
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5450
02:43:09.901 --> 02:43:10.150
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

5451
02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.410
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

5452
02:43:10.410 --> 02:43:11.980
<v Speaker 5>he presents a monarch is</v>

5453
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:15.640
<v Speaker 4>platform as an immediate practical transition of going back to the constitution</v>

5454
02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:17.500
<v Speaker 4>or at least getting government restrained to what it's,</v>

5455
02:43:17.610 --> 02:43:17.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5456
02:43:17.870 --> 02:43:19.960
<v Speaker 4>legally authorized to do supposedly.</v>

5457
02:43:20.430 --> 02:43:21.730
<v Speaker 4>And his,</v>

5458
02:43:21.780 --> 02:43:23.680
<v Speaker 4>his end goal though is a volunteer society.</v>

5459
02:43:23.681 --> 02:43:25.570
<v Speaker 4>And when I interviewed him for my tv show,</v>

5460
02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:28.190
<v Speaker 4>we talked about this and he says that he is a volunteer.</v>

5461
02:43:28.191 --> 02:43:30.100
<v Speaker 4>It's all human interaction should be free of force,</v>

5462
02:43:30.101 --> 02:43:30.861
<v Speaker 4>fraud and coercion.</v>

5463
02:43:30.861 --> 02:43:31.510
<v Speaker 4>And when,</v>

5464
02:43:31.510 --> 02:43:31.760
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

5465
02:43:31.760 --> 02:43:32.890
<v Speaker 4>when you really get that,</v>

5466
02:43:33.070 --> 02:43:33.571
<v Speaker 4>you know you're,</v>

5467
02:43:33.571 --> 02:43:35.290
<v Speaker 4>you're okay saying I don't know,</v>

5468
02:43:35.540 --> 02:43:38.510
<v Speaker 4>when you look to the future and you're okay saying law,</v>

5469
02:43:38.630 --> 02:43:39.940
<v Speaker 4>when we don't have slavery,</v>

5470
02:43:39.941 --> 02:43:41.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who's going to pick the con.</v>

5471
02:43:41.531 --> 02:43:46.531
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if we're going to have big machines that do that are going to pick,</v>

5472
02:43:47.560 --> 02:43:51.910
<v Speaker 4>pick the cotton for us and then spit out t shirts like we don't know how that's</v>

5473
02:43:51.911 --> 02:43:53.350
<v Speaker 4>gonna happen and who's going to build the roads.</v>

5474
02:43:53.350 --> 02:43:56.410
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what's the exact system that the market is going to be able to do.</v>

5475
02:43:56.411 --> 02:43:57.160
<v Speaker 4>Who's going to do it?</v>

5476
02:43:57.160 --> 02:43:58.000
<v Speaker 4>People are going to do it.</v>

5477
02:43:58.001 --> 02:43:58.930
<v Speaker 4>People are gonna do it peacefully.</v>

5478
02:43:58.931 --> 02:44:03.590
<v Speaker 4>And when you understand that government is not going to be potholes everywhere</v>

5479
02:44:03.591 --> 02:44:06.280
<v Speaker 4>and nothing is ever going to get to that part,</v>

5480
02:44:06.281 --> 02:44:07.150
<v Speaker 4>lazy bitches,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

5484
02:44:12.820 --> 02:44:13.930
<v Speaker 4>People are ready for that yet.</v>

5485
02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:14.980
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're saying.</v>

02:44:15.310 --> 02:44:16.420
<v Speaker 4>we both want improvement.</v>

5487
02:44:16.421 --> 02:44:17.254
<v Speaker 4>I see whaT you're saying.</v>

5488
02:44:17.260 --> 02:44:18.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I'm married your system though,</v>

5489
02:44:18.761 --> 02:44:19.480
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

5490
02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:21.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I'm married to this crazy people.</v>

5491
02:44:21.430 --> 02:44:22.030
<v Speaker 4>People use,</v>

5492
02:44:22.030 --> 02:44:23.410
<v Speaker 4>people will go system,</v>

5493
02:44:23.530 --> 02:44:24.030
<v Speaker 4>people are,</v>

5494
02:44:24.030 --> 02:44:24.250
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

5495
02:44:24.250 --> 02:44:26.470
<v Speaker 4>are going through this and and in the course of.</v>

5496
02:44:26.471 --> 02:44:26.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean we've,</v>

5497
02:44:26.940 --> 02:44:28.260
<v Speaker 4>we've been talking for a few hours.</v>

5498
02:44:28.300 --> 02:44:29.470
<v Speaker 4>Then of course if a conversation,</v>

5499
02:44:29.710 --> 02:44:32.560
<v Speaker 4>it's very hard for someone to really shed their,</v>

5500
02:44:32.561 --> 02:44:35.950
<v Speaker 4>their attachment to violence because that's what it is.</v>

5501
02:44:35.950 --> 02:44:39.310
<v Speaker 4>YOu have an comparing violence though the government doesn't necessarily have to</v>

5502
02:44:39.311 --> 02:44:41.590
<v Speaker 4>be violent if it evolves in the council 10 minutes,</v>

5503
02:44:41.591 --> 02:44:45.190
<v Speaker 4>you just got the 10 minute warning at three hours are fucking thing becomes a</v>

5504
02:44:45.191 --> 02:44:45.970
<v Speaker 4>pumpkin.</v>

5505
02:44:45.970 --> 02:44:46.380
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5506
02:44:46.380 --> 02:44:46.930
<v Speaker 4>we're done.</v>

5507
02:44:46.930 --> 02:44:48.610
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the definition will of government.</v>

5508
02:44:48.611 --> 02:44:49.810
<v Speaker 4>It's all backed up by force,</v>

5509
02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:53.440
<v Speaker 4>but I know that that is an option,</v>

5510
02:44:53.470 --> 02:44:57.490
<v Speaker 4>but I don't necessarily believe that the idea is that everything you're doing,</v>

5511
02:44:57.491 --> 02:44:59.370
<v Speaker 4>you're doing the threat of violence,</v>

5512
02:44:59.371 --> 02:45:01.810
<v Speaker 4>so we're just using different terms of threat of violence is only there for</v>

5513
02:45:01.811 --> 02:45:04.450
<v Speaker 4>people that don't want to subscribe to the standards of the community.</v>

5514
02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:05.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing whAt I'm saying.</v>

5515
02:45:05.621 --> 02:45:09.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm defining government as the use of violence in that sense.</v>

5516
02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:10.031
<v Speaker 4>So you're just,</v>

5517
02:45:10.031 --> 02:45:10.391
<v Speaker 4>you're just,</v>

5518
02:45:10.391 --> 02:45:12.440
<v Speaker 4>you just have a broader sense of what government is.</v>

5519
02:45:12.460 --> 02:45:13.600
<v Speaker 4>Only the use of violence.</v>

5520
02:45:13.601 --> 02:45:14.710
<v Speaker 4>If things go wrong,</v>

5521
02:45:14.890 --> 02:45:18.460
<v Speaker 4>it's not the use of violence or if someone disagrees with the majority,</v>

5522
02:45:18.470 --> 02:45:19.570
<v Speaker 4>that's just shit cops.</v>

5523
02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:22.630
<v Speaker 4>It's just shit that anybody who doesn't want to pay for wars,</v>

5524
02:45:22.850 --> 02:45:25.300
<v Speaker 4>you can protest all you want as long as you keep paying your taxes,</v>

5525
02:45:25.420 --> 02:45:26.320
<v Speaker 4>they'll still be a war.</v>

5526
02:45:27.130 --> 02:45:27.850
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5527
02:45:27.850 --> 02:45:29.770
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're saying that your money's going to go to that anyway.</v>

5528
02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:33.400
<v Speaker 4>But what would be a beautiful thing if you were able to vote whether or not your</v>

5529
02:45:33.401 --> 02:45:34.234
<v Speaker 4>money went to the war,</v>

5530
02:45:34.420 --> 02:45:34.870
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>

5531
02:45:34.870 --> 02:45:38.980
<v Speaker 4>would award be different than if you could like check off of what someone should</v>

5532
02:45:38.981 --> 02:45:42.910
<v Speaker 4>introduce that they should say you get to vote whether or not any of your tax</v>

5533
02:45:42.911 --> 02:45:44.550
<v Speaker 4>dollars ever get you anything.</v>

5534
02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:46.540
<v Speaker 4>Military has to be road worldwide.</v>

5535
02:45:46.541 --> 02:45:46.871
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

5536
02:45:46.871 --> 02:45:47.441
<v Speaker 4>And you'd be like,</v>

5537
02:45:47.441 --> 02:45:48.460
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>

5538
02:45:48.580 --> 02:45:52.980
<v Speaker 4>If you could actually decide to pay less taxes or more tags.</v>

5539
02:45:53.650 --> 02:45:54.550
<v Speaker 4>What I'm advocating,</v>

5540
02:45:55.780 --> 02:45:58.970
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what I'm advocating in war.</v>

5541
02:45:59.470 --> 02:46:01.000
<v Speaker 4>The wars would be really small,</v>

5542
02:46:01.001 --> 02:46:04.720
<v Speaker 4>just like cold up fights between a couple of extra dollar.</v>

5543
02:46:04.721 --> 02:46:05.950
<v Speaker 4>Just so keep me safe.</v>

5547
02:46:10.340 --> 02:46:11.780
