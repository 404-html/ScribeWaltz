<v Speaker 1>Come back.</v>

7
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.900

<v Speaker 1>off of vacation.</v>

8
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Like we just pulled you out of somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>sale,</v>

9
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.050
<v Speaker 1>but as on a fishing trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect,</v>

10
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:22.884
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.790
<v Speaker 1>The endless vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about Elton John,</v>

12
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.683
<v Speaker 1>right before we start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some Elton John Songs </v>

13
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.370
<v Speaker 1>that are just all time classics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

14
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are your favorite top three?</v>

15
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm man.</v>

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you like Daniel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best.</v>

17
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 1>That's a great song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rocket Man is one of my favorites.</v>

18
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

19
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

20
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>let me go over the lyrics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

21
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>that's one of those songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just.</v>

22
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>The lyrics almost become inconsequential</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the lyrics are,</v>

23
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the sound.</v>

24
00:00:57.931 --> 00:00:58.764
<v Speaker 1>That song makes that song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That song has this feeling like listen </v>

25
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.110
<v Speaker 1>to a song in a different language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

26
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.633
<v Speaker 1>It's just an instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird when you find out what song </v>

27
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.680
<v Speaker 1>is about and it's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

28
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>what does it say what it is now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just the lyrics.</v>

29
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad or an astronaut or a lyric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it is.</v>

30
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I think it's about like snorting </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketamine.</v>

31
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a space.</v>

32
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>I miss my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I missed the earth so much.</v>

33
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>You just guessing Dunkin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

34
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean we all get to interpret music in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our own way,</v>

35
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:30.980
<v Speaker 1>but for sure that's out in.</v>

36
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.973
<v Speaker 1>Johnny's in some hotel room is laid out </v>
<v Speaker 1>some blinds academy and he's about the </v>

37
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>baseline is here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

38
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the Druggie or a,</v>

39
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>given that it was penn during the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies drug era,</v>

40
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.203
<v Speaker 1>people can still see that it services an</v>
<v Speaker 1>extended metaphor comparing fame to </v>

41
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:47.510
<v Speaker 1>space travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

42
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>That makes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes a ton of sense.</v>

43
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.323
<v Speaker 1>But it also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it also was about rocket travel </v>

44
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>because Bernie top and wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

45
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.563
<v Speaker 1>he wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote them on what a great </v>

46
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two of those guys like you and young</v>

<v Speaker 1>very similar.</v>

48
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever hears about young Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last time I was here,</v>

49
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:07.390
<v Speaker 1>I tried to get them on my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

50
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.333
<v Speaker 1>he's alluding me really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just want to be on your crazy podcasts </v>

51
00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:15.620

52
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Jamie was on Saturday night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great one.</v>

53
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for fight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's a good one.</v>

55
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a great workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a real kind of.</v>

56
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a punk.</v>

57
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:32.400
<v Speaker 1>British.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:33.234
<v Speaker 1>Saturday night Daniels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time I really thought about </v>

59
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about Daniel,</v>

60
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:39.510
<v Speaker 1>my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's headed out on the plane.</v>

61
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I can see the red tail lights head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Spain friend dying.</v>

62
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.400
<v Speaker 1>He's blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

63
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>it's about as blind brother interpreting</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of your messaging.</v>

64
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.630
<v Speaker 1>You must have a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like him less.</v>

65
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>I like the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What his songs are about.</v>

66
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.660
<v Speaker 1>You know what's interesting about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation is trying to interpret with</v>

67
00:03:00.661 --> 00:03:01.494
<v Speaker 1>songs are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very actual thing that happened when </v>

68
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>people were trying to interpret the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories from the Bible,</v>

69
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to figure out.</v>

70
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he met this.</v>

71
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he meant that these parables and some of</v>

72
00:03:14.331 --> 00:03:15.920
<v Speaker 1>the stories that are in the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>if you go to the John Marco Allegro </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition,</v>

74
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>was it say his song was written from his</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger brother's perspective.</v>

75
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Got a story about a guy who went back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small town in Texas returning from the</v>

76
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

77
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Daniel.</v>

78
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>And he was blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

79
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Your eyes have died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see more than I.</v>

80
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

81
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you still feel the pain of the scars </v>
<v Speaker 1>that won't heal?</v>

82
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.183
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

83
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 2>Have you guys heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that song?</v>

84
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Summer of 69.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

85
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can bring this to Brian Adams </v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

86
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 2>and that's about like actually 68,</v>
<v Speaker 2>69.</v>

87
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

88
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 2>that's what I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

89
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:53.614
<v Speaker 2>like every single one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look it up because I think the </v>

90
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 2>summer of 69,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one interpretation is that's like a fuck</v>

91
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 2>summer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had like $69 a month.</v>

92
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Summer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

93
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 2>is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

94
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Is it true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

95
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.290
<v Speaker 1>had my first real six string,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Bryan Adams fourth album,</v>

96
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:19.770
<v Speaker 1>reckless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some are 69 in many meetings,</v>

97
00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:23.040
<v Speaker 1>although one of them including life in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1969,</v>

98
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.710
<v Speaker 1>while another includes making love with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

99
00:04:25.711 --> 00:04:28.680
<v Speaker 1>hence using the number 69 as a reference</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>

100
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.560
<v Speaker 1>That's not accurate the way they said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

101
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.150
<v Speaker 1>It's just like the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>

102
00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:33.984
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I meant was it's like you would </v>

103
00:04:37.231 --> 00:04:38.064
<v Speaker 1>never say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't be how you convey your </v>

104
00:04:40.351 --> 00:04:41.184
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're writing that song like </v>

105
00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:45.980
<v Speaker 1>the summer of 69 and this say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>

106
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.823
<v Speaker 1>go back to that please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says while another includes making </v>

107
00:04:49.471 --> 00:04:53.580
<v Speaker 1>love with someone that is just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not an accurate way.</v>

108
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about 69 ing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

109
00:04:56.401 --> 00:04:58.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making love but you get crazy.</v>

110
00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.633
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's more to it than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like the same thing as like </v>

111
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.310
<v Speaker 1>trying to interpret stories from a Bible</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

112
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.143
<v Speaker 1>Like you're boiling them down like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to figure out what was </v>

113
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:10.470
<v Speaker 1>this guy actually say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

114
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like literary interpretation.</v>

115
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.120
<v Speaker 1>It's all poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

116
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.330
<v Speaker 1>My favorite example of a song that sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mislead you.</v>

117
00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:19.164
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really like songs were the covers </v>

118
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.023
<v Speaker 1>better than the original because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person doing the cover gets what the </v>

119
00:05:23.671 --> 00:05:25.980
<v Speaker 1>song's about better than the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists does.</v>

120
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean all along the watchtower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hendrix is way better than Dylan's.</v>

121
00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dillon actually said that,</v>

122
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.790
<v Speaker 1>but my favorite example in recent music </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

123
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Hey Ya.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the thought alone is killing me right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>love each other.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

137

<v Speaker 3>If what they say is nothing lasts </v>

138
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 3>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then what makes love the exception?</v>

139
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.621
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

140
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:16.454
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He gets the sadness of it,</v>

147
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:34.743
<v Speaker 3>play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of that</v>

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:36.790
<v Speaker 2>is seen me.</v>

149
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.700
<v Speaker 4>I can't see the feeling because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought alone is,</v>

150
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

151
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.760
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we don't know.</v>

152
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:02.170
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is fucking great.</v>

153
00:07:03.611 --> 00:07:04.444
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people right now screaming at </v>

154
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:07.844
<v Speaker 4>their phone.</v>

155
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:09.683
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what grade it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so fucking sick of your music taste so </v>

156
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.980
<v Speaker 5>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Music tastes are so bad.</v>

157
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.340
<v Speaker 5>I get to more tweets about how bad my </v>
<v Speaker 5>bad</v>

158
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.800
<v Speaker 3>taste is in music and movies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>television and blame it on me.</v>

159
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.620
<v Speaker 3>Did that cut Chris Ryan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

160
00:07:28.621 --> 00:07:29.454
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at something the other </v>

161
00:07:30.301 --> 00:07:31.134
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some something on some video years of </v>

162
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:33.623
<v Speaker 3>comments or something and it occurred to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me how you have your audience is first </v>

163
00:07:37.651 --> 00:07:38.484
<v Speaker 3>of all so large and also so mix because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got your fingers in all these </v>

164
00:07:41.611 --> 00:07:42.444
<v Speaker 3>different worlds that you must get a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>more hostility than someone like Duncan </v>

165
00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:49.620
<v Speaker 3>or me because our audience is more sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of homogeneous.</v>

166
00:07:49.621 --> 00:07:53.430
<v Speaker 3>I would think I'm the bridge between the</v>
<v Speaker 3>meatheads and the potheads exactly.</v>

167
00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.920
<v Speaker 3>So there's conflict and no matter which </v>
<v Speaker 3>way you go,</v>

168
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.610
<v Speaker 3>there's a little bit,</v>

169
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.443
<v Speaker 6>but the meatheads kind of get that look </v>
<v Speaker 6>if you want to go to the far end of the </v>

170
00:08:03.241 --> 00:08:04.770
<v Speaker 6>extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like the UFC fans,</v>

171
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.220
<v Speaker 6>but the UFC fans know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I'm a,</v>

172
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.410
<v Speaker 6>I'm a representative,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I'm doing my best.</v>

173
00:08:10.411 --> 00:08:13.290
<v Speaker 6>Like they know I'm 100 percent into </v>
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

174
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.540
<v Speaker 6>This is not like I'm not like some actor</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they hired to promote this so.</v>

175
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.930
<v Speaker 6>But then you got all the way to the far </v>
<v Speaker 6>left which is the psychedelic people and</v>

176
00:08:21.931 --> 00:08:25.380
<v Speaker 6>I got a ton of Vegan followers and </v>
<v Speaker 6>people that are really into yoga.</v>

177
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.833
<v Speaker 6>It's like all of them together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like the weirdest fucking house </v>

178
00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:29.230
<v Speaker 6>party</v>

179
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.610
<v Speaker 2>it seems sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The comments,</v>

180
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.430
<v Speaker 2>well no man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>

181
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.463
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This Ram das retreat that I just went </v>

182
00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:36.700
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>

183
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.533
<v Speaker 2>one of the people who run runs their </v>
<v Speaker 2>treat wanted me to tell it to thank you </v>

184
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.711

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

185
00:08:41.711 --> 00:08:46.150

<v Speaker 2>these randazzo retreats,</v>

186
00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:46.984
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it was such a strange thing to </v>

187
00:08:49.031 --> 00:08:49.864
<v Speaker 2>think man that you're magnetizing people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bringing them down a slippery where </v>

188
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 2>they</v>

189
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.980
<v Speaker 7>land in Maui,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hanging out with like Buddhist and Hindu</v>

190
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 7>teachers.</v>

191
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:05.490
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a very odd thing.</v>

192
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.730
<v Speaker 7>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like how many tentacles you have fucking</v>

193
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 7>burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jesus Christ.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Burning man.</v>

199
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.880
<v Speaker 8>I can't interact with that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Many people do that anymore.</v>

200
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.500
<v Speaker 8>Those days are done,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you know what?</v>

201
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.420
<v Speaker 8>What has changed?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like a big.</v>

202
00:09:31.421 --> 00:09:33.760
<v Speaker 8>One of the biggest thing that's ever </v>
<v Speaker 8>changed because of this podcast.</v>

203
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.560
<v Speaker 8>The float industry.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

204
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.900
<v Speaker 8>Floating streets taken off.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I get like residual gratitude from float</v>

205
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:45.010
<v Speaker 8>places like I know you know Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can float for free.</v>

206
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.180
<v Speaker 8>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's amazing.</v>

207
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:47.561
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the thing is,</v>

208
00:09:47.561 --> 00:09:50.680
<v Speaker 8>it just didn't make any sense to me that</v>
<v Speaker 8>before I was talking about it,</v>

209
00:09:50.681 --> 00:09:53.410
<v Speaker 8>no one was talking about that this was </v>
<v Speaker 8>something that was invented by Lillian.</v>

210
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.430
<v Speaker 8>What?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Nineteen 60 something happened where you</v>

211
00:09:57.431 --> 00:09:58.264
<v Speaker 8>were vertical know he had one where you </v>
<v Speaker 8>would wear a helmet and you had a </v>

212
00:10:00.581 --> 00:10:02.950
<v Speaker 8>harness and helmet with float you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

213
00:10:02.951 --> 00:10:05.960
<v Speaker 8>and then he figured out the salt thing </v>
<v Speaker 8>and um,</v>

214
00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:10.060
<v Speaker 8>I mean the fact that this was not a </v>
<v Speaker 8>popular thing was blown me away.</v>

215
00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:10.923
<v Speaker 8>Well it was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but then it died because of the age </v>

216
00:10:12.581 --> 00:10:13.280
<v Speaker 8>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

217
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.950
<v Speaker 8>And you brought it back for this </v>
<v Speaker 8>popular?</v>

218
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:15.491
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

219
00:10:15.491 --> 00:10:18.700
<v Speaker 8>but it was much.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was higher than it dropped a lot.</v>

220
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.210
<v Speaker 8>They killed it because nobody knew,</v>
<v Speaker 8>sort of brought it back in.</v>

221
00:10:22.211 --> 00:10:23.620
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So with John Lilly,</v>

222
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.733
<v Speaker 7>you know what's interesting about him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people leave out about him a lot is he </v>

223
00:10:28.721 --> 00:10:29.554
<v Speaker 7>was talking to aliens and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 7>interesting thing that people just kind </v>

224
00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:36.230
<v Speaker 7>of push all that shit aside.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They know him as the flow guy,</v>

225
00:10:36.231 --> 00:10:38.690
<v Speaker 7>you've in a float tank,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dolphin and the Dolphin Guy,</v>

226
00:10:38.691 --> 00:10:39.524
<v Speaker 7>but also they completely leave out that </v>
<v Speaker 7>he was going into those tanks and </v>

227
00:10:42.771 --> 00:10:43.604
<v Speaker 7>claiming some kind of communication with</v>
<v Speaker 7>something called the ECC or something </v>

228
00:10:47.301 --> 00:10:48.134
<v Speaker 7>eco,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know about that they're earth </v>

229
00:10:49.551 --> 00:10:52.730
<v Speaker 7>coincidence control office or something,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know about that.</v>

230
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.580
<v Speaker 7>Then the center of the cyclone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

231
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.443
<v Speaker 7>center the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he was going way out talking about </v>

232
00:10:58.071 --> 00:11:03.071
<v Speaker 7>some kind of like invisible I guess </v>
<v Speaker 7>network that produces coincidence is.</v>

233
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.633
<v Speaker 7>I don't understand it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but people just completely leave that </v>

234
00:11:09.441 --> 00:11:10.274
<v Speaker 7>out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That the guy created float tanks was </v>

235
00:11:11.691 --> 00:11:14.450
<v Speaker 7>using them to communicate with entities</v>

236
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.320
<v Speaker 8>and he was using a lot of ketamine.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A lot academy.</v>

237
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.620
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Or maybe they.</v>

238
00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.860
<v Speaker 8>They're leaving out that the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 8>invented float tanks lost his shit there</v>

239
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:23.980
<v Speaker 8>toward the end.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

240
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.620
<v Speaker 8>he may be,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I think that.</v>

241
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.010
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what's happening when </v>
<v Speaker 8>you're doing psychedelics,</v>

242
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.873
<v Speaker 8>but there are certain psychedelics where</v>
<v Speaker 8>it absolutely feels like you're </v>

243
00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:36.080
<v Speaker 8>experiencing another life form </v>
<v Speaker 8>communicating with you.</v>

244
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.020
<v Speaker 8>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 8>For sure.</v>

245
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:37.854
<v Speaker 8>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if that's the case with ketamine as </v>

246
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:42.330
<v Speaker 8>well.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Ketamine seems to be like me personally,</v>

247
00:11:42.331 --> 00:11:43.164
<v Speaker 8>my personal bias,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I sort of dismiss it because I think of </v>

248
00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:48.880
<v Speaker 8>it as some sort of chemical compound </v>
<v Speaker 8>things,</v>

249
00:11:48.881 --> 00:11:51.180
<v Speaker 8>some sort of a synthetic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That man's career,</v>

250
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:52.410
<v Speaker 8>Ketamine,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what?</v>

251
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.090
<v Speaker 8>Something is more</v>

252
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.933
<v Speaker 1>reliable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's just my own </v>

253
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:56.763
<v Speaker 1>ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think really we're just talking about </v>

254
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 1>chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

255
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:00.874
<v Speaker 1>And how chemicals that exist in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when someone says it's an </v>

256
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:04.354
<v Speaker 1>artificial chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not real because everything </v>

257
00:12:06.431 --> 00:12:08.500
<v Speaker 1>is natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's here.</v>

258
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.513
<v Speaker 1>Like it might've been concocted and put </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and baked and cooked and </v>

259
00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:14.890
<v Speaker 1>synthesize by a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course it's all natural.</v>

260
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Everything that's exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antics though,</v>

261
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.593
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't in that these chemicals most </v>

262
00:12:22.811 --> 00:12:26.440
<v Speaker 1>likely have some sort of a corresponding</v>
<v Speaker 1>receptor in the human brain.</v>

263
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or something similar.</v>

264
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Something similar molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

265
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.760
<v Speaker 1>And it's a natural thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the craziest thing about the</v>

266
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:36.700
<v Speaker 1>most potent drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's still assignment or whether</v>

267
00:12:36.701 --> 00:12:37.534
<v Speaker 1>it's dimethyltryptamine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have like really similar </v>

268
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.290
<v Speaker 1>composition did normal human </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurochemistry keys.</v>

269
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Like there are keys that fit a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>lock.</v>

270
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.210
<v Speaker 1>That's how they put it.</v>

271
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do think that there is a </v>

272
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:54.190
<v Speaker 1>distinction between natural and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnatural in the sense that something,</v>

273
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.960
<v Speaker 1>because I get this argument all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

274
00:12:55.961 --> 00:12:56.301
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

275
00:12:56.301 --> 00:12:57.910
<v Speaker 1>people created it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's natural,</v>

276
00:12:57.911 --> 00:13:02.530
<v Speaker 1>but there are things that exist in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural system,</v>

277
00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:06.640
<v Speaker 1>like plastics don't exist in the natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem and therefore they don't break</v>

278
00:13:06.641 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't become part of the food chain</v>

279
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:12.010
<v Speaker 1>in a beneficial way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas things that have existed in that</v>

280
00:13:12.011 --> 00:13:16.810
<v Speaker 1>system for a long time do they fit into </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and I think in terms of drugs,</v>

281
00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:21.790
<v Speaker 1>there are drugs like ghb that exists </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally in the body that we metabolize</v>

282
00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:25.150
<v Speaker 1>absolutely cleanly because the liver </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows exactly what it is.</v>

283
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:30.390
<v Speaker 1>It's prepared to deal with it and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't cause any organic toxicity,</v>

284
00:13:30.401 --> 00:13:31.234
<v Speaker 1>no neurotoxicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there are other things like </v>

285
00:13:32.861 --> 00:13:37.840
<v Speaker 1>alcohol which are natural in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fruits for meant and all that,</v>

286
00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:40.690
<v Speaker 1>but the body doesn't metabolize it </v>
<v Speaker 1>cleanly.</v>

287
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.523
<v Speaker 1>So it damages us in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Particularly if you're from a very </v>

288
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:45.910
<v Speaker 1>specific part of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right where it's a.</v>

289
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.033
<v Speaker 1>If it's not a part of your customer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why it was such a giant issue </v>

290
00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:53.200
<v Speaker 1>when Europeans came here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>

291
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.150
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have any history with </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>

292
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:55.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

293
00:13:55.851 --> 00:13:58.450
<v Speaker 1>you know Hamilton Morris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a device guy.</v>

294
00:13:58.451 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 1>He tweeted this thing I thought was </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty smart.</v>

295
00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Probably a little controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forgive me if I miss quote it,</v>

296
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's something along the lines of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's drugs,</v>

297
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.130
<v Speaker 1>it's drugs and that word is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial word.</v>

298
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Somehow people like to use the term </v>
<v Speaker 1>plant Madison,</v>

299
00:14:12.341 --> 00:14:13.174
<v Speaker 1>which is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can call it plant medicine or you </v>

300
00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:15.784
<v Speaker 1>can call it whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to create a hierarchy based on </v>

301
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.083
<v Speaker 1>synthesis I think is to sort of miss the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point which is that all of these things </v>

302
00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:24.334
<v Speaker 1>are tools and some of them we have more </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a history with humanity and some of </v>

303
00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:30.520
<v Speaker 1>them we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones we don't,</v>

304
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.590
<v Speaker 1>which is my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many.</v>

305
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.570
<v Speaker 1>There's so many new drugs that are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>popping up all the time.</v>

306
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Different derivatives of Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you can like right now apparently</v>

307
00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:46.390
<v Speaker 1>you can order sheets of this stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like Lsd,</v>

308
00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:49.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's in the gray area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still kind of legal,</v>

309
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like a different version of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know</v>

310
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.383
<v Speaker 9>yet the effects it's going to have </v>
<v Speaker 9>because it's not like anyone's really </v>

311
00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:56.564
<v Speaker 9>testing it out.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So I say the name because Jeff sessions </v>

312
00:14:58.131 --> 00:14:58.964
<v Speaker 9>is listening at one hand as you're </v>
<v Speaker 9>writing down little southern big scary </v>

313
00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:14.270
<v Speaker 9>of Jeff sessions at a giant Dick Table.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

314
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.253
<v Speaker 9>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think this talking to a woman who had </v>

315
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:21.280
<v Speaker 9>sex with a little person and she said he</v>
<v Speaker 9>had a normal sized Dick [inaudible] that</v>

316
00:15:21.281 --> 00:15:22.114
<v Speaker 9>big heads.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So Jeff sessions with a normal sized </v>

317
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:28.460
<v Speaker 9>Dick would be interesting </v>
<v Speaker 9>proportionally.</v>

318
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:29.421
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know.</v>

319
00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:33.410
<v Speaker 9>I mean just scary to think about like </v>
<v Speaker 9>that jeff sessions having like some kind</v>

320
00:15:33.411 --> 00:15:34.430
<v Speaker 9>of like.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Because you know,</v>

321
00:15:34.431 --> 00:15:35.480
<v Speaker 9>he's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

322
00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:38.690
<v Speaker 9>he's just such a quintessential pig,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

323
00:15:38.691 --> 00:15:39.524
<v Speaker 9>and it's like you want the </v>
<v Speaker 9>quintessential pig to have some kind of </v>

324
00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:44.960
<v Speaker 9>like to be almost like a unit or </v>
<v Speaker 9>something.</v>

325
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:45.794
<v Speaker 9>But it's terrifying to imagine the jeff </v>
<v Speaker 9>sessions when he takes his clothes off </v>

326
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.533
<v Speaker 9>probably as like six nipples.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was just running right down the </v>

327
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:56.090
<v Speaker 9>middle of his fucking chest.</v>

328
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.823
<v Speaker 9>They usually,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it gets wet when he's like arresting </v>

329
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:04.680
<v Speaker 9>people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They who's the little goat knobs that he</v>

330
00:16:04.681 --> 00:16:08.090
<v Speaker 9>has to fall file down.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Go Nazi pro.</v>

331
00:16:08.091 --> 00:16:11.810
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He's got file private prisons.</v>

332
00:16:11.811 --> 00:16:12.644
<v Speaker 9>He visits private prisons and just pulls</v>
<v Speaker 9>out his massive throbbing cock in front </v>

333
00:16:16.701 --> 00:16:18.650
<v Speaker 9>of people who've been sentenced there </v>
<v Speaker 9>for life.</v>

334
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.340
<v Speaker 9>It's right on that screen that you put </v>
<v Speaker 9>your hand on.</v>

335
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.510
<v Speaker 9>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Sessions.</v>

336
00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:26.330
<v Speaker 9>I was standing up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I just want you to know that going after</v>

337
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 9>medical marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 9>again,</v>

338
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.660
<v Speaker 9>it's trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's almost like he can't help himself.</v>

339
00:16:29.661 --> 00:16:33.020
<v Speaker 9>He knows what the laws are and it's </v>
<v Speaker 9>almost like I just want to grab them.</v>

340
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.240
<v Speaker 9>Let me just grab,</v>
<v Speaker 9>just grab them.</v>

341
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.560
<v Speaker 9>I know what science says,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I've got my personal opinions on the</v>

342
00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:40.394
<v Speaker 9>thing and that's what matters.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Just anytime there's one person who has </v>

343
00:16:44.091 --> 00:16:44.924
<v Speaker 9>authority over another person and </v>
<v Speaker 9>they've lived an entire life in that </v>

344
00:16:47.481 --> 00:16:47.990
<v Speaker 9>position.</v>

345
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.020
<v Speaker 9>That's their ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Their ecosystem is they have authority,</v>

346
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.970
<v Speaker 9>they enforce laws,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they lock people up.</v>

347
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:56.480
<v Speaker 9>They put in this the game that gets the </v>
<v Speaker 9>game they play and be successful.</v>

348
00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:57.680
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Not just that.</v>

349
00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:58.723
<v Speaker 9>It's like there's an objective.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's literally like almost like a </v>

350
00:17:00.681 --> 00:17:03.500
<v Speaker 9>monopoly game,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like you see what the thing is to arrest</v>

351
00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:04.580
<v Speaker 9>people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're,</v>

352
00:17:04.581 --> 00:17:07.460
<v Speaker 9>you're the guy who arrest people,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you arrest people and convict people.</v>

353
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:08.870
<v Speaker 9>That's your game.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's what you do.</v>

354
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:09.733
<v Speaker 9>You're plugged into the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Do you know an interesting thing about </v>

355
00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:12.794
<v Speaker 9>monopoly?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was invented by an anarchist who was </v>

356
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:20.660
<v Speaker 9>invented it to teach kids the evils of </v>
<v Speaker 9>capitalism.</v>

357
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.210
<v Speaker 9>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Really?</v>

358
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:24.320
<v Speaker 9>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Goofy.</v>

359
00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:28.120
<v Speaker 9>Anarchists are the exact opposite thing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like what they do to it.</v>

360
00:17:28.121 --> 00:17:31.340
<v Speaker 9>It wasn't supposed to be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was supposed to demonstrate that when</v>

361
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:33.320
<v Speaker 9>you accumulate capital,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you ended up taking it.</v>

362
00:17:33.321 --> 00:17:34.940
<v Speaker 9>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Wait,</v>

363
00:17:34.941 --> 00:17:36.200
<v Speaker 9>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 9>And Arkansas.</v>

364
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.273
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think that anarchistic or people who </v>

365
00:17:38.571 --> 00:17:39.404
<v Speaker 9>want to diminish this system that we </v>
<v Speaker 9>have have far less rules have far less </v>

366
00:17:44.691 --> 00:17:45.850
<v Speaker 9>government.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

367
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 9>And usually they're kind of spastic and</v>

368
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:50.851
<v Speaker 8>their,</v>
<v Speaker 8>their,</v>

369
00:17:50.851 --> 00:17:51.684
<v Speaker 8>their,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the way they express themselves is </v>

370
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:53.750
<v Speaker 8>always like very awkward</v>

371
00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.950
<v Speaker 2>court like Libertarians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

372
00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:57.873
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

373
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.843
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've just been reading this book </v>

374
00:17:59.691 --> 00:18:01.220
<v Speaker 2>are a narco syndicate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Realism.</v>

375
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot dance.</v>

376
00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.453
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting to look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of anarchism like when it comes </v>

377
00:18:07.131 --> 00:18:07.964
<v Speaker 2>from versus what it gets interrupt </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I remember when I was in high </v>

378
00:18:10.701 --> 00:18:11.534
<v Speaker 2>school or do you remember drawing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking anarchy symbol and you'd be </v>

379
00:18:13.751 --> 00:18:18.490
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah man didn't even know what it made.</v>

380
00:18:18.491 --> 00:18:20.300
<v Speaker 2>You're just assuming you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

381
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:25.330
<v Speaker 2>but I think one part of it that's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful is the idea that we don't need</v>

382
00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:27.613
<v Speaker 2>withered old prunes like jeff sessions </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling us what we can put in our </v>

383
00:18:31.521 --> 00:18:32.690
<v Speaker 2>bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need that.</v>

384
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:33.531
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

385
00:18:33.531 --> 00:18:34.130
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

386
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:34.963
<v Speaker 2>and that how many jeff sessions are </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and the power structure and then </v>

387
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.080
<v Speaker 2>where it gets really fucking cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Check out David Graber.</v>

388
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.820
<v Speaker 2>You should have him on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My God,</v>

389
00:18:43.821 --> 00:18:45.820
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking brilliant what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

390
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.490
<v Speaker 2>He's an author and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a philosopher,</v>

391
00:18:49.491 --> 00:18:51.100
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

392
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.530
<v Speaker 2>he is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he wrote a book called,</v>

393
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.920
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called the Utopia of rules </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've been reading,</v>

394
00:18:57.921 --> 00:19:02.530
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty fucking bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just sort of breaking down like</v>

395
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.200
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

396
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.670
<v Speaker 2>the bureaucracy that we're in right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bureaucracy,</v>

397
00:19:07.671 --> 00:19:08.504
<v Speaker 2>all the fucking forms you got to fill </v>
<v Speaker 2>out to do just about anything these </v>

398
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:11.830
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all these fucking forums.</v>

399
00:19:11.831 --> 00:19:12.830
<v Speaker 2>It's insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

400
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.673
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then where it gets really </v>

401
00:19:14.481 --> 00:19:19.481
<v Speaker 2>interesting is he's right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like in like communists states the,</v>

402
00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.413
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

403
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.830
<v Speaker 2>the corporations in the state are kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the same thing.</v>

404
00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:29.780
<v Speaker 2>So there's these like Ministry of Labor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stores are all national stores,</v>

405
00:19:29.781 --> 00:19:30.614
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we think that that's not what's </v>

406
00:19:32.391 --> 00:19:33.260
<v Speaker 2>happening right now.</v>

407
00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.170
<v Speaker 2>But actually because the people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>

408
00:19:36.171 --> 00:19:37.004
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the corporations used to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>government and the people who are in </v>

409
00:19:40.521 --> 00:19:42.800
<v Speaker 2>government used to be running these big </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporations.</v>

410
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:43.993
<v Speaker 2>One of the cool points he makes and also</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the government is making the </v>

411
00:19:46.851 --> 00:19:49.280
<v Speaker 2>rules that the corporations are working </v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

412
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.280
<v Speaker 2>but the corporations are putting their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own agents into the state.</v>

413
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:53.443
<v Speaker 2>He saying the actually the line between </v>
<v Speaker 2>the state and private companies is </v>

414
00:19:56.901 --> 00:19:57.734
<v Speaker 2>really blurry right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're kind of merging together </v>

415
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.513
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we like to pretend that there are </v>

416
00:20:02.741 --> 00:20:03.980
<v Speaker 2>separate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

417
00:20:03.981 --> 00:20:04.814
<v Speaker 2>what's happening right now with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking fcc trying to take away the </v>

418
00:20:07.521 --> 00:20:08.354
<v Speaker 2>internet with verizon having one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their fucking pig drones in a </v>

419
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.633
<v Speaker 2>superposition of power right now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to take away the freedom of the </v>

420
00:20:15.771 --> 00:20:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The state can be like we.</v>

421
00:20:18.271 --> 00:20:20.000
<v Speaker 2>The corporations can blame it on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

422
00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.160
<v Speaker 2>It's just clarifying by what</v>

423
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:21.993
<v Speaker 8>you mean by that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because they're not trying to take away </v>

424
00:20:23.081 --> 00:20:27.310
<v Speaker 8>the freedom of the Internet to try and </v>
<v Speaker 8>to try and get rid of net neutrality.</v>

425
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.270
<v Speaker 8>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

426
00:20:28.271 --> 00:20:32.020
<v Speaker 8>So what did it mean is that you will </v>
<v Speaker 8>have to probably pay more.</v>

427
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.873
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>To access things that require more </v>

428
00:20:34.631 --> 00:20:37.300
<v Speaker 8>bandwidth and it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not.</v>

429
00:20:37.301 --> 00:20:42.010
<v Speaker 8>It's going to be what it is now where </v>
<v Speaker 8>every website has open access it you two</v>

430
00:20:42.011 --> 00:20:42.581
<v Speaker 8>versions,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

431
00:20:42.581 --> 00:20:44.980
<v Speaker 8>You get the capitalist version.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it's a good idea,</v>

432
00:20:44.981 --> 00:20:47.470
<v Speaker 8>and then you get the tech version,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which thinks is terrible idea.</v>

433
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 8>I almost</v>

434
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.000
<v Speaker 9>always go towards the tech for.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

435
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.303
<v Speaker 9>but that's the Anaconda.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know the way an Anaconda kills </v>

436
00:20:52.981 --> 00:20:53.814
<v Speaker 9>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 9>every time you exhale it squeezes in a </v>

437
00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:57.150
<v Speaker 9>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's all.</v>

438
00:20:57.151 --> 00:20:59.170
<v Speaker 9>Like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's the squeeze in as,</v>

439
00:20:59.171 --> 00:21:01.270
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this fucking Internet.</v>

440
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.750
<v Speaker 9>It sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If you're somebody like jeff sessions,</v>

441
00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:05.584
<v Speaker 9>that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's not where the money's coming </v>

442
00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:08.410
<v Speaker 9>from.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think you're misinterpreting the whole</v>

443
00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:10.150
<v Speaker 9>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's all just a business thing.</v>

444
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.970
<v Speaker 9>It's like being able to throttle the </v>
<v Speaker 9>data and being able to decide like,</v>

445
00:21:14.971 --> 00:21:15.804
<v Speaker 9>like if Netflix wants you on there,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you want to have netflix on the </v>

446
00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:20.014
<v Speaker 9>network,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they want to be able to work out some </v>

447
00:21:21.011 --> 00:21:21.844
<v Speaker 9>sort of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They don't want to treat netflix like </v>

448
00:21:22.811 --> 00:21:24.200
<v Speaker 9>it's any other sort of streaming </v>
<v Speaker 9>service.</v>

449
00:21:24.201 --> 00:21:25.120
<v Speaker 9>Like you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

450
00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.173
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

451
00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.253
<v Speaker 9>the business transactions.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So they're looking at in a business </v>

452
00:21:29.261 --> 00:21:31.240
<v Speaker 9>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they're not saying the internet sucks.</v>

453
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.460
<v Speaker 9>No one is trying to like squeeze the </v>
<v Speaker 9>Internet,</v>

454
00:21:33.461 --> 00:21:35.590
<v Speaker 9>stop it with the trying to do is make </v>
<v Speaker 9>more money.</v>

455
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.191
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>

456
00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:37.140
<v Speaker 9>great.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They're trying,</v>

457
00:21:37.141 --> 00:21:37.671
<v Speaker 9>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

458
00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 9>I do here.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I do know what you're saying,</v>

459
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:40.024
<v Speaker 9>but I think it's a slippery slope and </v>
<v Speaker 9>it's that idea of the Internet being </v>

460
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:44.690
<v Speaker 9>treated like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know,</v>

461
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.543
<v Speaker 9>water,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the Internet being treated like just a </v>

462
00:21:47.051 --> 00:21:47.884
<v Speaker 9>thing that no corporation should have </v>
<v Speaker 9>any kind of say that that to me it has </v>

463
00:21:53.501 --> 00:21:57.420
<v Speaker 9>to stay like that because the moment </v>
<v Speaker 9>some corporation,</v>

464
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:59.140
<v Speaker 9>whoever it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it gets to start deciding,</v>

465
00:21:59.141 --> 00:21:59.974
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you guys need to pay a little bit more </v>

466
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.433
<v Speaker 9>and if we establish that corporations in</v>
<v Speaker 9>the state aren't as separate as we like </v>

467
00:22:05.801 --> 00:22:06.634
<v Speaker 9>to think,</v>
<v Speaker 9>then suddenly there's all kinds of back </v>

468
00:22:08.081 --> 00:22:08.914
<v Speaker 9>channels there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Suddenly there becomes a new way to </v>

469
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:14.440
<v Speaker 9>begin to filter out content and you </v>
<v Speaker 9>could say it's for money.</v>

470
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.513
<v Speaker 9>You start building financial walls </v>
<v Speaker 9>around things and you start making </v>

471
00:22:18.041 --> 00:22:18.874
<v Speaker 9>things vanished into the background </v>
<v Speaker 9>because they aren't in some big </v>

472
00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:25.480
<v Speaker 9>conglomerate that's paying off the </v>
<v Speaker 9>corporations more or whatever.</v>

473
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.480
<v Speaker 9>You just mess up the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which as far as I can tell,</v>

474
00:22:28.481 --> 00:22:30.200
<v Speaker 9>it's doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The Internet.</v>

475
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.113
<v Speaker 9>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 9>This fucking compound you're in right </v>

476
00:22:32.681 --> 00:22:33.970
<v Speaker 9>now,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

477
00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.940
<v Speaker 9>a lot of it came from the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 9>This thing we're doing right now,</v>

478
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:38.650
<v Speaker 9>it's the way the Internet's been </v>
<v Speaker 9>working.</v>

479
00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:39.603
<v Speaker 9>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 9>No one's a bigger proponent of the </v>

480
00:22:40.601 --> 00:22:41.434
<v Speaker 9>internet than I am.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I just think when we're talking about </v>

481
00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:43.750
<v Speaker 9>these issues,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you've got to be.</v>

482
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.950
<v Speaker 9>You've got to be really like objective.</v>
<v Speaker 9>What's trying to happen here.</v>

483
00:22:47.951 --> 00:22:50.770
<v Speaker 9>They're not trying to silence dissent.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They're just trying to,</v>

484
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:52.023
<v Speaker 9>trying to make as much money as possible</v>
<v Speaker 9>and this is a weird tricky time when it </v>

485
00:22:55.871 --> 00:22:59.950
<v Speaker 9>comes to information and we do have to </v>
<v Speaker 9>be very careful because it could wind up</v>

486
00:22:59.951 --> 00:23:00.790
<v Speaker 9>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Hey,</v>

487
00:23:00.791 --> 00:23:02.690
<v Speaker 9>you get your internet from comcast will.</v>

488
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.920
<v Speaker 9>Comcast is no longer allow,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

489
00:23:05.921 --> 00:23:06.754
<v Speaker 9>Blah Blah Blah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The laugh app that has your podcast </v>

490
00:23:08.291 --> 00:23:11.080
<v Speaker 9>featured on it or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>some new streaming service.</v>

491
00:23:11.081 --> 00:23:13.900
<v Speaker 9>It's yet to be discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That will be in the future.</v>

492
00:23:13.901 --> 00:23:16.600
<v Speaker 9>Challenging Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So youtube gets together with Google,</v>

493
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:17.543
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they're owned by Google and they get </v>

494
00:23:18.341 --> 00:23:22.090
<v Speaker 9>together with verizon and they make it </v>
<v Speaker 9>exclusive for the verizon network.</v>

495
00:23:22.091 --> 00:23:25.600
<v Speaker 9>If you want to get on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you have to be on the verizon network.</v>

496
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:26.460
<v Speaker 9>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's.</v>

497
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.320
<v Speaker 9>This is all inside the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 9>possibility.</v>

498
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:29.650
<v Speaker 9>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The deeper level though,</v>

499
00:23:29.651 --> 00:23:30.484
<v Speaker 9>anybody who thinks that government has </v>
<v Speaker 9>not been totally captured by </v>

500
00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:35.920
<v Speaker 9>corporations isn't paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

501
00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:36.754
<v Speaker 9>that's not news in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You come from Europe where this is one </v>

502
00:23:40.091 --> 00:23:40.924
<v Speaker 9>of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the problems I have with anarchists and </v>

503
00:23:41.941 --> 00:23:42.774
<v Speaker 9>Libertarians.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think they're very naive about what </v>

504
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 9>the world would</v>

505
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.350
<v Speaker 3>look like if there were no government </v>
<v Speaker 3>regulation.</v>

506
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.213
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

507
00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.190
<v Speaker 3>Every poison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every river would be to poison,</v>

508
00:23:52.191 --> 00:23:53.570
<v Speaker 3>to swim in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

509
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.690
<v Speaker 3>the air would be fucking because </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporations,</v>

510
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.553
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense for them to dump their </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit as near to the factory as possible </v>

511
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.823
<v Speaker 3>and don't give a fuck about birth </v>
<v Speaker 3>defects and dead people that it doesn't </v>

512
00:24:04.581 --> 00:24:06.160
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

513
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.660
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of good things come from from </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

514
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.210
<v Speaker 3>from a lot of anarchistic a theorists </v>
<v Speaker 3>and and,</v>

515
00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.640
<v Speaker 3>and some of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

516
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.553
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of it relates back to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit with a hunter gatherers because </v>

517
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.390
<v Speaker 3>hunter gathers are essentially anarchist</v>
<v Speaker 3>functioning anarchists.</v>

518
00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.480
<v Speaker 3>The problem is when you scale up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got corporations that,</v>

519
00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.493
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about this on this podcast </v>

520
00:24:26.541 --> 00:24:27.374
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what my idea that my belief that </v>

521
00:24:29.091 --> 00:24:32.720
<v Speaker 3>corporations are living things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>institutions are living things and their</v>

522
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:35.610
<v Speaker 3>agendas conflict with like super </v>
<v Speaker 3>organisms are.</v>

523
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:36.523
<v Speaker 3>Sounds Spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that every time you get large </v>

524
00:24:39.351 --> 00:24:40.184
<v Speaker 3>groups of people together and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>operate under one window or one </v>

525
00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:42.914
<v Speaker 3>umbrella,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather,</v>

526
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.820
<v Speaker 3>they just tend to act like one organism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just what countries do.</v>

527
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:48.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

528
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.930
<v Speaker 3>it's a natural thing that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>do for some strange reason,</v>

529
00:24:50.931 --> 00:24:52.090
<v Speaker 3>not only human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

530
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Think about flocks of birds and fish and</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

531
00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:59.270
<v Speaker 3>and hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are all sorts of examples and then</v>

532
00:24:59.271 --> 00:25:02.360
<v Speaker 3>you go the other direction are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are a microbiome,</v>

533
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:03.423
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's all functioning according </v>

534
00:25:05.061 --> 00:25:06.560
<v Speaker 3>to its own systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

535
00:25:06.561 --> 00:25:07.394
<v Speaker 3>And then that's happening within us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's all sorts of scalable stuff </v>

536
00:25:11.001 --> 00:25:12.500
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd be insane.</v>

537
00:25:12.501 --> 00:25:13.334
<v Speaker 3>Did not think there needs to be some </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of structure to help things </v>

538
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.233
<v Speaker 3>function smoothly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think we all agree we don't need </v>

539
00:25:20.931 --> 00:25:23.360
<v Speaker 3>as much structure as we've got right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot.</v>

540
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.920
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry to interrupt,</v>

541
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.323
<v Speaker 3>just to finish the point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what happens is a lot of people </v>

542
00:25:28.551 --> 00:25:29.384
<v Speaker 3>get in their heads and they start </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking that the state is responsible </v>

543
00:25:33.351 --> 00:25:36.060
<v Speaker 3>in some way or another for their </v>
<v Speaker 3>wellbeing and that.</v>

544
00:25:36.061 --> 00:25:36.894
<v Speaker 3>And that's what happens is you start </v>
<v Speaker 3>forgetting that if what's really </v>

545
00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:41.684
<v Speaker 3>important is communities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's really important is finding a </v>

546
00:25:43.521 --> 00:25:44.354
<v Speaker 3>group of people that you love and </v>
<v Speaker 3>deciding in this group of people </v>

547
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.140
<v Speaker 3>loosely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a commune.</v>

548
00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:50.983
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a cult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just deciding what the group of </v>

549
00:25:53.121 --> 00:25:55.670
<v Speaker 3>people that you have making this really </v>
<v Speaker 3>intense decision,</v>

550
00:25:55.671 --> 00:25:58.400
<v Speaker 3>which is none of us are ever going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>homeless.</v>

551
00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.070
<v Speaker 3>You could start there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That used to be what the family was,</v>

552
00:26:01.071 --> 00:26:02.630
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people don't have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

553
00:26:02.631 --> 00:26:03.464
<v Speaker 3>So groups of people agreeing very </v>
<v Speaker 3>loosely to take care of each other and </v>

554
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.943
<v Speaker 3>in a way that the state is currently </v>
<v Speaker 3>functioning with welfare and all that </v>

555
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:12.890
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

556
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.830
<v Speaker 3>That's to me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not anarchy,</v>

557
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a sense of soul,</v>

558
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:18.493
<v Speaker 3>like shrugging off the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>state is really going to take care of </v>

559
00:26:22.431 --> 00:26:23.264
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what if the state is an expression </v>

560
00:26:25.071 --> 00:26:28.730
<v Speaker 3>of that sense of community as it is in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>country like Denmark for example,</v>

561
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.950
<v Speaker 3>were Danish people and Dutch people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Swedish people and you know,</v>

562
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:34.720
<v Speaker 3>lots of northern European countries </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

563
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not gonna.</v>

564
00:26:35.841 --> 00:26:36.674
<v Speaker 3>Let anyone be homeless and suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to let any children be </v>

565
00:26:40.461 --> 00:26:43.070
<v Speaker 3>malnourished in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to take care of each other.</v>

566
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 3>It depends on how</v>

567
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.541
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

568
00:26:44.541 --> 00:26:46.710
<v Speaker 2>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was a pure expression,</v>

569
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:47.573
<v Speaker 2>if for one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the people are unified enough to </v>

570
00:26:49.381 --> 00:26:53.750
<v Speaker 2>create a pure expression of what they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're like central goals were,</v>

571
00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:57.810
<v Speaker 2>that would be pretty startling to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we pay lip service to America all</v>

572
00:26:57.811 --> 00:26:58.561
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

573
00:26:58.561 --> 00:27:01.200
<v Speaker 2>thanks for your service and we're all in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this together.</v>

574
00:27:01.201 --> 00:27:02.550
<v Speaker 2>We're all Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

575
00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:03.870
<v Speaker 2>rally around the flag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

576
00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:04.704
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

577
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.030
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

578
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.850
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to create this sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

579
00:27:08.851 --> 00:27:09.684
<v Speaker 2>We're all in it together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to actually taking </v>

580
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:14.160
<v Speaker 2>care of each other than we don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

581
00:27:14.161 --> 00:27:15.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the list.</v>

582
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.850
<v Speaker 2>Let me say them as natively stupid </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

583
00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:19.140
<v Speaker 2>I was just thinking about this in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way ever.</v>

584
00:27:19.141 --> 00:27:19.974
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is so dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was really thinking this because </v>

585
00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:22.584
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prisoners are fighting the fires </v>

586
00:27:24.031 --> 00:27:24.631
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

587
00:27:24.631 --> 00:27:27.000
<v Speaker 2>that is that prisoners.</v>

588
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.780
<v Speaker 2>They're getting paid $1 an hour to fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fires were there.</v>

589
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:31.763
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was just thinking to myself like </v>

590
00:27:33.921 --> 00:27:35.700
<v Speaker 2>dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no $1 an hour.</v>

591
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.220
<v Speaker 2>But I was thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

592
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.870
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if like everybody in California was</v>

593
00:27:42.871 --> 00:27:43.411
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

594
00:27:43.411 --> 00:27:48.280
<v Speaker 2>there's fires and we all were going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>help fight the fires would,</v>

595
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.000
<v Speaker 2>would we all be able to put the fires </v>
<v Speaker 2>out?</v>

596
00:27:51.001 --> 00:27:51.834
<v Speaker 2>Like if like as many just people just </v>
<v Speaker 2>started flooding to actually go help or </v>

597
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.790
<v Speaker 2>if like all these homes are burned down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was just thinking like,</v>

598
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.190
<v Speaker 2>shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If like everybody in California is like,</v>

599
00:28:02.191 --> 00:28:03.024
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just go help them build their </v>

600
00:28:03.691 --> 00:28:05.430
<v Speaker 2>houses back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

601
00:28:05.431 --> 00:28:06.264
<v Speaker 2>it's so insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also fall apart if you are building </v>

602
00:28:07.711 --> 00:28:10.730
<v Speaker 2>a house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust will start building out.</v>

603
00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:11.630
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

604
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:16.560
<v Speaker 2>nothing's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's the fuck did you do.</v>

605
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:18.540
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be in charge of the.</v>

606
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.370
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be in charge of building the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking houses.</v>

607
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Like sandwiches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make sandwiches,</v>

608
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.290
<v Speaker 2>which is another cool thing that I like </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

609
00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:26.124
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fucking nras but one cool </v>

610
00:28:27.661 --> 00:28:31.140
<v Speaker 2>thing I like about the idea is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now we have this hierarchy of uh,</v>

611
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of have like careers,</v>

612
00:28:34.021 --> 00:28:37.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So doctors are valued more than somebody</v>

613
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.910
<v Speaker 2>who plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plumber,</v>

614
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:42.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or plumbers are plumbers are valued more</v>

615
00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:43.910
<v Speaker 2>than like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

616
00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.660
<v Speaker 2>a house cleaner or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

617
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:46.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's considered a low status thing if </v>

618
00:28:48.721 --> 00:28:51.870
<v Speaker 2>you're somebody who works in a fast food</v>
<v Speaker 2>joint or something like that.</v>

619
00:28:51.871 --> 00:28:55.680
<v Speaker 2>But when you get together with a group </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people who are fucking cool,</v>

620
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.250
<v Speaker 2>some people are good at some things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are good at other things,</v>

621
00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:00.383
<v Speaker 2>but nobody is valued more than the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>person because everybody loves each </v>

622
00:29:04.171 --> 00:29:04.410
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

623
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:05.870
<v Speaker 2>And you've got this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>

624
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person who's the most,</v>

625
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.680
<v Speaker 2>like somebody digging trenches to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>put electrical wires down,</v>

626
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.423
<v Speaker 2>a pretty unskilled job is super </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciated because who the fuck wants </v>

627
00:29:17.791 --> 00:29:21.450
<v Speaker 2>to dig the trenches managed when you add</v>
<v Speaker 2>money to the equation,</v>

628
00:29:21.451 --> 00:29:23.610
<v Speaker 2>which is what we're doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I get it.</v>

629
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying get rid of money or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

630
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.170
<v Speaker 2>When you add money to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything gets fucking weird.</v>

631
00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:33.120
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm saying is it's just a right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now when we hear about the fires,</v>

632
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:34.051
<v Speaker 2>we think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

633
00:29:34.051 --> 00:29:35.790
<v Speaker 2>I'll donate some money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll donate some money.</v>

634
00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:37.170
<v Speaker 2>That'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll do it.</v>

635
00:29:37.171 --> 00:29:39.090
<v Speaker 2>I'll donate some money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is,</v>

636
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.070
<v Speaker 2>like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy naive.</v>

637
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 2>I just had this image</v>

638
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.420
<v Speaker 9>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>fuck,</v>

639
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:48.750
<v Speaker 9>what if just huge groups of people </v>
<v Speaker 9>started going towards the fires in blood</v>

640
00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:51.890
<v Speaker 9>cells,</v>
<v Speaker 9>contaminants that.</v>

641
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.903
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Because right now we're using prisoners </v>

642
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:55.023
<v Speaker 9>will do you understand the terrain?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like this is not something that most </v>

643
00:29:57.221 --> 00:29:58.054
<v Speaker 9>people can traverse.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're talking about like extremely </v>

644
00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:04.000
<v Speaker 9>hilly areas that are also you.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You'd have to be not just fit,</v>

645
00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:06.430
<v Speaker 9>but you'd have to understand which way </v>
<v Speaker 9>the wind's blowing.</v>

646
00:30:06.431 --> 00:30:09.460
<v Speaker 9>You could get shoe horned in and </v>
<v Speaker 9>surrounded by fire.</v>

647
00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.000
<v Speaker 9>There's a lot of like serious dangers </v>
<v Speaker 9>with them.</v>

648
00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.440
<v Speaker 9>It's a beautiful idea on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We need trained.</v>

649
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:15.760
<v Speaker 9>There'd have to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It would never.</v>

650
00:30:15.761 --> 00:30:18.590
<v Speaker 9>I know it never fucking happen.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's just clear.</v>

651
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.070
<v Speaker 9>You would need a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Someone would have to organize.</v>

652
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:26.100
<v Speaker 9>It was supposed to be bigger than this </v>
<v Speaker 9>than the city of Washington DC.</v>

653
00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.280
<v Speaker 9>Now I know how big the fucking bad.</v>

654
00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.870
<v Speaker 9>I mean it's insane how big it is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's terrible.</v>

655
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:32.704
<v Speaker 9>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You'd have to get a lot of fucking </v>

656
00:30:33.971 --> 00:30:35.980
<v Speaker 9>people to circle that bit,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but we're just so.</v>

657
00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.340
<v Speaker 9>We're so.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We're so broken apart.</v>

658
00:30:39.341 --> 00:30:40.174
<v Speaker 9>We're so disconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like whenever you hear about something </v>

659
00:30:42.341 --> 00:30:45.100
<v Speaker 9>going down,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's just a thing that's going down.</v>

660
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.100
<v Speaker 9>If someone's house is burnt down,</v>
<v Speaker 9>your that fucking house burnt down,</v>

661
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:49.323
<v Speaker 9>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You don't really think much more than </v>

662
00:30:50.321 --> 00:30:54.040
<v Speaker 9>that and we think the state is going to </v>
<v Speaker 9>come in and like take care of everything</v>

663
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:58.360
<v Speaker 9>and I think that's what the state wants.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I love using the term this state.</v>

664
00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:02.440
<v Speaker 9>Does the state want that or is just how </v>
<v Speaker 9>it's structured now at wants it,</v>

665
00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:03.323
<v Speaker 9>but the state wants to because in the </v>
<v Speaker 9>same reason anyone who's in an abusive </v>

666
00:31:07.061 --> 00:31:07.894
<v Speaker 9>relationship wants to be in control.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like if you think that I'm the one </v>

667
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.260
<v Speaker 9>who's going to help you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>then you're dependent on me.</v>

668
00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.200
<v Speaker 9>And do you think if the.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If there was a really effective,</v>

669
00:31:17.201 --> 00:31:21.250
<v Speaker 9>massive volunteer firefighter force,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the state would resist that?</v>

670
00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:22.340
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't.</v>

671
00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.173
<v Speaker 9>That's what's beautiful about it is I </v>
<v Speaker 9>don't know how the state would resist </v>

672
00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:27.184
<v Speaker 9>that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean we do see the state resisting </v>

673
00:31:28.001 --> 00:31:31.720
<v Speaker 9>things like groups of people getting </v>
<v Speaker 9>together and trying to feed the homeless</v>

674
00:31:31.721 --> 00:31:33.060
<v Speaker 9>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

675
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:36.700
<v Speaker 9>Rather they resist last popups and you </v>
<v Speaker 9>can't feed them like that.</v>

676
00:31:36.701 --> 00:31:41.140
<v Speaker 9>There's a lot of licenses you need </v>
<v Speaker 9>licenses to feed people.</v>

677
00:31:41.141 --> 00:31:43.360
<v Speaker 9>You got to fill out forms baby.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But isn't that.</v>

678
00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:44.223
<v Speaker 9>Would that be a good idea to prevent </v>
<v Speaker 9>people from poisoning people or people </v>

679
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:50.160
<v Speaker 9>giving them bad food or.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

680
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.690
<v Speaker 9>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know for sure man,</v>

681
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:56.260
<v Speaker 9>but when was the last time you heard </v>
<v Speaker 9>about like an organized group like food?</v>

682
00:31:56.261 --> 00:31:57.094
<v Speaker 9>Not Bombs poisoning.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Homeless people wouldn't have to be </v>

683
00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:00.460
<v Speaker 9>that.</v>

684
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.510
<v Speaker 9>It would be Duncan's food delivery </v>
<v Speaker 9>service,</v>

685
00:32:02.511 --> 00:32:05.770
<v Speaker 9>so you just started out.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You might might have good intentions,</v>

686
00:32:05.771 --> 00:32:08.350
<v Speaker 9>but not really be qualified to prepare </v>
<v Speaker 9>food.</v>

687
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.050
<v Speaker 9>People are eating fucking hamburgers at </v>
<v Speaker 9>a trashcan.</v>

688
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.490
<v Speaker 9>Definitely better than what they're </v>
<v Speaker 9>eating.</v>

689
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.353
<v Speaker 9>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I know the real issue with homeless </v>

690
00:32:15.341 --> 00:32:17.620
<v Speaker 9>people is not just an economic issue </v>
<v Speaker 9>though.</v>

691
00:32:17.621 --> 00:32:21.250
<v Speaker 9>The one of the big ones needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 9>addressed as mental health and when they</v>

692
00:32:21.251 --> 00:32:23.320
<v Speaker 9>changed the standards during the Reagan </v>
<v Speaker 9>administration,</v>

693
00:32:23.321 --> 00:32:27.470
<v Speaker 9>they essentially just sent people out on</v>
<v Speaker 9>the street and they were using Duncan.</v>

694
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:30.970
<v Speaker 9>The argument you're making basically,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is that the state is providing for</v>

695
00:32:30.971 --> 00:32:32.020
<v Speaker 9>people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They should be.</v>

696
00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:34.210
<v Speaker 9>There should be private church </v>
<v Speaker 9>communities,</v>

697
00:32:34.211 --> 00:32:37.300
<v Speaker 9>religious based families.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That was the argument they made.</v>

698
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 9>I think it was disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think it was just about taking money.</v>

699
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

700
00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:43.040
<v Speaker 3>This is about giving it to the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>Reagan thing.</v>

701
00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:43.874
<v Speaker 3>What we're seeing now is the fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bitter fruit of the Reagan </v>

702
00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:47.264
<v Speaker 3>Revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're still using the same economic </v>

703
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:50.330
<v Speaker 3>arguments that's trickled down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

704
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was started.</v>

705
00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:53.870
<v Speaker 3>I most listeners probably aren't old </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to remember this,</v>

706
00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:57.160
<v Speaker 3>but I remember in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>David Stockman was the,</v>

707
00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:00.560
<v Speaker 3>the economic advisor did Ronald Reagan </v>
<v Speaker 3>who came up with all this stuff.</v>

708
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.650
<v Speaker 3>Four or five years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he left the administration.</v>

709
00:33:03.651 --> 00:33:05.210
<v Speaker 3>He came out and said that was all </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

710
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.300
<v Speaker 3>We knew it was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a story we made up.</v>

711
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:10.970
<v Speaker 3>It has makes no economic sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ruining the country.</v>

712
00:33:10.971 --> 00:33:12.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

713
00:33:12.951 --> 00:33:13.784
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and but they're still using it because </v>

714
00:33:15.411 --> 00:33:18.330
<v Speaker 3>it's a narrative that's effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

715
00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.273
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting into this a lot recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how narratives are popular and </v>

716
00:33:25.011 --> 00:33:28.070
<v Speaker 3>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not because they make sense,</v>

717
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.293
<v Speaker 3>but because they create a story that </v>
<v Speaker 3>justifies the power structure that's in </v>

718
00:33:34.341 --> 00:33:35.420
<v Speaker 3>control at the time.</v>

719
00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:36.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

720
00:33:36.731 --> 00:33:37.320
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

721
00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.153
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why I think it's like hyper </v>

722
00:33:39.051 --> 00:33:39.884
<v Speaker 3>important right now for people to find </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups of people that they love and do </v>

723
00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:44.354
<v Speaker 3>more than just like play board games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like getting together with people and </v>

724
00:33:47.391 --> 00:33:50.270
<v Speaker 3>like make stuff like face the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

725
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.313
<v Speaker 3>Fucking California is on fire right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean everyone thinks this shit just </v>

726
00:33:54.561 --> 00:33:56.990
<v Speaker 3>stays the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just on fire,</v>

727
00:33:56.991 --> 00:33:59.380
<v Speaker 3>it's on fire in a way that you realized </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

728
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:00.253
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be twice as bad as this and we </v>

729
00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:02.654
<v Speaker 3>would literally have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone would have to flee the state </v>

730
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.170
<v Speaker 3>and it's December.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

731
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.700
<v Speaker 3>this is the rainy season and it easily </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be twice as bad as it is now.</v>

732
00:34:10.701 --> 00:34:11.534
<v Speaker 3>We're just mean we're in a weird place </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's no rain in the rain is </v>

<v Speaker 3>like it sucks that people have to.</v>

736
00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:20.743
<v Speaker 3>You have to create in your mind the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality of what's happening to my </v>

737
00:34:24.171 --> 00:34:25.010
<v Speaker 3>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he was right by the fires and he's </v>

739
00:34:27.771 --> 00:34:30.920
<v Speaker 3>saying people just can't understand how </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad this is.</v>

740
00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:35.690
<v Speaker 3>People just can't comprehend it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people because this is,</v>

741
00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.130
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like,</v>

742
00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:42.110
<v Speaker 3>this is real life right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you guys feel like this,</v>

743
00:34:42.111 --> 00:34:44.210
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and other things that are happening,</v>

744
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.463
<v Speaker 3>do you feel like this is the shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting the fan in a way that always </v>

745
00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:50.180
<v Speaker 3>seemed hypothetical?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

746
00:34:50.181 --> 00:34:51.014
<v Speaker 3>like this is to me that we're living </v>
<v Speaker 3>through a moment that's almost like </v>

747
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:58.160
<v Speaker 3>aliens arriving in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like something that you always thought,</v>

748
00:34:58.161 --> 00:34:59.360
<v Speaker 3>well that would be weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

749
00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.240
<v Speaker 3>It's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's happening right now.</v>

750
00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.453
<v Speaker 3>It's like there are things happening now</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seemed inconceivable even five </v>

751
00:35:07.251 --> 00:35:08.840
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago.</v>

752
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember what specific.</v>

754
00:35:14.931 --> 00:35:15.764
<v Speaker 3>few times that I've thought of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump president is the main thing of </v>

755
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:21.680
<v Speaker 3>course.</v>

<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

757
00:35:22.371 --> 00:35:23.204
<v Speaker 3>these national monuments were selling </v>
<v Speaker 3>them to those mining company that now </v>

758
00:35:26.121 --> 00:35:26.954
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their lobbyists works for the heads of </v>

759
00:35:28.341 --> 00:35:31.010
<v Speaker 3>the Department of the interior and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

760
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:33.770
<v Speaker 3>it's over like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're reaching.</v>

761
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.800
<v Speaker 3>This is an end stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

762
00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:37.290
<v Speaker 3>hold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you mean.</v>

763
00:35:37.291 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 3>And like God</v>

764
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.320
<v Speaker 1>knows like depending on how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how high I am,</v>

765
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.780
<v Speaker 1>my brain will get really shrill about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

766
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:44.030
<v Speaker 1>this is it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the end stage.</v>

767
00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:47.430
<v Speaker 1>This fucking apocalypse happened man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

768
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:51.150
<v Speaker 1>but then then when you go and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I make some ketamine.</v>

769
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:51.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

770
00:35:51.871 --> 00:35:52.704
<v Speaker 1>like I had on my podcast recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's said his story and the first </v>

771
00:35:55.621 --> 00:35:57.510
<v Speaker 1>question I asked him is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this the end of the world?</v>

772
00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.520
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

773
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:00.770
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

774
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.793
<v Speaker 1>they go into black plague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wiped out like what 30 percent of the </v>

775
00:36:05.071 --> 00:36:05.904
<v Speaker 1>people on Earth got white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly Times that are filled with </v>

776
00:36:09.391 --> 00:36:12.660
<v Speaker 1>adversity and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a restructuring.</v>

777
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

778
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean it's the end of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>per se,</v>

779
00:36:15.601 --> 00:36:16.434
<v Speaker 1>but it's the end of the American empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the end of America as a country </v>

780
00:36:21.991 --> 00:36:22.850
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

781
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:23.743
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people around the world looked up </v>

782
00:36:24.871 --> 00:36:27.120
<v Speaker 1>to as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a model to be emulated.</v>

783
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:28.103
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a contest to see who controls </v>

784
00:36:29.671 --> 00:36:30.504
<v Speaker 1>the nukes and this is the first time </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the popular guy fucked up what it </v>

785
00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:36.210
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the first time a popular guy</v>

786
00:36:36.211 --> 00:36:37.044
<v Speaker 1>entered the popularity contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who knows how to be popular and </v>

787
00:36:40.171 --> 00:36:41.004
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of people out there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are pro wrestling fans and they bought </v>

788
00:36:42.971 --> 00:36:44.220
<v Speaker 1>right in Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>line and sinker.</v>

789
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.233
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very simplistic version of </v>

790
00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:48.624
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of other people that </v>

791
00:36:48.781 --> 00:36:49.614
<v Speaker 1>wanted to throw a monkey wrench in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system because they thought Hillary </v>

792
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Clinton was a crook and she probably is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're all crooks.</v>

793
00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:57.180
<v Speaker 1>There's most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of those people at the top,</v>

794
00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:00.000
<v Speaker 1>or at least in some way fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

795
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.730
<v Speaker 1>We have an opportunity to rebound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Al Franken,</v>

796
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:08.670
<v Speaker 1>and I know Al Franken's just a but </v>
<v Speaker 1>grabber and all things considered.</v>

797
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:10.403
<v Speaker 1>Did you read the last bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the straw that broke the camel's </v>

798
00:37:12.271 --> 00:37:12.550
<v Speaker 1>back?</v>

799
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.970
<v Speaker 1>The last one where the veil said enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>is enough.</v>

800
00:37:14.971 --> 00:37:17.510
<v Speaker 1>It was in the Atlantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This woman or he put that.</v>

801
00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.340
<v Speaker 1>She asked for a photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put his arm around.</v>

802
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:23.010
<v Speaker 1>His hand was on her waist and schools </v>
<v Speaker 1>are fat.</v>

803
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:23.900
<v Speaker 1>He squeezed her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

804
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:27.870
<v Speaker 1>She said he grabbed a handful of flesh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a weird thing to say,</v>

805
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.620
<v Speaker 1>but he squeezed her at least twice is </v>
<v Speaker 1>her quote.</v>

806
00:37:31.621 --> 00:37:32.454
<v Speaker 1>At least twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had his hand on her waist and she </v>

807
00:37:35.971 --> 00:37:36.804
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even let my husband touch me </v>

808
00:37:37.591 --> 00:37:40.560
<v Speaker 1>that way in public because it demeans me</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a professional woman.</v>

809
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking kidding me.</v>

810
00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.213
<v Speaker 1>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to interview her husband like </v>

811
00:37:45.181 --> 00:37:48.040
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to put your arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>around your wife in public.</v>

812
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:51.510
<v Speaker 1>The squeezer my wife would love to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>squeezed.</v>

813
00:37:51.511 --> 00:37:53.100
<v Speaker 1>The more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more the merrier.</v>

814
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.730
<v Speaker 1>The idea of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

815
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.673
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange because that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one doesn't make sense to Leanne </v>

816
00:37:58.071 --> 00:37:59.670
<v Speaker 1>tweet and one was the only one that made</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

817
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.100
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a photo of me.</v>

818
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.030
<v Speaker 1>She's unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's demeaning,</v>

819
00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:05.850
<v Speaker 1>I get the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He apologized for that and rightly so.</v>

820
00:38:05.851 --> 00:38:09.510
<v Speaker 1>And apparently he tried to kiss her but </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the butt grab and it's like,</v>

821
00:38:09.511 --> 00:38:10.344
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely shouldn't be grabbing </v>

822
00:38:11.311 --> 00:38:12.600
<v Speaker 1>people's Butts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

823
00:38:12.601 --> 00:38:17.520
<v Speaker 1>how much of a big deal is it also do </v>
<v Speaker 1>have we stopped?</v>

824
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.533
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chelsea handler was on Bill Maher the </v>

825
00:38:19.441 --> 00:38:20.274
<v Speaker 1>other night and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to believe these women because </v>

826
00:38:22.411 --> 00:38:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

827
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

828
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.660
<v Speaker 1>does that mean I have to believe all </v>
<v Speaker 1>men?</v>

829
00:38:27.661 --> 00:38:28.494
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm a man the isn't there any </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion about whether these things </v>

830
00:38:32.941 --> 00:38:35.040
<v Speaker 1>are true or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Mia said this,</v>

831
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 1>he said</v>

832
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:36.903
<v Speaker 6>he put it on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes saying all women are liars is </v>

833
00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 6>just as crazy as saying all women tell </v>
<v Speaker 6>the truth.</v>

834
00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.090
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

835
00:38:44.091 --> 00:38:45.580
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot.</v>

836
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.750
<v Speaker 3>Franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about Franklin,</v>

837
00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.140
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

838
00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:53.630
<v Speaker 3>like Weinstein wasn't like 40 people or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

839
00:38:53.631 --> 00:38:57.870
<v Speaker 3>like 40.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when it starts getting up in the</v>

840
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.490
<v Speaker 3>and also what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's accused of it.</v>

841
00:38:59.491 --> 00:38:59.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

842
00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:00.703
<v Speaker 6>In different things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're not talking about taking pictures </v>

843
00:39:02.231 --> 00:39:03.010
<v Speaker 6>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were,</v>

844
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:03.843
<v Speaker 6>they like you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They want to take a picture of you and </v>

845
00:39:04.661 --> 00:39:06.430
<v Speaker 6>you grabbed their waste.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're talking about.</v>

846
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.520
<v Speaker 6>I mean he's been accused of rape by more</v>
<v Speaker 6>than one woman,</v>

847
00:39:09.521 --> 00:39:10.780
<v Speaker 6>like actual rape,</v>
<v Speaker 6>rape.</v>

848
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:14.440
<v Speaker 6>Not just like getting someone drunk and </v>
<v Speaker 6>having sex with them and be like holding</v>

849
00:39:14.441 --> 00:39:17.150
<v Speaker 6>them down type rape.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a lot of,</v>

850
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.360
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of crazy.</v>

851
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.450
<v Speaker 6>See here's what's kind of fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

852
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:27.960
<v Speaker 6>if prostitution was legal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>would that exist or is it a power thing?</v>

853
00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.293
<v Speaker 6>Is it always a power thing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like does he want to have sex with the </v>

854
00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:36.190
<v Speaker 6>star of his films?</v>

855
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:39.170
<v Speaker 3>Because that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more a question of if,</v>

856
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:44.470
<v Speaker 3>if there weren't so many teenage boys </v>
<v Speaker 3>who never got laid what with the society</v>

857
00:39:46.251 --> 00:39:47.084
<v Speaker 3>look like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by this I don't mean to excuse </v>

858
00:39:48.471 --> 00:39:49.304
<v Speaker 3>anyone and I don't mean to say teenage </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls should be more promiscuous or </v>

859
00:39:52.551 --> 00:39:54.050
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just looking at objects.</v>

860
00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying that guys like Harvey </v>
<v Speaker 3>Weinstein,</v>

861
00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:58.460
<v Speaker 3>that Dude didn't get laid in high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

862
00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:01.040
<v Speaker 3>Most of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at these mass shootings,</v>

863
00:40:01.041 --> 00:40:04.550
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these guys in their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their suicide notes say,</v>

864
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing this because I can't get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to die a virgin.</v>

865
00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:10.100
<v Speaker 3>That's the one begins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

866
00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:11.403
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this a massive amount of </v>

867
00:40:13.071 --> 00:40:13.904
<v Speaker 3>frustration that builds up because </v>
<v Speaker 3>biologically most boys are horny little </v>

868
00:40:18.351 --> 00:40:22.010
<v Speaker 3>monsters at 13 or 14.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not getting laid.</v>

869
00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.340
<v Speaker 3>And so it gets to the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there may be five,</v>

870
00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:32.360
<v Speaker 3>six years between when a boy is totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with not just sex,</v>

871
00:40:33.981 --> 00:40:38.180
<v Speaker 3>but with being acceptable to women being</v>
<v Speaker 3>loved by women being touched,</v>

872
00:40:38.181 --> 00:40:42.920
<v Speaker 3>being caressed being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they can't think about anything else</v>

873
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:43.843
<v Speaker 3>and they're not getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think a lot of boys grow up </v>

874
00:40:47.481 --> 00:40:51.350
<v Speaker 3>with extreme frustration that either </v>
<v Speaker 3>curdles into misogyny,</v>

875
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:53.430
<v Speaker 3>where you get these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like mass killers who,</v>

876
00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.790
<v Speaker 3>who did they kill hookers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

877
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.150
<v Speaker 3>Sexually Liberated Free Women in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

878
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.840
<v Speaker 3>And you get guys that just chase money </v>
<v Speaker 3>their whole lives because they think the</v>

879
00:41:02.841 --> 00:41:05.120
<v Speaker 3>money and the power is going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

880
00:41:05.121 --> 00:41:05.954
<v Speaker 3>those women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when they get to that place and </v>

881
00:41:07.641 --> 00:41:10.400
<v Speaker 3>they're still fucking disgusting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

882
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.970
<v Speaker 3>they sense that the women don't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to fuck them or they only fuck them</v>

883
00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.680
<v Speaker 3>because they're going to get something </v>
<v Speaker 3>from them.</v>

884
00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.740
<v Speaker 3>Then there's all this self hatred and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shame.</v>

885
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.930
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what's being expressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

886
00:41:20.931 --> 00:41:23.710
<v Speaker 3>So I think it is power and I do think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it has a,</v>

887
00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:26.670
<v Speaker 3>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an expression or a manifestation of</v>

888
00:41:26.671 --> 00:41:29.720
<v Speaker 3>a deeply sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative pathological culture.</v>

889
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.823
<v Speaker 6>Conversely,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do you feel about like women that </v>

890
00:41:32.001 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 6>weren't attractive in high,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how come they don't lash</v>

891
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:34.963
<v Speaker 1>out at the same way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not out there rape and did one </v>

892
00:41:37.401 --> 00:41:42.040
<v Speaker 1>becoming them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women are much better at accepting their</v>

893
00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:42.913
<v Speaker 1>sexual situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see women have accepted a lot of </v>

894
00:41:45.141 --> 00:41:48.350
<v Speaker 1>shit that men are unable to accept for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Millennia.</v>

895
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.070
<v Speaker 1>That's partly biological and probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly cultural,</v>

896
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:56.780
<v Speaker 1>but also because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean women can have sex.</v>

897
00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Even women who aren't particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive because the,</v>

898
00:42:00.141 --> 00:42:00.974
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole market is so skewed in the </v>

899
00:42:03.501 --> 00:42:04.334
<v Speaker 1>other direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even women who aren't particularly </v>

900
00:42:07.161 --> 00:42:10.550
<v Speaker 1>attractive probably don't have much </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble getting laid in high school.</v>

901
00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.813
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're boiling it down to </v>

902
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.820
<v Speaker 1>getting laid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a reductionist thing.</v>

903
00:42:16.821 --> 00:42:21.821
<v Speaker 1>I think it's way more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an unattractive woman who has a hard</v>

904
00:42:22.641 --> 00:42:24.140
<v Speaker 1>time finding a boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

905
00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:25.083
<v Speaker 1>someone who loves her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who wants to be emotionally </v>

906
00:42:26.511 --> 00:42:27.344
<v Speaker 1>connected to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That probably is just as children full </v>

907
00:42:29.901 --> 00:42:32.870
<v Speaker 1>to a woman as a guy who can't find maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>more painful.</v>

908
00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then a guy who can't find sex partner in</v>

909
00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.760
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that men express their,</v>

910
00:42:37.761 --> 00:42:42.620
<v Speaker 1>their these feelings through anger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women through depression and sadness.</v>

911
00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.493
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you probably don't see women lashing </v>

912
00:42:44.871 --> 00:42:48.170
<v Speaker 1>out and killing a bunch of dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see them being depressed and feeling</v>

913
00:42:48.171 --> 00:42:49.130
<v Speaker 1>like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you do,</v>

914
00:42:49.131 --> 00:42:50.750
<v Speaker 1>they have high testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why</v>

915
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:55.170
<v Speaker 2>another point to be made here is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that like,</v>

916
00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:56.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do say the thing,</v>

917
00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:59.250
<v Speaker 2>oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people like Harvey Weinstein,</v>

918
00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.980
<v Speaker 2>they wanted all this money to get laid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>

919
00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:04.913
<v Speaker 2>I do not think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what people like Harvey </v>

920
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Weinstein probably enjoy his power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

921
00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.270
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get fucking laid.</v>

922
00:43:12.271 --> 00:43:15.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to become this massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I like to dominate.</v>

923
00:43:15.331 --> 00:43:18.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm a dominating force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I am.</v>

924
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:22.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy like having people around me who</v>

925
00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.800
<v Speaker 2>worship me and as part of that I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to dominate my interns.</v>

926
00:43:28.261 --> 00:43:31.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to dominate my employees and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm around women,</v>

927
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:32.303
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to use my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fucking jerk off and house </v>

928
00:43:34.751 --> 00:43:36.750
<v Speaker 2>plants in front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

929
00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:39.230
<v Speaker 2>it's like really fucking the ficus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

930
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:41.340
<v Speaker 2>you gotta you gotTa really think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

931
00:43:41.341 --> 00:43:42.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

932
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:43.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>

933
00:43:43.651 --> 00:43:45.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor Harvey Weinstein.</v>

934
00:43:45.031 --> 00:43:47.390
<v Speaker 2>When he was fucking in front of the God </v>
<v Speaker 2>damned with the.</v>

935
00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.450
<v Speaker 2>He's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

936
00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.960
<v Speaker 2>the thing of like he's not getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>touched enough.</v>

937
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

938
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:51.891
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

939
00:43:51.891 --> 00:43:52.724
<v Speaker 1>but it's like this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of frustration that's </v>

940
00:43:55.491 --> 00:43:56.324
<v Speaker 1>inherently connected to this suppressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual culture that we find ourselves </v>

941
00:44:00.051 --> 00:44:05.000
<v Speaker 1>embroiled in that we don't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree with these fucking little boys.</v>

942
00:44:05.001 --> 00:44:05.811
<v Speaker 1>Why are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

943
00:44:05.811 --> 00:44:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Because one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only access they have to.</v>

944
00:44:08.211 --> 00:44:10.130
<v Speaker 1>They're less likely to tell on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And three,</v>

945
00:44:10.131 --> 00:44:13.670
<v Speaker 1>there's self hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just recidivism.</v>

946
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:15.440
<v Speaker 2>I like to do a little thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment,</v>

947
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:16.573
<v Speaker 2>which is I like to imagine what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where my head's gotta be if I jerk off </v>

948
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.120
<v Speaker 2>into a house plant in front of somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't,</v>

949
00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.210
<v Speaker 2>if you have tried that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just just think about it.</v>

950
00:44:26.211 --> 00:44:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Like where would you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with you Christmas tree?</v>

951
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:30.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be like you're just </v>

952
00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:31.983
<v Speaker 1>celebrating.</v>

953
00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:41.100
<v Speaker 8>He doesn't mind if you jerk off in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>plant,</v>

954
00:44:41.101 --> 00:44:43.930
<v Speaker 8>the plants can absorb it and he's just </v>
<v Speaker 8>leaving as dna all over the place.</v>

955
00:44:43.931 --> 00:44:45.810
<v Speaker 8>It's really good for the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Bet It is.</v>

956
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:47.560
<v Speaker 8>It's terrible for plants.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Not My.</v>

957
00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:51.120
<v Speaker 8>Jim Weinstein is great for parents,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Bro.</v>

958
00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:55.323
<v Speaker 8>Plants alive.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's running for Senate Alpha Alphacam </v>

959
00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:02.660
<v Speaker 8>coming soon from onnit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Joko you can really sell your com right?</v>

960
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:09.210
<v Speaker 8>I don't want anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 8>don't you think that all these things,</v>

961
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:09.960
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

962
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:14.960
<v Speaker 8>I think it's certainly this sex is not </v>
<v Speaker 8>just a power thing because he's not just</v>

963
00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:18.990
<v Speaker 8>exercising power.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's exercising power in a sexual way.</v>

964
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.400
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not just power.</v>

965
00:45:20.401 --> 00:45:21.234
<v Speaker 8>I think it's the game,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like we were talking about like </v>

966
00:45:22.621 --> 00:45:26.640
<v Speaker 8>corporations and even police officers </v>
<v Speaker 8>and guys like Jeff sessions who have the</v>

967
00:45:26.641 --> 00:45:29.550
<v Speaker 8>game to arrest people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That is the game they play.</v>

968
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:30.503
<v Speaker 8>They get really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what the game is the game with a </v>

969
00:45:33.151 --> 00:45:36.570
<v Speaker 8>guy like him is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can't believe I get to fuck what's her</v>

970
00:45:36.571 --> 00:45:37.470
<v Speaker 8>name,</v>
<v Speaker 8>know name,</v>

971
00:45:37.471 --> 00:45:42.471
<v Speaker 8>famous actress and that famous actress </v>
<v Speaker 8>is on her stomach and your mouth fucking</v>

972
00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:43.080
<v Speaker 8>her.</v>

973
00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:43.913
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Whoa,</v>

974
00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.780
<v Speaker 8>really?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is this really happening?</v>

975
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:46.673
<v Speaker 8>And it wasn't really happening.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's happening because you're going to </v>

976
00:45:47.881 --> 00:45:49.830
<v Speaker 8>let her be cat woman or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 8>fuck the movie is.</v>

977
00:45:49.831 --> 00:45:50.664
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

978
00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:54.240
<v Speaker 8>There's some nuttiness to it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There was some craziness.</v>

979
00:45:54.241 --> 00:45:56.520
<v Speaker 8>There's some forbidden thing to it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's some,</v>

980
00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:59.430
<v Speaker 8>there's a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a bunch of things in play powers.</v>

981
00:45:59.431 --> 00:46:02.570
<v Speaker 8>One of the dynamics,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just the most foul one because they</v>

982
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:03.413
<v Speaker 8>all the other ones like the sexual </v>
<v Speaker 8>frustration and stuff doesn't seem so </v>

983
00:46:05.941 --> 00:46:07.530
<v Speaker 8>gross.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like when you,</v>

984
00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:08.271
<v Speaker 8>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're,</v>

985
00:46:08.271 --> 00:46:11.410
<v Speaker 8>you're imposing your will on someone.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then it's unquestionably an,</v>

986
00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.940
<v Speaker 8>an expression of power.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like once you were raping,</v>

987
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:15.953
<v Speaker 8>once you're coercing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>once you're imposing your will and </v>

988
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.640
<v Speaker 8>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to take away your career.</v>

989
00:46:20.641 --> 00:46:23.220
<v Speaker 8>If you don't let me have sexual </v>
<v Speaker 8>intercourse with you,</v>

990
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:26.790
<v Speaker 8>well then it's 100 percent power thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like how did it get there?</v>

991
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:31.200
<v Speaker 8>There's a lot of things and I think </v>
<v Speaker 8>you've got to get a lot of power.</v>

992
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:32.001
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

993
00:46:32.001 --> 00:46:32.834
<v Speaker 8>I guess I haven't exercised sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 8>power in my life to know the answer to </v>

994
00:46:36.031 --> 00:46:37.050
<v Speaker 8>this question,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but does,</v>

995
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:41.520
<v Speaker 8>does dominance feel good directly or is </v>
<v Speaker 8>it,</v>

996
00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.190
<v Speaker 8>is it something that comes to you </v>
<v Speaker 8>indirectly.</v>

997
00:46:44.191 --> 00:46:45.024
<v Speaker 8>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 8>does it feel good to dominate someone </v>

998
00:46:49.291 --> 00:46:52.290
<v Speaker 8>else or only because then you can get </v>
<v Speaker 8>something that you want from them?</v>

999
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:55.380
<v Speaker 8>I think it's something that you want </v>
<v Speaker 8>from them and I think there's also,</v>

1000
00:46:55.530 --> 00:47:00.530
<v Speaker 8>there's I think human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 8>connected to each other in an undeniable</v>

1001
00:47:00.931 --> 00:47:01.764
<v Speaker 8>way and I think that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 8>exercising power over someone like say </v>

1002
00:47:04.921 --> 00:47:09.060
<v Speaker 8>if you hate to paint the scenario but </v>
<v Speaker 8>just save you rape someone,</v>

1003
00:47:09.061 --> 00:47:11.460
<v Speaker 8>you were sexually attracted to someone </v>
<v Speaker 8>you're loan with you and you raped them,</v>

1004
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:14.670
<v Speaker 8>and if you have any conscience at all,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you,</v>

1005
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:15.930
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're screaming no,</v>

1006
00:47:15.931 --> 00:47:16.764
<v Speaker 8>and you're still having sex with them </v>
<v Speaker 8>and you come and then after what you </v>

1007
00:47:18.541 --> 00:47:22.680
<v Speaker 8>have to think about it like you would be</v>
<v Speaker 8>horrified at yourself.</v>

1008
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.870
<v Speaker 8>The level of self hatred would be almost</v>
<v Speaker 8>unimaginable.</v>

1009
00:47:26.871 --> 00:47:29.380
<v Speaker 8>Even posed yourself and your,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're,</v>

1010
00:47:29.381 --> 00:47:31.060
<v Speaker 8>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're twisted sickness.</v>

1011
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 8>At the heart of that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1012
00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:36.090
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

1013
00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:36.500
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

1014
00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.190
<v Speaker 8>the power dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Trying to impose the power.</v>

1015
00:47:39.191 --> 00:47:42.400
<v Speaker 8>It can't possibly feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it's just a thing.</v>

1016
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.073
<v Speaker 8>I think it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>almost like a creepy leftover reptilian </v>

1017
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:52.060
<v Speaker 8>instinct that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that creatures have.</v>

1018
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:56.500
<v Speaker 8>Because if you look at rape in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and this is not to exonerate,</v>

1019
00:47:56.501 --> 00:47:57.334
<v Speaker 8>rapist is not to normalize rape,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's insanely common in the animal </v>

1020
00:48:01.631 --> 00:48:02.740
<v Speaker 8>kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1021
00:48:02.741 --> 00:48:05.410
<v Speaker 8>It's all.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's common in ducks.</v>

1022
00:48:05.411 --> 00:48:07.600
<v Speaker 8>It's in common in all sorts of different</v>
<v Speaker 8>animals.</v>

1023
00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:09.853
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Orangutans are ruthless and it's tough </v>

1024
00:48:11.411 --> 00:48:12.244
<v Speaker 8>because there are a lot of primatologist</v>
<v Speaker 8>are women and they learned the hard way </v>

1025
00:48:16.421 --> 00:48:18.850
<v Speaker 8>from what I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that the always wear jeans.</v>

1026
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:21.250
<v Speaker 8>If you're working with Orangutans,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh Jesus Christ,</v>

1027
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:22.380
<v Speaker 8>rape a tanks.</v>

1028
00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.580
<v Speaker 8>That's awful,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but this,</v>

1029
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:25.443
<v Speaker 8>that this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're supposed to be evolved past that </v>

1030
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:30.100
<v Speaker 8>and for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 8>by far and above,</v>

1031
00:48:30.101 --> 00:48:30.934
<v Speaker 8>we are right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you think about all these sexual </v>

1032
00:48:33.011 --> 00:48:36.310
<v Speaker 8>harassment interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 8>now imagine if they were chimps,</v>

1033
00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:38.140
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

1034
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:42.040
<v Speaker 8>imagine if they were a Rangataua was the</v>
<v Speaker 8>rape is the common thing.</v>

1035
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:43.053
<v Speaker 8>You could never have a bunch of a tanks </v>
<v Speaker 8>in some sort of a building and people </v>

1036
00:48:46.051 --> 00:48:46.351
<v Speaker 8>would go,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

1037
00:48:46.351 --> 00:48:48.160
<v Speaker 8>of course we're better than a rank </v>
<v Speaker 8>tanks.</v>

1038
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.530
<v Speaker 8>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's why we don't rape as much,</v>

1039
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:51.933
<v Speaker 8>but it is problematic to use the word </v>
<v Speaker 8>rape when you're talking about animals </v>

1040
00:48:54.701 --> 00:48:57.160
<v Speaker 8>because part of it is that the way you </v>
<v Speaker 8>described it,</v>

1041
00:48:57.161 --> 00:48:57.994
<v Speaker 8>that knowledge on some level that this </v>
<v Speaker 8>female is totally not into what's </v>

1042
00:49:02.411 --> 00:49:05.160
<v Speaker 8>happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Whereas presumably Iranian,</v>

1043
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.023
<v Speaker 8>Tim doesn't have that knowledge and also</v>
<v Speaker 8>there are animals where the female is </v>

1044
00:49:10.211 --> 00:49:15.211
<v Speaker 8>triggered to ovulate by aggressive male </v>
<v Speaker 8>behavior that we might call raping.</v>

1045
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:16.750
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like rabbits.</v>

1046
00:49:16.751 --> 00:49:19.540
<v Speaker 8>You bite the back of their neck and </v>
<v Speaker 8>that's what makes the female ovulate.</v>

1047
00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.320
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's.</v>

1048
00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.470
<v Speaker 8>There's a lot of weird stuff when it </v>
<v Speaker 8>comes to women's w,</v>

1049
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:24.343
<v Speaker 8>what,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what is sexually attractive to certain </v>

1050
00:49:26.981 --> 00:49:30.520
<v Speaker 8>women and what arouses them?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Rape fantasies is the number one.</v>

1051
00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:33.130
<v Speaker 8>A lot of women like to be choked,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1052
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:34.420
<v Speaker 8>like what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're like,</v>

1053
00:49:34.421 --> 00:49:35.620
<v Speaker 8>why?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why do you like to be choked?</v>

1054
00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:36.483
<v Speaker 8>Why do you like to get your arms pinned </v>
<v Speaker 8>behind your back and why do you like to </v>

1055
00:49:39.191 --> 00:49:41.380
<v Speaker 8>fight back?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like you actually like it.</v>

1056
00:49:41.381 --> 00:49:44.080
<v Speaker 8>You want me to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You want me to hold both your wrists?</v>

1057
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.160
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're sure,</v>

1058
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:47.860
<v Speaker 8>like there's a lot of tying up going on </v>
<v Speaker 8>out there.</v>

1059
00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:49.030
<v Speaker 8>There's really.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1060
00:49:49.031 --> 00:49:49.864
<v Speaker 8>there's a lot of people are.</v>

1061
00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:51.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is all very strange stuff in </v>

1062
00:49:56.861 --> 00:49:58.450
<v Speaker 2>your apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing.</v>

1063
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:02.190
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to like s and M or bondage</v>
<v Speaker 2>at one,</v>

1064
00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:03.123
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the big misconceptions </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to that is that if you're </v>

1065
00:50:06.731 --> 00:50:09.610
<v Speaker 2>being tied up or if you're tying </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody up there,</v>

1066
00:50:09.611 --> 00:50:12.850
<v Speaker 2>there's like anger happening in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

1067
00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:16.330
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loving,</v>

1068
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:19.090
<v Speaker 2>trusting things that you can do for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the.</v>

1069
00:50:19.091 --> 00:50:19.924
<v Speaker 2>It's really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say full easily sell it </v>

1070
00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:22.313
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1071
00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:25.120
<v Speaker 2>I've spent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot of time in dungeons.</v>

1072
00:50:25.121 --> 00:50:25.954
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

1073
00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.620
<v Speaker 9>It's a healing sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 9>beautiful thing.</v>

1074
00:50:32.621 --> 00:50:37.520
<v Speaker 9>There's a difference between that and </v>
<v Speaker 9>rough sex is very rich.</v>

1075
00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.540
<v Speaker 9>I mean I personally find it not,</v>
<v Speaker 9>not.</v>

1076
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:45.200
<v Speaker 9>It doesn't turn me on at all largely </v>
<v Speaker 9>because it's so choreographed.</v>

1077
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:47.203
<v Speaker 9>All the outfits and the this and now </v>
<v Speaker 9>we're going to do that and safe words </v>

1078
00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:52.163
<v Speaker 9>and.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

1079
00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:55.940
<v Speaker 9>but I mean I have been in those </v>
<v Speaker 9>environments and as Duncan says,</v>

1080
00:50:55.941 --> 00:50:56.774
<v Speaker 9>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's like the opposite of out of </v>

1081
00:50:58.131 --> 00:51:00.590
<v Speaker 9>control.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's totally in control.</v>

1082
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.490
<v Speaker 9>Totally worked out the difference </v>
<v Speaker 9>between a gun range and a war.</v>

1083
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:14.600
<v Speaker 9>So funny.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well the last time I was at a gun range,</v>

1084
00:51:14.601 --> 00:51:17.300
<v Speaker 9>I ended up bleeding from the head.</v>
<v Speaker 9>What happened?</v>

1085
00:51:17.301 --> 00:51:20.030
<v Speaker 9>I was with my buddy justin and we were </v>
<v Speaker 9>shooting,</v>

1086
00:51:20.031 --> 00:51:22.920
<v Speaker 9>this is up in Washington state where I </v>
<v Speaker 9>was shooting his uh,</v>

1087
00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:28.190
<v Speaker 9>remember what a 30,</v>
<v Speaker 9>30 or something and sculpt he had.</v>

1088
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:31.640
<v Speaker 9>He had this big elk gun that he was </v>
<v Speaker 9>trying to scope in and he was like,</v>

1089
00:51:31.641 --> 00:51:32.510
<v Speaker 9>man,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not like,</v>

1090
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:33.523
<v Speaker 9>you're shooting really well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>can you just take a shot at a few shots </v>

1091
00:51:35.301 --> 00:51:36.260
<v Speaker 9>on this and see if you.</v>

1092
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:41.270
<v Speaker 9>And I just grabbed it and didn't think </v>
<v Speaker 9>that it was a totally different gun.</v>

1093
00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:43.610
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I just went boom in the scope,</v>

1094
00:51:43.611 --> 00:51:47.480
<v Speaker 9>went right into my forehead.</v>
<v Speaker 9>All these macho dudes,</v>

1095
00:51:47.481 --> 00:51:47.860
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm,</v>

1096
00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:52.860
<v Speaker 9>I'm exposed as the idiot range.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We went to shoot at burnt down.</v>

1097
00:51:53.091 --> 00:51:54.410
<v Speaker 9>Did you hear about that?</v>
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>

1098
00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.090
<v Speaker 9>I would imagine it did.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I would imagine it now.</v>

1099
00:51:57.310 --> 00:51:58.160
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>recently,</v>

1100
00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:01.670
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's definitely fires in that area.</v>

1101
00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:02.533
<v Speaker 9>I mean the fires are so out of control,</v>
<v Speaker 9>especially that out towards Santa </v>

1102
00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:07.920
<v Speaker 9>Barbara and Ventura,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Ventura,</v>

1103
00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:10.220
<v Speaker 9>and that's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know what I keep thinking?</v>

1104
00:52:10.221 --> 00:52:11.054
<v Speaker 9>What if the fucking big one hits like </v>
<v Speaker 9>shit's gonna catch on fire on the big </v>

1105
00:52:14.091 --> 00:52:17.000
<v Speaker 9>one heads and all the roads are going to</v>
<v Speaker 9>be fucked up.</v>

1106
00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.310
<v Speaker 9>The infrastructure is going to be messed</v>
<v Speaker 9>up.</v>

1107
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:23.510
<v Speaker 9>That like this is like without a massive</v>
<v Speaker 9>earthquake.</v>

1108
00:52:23.511 --> 00:52:28.511
<v Speaker 9>What happens if the big one hit right </v>
<v Speaker 9>now all the water lines are broken.</v>

1109
00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:32.330
<v Speaker 9>Trucks can't get there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

1110
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:33.860
<v Speaker 9>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It could be a giant issue.</v>

1111
00:52:33.861 --> 00:52:36.350
<v Speaker 9>Then you have toxic clouds and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 9>too,</v>

1112
00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:38.540
<v Speaker 9>because all these warehouses going.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Not only that,</v>

1113
00:52:38.541 --> 00:52:40.550
<v Speaker 9>if the big one hits,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's entirely likely.</v>

1114
00:52:40.551 --> 00:52:43.040
<v Speaker 9>It's not just going to hit here,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it also hits in the ocean.</v>

1115
00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:48.140
<v Speaker 9>Which case we get hit with a tsunami.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Which case all that super expensive real</v>

1116
00:52:48.141 --> 00:52:52.880
<v Speaker 9>estate in Malibu just gets wiped away.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm good up in Topanga though.</v>

1117
00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:54.630
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're probably,</v>

1118
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.160
<v Speaker 9>if you're not good up in Topanga.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We're really.</v>

1119
00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:00.170

<v Speaker 9>You're like a canary in a coal mine.</v>

1121

<v Speaker 9>Calculate the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 9>leave it to me,</v>

1122
00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:08.003
<v Speaker 9>dude.</v>

1123
00:53:09.741 --> 00:53:12.200
<v Speaker 9>about.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's the,</v>

1124

<v Speaker 9>Shit's changing.</v>

1126
00:53:19.161 --> 00:53:19.994
<v Speaker 9>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you ever watched like porky's or if </v>

1127
00:53:21.681 --> 00:53:23.600
<v Speaker 9>you watch any of the movies from the </v>
<v Speaker 9>seventies,</v>

1132
00:53:34.171 --> 00:53:35.070
<v Speaker 2>just considered like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1141
00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:57.750

<v Speaker 2>what's happening is moves from the </v>

1143
00:54:00.601 --> 00:54:01.434
<v Speaker 2>fifties where the guy will just grab the</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman and things are changing is what's </v>

1144
00:54:07.531 --> 00:54:08.031
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1147
00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:13.500
<v Speaker 2>like the two things we need to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:15.600
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>

1150
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:17.543
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1151
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:18.443
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hanging out with you doing the </v>

1152
00:54:20.491 --> 00:54:22.820
<v Speaker 2>podcast with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1153
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:23.693
<v Speaker 2>Here's one thing I know man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure at least you don't want </v>

1154
00:54:27.661 --> 00:54:28.494
<v Speaker 2>to fuck me.</v>

1155
00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:32.283
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell he didn't look at me when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said it was just totally left out for </v>

1156
00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.840
<v Speaker 2>the chapter and your next book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1157
00:54:39.841 --> 00:54:41.460
<v Speaker 2>Research Duncan with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1158
00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:45.030
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with what's happening with women is a.</v>

1159
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:48.240
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of dudes and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry if this is a shocking thing to</v>

1160
00:54:48.241 --> 00:54:50.700
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of dudes are in positions of power</v>

1161
00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:54.510
<v Speaker 2>and what's happening with women is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>who want to be actors.</v>

1162
00:54:54.511 --> 00:54:56.220
<v Speaker 2>You're wanting whatever you want to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>

1163
00:54:56.221 --> 00:54:58.710
<v Speaker 2>do stuff when they're getting around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys,</v>

1164
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.520
<v Speaker 2>they don't have that assurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not like,</v>

1165
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:06.120
<v Speaker 2>this guy doesn't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably thinking this guy wants</v>

1166
00:55:06.121 --> 00:55:09.240
<v Speaker 2>to fuck me for these are women who most </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys want to fuck.</v>

1167
00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So especially</v>

1168
00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:12.290
<v Speaker 6>if you're talking about Harvey </v>
<v Speaker 6>Weinstein,</v>

1169
00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:14.040
<v Speaker 6>these hot actresses,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1170
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.120
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the real.</v>

1171
00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:18.100
<v Speaker 6>The strange thing is you have that </v>
<v Speaker 6>unquestionably.</v>

1172
00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:18.993
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you have women that want to </v>

1173
00:55:21.281 --> 00:55:24.550
<v Speaker 6>have nothing to do with that part of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>business.</v>

1174
00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.280
<v Speaker 6>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not trying to be seductive,</v>

1175
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:29.590
<v Speaker 6>they just want to work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They want to act,</v>

1176
00:55:29.591 --> 00:55:31.180
<v Speaker 6>and then they have to deal with all this</v>
<v Speaker 6>bullshit.</v>

1177
00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:33.700
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then you've got women who sneak into</v>

1178
00:55:33.701 --> 00:55:37.300
<v Speaker 6>that mix and they're willing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not only they willing,</v>

1179
00:55:37.301 --> 00:55:40.940
<v Speaker 6>they're manipulative and they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>seductive and they.</v>

1180
00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:42.520
<v Speaker 6>They're trying to make their way up the </v>
<v Speaker 6>ladder.</v>

1181
00:55:42.521 --> 00:55:45.340
<v Speaker 6>That way they exist there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a much smaller percentage,</v>

1182
00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:46.323
<v Speaker 6>but they exist to make sure that their </v>
<v Speaker 6>whole society is set up to make women </v>

1183
00:55:49.991 --> 00:55:53.440
<v Speaker 6>think that the only thing they have to </v>
<v Speaker 6>trade is their sexuality.</v>

1184
00:55:53.441 --> 00:55:54.274
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 6>with these women agreeing to do a film </v>

1185
00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:00.220
<v Speaker 6>with not even Harvey Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anyone.</v>

1186
00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:01.173
<v Speaker 6>And then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll give you more parts if you fucked </v>

1187
00:56:03.521 --> 00:56:04.900
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the girl wants to do it.</v>

1188
00:56:04.901 --> 00:56:05.734
<v Speaker 6>And she does it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1189
00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:09.250
<v Speaker 6>I think it's gross,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not gross.</v>

1190
00:56:09.251 --> 00:56:11.200
<v Speaker 6>It's not gross to her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>

1191
00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:13.180
<v Speaker 6>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a weird thing.</v>

1192
00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:14.193
<v Speaker 6>It's only grows if it's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's gross being around a guy like </v>

1193
00:56:18.191 --> 00:56:19.240
<v Speaker 6>Harvey Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1194
00:56:19.241 --> 00:56:22.510
<v Speaker 6>If he's yelling at people and he's fat </v>
<v Speaker 6>and sweating all over the place,</v>

1195
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:23.620
<v Speaker 6>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1196
00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 6>Unless</v>

1197
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.860
<v Speaker 8>it's not gross.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Unless you like that kind of guy.</v>

1198
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:28.540
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like you might bears.</v>

1199
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:29.890
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Because they're into bears.</v>

1200
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:32.170
<v Speaker 8>Might you might like that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1201
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.030
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So at what point are we.</v>

1202
00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:37.420
<v Speaker 8>Are we taking away women's agency when </v>
<v Speaker 8>we say that?</v>

1203
00:56:37.421 --> 00:56:38.254
<v Speaker 8>That should never be.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You shouldn't be able to give a guy a </v>

1204
00:56:39.971 --> 00:56:42.160
<v Speaker 8>blow job and get a part in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's weird.</v>

1205
00:56:42.161 --> 00:56:42.994
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like you should be able to pay for </v>

1206
00:56:44.861 --> 00:56:45.694
<v Speaker 8>things,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you shouldn't be able to pay for </v>

1207
00:56:47.051 --> 00:56:49.990
<v Speaker 8>things with sex.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why not?</v>

1208
00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:51.363
<v Speaker 8>That's George Carlin's things.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can buy things when you can have </v>

1209
00:56:53.681 --> 00:56:55.000
<v Speaker 8>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you can't buy sex.</v>

1210
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:56.063
<v Speaker 8>Like it's strange.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's strange because I don't think it's </v>

1211
00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:04.540
<v Speaker 8>necessarily illegal in a barter sense.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like say it to you dinner,</v>

1212
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:09.990
<v Speaker 8>like say if you had some woman and she </v>
<v Speaker 8>wanted to paint your house,</v>

1213
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:16.420
<v Speaker 8>but in it is a bad example or you wanted</v>
<v Speaker 8>to paint her house,</v>

1214
00:57:16.421 --> 00:57:17.620
<v Speaker 8>how about this?</v>
<v Speaker 8>She wants you to pay it,</v>

1215
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:21.340
<v Speaker 8>they're going to pay you but I will suck</v>
<v Speaker 8>your Dick and you're like,</v>

1216
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.280
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's a deal.</v>

1217
00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:26.260
<v Speaker 8>Like that seems like a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like you want to do that?</v>

1218
00:57:26.261 --> 00:57:26.771
<v Speaker 8>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

1219
00:57:26.771 --> 00:57:27.604
<v Speaker 8>I want to do I want to talk to your dad </v>
<v Speaker 8>because I also want you to paint my </v>

1220
00:57:29.111 --> 00:57:31.270
<v Speaker 8>house.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean look at some girl.</v>

1221
00:57:31.271 --> 00:57:32.104
<v Speaker 8>It depends on who it is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's Angelina Jolie and she's 25 to be </v>

1222
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:35.730
<v Speaker 8>out there with the fucking roller.</v>

1223
00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:39.513
<v Speaker 8>You just be thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was going to take a long time to </v>

1224
00:57:41.231 --> 00:57:42.064
<v Speaker 8>finish though.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I like if you're both into it and this </v>

1225
00:57:44.171 --> 00:57:45.090
<v Speaker 8>is exempt.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And again,</v>

1226
00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:47.140
<v Speaker 8>again I have to be super clear about </v>
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>

1227
00:57:47.141 --> 00:57:50.980
<v Speaker 8>but I'm not exonerating rape or sexual </v>
<v Speaker 8>harassment or predatory behavior.</v>

1228
00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:51.933
<v Speaker 8>What I am saying is we have a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's weird that we separate commerce </v>

1229
00:57:57.191 --> 00:57:58.024
<v Speaker 8>from intimacy when it comes to sex and </v>
<v Speaker 8>it's the only type of intimacy you can </v>

1230
00:58:00.851 --> 00:58:04.420
<v Speaker 8>get massaged in your underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I do it all the time where women will be</v>

1231
00:58:04.421 --> 00:58:05.920
<v Speaker 8>talking to me about,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1232
00:58:05.921 --> 00:58:08.530
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>my kids go into school at this place and</v>

1233
00:58:08.531 --> 00:58:11.620
<v Speaker 8>he really likes wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but the problem is they're discontinuing</v>

1234
00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:12.880
<v Speaker 8>the program and while they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>

1235
00:58:12.881 --> 00:58:15.280
<v Speaker 8>she's digging her elbow and my back and </v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm in pain,</v>

1236
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:16.263
<v Speaker 8>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm in my underwear or alone in a room </v>

1237
00:58:18.071 --> 00:58:18.904
<v Speaker 8>with this lady and I'm having a nice </v>
<v Speaker 8>conversation with her while she's being </v>

1238
00:58:20.921 --> 00:58:21.820
<v Speaker 8>intimate with me.</v>

1239
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.650
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's essentially what's going on.</v>

1240
00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:24.613
<v Speaker 8>There's oil involved,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're massaging neck and it feels </v>

1241
00:58:26.891 --> 00:58:27.724
<v Speaker 8>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's don't shoot any fluid out of your </v>

1242
00:58:29.831 --> 00:58:32.920
<v Speaker 8>body.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We allow that to get a woody when you're</v>

1243
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:33.930
<v Speaker 8>getting a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

1244
00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:36.980
<v Speaker 8>it definitely moves.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm trying to stay calm and zen though I</v>

1245
00:58:36.981 --> 00:58:39.070
<v Speaker 8>put myself in,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in a peaceful place.</v>

1246
00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.470
<v Speaker 8>Fucking worse.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When your deck starts getting harder and</v>

1247
00:58:41.471 --> 00:58:43.420
<v Speaker 8>they're getting a platonic massage and </v>
<v Speaker 8>you're like,</v>

1248
00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:48.700
<v Speaker 8>what were like preparing your apology?</v>
<v Speaker 8>But it's because being touched.</v>

1249
00:58:48.701 --> 00:58:51.630
<v Speaker 8>We're also touched a starved.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1250
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:55.000
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in this society that I think people have</v>

1251
00:58:55.001 --> 00:58:55.834
<v Speaker 8>a hard time distinguishing between </v>
<v Speaker 8>pleasant touch and eroticism or between </v>

1252
00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:03.220
<v Speaker 8>good sex and love.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

1253
00:59:03.221 --> 00:59:06.370
<v Speaker 8>we mix it all together because we were </v>
<v Speaker 8>so unfamiliar with it.</v>

1254
00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:07.813
<v Speaker 8>There's also,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's would be levels to prostitution </v>

1255
00:59:09.731 --> 00:59:13.000
<v Speaker 8>to right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like what would be a peek ahead buddy.</v>

1256
00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:14.373
<v Speaker 8>You don't have to tell us what would be </v>
<v Speaker 8>the problem with someone who say was a </v>

1257
00:59:20.411 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 8>woman who just did not have</v>

1258
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.350
<v Speaker 6>a desire to have a family like to </v>
<v Speaker 6>freedom.</v>

1259
00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:25.423
<v Speaker 6>Didn't want to work a regular job,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but she likes having sex with men that </v>

1260
00:59:27.501 --> 00:59:29.660
<v Speaker 6>she likes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So she picks a few men.</v>

1261
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:34.930
<v Speaker 6>Maybe she's got a small roster of like </v>
<v Speaker 6>10 guys who fucker and they rotate.</v>

1262
00:59:35.331 --> 00:59:36.200

<v Speaker 3>it's no set price.</v>

1275
01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:05.350
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a thousand bucks to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>me or whatever.</v>

1276
01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:06.184

<v Speaker 3>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you want to get together again </v>

1279

<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1282
01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:20.043
<v Speaker 3>And if it's not then I'm deciding do we </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to keep seeing this dude for </v>

1283
01:00:22.811 --> 01:00:24.340
<v Speaker 3>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1284
01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.720
<v Speaker 3>Or it was 150 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1285
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:27.983
<v Speaker 3>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's like different guys depending </v>

1286
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:31.003
<v Speaker 3>how much money they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give her more or less and so she </v>

1287
01:00:33.431 --> 01:00:34.264
<v Speaker 3>can just decide at anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wants to continue the relationship </v>

1288
01:00:36.821 --> 01:00:38.950
<v Speaker 3>and she doesn't consider herself a </v>
<v Speaker 3>prostitute.</v>

1289
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:41.950
<v Speaker 3>And you go to someplace like Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1290
01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:43.323
<v Speaker 3>I met this dude in Nepal years ago who </v>
<v Speaker 3>explained to me the whole do the whole </v>

1291
01:00:46.571 --> 01:00:49.060
<v Speaker 3>deal because I've spent a lot of time in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thailand,</v>

1292
01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:53.050
<v Speaker 3>but I've never been able to wrap my head</v>
<v Speaker 3>around and I was Horny as hell,</v>

1293
01:00:53.051 --> 01:00:57.150
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't wrap my head around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and how it worked because,</v>

1294
01:00:57.490 --> 01:00:59.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting back to your rape thing,</v>

1295
01:00:59.170 --> 01:01:00.003
<v Speaker 3>to me the most demeaning experience in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world would be to find myself in a </v>

1296
01:01:04.991 --> 01:01:08.380
<v Speaker 3>sexual situation and realize that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman doesn't want to be there.</v>

1297
01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:09.260
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1298
01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:10.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1299
01:01:10.211 --> 01:01:12.070
<v Speaker 3>that's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel so ugly,</v>

1300
01:01:12.090 --> 01:01:12.923
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to be with a Thai woman and there's </v>

1301
01:01:14.981 --> 01:01:19.750
<v Speaker 3>all this confusion and she doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's acting like she wants to do this.</v>

1302
01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.550
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy explained to me,</v>

1303
01:01:21.551 --> 01:01:25.090
<v Speaker 3>he goes to Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a woman he knows there.</v>

1304
01:01:25.091 --> 01:01:25.924
<v Speaker 3>If she's not around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'll hook them up with a friend of </v>

1305
01:01:27.371 --> 01:01:28.204
<v Speaker 3>hers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but basically he'll travel with her for </v>

1306
01:01:30.611 --> 01:01:33.670
<v Speaker 3>a month or to take her all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>Thailand.</v>

1307
01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:34.623
<v Speaker 3>She translates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she gets them better deals on rooms and </v>

1308
01:01:37.271 --> 01:01:39.580
<v Speaker 3>food and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She knows what to order,</v>

1309
01:01:39.581 --> 01:01:42.340
<v Speaker 3>and Thailand is very cool about </v>
<v Speaker 3>prostitution.</v>

1310
01:01:42.341 --> 01:01:45.760
<v Speaker 3>It's Buddhist that doesn't have this </v>
<v Speaker 3>anti sex thing that we have,</v>

1311
01:01:45.761 --> 01:01:48.100
<v Speaker 3>so it's no big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1312
01:01:48.101 --> 01:01:51.280
<v Speaker 3>As far as the Thai people are concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1313
01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:54.820
<v Speaker 3>and at some point on that trip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll go to the village where she grew</v>

1314
01:01:54.821 --> 01:01:58.870
<v Speaker 3>up and they'll meet her family and he'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>

1315
01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.190
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mother's refrigerators looking kind</v>

1316
01:02:01.191 --> 01:02:03.160
<v Speaker 3>of old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is she needed a new refrigerator?</v>

1317
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be great.</v>

1318
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:07.390
<v Speaker 3>And they go buy a refrigerator and give </v>
<v Speaker 3>it to the mother and the mother.</v>

1319
01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:09.100
<v Speaker 3>Super happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the,</v>

1320
01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:12.250
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no money changing hands.</v>

1321
01:02:12.251 --> 01:02:13.084
<v Speaker 3>It's a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's very much like what you're </v>

1322
01:02:15.041 --> 01:02:17.260
<v Speaker 3>describing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's and sex.</v>

1323
01:02:17.290 --> 01:02:19.410
<v Speaker 3>It's not for the sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's sex,</v>

1324
01:02:19.411 --> 01:02:20.220
<v Speaker 3>there's friendship,</v>

1325
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.053
<v Speaker 8>there's translation,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's saving me money and telling me </v>

1326
01:02:23.371 --> 01:02:25.410
<v Speaker 8>the best places to go.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's like a guide.</v>

1327
01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.250
<v Speaker 8>And sex is just part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's a very,</v>

1328
01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:30.000
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

1329
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.150
<v Speaker 8>it's hard to conceive from our cultural </v>
<v Speaker 8>perspective,</v>

1330
01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:35.850
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that it actually works that way.</v>

1331
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:36.743
<v Speaker 8>I don't think there would be anything </v>
<v Speaker 8>wrong with a woman deciding to have sex </v>

1332
01:02:39.541 --> 01:02:40.374
<v Speaker 8>with a bunch of men for money.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

1333
01:02:42.361 --> 01:02:43.194
<v Speaker 8>with it or I think the real is comes </v>
<v Speaker 8>into having sex with somebody you don't </v>

1334
01:02:45.331 --> 01:02:46.450
<v Speaker 8>know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

1335
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.333
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you're a street walker and some guy </v>

1336
01:02:48.841 --> 01:02:50.970
<v Speaker 8>picks you up and wants to kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's the real danger.</v>

1337
01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:51.983
<v Speaker 8>The real danger is not in your clientele</v>
<v Speaker 8>unless of course one of them is a </v>

1338
01:02:54.751 --> 01:02:58.020
<v Speaker 8>fucking psycho,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I think can happen on a tinder date.</v>

1339
01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.210
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think we are.</v>

1340
01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:04.380
<v Speaker 8>We're operating under the echoes of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>puritans and uh,</v>

1341
01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.130
<v Speaker 8>I think as grown adults deep into our.</v>

1342
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:08.680
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm,</v>

1343
01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.840
<v Speaker 8>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm 50 now.</v>

1344
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:11.280
<v Speaker 8>How old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Fifty five.</v>

1345
01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:15.120
<v Speaker 8>The idea that we're still under and </v>
<v Speaker 8>you're 43.</v>

1346
01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:19.740
<v Speaker 8>Imagine being under this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The whims of some people who died,</v>

1347
01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:21.780
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>hundreds of years ago,</v>

1348
01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:24.660
<v Speaker 8>had a complete ignorance to human </v>
<v Speaker 8>psychology,</v>

1349
01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:27.990
<v Speaker 8>to physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to sexual urges to genetics.</v>

1350
01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:29.143
<v Speaker 8>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What they knew then is literally </v>

1351
01:03:30.901 --> 01:03:34.750
<v Speaker 8>flavoring the way we behave today.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's so insanely suppressive.</v>

1352
01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:35.593
<v Speaker 8>It's good point.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I also have a point about all this </v>

1353
01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:39.383
<v Speaker 8>sexual harassment stuff that's </v>
<v Speaker 8>uncomfortable and this is those </v>

1354
01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:45.324
<v Speaker 8>environments become your world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you're in an office eight hours a </v>

1355
01:03:49.321 --> 01:03:51.690
<v Speaker 8>day,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that is most of your day.</v>

1356
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:55.050
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Most of your waking conscious day you're</v>

1357
01:03:55.051 --> 01:03:55.884
<v Speaker 8>spending in this one area and people,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they start behaving like that's the </v>

1358
01:04:00.691 --> 01:04:04.650
<v Speaker 8>world and you start becoming sexually </v>
<v Speaker 8>attracted to the people that are in your</v>

1359
01:04:04.651 --> 01:04:07.950
<v Speaker 8>world and some people reciprocate and </v>
<v Speaker 8>some do not.</v>

1360
01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:08.903
<v Speaker 8>Some people are frustrated and some are </v>
<v Speaker 8>not and some people are gross and </v>

1361
01:04:11.641 --> 01:04:12.474
<v Speaker 8>they're in a position of power in that </v>
<v Speaker 8>weird world and I think maybe that guy </v>

1362
01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:18.390
<v Speaker 8>wouldn't sexually harassed in the big </v>
<v Speaker 8>world,</v>

1363
01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.553
<v Speaker 8>but in this little world where </v>
<v Speaker 8>everything's jammed in together and you </v>

1364
01:04:21.811 --> 01:04:22.644
<v Speaker 8>have these clearly defined things like </v>
<v Speaker 8>this guy has got a plaque on his desk </v>

1365
01:04:25.231 --> 01:04:26.970
<v Speaker 8>that says the boss.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right,</v>

1366
01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:28.770
<v Speaker 8>and you got to come in and he's got the </v>
<v Speaker 8>desk.</v>

1367
01:04:28.771 --> 01:04:30.030
<v Speaker 8>Come on and shut the door.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Shut the door.</v>

1368
01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.073
<v Speaker 8>Or if you like Matt Lauer,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you've got a button where you lock the </v>

1369
01:04:32.731 --> 01:04:34.140
<v Speaker 8>door,</v>
<v Speaker 8>click fuck.</v>

1370
01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:34.891
<v Speaker 8>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Inside.</v>

1371
01:04:34.891 --> 01:04:37.290
<v Speaker 8>We've got to discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We've got to review your progress.</v>

1372
01:04:37.291 --> 01:04:39.870
<v Speaker 8>This click,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is the world,</v>

1373
01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:41.940
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not exonerating.</v>

1374
01:04:41.941 --> 01:04:43.500
<v Speaker 8>Matt Lauer can't believe I'd say the </v>
<v Speaker 8>scan,</v>

1375
01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:46.500
<v Speaker 8>but if you're in that guy's world and I </v>
<v Speaker 8>don't even know what he did,</v>

1376
01:04:46.501 --> 01:04:47.430
<v Speaker 8>I didn't pay attention.</v>

1377
01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:50.250
<v Speaker 8>I met him once.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was quite a gentleman,</v>

1378
01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:54.030
<v Speaker 8>but he's in this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's got to be working 10,</v>

1379
01:04:54.031 --> 01:04:56.460
<v Speaker 8>12 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're doing the today show.</v>

1380
01:04:56.790 --> 01:04:59.340
<v Speaker 8>It's insanely competitive that morning </v>
<v Speaker 8>TV thing.</v>

1381
01:04:59.341 --> 01:05:01.590
<v Speaker 8>You have to be on the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you have meetings,</v>

1382
01:05:01.591 --> 01:05:04.050
<v Speaker 8>you have fucking stuff to review.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You have guests.</v>

1383
01:05:04.051 --> 01:05:08.130
<v Speaker 8>Are you going to review your performance</v>
<v Speaker 8>in your conversations with people and.</v>

1384
01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:08.820
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Matt,</v>

1385
01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.290
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whenever you start talking about sex,</v>

1386
01:05:10.291 --> 01:05:11.460
<v Speaker 8>people drop off.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>

1387
01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:14.100
<v Speaker 8>we've got the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We have the chart in the direct relation</v>

1388
01:05:14.101 --> 01:05:17.010
<v Speaker 8>to what you were saying earlier is what </v>
<v Speaker 8>I read about Matt Lauer was,</v>

1389
01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:17.950
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he,</v>

1390
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:18.250
<v Speaker 8>he</v>

1391
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.083
<v Speaker 1>couldn't have sex with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just normal people because he's famous </v>

1392
01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1393
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:24.063
<v Speaker 1>he'd get in trouble and he's married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had to maintain the facade of </v>

1394
01:05:26.711 --> 01:05:27.544
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He and he couldn't have sex with other </v>

1395
01:05:29.321 --> 01:05:31.570
<v Speaker 1>famous people because that would come </v>
<v Speaker 1>out into the press.</v>

1396
01:05:31.571 --> 01:05:33.640
<v Speaker 1>So he had to have sex with people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't famous,</v>

1397
01:05:33.641 --> 01:05:35.950
<v Speaker 1>they weren't just normal people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that left the office.</v>

1398
01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:37.383
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine if we lived in a world where </v>

1399
01:05:39.851 --> 01:05:41.740
<v Speaker 1>we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gives a shit if Matt Lauer's fucking</v>

1400
01:05:41.741 --> 01:05:43.800
<v Speaker 1>someone other than his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's between them.</v>

1401
01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:44.650
<v Speaker 1>The sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1402
01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:46.643
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that that was back when </v>

1403
01:05:48.461 --> 01:05:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Dustin Hoffman was grabbing titties </v>
<v Speaker 1>acute,</v>

1404
01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:53.230
<v Speaker 1>and if you guys ever seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way last,</v>

1405
01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>sorry the last word on this for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

1406
01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:57.363
<v Speaker 1>the people who are acting shocked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>outraged around Matt Lauer and Charlie </v>

1407
01:06:00.341 --> 01:06:02.700
<v Speaker 1>rose are full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what.</v>

1408
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:03.633
<v Speaker 1>That's what kills me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hypocrisy of the people who've been </v>

1409
01:06:05.921 --> 01:06:08.060
<v Speaker 1>working with them for years and going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1410
01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:09.083
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard about Charlie rose being a </v>

1411
01:06:11.351 --> 01:06:14.560
<v Speaker 1>fucking creep 15 years ago and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even work in media.</v>

1412
01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:17.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the bill cosby thing.</v>

1413
01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Open the bill cosby thing was an open.</v>

1414
01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Have you see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you guys seen this?</v>

1415
01:06:21.921 --> 01:06:22.754
<v Speaker 2>Is one of the grossest things you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>witness in a workplace is when the boss </v>

1416
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:30.080
<v Speaker 2>starts giving fucking neck rubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen that?</v>

1417
01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:31.243
<v Speaker 2>A neck rub and boss though it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is so fucking creepy to watch a big </v>

1418
01:06:38.211 --> 01:06:42.980
<v Speaker 2>fat fucking boss saddling up behind some</v>
<v Speaker 2>married secretary.</v>

1419
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.073
<v Speaker 2>Just so how are you doing the day carol </v>
<v Speaker 2>rubbing her neck and she could see the </v>

1420
01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:51.620
<v Speaker 2>look on her face frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got kids.</v>

1421
01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:53.690
<v Speaker 2>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she says to him,</v>

1422
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you mind?</v>

1423
01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:57.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't really want you to touch me </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1424
01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.760
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1425
01:06:58.761 --> 01:07:03.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then she doesn't know down the line,</v>

1426
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:05.930
<v Speaker 2>down the line when he's doing employee </v>
<v Speaker 2>reviews and he's thinking,</v>

1427
01:07:05.931 --> 01:07:07.790
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ruin that fucking time.</v>

1428
01:07:07.791 --> 01:07:09.620
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to rub her back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1429
01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.340
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not rubbing any of the dudes </v>
<v Speaker 2>backs in the office.</v>

1430
01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:18.470
<v Speaker 2>Now that man that is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is one of the sleaziest slimy.</v>

1431
01:07:18.471 --> 01:07:22.580
<v Speaker 2>His things and to imagine when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>the boss,</v>

1432
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:25.880
<v Speaker 2>to imagine that these bosses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're oblivious,</v>

1433
01:07:25.881 --> 01:07:26.714
<v Speaker 2>they just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want to give them that </v>

1434
01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:29.630
<v Speaker 2>corrupts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not aware like come on.</v>

1435
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:32.900
<v Speaker 2>They can feel that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's rubbing their back.</v>

1436
01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:33.883
<v Speaker 2>If you can't feel their fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam's trying to escape your sweaty God </v>

1437
01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:40.780
<v Speaker 2>fucking male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dominator.</v>

1438
01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:42.913
<v Speaker 1>How many guys become friends with women?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have Air tag friends just so they just </v>

1439
01:07:47.901 --> 01:07:48.734
<v Speaker 1>creep and closer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like your stock and big game and </v>

1440
01:07:51.261 --> 01:07:55.460
<v Speaker 1>you want to just move real close to flow</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what they're doing.</v>

1441
01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:58.190
<v Speaker 1>One of the classics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I hunt elk.</v>

1442
01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I walk real slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give it an echo now.</v>

1443
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Don't give it a try not to make my </v>
<v Speaker 1>intentions known.</v>

1444
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:07.190
<v Speaker 1>That is what's happening in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>

1445
01:08:07.191 --> 01:08:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I think when people work in offices </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

1446
01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.440
<v Speaker 1>they get attracted to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whitney.</v>

<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1448
01:08:14.691 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I won't.</v>

1449
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:17.360
<v Speaker 6>it justice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to say it,</v>

1450
01:08:17.361 --> 01:08:20.090
<v Speaker 6>but she talks about working in an office</v>
<v Speaker 6>because she's,</v>

1451
01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:21.650
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she works on Rosanne.</v>

<v Speaker 6>She's on the staff,</v>

1453
01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.510
<v Speaker 6>like she's in an office all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>this is what people do that it's this </v>
<v Speaker 6>weird environment and office romances </v>

<v Speaker 9>Plus together they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 9>attractive and if you're.</v>

1457
01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:40.913
<v Speaker 6>If you're married to some guy and he </v>
<v Speaker 6>said he's the big boss and it says that </v>

1458
01:08:43.471 --> 01:08:44.304
<v Speaker 6>on his breastplate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the big boss and the big pause as a </v>

1459
01:08:45.931 --> 01:08:46.764

<v Speaker 9>But man,</v>

1490
01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:16.120
<v Speaker 9>when you think about that much work </v>
<v Speaker 9>done,</v>

1491
01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:20.890
<v Speaker 9>when you think about fucking being </v>
<v Speaker 9>denise and who's this dude's name?</v>

1492
01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.350
<v Speaker 9>That Guy Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Mike,</v>

1493
01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:23.960
<v Speaker 9>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Tara.</v>

1494
01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:24.913
<v Speaker 9>When you're fucking didn't hear denise </v>
<v Speaker 9>and you got this job and there's Mike </v>

<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>

1498
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.830
<v Speaker 9>I thought Mike just had a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 9>responsibility,</v>

1499
01:10:38.831 --> 01:10:42.610
<v Speaker 9>but I thought mix a big burly guy maybe </v>
<v Speaker 9>eat a little too much and drank a little</v>

1500
01:10:42.611 --> 01:10:43.444
<v Speaker 9>too much company or sanitation motto.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Lot of work responsibility and Mike </v>

<v Speaker 9>A should see denise's ex husband,</v>
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

1504
01:10:56.770 --> 01:10:57.603
<v Speaker 9>Denise has a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 9>has a kid with a guy who was a real </v>

1505
01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:04.090
<v Speaker 9>piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm saying what's happening right now,</v>

1506
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:05.343
<v Speaker 9>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what's happening is there's been a lot </v>

1507
01:11:06.881 --> 01:11:09.310
<v Speaker 9>of fucking slimy massages that have been</v>
<v Speaker 9>going on.</v>

1508
01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:12.850
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to guess for about 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 9>years.</v>

1509
01:11:12.851 --> 01:11:13.684
<v Speaker 9>There's been a lot</v>

1510
01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:18.750
<v Speaker 2>more than 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years is slimy massages.</v>

1511
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.823
<v Speaker 2>It's been building up like the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>yellow stone super called there and in </v>

1512
01:11:23.311 --> 01:11:26.760
<v Speaker 2>the fucking like epigenetic Dna of </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

1513
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:30.030
<v Speaker 2>There is probably somewhere in coded in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1514
01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.073
<v Speaker 2>just millennia of creepy fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>massages that don't stop with the </v>

1515
01:11:35.521 --> 01:11:37.890
<v Speaker 2>fucking massage depending on what time </v>
<v Speaker 2>period you're in.</v>

1516
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:38.933
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I think that what we're feeling </v>

1517
01:11:40.291 --> 01:11:45.291
<v Speaker 2>right now is the result of generations </v>
<v Speaker 2>of creepy fucking massages and much,</v>

1518
01:11:48.661 --> 01:11:51.060
<v Speaker 2>much worse happening.</v>

<v Speaker 2>this is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is truly got to be one of the </v>

1550
01:13:18.571 --> 01:13:20.770
<v Speaker 2>circles of fucking hell right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because like,</v>

1551

<v Speaker 2>His legs are spread.</v>

1553
01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:30.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I put it in just doing you?</v>

1554
01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:31.771
<v Speaker 2>Can I prove it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1555
01:13:31.771 --> 01:13:32.604
<v Speaker 2>for right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think people were doing </v>

1556
01:13:33.511 --> 01:13:35.790
<v Speaker 2>yoga in North Carolina at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he was a woman,</v>

1557
01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:36.624
<v Speaker 2>you would assume that those actions </v>
<v Speaker 2>would indicate that she would want </v>

1558
01:13:38.341 --> 01:13:39.174
<v Speaker 2>sexual intercourse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying there was a feeling now </v>

1559
01:13:41.221 --> 01:13:43.110
<v Speaker 2>whether I could prove it or whether it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just me or whatever.</v>

1560
01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties.</v>

1562
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a feeling that this sucks,</v>

1563
01:13:48.421 --> 01:13:50.130
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more going on here.</v>

1564
01:13:50.131 --> 01:13:51.060

<v Speaker 2>This sucks.</v>

1565
01:13:51.061 --> 01:13:52.800
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a legal.</v>

1566
01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:53.551
<v Speaker 2>Is it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could I.</v>

1567
01:13:53.551 --> 01:13:55.660
<v Speaker 2>is it even sexual harassment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1568
01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.790
<v Speaker 2>but it sucks and it's like it sucks </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1569
01:13:59.791 --> 01:14:00.960
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1570
01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:02.063
<v Speaker 2>that is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what a lot of fucking women had been </v>

1571
01:14:04.381 --> 01:14:09.381
<v Speaker 2>dealing with for a long time and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>pissed and they're rightfully rightfully</v>

1572
01:14:10.291 --> 01:14:11.710
<v Speaker 2>fucking pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1573
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:15.310
<v Speaker 2>who wants to be dominated like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm getting dominated,</v>

1574
01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.770
<v Speaker 2>I want to be paying for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1575
01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:19.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it.</v>

1576
01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.630
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no doubt man.</v>

1577
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:26.623
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really do think there's something to </v>

1578
01:14:28.211 --> 01:14:33.211
<v Speaker 6>this idea that humans aren't meant to be</v>
<v Speaker 6>in these small areas totally enclosed in</v>

1579
01:14:34.451 --> 01:14:37.330
<v Speaker 6>together with each other all day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think we're designed for it.</v>

1580
01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:38.203
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just don't think that's an intimate </v>

1581
01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:41.500
<v Speaker 6>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As weird as that sounds.</v>

1582
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:42.663
<v Speaker 6>And this is not saying that men and </v>
<v Speaker 6>women can't work together and be </v>

1583
01:14:45.401 --> 01:14:46.350
<v Speaker 6>totally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1584
01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:48.520
<v Speaker 6>platonic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they absolutely can.</v>

1585
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:49.383
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's,</v>

1586
01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:50.513
<v Speaker 6>it's a super unnatural behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unnatural environment to be in these </v>

1587
01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.393
<v Speaker 6>cubicles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You small little boxed in offices </v>

1588
01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.560
<v Speaker 6>working day in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>day out with people,</v>

1589
01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:01.690
<v Speaker 6>smelling them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

1590
01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:04.270
<v Speaker 6>I think we should outlaw offices.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1591
01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:08.100
<v Speaker 6>We have to get shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Working at home,</v>

1592
01:15:08.101 --> 01:15:08.934
<v Speaker 6>a kiss for it</v>

1593
01:15:10.650 --> 01:15:15.650
<v Speaker 2>solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but definitely protected by the state.</v>

1594
01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:20.000
<v Speaker 2>The state man who's going to fix the </v>
<v Speaker 2>roads,</v>

1595
01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:24.190
<v Speaker 2>we could fix the roads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll figure it out.</v>

1596
01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:25.240
<v Speaker 2>We'll figure it out.</v>

1597
01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:26.073
<v Speaker 6>We were talking about something earlier </v>
<v Speaker 6>that I wrote down because I wanted to </v>

1598
01:15:27.941 --> 01:15:28.774
<v Speaker 6>remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were saying about Bob Dylan's </v>

1599
01:15:30.701 --> 01:15:34.300
<v Speaker 6>version of all along the watchtower </v>
<v Speaker 6>versus Jimi Hendrix.</v>

1600
01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:35.493
<v Speaker 6>I think Jimi Hendrix was amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but Bob Dylan's was his and he wrote it </v>

1601
01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:42.820
<v Speaker 6>and it was something cool about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Listen to those words.</v>

<v Speaker 9>I got saved in a tupperware.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Just shake it first dude.</v>

1716
01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:42.593
<v Speaker 9>Once,</v>
<v Speaker 9>once,</v>

1717
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:47.430
<v Speaker 9>once I got it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I got home after the show I've flown and</v>

1718
01:21:47.431 --> 01:21:51.510
<v Speaker 9>someone had given me this framed picture</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I have this frame picture.</v>

1719
01:21:51.511 --> 01:21:54.180
<v Speaker 9>I don't remember what the art was.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like a skull or something.</v>

1720
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:55.303
<v Speaker 9>I wasn't somehow like I ended up pulling</v>
<v Speaker 9>the thing open and inside the picture </v>

1721
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:02.423
<v Speaker 9>was a fucking joint.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The guy had shoved a joint into the </v>

1722
01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:09.620
<v Speaker 9>picture and I had flown with it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So if they had,</v>

1723
01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:13.440
<v Speaker 9>if they had like seeing if they'd open </v>
<v Speaker 9>that shit up,</v>

1724
01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:16.830
<v Speaker 9>they would have seen a joint and I </v>
<v Speaker 9>would've had to been like,</v>

1725
01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:17.664
<v Speaker 9>Nah man,</v>
<v Speaker 9>somebody gave that to me to show it was </v>

1726
01:22:19.561 --> 01:22:23.940
<v Speaker 9>fucking hippie shit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Dumb ass trying to smuggle one joint.</v>

1727
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:28.380
<v Speaker 9>So it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's tricky,</v>

1728
01:22:28.381 --> 01:22:29.970
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You can really get in trouble.</v>

1729
01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:32.210
<v Speaker 9>Had An interesting experience recently </v>
<v Speaker 9>at Heathrow.</v>

1730
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:33.103
<v Speaker 9>I don't know if.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Did you want to talk about this in New </v>

1731
01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:34.620
<v Speaker 9>York?</v>

1732
01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:37.150
<v Speaker 9>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was flying through Heathrow and uh,</v>

1733
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:40.560
<v Speaker 9>I had a connecting flight,</v>
<v Speaker 9>miss the connecting flight,</v>

1734
01:22:40.561 --> 01:22:42.420
<v Speaker 9>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's another one two hours later.</v>

1735
01:22:42.421 --> 01:22:43.254
<v Speaker 9>So I'm going through security because </v>
<v Speaker 9>you have to like go again through </v>

1736
01:22:45.871 --> 01:22:48.150
<v Speaker 9>security at Heathrow when you're coming </v>
<v Speaker 9>from outside Europe.</v>

1737
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:49.703
<v Speaker 9>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm standing in their way and they take </v>

1738
01:22:51.871 --> 01:22:52.704
<v Speaker 9>my bag for a secondary check and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I see the woman talked to the boss </v>

1739
01:22:56.581 --> 01:22:58.710
<v Speaker 9>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we'll use the other one over there.</v>

1740
01:22:58.711 --> 01:23:02.730
<v Speaker 9>So she takes my bag over to this other,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a security line that's not functioning.</v>

1741
01:23:02.731 --> 01:23:04.260
<v Speaker 9>And she runs it through the machine </v>
<v Speaker 9>there.</v>

1742
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:06.020
<v Speaker 9>She comes back and they talk for</v>

1743
01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:07.540
<v Speaker 1>a minute and he comes over to me and he </v>

<v Speaker 1>They use that for bombs.</v>

1759
01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:40.700
<v Speaker 1>So he's a surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1760
01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:41.411
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

1762
01:23:43.991 --> 01:23:46.270
<v Speaker 1>so I have to call the police.</v>

<v Speaker 1>shut off the other machine.</v>

1766
01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:53.973
<v Speaker 1>They're never wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to sit down right </v>

1767
01:23:55.571 --> 01:23:58.180
<v Speaker 1>there and wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he tells this other guy,</v>

1768
01:23:58.181 --> 01:23:59.710
<v Speaker 1>watch him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't let him go anywhere.</v>

01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna make a run for it,</v>

1770
01:24:01.361 --> 01:24:03.910
<v Speaker 1>and he threw and these cops show up </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1771
01:24:03.911 --> 01:24:08.911
<v Speaker 1>and they were like nine cops and body </v>
<v Speaker 1>armor like surrounded me and you know,</v>

1772
01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:10.900
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1773
01:24:10.901 --> 01:24:15.901
<v Speaker 1>this is what it feels like to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you are also a 55 year old white guy</v>

1774
01:24:16.571 --> 01:24:20.230
<v Speaker 1>who's obviously well educated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not speaking with a weird accent.</v>

1775
01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm thinking.</v>

1776
01:24:22.181 --> 01:24:24.880
<v Speaker 1>So if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were black or you're whatever,</v>

1777
01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:27.250
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've been terrified.</v>

1778
01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the video that I posted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy that got gunned down?</v>

1779
01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

1780
01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:33.790
<v Speaker 1>So horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

1781
01:24:33.810 --> 01:24:35.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was murdered.</v>

1782
01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:38.020
<v Speaker 1>And also why do you have to crawl across</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking floor?</v>

1783
01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:38.853
<v Speaker 1>How does they put your hands over your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head and we come over and cuff you </v>

1784
01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.600
<v Speaker 1>because they wanted to clear the room </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's near the room.</v>

1785
01:24:43.601 --> 01:24:45.160
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want them to be too close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room.</v>

1786
01:24:45.161 --> 01:24:45.994
<v Speaker 1>The room was slightly around the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way that guy escalated it was </v>

1787
01:24:49.331 --> 01:24:54.331
<v Speaker 1>playing a game of Simon says with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I will fucking shoot you.</v>

1788
01:24:54.881 --> 01:24:58.000
<v Speaker 1>And then did shoot him for just reaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to grab his pants.</v>

1789
01:24:58.001 --> 01:25:00.250
<v Speaker 1>His pants were falling down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was as he was crawling,</v>

1790
01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:02.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in no way,</v>

1791
01:25:02.561 --> 01:25:04.450
<v Speaker 1>looked like he was doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

1792
01:25:04.690 --> 01:25:05.523
<v Speaker 1>But the most fucking disturbing thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>was how many people in the comments </v>

1793
01:25:08.021 --> 01:25:10.750
<v Speaker 1>after I posted that video on twitter,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He didn't comply and clean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>killed him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>If you give someone a hammer,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just fucking insane.</v>

1821
01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.353

<v Speaker 1>human beings in an interaction and that </v>

1822
01:26:34.911 --> 01:26:35.744
<v Speaker 1>one human being has that much power over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other one that he can yell at them </v>

<v Speaker 1>someone calls the police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to have a toy gun,</v>

1829
01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:59.330
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to have a gun gun in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arizona.</v>

1830
01:26:59.450 --> 01:27:00.283
<v Speaker 1>I read that he was state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was an exterminator and he had like </v>

1831
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:04.183
<v Speaker 1>22 or something that he used for </v>
<v Speaker 1>extermination in the room and somebody </v>

1832
01:27:07.011 --> 01:27:10.010
<v Speaker 1>saw through the window him holding a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rifle,</v>

1833
01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:13.900
<v Speaker 1>but you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are legal thing,</v>

1834
01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:17.420
<v Speaker 1>unless someone just got completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>hysterical and called and said,</v>

1835
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:18.403
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy's pointing the gun out the </v>

1836
01:27:19.041 --> 01:27:21.260
<v Speaker 1>window at people and this is the message</v>
<v Speaker 1>that got in.</v>

1837
01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:24.740
<v Speaker 1>The cops don't know when they show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you see that guy and that woman</v>

1838
01:27:24.770 --> 01:27:25.603
<v Speaker 1>and you just see their fucking body </v>
<v Speaker 1>language as they're walking down the </v>

1839
01:27:28.041 --> 01:27:29.390
<v Speaker 1>hallway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super casual,</v>

1840
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:31.610
<v Speaker 1>they're not walking like people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>about to kill people.</v>

1841
01:27:31.930 --> 01:27:33.740
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they comply immediately.</v>

1842
01:27:33.741 --> 01:27:36.470
<v Speaker 1>The guys begging for his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please don't shoot me.</v>

1843
01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:40.100
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1844
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:41.263
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I mean this gets back to we were </v>

1845
01:27:42.441 --> 01:27:43.274
<v Speaker 1>talking about with the women this moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>in history where women are tired of the </v>

1846
01:27:45.621 --> 01:27:46.454
<v Speaker 1>sleazy hand rubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're also at the moment were </v>

1847
01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:49.483
<v Speaker 1>nonwhite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are fucking tired of being done </v>

1848
01:27:51.741 --> 01:27:52.790
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's.</v>

1849
01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:56.100
<v Speaker 1>This is a white guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know what I'm saying?</v>

1850
01:27:56.190 --> 01:27:57.740
<v Speaker 1>This is everybody so imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1851
01:27:57.741 --> 01:27:58.880
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's everyone.</v>

1852
01:27:58.881 --> 01:28:00.890
<v Speaker 1>It shows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens to white people sometimes.</v>

1853
01:28:00.891 --> 01:28:02.570
<v Speaker 1>But imagine the black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1854
01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:03.110
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

1855
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:05.030
<v Speaker 1>I got in Albuquerque,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homeless dude,</v>

1856
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:08.990
<v Speaker 1>and they fucking throw grenades and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts running.</v>

1857
01:28:08.991 --> 01:28:09.591
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

1858
01:28:09.591 --> 01:28:11.820
<v Speaker 1>this happened like two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a homeless guy.</v>

1859
01:28:11.821 --> 01:28:15.710
<v Speaker 1>He's sleeping right out in the bush </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere near Albuquerque.</v>

1860
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:18.140
<v Speaker 1>And the cops come out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they throw a flash.</v>

1861
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Flash grenade scares the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1862
01:28:20.751 --> 01:28:22.190
<v Speaker 1>He jumps up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts running away.</v>

1863
01:28:22.191 --> 01:28:23.024
<v Speaker 1>They got him down from the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shoot them in the back as he's </v>

1864
01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:26.570
<v Speaker 1>running away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like.</v>

1865
01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:28.560
<v Speaker 1>And they were acquitted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1866
01:28:28.670 --> 01:28:30.290
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nuts.</v>

1867
01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:33.950
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no accountability.</v>

1868
01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:35.840
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

1869
01:28:36.190 --> 01:28:38.840
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1870
01:28:38.841 --> 01:28:39.674
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the line that a thing it was </v>

1871
01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin Franklin or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or one of the founding fathers said that</v>

1872
01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:47.540
<v Speaker 1>the police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revolution,</v>

1873
01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:49.563
<v Speaker 1>the revolution occasionally has to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fed with the blood of their </v>

1874
01:28:57.890 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 1>history of liberty must sometimes be </v>
<v Speaker 1>watered with</v>

1875
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.200
<v Speaker 7>the blood of Patriots.</v>

1876
01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.560
<v Speaker 9>Martyrs.</v>
<v Speaker 9>What?</v>

1877
01:29:06.561 --> 01:29:08.130
<v Speaker 9>A fucked up tree.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Hey man,</v>

1878
01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:10.360
<v Speaker 9>why you got that in your garden,</v>
<v Speaker 9>man,</v>

1879
01:29:11.850 --> 01:29:13.460
<v Speaker 9>that's fucking get that thing out of </v>
<v Speaker 9>your.</v>

1880
01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:16.153
<v Speaker 9>But don't you think there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 9>cleansing revolution that has to happen </v>

1881
01:29:19.161 --> 01:29:20.120
<v Speaker 9>every once in a while.</v>

1882
01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:22.620
<v Speaker 6>I think what we're experiencing now as </v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

1883
01:29:22.650 --> 01:29:23.483
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what we're getting from information </v>

1884
01:29:24.541 --> 01:29:25.374
<v Speaker 6>right and where we're getting from this </v>
<v Speaker 6>use of the Internet is the ability to </v>

1885
01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:28.284
<v Speaker 6>spread information instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This video could have existed decades </v>

1886
01:29:31.710 --> 01:29:33.350
<v Speaker 6>ago and we've never seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1887
01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:34.293
<v Speaker 6>and there would be no need for potty </v>
<v Speaker 6>cameras back then either they didn't </v>

1888
01:29:36.241 --> 01:29:37.740
<v Speaker 6>have the technology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So now they do.</v>

1889
01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:41.910
<v Speaker 6>Everyone has to have a body camera.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guy did this knowing he was filming</v>

1890
01:29:41.911 --> 01:29:44.430
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is even more insane.</v>

1891
01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:47.970
<v Speaker 6>Like imagine this guy completely </v>
<v Speaker 6>unfiltered,</v>

1892
01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:48.893
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1893
01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:52.910
<v Speaker 6>he might've just gone that guy down for </v>
<v Speaker 6>the fuck of it as soon as he saw him.</v>

1894
01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.153
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he might be just a guy looking to shoot </v>

1895
01:29:56.251 --> 01:29:57.810
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is real.</v>

1896
01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:58.241
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1897
01:29:58.241 --> 01:29:59.980
<v Speaker 7>this is the thing that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is like you're saying,</v>

1898
01:30:00.010 --> 01:30:00.350
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>priests,</v>

1900
01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:03.920
<v Speaker 7>molesting kids.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1901
01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:05.560
<v Speaker 7>and why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1902
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:06.423
<v Speaker 7>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know why there are so many are </v>

1903
01:30:09.761 --> 01:30:13.250
<v Speaker 7>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but one thing's for sure sociopath's and</v>

1904
01:30:13.290 --> 01:30:16.690
<v Speaker 7>people who are trying to do fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 7>shit.</v>

<v Speaker 9>So she said she.</v>
<v Speaker 9>She was joking on this podcast I did </v>

1911
01:30:28.091 --> 01:30:28.924
<v Speaker 9>with her.</v>
<v Speaker 9>She was like,</v>

1912
01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:30.073
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think I've gained the system because </v>

1913
01:30:31.131 --> 01:30:35.380
<v Speaker 9>what I love the most in sex is DP and </v>
<v Speaker 9>that's what they pay the most for now.</v>

1914
01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:39.140
<v Speaker 9>What he being doubled penetration for </v>
<v Speaker 9>some people aren't fucked up.</v>

1915
01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:43.460
<v Speaker 9>Both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Brand new new listeners.</v>

1916
01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:47.340
<v Speaker 9>What that shows.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's a person who</v>

1917
01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:51.120
<v Speaker 7>figured out truly you'd figured out how </v>
<v Speaker 7>to make money doing what she loves.</v>

1918
01:30:51.450 --> 01:30:55.590
<v Speaker 7>And so in the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you have these fucking sociopath,</v>

1919
01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:58.530
<v Speaker 7>these pedophiles who want to make a </v>
<v Speaker 7>career,</v>

1920
01:30:59.000 --> 01:30:59.833
<v Speaker 7>we want to figure out a way to do what </v>
<v Speaker 7>they're doing while while like </v>

1921
01:31:01.791 --> 01:31:03.700
<v Speaker 7>sustaining themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1922
01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:04.621
<v Speaker 7>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1923
01:31:04.621 --> 01:31:07.680
<v Speaker 7>I'll just become a priest.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If I become a priest I'm going to have.</v>

1924
01:31:07.681 --> 01:31:08.514
<v Speaker 7>And it's all power.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All talking power dynamics here because </v>

1925
01:31:11.161 --> 01:31:16.161
<v Speaker 7>it's like it's not enough the you're an </v>
<v Speaker 7>older man and you're helpless kid,</v>

1926
01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:17.933
<v Speaker 7>but on top of that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 7>representative of the creative force of </v>

1927
01:31:21.271 --> 01:31:24.810
<v Speaker 7>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're like the fucking spokesperson for</v>

1928
01:31:24.811 --> 01:31:25.644
<v Speaker 7>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The power dynamic there is a is it's </v>

1929
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:31.500
<v Speaker 7>almost as skewed as it can fucking get </v>
<v Speaker 7>it in the same way that guy,</v>

1930
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:33.870
<v Speaker 7>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1931
01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:35.640
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you think when that guy goes home,</v>

1932
01:31:35.970 --> 01:31:36.803
<v Speaker 7>he's like listening to sounds of </v>
<v Speaker 7>waterfalls and shit and taking baths </v>

1933
01:31:39.481 --> 01:31:40.620
<v Speaker 7>with lavender candles.</v>

1934
01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:41.753
<v Speaker 7>That guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That guy goes fucking home and he just </v>

1935
01:31:43.410 --> 01:31:45.720
<v Speaker 7>probably just fucking punches a brick </v>
<v Speaker 7>wall.</v>

1936
01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:47.700
<v Speaker 7>He just punches.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Was He?</v>

1937
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:50.340
<v Speaker 7>He's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that guy is not a happy dude.</v>

1938
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:51.233
<v Speaker 7>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he likes to dominate people and he </v>

1939
01:31:52.831 --> 01:31:55.380
<v Speaker 7>wants to be in control and he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 7>have power.</v>

1940
01:31:55.560 --> 01:32:00.560
<v Speaker 7>And he got himself into a job where he </v>
<v Speaker 7>could be a get paid to be the worst kind</v>

1941
01:32:01.121 --> 01:32:01.954
<v Speaker 7>of murderous bully there is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's what's really happening is </v>

1942
01:32:04.541 --> 01:32:05.374
<v Speaker 7>that we have in our society monsters and</v>
<v Speaker 7>the monsters are smart and they're </v>

1943
01:32:10.631 --> 01:32:13.510
<v Speaker 7>figuring out ways to get in positions of</v>
<v Speaker 7>power.</v>

1944
01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:16.000
<v Speaker 7>And We,</v>
<v Speaker 7>before the bloody revolution,</v>

1945
01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:17.163
<v Speaker 7>we just need to come up with better ways</v>
<v Speaker 7>to scan for these fucking assholes so </v>

1946
01:32:20.531 --> 01:32:24.820
<v Speaker 7>that we can keep them out of these </v>
<v Speaker 7>positions of power not scanned for them.</v>

1947
01:32:24.821 --> 01:32:25.654
<v Speaker 7>We encouraged them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The system is built in such a way that </v>

1948
01:32:28.211 --> 01:32:29.044
<v Speaker 7>they're encouraged.</v>

1949
01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:30.063
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's no accident that we ended up with </v>

1950
01:32:31.571 --> 01:32:34.750
<v Speaker 7>psychopaths as president.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who the fuck else would want to do that?</v>

1951
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:38.350
<v Speaker 7>Who seeks a psychopath?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't either.</v>

1952
01:32:38.351 --> 01:32:42.490
<v Speaker 7>I think Obama and Jimmy Carter,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or to a real exceptions to that,</v>

1953
01:32:42.610 --> 01:32:43.300
<v Speaker 7>we'll wait.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1954
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:44.133
<v Speaker 7>we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think psychopath is the right </v>

1955
01:32:45.131 --> 01:32:46.230
<v Speaker 7>word for it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we do do.</v>

1956
01:32:46.231 --> 01:32:48.300
<v Speaker 7>You do kind of have to come up with low </v>
<v Speaker 7>maniac.</v>

1957
01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:50.560
<v Speaker 7>Well you need to come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 7>definition of terms,</v>

1958
01:32:50.561 --> 01:32:52.450
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's like for example,</v>

1959
01:32:52.451 --> 01:32:53.284
<v Speaker 7>like Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you gonna have to come up with an </v>

1960
01:32:54.121 --> 01:32:58.300
<v Speaker 7>inarguable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Things like Obama for sure ordered drone</v>

1961
01:32:58.301 --> 01:32:59.134
<v Speaker 7>strikes that killed people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So if you order a drone strike and it </v>

1962
01:33:01.481 --> 01:33:04.570
<v Speaker 7>kills people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are you a murderer or that's a question.</v>

1963
01:33:04.571 --> 01:33:06.850
<v Speaker 7>Are you a murderer?</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you order a drone strike and it kills</v>

1964
01:33:06.851 --> 01:33:07.550
<v Speaker 7>people.</v>

1965
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:08.383
<v Speaker 8>And the numbers are insane.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The number of innocence is in the high </v>

1966
01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.800
<v Speaker 8>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Does that make you a murderer?</v>

1967
01:33:12.801 --> 01:33:14.650
<v Speaker 8>Does that make you a murderer?</v>
<v Speaker 8>80,000</v>

1968
01:33:14.710 --> 01:33:16.440
<v Speaker 8>now percent.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh percent.</v>

1969
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:17.383
<v Speaker 8>Like if you have a dentist before Jamie </v>
<v Speaker 8>with the number of innocence killed by </v>

1970
01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:23.683
<v Speaker 8>drone strikes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it's in somewhere in the 80 </v>

1971
01:33:25.251 --> 01:33:26.600
<v Speaker 8>range.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Eighty percent range</v>

1972
01:33:27.010 --> 01:33:29.320
<v Speaker 7>that that would.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Would that make him a murderer?</v>

1973
01:33:29.321 --> 01:33:32.470
<v Speaker 7>Like is it safe to say when you're using</v>
<v Speaker 7>adjectives for him,</v>

1974
01:33:32.471 --> 01:33:35.050
<v Speaker 7>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well he has.</v>

1975
01:33:35.170 --> 01:33:37.140
<v Speaker 7>Could you say he has murdered?</v>

1976
01:33:37.450 --> 01:33:38.780
<v Speaker 8>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Could you say this?</v>

1977
01:33:38.781 --> 01:33:39.614
<v Speaker 8>That we have an infant tile view of what</v>
<v Speaker 8>the president is because there are so </v>

1978
01:33:42.921 --> 01:33:43.754
<v Speaker 8>many tasks in so many human beings in so</v>
<v Speaker 8>many things that are connected to him </v>

1979
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:48.403
<v Speaker 8>that the idea that he is the one giving </v>
<v Speaker 8>all the orders for all these different </v>

1980
01:33:51.321 --> 01:33:54.200
<v Speaker 8>things that are happening all over the </v>
<v Speaker 8>world is kind of absurd.</v>

1981
01:33:54.710 --> 01:33:57.440
<v Speaker 8>It's like a monotheistic God or the </v>
<v Speaker 8>Daddy.</v>

1982
01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:58.433
<v Speaker 8>We we really need to go to a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a more community based understanding of </v>

1983
01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:03.433
<v Speaker 8>religion and politics of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There shouldn't be one person in charge </v>

1984
01:34:06.531 --> 01:34:07.670
<v Speaker 8>of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's ridiculous.</v>

1985
01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:10.400
<v Speaker 8>One guy just thinking about two massive </v>
<v Speaker 8>issues,</v>

1986
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:15.550
<v Speaker 8>geopolitics and a and finance.</v>
<v Speaker 8>These are two things that the government</v>

1987
01:34:17.511 --> 01:34:18.344
<v Speaker 8>is supposed to have their hands on,</v>
<v Speaker 8>their source to be able to control the </v>

1988
01:34:22.191 --> 01:34:23.024
<v Speaker 8>way we interact with world leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all sorts of weird military </v>

1989
01:34:27.891 --> 01:34:31.730
<v Speaker 8>dictatorships and the Middle East and in</v>
<v Speaker 8>North Korea.</v>

1990
01:34:31.731 --> 01:34:34.190
<v Speaker 8>We have to interact with all of these </v>
<v Speaker 8>countries,</v>

1991
01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.860
<v Speaker 8>hundreds of countries.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then on top of that,</v>

1992
01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:40.260
<v Speaker 8>he's responsible for job growth.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like what?</v>

1993
01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:41.890
<v Speaker 8>Who is this fucking guy?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

1994
01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:43.700
<v Speaker 8>What else is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's ordering Jones trikes.</v>

1995
01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:46.130
<v Speaker 8>He's ordering drone strikes to what else</v>
<v Speaker 8>is doing?</v>

1996
01:34:46.190 --> 01:34:48.680
<v Speaker 8>He's keeping pot illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That son of a bitch,</v>

1997
01:34:48.681 --> 01:34:51.830
<v Speaker 8>he's appointing Supreme Court judges </v>
<v Speaker 8>just drilling in Alaska.</v>

1998
01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:55.490
<v Speaker 8>He's cutting a new road through the </v>
<v Speaker 8>Salmon River like he they're doing.</v>

1999
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 8>He's one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one guy</v>

2000
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:02.390
<v Speaker 6>doing any one guy with a full time job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Doing any one of those.</v>

2001
01:35:02.391 --> 01:35:03.224
<v Speaker 6>Being responsible for the decisions is </v>
<v Speaker 6>crazy for any one of those things are </v>

2002
01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.393
<v Speaker 6>the public face of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you notice a trump and I used to </v>

2003
01:35:11.391 --> 01:35:13.550
<v Speaker 6>think that people were exaggerating,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's losing his shit.</v>

2004
01:35:13.710 --> 01:35:16.180
<v Speaker 6>He's micro strokes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he's.</v>

2005
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:17.083
<v Speaker 6>He's slurring his words now a lot and he</v>
<v Speaker 6>drinks 12 cans of diet coke a day </v>

2006
01:35:21.231 --> 01:35:23.180
<v Speaker 6>apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which made me maybe fake news.</v>

2007
01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:24.800
<v Speaker 6>They might be fucking with this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

2008
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:27.980
<v Speaker 6>but he watches eight hours of television</v>
<v Speaker 6>a day.</v>

2009
01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.380
<v Speaker 6>So perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Representative of America.</v>

2010
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:31.243
<v Speaker 6>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nearly 90 percent of the people killed </v>

2011
01:35:33.381 --> 01:35:36.770
<v Speaker 6>in air strikes were not the intended </v>
<v Speaker 6>targets during one,</v>

2012
01:35:36.771 --> 01:35:41.771
<v Speaker 6>five month period of operation between </v>
<v Speaker 6>January 2012 and February 2013.</v>

2013
01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:45.000
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well why do they hate us?</v>

2014
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:46.140
<v Speaker 7>But why do they hate?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2015
01:35:46.141 --> 01:35:48.450
<v Speaker 7>let's talk about the psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do eat them.</v>

2016
01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:52.710
<v Speaker 7>Let's talk about the psychopath idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like what is a psychopath?</v>

2017
01:35:52.711 --> 01:35:56.610
<v Speaker 7>I mean this is a very special kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of of murder that's happening here.</v>

2018
01:35:56.611 --> 01:35:57.660
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2019
01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.910
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's take the classic example.</v>

2020
01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:00.960
<v Speaker 7>God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Rhett,</v>

2021
01:36:01.110 --> 01:36:03.570
<v Speaker 7>may he rest in peace.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Charles Manson,</v>

2022
01:36:03.810 --> 01:36:06.630
<v Speaker 7>one of the things he always said is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I never killed anybody.</v>

2023
01:36:06.631 --> 01:36:08.280
<v Speaker 7>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I never killed anybody.</v>

2024
01:36:08.281 --> 01:36:09.900
<v Speaker 7>And it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think he ever killed anybody.</v>

2025
01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:13.110
<v Speaker 7>Tex Watson did all the killings.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So in with Manson,</v>

2026
01:36:13.111 --> 01:36:15.180
<v Speaker 7>it's like Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That guy is truly.</v>

2027
01:36:15.181 --> 01:36:17.100
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he really is one of the classics.</v>

2028
01:36:17.101 --> 01:36:19.380
<v Speaker 7>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's like one of the most entertaining,</v>

2029
01:36:19.381 --> 01:36:22.770
<v Speaker 7>entertaining psychopaths in America.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe ever.</v>

2030
01:36:22.771 --> 01:36:25.380
<v Speaker 7>He's really great actor.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's a great musician,</v>

2031
01:36:25.770 --> 01:36:27.180
<v Speaker 7>but he's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But the thing is like,</v>

2032
01:36:27.181 --> 01:36:28.410
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we know Manson.</v>

2033
01:36:28.410 --> 01:36:31.490
<v Speaker 7>That guy was out of his fucking Gore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We age your garbage man.</v>

2034
01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:32.371
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

2035
01:36:32.371 --> 01:36:35.110
<v Speaker 7>You call it garbage dump.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I call it a gold mine,</v>

2036
01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:38.010
<v Speaker 7>but like you take somebody like that and</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

2037
01:36:38.011 --> 01:36:39.210
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>clearly nuts.</v>

2038
01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:44.280
<v Speaker 7>But then you take someone like Obama or </v>
<v Speaker 7>any American president who was killed so</v>

2039
01:36:44.281 --> 01:36:45.114
<v Speaker 7>many more people are ordered people to </v>
<v Speaker 7>kill so many more people in many of </v>

2040
01:36:47.491 --> 01:36:48.324
<v Speaker 7>those people or children and they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>dressed in a suit and there are dapper </v>

2041
01:36:52.770 --> 01:36:54.390
<v Speaker 7>and they're fucking charismatic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2042
01:36:54.391 --> 01:36:56.490
<v Speaker 7>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If Obama walked into the room right now,</v>

2043
01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:57.810
<v Speaker 7>I do like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wow,</v>

2044

2046
01:37:00.930 --> 01:37:04.230
<v Speaker 6>You know how you know how a drone </v>
<v Speaker 6>strikes get approved now,</v>

2047
01:37:04.231 --> 01:37:08.610
<v Speaker 6>lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what from the Defense Department?</v>

2048
01:37:08.670 --> 01:37:11.070
<v Speaker 6>Lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>lawyers ultimately make the call whether</v>

2049
01:37:11.071 --> 01:37:13.420
<v Speaker 6>or not drone strikes get approved,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but dude,</v>

2050
01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:15.140
<v Speaker 6>they get together with lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the.</v>

2051
01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.153
<v Speaker 6>That's the day they have a target.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Say of the targets and apartment </v>

2052
01:37:19.411 --> 01:37:22.140
<v Speaker 6>building,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have a Geo locator on the target,</v>

2053
01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:23.013
<v Speaker 6>like whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's a metadata from someone's </v>

<v Speaker 6>cell phone that indicates the cell </v>
<v Speaker 6>phones in this particular area,</v>

2055
01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:31.860
<v Speaker 6>how big of a target is this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How much of a risk is it?</v>

2056
01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:33.790
<v Speaker 6>What's the benefits of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they'll,</v>

2057
01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:35.310
<v Speaker 6>they'll literally get together with </v>
<v Speaker 6>lawyers.</v>

2058
01:37:35.311 --> 01:37:38.220
<v Speaker 6>This is according to a guy that I know </v>
<v Speaker 6>that used to be one of the big wigs,</v>

2059
01:37:38.221 --> 01:37:39.870
<v Speaker 6>the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

2060
01:37:39.871 --> 01:37:41.820
<v Speaker 6>this is what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mike Baker told me that.</v>

2061
01:37:41.850 --> 01:37:42.683
<v Speaker 6>Are they worried about getting sued or </v>
<v Speaker 6>what they're worried about the legality </v>

2062
01:37:45.511 --> 01:37:47.310
<v Speaker 6>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how it's going to be perceived,</v>

2063
01:37:47.311 --> 01:37:50.070
<v Speaker 6>whether or not you can be tried as a war</v>
<v Speaker 6>criminal for this.</v>

2064
01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:51.270
<v Speaker 6>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2065
01:37:51.271 --> 01:37:56.271
<v Speaker 6>Like it's not just the scary thing is </v>
<v Speaker 6>not just that 90 are unintended targets.</v>

2066
01:37:56.851 --> 01:37:57.684
<v Speaker 6>It's that they know going in that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're going to kill a bunch of </v>

2067
01:38:00.991 --> 01:38:01.824
<v Speaker 6>unintended gun him down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you saw that collateral murder </v>

2068
01:38:05.521 --> 01:38:07.800
<v Speaker 6>video,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is what put what wiki leaks on the</v>

2069
01:38:07.801 --> 01:38:12.801
<v Speaker 6>map when they released that video that </v>
<v Speaker 6>showed those guys gunning down and uh,</v>

2070
01:38:13.981 --> 01:38:14.814
<v Speaker 6>there was a minivan and these kids in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the van and let the guys literal </v>

2071
01:38:17.761 --> 01:38:19.470
<v Speaker 6>reaction is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I shouldn't have brought the kids,</v>

2072
01:38:20.610 --> 01:38:22.380
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't have brought the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We had a gun.</v>

2073
01:38:22.381 --> 01:38:23.310
<v Speaker 6>You down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2074
01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:24.840
<v Speaker 6>whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Turns out that wasn't a gun.</v>

2075
01:38:24.841 --> 01:38:26.670
<v Speaker 6>It was a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My bad.</v>

2076
01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:30.030
<v Speaker 6>I mean they're gunning you down with </v>
<v Speaker 6>blurry images from the sky.</v>

2077
01:38:30.330 --> 01:38:31.163
<v Speaker 6>And then when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they killed kids or thought they'd </v>

2078
01:38:33.571 --> 01:38:35.280
<v Speaker 6>killed kids,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the kid survived.</v>

2079
01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:37.190
<v Speaker 6>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't have brought the kid.</v>

2080
01:38:37.770 --> 01:38:38.341
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that.</v>

2081
01:38:38.341 --> 01:38:40.940
<v Speaker 7>And that's what's really wild about it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that freedom.</v>

2082
01:38:41.190 --> 01:38:43.620
<v Speaker 7>We don't yet freedom the tree of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 7>liberty.</v>

2083
01:38:43.621 --> 01:38:45.670
<v Speaker 7>We got to water.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What do you want the thing to weather.</v>

2084
01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.870
<v Speaker 7>But this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is that,</v>

2085
01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:50.700
<v Speaker 7>that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is the most interesting thing about</v>

2086
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:51.833
<v Speaker 7>living in the United States is the way </v>
<v Speaker 7>that you generally don't think about </v>

2087
01:38:57.031 --> 01:38:59.670
<v Speaker 7>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you just don't think about it.</v>

2088
01:38:59.671 --> 01:39:01.770
<v Speaker 7>It's not a thing that you really.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What are you going to do?</v>

2089
01:39:01.771 --> 01:39:03.270
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2090
01:39:03.271 --> 01:39:05.010
<v Speaker 7>it's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2091
01:39:05.011 --> 01:39:06.270
<v Speaker 7>we've been doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2092
01:39:06.271 --> 01:39:09.090
<v Speaker 7>we've done it over and over and over and</v>
<v Speaker 7>over and over again,</v>

2093
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:11.820
<v Speaker 7>but really nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What can we do?</v>

2094
01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:13.370
<v Speaker 7>You vote your low,</v>
<v Speaker 7>low,</v>

2095
01:39:13.410 --> 01:39:17.330
<v Speaker 7>be politically active and maybe you can </v>
<v Speaker 7>get somebody in power who isn't going to</v>

2096
01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:20.880
<v Speaker 7>kill a bunch of people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but inevitably they keep killing a bunch</v>

2097
01:39:20.881 --> 01:39:21.714
<v Speaker 7>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They keep doing it and we keep ignoring </v>

2098
01:39:24.211 --> 01:39:29.160
<v Speaker 7>it and that is one of the creepiest </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking things because it's the,</v>

2099
01:39:29.161 --> 01:39:29.940
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>alright,</v>

2100
01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:34.800
<v Speaker 7>when here in the United States when a </v>
<v Speaker 7>cop guns down somebody,</v>

2101
01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:37.530
<v Speaker 7>thank God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>most people freak out.</v>

2102
01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:41.450
<v Speaker 7>Like that video that you tweeted.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We all look at the video.</v>

2103
01:39:41.470 --> 01:39:42.390
<v Speaker 7>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my God,</v>

2104
01:39:42.391 --> 01:39:44.970
<v Speaker 7>how did that guy get off the hook?</v>
<v Speaker 7>We used to look at his picture.</v>

2105
01:39:44.971 --> 01:39:48.510
<v Speaker 7>He's a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but w probably today,</v>

2106
01:39:48.511 --> 01:39:50.610
<v Speaker 7>I don't know for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but this week,</v>

2107
01:39:50.611 --> 01:39:54.720
<v Speaker 7>certainly this month some people got </v>
<v Speaker 7>exploded by the United States.</v>

2108
01:39:54.721 --> 01:39:55.554
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2109
01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:56.593
<v Speaker 6>Does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean this thing about drones is they </v>

2110
01:39:58.761 --> 01:39:59.594
<v Speaker 6>don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't tell you we're launching </v>

2111
01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:02.440
<v Speaker 6>drones</v>

2112
01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:03.273
<v Speaker 3>strikes and then like let's talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Yemen where all the weapons that Saudi </v>

2113
01:40:08.170 --> 01:40:09.003
<v Speaker 3>Arabia is using to starve and destroy </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Yemeni population came from the </v>

2114
01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:14.440
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

2115
01:40:14.490 --> 01:40:19.300
<v Speaker 3>And the pilots are trained by us and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got our drones blowing people up,</v>

2116
01:40:19.301 --> 01:40:20.134
<v Speaker 3>but also we've totally armed this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country that's destroying this other </v>

2117
01:40:22.781 --> 01:40:24.940
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do you know,</v>

2118
01:40:24.941 --> 01:40:27.910
<v Speaker 3>they know that it says USA on the bomb </v>
<v Speaker 3>fragments.</v>

2119
01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.190
<v Speaker 3>That's so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2120
01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:31.980
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

2121
01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:33.580
<v Speaker 3>Sorry to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2122
01:40:33.650 --> 01:40:35.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if this will derail it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2123
01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:39.280
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about Sam Harris earlier </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Bfi have a.</v>

2124
01:40:39.290 --> 01:40:40.123
<v Speaker 3>it's not a beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the disagreement that I have with </v>

2125
01:40:41.781 --> 01:40:46.781
<v Speaker 3>him around his Islam thing is that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>totally discounts the role of US foreign</v>

2126
01:40:47.871 --> 01:40:52.871
<v Speaker 3>policy in creating the toxic environment</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gives rise to things like isis.</v>

2127
01:40:54.670 --> 01:40:58.030
<v Speaker 3>So to ensure that he totally discount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because I don't think that's true.</v>

2128
01:40:58.210 --> 01:40:59.290
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2129
01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:00.393
<v Speaker 3>you know a lot more about Sam than I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some of my friends and listeners </v>

2130
01:41:04.091 --> 01:41:04.811
<v Speaker 3>will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2131
01:41:04.811 --> 01:41:07.780
<v Speaker 3>you got to listen to convenient talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

2132
01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:08.853
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listen to one podcast he did where he </v>

2133
01:41:11.651 --> 01:41:16.651
<v Speaker 3>was responding to this article in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2134
01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:21.220
<v Speaker 3>the publication of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Islamic Jihad or something,</v>

2135
01:41:21.221 --> 01:41:22.054
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2136
01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:23.740
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm talking about.</v>

2137
01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:25.080
<v Speaker 3>Like all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2138
01:41:25.081 --> 01:41:28.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm a non Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be killed and blah,</v>

2139
01:41:28.751 --> 01:41:29.584
<v Speaker 3>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's going through this whole thing </v>

2140
01:41:30.501 --> 01:41:32.680
<v Speaker 3>and it's been a year since I listened to</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2141
01:41:32.681 --> 01:41:33.514
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apologies to Sam if I'm misremembering </v>

2142
01:41:36.161 --> 01:41:38.170
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I remember thinking at the time</v>

2143
01:41:38.171 --> 01:41:40.780
<v Speaker 3>was he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said something like,</v>

2144
01:41:40.781 --> 01:41:41.614
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are people who think that it's US </v>

2145
01:41:42.401 --> 01:41:43.810
<v Speaker 3>foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's ridiculous.</v>

2146
01:41:43.811 --> 01:41:45.400
<v Speaker 3>This is Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is Islam.</v>

2147
01:41:45.401 --> 01:41:48.850
<v Speaker 3>It says it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the ideology of Islam.</v>

2148
01:41:48.851 --> 01:41:49.391
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2149
01:41:49.391 --> 01:41:50.224
<v Speaker 3>but dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that particular ideology of Islam is </v>

2150
01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:57.790
<v Speaker 3>taking hold a because of 100 years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign policy of,</v>

2151
01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:00.670
<v Speaker 3>of humiliating and destroying these </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultures,</v>

2152
01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:01.713
<v Speaker 3>and B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of American support for the </v>

2153
01:42:05.050 --> 01:42:05.883
<v Speaker 3>Saudi supported a schools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot the name of the schools that </v>

2154
01:42:10.570 --> 01:42:13.840
<v Speaker 3>are all over the Middle East now because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Saudi Arabia,</v>

2155
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:16.510
<v Speaker 3>putting them into Pakistan and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan and all that.</v>

2156
01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:19.210
<v Speaker 3>That will hobby ism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2157
01:42:19.211 --> 01:42:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2158
01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:21.634
<v Speaker 3>so I mean I think this is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>important that when you destroy </v>

2159
01:42:25.690 --> 01:42:27.970
<v Speaker 3>countries and when you do it the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing it,</v>

2160
01:42:27.971 --> 01:42:30.370
<v Speaker 3>we don't even have the balls to go in on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground.</v>

2161
01:42:30.910 --> 01:42:33.340
<v Speaker 3>You're just blasting people from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>clouds.</v>

2162
01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:34.593
<v Speaker 3>It creates blowback and if that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressed in terms of a religious </v>

2163
01:42:38.531 --> 01:42:41.890
<v Speaker 3>ideology or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to come back do.</v>

2164
01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:42.793
<v Speaker 3>You're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's also stuff that's happening </v>

2165
01:42:45.251 --> 01:42:47.380
<v Speaker 3>to places that it has nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

2166
01:42:47.381 --> 01:42:48.214
<v Speaker 3>That's also related to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean look at what's going on in Iraq </v>

2167
01:42:51.851 --> 01:42:52.684
<v Speaker 3>when the power vacuum was created </v>
<v Speaker 3>because Saddam Hussein was killed and </v>

2168
01:42:56.351 --> 01:42:59.180
<v Speaker 3>the Sunni's and this year I started a </v>
<v Speaker 3>civil war and they're,</v>

2169
01:42:59.181 --> 01:42:59.551
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2170
01:42:59.551 --> 01:43:02.550
<v Speaker 3>they're starting a war that has nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do with America again,</v>

2171
01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:06.190
<v Speaker 3>and the fact that America took out their</v>
<v Speaker 3>dictator,</v>

2172
01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:07.780
<v Speaker 3>but why does it exist?</v>

2173
01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:12.610
<v Speaker 3>Who created Iraq?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did the British and we created it and</v>

2174
01:43:12.611 --> 01:43:14.620
<v Speaker 3>we created it like we did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I say we,</v>

2175
01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:17.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about European know post </v>
<v Speaker 3>World War II team,</v>

2176
01:43:17.651 --> 01:43:19.660
<v Speaker 3>US principal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>World War One.</v>

2177
01:43:19.661 --> 01:43:20.261
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2178
01:43:20.261 --> 01:43:21.094
<v Speaker 3>Team us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they created these countries in </v>

2179
01:43:23.051 --> 01:43:23.884
<v Speaker 3>Africa as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they intentionally created them so that </v>

2180
01:43:26.171 --> 01:43:27.004
<v Speaker 3>there were opposing tribes or </v>
<v Speaker 3>populations within the country so that </v>

2181
01:43:30.311 --> 01:43:32.230
<v Speaker 3>they could better exercise control over </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2182
01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:35.740
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they engineered the Sunni and Shiite.</v>

2183
01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:38.260
<v Speaker 3>They engineered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at the origins of,</v>

2184
01:43:38.290 --> 01:43:39.550
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not an expert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

2185
01:43:39.551 --> 01:43:40.384
<v Speaker 3>I've read this several different places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know it happened in in Africa as </v>

2186
01:43:43.721 --> 01:43:44.554
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they would intentionally draw the </v>

2187
01:43:45.461 --> 01:43:49.720
<v Speaker 3>borders so that you have different </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribes within that border who are all.</v>

2188
01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:50.613
<v Speaker 3>You have a long lasting and enmity with </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other so you can like arm and can </v>

2189
01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.000
<v Speaker 3>manipulate one tribe to dominate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>

2190
01:43:59.330 --> 01:44:01.950
<v Speaker 3>And then when dee colonialization </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>

2191
01:44:01.951 --> 01:44:02.784
<v Speaker 3>then we and we have all these unstable </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures in place that we've left </v>

2192
01:44:07.251 --> 01:44:08.780
<v Speaker 3>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what you're asking</v>

2193
01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:09.653
<v Speaker 6>lighting is that it's a very complex </v>
<v Speaker 6>issue and it's not simply just the </v>

2194
01:44:13.051 --> 01:44:13.884
<v Speaker 6>ideology and I 100 percent agree.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think anybody who's reasonable </v>

2195
01:44:16.890 --> 01:44:17.723
<v Speaker 6>couldn't agree,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I also think that there's a problem </v>

2196
01:44:19.531 --> 01:44:20.364
<v Speaker 6>with human psychology and ideologies and</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we have this very bizarre desire to </v>

2197
01:44:26.041 --> 01:44:26.874
<v Speaker 6>be all in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in whatever team that were on and when </v>

2198
01:44:29.851 --> 01:44:34.851
<v Speaker 6>you're on a team that has in arguably in</v>
<v Speaker 6>2017,</v>

2199
01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:39.210
<v Speaker 6>the most archaic mainstream ideology </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

2200
01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:40.470
<v Speaker 6>that's Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2201
01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:45.500
<v Speaker 6>I mean if you stop and think about how </v>
<v Speaker 6>ancient is it in its practices the way,</v>

2202
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:48.960
<v Speaker 6>especially when it's in use in radical </v>
<v Speaker 6>ways,</v>

2203
01:44:48.961 --> 01:44:52.050
<v Speaker 6>the way women are forced to dress the </v>
<v Speaker 6>way in Saudi Arabia,</v>

2204
01:44:52.051 --> 01:44:54.420
<v Speaker 6>I think up until really recently they </v>
<v Speaker 6>weren't allowed to drive.</v>

2205
01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:57.000
<v Speaker 6>Right now they're allowing them to </v>
<v Speaker 6>within the last two or three years,</v>

2206
01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:58.313
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of like stuff in it that </v>
<v Speaker 6>we would think of as being a part of a </v>

2207
01:45:01.921 --> 01:45:05.160
<v Speaker 6>bygone era of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So for Alabama,</v>

2208
01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:08.190
<v Speaker 6>Roy Moore's losing though apparently is </v>
<v Speaker 6>he?</v>

2209
01:45:08.250 --> 01:45:09.083
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's happening right down by 10 </v>

2210
01:45:10.051 --> 01:45:10.884
<v Speaker 6>points.</v>

2211
01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:16.140
<v Speaker 6>Is paralyzed right on that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2212
01:45:16.141 --> 01:45:18.020
<v Speaker 6>There's definitely parallels.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>

2213
01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:18.863
<v Speaker 6>I think it's like all things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're always looking for one reason why </v>

2214
01:45:21.871 --> 01:45:22.704
<v Speaker 6>something exists and look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the reason why you have this idea of </v>

2215
01:45:27.301 --> 01:45:32.301
<v Speaker 6>jihad and jihadism being like involving </v>
<v Speaker 6>suicide bombers and sacrifice and wore a</v>

2216
01:45:34.891 --> 01:45:35.724
<v Speaker 6>lot of that is direct directly </v>
<v Speaker 6>attributable to what happened to </v>

2217
01:45:39.301 --> 01:45:40.134
<v Speaker 6>Afghanistan during the Soviet Union's </v>
<v Speaker 6>interaction with them when we were </v>

2218
01:45:43.051 --> 01:45:45.690
<v Speaker 6>training the Muja hi dean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you don't,</v>

2219
01:45:46.050 --> 01:45:46.883
<v Speaker 6>the way they talked people into going to</v>
<v Speaker 6>war and arm them against the Soviet </v>

2220
01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:52.980
<v Speaker 6>Union.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These few tile attempts.</v>

2221
01:45:53.010 --> 01:45:55.560
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a lot of like this.</v>

2222
01:45:55.561 --> 01:45:58.920
<v Speaker 6>A lot of encouragement for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>these suicidal tactics.</v>

2223
01:45:59.080 --> 01:45:59.913
<v Speaker 6>Maybe not necessarily suicide bombing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the mujahideen were armed directly </v>

2224
01:46:04.801 --> 01:46:09.801
<v Speaker 6>by the United States and that is what </v>
<v Speaker 6>turned Osama bin Ladin against us.</v>

2225
01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:11.340
<v Speaker 6>Like he was with us.</v>

2226
01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:13.740
<v Speaker 3>Charlie Wilson's war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You seen that movie?</v>

2227
01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:14.910
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about that.</v>

2228
01:46:14.911 --> 01:46:15.744
<v Speaker 3>It's about the senator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was who went to Pakistan and </v>

2229
01:46:18.151 --> 01:46:21.450
<v Speaker 3>oversaw the arming of the Mujahideen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Hanks.</v>

2230
01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:22.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2231
01:46:22.410 --> 01:46:27.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone says I look like a while ago.</v>

2232
01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:30.290
<v Speaker 3>Philip Seymour Hoffman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is his name,</v>

2233
01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:31.283
<v Speaker 3>feel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seymour Hoffman and also to relate back </v>

2234
01:46:34.201 --> 01:46:35.034
<v Speaker 3>to what we were talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about the role of sexual </v>

2235
01:46:36.661 --> 01:46:41.260
<v Speaker 3>frustration in getting a martyr's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2236
01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:42.990
<v Speaker 3>these are guys who never get laid.</v>

2237
01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:44.320
<v Speaker 6>A lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These kids,</v>

2238
01:46:44.321 --> 01:46:45.154
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a buddy of mine who was over in </v>

2239
01:46:46.301 --> 01:46:49.030
<v Speaker 6>Afghanistan was telling me how they </v>
<v Speaker 6>would put kids in front of</v>

2240
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.490
<v Speaker 1>because tractors weren't expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2241
01:46:52.530 --> 01:46:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

2242
01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Shawn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2243
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Does doesn't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Baker wasn't.</v>

2244
01:46:56.820 --> 01:46:58.770
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm andy.</v>

2245
01:46:59.010 --> 01:47:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm stumped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

2246
01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:01.103
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Sean Baker was telling me</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was over in Afghanistan as a </v>

2247
01:47:03.931 --> 01:47:06.180
<v Speaker 1>medic and he was saying that these guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>

2248
01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:07.740
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can always make another son.</v>

2249
01:47:07.741 --> 01:47:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I can't get another tractor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus God.</v>

2250
01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:13.530
<v Speaker 1>So the other kids walk in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tractors to look for landmines.</v>

2251
01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:15.900
<v Speaker 1>D,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does,</v>

2252
01:47:15.901 --> 01:47:18.540
<v Speaker 1>here's the super bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The donkeys have blown up or any.</v>

2253
01:47:18.541 --> 01:47:19.374
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could even be something that </v>

2254
01:47:21.391 --> 01:47:22.224
<v Speaker 1>someone could say and you realized the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in the world that you'll in </v>

2255
01:47:25.081 --> 01:47:29.260
<v Speaker 1>the harshness of the world that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about and the worst thing.</v>

2256
01:47:29.470 --> 01:47:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst thing about Afghanistan is,</v>

2257
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:33.623
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know a lot old hippy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so used to that was on the hippie trail </v>

2258
01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:40.380
<v Speaker 1>and Afghanistan was the best place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody loved Afghanistan.</v>

2259
01:47:40.381 --> 01:47:43.590
<v Speaker 1>The people are so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So welcoming your,</v>

2260
01:47:43.650 --> 01:47:45.720
<v Speaker 1>your bus breaks down in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nowhere.</v>

2261
01:47:45.721 --> 01:47:46.554
<v Speaker 1>People will come from miles away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the village and take you back to the </v>

2262
01:47:49.771 --> 01:47:50.604
<v Speaker 1>village and feed you and take care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and like it was the most hospitable </v>

2263

2273
01:48:13.781 --> 01:48:14.614
<v Speaker 7>in India.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The fucking brotherhood of eternal love </v>

2274
01:48:17.051 --> 01:48:20.980
<v Speaker 7>was like just just dispensing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just acid.</v>

<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2283
01:48:42.510 --> 01:48:43.720
<v Speaker 7>the full garb.</v>

2284
01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:48.070
<v Speaker 7>They had swords in one of the hippies </v>
<v Speaker 7>said to them something like,</v>

2285
01:48:48.071 --> 01:48:51.670
<v Speaker 7>we're all children of God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and he responded,</v>

2286
01:48:52.930 --> 01:48:53.763
<v Speaker 7>my God has no children.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was like some kind of heavy duty is </v>

2287
01:48:57.821 --> 01:48:58.541
<v Speaker 7>law.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm just like,</v>

2288
01:48:58.541 --> 01:49:00.760
<v Speaker 7>fuck you hippie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What are you talking about?</v>

2289
01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:02.020
<v Speaker 7>So it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't.</v>

2290
01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:03.053
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everything wasn't necessarily peaceful </v>

2291
01:49:05.381 --> 01:49:08.620
<v Speaker 7>and joyful over there with still </v>
<v Speaker 7>fundamentalism happening there.</v>

2292
01:49:08.621 --> 01:49:10.660
<v Speaker 7>But I think all this shit we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 7>about,</v>

2293
01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:15.100
<v Speaker 7>they're really creepy thing is that </v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever this is,</v>

2294
01:49:15.130 --> 01:49:15.963
<v Speaker 7>whether it's the United States stuck a </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking stick in the ants nest too much </v>

2295
01:49:19.810 --> 01:49:20.643
<v Speaker 7>and now we've got like these </v>
<v Speaker 7>fundamentalists lunatics who will blow </v>

2296
01:49:24.401 --> 01:49:27.410
<v Speaker 7>themselves up to kill other people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

2297
01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:28.453
<v Speaker 7>whether we've got a viral form of a </v>
<v Speaker 7>religion that is infected people's </v>

2298
01:49:33.101 --> 01:49:38.101
<v Speaker 7>brains and is now like a contained is </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to spread with adversity.</v>

2299
01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:39.573
<v Speaker 7>Their real problem is we're also dealing</v>
<v Speaker 7>with an exponential increase in </v>

2300
01:49:42.970 --> 01:49:43.803
<v Speaker 7>technological progress and this is when </v>
<v Speaker 7>I interviewed this Guy Aaron Frank from </v>

2301
01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:48.393
<v Speaker 7>university and is a scary thing he said </v>
<v Speaker 7>is eventually there's going to be </v>

2302
01:49:51.161 --> 01:49:51.994
<v Speaker 7>technology that exists where you can </v>
<v Speaker 7>just like you can engineer a engineer </v>

2303
01:49:57.431 --> 01:50:01.310
<v Speaker 7>fucking ebola using some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 7>biological three d printer when,</v>

2304
01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:03.460
<v Speaker 7>when that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that might be 50 years from now,</v>

2305
01:50:03.461 --> 01:50:04.750
<v Speaker 7>60 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>

2306
01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:06.490
<v Speaker 7>but it's not that far away.</v>

2307
01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:11.820
<v Speaker 7>And also this fucking Cuban sound beam </v>
<v Speaker 7>right there.</v>

2308
01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:12.773
<v Speaker 7>There's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2309
01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:15.880
<v Speaker 7>the story popped up about these people </v>
<v Speaker 7>in Cuba state.</v>

2310
01:50:15.881 --> 01:50:19.210
<v Speaker 7>There's some weird chirping sound.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The embassy at the embassy,</v>

2311
01:50:19.211 --> 01:50:20.044
<v Speaker 7>US embassy there shooting some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 7>sound weapon at them and driving them </v>

2312
01:50:23.771 --> 01:50:24.604
<v Speaker 7>crazy and it caused brain damage and so </v>
<v Speaker 7>when you consider that already there is </v>

2313
01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:29.493
<v Speaker 7>apparently some new sonic weapon </v>
<v Speaker 7>existing that can make you mentally </v>

2314
01:50:33.281 --> 01:50:34.114
<v Speaker 7>disabled maybe permanently.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And we're dealing with people who are </v>

2315
01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:40.660
<v Speaker 7>mentally disabled.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And another fucking way,</v>

2316
01:50:40.661 --> 01:50:45.661
<v Speaker 7>which is that they become infected with </v>
<v Speaker 7>some paradigm that makes them think that</v>

2317
01:50:46.511 --> 01:50:51.490
<v Speaker 7>there is an actual,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like loony God out there that wants them</v>

2318
01:50:51.491 --> 01:50:56.491
<v Speaker 7>to put babies in front of tractors and </v>
<v Speaker 7>that wants them to explode other people.</v>

2319
01:50:56.680 --> 01:50:57.513
<v Speaker 7>And they could maybe get ahold of this </v>
<v Speaker 7>sound beam that goes through walls and </v>

2320
01:51:02.051 --> 01:51:04.720
<v Speaker 7>just start launching it into people's </v>
<v Speaker 7>house through walls.</v>

2321
01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:06.100
<v Speaker 7>I think it went through a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2322
01:51:06.110 --> 01:51:08.890
<v Speaker 7>So they haven't defined what this weapon</v>
<v Speaker 7>is specifically,</v>

2323
01:51:08.891 --> 01:51:10.030
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>This isn't a new thing.</v>

2324
01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:10.930
<v Speaker 7>Well this is the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2325
01:51:10.931 --> 01:51:13.510
<v Speaker 7>have some sound weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some salad.</v>

2326
01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:16.060
<v Speaker 7>But this is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was a time when a nuclear bomb did</v>

2327
01:51:16.061 --> 01:51:19.780
<v Speaker 7>not exist and then it existed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was a time when a gun didn't exist</v>

2328
01:51:19.781 --> 01:51:20.614
<v Speaker 7>and then it existed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I think it'd be a safe bet to say in </v>

2329
01:51:22.541 --> 01:51:26.530
<v Speaker 7>the next 50 years we're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 7>some brand new fucking weapon.</v>

2330
01:51:26.710 --> 01:51:29.950
<v Speaker 7>There's some guy in Darpa right now </v>
<v Speaker 7>whipping up some fucking thing.</v>

2331
01:51:29.951 --> 01:51:31.900
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So who knows what it is,</v>

2332
01:51:31.901 --> 01:51:32.980
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just like,</v>

2333
01:51:32.981 --> 01:51:33.814
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a new kind of flashlight that shines </v>

2334
01:51:35.591 --> 01:51:38.770
<v Speaker 7>through walls.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And just makes you forget who you are,</v>

2335
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:42.010
<v Speaker 7>why you saw what Elon Musk said about </v>
<v Speaker 7>the robots.</v>

2336
01:51:42.250 --> 01:51:43.083
<v Speaker 7>You need a strobe light to see him </v>
<v Speaker 7>because there'll be moving so fast in </v>

2337
01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:46.160
<v Speaker 7>two years.</v>

2338
01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:47.530
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sleep tight,</v>

2339
01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:49.780
<v Speaker 7>sleep tight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because it's like,</v>

2340
01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:50.703
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not only do we have like these weapons </v>

2341
01:51:52.871 --> 01:51:54.850
<v Speaker 7>are in the hands right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you said,</v>

2342
01:51:55.190 --> 01:51:58.960
<v Speaker 7>the nuclear weapons are in the hands of </v>
<v Speaker 7>somebody won a popularity contest.</v>

2343
01:51:59.410 --> 01:52:01.510
<v Speaker 7>I don't know who's gonna control the </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking robots,</v>

2344
01:52:01.511 --> 01:52:03.040
<v Speaker 7>but one thing's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

2345
01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:04.173
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of crazy people on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>planet right now and they're going to </v>

2346
01:52:07.391 --> 01:52:10.650
<v Speaker 7>have access to shit unlike anything </v>
<v Speaker 7>we've ever,</v>

2347
01:52:10.690 --> 01:52:13.270
<v Speaker 7>we've ever seen in the question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

2348
01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:15.760
<v Speaker 7>And how about a weapon that just makes </v>
<v Speaker 7>everyone.</v>

2349
01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:19.780
<v Speaker 7>Infant tile doesn't kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like the idea of the hydrogen bomb,</v>

2350
01:52:21.330 --> 01:52:22.730
<v Speaker 7>the hydrogen bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2351
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:25.150
<v Speaker 7>That kills all the people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Leaves.</v>

2352
01:52:25.151 --> 01:52:27.880
<v Speaker 7>All the buildings are beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But what about neutron bomb?</v>

2353
01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:29.650
<v Speaker 7>Neutrons that what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're right.</v>

2354
01:52:30.430 --> 01:52:32.450
<v Speaker 7>What about stupid bomb?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2355
01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:34.960
<v Speaker 7>like a bomb that makes everybody have a </v>
<v Speaker 7>50 Iq.</v>

2356
01:52:34.990 --> 01:52:37.540
<v Speaker 7>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They thought they would drop a LSD,</v>

2357
01:52:37.541 --> 01:52:38.374
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>They were experimenting with Lsd in the </v>

2358
01:52:40.151 --> 01:52:44.140
<v Speaker 7>sixties and seventies thinking that they</v>
<v Speaker 7>could use that to make soldiers crazy on</v>

2359
01:52:44.141 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 7>the battlefield,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so he initially wanted to use</v>

2360
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:46.873
<v Speaker 6>it as a truth serum.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They want to use it on captured enemy </v>

2361
01:52:48.651 --> 01:52:49.690
<v Speaker 6>soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2362
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:50.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's.</v>

2363
01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:54.370
<v Speaker 6>There's some hilarious videos from the </v>
<v Speaker 6>19 fifties given soldiers acid,</v>

2364
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:57.280
<v Speaker 6>world war two video.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2365
01:52:57.370 --> 01:53:00.650
<v Speaker 6>We'll post World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They got them all doped up on acid,</v>

2366
01:53:00.651 --> 01:53:01.484
<v Speaker 6>I think their English troops from the UK</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they're wandering around and black </v>

2367
01:53:04.821 --> 01:53:06.470
<v Speaker 6>and white footage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just tripping balls.</v>

2368
01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:07.713
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

2369
01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:09.193
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's true.</v>

2370
01:53:09.250 --> 01:53:10.690
<v Speaker 7>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is the.</v>

2371
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:15.590
<v Speaker 7>This is actually why we need lsd right </v>
<v Speaker 7>now because the problem is we're.</v>

2372
01:53:15.591 --> 01:53:16.424
<v Speaker 7>We're facing one of the most beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 7>things that could ever happen to our </v>

2373
01:53:19.191 --> 01:53:20.024
<v Speaker 7>society,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is we're about to create this </v>

2374
01:53:22.941 --> 01:53:23.774
<v Speaker 7>beautiful technology that is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 7>something unlike anything we've ever </v>

2375
01:53:28.311 --> 01:53:30.320
<v Speaker 7>seen and it's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's wonderful.</v>

2376
01:53:30.321 --> 01:53:32.510
<v Speaker 7>Humans are mostly wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>

2377
01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:36.800
<v Speaker 7>but we've got a few of us out there have</v>
<v Speaker 7>been infected with this thing.</v>

2378
01:53:36.801 --> 01:53:39.810
<v Speaker 7>You're talking about us or them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the team attitude.</v>

2379
01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.903
<v Speaker 7>It's me and you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's me versus you and this is the </v>

2380
01:53:43.581 --> 01:53:44.690
<v Speaker 7>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is the.</v>

2381
01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:47.490
<v Speaker 7>This is a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How do we fix that?</v>

2382
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:48.950
<v Speaker 7>That.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because it's like,</v>

2383
01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:50.900
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know who caused it.</v>

2384
01:53:51.230 --> 01:53:52.063
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like what are is fucking Harvey </v>

2385
01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:55.640
<v Speaker 7>Weinstein or these,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2386
01:53:55.641 --> 01:53:59.570
<v Speaker 7>is it because we did teen teen teen boys</v>
<v Speaker 7>aren't getting jerked off enough.</v>

2387
01:53:59.750 --> 01:54:03.560
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But we do have a problem right now which</v>

2388
01:54:03.561 --> 01:54:08.561
<v Speaker 7>is that there's a lot of people whose </v>
<v Speaker 7>minds are scrambled with crazy ideas and</v>

2389
01:54:09.501 --> 01:54:11.090
<v Speaker 7>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's okay.</v>

2390
01:54:11.091 --> 01:54:11.924
<v Speaker 7>Back when there were crossbows and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but now that we've got these minds </v>

2391
01:54:14.831 --> 01:54:19.831
<v Speaker 7>scramble with crazy ideas and access to </v>
<v Speaker 7>information about how to make fertilizer</v>

2392
01:54:21.051 --> 01:54:23.990
<v Speaker 7>bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how to make the Ivr already heard,</v>

2393
01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:24.350
<v Speaker 7>ever happened.</v>

2394
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:25.183
<v Speaker 6>Then with that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

2395

<v Speaker 3>But you can take a picture with Brian.</v>

2450
01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:11.670
<v Speaker 3>So I got picture with the dog licking my</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheek and Heathrow,</v>

2451
01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:12.973
<v Speaker 3>hilarious.</v>

2452
01:56:13.650 --> 01:56:16.390
<v Speaker 6>Bought a laptop once,</v>
<v Speaker 6>red band and uh,</v>

2453
01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:19.610
<v Speaker 6>he was selling this windows laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want it to get a second laptop.</v>

2454
01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:24.880
<v Speaker 6>And the first time I used it took it </v>
<v Speaker 6>through the airport and uh,</v>

2455
01:56:26.180 --> 01:56:28.280
<v Speaker 6>it got screened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2456
01:56:28.281 --> 01:56:30.230
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they pull you aside.</v>

2457
01:56:30.490 --> 01:56:33.350
<v Speaker 6>We're going to have to check this again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you been near farm?</v>

2458
01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:35.390
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know what that meant back then.</v>

2459
01:56:35.391 --> 01:56:37.730
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know about the fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They checked my hands.</v>

2460
01:56:37.731 --> 01:56:38.564
<v Speaker 6>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They swab the entire laptop and they'll </v>

2461
01:56:40.730 --> 01:56:43.850
<v Speaker 6>test positive for fertilizer and cum </v>
<v Speaker 6>stains.</v>

2462
01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:48.020
<v Speaker 6>It's probably just red bands.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just fucking a computer.</v>

2463
01:56:48.021 --> 01:56:51.200
<v Speaker 6>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they went over it with a fine tooth comb</v>

2464
01:56:51.201 --> 01:56:52.034
<v Speaker 6>with a swab and they went up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had asked me a bunch of questions </v>

2465
01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:56.930
<v Speaker 6>and I'll explain what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a comedian,</v>

2466
01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:58.670
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a host fear factor.</v>

2467
01:56:58.671 --> 01:56:59.301
<v Speaker 6>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2468
01:56:59.301 --> 01:57:00.740
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

2469
01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:02.450
<v Speaker 6>Get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just gave it to me.</v>

2470
01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:05.960
<v Speaker 6>Gave me the laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because they recognized you?</v>

2471
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:07.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because they checked the laptop.</v>

2472
01:57:07.401 --> 01:57:08.720
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said I bought it from a friend.</v>

2473
01:57:08.721 --> 01:57:10.040
<v Speaker 6>This is the work around the farm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>

2474
01:57:10.041 --> 01:57:11.740
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2475
01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:12.883
<v Speaker 6>they just tested it and they swapped it </v>
<v Speaker 6>and whatever the minimal amount of </v>

2476
01:57:16.791 --> 01:57:20.000
<v Speaker 6>nitrogen or that they found on it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which exists in fertilizer,</v>

2477
01:57:20.001 --> 01:57:23.210
<v Speaker 6>but also in bombs somehow or another.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's also,</v>

2478
01:57:23.211 --> 01:57:25.340
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nitrogen is the most common thing in the</v>

2479
01:57:25.341 --> 01:57:27.650
<v Speaker 6>air.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The air's 80 percent nitrogen.</v>

2480
01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:32.780
<v Speaker 6>How they're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What they're getting off of the laptop,</v>

2481
01:57:33.050 --> 01:57:35.600
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why it would test positive </v>
<v Speaker 6>or what have you,</v>

2482
01:57:35.601 --> 01:57:39.170
<v Speaker 6>but it was apparently a minimal amount </v>
<v Speaker 6>in some way,</v>

2483
01:57:39.171 --> 01:57:40.580
<v Speaker 6>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They thought it was okay.</v>

2484
01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:41.573
<v Speaker 3>I thought they were going to turn it on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and check the content and you're going </v>

2485
01:57:43.751 --> 01:57:44.584
<v Speaker 3>to get in trouble for</v>

2486
01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:50.280
<v Speaker 6>writing all the shit that I write down </v>
<v Speaker 6>like the fuck is wrong with your head,</v>

2487
01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:54.510
<v Speaker 6>but like if you worked on a farm and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>got that nitrogen shit all over,</v>

2488
01:57:54.511 --> 01:57:55.344
<v Speaker 6>you feel like you were laying down some </v>
<v Speaker 6>fertilizer and gotten your clothes and </v>

2489
01:57:57.331 --> 01:57:59.340
<v Speaker 6>you went straight to the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not flying anywhere,</v>

2490
01:57:59.341 --> 01:58:00.174
<v Speaker 6>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2491
01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:02.850
<v Speaker 6>They check you and they find that shit </v>
<v Speaker 6>on you.</v>

2492
01:58:03.710 --> 01:58:04.543
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if there's somehow or another it gets </v>

2493
01:58:05.401 --> 01:58:06.234
<v Speaker 6>detected.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's touching your bags or something </v>

2494
01:58:08.581 --> 01:58:09.414
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you're gonna you're going to be in </v>

2495
01:58:10.591 --> 01:58:12.460
<v Speaker 6>for some questioning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2496
01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:13.890
<v Speaker 6>That sucks man.</v>

2497
01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:15.393
<v Speaker 3>So what do you think's gonna happen with</v>
<v Speaker 3>this democratization of weaponry that </v>

2498
01:58:18.971 --> 01:58:19.804
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because sometimes I think he could be a </v>

2499
01:58:21.851 --> 01:58:25.840
<v Speaker 3>good thing if everybody had the capacity</v>
<v Speaker 3>to destroy the planet.</v>

2500
01:58:26.250 --> 01:58:27.610
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good thing.</v>

2501
01:58:27.611 --> 01:58:30.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2502
01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:31.413
<v Speaker 3>that's where we're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we're going to have to kill the </v>

2503
01:58:33.761 --> 01:58:35.780
<v Speaker 3>people that we think would possibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroy</v>

2504
01:58:36.030 --> 01:58:38.540
<v Speaker 6>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then everyone's going to be scared.</v>

2505
01:58:38.630 --> 01:58:41.300
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be like mccarthyism for </v>
<v Speaker 6>nuclear catastrophe.</v>

2506
01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 6>Everyone's</v>

2507
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.930
<v Speaker 2>going to think that metro our </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction,</v>

2508
01:58:44.730 --> 01:58:47.350
<v Speaker 2>which works when one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when both people are saying,</v>

2509
01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:48.513
<v Speaker 2>but when you're dealing with someone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to die and like and like these </v>

2510
01:58:51.341 --> 01:58:52.174
<v Speaker 2>shooters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at what's happening with </v>

2511
01:58:52.931 --> 01:58:54.490
<v Speaker 2>these shooters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the guy in Vegas,</v>

2512
01:58:54.730 --> 01:58:55.563
<v Speaker 2>that's an example of a lunatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting ahold of some technology and </v>

2513
01:58:59.981 --> 01:59:00.814
<v Speaker 2>using that technology to wipe out a shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>ton of people not caring if he's going </v>

2514
01:59:03.801 --> 01:59:04.634
<v Speaker 2>to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if that guy was up there with a </v>

2515
01:59:05.591 --> 01:59:06.424
<v Speaker 2>fucking Cuban sonic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumdum beam just blasting people with </v>

2516
01:59:10.631 --> 01:59:13.930
<v Speaker 2>this beam that's making them for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of their lives,</v>

2517
01:59:14.020 --> 01:59:16.750
<v Speaker 2>have some kind of neurological </v>
<v Speaker 2>impairment.</v>

2518
01:59:16.900 --> 01:59:17.733
<v Speaker 2>What if that person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God forbid he was up there like dusting </v>

2519
01:59:20.021 --> 01:59:23.980
<v Speaker 2>out smallpox that he printed up and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>three d printer.</v>

2520
01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:28.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like the creepy thing about it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris,</v>

2521
01:59:28.651 --> 01:59:31.090
<v Speaker 2>that there is not a solution.</v>

2522
01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:32.253
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're looking at like huge chunks </v>

2523
01:59:36.191 --> 01:59:37.024
<v Speaker 2>of the human population that believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in this insane creator force that </v>

2524
01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:45.220
<v Speaker 2>actually wants them to explode </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

2525
01:59:45.490 --> 01:59:46.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went in and like that,</v>

2526
01:59:47.070 --> 01:59:47.903
<v Speaker 2>that shooting that just happened where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the isis came in and just fucking </v>

2527
01:59:51.401 --> 01:59:53.290
<v Speaker 2>executed a bunch of Sufi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2528
01:59:53.730 --> 01:59:56.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Egypt and Sufi Islam.</v>

2529
01:59:56.201 --> 01:59:57.220
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2530
01:59:57.550 --> 01:59:58.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a,</v>

2531
01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:01.300
<v Speaker 2>it's like mystical Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>

2532
02:00:01.330 --> 02:00:03.580
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2533
02:00:03.581 --> 02:00:07.510
<v Speaker 2>It's dancing and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we already have this kind of insanity</v>

2534
02:00:07.511 --> 02:00:09.970
<v Speaker 2>bubbling up in different parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

2535
02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:12.370
<v Speaker 2>So in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have white,</v>

2536
02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:13.233
<v Speaker 2>the loner person who just for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason decides to go and shoot up a </v>

2537
02:00:15.401 --> 02:00:18.340
<v Speaker 2>church or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all like Sam Harris arguments.</v>

2538
02:00:18.830 --> 02:00:19.663
<v Speaker 2>This is Sam Harris believes in when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to like ideologies being </v>

2539
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:25.440
<v Speaker 2>incredibly toxic in that form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2540
02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:26.830
<v Speaker 2>They can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can be.</v>

2541
02:00:26.890 --> 02:00:27.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can be.</v>

2542
02:00:27.851 --> 02:00:30.400
<v Speaker 2>I want to start a fight with Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like him.</v>

2543
02:00:30.401 --> 02:00:35.240
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a fun thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get you a few of your.</v>

2544
02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:36.753
<v Speaker 2>Hey Mr.</v>

2545
02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:39.953
<v Speaker 2>logical focus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get you for your focus being right </v>

2546
02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:45.960
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2547
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:46.420
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2548
02:00:46.420 --> 02:00:47.350
<v Speaker 2>but the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

2549
02:00:47.351 --> 02:00:49.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like a,</v>

2550
02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:51.253
<v Speaker 2>this is ai is a big problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the fact that the current ai </v>

2551
02:00:55.451 --> 02:00:56.284
<v Speaker 2>that we're running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human operating system is like </v>

2552
02:00:58.541 --> 02:01:01.390
<v Speaker 2>already fucking up in this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intense way.</v>

2553
02:01:01.730 --> 02:01:02.441
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

2554
02:01:02.441 --> 02:01:05.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the solution is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one can really even think about it,</v>

2555
02:01:05.411 --> 02:01:06.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is going.</v>

2556
02:01:06.970 --> 02:01:10.180
<v Speaker 2>It's a problem in the most intense way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2557
02:01:10.181 --> 02:01:11.014
<v Speaker 2>here's how easy the ais to hack Donald </v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump who's never been religious at any </v>

2558
02:01:14.111 --> 02:01:17.350
<v Speaker 2>point in his life ever now is able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2559
02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:18.393
<v Speaker 2>God bless America and everybody starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>clapping and they believe that he </v>

2560
02:01:22.961 --> 02:01:25.780
<v Speaker 2>believes that God is blessing of </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

2561
02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:27.940
<v Speaker 2>which has never been a part of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought process.</v>

2562
02:01:27.941 --> 02:01:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2563
02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a giant history of Donald </v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump interacting with the world.</v>

2564
02:01:33.670 --> 02:01:36.100
<v Speaker 2>Never were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there any proselytizing,</v>

2565
02:01:36.230 --> 02:01:37.063
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's never any espousing or have any </v>

2566
02:01:38.930 --> 02:01:40.400
<v Speaker 2>religious doctrines</v>

2567
02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:42.800
<v Speaker 6>are talking about the greatness of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Christianity.</v>

2568
02:01:42.801 --> 02:01:43.634
<v Speaker 6>But now he does it and because he's in </v>
<v Speaker 6>this position where you have to believe </v>

2569
02:01:46.101 --> 02:01:46.934
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We accept that new variation in his </v>

2570
02:01:48.651 --> 02:01:51.050
<v Speaker 6>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the now he brings God into the equation.</v>

2571
02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:53.240
<v Speaker 6>We never brought God into the equation </v>
<v Speaker 6>before.</v>

2572
02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:54.470
<v Speaker 7>That's so creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2573
02:01:54.471 --> 02:01:55.304
<v Speaker 7>The way you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't know what you're talking about </v>

2574
02:01:56.130 --> 02:01:58.310
<v Speaker 7>because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>trump definitely didn't hack any fucking</v>

2575
02:01:58.311 --> 02:01:59.810
<v Speaker 7>ai,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but now I hear what you're saying.</v>

2576
02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:00.673
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2577
02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:01.793
<v Speaker 6>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's tapped into this human ai acquire </v>

2578
02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:09.360
<v Speaker 6>their requirement to believe in </v>
<v Speaker 6>supernatural beings that are looking out</v>

2579
02:02:09.361 --> 02:02:12.690
<v Speaker 6>for us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a requirement in 2017.</v>

2580
02:02:12.691 --> 02:02:13.524
<v Speaker 6>You cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if Chris Ryan wanted to run for </v>

2581
02:02:14.851 --> 02:02:16.520
<v Speaker 6>president,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the real issues,</v>

2582
02:02:16.521 --> 02:02:19.470
<v Speaker 6>it would be as I can't trust an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2583
02:02:20.350 --> 02:02:23.130
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's gonna be the least.</v>

2584
02:02:25.210 --> 02:02:26.043
<v Speaker 6>I just read your book.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We got to sit down and talk is I'm not </v>

2585
02:02:28.621 --> 02:02:29.454
<v Speaker 6>some crazy polygamous monkey person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Be My first press conference would be a </v>

2586
02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:33.880
<v Speaker 6>doozy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let me tell you.</v>

2587
02:02:33.881 --> 02:02:34.714
<v Speaker 6>You're great.</v>

2588
02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:35.231
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2589
02:02:35.231 --> 02:02:36.670
<v Speaker 7>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that,</v>

2590
02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:40.480
<v Speaker 7>that is the problem is the human ai.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're getting better at hacking it.</v>

2591
02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:42.580
<v Speaker 7>You know that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is.</v>

2592
02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:44.610
<v Speaker 7>I don't think it was St Harris who said </v>
<v Speaker 7>it though.</v>

2593
02:02:44.611 --> 02:02:46.420
<v Speaker 7>It might've been.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe it was Elon Musk,</v>

2594
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:49.830
<v Speaker 7>he was saying everyone thinks the </v>
<v Speaker 7>problem with a,</v>

2595
02:02:49.870 --> 02:02:53.590
<v Speaker 7>with ai is that it's going to be robots </v>
<v Speaker 7>killing people,</v>

2596
02:02:53.591 --> 02:02:54.424
<v Speaker 7>which is one part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the real problem is that the ai is </v>

2597
02:02:56.951 --> 02:02:57.784
<v Speaker 7>going to be able to start hacking the </v>
<v Speaker 7>human operating system and we kind of </v>

2598
02:03:02.141 --> 02:03:06.250
<v Speaker 7>have already witnessed that with the </v>
<v Speaker 7>twitter bots.</v>

2599
02:03:06.430 --> 02:03:09.740
<v Speaker 7>So it's like you can produce the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2600
02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:14.760
<v Speaker 7>you can produce the illusion of a </v>
<v Speaker 7>majority opinion using bots.</v>

2601
02:03:15.011 --> 02:03:15.844
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the more advanced right now you can </v>

2602
02:03:17.261 --> 02:03:18.094
<v Speaker 7>usually,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can at least kind of tell what the </v>

2603
02:03:19.181 --> 02:03:21.790
<v Speaker 7>bots are like.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You go back and look and you realize the</v>

2604
02:03:21.791 --> 02:03:22.624
<v Speaker 7>body has been tweeting every like five </v>
<v Speaker 7>minutes and it's got like lists of </v>

2605
02:03:25.811 --> 02:03:28.270
<v Speaker 7>people in it and it's usually tweeting </v>
<v Speaker 7>memes and it seems to be</v>

2606
02:03:28.270 --> 02:03:29.103
<v Speaker 6>Ben have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd have to chase it down if you just </v>

2607
02:03:30.311 --> 02:03:32.530
<v Speaker 6>looked at the comments itself after a </v>
<v Speaker 6>post,</v>

2608
02:03:32.890 --> 02:03:33.723
<v Speaker 6>like say if you're someone who opposes </v>
<v Speaker 6>president trump and they've got trump </v>

2609
02:03:36.371 --> 02:03:37.204
<v Speaker 6>bots that they use to go and attack </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone who says anything bad about </v>

2610
02:03:40.451 --> 02:03:41.284
<v Speaker 6>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you would just see the overwhelming </v>

2611
02:03:42.941 --> 02:03:45.250
<v Speaker 6>negative response versus positive.</v>

2612
02:03:45.610 --> 02:03:46.700
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well yeah,</v>

2613
02:03:46.910 --> 02:03:47.743
<v Speaker 7>but you could still,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess what I'm saying is like right </v>

2614
02:03:48.891 --> 02:03:51.560
<v Speaker 7>now there's a way you can tell </v>
<v Speaker 7>something's a bot,</v>

2615
02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:54.860
<v Speaker 7>but as ai gets better,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to start seeing.</v>

2616
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:55.783
<v Speaker 7>I've been thinking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're going to start seeing these </v>

2617
02:03:57.410 --> 02:03:58.243
<v Speaker 7>basically social networking farmers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the idea's like I created a teenage </v>

2618
02:04:02.391 --> 02:04:03.224
<v Speaker 7>bought in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I figured out a way to get it to create </v>

2619
02:04:05.871 --> 02:04:09.380
<v Speaker 7>its own facebook account and for like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>

2620
02:04:09.381 --> 02:04:10.214
<v Speaker 7>six years,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it just posts shit on its own facebook </v>

2621
02:04:13.071 --> 02:04:13.904
<v Speaker 7>account.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Giving the illusion that this is a </v>

2622
02:04:14.721 --> 02:04:18.470
<v Speaker 7>living thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now if I could do that with 7,000</v>

2623
02:04:18.471 --> 02:04:20.380
<v Speaker 7>of these teen bots,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so now I have a,</v>

2624
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:25.390
<v Speaker 7>have a bought swarm of 7,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>ais that all have facebook accounts,</v>

2625
02:04:27.021 --> 02:04:27.854
<v Speaker 7>twitter accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>instagram accounts that they've been </v>

2626
02:04:29.811 --> 02:04:33.350
<v Speaker 7>somehow populating with bullshit content</v>
<v Speaker 7>for like seven years.</v>

2627
02:04:33.530 --> 02:04:37.040
<v Speaker 7>So now no one can really even tell if </v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a person or not.</v>

2628
02:04:37.290 --> 02:04:38.280
<v Speaker 7>I've got a really</v>

2629
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:43.280
<v Speaker 2>super powerful weapon and so I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's the real creepy thing with</v>

2630
02:04:43.861 --> 02:04:44.970
<v Speaker 2>ai is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2631
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:45.833
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen that shit that popped up on </v>

2632
02:04:46.771 --> 02:04:47.590
<v Speaker 2>the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ability.</v>

2633
02:04:47.590 --> 02:04:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Here's a road in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2634
02:04:49.681 --> 02:04:51.660
<v Speaker 2>we just made it look like it's winter </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2635
02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:53.880
<v Speaker 2>We just made it look like it's nighttime</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2636
02:04:53.881 --> 02:04:54.714
<v Speaker 2>We just made it look like it's whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime of year that we want we can </v>

2637
02:04:57.541 --> 02:04:58.374
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to get to the point where we </v>

2638
02:04:58.951 --> 02:05:02.130
<v Speaker 2>can make a person look like they said </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything and you're not going to be able</v>

2639
02:05:02.131 --> 02:05:04.860
<v Speaker 2>to tell the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that,</v>

2640
02:05:04.890 --> 02:05:06.060
<v Speaker 2>that's here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

2641
02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:10.860
<v Speaker 2>I think it was radio lab or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that did a podcast here.</v>

2642
02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:13.590
<v Speaker 2>It's close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's discernible,</v>

2643
02:05:13.740 --> 02:05:15.150
<v Speaker 2>but it's getting close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2644
02:05:15.190 --> 02:05:17.970
<v Speaker 2>So we're talking about reality video and</v>
<v Speaker 2>audio.</v>

2645
02:05:18.150 --> 02:05:18.983
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it it.</v>

2646
02:05:19.380 --> 02:05:20.213
<v Speaker 2>It's reality bombs where you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to bomb a culture with ai </v>

2647
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:28.110
<v Speaker 2>produced the illusion of anything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking want,</v>

2648
02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:31.090
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in dme and people are gonna,</v>

2649
02:05:31.110 --> 02:05:33.030
<v Speaker 2>believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but devil's advocate here.</v>

2650
02:05:33.090 --> 02:05:34.830
<v Speaker 2>Haven't we been doing that for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

2651
02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that what a laugh track is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A studio audience,</v>

2652
02:05:37.690 --> 02:05:38.523
<v Speaker 2>but it's creating the illusion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>community of a bunch of people that </v>

2653
02:05:41.641 --> 02:05:42.474
<v Speaker 2>believe a certain thing that react </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain ways and that manipulates the </v>

2654
02:05:45.601 --> 02:05:48.360
<v Speaker 2>hordes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernays wrote about this in the twenties</v>

2655
02:05:48.361 --> 02:05:49.194
<v Speaker 2>about manipulating and effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's already been in its rudimentary </v>

2656
02:05:52.771 --> 02:05:53.604
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now imagine a super advanced form of </v>

2657
02:05:56.251 --> 02:05:57.084
<v Speaker 2>that and what you're looking at is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the re one of the real problems of ai </v>

2658
02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:03.420
<v Speaker 2>that maybe is more problematic than </v>
<v Speaker 2>robots going so fast.</v>

2659
02:06:03.421 --> 02:06:05.070
<v Speaker 2>You have to use a strobe light to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2660
02:06:05.340 --> 02:06:06.173
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about people no longer if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe that anything in the media </v>

2661
02:06:12.650 --> 02:06:13.483
<v Speaker 2>or on the Internet is real or if you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been trying to like establish your </v>

2662
02:06:16.801 --> 02:06:17.634
<v Speaker 2>concept of what the universe is or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is based on the news based on the </v>

2663
02:06:21.901 --> 02:06:22.734
<v Speaker 2>Internet and people have been doing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a long time with newspapers and </v>

2664
02:06:24.751 --> 02:06:25.380
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2665
02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:29.040
<v Speaker 2>Then we're going to enter into a phase </v>
<v Speaker 2>in human history where that is no longer</v>

2666
02:06:29.041 --> 02:06:29.874
<v Speaker 2>necessarily a way for us to gauge what </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality actually is because we're not </v>

2667
02:06:35.521 --> 02:06:38.400
<v Speaker 2>even gonna know fucking humans are </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating the content.</v>

2668
02:06:38.610 --> 02:06:39.443
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to get to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>point in time where we're not going to </v>

2669
02:06:41.281 --> 02:06:43.020
<v Speaker 2>know if someone's human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2670
02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:46.470
<v Speaker 2>blade is a real thing that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

2671
02:06:46.490 --> 02:06:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not far away.</v>

2672
02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:51.570
<v Speaker 2>They have some pretty God damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>convincing robot heads now in Japan.</v>

2673
02:06:51.630 --> 02:06:55.320
<v Speaker 2>Sex robots looking pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't look too bad and we're.</v>

2674
02:06:55.340 --> 02:06:56.173
<v Speaker 2>We're getting real close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're getting within 50 years away from </v>

2675
02:06:59.281 --> 02:07:03.600
<v Speaker 2>an indiscernible artificial life form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buddy of mine had a wet dream recently.</v>

2676
02:07:04.230 --> 02:07:05.063
<v Speaker 2>He's in his forties and he had a wet </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream where he was having sex with two </v>

2677
02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:11.700
<v Speaker 2>revolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sex robots.</v>

2678
02:07:11.730 --> 02:07:12.563
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2679
02:07:12.850 --> 02:07:13.683
<v Speaker 2>And that chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you could see right through </v>

2680
02:07:16.321 --> 02:07:17.610
<v Speaker 2>her legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was clear.</v>

2681
02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:19.970
<v Speaker 2>She had clear arms and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still fuck shit up.</v>

2682
02:07:20.490 --> 02:07:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was nice to you.</v>

2683
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:25.080
<v Speaker 2>How do you know what is real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2684
02:07:25.081 --> 02:07:27.830
<v Speaker 2>if it interacts with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're talking to a premier shit,</v>

2685
02:07:28.590 --> 02:07:29.423
<v Speaker 2>here's where it gets really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like there's this mystic name </v>

2686
02:07:32.261 --> 02:07:36.250
<v Speaker 2>Gurdjieff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he called people spiritual</v>

2687
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:41.250
<v Speaker 7>machines and so his thing was like most </v>
<v Speaker 7>people already are.</v>

2688
02:07:42.370 --> 02:07:47.320
<v Speaker 7>Robots are automatons and the sense that</v>
<v Speaker 7>most people when they're doing anything,</v>

2689
02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:50.320
<v Speaker 7>whatever the thing is they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's imitation.</v>

2690
02:07:50.700 --> 02:07:53.800
<v Speaker 7>So when a person like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>does any,</v>

2691
02:07:53.900 --> 02:07:56.350
<v Speaker 7>the way a person,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a person who's acting cool,</v>

2692
02:07:56.740 --> 02:07:57.573
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Usually the person who is acting cool </v>

2693
02:07:59.770 --> 02:08:03.220
<v Speaker 7>has Emma is learned that from something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's all limitation.</v>

2694
02:08:03.221 --> 02:08:07.150
<v Speaker 7>It's all autopilot already.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So most human beings,</v>

2695
02:08:07.330 --> 02:08:11.070
<v Speaker 7>they're not even autonomous at all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like how most of it,</v>

2696
02:08:11.230 --> 02:08:12.063
<v Speaker 7>most people will spend like three </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking days completely up in their </v>

2697
02:08:15.341 --> 02:08:17.980
<v Speaker 7>heads.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not even knowing where they're at.</v>

2698
02:08:17.981 --> 02:08:19.900
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know I've been in that situation where</v>

2699
02:08:19.901 --> 02:08:22.210
<v Speaker 7>like sometime will pass and suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll be like,</v>

2700
02:08:22.211 --> 02:08:23.590
<v Speaker 7>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck?</v>

2701
02:08:23.591 --> 02:08:26.380
<v Speaker 7>I've been in my head for three days </v>
<v Speaker 7>straight.</v>

2702
02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:29.560
<v Speaker 7>I'm running on autopilot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What's going on here man?</v>

2703
02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:31.240
<v Speaker 7>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how many people are.</v>

2704
02:08:31.240 --> 02:08:33.250
<v Speaker 7>They wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they get their coffee to get in a car.</v>

2705
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:34.570
<v Speaker 7>They go and do their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They come back,</v>

2706
02:08:34.571 --> 02:08:35.404
<v Speaker 7>they go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They barely even know what they're </v>

2707
02:08:36.611 --> 02:08:38.410
<v Speaker 7>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Momentum,</v>

2708
02:08:39.010 --> 02:08:39.910
<v Speaker 7>momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

2709
02:08:39.911 --> 02:08:40.744
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so we're already dealing with a kind of </v>

2710
02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:43.713
<v Speaker 7>organic robot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a meat machine that's barely even aware </v>

2711
02:08:46.691 --> 02:08:48.310
<v Speaker 7>of what it's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2712
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:51.550
<v Speaker 7>which is why I think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I know you and I talk about Christ a</v>

2713
02:08:51.551 --> 02:08:53.050
<v Speaker 7>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to bring it up on your show.</v>

2714
02:08:53.051 --> 02:08:55.570
<v Speaker 7>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When Jesus is being crucified,</v>

2715
02:08:55.571 --> 02:08:56.404
<v Speaker 7>I think one of the most poignant things </v>
<v Speaker 7>and the new testament is when Jesus is </v>

2716
02:08:59.271 --> 02:09:00.760
<v Speaker 7>being crucified,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he looks out and he says,</v>

2717
02:09:01.090 --> 02:09:02.380
<v Speaker 7>father,</v>
<v Speaker 7>forgive them.</v>

2718
02:09:02.650 --> 02:09:03.483
<v Speaker 7>They know not what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And a lot of people interpret that as </v>

2719
02:09:06.581 --> 02:09:07.414
<v Speaker 7>being like they don't know I'm Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I think what he's really saying is </v>

2720
02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:12.730
<v Speaker 7>they don't know what they're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>doing,</v>

2721
02:09:12.731 --> 02:09:13.660
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>period.</v>

2722
02:09:13.690 --> 02:09:15.820
<v Speaker 7>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're just on autopilot.</v>

2723
02:09:15.850 --> 02:09:19.900
<v Speaker 7>They don't know what they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're barely sentience yet.</v>

2724
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:21.310
<v Speaker 7>Termites in the mountain.</v>

2725
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:24.610
<v Speaker 6>Now let's think about what we were </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about earlier when we're talking</v>

2726
02:09:24.611 --> 02:09:27.160
<v Speaker 6>about a 50 year old who's trying to grab</v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

2727
02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:27.671
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2728
02:09:27.671 --> 02:09:30.790
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know if you were passing it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Give them some of that shit.</v>

2729
02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:34.360
<v Speaker 6>When we're talking about 50 year olds or</v>
<v Speaker 6>50 year old movies,</v>

2730
02:09:34.450 --> 02:09:35.283
<v Speaker 6>you know those old movies where men </v>
<v Speaker 6>smacked women and grabbed them and and </v>

2731
02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:40.930
<v Speaker 6>how you're seeing these big changes in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the way people behave.</v>

2732
02:09:41.410 --> 02:09:44.950
<v Speaker 6>Now let's go 2000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's,</v>

2733
02:09:44.980 --> 02:09:45.813
<v Speaker 6>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's go way back before written things </v>

2734
02:09:48.190 --> 02:09:49.023
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and let's go back before anybody knew </v>

2735
02:09:50.351 --> 02:09:53.430
<v Speaker 6>how to write things down or read and </v>
<v Speaker 6>let's imagine</v>

2736
02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:55.240
<v Speaker 7>like what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ten thousand years ago,</v>

2737
02:09:55.241 --> 02:09:56.074
<v Speaker 7>crypt 15,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that was eight for writing rudimentary </v>

2738
02:09:58.621 --> 02:09:59.454
<v Speaker 7>writing.</v>

2739
02:10:00.150 --> 02:10:01.440
<v Speaker 6>It's all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all insane.</v>

2740
02:10:01.770 --> 02:10:06.770
<v Speaker 6>If you really think about the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 6>raw change that's happening in our life,</v>

2741
02:10:08.580 --> 02:10:10.980
<v Speaker 6>just what's going on right now with this</v>
<v Speaker 6>whole me too.</v>

2742
02:10:10.981 --> 02:10:11.814
<v Speaker 6>Movement,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the sexual harassment and sexual </v>

2743
02:10:12.691 --> 02:10:16.200
<v Speaker 6>assault,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an outing of all these predators,</v>

2744
02:10:16.530 --> 02:10:17.700
<v Speaker 6>all of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm good.</v>

2745
02:10:17.701 --> 02:10:20.040
<v Speaker 6>Just put all this stuff that's happening</v>
<v Speaker 6>now,</v>

2746
02:10:20.041 --> 02:10:24.150
<v Speaker 6>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they get accelerated evolution,</v>

2747
02:10:24.570 --> 02:10:29.570
<v Speaker 6>accelerated cultural compatibility like </v>
<v Speaker 6>accelerated understanding of it.</v>

2748
02:10:31.050 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 6>Almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a new,</v>

2749
02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:40.000
<v Speaker 8>a new version of equality because it </v>
<v Speaker 8>used to be that like you could fuck your</v>

2750
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:42.680
<v Speaker 8>employee because your employee couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 8>say anything.</v>

2751
02:10:42.710 --> 02:10:43.341
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

2752
02:10:43.341 --> 02:10:44.180
<v Speaker 8>They couldn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2753
02:10:44.181 --> 02:10:45.014
<v Speaker 8>now they can.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now everybody can and now other people </v>

2754
02:10:46.731 --> 02:10:48.530
<v Speaker 8>find out about you and now it becomes an</v>
<v Speaker 8>issue.</v>

2755
02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:49.903
<v Speaker 8>It's all forced and so now we're going </v>
<v Speaker 8>to change the way we think about </v>

2756
02:10:52.701 --> 02:10:53.534
<v Speaker 8>behaving now and our standards going to </v>
<v Speaker 8>change because our standards have </v>

2757
02:10:55.641 --> 02:10:57.740
<v Speaker 8>radically changed from a thousand years </v>
<v Speaker 8>ago.</v>

2758
02:10:57.890 --> 02:10:58.723
<v Speaker 8>Radically changed from 2000 years ago </v>
<v Speaker 8>and radically changed from the 19 </v>

2759
02:11:01.491 --> 02:11:03.920
<v Speaker 8>fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you look at the 19 fifties and we see</v>

2760
02:11:03.921 --> 02:11:04.754
<v Speaker 8>it in uniquely,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so in the 19 fifties is that we can see </v>

2761
02:11:08.001 --> 02:11:12.020
<v Speaker 8>it in the form of mainstream media </v>
<v Speaker 8>films.</v>

2762
02:11:12.170 --> 02:11:16.010
<v Speaker 8>You can read about it in books,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but seeing it visually in films,</v>

2763
02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:17.233
<v Speaker 8>it's so shocking and stunning and you </v>
<v Speaker 8>see just the way people interacted with </v>

2764
02:11:20.481 --> 02:11:21.314
<v Speaker 8>each other and you just think about if </v>
<v Speaker 8>someone from like 1950 tried to exist </v>

2765
02:11:24.591 --> 02:11:26.120
<v Speaker 8>today,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it would be hilarious.</v>

2766
02:11:26.210 --> 02:11:27.043
<v Speaker 8>Would be hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just watching them try to interact with </v>

2767
02:11:29.151 --> 02:11:30.860
<v Speaker 8>everybody with phones and all the </v>
<v Speaker 8>studies.</v>

2768
02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:31.873
<v Speaker 8>They literally would be like a person </v>
<v Speaker 8>from a foreign world that's going to be </v>

2769
02:11:35.810 --> 02:11:36.643
<v Speaker 8>us a hundred years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>One hundred years from now this world </v>

2770
02:11:39.891 --> 02:11:42.160
<v Speaker 8>will be indiscernible.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's going.</v>

2771
02:11:42.250 --> 02:11:43.083
<v Speaker 8>The technology is like literally a </v>
<v Speaker 8>yellowstone about to blow up the entire </v>

2772
02:11:47.781 --> 02:11:50.630
<v Speaker 8>country that literally about the super </v>
<v Speaker 8>volcano,</v>

2773
02:11:50.631 --> 02:11:51.464
<v Speaker 8>the whole world,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and no one is prepared for the </v>

2774
02:11:53.271 --> 02:11:54.104
<v Speaker 8>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We just assume that the paradigms that </v>

2775
02:11:56.301 --> 02:11:59.810
<v Speaker 8>exist today are going to remain and that</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just going to get better.</v>

2776
02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:01.490
<v Speaker 8>It'd be easier to text people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2777
02:12:01.491 --> 02:12:02.324
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

2778
02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:03.303
<v Speaker 8>This,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this paradigm did not exist 2000 years </v>

2779
02:12:05.121 --> 02:12:06.560
<v Speaker 8>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This world,</v>

2780
02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:07.453
<v Speaker 8>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the way we operate and communicate and </v>

2781
02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:11.630
<v Speaker 8>even get around.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How about the way we get around?</v>

2782
02:12:11.631 --> 02:12:12.464
<v Speaker 8>How about this hard surface and these </v>
<v Speaker 8>metal boxes of rubber tires and now </v>

2783
02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:16.640
<v Speaker 8>fucking drive themselves.</v>

2784
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:18.960
<v Speaker 8>I mean we.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're at the.</v>

2785
02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:20.690
<v Speaker 8>We're at,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're in the middle of it,</v>

2786
02:12:20.810 --> 02:12:23.960
<v Speaker 8>but we're also at the gate to like </v>
<v Speaker 8>insanity,</v>

2787
02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:25.393
<v Speaker 8>pure,</v>
<v Speaker 8>absolute world changing and sandy from </v>

2788
02:12:27.711 --> 02:12:28.544
<v Speaker 8>DNA with Crispr,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they've just started injecting it into </v>

2789
02:12:31.341 --> 02:12:32.450
<v Speaker 8>live people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now,</v>

2790
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:35.720
<v Speaker 8>some guy with some incurable disease </v>
<v Speaker 8>allowed them to Guinea pig on him.</v>

2791
02:12:35.870 --> 02:12:37.820
<v Speaker 8>What if he gets fucking cured?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

2792
02:12:37.940 --> 02:12:39.800
<v Speaker 8>What if people figure out a way to get </v>
<v Speaker 8>smarter?</v>

2793
02:12:39.801 --> 02:12:40.634
<v Speaker 8>What have they developed?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Crispr telekinesis modules where they </v>

2794
02:12:43.611 --> 02:12:45.590
<v Speaker 8>can insert them into your fucking head </v>
<v Speaker 8>and use it,</v>

2795
02:12:45.591 --> 02:12:46.424
<v Speaker 8>works off your own body's electricity </v>
<v Speaker 8>and they never run bad and we all talk </v>

2796
02:12:50.461 --> 02:12:51.294
<v Speaker 8>to each other through our minds and then</v>
<v Speaker 8>in school they have to teach kids a new </v>

2797
02:12:53.541 --> 02:12:54.374
<v Speaker 8>language,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a universal language that's not not </v>

2798
02:12:57.291 --> 02:12:59.570
<v Speaker 8>phonetically based,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so people stopped talking.</v>

2799
02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:01.430
<v Speaker 8>So our heads grow big.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like aliens are.</v>

2800
02:13:01.431 --> 02:13:03.680
<v Speaker 8>Miles shiver up just like the aliens.</v>

2801
02:13:04.010 --> 02:13:05.530
<v Speaker 8>That's what the aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what that.</v>

2802
02:13:05.570 --> 02:13:06.403
<v Speaker 8>That archetype is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That alien archetype is like what we </v>

2803
02:13:08.991 --> 02:13:11.000
<v Speaker 8>know we're going to look like.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If we keep going,</v>

2804
02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:15.220
<v Speaker 8>we're all going to be like a merge of </v>
<v Speaker 8>colors because that's problematic.</v>

2805
02:13:15.230 --> 02:13:17.360
<v Speaker 8>All that Dick Stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That shit just gets in the way.</v>

2806
02:13:17.361 --> 02:13:20.180
<v Speaker 8>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Your your database now on your brain.</v>

2807
02:13:20.181 --> 02:13:21.050
<v Speaker 8>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2808
02:13:21.051 --> 02:13:21.884
<v Speaker 8>I liked this is the way Mckenna talked </v>
<v Speaker 8>about how like what he say octupus like </v>

2809
02:13:25.221 --> 02:13:26.540
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like all the limbs,</v>

2810
02:13:26.541 --> 02:13:29.180
<v Speaker 8>like they build the.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It has to communicate with body language</v>

2811
02:13:29.181 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 8>is so much more profound than it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2812
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Not only are we not going to have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>form,</v>

2813
02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:36.630
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be able to decide any </v>
<v Speaker 2>form we want,</v>

2814
02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:37.740
<v Speaker 2>any form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any form,</v>

2815
02:13:37.741 --> 02:13:39.810
<v Speaker 2>anything you want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be a fucking octupus.</v>

2816
02:13:40.290 --> 02:13:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Theoretically you could be an optimist </v>
<v Speaker 2>if we get.</v>

2817
02:13:43.410 --> 02:13:44.243
<v Speaker 2>If we get to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we get to that point also nuclear </v>

2818
02:13:46.810 --> 02:13:47.643
<v Speaker 2>arsenals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuking ourselves or without like actual </v>

2819
02:13:49.891 --> 02:13:54.030
<v Speaker 2>yellowstone or without like sending out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we just haven't produced,</v>

2820
02:13:54.210 --> 02:13:54.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2821
02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:55.493
<v Speaker 2>we always are scanning this guys for </v>
<v Speaker 2>radio signals or that's what we used to </v>

2822
02:13:59.131 --> 02:13:59.964
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe we haven't even produced a </v>

2823
02:14:01.321 --> 02:14:02.154
<v Speaker 2>signal than an advanced civilization </v>
<v Speaker 2>would identify as being something that </v>

2824
02:14:05.701 --> 02:14:08.730
<v Speaker 2>would come from a civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the moment we do it,</v>

2825
02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:14.000
<v Speaker 2>the moment somebody at cern or somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>at Darpa produces some kind of beam that</v>

2826
02:14:14.401 --> 02:14:16.960
<v Speaker 2>emanates from the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just summons a,</v>

2827
02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:22.280
<v Speaker 2>just a fucking legion of like crafts </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just want to enslave us,</v>

2828
02:14:22.501 --> 02:14:24.600
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2829
02:14:24.601 --> 02:14:28.980
<v Speaker 2>It just like the first little like boop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they're ready to harvest them.</v>

2830
02:14:29.290 --> 02:14:30.123
<v Speaker 6>Weirdest thoughts that I've ever had </v>
<v Speaker 6>about interacting with other aliens or </v>

2831
02:14:33.161 --> 02:14:36.790
<v Speaker 6>other life forms for another planet is </v>
<v Speaker 6>not that it's a signal,</v>

2832
02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:37.833
<v Speaker 6>it's not that like you you'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you can go to a place that you can </v>

2833
02:14:40.871 --> 02:14:44.490
<v Speaker 6>transform,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like whatever your consciousness is into</v>

2834
02:14:44.500 --> 02:14:48.760
<v Speaker 6>something that can travel to different </v>
<v Speaker 6>dementias and that these things exist in</v>

2835
02:14:48.761 --> 02:14:52.750
<v Speaker 6>dimensional planes as much as they exist</v>
<v Speaker 6>in physical locations,</v>

2836
02:14:52.810 --> 02:14:53.643
<v Speaker 6>so maybe it's got a physical location of</v>
<v Speaker 6>a hundred billion light years away or </v>

2837
02:14:56.411 --> 02:14:57.400
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2838
02:14:57.670 --> 02:14:59.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's also right here.</v>

2839
02:14:59.910 --> 02:15:03.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like in that it's all tied in together.</v>

2840
02:15:03.301 --> 02:15:04.134
<v Speaker 6>Like there's this really rudimentary </v>
<v Speaker 6>crude physical distance space that we </v>

2841
02:15:08.801 --> 02:15:09.634
<v Speaker 6>operate in on a daily basis because </v>
<v Speaker 6>we're still as advanced as we are for </v>

2842
02:15:12.881 --> 02:15:15.520
<v Speaker 6>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're still fairly low level in terms of</v>

2843
02:15:16.030 --> 02:15:16.863
<v Speaker 6>the ability to spring forth and entire </v>
<v Speaker 6>universe from something the size of the </v>

2844
02:15:20.201 --> 02:15:22.180
<v Speaker 6>head of a pin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is what the Big Bang is,</v>

2845
02:15:22.181 --> 02:15:22.360
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2846
02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:23.193
<v Speaker 6>So some insanely complex webbing of just</v>
<v Speaker 6>insane distance plus potential life </v>

2847
02:15:30.171 --> 02:15:32.310
<v Speaker 6>forms and different styles of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

2848
02:15:32.370 --> 02:15:33.203
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of life that could exist and all these </v>

2849
02:15:34.451 --> 02:15:35.284
<v Speaker 6>different planets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hundreds of billions of known galaxies </v>

2850
02:15:38.590 --> 02:15:40.000
<v Speaker 6>in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so big.</v>

2851
02:15:40.090 --> 02:15:40.923
<v Speaker 6>Lawrence Krauss tried to explain to me </v>
<v Speaker 6>the size of the universe and he changed </v>

2852
02:15:44.081 --> 02:15:44.914
<v Speaker 6>the way I looked at it because he said </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not that we know for sure that the </v>

2853
02:15:49.811 --> 02:15:52.810
<v Speaker 6>universe is 13 point 7 billion years </v>
<v Speaker 6>old,</v>

2854
02:15:53.020 --> 02:15:56.620
<v Speaker 6>but that's as far back as we can see </v>
<v Speaker 6>with what we have now.</v>

2855
02:15:56.710 --> 02:15:57.543
<v Speaker 6>And he was saying that time that he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to make some distinction between </v>

2856
02:16:02.561 --> 02:16:03.394
<v Speaker 6>the amount of time it would take to go </v>
<v Speaker 6>back more than 13 point 7 billion years </v>

2857
02:16:09.130 --> 02:16:09.963
<v Speaker 6>in that time literally moves faster than</v>
<v Speaker 6>that and that you can't detect it after </v>

2858
02:16:15.821 --> 02:16:16.760
<v Speaker 6>what we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're,</v>

2859
02:16:16.860 --> 02:16:20.620
<v Speaker 6>we're very limited in our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 6>detect things after a certain space.</v>

2860
02:16:20.770 --> 02:16:21.603
<v Speaker 6>So he's not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Universe is only 13 point 7 billion </v>

2861
02:16:23.831 --> 02:16:26.890
<v Speaker 6>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might be infinitely old.</v>

2862
02:16:27.130 --> 02:16:28.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's as far as we can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>what their.</v>

2863
02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:30.100
<v Speaker 2>So we assume</v>

2864
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:30.750
<v Speaker 3>that's all there is.</v>

2865
02:16:30.750 --> 02:16:32.910
<v Speaker 8>Well that's what they have to operate </v>
<v Speaker 8>on.</v>

2866
02:16:32.911 --> 02:16:34.050
<v Speaker 8>What they can prove now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

2867
02:16:34.051 --> 02:16:34.884
<v Speaker 8>So this is what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What we can prove now is that light is </v>

2868
02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:38.873
<v Speaker 8>the light.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're getting is 13 point 7 billion </v>

2869
02:16:40.891 --> 02:16:41.724
<v Speaker 8>years old or the radio waves that </v>
<v Speaker 8>indicate that there was some sort of an </v>

2870
02:16:43.921 --> 02:16:47.250
<v Speaker 8>explosion,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but all of it is like super sketchy man.</v>

2871
02:16:47.300 --> 02:16:50.340
<v Speaker 8>They're writing things down on a little </v>
<v Speaker 8>legal notepad.</v>

2872
02:16:50.370 --> 02:16:51.203
<v Speaker 8>They're all agreeing with the math and </v>
<v Speaker 8>looking at it and they're way fucking </v>

2873
02:16:53.551 --> 02:16:56.430
<v Speaker 8>smarter than me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so they're probably right about a lot of</v>

2874
02:16:56.431 --> 02:16:57.264
<v Speaker 8>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's entirely possible that just we </v>

2875
02:16:58.711 --> 02:17:02.880
<v Speaker 8>don't have the ability to detect how </v>
<v Speaker 8>much further it actually goes back.</v>

2876
02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:03.933
<v Speaker 8>Might have this whole faulty assumption </v>
<v Speaker 8>of this initial beginning of the </v>

2877
02:17:07.891 --> 02:17:12.060
<v Speaker 8>universe might be bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There might literally not have ever been</v>

2878
02:17:12.061 --> 02:17:14.040
<v Speaker 8>a beginning because it has always been </v>
<v Speaker 8>here.</v>

2879
02:17:14.041 --> 02:17:14.420
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

2880
02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:15.253
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my area they've been saying </v>

2881
02:17:16.250 --> 02:17:19.550
<v Speaker 3>anatomically modern human beings have </v>
<v Speaker 3>existed for 200,000</v>

2882
02:17:19.551 --> 02:17:20.780
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what everybody,</v>

2883
02:17:20.781 --> 02:17:22.370
<v Speaker 3>including me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rights in the books,</v>

2884
02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:23.233
<v Speaker 3>you know the accepted wisdom couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>months ago they found remains in </v>

2885
02:17:26.361 --> 02:17:28.880
<v Speaker 3>Morocco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seemed to be about 300,000</v>

2886
02:17:28.881 --> 02:17:31.710
<v Speaker 3>years old that appear to be from </v>
<v Speaker 3>anatomically modern human.</v>

2887
02:17:31.711 --> 02:17:32.544
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2888
02:17:32.930 --> 02:17:33.763
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you say something goes back </v>

2889
02:17:36.261 --> 02:17:38.020
<v Speaker 3>while you've had Graham Hancock on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot,</v>

2890
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.863
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you say something goes back a </v>

2891
02:17:39.441 --> 02:17:40.274
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>often what you're saying is that's how </v>

2892
02:17:41.721 --> 02:17:44.330
<v Speaker 3>far back we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We found something for that.</v>

2893
02:17:44.331 --> 02:17:47.030
<v Speaker 3>We can detect it in the case of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>space exploration.</v>

2894
02:17:47.170 --> 02:17:49.690
<v Speaker 8>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And here's what's really insane.</v>

2895
02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:52.240
<v Speaker 8>Let's give him the benefit of the doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's go half a million.</v>

2896
02:17:52.900 --> 02:17:54.280
<v Speaker 8>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2897
02:17:54.370 --> 02:17:56.710
<v Speaker 8>it's a blink of an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A half a million years ago.</v>

2898
02:17:56.711 --> 02:18:00.700
<v Speaker 8>We were literally some kind of eighth </v>
<v Speaker 8>thing half a million years ago,</v>

2899
02:18:00.701 --> 02:18:01.271
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2900
02:18:01.271 --> 02:18:02.410
<v Speaker 8>Well we,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Australia pithy,</v>

2901
02:18:02.411 --> 02:18:03.520
<v Speaker 8>that gets 2 million years ago.</v>

2902
02:18:05.930 --> 02:18:07.220
<v Speaker 3>Australopithecus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2903
02:18:07.221 --> 02:18:08.054
<v Speaker 3>I stick with anatomically modern humans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why that really jumps out at </v>

2904
02:18:11.631 --> 02:18:12.411
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2905
02:18:12.411 --> 02:18:14.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm not real clear on Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perth,</v>

2906
02:18:14.630 --> 02:18:17.240
<v Speaker 3>the kiss and Cro Magnon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2907
02:18:17.241 --> 02:18:19.850
<v Speaker 3>I know neanderthals lived up to about </v>
<v Speaker 3>40,000</v>

2908
02:18:19.851 --> 02:18:21.880
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can interbred with human.</v>

2909
02:18:21.980 --> 02:18:23.270
<v Speaker 8>How crazy is that one?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2910
02:18:23.540 --> 02:18:26.540
<v Speaker 8>So that means there was some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 8>like cultures,</v>

2911
02:18:26.750 --> 02:18:29.300
<v Speaker 8>there was some sort of like villages and</v>
<v Speaker 8>shit back then.</v>

2912
02:18:29.690 --> 02:18:31.710
<v Speaker 8>Now stop and think how crazy that is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And we're,</v>

2913
02:18:31.711 --> 02:18:32.544
<v Speaker 8>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're talking about like Mesopotamia or </v>

2914
02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:34.733
<v Speaker 8>mayor or a rack,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're talking about these incredibly </v>

2915
02:18:37.401 --> 02:18:38.234
<v Speaker 8>advanced for the time civilizations that</v>
<v Speaker 8>are like the oldest known modern style </v>

2916
02:18:42.651 --> 02:18:44.600
<v Speaker 8>civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 8>early 6,000</v>

2917
02:18:44.601 --> 02:18:45.860
<v Speaker 8>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know.</v>

2918
02:18:45.861 --> 02:18:47.690
<v Speaker 8>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's so crazy.</v>

2919
02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:48.833
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually had an idea for a book which </v>

2920
02:18:50.910 --> 02:18:53.040
<v Speaker 3>the rate I write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never live to write it,</v>

2921
02:18:53.041 --> 02:18:58.020
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is to look at the known </v>
<v Speaker 3>unknowns in science,</v>

2922
02:18:58.021 --> 02:18:58.854
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there are things that are you </v>

2923
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:02.220
<v Speaker 3>elucidated and example earlier where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2924
02:19:02.580 --> 02:19:03.413
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how far we can detect that </v>

2925
02:19:04.561 --> 02:19:06.720
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean that's how far it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we know,</v>

2926
02:19:06.721 --> 02:19:07.680
<v Speaker 3>we don't know that</v>

2927
02:19:08.070 --> 02:19:08.903
<v Speaker 8>there's a lot of arrogance in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>assumption that we have all the data </v>

2928
02:19:11.521 --> 02:19:14.550
<v Speaker 8>when it comes to the civilizations to </v>
<v Speaker 8>like how old they are.</v>

2929
02:19:14.570 --> 02:19:17.550
<v Speaker 8>Like who you're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're weird going into 6,000</v>

2930
02:19:17.551 --> 02:19:18.384
<v Speaker 8>years,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're not getting a lot of stuff when </v>

2931
02:19:19.741 --> 02:19:22.650
<v Speaker 8>you go for thousand years before that </v>
<v Speaker 8>you're getting way less stuff.</v>

2932
02:19:23.070 --> 02:19:24.510
<v Speaker 8>You go 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 8>years before that.</v>

2933
02:19:24.511 --> 02:19:26.110
<v Speaker 8>You might not have any stuff left.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

2934
02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:28.290
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There might be like some shards of metal</v>

2935
02:19:28.291 --> 02:19:30.650
<v Speaker 8>that you can explain and you can carbon </v>
<v Speaker 8>date those anyway.</v>

2936
02:19:30.651 --> 02:19:33.650
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I think rock you can carbon date.</v>

2937
02:19:33.651 --> 02:19:36.350
<v Speaker 8>You need like physical things later,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like living right,</v>

2938
02:19:36.351 --> 02:19:39.440
<v Speaker 8>like you need like wood or food for </v>
<v Speaker 8>carbon,</v>

2939
02:19:39.710 --> 02:19:41.630
<v Speaker 8>carbon dating.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is that how they're doing it still?</v>

2940
02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:42.710
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think there's a,</v>

2941
02:19:42.711 --> 02:19:44.090
<v Speaker 8>there's some other,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2942
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:47.210
<v Speaker 8>isotope that they're using that they </v>
<v Speaker 8>don't need the carbon,</v>

2943
02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:50.840
<v Speaker 8>the carbon is accepted and the other </v>
<v Speaker 8>one's quite new.</v>

2944
02:19:51.170 --> 02:19:53.240
<v Speaker 8>It's pretty fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They were so smart,</v>

2945
02:19:53.241 --> 02:19:57.170
<v Speaker 8>not us obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but someone out there is so smart.</v>

2946
02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:01.640
<v Speaker 8>They could take a piece of something and</v>
<v Speaker 8>tell you roughly how old it is.</v>

2947
02:20:02.170 --> 02:20:03.003
<v Speaker 8>That's fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And apparently gets a little screwy in </v>

2948
02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:07.213
<v Speaker 8>places where there's higher levels of </v>
<v Speaker 8>carbon and there's like some weirdness </v>

2949
02:20:10.551 --> 02:20:11.384
<v Speaker 8>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>especially initially when it was first </v>

2950
02:20:12.201 --> 02:20:14.360
<v Speaker 8>invented,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but just the fact that that exists,</v>

2951
02:20:14.510 --> 02:20:15.350
<v Speaker 8>that someone could say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

2952
02:20:15.530 --> 02:20:19.220
<v Speaker 8>well we found out that the dinosaurs </v>
<v Speaker 8>died 65 million years ago.</v>

2953
02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:21.410
<v Speaker 8>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what the fuck?</v>

2954
02:20:21.411 --> 02:20:26.411
<v Speaker 8>Do you know that Chesney fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Did you figure that out?</v>

2955
02:20:28.060 --> 02:20:31.160
<v Speaker 8>And and meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 8>probably a hundred years from now,</v>

2956
02:20:31.161 --> 02:20:33.830
<v Speaker 8>they'll have something that'll tell you </v>
<v Speaker 8>that day the asteroid hit,</v>

2957
02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:35.113
<v Speaker 8>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they'll show you like a model of the </v>

2958
02:20:36.771 --> 02:20:37.604
<v Speaker 8>Yucatan before and after.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You'll be able to watch it with the HTC </v>

2959
02:20:39.951 --> 02:20:41.510
<v Speaker 8>Vive,</v>
<v Speaker 8>put it over your head.</v>

2960
02:20:41.511 --> 02:20:46.220
<v Speaker 8>You'll be able to literally watch an </v>
<v Speaker 8>accurate representation of that giant.</v>

2961
02:20:46.220 --> 02:20:48.210
<v Speaker 8>Was it five miles wide?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2962
02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:49.093
<v Speaker 8>The crater.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The action asteroid itself that killed </v>

2963
02:20:51.501 --> 02:20:52.520
<v Speaker 8>all the dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2964
02:20:52.610 --> 02:20:55.880
<v Speaker 8>I want to say it was five miles wide,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it might be making that up.</v>

2965
02:20:56.300 --> 02:20:57.133
<v Speaker 8>Five.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Imagine five mile wide city slamming </v>

2966
02:21:00.621 --> 02:21:02.450
<v Speaker 8>into the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 8>going 45,000</v>

2967
02:21:02.451 --> 02:21:03.284
<v Speaker 8>miles an hour from space and you could </v>
<v Speaker 8>watch it all take place in virtual </v>

2968
02:21:06.021 --> 02:21:07.550
<v Speaker 8>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's going to happen.</v>

2969
02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:09.113
<v Speaker 8>You gotta be able to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're going to literally witness the </v>

2970
02:21:11.421 --> 02:21:12.254
<v Speaker 8>people coming off the mayflower and </v>
<v Speaker 8>clubbing native Americans and raping </v>

2971
02:21:15.171 --> 02:21:16.004
<v Speaker 8>them and killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You will be able to literally see </v>

2972
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:19.910
<v Speaker 8>westworld.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You Seen Westworld?</v>

2973
02:21:20.110 --> 02:21:21.700
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2974
02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:23.090
<v Speaker 8>It's intense,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I mean,</v>

2975
02:21:23.091 --> 02:21:27.120
<v Speaker 8>I think that they're going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 8>recreate things in.</v>

2976
02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:30.530
<v Speaker 8>As computing power gets more and more </v>
<v Speaker 8>power.</v>

2977
02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:31.393
<v Speaker 8>The only real problem would be things </v>
<v Speaker 8>that really prehistorical in terms of </v>

2978
02:21:34.131 --> 02:21:36.890
<v Speaker 8>like cultural things,</v>
<v Speaker 8>maybe not like physical animal things,</v>

2979
02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:37.933
<v Speaker 8>but as far as like things that people </v>
<v Speaker 8>did or didn't do because they vary so </v>

2980
02:21:40.131 --> 02:21:43.130
<v Speaker 8>much,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it'd be so hard to pin down without real</v>

2981
02:21:43.430 --> 02:21:47.660
<v Speaker 8>accurate like images and videos,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but from here on out,</v>

2982
02:21:48.020 --> 02:21:48.853
<v Speaker 8>from here on out there,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're going to be able to have </v>

2983
02:21:51.411 --> 02:21:55.160
<v Speaker 8>recreations of things that happened that</v>
<v Speaker 8>are going to be indistinguishable.</v>

2984
02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:58.640
<v Speaker 8>They have images of all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Everybody has a facebook page.</v>

2985
02:21:58.730 --> 02:22:00.210
<v Speaker 8>Everybody has a picture of you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Alright,</v>

2986
02:22:00.260 --> 02:22:04.460
<v Speaker 8>so the 300 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever it will be in 100 years,</v>

2987
02:22:04.610 --> 02:22:07.820
<v Speaker 8>320 million people that exist in this </v>
<v Speaker 8>country right now.</v>

2988
02:22:07.850 --> 02:22:08.683
<v Speaker 8>There's a probably a picture of </v>
<v Speaker 8>everybody that that was not the case a </v>

2989
02:22:12.380 --> 02:22:13.213
<v Speaker 8>hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

2990
02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:15.560
<v Speaker 8>In the future,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's going to be some sort of a three</v>

2991
02:22:15.561 --> 02:22:16.394
<v Speaker 8>dimensional version of you that you use </v>
<v Speaker 8>as an Avatar and you three d games and </v>

2992
02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:20.913
<v Speaker 8>that's going to look exactly like you </v>
<v Speaker 8>and they're going to be able to make </v>

2993
02:22:23.451 --> 02:22:26.040
<v Speaker 8>something that literally recreates</v>

2994
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:27.210
<v Speaker 2>moments in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2995
02:22:27.211 --> 02:22:28.044
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be able to like take your social </v>

2996
02:22:29.101 --> 02:22:29.934
<v Speaker 2>thumbprint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be able to </v>

2997
02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:34.380
<v Speaker 2>theoretically they could scan all your </v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram posts or facebook posts,</v>

2998
02:22:34.381 --> 02:22:36.510
<v Speaker 2>all your tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even your podcast,</v>

2999
02:22:36.511 --> 02:22:39.120
<v Speaker 2>analyze your voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get an idea of your personality,</v>

3000
02:22:39.121 --> 02:22:42.480
<v Speaker 2>construct some kind of massive amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>data,</v>

3001
02:22:42.481 --> 02:22:43.314
<v Speaker 2>feed it to an ai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say create a personality based on this </v>

3002
02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:48.150
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's their picture,</v>

3003
02:22:48.330 --> 02:22:49.163
<v Speaker 2>animate the picture and now you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>cloned yourself in ai is like basically </v>

3004
02:22:53.041 --> 02:22:53.874
<v Speaker 2>imbued all the data that exists and has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been used to imbue an image of you with </v>

3005
02:22:59.251 --> 02:23:02.430
<v Speaker 2>your personality and now you are living </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some kind of simulator,</v>

3006
02:23:02.431 --> 02:23:06.480
<v Speaker 2>which means that you're going to be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to anyone who has ever had their picture</v>

3007
02:23:06.481 --> 02:23:11.481
<v Speaker 2>taken and as some kind of data out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>to establish some kind of personality.</v>

3008
02:23:12.060 --> 02:23:14.640
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be able to use that to make a.</v>

3009
02:23:14.730 --> 02:23:18.630
<v Speaker 2>to simulate individuals that have lived </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past and do it.</v>

3010
02:23:18.680 --> 02:23:21.600
<v Speaker 2>It's going to get really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethically because it's like,</v>

3011
02:23:21.601 --> 02:23:23.400
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me fucking take.</v>

3012
02:23:23.401 --> 02:23:24.420
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

3013
02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:26.310
<v Speaker 2>he's somebody out there with like a huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>social.</v>

3014
02:23:26.311 --> 02:23:28.110
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me take Taylor swift.</v>

3015
02:23:28.111 --> 02:23:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take her.</v>

3016
02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:30.833
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna have my ai produce a mini </v>
<v Speaker 2>Taylor swift and I'm going to drop her </v>

3017
02:23:35.580 --> 02:23:36.413
<v Speaker 2>into like a simulated reality filled </v>
<v Speaker 2>with fire breathing scorpions to see </v>

3018
02:23:41.011 --> 02:23:41.844
<v Speaker 2>what Taylor swift would do if she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like running through some doom </v>

3019
02:23:44.761 --> 02:23:45.594
<v Speaker 2>simulator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna have to come up with laws </v>

3020
02:23:47.341 --> 02:23:49.200
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like you don't,</v>

3021
02:23:49.201 --> 02:23:52.650
<v Speaker 2>you can't duplicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't duplicate without permission.</v>

3022
02:23:52.950 --> 02:23:53.783
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about them on the podcast before </v>

3023
02:23:54.871 --> 02:23:56.130
<v Speaker 2>with robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>

3024
02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:56.993
<v Speaker 2>what's going to stop you from making a </v>
<v Speaker 2>replica of say Jennifer Lopez for a sex </v>

3025
02:24:00.331 --> 02:24:02.550
<v Speaker 2>robot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks exactly like Jennifer Lopez and</v>

3026
02:24:02.551 --> 02:24:03.900
<v Speaker 2>is that a violation of her?</v>

3027
02:24:04.170 --> 02:24:05.430
<v Speaker 2>You go over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3028
02:24:05.460 --> 02:24:06.293
<v Speaker 2>you go to the store and you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally buy a Jennifer Lopez fucked </v>

3029
02:24:09.211 --> 02:24:10.860
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks indistinguishable.</v>

3030
02:24:10.861 --> 02:24:13.010
<v Speaker 2>You take it home and you fucked Jennifer</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lowe more like,</v>

3031
02:24:13.050 --> 02:24:13.883
<v Speaker 2>more than likely it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have some kind of like </v>

3032
02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:17.033
<v Speaker 2>what you would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess would be some kind of generic </v>

3033
02:24:18.961 --> 02:24:19.794
<v Speaker 2>looking fucked all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you put ai goggles on or augmented </v>

3034
02:24:23.521 --> 02:24:28.380
<v Speaker 2>reality goggles on it projects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever you want onto this thing.</v>

3035
02:24:28.381 --> 02:24:29.260
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

3036
02:24:29.261 --> 02:24:32.340
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't go buy a fucked all based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a celebrity.</v>

3037
02:24:32.490 --> 02:24:33.323
<v Speaker 2>You would just have some kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically a screen in the form of an </v>

3038
02:24:37.351 --> 02:24:42.351
<v Speaker 2>android that your augmented reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>would project a person onto that.</v>

3039
02:24:42.661 --> 02:24:45.000
<v Speaker 2>So it kind of in love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3040
02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I mean that's the,</v>

3041
02:24:46.220 --> 02:24:49.260
<v Speaker 2>that's where it gets a deal person on </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want.</v>

3042
02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:50.133
<v Speaker 2>And that's where it gets really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird is that's the other thing that </v>

3043
02:24:51.980 --> 02:24:55.020
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be able to do is you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna be able to sit across from someone</v>

3044
02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:56.153
<v Speaker 2>and project onto them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone that you want so that no longer </v>

3045
02:25:00.350 --> 02:25:01.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>

3046
02:25:01.170 --> 02:25:03.120
<v Speaker 2>you'll be talking to western Winston </v>
<v Speaker 2>Churchill,</v>

3047
02:25:03.460 --> 02:25:04.690
<v Speaker 2>your girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3048
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:08.370
<v Speaker 2>You and I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could cope project something onto Joe.</v>

3049
02:25:09.300 --> 02:25:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Could be like a game we'd play together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3050
02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:12.533
<v Speaker 2>Well especially if we all decided to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live in virtual reality and if we spent </v>

3051
02:25:15.151 --> 02:25:18.960
<v Speaker 2>most of our time alone in a room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we felt like we were all hanging out</v>

3052
02:25:18.961 --> 02:25:19.794
<v Speaker 2>together and the feeling is </v>
<v Speaker 2>indistinguishable than being in a </v>

3053
02:25:22.621 --> 02:25:24.210
<v Speaker 2>physical location.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3054
02:25:24.390 --> 02:25:25.870
<v Speaker 9>This is going to be a lot of that going </v>
<v Speaker 9>on,</v>

3055
02:25:25.871 --> 02:25:27.760
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Then you don't need a body anymore.</v>

3056
02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:30.490
<v Speaker 9>We're going to get super close to the </v>
<v Speaker 9>alien thing,</v>

3057
02:25:30.491 --> 02:25:31.324
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We're going to engineer big giant heads </v>

3058
02:25:33.060 --> 02:25:33.893
<v Speaker 9>and we're all going to exist in there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's going to be htc vives built was </v>

3059
02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:38.440
<v Speaker 9>no more atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We're going to blow out the atmosphere.</v>

3060
02:25:38.441 --> 02:25:41.110
<v Speaker 9>So we have built in sunglasses.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's why the aliens have the big black</v>

3061
02:25:41.111 --> 02:25:43.720
<v Speaker 9>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Those are like bill built in ray band.</v>

3062
02:25:43.721 --> 02:25:46.610
<v Speaker 9>Wayfair's.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

3063
02:25:46.910 --> 02:25:47.743
<v Speaker 9>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think it's brought to you by ray ban </v>

3064
02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:54.910
<v Speaker 9>skin that doesn't get cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's bulletproof to figure that out.</v>

3065
02:25:54.940 --> 02:25:55.773
<v Speaker 9>Don't you think this is like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when you smoked DMT and I've never </v>

3066
02:25:59.921 --> 02:26:02.860
<v Speaker 9>smoked dmt and I never would do any </v>
<v Speaker 9>illegal psychedelic,</v>

3067
02:26:02.861 --> 02:26:06.820
<v Speaker 9>but let's say that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 9>let's say that I had recently done it at</v>

3068
02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:07.720
<v Speaker 9>like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know,</v>

3069
02:26:07.721 --> 02:26:10.180
<v Speaker 9>burning man where no one's doing drugs </v>
<v Speaker 9>there anymore,</v>

3070
02:26:10.181 --> 02:26:13.190
<v Speaker 9>but let's say that I had done it there,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I,</v>

3071
02:26:14.620 --> 02:26:18.910
<v Speaker 9>they're so confused anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Back in the old days,</v>

3072
02:26:19.110 --> 02:26:21.580
<v Speaker 9>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so making up that I had had that I had a</v>

3073
02:26:21.581 --> 02:26:22.414
<v Speaker 9>crazy</v>

3074
02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:23.920
<v Speaker 2>man where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3075
02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:29.520
<v Speaker 2>I looked down after drinking this very </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong mint tea and I saw this,</v>

3076
02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:34.240
<v Speaker 2>I saw this fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

3077
02:26:34.250 --> 02:26:36.140
<v Speaker 2>it looked like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a look,</v>

3078
02:26:36.190 --> 02:26:39.490
<v Speaker 2>kind of like a cow or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but coming out of it,</v>

3079
02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:44.300
<v Speaker 2>it had this long neck with like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological lantern hanging off of it.</v>

3080
02:26:44.780 --> 02:26:47.450
<v Speaker 2>And I'm looking at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting about dmts,</v>

3081
02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:51.230
<v Speaker 2>you look away and he looked back now </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking things still there,</v>

3082
02:26:51.231 --> 02:26:52.400
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just right there.</v>

3083
02:26:52.401 --> 02:26:53.234
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck got sucked through this </v>

3084
02:26:55.460 --> 02:27:00.460
<v Speaker 2>tube into this beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful domed structure.</v>

3085
02:27:03.740 --> 02:27:04.573
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so pretty and it was just </v>

3086
02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:07.333
<v Speaker 2>spinning with potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just pure potentiality and I'm </v>

3087
02:27:10.401 --> 02:27:13.940
<v Speaker 2>looking at this incredible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's technology for sure.</v>

3088
02:27:13.941 --> 02:27:14.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3089
02:27:14.481 --> 02:27:17.690
<v Speaker 2>This was the way my brain was </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpreting it as like,</v>

3090
02:27:17.691 --> 02:27:18.524
<v Speaker 2>this is technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm looking at some kind of super </v>

3091
02:27:20.721 --> 02:27:21.554
<v Speaker 2>advanced simulator or some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine that is like simulating </v>

3092
02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:26.720
<v Speaker 2>realities and I'm looking at it.</v>

3093
02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:27.321
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>

3094
02:27:27.321 --> 02:27:30.350
<v Speaker 2>it's just so much potential here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought to myself,</v>

3095
02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:34.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to miss my friends if I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hang out in this place,</v>

3096
02:27:34.671 --> 02:27:38.180
<v Speaker 2>because the interesting thing about dmt </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there's a sense of,</v>

3097
02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:39.073
<v Speaker 2>or I've heard other people report this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense of incredible familiarity or </v>

3098
02:27:42.351 --> 02:27:44.510
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have been here.</v>

3099
02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:45.433
<v Speaker 2>In fact this is home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you realize that feeling of </v>

3100
02:27:47.121 --> 02:27:47.954
<v Speaker 2>coming home is actually this is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even close to the feeling of </v>

3101
02:27:51.921 --> 02:27:55.010
<v Speaker 2>being at home here and I'm looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>around at this and thinking,</v>

3102
02:27:56.210 --> 02:27:56.961
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my friends,</v>

3103
02:27:56.961 --> 02:27:58.340
<v Speaker 2>my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about all my friends?</v>

3104
02:27:58.341 --> 02:27:59.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in this space,</v>

3105
02:27:59.631 --> 02:28:01.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to miss them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that thing,</v>

3106
02:28:01.221 --> 02:28:02.570
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

3107
02:28:02.571 --> 02:28:04.700
<v Speaker 2>might as well be a voice is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3108
02:28:05.300 --> 02:28:06.133
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can always go back there and then I </v>

3109
02:28:07.611 --> 02:28:10.400
<v Speaker 2>open my eyes and I'm back at burning </v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3110
02:28:10.401 --> 02:28:13.220
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with my friends and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I realized,</v>

3111
02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get reincarnation,</v>

3112
02:28:15.441 --> 02:28:15.740
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3113
02:28:15.740 --> 02:28:16.573
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing you're talking about the </v>

3114
02:28:17.301 --> 02:28:18.134
<v Speaker 2>simulator that is going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes after having taken </v>

3115
02:28:21.861 --> 02:28:22.521
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

3116
02:28:22.521 --> 02:28:22.731
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3117
02:28:22.731 --> 02:28:23.564
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's already fucking happened and this </v>

3118
02:28:25.851 --> 02:28:30.560
<v Speaker 2>thing that we're in right now are alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of reincarnation is you die and</v>

3119
02:28:30.561 --> 02:28:34.160
<v Speaker 2>then you become a goat or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy like that larva slug,</v>

3120
02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:35.233
<v Speaker 2>but what if it's that you die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pop into that dmt realm and you get </v>

3121
02:28:39.471 --> 02:28:43.490
<v Speaker 2>to jump back into your life at any frame</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your life that you want to.</v>

3122
02:28:43.850 --> 02:28:46.580
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can actually repopulate your life or</v>

3123
02:28:46.581 --> 02:28:50.090
<v Speaker 2>reincarnate your life at any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you die.</v>

3124
02:28:50.091 --> 02:28:53.840
<v Speaker 2>You become the universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>superintelligence and then you gaze back</v>

3125
02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:54.913
<v Speaker 2>into what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and usually it's like in Buddhism they </v>

3126
02:28:56.961 --> 02:28:58.790
<v Speaker 2>say the cause of suffering is </v>
<v Speaker 2>attachment.</v>

3127
02:28:58.970 --> 02:29:01.820
<v Speaker 2>That that what you're attached to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

3128
02:29:01.821 --> 02:29:02.654
<v Speaker 2>this thing you just were this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>interdimensional temporal worm that </v>

3129
02:29:06.291 --> 02:29:09.170
<v Speaker 2>burrowed through time with every action </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you took and you're like,</v>

3130
02:29:10.020 --> 02:29:10.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you're just.</v>

3131
02:29:10.890 --> 02:29:11.511
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

3132
02:29:11.511 --> 02:29:12.344
<v Speaker 2>I want to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go back to this moment right </v>

3133
02:29:14.271 --> 02:29:15.104
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was podcasts when my pals doing a </v>

3134
02:29:16.761 --> 02:29:19.160
<v Speaker 2>shrimp parade and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you are.</v>

3135
02:29:19.161 --> 02:29:21.860
<v Speaker 2>You're back back in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in any given moment,</v>

3136
02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:25.730
<v Speaker 2>you could be reincarnating a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking times.</v>

3137
02:29:25.731 --> 02:29:26.564
<v Speaker 2>You could just be like always coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to any frame of your life that you </v>

3138
02:29:29.481 --> 02:29:30.950
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And anyway,</v>

3139
02:29:30.951 --> 02:29:32.360
<v Speaker 2>this is what came to me out there in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>desert.</v>

3140
02:29:32.361 --> 02:29:32.901
<v Speaker 2>And I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3141
02:29:32.901 --> 02:29:35.480
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you reincarnate into other</v>

3142
02:29:35.481 --> 02:29:38.210
<v Speaker 2>life forms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep repeating your life,</v>

3143
02:29:38.450 --> 02:29:41.480
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a circle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a spiral hopefully,</v>

3144
02:29:41.690 --> 02:29:44.300
<v Speaker 2>because each time you can improve a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit more,</v>

3145
02:29:44.510 --> 02:29:45.343
<v Speaker 2>you can improve a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make decisions that you normally </v>

3146
02:29:47.601 --> 02:29:48.710
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is why,</v>

3147
02:29:48.711 --> 02:29:49.544
<v Speaker 2>like at any given moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the big moments that come when </v>

3148
02:29:52.761 --> 02:29:55.850
<v Speaker 2>you're around somebody and you're about </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say some shitty fucking thing to,</v>

3149
02:29:55.851 --> 02:29:56.661
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3150
02:29:56.661 --> 02:29:59.810
<v Speaker 2>your enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your whoever it may be that moment where</v>

3151
02:29:59.811 --> 02:30:02.210
<v Speaker 2>you're like about to do the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing you always do.</v>

3152
02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:03.433
<v Speaker 2>And you can feel it like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel this gravitational pull to the </v>

3153
02:30:05.871 --> 02:30:08.270
<v Speaker 2>habituation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in that moment you're like,</v>

3154
02:30:08.330 --> 02:30:11.840
<v Speaker 2>you don't say the shitty thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that moment you discipline yourself,</v>

3155
02:30:11.841 --> 02:30:14.090
<v Speaker 2>you control yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't do the thing.</v>

3156
02:30:14.091 --> 02:30:16.760
<v Speaker 2>You've always done whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in that moment,</v>

3157
02:30:16.761 --> 02:30:20.960
<v Speaker 2>your life spirals up a little bit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're existing in like a completely</v>

3158
02:30:20.961 --> 02:30:24.720
<v Speaker 2>new new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like essentially a new universe plan.</v>

3159
02:30:24.860 --> 02:30:27.400
<v Speaker 2>What you hit a higher place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3160
02:30:27.410 --> 02:30:28.243
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of in a way that replicates </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you talk about sometimes on your </v>

3161
02:30:31.311 --> 02:30:32.990
<v Speaker 2>social media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see on your instagram,</v>

3162
02:30:33.380 --> 02:30:35.990
<v Speaker 2>like taming the inner bitch you have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3163
02:30:35.991 --> 02:30:36.950
<v Speaker 2>The other day he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3164
02:30:36.951 --> 02:30:39.160
<v Speaker 2>I really do not want to do this today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3165
02:30:39.161 --> 02:30:40.080
<v Speaker 2>you got up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3166
02:30:40.180 --> 02:30:42.650
<v Speaker 2>after you do the show the night before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3167
02:30:43.010 --> 02:30:44.630
<v Speaker 2>And you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the end of it,</v>

3168
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:49.700
<v Speaker 2>by doing that thing you didn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do or not doing the thing you do want to</v>

3169
02:30:49.701 --> 02:30:50.120
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

3170
02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:53.960
<v Speaker 2>Conversely you do move to a higher level</v>
<v Speaker 2>and feel way better use.</v>

3171
02:30:53.990 --> 02:30:54.741
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that.</v>

3172
02:30:54.741 --> 02:30:56.310
<v Speaker 2>So that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing you,</v>

3173
02:30:56.380 --> 02:30:57.830
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you instagrammed,</v>

3174
02:30:58.430 --> 02:30:59.263
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is super cool thing that </v>

3175
02:31:00.321 --> 02:31:04.010
<v Speaker 2>you do because I think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people need to like think,</v>

3176
02:31:04.011 --> 02:31:05.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could fucking.</v>

3177
02:31:05.060 --> 02:31:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Anytime I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could just start jogging and.</v>

3178
02:31:07.260 --> 02:31:10.460
<v Speaker 2>But it's like you could like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

3179
02:31:10.490 --> 02:31:13.040
<v Speaker 2>you just start doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have to be good at it.</v>

3180
02:31:13.290 --> 02:31:14.780
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could just make sure,</v>

3181
02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:17.300
<v Speaker 2>make sure you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just do that,</v>

3182
02:31:17.301 --> 02:31:19.890
<v Speaker 2>everything changes for the better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that seems easy.</v>

3183
02:31:19.891 --> 02:31:20.040
<v Speaker 2>It</v>

3184
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:20.873
<v Speaker 6>seems so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you need to hear people say it and </v>

3185
02:31:22.891 --> 02:31:25.260
<v Speaker 6>you need to hear someone say it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who actually does it?</v>

3186
02:31:25.290 --> 02:31:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that you know Rupert Sheldrake,</v>

3187
02:31:28.081 --> 02:31:29.850
<v Speaker 2>I think you might have had them on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3188
02:31:29.851 --> 02:31:30.361
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3189
02:31:30.361 --> 02:31:32.940
<v Speaker 2>So you know his idea of the Ronnell and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the timespace content,</v>

3190
02:31:32.980 --> 02:31:37.410
<v Speaker 2>he calls it a runnel basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that feeling when you're like,</v>

3191
02:31:37.411 --> 02:31:38.670
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to have a writing.</v>

3192
02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:40.880
<v Speaker 2>You're not just feeling your own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3193
02:31:41.010 --> 02:31:43.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of ambition or laziness.</v>

3194
02:31:43.470 --> 02:31:45.270
<v Speaker 2>You're literally feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now again,</v>

3195
02:31:45.450 --> 02:31:47.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe it's just like a thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment or whatever,</v>

3196
02:31:47.611 --> 02:31:52.611
<v Speaker 2>but you're literally feeling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravitational pull of infinite lifetimes</v>

3197
02:31:53.031 --> 02:31:55.230
<v Speaker 2>where in that moment you decided not to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go running.</v>

3198
02:31:55.231 --> 02:31:56.064
<v Speaker 2>You're actually feeling like the track </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've carved deep into the time </v>

3199
02:31:59.791 --> 02:32:03.630
<v Speaker 2>space continuum by every time that </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment appears you keep making,</v>

3200
02:32:03.780 --> 02:32:04.613
<v Speaker 2>so when you actually do go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go fucking running your </v>

3201
02:32:07.411 --> 02:32:08.244
<v Speaker 2>kind of climbing out of this trench that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've dug into time over countless </v>

3202
02:32:12.631 --> 02:32:16.020
<v Speaker 2>incarnations and when you do that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out there running,</v>

3203
02:32:16.530 --> 02:32:18.560
<v Speaker 2>you're like in a new dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're like,</v>

3204
02:32:18.580 --> 02:32:20.670
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the dimension where I decided to</v>

3205
02:32:20.671 --> 02:32:25.140
<v Speaker 2>go running and then that and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything starts changing a little bit.</v>

3206
02:32:25.141 --> 02:32:27.910
<v Speaker 2>When you make these decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big life changing moves.</v>

3207
02:32:28.490 --> 02:32:30.900
<v Speaker 2>Those are good for you and for some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people going out.</v>

3208
02:32:30.930 --> 02:32:31.763
<v Speaker 2>Jogging can be a life changing move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be some spectacular </v>

3209
02:32:35.551 --> 02:32:36.770
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be as simple as</v>

3210
02:32:37.220 --> 02:32:38.053
<v Speaker 6>taking a yoga class,</v>
<v Speaker 6>deciding to take a yoga class twice a </v>

3211
02:32:40.400 --> 02:32:41.990
<v Speaker 6>week or three times a week and change </v>
<v Speaker 6>your life.</v>

3212
02:32:42.020 --> 02:32:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Calling someone who you've said some </v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty thing too because they're.</v>

3213
02:32:47.240 --> 02:32:48.073
<v Speaker 2>They did something wrong and a Po and </v>
<v Speaker 2>being the bigger person apologizing </v>

3214
02:32:52.010 --> 02:32:55.430
<v Speaker 2>instead of holding that stupid garage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling them up and being like,</v>

3215
02:32:55.431 --> 02:32:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

3216
02:32:57.080 --> 02:32:59.210
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love you.</v>

3217
02:32:59.211 --> 02:33:00.044
<v Speaker 2>You're great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of like carrying on with this </v>

3218
02:33:02.270 --> 02:33:06.380
<v Speaker 2>stupid angry war carousel and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>carousel.</v>

3219
02:33:06.560 --> 02:33:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you make decisions like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things get better so fast and then like,</v>

3220
02:33:11.751 --> 02:33:13.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've noticed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3221
02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:14.353
<v Speaker 2>I've noticed like synchronicities start </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening more like good luck starts </v>

3222
02:33:17.481 --> 02:33:18.314
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More like interesting things start </v>

3223
02:33:20.121 --> 02:33:20.680
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

3224
02:33:20.680 --> 02:33:21.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you,</v>

3225
02:33:21.701 --> 02:33:22.534
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

3226
02:33:22.750 --> 02:33:27.280
<v Speaker 6>we fight against ourselves sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 6>accidentally liked me when I was young.</v>

3227
02:33:27.610 --> 02:33:28.443
<v Speaker 6>When I was young I would have an </v>
<v Speaker 6>interaction with someone and then I </v>

3228
02:33:30.401 --> 02:33:31.234
<v Speaker 6>would always imagine what they were </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to say when we talked again and </v>

3229
02:33:34.331 --> 02:33:35.164
<v Speaker 6>then I would imagine me talking shit to </v>
<v Speaker 6>them and that I would imagine then </v>

3230
02:33:38.771 --> 02:33:41.920
<v Speaker 6>getting upset at me and having a </v>
<v Speaker 6>delusional perspective.</v>

3231
02:33:41.921 --> 02:33:45.460
<v Speaker 6>I would like play out this weird play in</v>
<v Speaker 6>my mind.</v>

3232
02:33:45.461 --> 02:33:46.294
<v Speaker 6>I'm on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then when I was in my twenties I </v>

3233
02:33:48.041 --> 02:33:49.990
<v Speaker 6>started to realize how preposterous it </v>
<v Speaker 6>was.</v>

3234
02:33:50.020 --> 02:33:50.853
<v Speaker 6>Took me that long and I realized like </v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm wasting all this time and I didn't </v>

3235
02:33:55.181 --> 02:33:57.360
<v Speaker 6>realize it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't realize other people did.</v>

3236
02:33:57.510 --> 02:34:00.280
<v Speaker 6>I talked to my friend Brian once and he </v>
<v Speaker 6>was saying the same thing.</v>

3237
02:34:00.340 --> 02:34:01.173
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have arguments with people that </v>

3238
02:34:01.931 --> 02:34:03.280
<v Speaker 6>aren't there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It goes all the fucking time,</v>

3239
02:34:03.730 --> 02:34:04.563
<v Speaker 6>all the fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have arguments in my head with people </v>

3240
02:34:06.071 --> 02:34:06.904
<v Speaker 6>that were there that's like sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll have a conversation with someone </v>

3241
02:34:08.501 --> 02:34:09.334
<v Speaker 6>about something and then you both </v>
<v Speaker 6>immediately are like relieved and start </v>

3242
02:34:11.861 --> 02:34:12.694
<v Speaker 6>laughing because you were both expecting</v>
<v Speaker 6>the other person to be like Super Mad </v>

3243
02:34:15.791 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 6>and come in like an asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but meanwhile you're both</v>

3244
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:22.090
<v Speaker 8>apologize and then it just goes away and</v>
<v Speaker 8>then everybody feels way better.</v>

3245
02:34:22.091 --> 02:34:25.180
<v Speaker 8>A better way.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Better like conflict is stupid.</v>

3246
02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:30.300
<v Speaker 8>What's not stupid is exercising out all </v>
<v Speaker 8>the anxiety that your body possesses,</v>

3247
02:34:31.151 --> 02:34:33.580
<v Speaker 8>that it creates conflict in the first </v>
<v Speaker 8>place.</v>

3248
02:34:33.730 --> 02:34:34.563
<v Speaker 8>Whether it's exercising it through </v>
<v Speaker 8>meditation or through taking a yoga </v>

3249
02:34:37.511 --> 02:34:38.344
<v Speaker 8>class or doing something physical.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That just gives you some relief of </v>

3250
02:34:41.261 --> 02:34:44.200
<v Speaker 8>stress because you exert yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't have to be anything crazy.</v>

3251
02:34:44.201 --> 02:34:46.900
<v Speaker 8>Fucking going on a nice hike.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You go on a nice hike,</v>

3252
02:34:46.901 --> 02:34:50.080
<v Speaker 8>you get to see things and you feel </v>
<v Speaker 8>better like you're walking.</v>

3253
02:34:50.081 --> 02:34:52.120
<v Speaker 8>The blood starts pumping through your </v>
<v Speaker 8>brain.</v>

3254
02:34:52.390 --> 02:34:54.370
<v Speaker 8>You come up with great ideas when you </v>
<v Speaker 8>hike,</v>

3255
02:34:54.670 --> 02:34:55.503
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's like all these things are just </v>

3256
02:34:56.530 --> 02:34:57.363
<v Speaker 8>little incremental steps at every one of</v>
<v Speaker 8>us can take and you do that and it </v>

3257
02:35:00.521 --> 02:35:02.440
<v Speaker 8>changes everything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then you be nicer,</v>

3258
02:35:02.470 --> 02:35:03.970
<v Speaker 8>nicer to people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That changes everything too.</v>

3259
02:35:04.330 --> 02:35:08.350
<v Speaker 8>And it helps you to be nicer if you have</v>
<v Speaker 8>control of your physical body.</v>

3260
02:35:08.410 --> 02:35:09.720
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3261
02:35:09.730 --> 02:35:10.563
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3262
02:35:10.570 --> 02:35:12.130
<v Speaker 2>the question that we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>

3263
02:35:12.131 --> 02:35:12.964
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck do we do about the </v>

3264
02:35:13.541 --> 02:35:15.970
<v Speaker 2>lunatics out there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3265
02:35:15.971 --> 02:35:16.781
<v Speaker 2>what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3266
02:35:16.781 --> 02:35:17.650
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3267
02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:18.753
<v Speaker 2>if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start with a fucking lunatic that </v>

3268
02:35:21.431 --> 02:35:26.431
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting in right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you do.</v>

3269
02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lunatic.</v>

3270
02:35:30.030 --> 02:35:30.970
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

3271
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:31.661
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3272
02:35:31.661 --> 02:35:32.351
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

3273
02:35:32.351 --> 02:35:32.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3274
02:35:32.890 --> 02:35:35.580
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what Rom da says is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3275
02:35:35.830 --> 02:35:38.560
<v Speaker 2>we work on ourselves so we can help the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people next to us.</v>

3276
02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:41.530
<v Speaker 2>And that's all you can do because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't do shit,</v>

3277
02:35:41.531 --> 02:35:43.150
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make another person.</v>

3278
02:35:43.390 --> 02:35:46.510
<v Speaker 2>You're not really gonna do much to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people around you.</v>

3279
02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:48.550
<v Speaker 2>They're going to do their own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to decide.</v>

3280
02:35:48.910 --> 02:35:49.743
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is something I've been thinking </v>

3281
02:35:51.790 --> 02:35:52.623
<v Speaker 2>fucking Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of people talk about </v>

3282
02:35:54.941 --> 02:35:55.774
<v Speaker 2>miracles and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially like in the camps I hang out </v>

3283
02:35:58.120 --> 02:35:59.650
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Duncan says,</v>

3284
02:35:59.830 --> 02:36:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking about fucking Jesus.</v>

3285
02:36:04.510 --> 02:36:05.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

3286
02:36:05.710 --> 02:36:08.170
<v Speaker 2>That's freaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a different thing.</v>

3287
02:36:08.171 --> 02:36:10.620
<v Speaker 2>Fucking fucking Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3288
02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:11.553
<v Speaker 2>I would totally do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different thing that you've </v>

3289
02:36:12.971 --> 02:36:14.890
<v Speaker 2>already done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do DMT,</v>

3290
02:36:15.170 --> 02:36:16.570
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's part of the experience.</v>

3291
02:36:16.571 --> 02:36:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Making Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having intercourse with the Christ.</v>

3292
02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:21.910
<v Speaker 2>It would be an honor through all pours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be an honor.</v>

3293
02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:25.720
<v Speaker 2>You go together like you just merge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just merged.</v>

3294
02:36:25.721 --> 02:36:26.554
<v Speaker 2>You just merge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're on your knees again at the video </v>

3295
02:36:28.571 --> 02:36:29.410
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>

3296
02:36:29.411 --> 02:36:31.780
<v Speaker 2>it's always dirty with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she never be just psychedelic,</v>

3297
02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:37.430
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic love about Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just be on your knees choking on Christ.</v>

3298
02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:38.273
<v Speaker 2>Come or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can guarantee you can guarantee </v>

3299
02:36:43.060 --> 02:36:45.500
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be a semi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A sex simulator for sure.</v>

3300
02:36:45.620 --> 02:36:47.420
<v Speaker 2>My to Christ there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

3301
02:36:48.070 --> 02:36:50.290
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of the Virgin Mary.</v>

3302
02:36:50.740 --> 02:36:52.000
<v Speaker 2>She was hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people,</v>

3303
02:36:52.001 --> 02:36:54.790
<v Speaker 2>they talk about mirrors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice guys.</v>

3304
02:36:54.791 --> 02:36:55.624
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to talk about fucking </v>

3305
02:36:56.620 --> 02:36:57.490
<v Speaker 2>miracles here.</v>

3306
02:36:57.850 --> 02:36:58.683
<v Speaker 2>So I know these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk about miracles that bunch and </v>

3307
02:37:08.621 --> 02:37:09.341
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3308
02:37:09.341 --> 02:37:13.210
<v Speaker 2>having seen some of these fucking gurus </v>
<v Speaker 2>do crazy shit,</v>

3309
02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:14.343
<v Speaker 2>but they always say it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like ultimately these are dishes like </v>

3310
02:37:18.081 --> 02:37:19.220
<v Speaker 2>fireworks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of.</v>

3311
02:37:19.221 --> 02:37:20.720
<v Speaker 2>It's just like tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a firework.</v>

3312
02:37:20.721 --> 02:37:21.554
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't because like the thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you could sit in front of someone </v>

3313
02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:27.620
<v Speaker 2>and like levitate bottles in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

3314
02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:31.100
<v Speaker 2>like levitate a bunch of bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teleport across the room,</v>

3315
02:37:31.130 --> 02:37:33.710
<v Speaker 2>come back and then tell the person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3316
02:37:33.711 --> 02:37:35.780
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be a lot happier if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>go jogging.</v>

3317
02:37:36.260 --> 02:37:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Like someone could do that to me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow I'm gonna wake up.</v>

3318
02:37:39.500 --> 02:37:40.101
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3319
02:37:40.101 --> 02:37:43.100
<v Speaker 2>he levitated bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He poured across the room.</v>

3320
02:37:43.101 --> 02:37:46.870
<v Speaker 2>They told me I should go jogging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably go tomorrow.</v>

3321
02:37:47.410 --> 02:37:49.350
<v Speaker 2>No fucking jogging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

3322
02:37:49.590 --> 02:37:52.990
<v Speaker 2>They don't care the liver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

3323
02:37:54.890 --> 02:37:56.120
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

3324
02:37:56.480 --> 02:37:58.810
<v Speaker 2>None of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of the point is like if.</v>

3325
02:37:58.820 --> 02:38:01.810
<v Speaker 2>So if a person who can levitate bottles </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably isn't gonna,</v>

3326
02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:02.663
<v Speaker 2>make you go jogging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then certainly you're not going to be </v>

3327
02:38:05.211 --> 02:38:07.190
<v Speaker 2>able to talk to a person and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3328
02:38:07.191 --> 02:38:09.080
<v Speaker 2>you know you're going to feel better if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do this,</v>

3329
02:38:09.530 --> 02:38:13.010
<v Speaker 2>you all you can really do is look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and be like,</v>

3330
02:38:13.011 --> 02:38:15.410
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna go fucking jogging.</v>

3331
02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:16.800
<v Speaker 8>This is a really good point.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What is,</v>

3332
02:38:16.830 --> 02:38:20.580
<v Speaker 8>what's your take on this in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 8>like the miracles in the Bible?</v>

3333
02:38:20.581 --> 02:38:23.280
<v Speaker 8>Like some of the weirder ones like </v>
<v Speaker 8>walking on water,</v>

3334
02:38:23.580 --> 02:38:25.980
<v Speaker 8>like what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 8>What do you think that's about?</v>

3335
02:38:25.981 --> 02:38:26.814
<v Speaker 8>What do you think like the.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Even though the interpretation of those </v>

3336
02:38:29.011 --> 02:38:30.120
<v Speaker 8>is kind of suspect,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

3337
02:38:30.121 --> 02:38:33.660
<v Speaker 8>Like what isn't the walking on water is </v>
<v Speaker 8>a weird one because I think it has to do</v>

3338
02:38:33.661 --> 02:38:34.494
<v Speaker 8>with translation and I think that it </v>
<v Speaker 8>could be interpreted in other languages </v>

3339
02:38:38.821 --> 02:38:39.654
<v Speaker 8>walking by the water,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like walking near the water could be </v>

3340
02:38:42.961 --> 02:38:45.990
<v Speaker 8>thought of as levitating and walking on </v>
<v Speaker 8>water polo and the preposition.</v>

3341
02:38:45.991 --> 02:38:46.561
<v Speaker 8>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3342
02:38:46.561 --> 02:38:47.394
<v Speaker 8>It's so hard when you're going from </v>
<v Speaker 8>ancient Hebrew and Aramaic and all this </v>

3343
02:38:50.551 --> 02:38:52.470
<v Speaker 8>different shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But do you think that this,</v>

3344
02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:56.970
<v Speaker 8>what you're saying is that someone would</v>
<v Speaker 8>do tricks to get you to listen to them,</v>

3345
02:38:57.390 --> 02:39:02.230
<v Speaker 8>like you levitate things or walk on </v>
<v Speaker 8>water or turn water into wine minds?</v>

3346
02:39:02.700 --> 02:39:05.640
<v Speaker 8>Moses splits the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like what?</v>

3347
02:39:06.180 --> 02:39:06.980
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3348
02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:09.120
<v Speaker 8>I used to have a bit about that where it</v>
<v Speaker 8>was like,</v>

3349
02:39:09.121 --> 02:39:11.730
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like there'd be like 100 people standing</v>

3350
02:39:11.731 --> 02:39:13.710
<v Speaker 8>behind him going,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how long can you hold that?</v>

3351
02:39:14.490 --> 02:39:16.110
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what the fuck is he doing?</v>

3352
02:39:16.350 --> 02:39:17.320
<v Speaker 8>Like why do you split the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

3353
02:39:17.321 --> 02:39:19.930
<v Speaker 8>we have to walk across that because </v>
<v Speaker 8>that's going to take dates.</v>

3354
02:39:21.030 --> 02:39:22.470
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how's he doing that magic.</v>

3355
02:39:22.770 --> 02:39:25.980
<v Speaker 8>Tell that silly motherfucker uses magic </v>
<v Speaker 8>and make us a boat.</v>

3356
02:39:26.530 --> 02:39:31.530
<v Speaker 8>It's crazy walking a mile high of on one</v>
<v Speaker 8>side or the other.</v>

3357
02:39:32.370 --> 02:39:33.203
<v Speaker 8>You just walking through the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just fucking dead fish flopping around </v>

3358
02:39:35.641 --> 02:39:38.280
<v Speaker 8>in the middle walls of water on either </v>
<v Speaker 8>side.</v>

3359
02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very humid.</v>

3360
02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

3361
02:39:40.870 --> 02:39:41.703
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>

3362
02:39:41.710 --> 02:39:42.543
<v Speaker 2>that's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3363
02:39:42.550 --> 02:39:46.060
<v Speaker 2>that's literal interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that's way deeper than.</v>

3364
02:39:46.061 --> 02:39:48.740
<v Speaker 2>That adds a lot of deeper meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a,</v>

3365
02:39:48.810 --> 02:39:49.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

3366
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:50.663
<v Speaker 2>it's a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're using these encoded stories to </v>

3367
02:39:53.231 --> 02:39:54.064
<v Speaker 2>try to get across something that's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger and it's isn't about really </v>

3368
02:39:58.751 --> 02:40:00.170
<v Speaker 2>walking on water maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3369
02:40:00.171 --> 02:40:00.220
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3370
02:40:00.220 --> 02:40:01.053
<v Speaker 8>but I think that these showing that the </v>
<v Speaker 8>people that had all this knowledge also </v>

3371
02:40:04.841 --> 02:40:05.674
<v Speaker 8>had magic tricks is very telling.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like the people that everybody would </v>

3372
02:40:09.611 --> 02:40:10.400
<v Speaker 8>follow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They were.</v>

3373
02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:13.200
<v Speaker 8>They were able to do things right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

3374
02:40:13.230 --> 02:40:17.760
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how about the guy who I'm called upon a.</v>

3375
02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:22.500
<v Speaker 8>She bear to kill these kids that were </v>
<v Speaker 8>mocking him for being bald.</v>

3376
02:40:23.070 --> 02:40:25.100
<v Speaker 8>That's a story that's in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3377
02:40:25.110 --> 02:40:25.561
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

3378
02:40:25.561 --> 02:40:27.540
<v Speaker 8>There was a man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I forget his name.</v>

3379
02:40:27.970 --> 02:40:30.990
<v Speaker 8>You can find that story.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He called a upon a.</v>

3380
02:40:30.991 --> 02:40:31.824
<v Speaker 8>She bear and God brought down a sheet </v>
<v Speaker 8>bear to smite these children that were </v>

3381
02:40:36.031 --> 02:40:37.410
<v Speaker 8>making fun of is balding.</v>

3382
02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:41.040
<v Speaker 8>She asked,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

3383
02:40:41.041 --> 02:40:43.020
<v Speaker 8>I think it was a female bear.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They would.</v>

3384
02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:46.350
<v Speaker 8>They would do cold.</v>
<v Speaker 8>She bare back then to today,</v>

3385
02:40:46.390 --> 02:40:49.380
<v Speaker 8>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I guess we'd call it a sow sow bear,</v>

3386
02:40:49.570 --> 02:40:50.403
<v Speaker 8>but that this bear killed the kids </v>
<v Speaker 8>because they were making fun of him for </v>

3387
02:40:52.711 --> 02:40:53.820
<v Speaker 8>being,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for being bald.</v>

3388
02:40:54.330 --> 02:40:55.650
<v Speaker 8>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

3389
02:40:55.850 --> 02:40:56.970
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there again,</v>

3390
02:40:56.971 --> 02:40:57.804
<v Speaker 8>you have to listen to this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's got magic is able to conjure up </v>

3391
02:41:01.890 --> 02:41:04.260
<v Speaker 8>from the forest to kill mocking </v>
<v Speaker 8>children.</v>

3392
02:41:04.290 --> 02:41:05.790
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They walk on water.</v>

3393
02:41:05.791 --> 02:41:06.624
<v Speaker 8>They turned water into wine here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why did God killed 42 lads merely for </v>

3394
02:41:10.321 --> 02:41:11.610
<v Speaker 8>saying Alicia was bald?</v>

3395
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:15.920
<v Speaker 7>Forty two lads.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That makes it worse.</v>

3396
02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:19.990
<v Speaker 7>Friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Or let's read the verse.</v>

3397
02:41:20.020 --> 02:41:21.610
<v Speaker 7>Then he went up from there to backfill.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anyways,</v>

3398
02:41:21.700 --> 02:41:23.050
<v Speaker 7>going up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>by the way,</v>

3399
02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:26.200
<v Speaker 7>young lads came out from the city and </v>
<v Speaker 7>mocked him and said,</v>

3400
02:41:26.230 --> 02:41:27.640
<v Speaker 7>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 7>go app your bald.</v>

3401
02:41:27.641 --> 02:41:29.730
<v Speaker 7>Head Up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You bought it.</v>

3402
02:41:30.220 --> 02:41:34.150
<v Speaker 7>When he looked behind him and saw them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he cursed them in the name of the Lord.</v>

3403
02:41:34.151 --> 02:41:36.250
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't say what he says in all caps </v>
<v Speaker 7>too,</v>

3404
02:41:36.251 --> 02:41:38.070
<v Speaker 7>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like it's fucking twitter account.</v>

3405
02:41:38.290 --> 02:41:40.180
<v Speaker 7>Tooth then to feet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3406
02:41:40.181 --> 02:41:42.220
<v Speaker 7>Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 7>God.</v>

3407
02:41:42.250 --> 02:41:43.083
<v Speaker 7>Then to female bears,</v>
<v Speaker 7>came out of the woods and tore up 42 </v>

3408
02:41:47.201 --> 02:41:51.080
<v Speaker 7>lads have their number.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought it was too too.</v>

3409
02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:56.400
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It knows to bears either one.</v>

3410
02:41:56.861 --> 02:41:58.410
<v Speaker 7>She bear weight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is this?</v>

3411
02:41:58.430 --> 02:42:02.560
<v Speaker 7>So this is like actually exploring this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why would God allow two bears to kill 42</v>

3412
02:42:02.561 --> 02:42:03.394
<v Speaker 7>young black,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it's written by a guy named Matt </v>

3413
02:42:06.210 --> 02:42:07.043
<v Speaker 7>Slick,</v>

3414
02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:10.170
<v Speaker 8>probably doing porn right now,</v>
<v Speaker 8>red liquid.</v>

3415
02:42:10.171 --> 02:42:11.880
<v Speaker 8>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let's take a look.</v>

3416
02:42:11.910 --> 02:42:13.520
<v Speaker 8>Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You ain't taking nothing.</v>

3417
02:42:13.560 --> 02:42:14.393
<v Speaker 8>You're just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Alicia was traveling from Jericho to </v>

3418
02:42:16.921 --> 02:42:19.530
<v Speaker 8>Bethel when a group of young men </v>
<v Speaker 8>verbally accosted him.</v>

3419
02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:23.220
<v Speaker 8>A 42 is a large number of people and </v>
<v Speaker 8>they were probably an organized group,</v>

3420
02:42:23.350 --> 02:42:24.183
<v Speaker 8>gone out to challenge the La show.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Their mockery implied a militia to a </v>

3421
02:42:27.980 --> 02:42:28.813
<v Speaker 8>malicious intent,</v>
<v Speaker 8>especially when the culture of the time </v>

3422
02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:32.940
<v Speaker 8>insisted on showing respect to their </v>
<v Speaker 8>elders.</v>

3423
02:42:33.060 --> 02:42:35.070
<v Speaker 8>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the statement go up.</v>

3424
02:42:35.071 --> 02:42:38.700
<v Speaker 8>You bald head has cultural significance.</v>
<v Speaker 8>First of all,</v>

3425
02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:39.593
<v Speaker 8>go up in parenthesis is a probably a </v>
<v Speaker 8>reference to a licensed predecessor </v>

3426
02:42:44.730 --> 02:42:47.700
<v Speaker 8>Alijah ascending to heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In other words,</v>

3427
02:42:47.870 --> 02:42:50.340
<v Speaker 8>they are stating that when Elijah got,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

3428
02:42:50.341 --> 02:42:51.540
<v Speaker 8>they want to lie Shangaan,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

3429
02:42:51.610 --> 02:42:54.750
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is just so ridiculously intense.</v>

3430
02:42:54.780 --> 02:42:55.613
<v Speaker 8>Elijah had gone on to the next world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The implication is they wanted </v>

3431
02:42:58.510 --> 02:43:00.450
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible] dead.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Also,</v>

3432
02:43:00.451 --> 02:43:01.284
<v Speaker 8>the epitaph,</v>
<v Speaker 8>bald head was one of contempt in the </v>

3433
02:43:03.691 --> 02:43:08.040
<v Speaker 8>east end.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Quotes apply to a person who,</v>

3434
02:43:08.100 --> 02:43:08.933
<v Speaker 8>a person,</v>
<v Speaker 8>even with a bushy head of hair lepers </v>

3435
02:43:11.711 --> 02:43:12.280
<v Speaker 8>had to shave</v>

3436
02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:13.540
<v Speaker 1>their heads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is such a statement,</v>

3437
02:43:13.541 --> 02:43:16.030
<v Speaker 1>could easily have been deliberate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>malicious insult,</v>

3438
02:43:16.031 --> 02:43:17.110
<v Speaker 1>something dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

3439
02:43:17.770 --> 02:43:18.603
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's such a weird interpretation of </v>

3440
02:43:21.161 --> 02:43:24.430
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either way you sent bears to kill people</v>

3441
02:43:24.431 --> 02:43:25.264
<v Speaker 1>for marketing your fucking head because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying it's okay if they were </v>

3442
02:43:28.181 --> 02:43:31.690
<v Speaker 1>being disrespectful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that God would just call some bears.</v>

3443
02:43:31.770 --> 02:43:35.010
<v Speaker 1>That this is the weirdest sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>justification for attack by,</v>

3444
02:43:35.290 --> 02:43:36.123
<v Speaker 1>by wild beasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The creator of the universe is using a </v>

3445
02:43:39.461 --> 02:43:42.190
<v Speaker 1>wild beast to attack because someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt with words.</v>

3446
02:43:42.530 --> 02:43:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Have you read the book of Job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing since I was like,</v>

3447
02:43:45.971 --> 02:43:47.530
<v Speaker 1>it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a whopper men.</v>

3448
02:43:47.560 --> 02:43:50.860
<v Speaker 1>So it's the story of this Guy Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's like prosperous.</v>

3449
02:43:50.861 --> 02:43:52.330
<v Speaker 1>He's in love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's married,</v>

3450
02:43:52.331 --> 02:43:53.164
<v Speaker 1>he has three children and lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and land and everything's going </v>

3451
02:43:56.231 --> 02:43:57.064
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so up in heaven or in wherever they </v>

3452
02:43:59.471 --> 02:44:00.304
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God and the devil are having a </v>

3453
02:44:02.261 --> 02:44:06.520
<v Speaker 1>conversation and God is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at how great I am,</v>

3454
02:44:06.521 --> 02:44:07.750
<v Speaker 1>how everyone loves me.</v>

3455
02:44:07.750 --> 02:44:08.780
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at Joe.</v>

3456
02:44:08.781 --> 02:44:11.170
<v Speaker 1>He loves me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He worships all the time and all that,</v>

3457
02:44:11.171 --> 02:44:12.004
<v Speaker 1>and the devil says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course he does because his life so </v>

3458
02:44:13.841 --> 02:44:18.040
<v Speaker 1>good take away is a sheep and see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he says.</v>

3459
02:44:18.520 --> 02:44:20.680
<v Speaker 1>And God's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

3460
02:44:20.740 --> 02:44:21.573
<v Speaker 1>so he kills all job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sheep and job goes to church and </v>

3461
02:44:23.981 --> 02:44:26.380
<v Speaker 1>worships and no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the devil's lake.</v>

3462
02:44:26.410 --> 02:44:27.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you took away the cows and the </v>

3463
02:44:29.021 --> 02:44:30.520
<v Speaker 1>land there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'd see.</v>

3464
02:44:30.910 --> 02:44:31.743
<v Speaker 1>So God goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes away the cows and the land and </v>

3465
02:44:33.251 --> 02:44:37.570
<v Speaker 1>it goes on and on until job is totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>destitute.</v>

3466
02:44:37.660 --> 02:44:42.660
<v Speaker 1>All of his family is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sitting on an ash heap with boils all</v>

3467
02:44:42.671 --> 02:44:45.760
<v Speaker 1>over his body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how far God was willing to go,</v>

3468
02:44:45.761 --> 02:44:49.420
<v Speaker 1>to prove a point to the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

3469
02:44:49.510 --> 02:44:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Remember that part?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't.</v>

3470
02:44:50.860 --> 02:44:55.860
<v Speaker 1>He continued to love God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy story.</v>

3471
02:44:57.460 --> 02:44:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just finish.</v>

3472
02:44:58.650 --> 02:45:01.600
<v Speaker 1>So then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then God wins the bet.</v>

3473
02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:02.913
<v Speaker 1>Whereas tortured this dude and he gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>back twice as much as everything to job </v>

3474
02:45:08.740 --> 02:45:09.573
<v Speaker 1>to reward him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now he has 400 sheep and one in six </v>

3475
02:45:13.841 --> 02:45:15.710
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like.</v>

3476
02:45:15.850 --> 02:45:18.610
<v Speaker 1>So it didn't matter who those children </v>
<v Speaker 1>were that you killed.</v>

3477
02:45:18.790 --> 02:45:20.860
<v Speaker 1>And the wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just give them another wife and more</v>

3478
02:45:20.861 --> 02:45:21.790
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're better.</v>

3479
02:45:22.290 --> 02:45:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Maybe had a little time machine spun it </v>
<v Speaker 1>all back.</v>

3480
02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean he did create the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could do whatever the fuck you want.</v>

3481
02:45:28.180 --> 02:45:30.250
<v Speaker 1>That is kind of like the part in job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

3482
02:45:30.370 --> 02:45:31.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally.</v>

3483
02:45:31.541 --> 02:45:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking ridiculous.</v>

3484
02:45:33.461 --> 02:45:34.294
<v Speaker 1>But it's not supposed to be stories that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are meant to like encompass the human </v>

3485
02:45:38.621 --> 02:45:41.440
<v Speaker 1>predicament and like one of the cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in there isn't there?</v>

3486
02:45:41.441 --> 02:45:42.274
<v Speaker 1>This great line where job is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>questioning why he would job is </v>

3487
02:45:45.521 --> 02:45:47.310
<v Speaker 1>questioning him too or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said something.</v>

3488
02:45:47.410 --> 02:45:48.071
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3489
02:45:48.071 --> 02:45:49.340
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get into an argument.</v>

3490
02:45:49.700 --> 02:45:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Response is something like I created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3491
02:45:51.790 --> 02:45:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Where were you when I created the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavens and the earth?</v>

3492
02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:58.930
<v Speaker 1>And this is again man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking tone.</v>

3493
02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:00.273
<v Speaker 1>And at this debt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tribal desert religion is really </v>

3494
02:46:03.641 --> 02:46:06.850
<v Speaker 1>harsh and patriarchal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the message behind it,</v>

3495
02:46:07.540 --> 02:46:09.740
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bhagavad Gita,</v>

3496
02:46:09.741 --> 02:46:10.000
<v Speaker 1>which is</v>

3497
02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:10.833
<v Speaker 7>just a fucking battlefield where Krishna</v>
<v Speaker 7>turns into that universal form is the </v>

3498
02:46:16.941 --> 02:46:19.930
<v Speaker 7>quote ob Oppenheimer's quote,</v>
<v Speaker 7>behold,</v>

3499
02:46:19.940 --> 02:46:23.600
<v Speaker 7>I have become damn become the destroyer </v>
<v Speaker 7>of worlds.</v>

3500
02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:25.760
<v Speaker 7>And so it's a similar thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Both of these are saying,</v>

3501
02:46:25.820 --> 02:46:29.180
<v Speaker 7>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>tiny little human thing all caught up in</v>

3502
02:46:29.181 --> 02:46:32.720
<v Speaker 7>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so fixated on everything about you.</v>

3503
02:46:33.170 --> 02:46:36.980
<v Speaker 7>You exist within the infinite span of </v>
<v Speaker 7>time.</v>

3504
02:46:37.370 --> 02:46:38.203
<v Speaker 7>A Big Bang to go with something like we </v>
<v Speaker 7>were saying longer than 13 point 7 </v>

3505
02:46:42.380 --> 02:46:43.580
<v Speaker 7>billion years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You tiny,</v>

3506
02:46:43.581 --> 02:46:44.414
<v Speaker 7>tiny little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You exist in something so infinitely </v>

3507
02:46:48.111 --> 02:46:51.980
<v Speaker 7>gigantic and beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What do you think you control?</v>

3508
02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:55.640
<v Speaker 7>What do you think you really control?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't control shit.</v>

3509
02:46:55.850 --> 02:46:59.660
<v Speaker 7>You don't control anything,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so that's what they really.</v>

3510
02:46:59.661 --> 02:47:00.494
<v Speaker 7>It's more of like when when we </v>
<v Speaker 7>experienced inevitable catastrophe in </v>

3511
02:47:03.111 --> 02:47:05.930
<v Speaker 7>our lives and we're looking around and </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

3512
02:47:05.931 --> 02:47:07.130
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

3513
02:47:07.460 --> 02:47:08.293
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck's wrong with the universe?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like nothing's wrong with the </v>

3514
02:47:11.361 --> 02:47:13.400
<v Speaker 7>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nothing's wrong with you.</v>

3515
02:47:14.030 --> 02:47:15.320
<v Speaker 7>Nothing's wrong with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In fact,</v>

3516
02:47:15.321 --> 02:47:17.570
<v Speaker 7>everything's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just surrender to it.</v>

3517
02:47:17.810 --> 02:47:21.620
<v Speaker 7>Even if you're sitting in the goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 7>ash pile covered in boils,</v>

3518
02:47:21.950 --> 02:47:25.790
<v Speaker 7>if you just let go and surrender and </v>
<v Speaker 7>drop the bitterness,</v>

3519
02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:28.160
<v Speaker 7>then you can.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If nothing else,</v>

3520
02:47:28.161 --> 02:47:32.210
<v Speaker 7>not suffer under the terrible weight of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the resistance or feeling like a victim.</v>

3521
02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:34.130
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to me what I get at a job,</v>

3522
02:47:34.131 --> 02:47:35.890
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>from the non literal level,</v>

3523
02:47:35.910 --> 02:47:38.780
<v Speaker 7>the literal level.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like God's hanging out with Satan,</v>

3524
02:47:39.230 --> 02:47:40.590
<v Speaker 7>so they played poker and shit.</v>

3525
02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:41.473
<v Speaker 8>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like he just drops by like Satan </v>

3526
02:47:45.471 --> 02:47:48.970
<v Speaker 8>sometimes just pops by wherever God </v>
<v Speaker 8>lives and they make bets.</v>

3527
02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:50.690
<v Speaker 8>They make beds.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's ridiculous,</v>

3528
02:47:50.810 --> 02:47:54.860
<v Speaker 8>but it will suffer for God's bet like </v>
<v Speaker 8>fear factor when you think about it.</v>

3529
02:47:54.861 --> 02:47:56.160
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you got paid for Fairfax.</v>

3530
02:47:57.520 --> 02:47:58.500
<v Speaker 8>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you.</v>

3531
02:47:58.510 --> 02:48:02.870
<v Speaker 8>When you made $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 8>job,</v>

3532
02:48:03.140 --> 02:48:03.973
<v Speaker 8>the government takes a piece out of </v>
<v Speaker 8>someone winning naked and afraid or any </v>

3533
02:48:06.651 --> 02:48:08.390
<v Speaker 8>of those shows.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Government takes piece.</v>

3534
02:48:08.420 --> 02:48:10.970
<v Speaker 8>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're out there choking on bug.</v>

3535
02:48:10.990 --> 02:48:11.823
<v Speaker 8>Dick's trying to make banana hammock out</v>
<v Speaker 8>of literal banana leaves for Dick by </v>

3536
02:48:19.340 --> 02:48:22.040
<v Speaker 8>love or biting you everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's so ridiculous.</v>

3537
02:48:22.041 --> 02:48:24.350
<v Speaker 8>Those shows are so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's amazing.</v>

3538
02:48:24.351 --> 02:48:26.250
<v Speaker 8>They haven't killed anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It is Kong.</v>

3539
02:48:26.300 --> 02:48:29.180
<v Speaker 8>How come nobody's gotten bitten by </v>
<v Speaker 8>spiders and died or some shit?</v>

3540
02:48:29.540 --> 02:48:32.180
<v Speaker 8>Some people get super sick on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah.</v>

3541
02:48:32.181 --> 02:48:34.850
<v Speaker 8>Well they eat fucked up things.</v>
<v Speaker 8>By the way,</v>

3542
02:48:34.910 --> 02:48:37.790
<v Speaker 8>some of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you eat things and don't cook them,</v>

3543
02:48:38.060 --> 02:48:40.010
<v Speaker 8>those parasites can stay with you </v>
<v Speaker 8>forever,</v>

3544
02:48:40.610 --> 02:48:41.900
<v Speaker 8>so I don't do Sushi.</v>

3545
02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:47.800
<v Speaker 8>Sushi is not bad if you get ocean Sushi,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I've been told not to eat salmon.</v>

3546
02:48:48.410 --> 02:48:49.550
<v Speaker 8>I've been told,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

3547
02:48:49.551 --> 02:48:51.590
<v Speaker 8>someone said that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Freshwater Salmon.</v>

3548
02:48:51.830 --> 02:48:54.580
<v Speaker 8>The problem is salmon is a freshwater </v>
<v Speaker 8>fish as well.</v>

3549
02:48:54.730 --> 02:48:57.470
<v Speaker 8>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they migrate to go to the ocean and they</v>

3550
02:48:57.500 --> 02:48:58.333
<v Speaker 8>go and they're susceptible to some </v>
<v Speaker 8>parasites apparently that a tuna and a </v>

3551
02:49:03.111 --> 02:49:07.530
<v Speaker 8>lot of ocean born fish isn't susceptible</v>
<v Speaker 8>to because I guess the parents don't.</v>

3552
02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:10.950
<v Speaker 8>They just live way easier and fresh </v>
<v Speaker 8>water,</v>

3553
02:49:11.070 --> 02:49:12.570
<v Speaker 8>which makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

3554
02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:14.593
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Also the salmon stop eating and their </v>

3555
02:49:17.311 --> 02:49:18.144
<v Speaker 8>metabolism changes once they get back to</v>
<v Speaker 8>fresh water and so essentially they're </v>

3556
02:49:21.781 --> 02:49:23.700
<v Speaker 8>dying from that point on,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3557
02:49:23.701 --> 02:49:26.610
<v Speaker 8>so when you see them upstream there,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're like zombies.</v>

3558
02:49:26.611 --> 02:49:27.444
<v Speaker 8>It's really gross.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Sushi is a really nutty thing when you </v>

3559
02:49:29.551 --> 02:49:30.820
<v Speaker 8>stop and think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

3560
02:49:30.900 --> 02:49:32.850
<v Speaker 8>Because here we are,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're,</v>

3561
02:49:32.910 --> 02:49:36.930
<v Speaker 8>we're like on these little landmasses </v>
<v Speaker 8>surrounded by a blue.</v>

3562
02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:37.793
<v Speaker 8>Like as soon as you get to the edge,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you realize how much blue there and </v>

3563
02:49:39.280 --> 02:49:40.980
<v Speaker 8>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Holy Shit,</v>

3564
02:49:41.220 --> 02:49:42.710
<v Speaker 8>that's all water.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

3565
02:49:42.720 --> 02:49:43.231
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

3566
02:49:43.231 --> 02:49:44.400
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We'll just so accustomed to it.</v>

3567
02:49:44.401 --> 02:49:45.420
<v Speaker 8>No big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's just water.</v>

3568
02:49:45.580 --> 02:49:45.981
<v Speaker 8>So.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

3569
02:49:45.981 --> 02:49:48.090
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's this thing is mostly water.</v>

3570
02:49:48.390 --> 02:49:50.910
<v Speaker 8>We're on the dirt spots of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's mostly water.</v>

3571
02:49:51.060 --> 02:49:51.893
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well we do is we take these metal boxes </v>

3572
02:49:53.220 --> 02:49:56.850
<v Speaker 8>and we float out there and we grab </v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever is live and we scoop it up with</v>

3573
02:49:56.851 --> 02:49:59.430
<v Speaker 8>nets and fucking bring it in Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's great.</v>

3574
02:49:59.640 --> 02:50:03.540
<v Speaker 8>We serve it with a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 8>Jalapeno on top and some ponds do sauce.</v>

3575
02:50:03.780 --> 02:50:04.613
<v Speaker 8>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Love it and we're just extracting the </v>

3576
02:50:07.591 --> 02:50:10.410
<v Speaker 8>fish out of the water ever.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just pulling them out.</v>

3577
02:50:10.411 --> 02:50:11.244
<v Speaker 8>It's the only thing like it in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 8>that fact that we're not dealing with </v>

3578
02:50:15.811 --> 02:50:19.260
<v Speaker 8>farmed animals were scooping up wild </v>
<v Speaker 8>animals.</v>

3579
02:50:19.260 --> 02:50:21.300
<v Speaker 8>We don't allow that anymore in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>United States,</v>

3580
02:50:21.450 --> 02:50:22.283
<v Speaker 8>like the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you don't use the age to have market </v>

3581
02:50:23.521 --> 02:50:26.220
<v Speaker 8>hunting for buffalo and for elk and for </v>
<v Speaker 8>deer.</v>

3582
02:50:26.221 --> 02:50:28.050
<v Speaker 8>You're not allowed to do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's illegal.</v>

3583
02:50:28.260 --> 02:50:30.210
<v Speaker 8>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Wild game is wild,</v>

3584
02:50:30.330 --> 02:50:32.490
<v Speaker 8>but not wild fish,</v>
<v Speaker 8>wild fish.</v>

3585
02:50:32.491 --> 02:50:33.324
<v Speaker 8>You can commercially farm,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you could commercially cultivated and </v>

3586
02:50:37.291 --> 02:50:38.124
<v Speaker 8>harvest you go out there with giant </v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking nets and just scoop up wild </v>

3587
02:50:41.971 --> 02:50:42.804
<v Speaker 8>creatures in the middle of the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 8>because we don't have good regulations </v>

3588
02:50:45.271 --> 02:50:46.104
<v Speaker 8>for the fucking ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So 80 percent of what you bring up that </v>

3589
02:50:49.171 --> 02:50:50.340
<v Speaker 8>you killed.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh yes.</v>

3590
02:50:50.341 --> 02:50:53.850
<v Speaker 8>Throw it over.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're just draining that thing.</v>

3591
02:50:53.940 --> 02:50:56.730
<v Speaker 8>We're draining and it's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's a wild thing.</v>

3592
02:50:57.030 --> 02:50:57.863
<v Speaker 8>If like we,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if anybody tried to propose that today </v>

3593
02:50:59.701 --> 02:51:02.220
<v Speaker 8>with like elk,</v>
<v Speaker 8>someone said,</v>

3594
02:51:02.221 --> 02:51:05.340
<v Speaker 8>we're just going to get nets and just </v>
<v Speaker 8>run through the forest and gather up all</v>

3595
02:51:05.341 --> 02:51:07.710
<v Speaker 8>the elk and then we're going to sell it </v>
<v Speaker 8>at the ELC store.</v>

3596
02:51:07.890 --> 02:51:10.710
<v Speaker 8>You'd be like the fuck you are right the</v>
<v Speaker 8>fuck you are,</v>

3597
02:51:10.711 --> 02:51:11.544
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those things are wild and kill all the </v>

3598
02:51:12.871 --> 02:51:17.690
<v Speaker 8>Iraqi tunes and squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So you're decimating the environment and</v>

3599
02:51:17.730 --> 02:51:18.563
<v Speaker 8>monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>

3600
02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:19.360
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

3601
02:51:19.360 --> 02:51:23.670
<v Speaker 8>the nets are super a work.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They work really hard,</v>

3602
02:51:23.671 --> 02:51:25.050
<v Speaker 8>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Pulling through all that water.</v>

3603
02:51:25.350 --> 02:51:27.330
<v Speaker 8>Two or three trips,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they cut them loose.</v>

3604
02:51:28.080 --> 02:51:30.150
<v Speaker 8>They don't pull them back up to the boat</v>
<v Speaker 8>and recycle them.</v>

3605
02:51:30.300 --> 02:51:33.690
<v Speaker 8>They cut them loose.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So oceans are full of drifting nets,</v>

3606
02:51:33.700 --> 02:51:34.533
<v Speaker 8>miles wide,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just going on and killing more and more </v>

3607
02:51:38.041 --> 02:51:41.640
<v Speaker 8>shit until they finally say no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3608
02:51:41.700 --> 02:51:42.533
<v Speaker 8>Because as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's this kind of wilderness now where </v>

3609
02:51:44.491 --> 02:51:49.491
<v Speaker 8>it's unregulated largely and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 8>way to look at it and see all that Shit,</v>

3610
02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:51.540
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Holy Shit.</v>

3611
02:51:51.560 --> 02:51:53.580
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's really freaked me out.</v>

3612
02:51:54.030 --> 02:51:54.863
<v Speaker 8>Just thinking of the sheer numbers of </v>
<v Speaker 8>nets drifting through the water and </v>

3613
02:51:57.481 --> 02:52:00.210
<v Speaker 8>landing on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know that because a friend of mine was</v>

3614
02:52:00.211 --> 02:52:03.600
<v Speaker 8>working with a guy who was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if I remember this correctly,</v>

3615
02:52:03.601 --> 02:52:05.620
<v Speaker 8>it's in Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think kyle who's a,</v>

3616
02:52:05.650 --> 02:52:06.483
<v Speaker 8>he's a surfer,</v>

3617
02:52:06.880 --> 02:52:09.370
<v Speaker 3>goes around the world and does </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting research.</v>

3618
02:52:10.090 --> 02:52:10.923
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was in Chile and there was a guy </v>

3619
02:52:13.721 --> 02:52:14.554
<v Speaker 3>starting a company that was created a </v>
<v Speaker 3>market for those nets to encourage the </v>

3620
02:52:18.731 --> 02:52:21.310
<v Speaker 3>fisherman to bring them back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he recycled that,</v>

3621
02:52:21.430 --> 02:52:22.263
<v Speaker 3>that nylon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a pretty high quality </v>

3622
02:52:23.981 --> 02:52:25.860
<v Speaker 3>nylon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the whole idea is he's,</v>

3623
02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:30.400
<v Speaker 3>he's created a sustainable business </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling these things made from the nylon</v>

3624
02:52:30.401 --> 02:52:33.190
<v Speaker 3>that people know comes from the nylon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3625
02:52:33.191 --> 02:52:35.680
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ghost fishing.</v>

3626
02:52:36.610 --> 02:52:38.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they just go around.</v>

3627
02:52:39.070 --> 02:52:41.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a talking about Sushi.</v>

3628
02:52:41.321 --> 02:52:46.321
<v Speaker 3>I had a really traumatic experience with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that in Alaska that have I told you,</v>

3629
02:52:46.511 --> 02:52:47.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

3630
02:52:47.981 --> 02:52:48.814
<v Speaker 3>I met this dude on the ferry going up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really Cool Guy Ed from Oregon </v>

3631
02:52:52.391 --> 02:52:54.820
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was camping next to me on the deck of</v>

3632
02:52:54.821 --> 02:52:55.654
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ferry boat and next to him was this </v>

3633
02:52:58.361 --> 02:52:59.194
<v Speaker 3>really hot woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Becca and Becca never changed her </v>

3634
02:53:01.721 --> 02:53:04.030
<v Speaker 3>clothes in like three or four days on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ferry.</v>

3635
02:53:04.030 --> 02:53:06.400
<v Speaker 3>Really sexy but never changed her </v>
<v Speaker 3>clothes.</v>

3636
02:53:06.401 --> 02:53:08.710
<v Speaker 3>Never opened her backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had this huge backpack.</v>

3637
02:53:09.060 --> 02:53:10.900
<v Speaker 3>Finally it turned out it was full of </v>
<v Speaker 3>weed.</v>

3638
02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:15.200
<v Speaker 3>She was smuggling from Hawaii to Alaska.</v>

3758
02:58:40.590 --> 02:58:41.423
<v Speaker 1>That's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my buddy had got medivaced out of </v>

3759
02:58:43.741 --> 02:58:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Petersburg with the worms in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>stomach,</v>

<v Speaker 1>intestinal bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

3761
02:58:49.291 --> 02:58:51.000
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to burrow the way out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3762
02:58:51.210 --> 02:58:52.043
<v Speaker 1>Eat his bones on the inside.</v>

02:58:56.760 --> 02:58:59.910
<v Speaker 1>He went to the doctor the next day in </v>
<v Speaker 1>town and the doctor was like,</v>

3765
02:58:59.911 --> 02:59:01.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably no big deal.</v>

3766
02:59:01.321 --> 02:59:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you doctor.</v>

3767
02:59:03.360 --> 02:59:04.193

<v Speaker 6>That's from the butterfly larva.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They pulled out of that things body.</v>

3868
03:04:05.150 --> 03:04:06.200
<v Speaker 6>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3869
03:04:06.201 --> 03:04:07.034
<v Speaker 6>and they said that there were so many of</v>
<v Speaker 6>them that they tested that have like </v>

3870
03:04:09.680 --> 03:04:10.513
<v Speaker 6>terminal illnesses in them to just </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking everywhere to man and in New </v>

3871
03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:16.033
<v Speaker 6>York they set this camera up while those</v>
<v Speaker 6>garbage bags were being put out and you </v>

3872
03:04:18.801 --> 03:04:19.634
<v Speaker 6>see the ratchet darn out of the sewer </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then they stuck cameras down to </v>

3873
03:04:22.670 --> 03:04:23.503
<v Speaker 6>sewer hose to find them and they learn </v>
<v Speaker 6>about poisonous and they'll piss on it </v>

3874
03:04:27.081 --> 03:04:28.880
<v Speaker 6>to warrant or they'll send in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't they?</v>

3875
03:04:28.910 --> 03:04:33.170
<v Speaker 6>Didn't he say they'll send in like like </v>
<v Speaker 6>Beta rats to the poison?</v>

3876
03:04:33.320 --> 03:04:35.480
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the sending Beta rats and they get stuck</v>

3877
03:04:35.481 --> 03:04:36.314
<v Speaker 6>in traps and they get they poison and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll sit back and they'll watch and </v>

3878
03:04:39.501 --> 03:04:41.450
<v Speaker 6>you can observe them do this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They literally,</v>

3879
03:04:41.720 --> 03:04:43.520
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they literally send the dumber or routes</v>

3880
03:04:43.521 --> 03:04:44.160
<v Speaker 6>for their.</v>

3881
03:04:44.160 --> 03:04:46.970
<v Speaker 6>They're like all things we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 6>about earlier,</v>

3882
03:04:47.240 --> 03:04:49.250
<v Speaker 6>they're like a super organism,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a rats.</v>

3883
03:04:49.610 --> 03:04:52.430
<v Speaker 6>Rats are all basically the same shape </v>
<v Speaker 6>and size.</v>

3884
03:04:52.520 --> 03:04:54.830
<v Speaker 6>They vary a little bit bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a little bit smaller,</v>

3885
03:04:54.831 --> 03:04:55.664
<v Speaker 6>but mostly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who Look exactly the same and they </v>

3886
03:04:57.501 --> 03:04:59.360
<v Speaker 6>behave like the same.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They do,</v>

3887
03:04:59.400 --> 03:05:01.850
<v Speaker 6>they all do the same shit and they all </v>
<v Speaker 6>move into these and they're.</v>

3888
03:05:01.851 --> 03:05:02.684
<v Speaker 6>They're happy to live with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nothing else wants to live like we'll </v>

3889
03:05:04.160 --> 03:05:04.993
<v Speaker 6>take it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll moving in and they move in and </v>

3890
03:05:06.710 --> 03:05:07.543
<v Speaker 6>breed in a way that's unprecedented in </v>
<v Speaker 6>terms of things that like mammals that </v>

3891
03:05:12.501 --> 03:05:15.920
<v Speaker 6>live alongside humans,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's not a goddamn thing like rats,</v>

3892
03:05:16.220 --> 03:05:18.410
<v Speaker 6>like no other animals figured out how to</v>
<v Speaker 6>do it.</v>

3893
03:05:18.411 --> 03:05:19.244
<v Speaker 6>Like Rats,</v>
<v Speaker 6>k like they can do it in a way where </v>

3894
03:05:20.901 --> 03:05:24.730
<v Speaker 6>this as many of them as there was a bus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just imagine that there's smart.</v>

3895
03:05:25.530 --> 03:05:29.530
<v Speaker 6>His father must be a lot of cockroaches.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Probably,</v>

3896
03:05:29.690 --> 03:05:32.290
<v Speaker 6>I would guess more than there are rats,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3897
03:05:32.410 --> 03:05:34.310
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because they're so small.</v>

3898
03:05:34.380 --> 03:05:35.213
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but those tools are like particular </v>

3899
03:05:36.861 --> 03:05:37.694
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really interesting because people </v>

3900
03:05:39.320 --> 03:05:40.153
<v Speaker 6>don't like to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They always want to think that they </v>

3901
03:05:41.811 --> 03:05:43.490
<v Speaker 6>never.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They never prejudge.</v>

3902
03:05:44.180 --> 03:05:46.640
<v Speaker 6>They're not prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we certainly are.</v>

3903
03:05:46.940 --> 03:05:50.420
<v Speaker 6>When it comes to rats and bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Butterflies are awesome.</v>

3904
03:05:50.510 --> 03:05:52.280
<v Speaker 6>Butterfly landed on you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's psyched.</v>

3905
03:05:52.320 --> 03:05:55.160
<v Speaker 6>Roche walks in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody freaks out.</v>

3906
03:05:55.670 --> 03:05:57.330
<v Speaker 6>Wants to fucking stop it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get it.</v>

3907
03:05:57.750 --> 03:05:59.840
<v Speaker 6>Get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3908
03:05:59.900 --> 03:06:01.730
<v Speaker 6>Mosquito comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's pissed.</v>

3909
03:06:02.180 --> 03:06:03.560
<v Speaker 6>Spider walks in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>AH,</v>

3910
03:06:03.561 --> 03:06:05.780
<v Speaker 6>some people freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people want to help the spider.</v>

3911
03:06:06.260 --> 03:06:06.861
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

3912
03:06:06.861 --> 03:06:10.640
<v Speaker 6>when you see any kind of rat rats are no</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bueno.</v>

3913
03:06:10.700 --> 03:06:13.260
<v Speaker 6>Like to the core.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You see that rat and you're like that.</v>

3914
03:06:13.261 --> 03:06:16.990
<v Speaker 6>And a squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Squirrels are cool.</v>

3915
03:06:17.700 --> 03:06:22.700
<v Speaker 6>Just rats with bushy tail per well.</v>

3916
03:06:24.110 --> 03:06:26.360
<v Speaker 6>They don't eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the thing about squirrels.</v>

3917
03:06:26.361 --> 03:06:30.110
<v Speaker 6>Squirrels were eating acorns and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is just a better animal,</v>

3918
03:06:30.111 --> 03:06:30.944
<v Speaker 6>but they do eat meat sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's the fucked up thing about </v>

3919
03:06:33.591 --> 03:06:35.290
<v Speaker 6>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially if there's,</v>

3920
03:06:35.350 --> 03:06:36.183
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're sick or they have some weird </v>

3921
03:06:36.831 --> 03:06:37.664
<v Speaker 6>nutrition requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a video of a squirrel eating a </v>

3922
03:06:39.801 --> 03:06:43.010
<v Speaker 6>mouse and it's hard to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>

3923
03:06:43.160 --> 03:06:43.993
<v Speaker 6>The squirrel was holding onto this mouth</v>
<v Speaker 6>mouse with its hands and just chewing </v>

3924
03:06:47.810 --> 03:06:48.990
<v Speaker 6>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A fucking score.</v>

3925
03:06:49.640 --> 03:06:50.540
<v Speaker 6>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

3926
03:06:50.600 --> 03:06:52.970
<v Speaker 6>really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a real trusted you.</v>

3927
03:06:53.690 --> 03:06:54.950
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're a fucking squirrel.</v>

3928
03:06:55.560 --> 03:06:56.010
<v Speaker 6>You're supposed to</v>

3929
03:06:56.010 --> 03:06:58.320
<v Speaker 8>be super cool.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I could feed you like you could.</v>

3930
03:06:58.400 --> 03:07:00.070
<v Speaker 8>Like there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Look at it,</v>

3931
03:07:03.400 --> 03:07:08.400
<v Speaker 8>but you always think,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well you started it with the warm in the</v>

3932
03:07:08.671 --> 03:07:10.870
<v Speaker 8>ass,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's been downhill from there.</v>

3933
03:07:10.871 --> 03:07:11.704
<v Speaker 8>I'm excited to look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's insane because he doesn't have any </v>

3934
03:07:17.251 --> 03:07:20.160
<v Speaker 8>problem eating that rap.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's watching a movie.</v>

3935
03:07:20.161 --> 03:07:25.161
<v Speaker 8>It's like he's watching game of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like enjoying some quickies devouring.</v>

3936
03:07:26.371 --> 03:07:31.371
<v Speaker 8>It seems like it's like you holding onto</v>
<v Speaker 8>a ham cream cone.</v>

3937
03:07:32.480 --> 03:07:33.930
<v Speaker 8>Look at that because it's biting into </v>
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>

3938
03:07:36.990 --> 03:07:39.710
<v Speaker 8>Delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Looking at it.</v>

3939
03:07:39.720 --> 03:07:41.340
<v Speaker 8>It's almost gone.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jesus.</v>

3940
03:07:41.370 --> 03:07:42.720
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I dropped a big chunk.</v>

3941
03:07:42.730 --> 03:07:43.381
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he dropped.</v>

3942
03:07:43.381 --> 03:07:45.360
<v Speaker 8>So looking at these giant chunks of </v>
<v Speaker 8>guts.</v>

3943
03:07:45.361 --> 03:07:47.760
<v Speaker 8>It's consuming.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was hungry.</v>

3944
03:07:48.070 --> 03:07:49.350
<v Speaker 8>This is amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

3945
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:50.503
<v Speaker 8>It's too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The only audience he's bearing what's </v>

3946
03:07:54.031 --> 03:07:57.480
<v Speaker 8>left of it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is a ground squirrel.</v>

3947
03:07:57.630 --> 03:08:01.110
<v Speaker 8>This is a different kind of squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That might be why ground squirrels are a</v>

3948
03:08:01.111 --> 03:08:02.340
<v Speaker 8>totally different kind of squirrel.</v>

3949
03:08:02.610 --> 03:08:04.710
<v Speaker 8>Ground.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Squirrels are actually a real problem on</v>

3950
03:08:04.711 --> 03:08:07.410
<v Speaker 8>ranches because they make millions.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3951
03:08:07.740 --> 03:08:12.740
<v Speaker 8>They estimate to honed ranch is 270,000</v>
<v Speaker 8>acres and someone there told me,</v>

3952
03:08:14.410 --> 03:08:15.243
<v Speaker 8>I didn't check this true,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but just listen if it is told me that </v>

3953
03:08:17.821 --> 03:08:18.654
<v Speaker 8>the biomass of these ground squirrels is</v>
<v Speaker 8>bigger than anything else on the ranch </v>

3954
03:08:25.170 --> 03:08:26.003
<v Speaker 8>because these tiny little things there </v>
<v Speaker 8>so fucking many of them that all the </v>

3955
03:08:28.501 --> 03:08:30.930
<v Speaker 8>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all the bear or the mountain lions,</v>

3956
03:08:30.931 --> 03:08:34.200
<v Speaker 8>all the wild pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all the cattle that roam around there,</v>

3957
03:08:34.201 --> 03:08:35.730
<v Speaker 8>all the elk,</v>
<v Speaker 8>everything,</v>

3958
03:08:35.820 --> 03:08:37.020
<v Speaker 8>every other bird,</v>
<v Speaker 8>ground,</v>

3959
03:08:37.021 --> 03:08:38.190
<v Speaker 8>nesting birds,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Turkeys,</v>

3960
03:08:38.220 --> 03:08:39.053
<v Speaker 8>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The biomass of those fucking ground </v>

3961
03:08:41.101 --> 03:08:44.100
<v Speaker 8>squirrels was greater than all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's like,</v>

3962
03:08:44.101 --> 03:08:45.510
<v Speaker 8>I just want you to think about that for </v>
<v Speaker 8>a second.</v>

3963
03:08:45.940 --> 03:08:46.820
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what?</v>

3964
03:08:47.220 --> 03:08:48.600
<v Speaker 8>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we got a real problem with these things.</v>

3965
03:08:48.601 --> 03:08:49.560
<v Speaker 8>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can't kill them,</v>

3966
03:08:49.830 --> 03:08:50.663
<v Speaker 8>and they leave holes and then the cattle</v>
<v Speaker 8>step in those holes and break their </v>

3967
03:08:53.521 --> 03:08:54.150
<v Speaker 8>ankles.</v>

3968
03:08:54.150 --> 03:08:58.050
<v Speaker 8>You can't kill him because they're just </v>
<v Speaker 8>too wildly where you gotta find them,</v>

3969
03:08:58.450 --> 03:09:02.390
<v Speaker 8>sit out there with a pistol and you're </v>
<v Speaker 8>going to shoot it like poison or is what</v>

3970
03:09:02.400 --> 03:09:03.233
<v Speaker 8>he said.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He said he shot one of them and when he </v>

3971
03:09:05.311 --> 03:09:06.144
<v Speaker 8>shot it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>another one grabbed it and dragged it </v>

3972
03:09:07.921 --> 03:09:12.921
<v Speaker 8>into the hole to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Dude.</v>

3973
03:09:13.570 --> 03:09:14.780
<v Speaker 8>Eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3974
03:09:16.280 --> 03:09:21.280
<v Speaker 8>Not find out if ground nesting squirrels</v>
<v Speaker 8>eat meat.</v>

3975
03:09:23.140 --> 03:09:25.230
<v Speaker 8>If ground nesting squirrels are </v>
<v Speaker 8>omnivores,</v>

3976
03:09:25.330 --> 03:09:26.163
<v Speaker 8>I wonder if they have a just a totally </v>
<v Speaker 8>different diet because the they have </v>

3977
03:09:28.691 --> 03:09:31.610
<v Speaker 8>those gross tails to.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They have almost rat tails.</v>

3978
03:09:31.660 --> 03:09:32.493
<v Speaker 8>The gross little things.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You don't feel good or when you're </v>

3979
03:09:34.051 --> 03:09:36.120
<v Speaker 8>around them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's why we need more snakes.</v>

3980
03:09:36.570 --> 03:09:38.430
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We don't need more snakes.</v>

3981
03:09:38.490 --> 03:09:40.620
<v Speaker 8>We don't need more snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Snakes.</v>

3982
03:09:40.680 --> 03:09:44.880
<v Speaker 8>Snakes are one of the only things that </v>
<v Speaker 8>all babies are afraid of.</v>

3983
03:09:44.940 --> 03:09:45.773
<v Speaker 8>Instinctively.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Show an infant the new image of a snake </v>

3984
03:09:50.161 --> 03:09:51.180
<v Speaker 8>and they'll just freak.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 8>Eden.</v>

3988
03:09:57.040 --> 03:09:58.270
<v Speaker 9>He's right though.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's true.</v>

3989
03:09:58.271 --> 03:10:00.640
<v Speaker 9>Snakes fault.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Eaves a good chick.</v>

3990
03:10:00.940 --> 03:10:03.640
<v Speaker 9>Most neotropic.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Ground squirrels are omnivorous.</v>

3991
03:10:03.700 --> 03:10:04.630
<v Speaker 9>Or you go.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There you go.</v>

3992
03:10:04.750 --> 03:10:06.280
<v Speaker 9>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So they're eating meat.</v>

3993
03:10:07.330 --> 03:10:12.330
<v Speaker 9>Ground oral sex.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Caterpillar's crooked mice and make each</v>

3994
03:10:13.151 --> 03:10:13.691
<v Speaker 9>other.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

3995
03:10:13.691 --> 03:10:16.000
<v Speaker 9>they get in there and eat the eggs </v>
<v Speaker 9>rather than asked.</v>

3996
03:10:16.030 --> 03:10:17.500
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Ground nesting birds.</v>

3997
03:10:18.190 --> 03:10:19.380
<v Speaker 9>Ducks.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3998
03:10:19.420 --> 03:10:22.330
<v Speaker 9>Eggs and chicks and ducks and birds.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Mice.</v>

3999
03:10:22.570 --> 03:10:24.190
<v Speaker 9>Smaller ground squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh yeah.</v>

4000
03:10:24.191 --> 03:10:25.024
<v Speaker 9>So squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Ground squirrels are just little </v>

4001
03:10:26.380 --> 03:10:27.540
<v Speaker 9>monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4002
03:10:27.850 --> 03:10:28.683
<v Speaker 9>That's why we feel bad about them.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They're the little evil little </v>

4003
03:10:31.691 --> 03:10:33.580
<v Speaker 9>mediators.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So what?</v>

4004
03:10:34.290 --> 03:10:36.010
<v Speaker 9>Coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I guess probably get something.</v>

4005
03:10:36.190 --> 03:10:37.023
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but the problem is they dig into holes </v>

4006
03:10:37.961 --> 03:10:39.520
<v Speaker 9>and the coyotes have a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 9>catching them.</v>

4007
03:10:39.640 --> 03:10:43.990
<v Speaker 9>Too dark to that fucking hole so quick.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't think it's an effective method.</v>

4008
03:10:43.991 --> 03:10:44.824
<v Speaker 9>I don't think they have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 9>effective methods of eradicating them </v>

4009
03:10:46.511 --> 03:10:47.830
<v Speaker 9>other than like poison and shit.</v>

4010
03:10:47.830 --> 03:10:49.180
<v Speaker 9>If I had a guest.</v>
<v Speaker 9>What about those?</v>

4011
03:10:49.181 --> 03:10:51.850
<v Speaker 9>Rat Terriers in the spurlock shot?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Remember that?</v>

<v Speaker 9>it was amazing.</v>

4013
03:10:52.990 --> 03:10:56.740
<v Speaker 9>They actually hunt rats.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I haven't seen the film though.</v>

4014
03:10:57.280 --> 03:11:00.850
<v Speaker 9>They tear these rats apart.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They live for it.</v>

4015
03:11:01.050 --> 03:11:01.883
<v Speaker 9>So they live for.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They are in their glory when they let </v>

4016
03:11:04.031 --> 03:11:06.640
<v Speaker 9>them loose with these terriers.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Go correct.</v>

03:11:35.371 --> 03:11:36.310
<v Speaker 9>they're digging them up.</v>

4027
03:11:36.340 --> 03:11:37.690
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4031
03:11:52.070 --> 03:11:54.640
<v Speaker 9>hole.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And as they dig them out of the holes,</v>

<v Speaker 9>It's crazy.</v>

4036
03:12:03.520 --> 03:12:05.740
<v Speaker 9>You can almost engineer any animal.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 9>there's one.</v>

4040
03:12:12.580 --> 03:12:15.660
<v Speaker 9>They're not eating them apart.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They were tearing them apart.</v>

4041
03:12:16.150 --> 03:12:18.640
<v Speaker 9>They're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Just like killing him.</v>

4042
03:12:18.730 --> 03:12:20.140
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they probably eat so much.</v>

4043
03:12:20.141 --> 03:12:22.260
<v Speaker 9>They're stuffed now that just,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

4044
03:12:22.570 --> 03:12:25.720

<v Speaker 9>that's a whole thing of that last one.</v>

4045
03:12:25.721 --> 03:12:26.554
<v Speaker 9>It looked like he was bringing it over,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like maybe they're trained to put them </v>

4046
03:12:28.841 --> 03:12:30.790
<v Speaker 9>in a bag or something.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That would be clutch.</v>

4047
03:12:30.820 --> 03:12:35.040
<v Speaker 9>Maybe you got to do something with the </v>
<v Speaker 9>body's a golden retrievers and stuff.</v>

4048
03:12:35.050 --> 03:12:36.220
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Then the ducks.</v>

4049
03:12:36.221 --> 03:12:37.054
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

4050
03:12:37.360 --> 03:12:41.110
<v Speaker 9>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 9>why are you so fascinated with this part</v>

4051
03:12:41.111 --> 03:12:41.944
<v Speaker 9>in nature?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like sometimes I got to be careful with </v>

4052
03:12:44.081 --> 03:12:45.250
<v Speaker 9>your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 9>man,</v>

4055
03:12:48.310 --> 03:12:49.320
<v Speaker 9>I don't look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But yeah,</v>

4056
03:12:49.330 --> 03:12:51.830
<v Speaker 9>inevitably if you tweet nature's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what do you say?</v>

4057
03:12:51.831 --> 03:12:52.510
<v Speaker 9>Nature's</v>

4058
03:12:52.510 --> 03:12:53.380
<v Speaker 8>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

4059
03:12:53.420 --> 03:12:54.440
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He says nature is.</v>

4060
03:12:54.620 --> 03:12:55.453
<v Speaker 8>What do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 8>What's the thing you say native friends </v>

4061
03:12:57.010 --> 03:12:58.150
<v Speaker 8>are scary.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Birch,</v>

4062
03:12:58.260 --> 03:13:00.390
<v Speaker 8>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If I see that I'm not watching this,</v>

4063
03:13:00.890 --> 03:13:02.110
<v Speaker 8>she's going to be awful.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's get.</v>

4064
03:13:02.180 --> 03:13:04.100
<v Speaker 8>But why do you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why do you?</v>

4065
03:13:04.190 --> 03:13:07.670
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>why are you so interested in that aspect</v>

4066
03:13:07.671 --> 03:13:08.860
<v Speaker 8>of nature?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

4067
03:13:08.900 --> 03:13:10.790
<v Speaker 8>super extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

4068
03:13:10.791 --> 03:13:12.770
<v Speaker 8>I mean this is an extreme event </v>
<v Speaker 8>happening here.</v>

4069
03:13:12.800 --> 03:13:13.633
<v Speaker 8>One life form is exploding on another </v>
<v Speaker 8>life form and it seems like it's </v>

4070
03:13:17.920 --> 03:13:20.900
<v Speaker 8>designed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When you see a Jaguar,</v>

4071
03:13:20.901 --> 03:13:21.734
<v Speaker 8>Kyla Cayman and grab it in the back of </v>
<v Speaker 8>its neck and bite into a fucking </v>

4072
03:13:25.041 --> 03:13:27.710
<v Speaker 8>crocodile and drag it in between its </v>
<v Speaker 8>legs,</v>

4073
03:13:27.711 --> 03:13:28.544
<v Speaker 8>up the beach to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're seeing one of the most extreme </v>

4074
03:13:31.521 --> 03:13:32.354
<v Speaker 8>things that exists in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're seeing a life form consuming </v>

4075
03:13:35.841 --> 03:13:38.650
<v Speaker 8>another life form with its face,</v>
<v Speaker 8>killing her,</v>

4076
03:13:38.810 --> 03:13:39.643
<v Speaker 8>like eliminating it from us dimension </v>
<v Speaker 8>with its teeth at a very specific part </v>

4077
03:13:43.161 --> 03:13:43.994
<v Speaker 8>of its body and it seems like it's </v>
<v Speaker 8>designed to do that and that's the only </v>

4078
03:13:46.701 --> 03:13:47.534
<v Speaker 8>way you keep these populations and </v>
<v Speaker 8>control the populations have a built in </v>

4079
03:13:50.361 --> 03:13:54.710
<v Speaker 8>system and we want to look at it through</v>
<v Speaker 8>the gobs of our civilization and through</v>

4080
03:13:54.711 --> 03:13:55.940
<v Speaker 8>what we've accepted.</v>

4081
03:13:55.940 --> 03:13:59.090
<v Speaker 8>This is a pet and this is an animal that</v>
<v Speaker 8>you eat and you never eat.</v>

4082
03:13:59.091 --> 03:14:03.170
<v Speaker 8>Your pat and we have all these weird </v>
<v Speaker 8>little sort of distinctions and cultural</v>

4083
03:14:03.171 --> 03:14:05.570
<v Speaker 8>ideas that we've attached to animal </v>
<v Speaker 8>life,</v>

4084
03:14:05.600 --> 03:14:09.200
<v Speaker 8>but he watched them in their world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Their world is fucking.</v>

4085
03:14:09.560 --> 03:14:14.000
<v Speaker 8>It's unbelievably ruthless,</v>
<v Speaker 8>unbelievably ruthless.</v>

4086
03:14:14.150 --> 03:14:18.680
<v Speaker 8>Like our ideas of animals have become so</v>
<v Speaker 8>strange because we keep,</v>

4087
03:14:18.681 --> 03:14:19.514
<v Speaker 8>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we keep them around us and we feed them </v>

4088
03:14:21.980 --> 03:14:22.813
<v Speaker 8>so they're like really sweet to us,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but there's not a fucking animal in all </v>

4089
03:14:26.061 --> 03:14:30.890
<v Speaker 8>of nature that is so sweet with the </v>
<v Speaker 8>other animals around it.</v>

4090
03:14:31.710 --> 03:14:34.410
<v Speaker 3>Just many animals that are sweet with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other animals around them.</v>

4091
03:14:34.411 --> 03:14:35.980
<v Speaker 3>All hurt animals for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4092
03:14:35.990 --> 03:14:36.860
<v Speaker 3>that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Social,</v>

4093
03:14:36.910 --> 03:14:39.660
<v Speaker 3>what I mean like Jaguars and antelopes </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't buddies.</v>

4094
03:14:40.200 --> 03:14:41.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the Jaguar is eaton,</v>

4095
03:14:41.820 --> 03:14:42.653
<v Speaker 3>he can walk right through the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hurt and they won't even run away </v>

4096
03:14:44.671 --> 03:14:46.530
<v Speaker 3>because they know he's not hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4097
03:14:46.531 --> 03:14:49.800
<v Speaker 3>but that's so crazy to think that's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a murderer and kills one of your buddies</v>

4098
03:14:49.801 --> 03:14:50.634
<v Speaker 3>and eat something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll be cool just wandering around </v>

4099
03:14:51.631 --> 03:14:53.170
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not visitors.</v>

4100
03:14:53.410 --> 03:14:54.660
<v Speaker 3>They're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're eating.</v>

4101
03:14:55.650 --> 03:15:00.030
<v Speaker 3>Their interactions are incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>ruthless when they wrap it,</v>

4102
03:15:00.360 --> 03:15:01.193
<v Speaker 3>but see I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is something I write about in this </v>

4103
03:15:02.730 --> 03:15:03.563
<v Speaker 3>book I'm working on still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the lack of proportionality in </v>

4104
03:15:09.691 --> 03:15:13.380
<v Speaker 3>this argument because what's your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This nature is ruthless red in tooth and</v>

4105
03:15:13.381 --> 03:15:14.214
<v Speaker 3>claw thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's been very popular for a long </v>

4106
03:15:15.961 --> 03:15:16.794
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the real well it's real when it's </v>

4107
03:15:18.781 --> 03:15:19.614
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also real that we die in agony </v>

4108
03:15:22.130 --> 03:15:22.963
<v Speaker 3>and often our agony is extended by </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine to last much longer than that </v>

4109
03:15:26.911 --> 03:15:27.744
<v Speaker 3>mouse that just got eaten by the score.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by death by these </v>

4110
03:15:31.681 --> 03:15:34.260
<v Speaker 3>interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is that the,</v>

4111
03:15:35.160 --> 03:15:35.993
<v Speaker 3>the conclusion to draw from those </v>
<v Speaker 3>interactions that therefore nature is </v>

4112
03:15:40.291 --> 03:15:41.124
<v Speaker 3>this battlefield misrepresents what </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually happens in nature when </v>

4113
03:15:46.950 --> 03:15:49.050
<v Speaker 3>predation happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be nasty of.</v>

4114
03:15:49.500 --> 03:15:50.010
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's</v>

4115
03:15:50.010 --> 03:15:50.843
<v Speaker 8>what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not looking at the entire nature as </v>

4116
03:15:52.351 --> 03:15:55.170
<v Speaker 8>a whole and making this distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is the only thing interesting about</v>

4117
03:15:55.171 --> 03:15:55.801
<v Speaker 8>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

4118
03:15:55.801 --> 03:15:56.220
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

4119
03:15:56.220 --> 03:15:59.970
<v Speaker 8>I'm saying when I just the depiction of </v>
<v Speaker 8>nature as being ruthless.</v>

4120
03:16:00.060 --> 03:16:00.893
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it is in that moment that is nature and </v>

4121
03:16:02.111 --> 03:16:04.440
<v Speaker 8>that isn't that moment and in that </v>
<v Speaker 8>moment exists.</v>

4122
03:16:04.441 --> 03:16:07.500
<v Speaker 8>The only reason why these predators can </v>
<v Speaker 8>exist is because they have to be killing</v>

4123
03:16:07.501 --> 03:16:08.940
<v Speaker 8>things all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

4124
03:16:08.941 --> 03:16:09.774
<v Speaker 8>every place where there's a wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it means the wolf is alive because it's </v>

4125
03:16:12.091 --> 03:16:12.924
<v Speaker 8>eating things,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which means it's killing things all day </v>

4126
03:16:14.071 --> 03:16:14.904
<v Speaker 8>long.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

4127
03:16:14.910 --> 03:16:17.610
<v Speaker 8>that's not a.</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's not an inaccurate depiction.</v>

4128
03:16:17.611 --> 03:16:20.570
<v Speaker 8>The thing is there's so many things.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's so many elk exist,</v>

4129
03:16:20.650 --> 03:16:21.483
<v Speaker 8>so many wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Most of the time the elk aren't getting </v>

4130
03:16:22.951 --> 03:16:23.784
<v Speaker 8>killed by wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but wolves are killing an elk almost </v>

4131
03:16:26.281 --> 03:16:27.114
<v Speaker 8>every store,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so it's just a matter how you look at </v>

4132
03:16:28.381 --> 03:16:29.330
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it's just,</v>

4133
03:16:29.331 --> 03:16:30.164
<v Speaker 8>it's correct to say diminishing the </v>
<v Speaker 8>ruthless aspect of it because you're </v>

4134
03:16:33.751 --> 03:16:34.850
<v Speaker 8>looking at the overall picture,</v>

4135
03:16:34.900 --> 03:16:36.380
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not diminishing it.</v>

4136
03:16:36.390 --> 03:16:37.223
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is that that's one </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective on it and actually in terms </v>

4137
03:16:40.291 --> 03:16:43.800
<v Speaker 3>of proportion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a minor perspective on it.</v>

4138
03:16:44.070 --> 03:16:44.903
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching this nature thing and </v>

4139
03:16:46.351 --> 03:16:47.184
<v Speaker 3>there were these seals playing in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>waves and then the du Du du Du du Du du </v>

4140
03:16:50.461 --> 03:16:51.294
<v Speaker 3>Du to start in this great white comes up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hits one of the seals and they slow </v>

4141
03:16:55.561 --> 03:16:58.540
<v Speaker 3>it down to one 40th natural speeds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>ORC.</v>

4142
03:16:58.710 --> 03:17:00.810
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I think it was a great way.</v>

4143
03:17:01.050 --> 03:17:03.120
<v Speaker 3>It may have been an Orca at same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing,</v>

4144
03:17:03.850 --> 03:17:04.683
<v Speaker 3>and this seal lands in its mouth and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see a crunching the seal and the blood </v>

4145
03:17:08.041 --> 03:17:12.540
<v Speaker 3>running down and the narration is nature</v>
<v Speaker 3>is ruthless and there's the never ending</v>

4146
03:17:12.541 --> 03:17:14.340
<v Speaker 3>struggle for survival and Yada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yada,</v>

4147
03:17:14.341 --> 03:17:16.670
<v Speaker 3>Yada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I'm looking at that.</v>

4148
03:17:16.690 --> 03:17:19.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long do harbor seals live?</v>

4149
03:17:19.980 --> 03:17:21.030
<v Speaker 3>So I look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Online.</v>

4150
03:17:21.031 --> 03:17:25.710
<v Speaker 3>Harbor Seals live about 25 to 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a lot of seals lying around on</v>

4151
03:17:25.711 --> 03:17:28.110
<v Speaker 3>rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a good time not stressed out.</v>

4152
03:17:28.740 --> 03:17:32.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't see a lot of high stress seals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I think it's like,</v>

4153
03:17:32.670 --> 03:17:33.381
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this seal,</v>

4154
03:17:33.381 --> 03:17:36.990
<v Speaker 3>let's say live 25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hanging out eating Sushi,</v>

4155
03:17:36.991 --> 03:17:38.310
<v Speaker 3>having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then boom,</v>

4156
03:17:38.311 --> 03:17:39.144
<v Speaker 3>it's dead so quickly that we have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>slow this down to one 40th of normal </v>

4157
03:17:42.901 --> 03:17:43.734
<v Speaker 3>speed so you can enjoy this death porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a tiny sliver of that seals </v>

4158
03:17:49.510 --> 03:17:54.510
<v Speaker 3>existence and we're depicting nature as </v>
<v Speaker 3>this incredibly ruthless,</v>

4159
03:17:55.111 --> 03:17:55.640
<v Speaker 3>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll</v>

4160
03:17:55.640 --> 03:17:59.240
<v Speaker 8>bloody place.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's just inaccurate.</v>

4161
03:17:59.600 --> 03:18:00.950
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's not in that moment.</v>

4162
03:18:01.280 --> 03:18:03.920
<v Speaker 8>Not In that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you can't ignore that in moment.</v>

4163
03:18:03.950 --> 03:18:04.731
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>of course not.</v>

4164
03:18:04.731 --> 03:18:05.564
<v Speaker 8>That moment is the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but that moment is the reason why this </v>

4165
03:18:07.251 --> 03:18:11.420
<v Speaker 8>seals population is controlled moment is</v>
<v Speaker 8>the reason why the shark can.</v>

4166
03:18:11.570 --> 03:18:13.340
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It all has to be there.</v>

4167
03:18:13.341 --> 03:18:14.780
<v Speaker 8>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I disagree with you.</v>

4168
03:18:14.930 --> 03:18:15.763
<v Speaker 8>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I see you're saying that there's way </v>

4169
03:18:16.911 --> 03:18:19.520
<v Speaker 8>more going on than just as tooth Fang </v>
<v Speaker 8>claw.</v>

4170
03:18:19.820 --> 03:18:20.653
<v Speaker 8>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not looking at it from a moral </v>

4171
03:18:21.681 --> 03:18:22.514
<v Speaker 8>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm looking at it from a like a chaotic </v>

4172
03:18:23.901 --> 03:18:24.621
<v Speaker 8>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>

4173
03:18:24.621 --> 03:18:25.454
<v Speaker 8>it is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 8>These to these schools of tuna that we </v>

4174
03:18:28.610 --> 03:18:30.680
<v Speaker 8>scoop up with nets.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're out there,</v>

4175
03:18:30.681 --> 03:18:31.514
<v Speaker 8>Jack and little fish.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's why they're in schools because </v>

4176
03:18:33.240 --> 03:18:34.073
<v Speaker 8>they operate more efficiently that way </v>
<v Speaker 8>and they're chasing down sardines and </v>

4177
03:18:36.501 --> 03:18:39.410
<v Speaker 8>fucking them up and that's oftentimes </v>
<v Speaker 8>how you catch fish.</v>

4178
03:18:39.500 --> 03:18:42.770
<v Speaker 8>When I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when I was a tuna fishing in Mexico,</v>

4179
03:18:43.030 --> 03:18:46.550
<v Speaker 8>we're catching amberjack or skipjack,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I forget,</v>

4180
03:18:46.700 --> 03:18:47.533
<v Speaker 8>but you would find these pools of bait </v>
<v Speaker 8>fish bullet going crazy on the surface </v>

4181
03:18:51.641 --> 03:18:52.474
<v Speaker 8>of the water because the tune and were </v>
<v Speaker 8>all ganging up on and Jack it up and </v>

4182
03:18:55.631 --> 03:18:56.464
<v Speaker 8>then he got the Pelicans and top attack.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Cc the birds and then you would see the </v>

4183
03:19:00.221 --> 03:19:02.050
<v Speaker 8>froth of the water and then these fish </v>
<v Speaker 8>would just.</v>

4184
03:19:02.440 --> 03:19:03.273
<v Speaker 8>They'd go crazy and fuck up these little</v>
<v Speaker 8>bait fish and you would literally just </v>

4185
03:19:05.501 --> 03:19:06.334
<v Speaker 8>cast into this football field size </v>
<v Speaker 8>swirling in the ocean and these fish </v>

4186
03:19:10.841 --> 03:19:11.674
<v Speaker 8>would just bite it and you would just </v>
<v Speaker 8>catch them up almost instantly so that </v>

4187
03:19:14.560 --> 03:19:17.320
<v Speaker 8>that is not the whole ocean all the </v>
<v Speaker 8>time,</v>

4188
03:19:17.500 --> 03:19:19.970
<v Speaker 8>but that's still real.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like this is real.</v>

4189
03:19:19.990 --> 03:19:22.060
<v Speaker 8>I'm not denying the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm talking to proportion.</v>

4190
03:19:22.600 --> 03:19:23.433
<v Speaker 8>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but the thing that I find the most </v>

4191
03:19:24.701 --> 03:19:28.600
<v Speaker 8>fascinating for whatever fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 8>reason is when the water,</v>

4192
03:19:28.840 --> 03:19:29.673
<v Speaker 8>the water buffalo comes out the line and</v>
<v Speaker 8>the line ducks under the water buffalo </v>

4193
03:19:32.911 --> 03:19:36.340
<v Speaker 8>and grabs it by its neck and rolled it </v>
<v Speaker 8>over and crushes it.</v>

4194
03:19:36.341 --> 03:19:37.330
<v Speaker 8>Saying,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just,</v>

4195
03:19:37.420 --> 03:19:42.420
<v Speaker 8>I am fascinated by the idea that all </v>
<v Speaker 8>moral judgments aside nature has somehow</v>

4196
03:19:45.220 --> 03:19:50.220
<v Speaker 8>engineered a Jaguar and a cayman,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and then there's Jaguar looked at Cayman</v>

4197
03:19:50.920 --> 03:19:51.753
<v Speaker 8>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>ah,</v>

4198
03:19:51.800 --> 03:19:55.780
<v Speaker 8>to figure out how to put that in me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And he snuck up,</v>

4199
03:19:55.840 --> 03:19:59.090
<v Speaker 8>swam in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 8>snuck up on a goddamn crocodile,</v>

4200
03:19:59.470 --> 03:20:01.560
<v Speaker 8>shopped on its back.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's an equity.</v>

4201
03:20:01.690 --> 03:20:03.730
<v Speaker 8>There's a lot of cool shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I like watching.</v>

4202
03:20:03.731 --> 03:20:04.564
<v Speaker 8>Jaguars is real.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I liked watching Jaguars when they get </v>

4203
03:20:06.101 --> 03:20:08.870
<v Speaker 8>ahold of psychedelic plants.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Have you ever seen that?</v>

4204
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:11.783
<v Speaker 8>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's this type of vine that's rich </v>

4205
03:20:13.931 --> 03:20:14.764
<v Speaker 8>and dmt that Jaguars will chew on and </v>
<v Speaker 8>then they literally just lie on their </v>

4206
03:20:18.371 --> 03:20:19.204
<v Speaker 8>back and they're just staring out into </v>
<v Speaker 8>space trip and balls like catnip for </v>

4207
03:20:22.010 --> 03:20:24.820
<v Speaker 8>Jaguar.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But if they think it's Psychedelic,</v>

4208
03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:28.480
<v Speaker 8>they think that might be when you have </v>
<v Speaker 8>all these Jaguar dreams,</v>

4209
03:20:28.481 --> 03:20:29.314
<v Speaker 8>when people take Iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it might be that the Jaguar is </v>

4210
03:20:31.721 --> 03:20:33.840
<v Speaker 8>interfacing with the same dimension that</v>
<v Speaker 8>you will.</v>

4211
03:20:33.841 --> 03:20:35.730
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so that's the reason why.</v>

4212
03:20:35.980 --> 03:20:36.813
<v Speaker 8>Because we know that these jaguars do </v>
<v Speaker 8>take these psychedelic plants and we </v>

4213
03:20:40.031 --> 03:20:42.550
<v Speaker 8>know that these psychedelic plants,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when they were first discovered,</v>

4214
03:20:42.820 --> 03:20:46.420
<v Speaker 8>they were trying to call.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm harming,</v>

4215
03:20:46.450 --> 03:20:47.130
<v Speaker 8>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

4216
03:20:47.130 --> 03:20:48.370
<v Speaker 8>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the chemical,</v>

4217
03:20:48.550 --> 03:20:53.020
<v Speaker 8>but they were trying to call it </v>
<v Speaker 8>telepathy theme was the same as harming.</v>

4218
03:20:53.200 --> 03:20:56.470
<v Speaker 8>They had to run tests on it and find out</v>
<v Speaker 8>that there was,</v>

4219
03:20:56.471 --> 03:20:57.304
<v Speaker 8>it was already an established molecule </v>
<v Speaker 8>that was an already established a </v>

4220
03:21:00.520 --> 03:21:01.353
<v Speaker 8>compound.</v>

4221
03:21:01.750 --> 03:21:02.583
<v Speaker 8>So the reason why they call it telepathy</v>
<v Speaker 8>was because people were experiencing </v>

4222
03:21:05.951 --> 03:21:08.650
<v Speaker 8>group states of consciousness while they</v>
<v Speaker 8>were taking this stuff,</v>

4223
03:21:09.040 --> 03:21:09.873
<v Speaker 8>so they're thinking that these people </v>
<v Speaker 8>that do Iowasca and have these trips </v>

4224
03:21:13.901 --> 03:21:18.070
<v Speaker 8>with Jaguars,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they literally might be interacting with</v>

4225
03:21:18.071 --> 03:21:18.904
<v Speaker 8>Jaguars who were also tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like I see this thing is just eating </v>

4226
03:21:21.881 --> 03:21:25.810
<v Speaker 8>these leaves and lion dyads back clearly</v>
<v Speaker 8>in an altered state,</v>

4227
03:21:26.740 --> 03:21:29.590
<v Speaker 8>just rolling around on its back with its</v>
<v Speaker 8>paws up in the air,</v>

4228
03:21:29.591 --> 03:21:32.800
<v Speaker 8>staring at things that aren't there </v>
<v Speaker 8>staring at.</v>

4229
03:21:32.801 --> 03:21:33.634
<v Speaker 8>It's like in Brooklyn right now with a </v>
<v Speaker 8>bunch of fucking people on some loft in </v>

4230
03:21:39.671 --> 03:21:43.160
<v Speaker 8>Brooklyn with some fucking glass </v>
<v Speaker 8>blowers.</v>

4231
03:21:43.170 --> 03:21:46.250
<v Speaker 8>A couple of accountants.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Its eyes dilate.</v>

4232
03:21:46.251 --> 03:21:51.080
<v Speaker 8>It's mine's going back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That is so fucking wild.</v>

4233
03:21:51.081 --> 03:21:51.914
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to Peru in a couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're going to get down with the funky </v>

4234
03:21:55.040 --> 03:21:56.560
<v Speaker 8>funky medicine plant medicine.</v>

4235
03:21:56.590 --> 03:21:57.311
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4236
03:21:57.311 --> 03:22:00.080
<v Speaker 8>If the right situation presents itself,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's the thing,</v>

4237
03:22:00.081 --> 03:22:00.914
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>The problem and the people that say </v>

4238
03:22:01.641 --> 03:22:03.420
<v Speaker 8>plant medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they all make go,</v>

4239
03:22:05.030 --> 03:22:05.863
<v Speaker 8>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're like really into like other the </v>

4240
03:22:07.040 --> 03:22:08.000
<v Speaker 8>plant medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're like,</v>

4241
03:22:08.500 --> 03:22:09.710
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

4242
03:22:09.711 --> 03:22:10.544
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You might be cool if you used those </v>

4243
03:22:11.961 --> 03:22:15.230
<v Speaker 8>terms all the time or you might be one </v>
<v Speaker 8>of those fucking Weirdos.</v>

4244
03:22:15.530 --> 03:22:15.960
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's,</v>

4245
03:22:15.960 --> 03:22:16.793
<v Speaker 8>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a bunch of people that are into </v>

4246
03:22:17.841 --> 03:22:22.220
<v Speaker 8>the psychedelic world that they know </v>
<v Speaker 8>they would have been into the moonies if</v>

4247
03:22:22.221 --> 03:22:23.780
<v Speaker 8>the moonies found them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

4248
03:22:23.840 --> 03:22:26.240
<v Speaker 8>There are lots of different plants that </v>
<v Speaker 8>they use though.</v>

4249
03:22:26.241 --> 03:22:27.074
<v Speaker 8>It's not just Iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so if you just use it as a general term </v>

4250
03:22:29.841 --> 03:22:31.240
<v Speaker 8>there,</v>
<v Speaker 8>San Pedro and all the time.</v>

4251
03:22:31.310 --> 03:22:33.730
<v Speaker 8>I'm fully aware.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's just the people love saying it.</v>

4252
03:22:33.740 --> 03:22:34.720
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They love saying.</v>

4253
03:22:36.420 --> 03:22:39.470
<v Speaker 8>I mean legally it's probably better to </v>
<v Speaker 8>use the term plant medicine.</v>

4254
03:22:39.680 --> 03:22:43.850
<v Speaker 8>It is so pretentious that aren't going </v>
<v Speaker 8>to get you stopped at any borders.</v>

4255
03:22:44.030 --> 03:22:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pretentious.</v>

4256
03:22:45.621 --> 03:22:46.454
<v Speaker 2>Like I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand why you're calling it a </v>

4257
03:22:48.621 --> 03:22:51.560
<v Speaker 2>plant medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like when I'm getting stoned,</v>

4258
03:22:52.280 --> 03:22:54.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me take my medicine.</v>

4259
03:22:54.830 --> 03:22:55.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me get.</v>

4260
03:22:55.820 --> 03:22:56.653
<v Speaker 2>I want to get fucking high man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanna I wanna like get high play with </v>

4261
03:22:59.180 --> 03:23:00.760
<v Speaker 2>synthesizers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I'm like,</v>

4262
03:23:00.860 --> 03:23:05.630
<v Speaker 2>when I'm taking Roba Tesson I'm thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking medicine right now.</v>

4263
03:23:05.631 --> 03:23:06.690
<v Speaker 2>It tastes like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna.</v>

4264
03:23:06.710 --> 03:23:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Make me fall asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just honestly,</v>

4265
03:23:08.661 --> 03:23:12.480
<v Speaker 2>the reason I don't like the term plant </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine is because I think it,</v>

4266
03:23:13.000 --> 03:23:13.833
<v Speaker 2>and forgive me out there you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like in some small way </v>

4267
03:23:17.211 --> 03:23:21.410
<v Speaker 2>diminishes all the other reasons I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take this fucking plant.</v>

4268
03:23:21.650 --> 03:23:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Like when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm like,</v>

4269
03:23:23.361 --> 03:23:24.194
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is such a degraded thing to </v>

4270
03:23:25.911 --> 03:23:27.500
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm sorry,</v>

4271
03:23:27.501 --> 03:23:29.660
<v Speaker 2>but remember when used to be sponsored </v>
<v Speaker 2>by fleshlight.</v>

4272
03:23:29.720 --> 03:23:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you fucked a flashlight,</v>

4273
03:23:31.791 --> 03:23:33.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it made you come shut.</v>

4274
03:23:33.950 --> 03:23:34.783
<v Speaker 2>You weren't thinking as you're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>the flashlight for the pure joy of like </v>

4275
03:23:39.470 --> 03:23:42.770
<v Speaker 2>experiencing an orgasm with this weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb thing.</v>

4276
03:23:42.771 --> 03:23:44.750
<v Speaker 2>This tube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not thinking to yourself,</v>

4277
03:23:45.050 --> 03:23:47.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving myself medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're thinking,</v>

4278
03:23:47.881 --> 03:23:50.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to assume this is you for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4279
03:23:50.001 --> 03:23:50.834
<v Speaker 2>for I want to come in the same way like </v>
<v Speaker 2>with some of these substances that he'd </v>

4280
03:23:54.820 --> 03:23:56.690
<v Speaker 2>never get high with you again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4281
03:24:00.370 --> 03:24:01.203
<v Speaker 2>The fucking house plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just sometimes it's a plant </v>

4282
03:24:05.001 --> 03:24:08.390
<v Speaker 2>medicine sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you get high?</v>

4283
03:24:08.391 --> 03:24:09.224
<v Speaker 2>Are you saying that sometimes you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>high just because it feels good to </v>

4284
03:24:11.200 --> 03:24:13.670
<v Speaker 2>behind?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what I'm saying.</v>

4285
03:24:13.671 --> 03:24:15.380
<v Speaker 2>That's why God made nitric oxide.</v>

4286
03:24:16.060 --> 03:24:16.893
<v Speaker 8>Can didn't you get your license with me </v>
<v Speaker 8>from a black guy with dreadlocks was a </v>

4287
03:24:21.401 --> 03:24:23.720
<v Speaker 8>doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 8>was calling it the medicine wasn't a,</v>

4288
03:24:23.770 --> 03:24:25.120
<v Speaker 8>didn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I go to that place.</v>

4289
03:24:25.180 --> 03:24:26.013
<v Speaker 8>I don't remember this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This was in the early days when it was </v>

4290
03:24:30.341 --> 03:24:32.090
<v Speaker 8>like sketchy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>sketchy,</v>

4291
03:24:32.100 --> 03:24:34.030
<v Speaker 8>regrow ops were sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He didn't want people to know.</v>

4292
03:24:34.031 --> 03:24:37.780
<v Speaker 8>Where you grow up was it wasn't legal </v>
<v Speaker 8>across the board.</v>

4293
03:24:37.900 --> 03:24:40.000
<v Speaker 8>You had to get a doctor's </v>
<v Speaker 8>recommendation.</v>

4294
03:24:40.030 --> 03:24:41.770
<v Speaker 8>I remember we walked into the doctor's </v>
<v Speaker 8>office.</v>

4295
03:24:41.790 --> 03:24:42.623
<v Speaker 8>Tell me if you remember this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was just cool black guy with </v>

4296
03:24:44.671 --> 03:24:47.850
<v Speaker 8>dreadlocks and he had one of those </v>
<v Speaker 8>volcano vapor bags,</v>

4297
03:24:47.851 --> 03:24:50.430
<v Speaker 8>but it was extra long.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He made an extra long bag,</v>

4298
03:24:50.610 --> 03:24:53.040
<v Speaker 8>like a normal volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Bay bags like that big.</v>

4299
03:24:53.160 --> 03:24:53.993
<v Speaker 8>He had one that was like three feet was.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was cartoonish and as soon as he saw </v>

4300
03:24:57.180 --> 03:24:59.250
<v Speaker 8>us like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>y'all look sick,</v>

4301
03:25:00.840 --> 03:25:02.820
<v Speaker 8>need medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 8>come on man,</v>

4302
03:25:02.821 --> 03:25:03.654
<v Speaker 8>y'all need to layer.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And it was baked out of his fucking </v>

4303
03:25:06.061 --> 03:25:06.894
<v Speaker 8>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was a legitimate doctor and he had </v>

4304
03:25:08.190 --> 03:25:09.180
<v Speaker 8>full on dreadlocks.</v>

4305
03:25:09.220 --> 03:25:09.881
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't me.</v>

4306
03:25:09.881 --> 03:25:11.460
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would not that.</v>

4307
03:25:11.470 --> 03:25:12.970
<v Speaker 2>That was not me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

4308
03:25:12.971 --> 03:25:13.930
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is healing.</v>

4309
03:25:13.931 --> 03:25:16.600
<v Speaker 2>I think it is a medicine and it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it's in Madison.</v>

4310
03:25:16.601 --> 03:25:19.240
<v Speaker 2>It is a medicine that heals people for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

4311
03:25:19.570 --> 03:25:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's not just a medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much more than that.</v>

4312
03:25:23.051 --> 03:25:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we just don't have the language to</v>
<v Speaker 2>describe what it is necessarily yet,</v>

4313
03:25:27.220 --> 03:25:30.220
<v Speaker 2>but people aren't or aren't taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iowasca to field good.</v>

4314
03:25:30.430 --> 03:25:34.000
<v Speaker 2>But it's not like a recreational drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4315
03:25:34.001 --> 03:25:35.320
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you there,</v>

4316
03:25:35.321 --> 03:25:36.154
<v Speaker 2>but I think that a lot of people are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily taking Iowasca because they </v>

4317
03:25:39.881 --> 03:25:40.714
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want something more out of their </v>

4318
03:25:42.281 --> 03:25:43.070
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to.</v>

4319
03:25:43.070 --> 03:25:46.660
<v Speaker 2>They were or they want some novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want a heightened experience.</v>

4320
03:25:46.661 --> 03:25:47.494
<v Speaker 2>Many people are taking your Iwatch is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're chronically fucking depressed </v>

4321
03:25:50.381 --> 03:25:51.214
<v Speaker 2>and they're desperate and they need help</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the people who are administering it </v>

4322
03:25:53.741 --> 03:25:55.500
<v Speaker 2>that are legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4323
03:25:55.510 --> 03:25:56.490
<v Speaker 2>they're like dog.</v>

4324
03:25:56.530 --> 03:25:57.363
<v Speaker 2>They're like doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their understanding of these plants is </v>

4325
03:26:00.360 --> 03:26:03.930
<v Speaker 2>as astounding and deep and I get all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and,</v>

4326
03:26:03.950 --> 03:26:04.650
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4327
03:26:04.650 --> 03:26:05.770
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm so.</v>

4328
03:26:05.771 --> 03:26:08.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly not opposed to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>concept.</v>

4329
03:26:08.141 --> 03:26:11.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying the term plant medicine </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

4330
03:26:11.710 --> 03:26:16.710
<v Speaker 2>it feels like somehow it's less romantic</v>
<v Speaker 2>than I picture psychedelics,</v>

4331
03:26:17.090 --> 03:26:20.020
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics or a combination,</v>

4332
03:26:20.350 --> 03:26:23.080
<v Speaker 2>a hedonic tool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a portal,</v>

4333
03:26:23.350 --> 03:26:26.050
<v Speaker 2>a means of communion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a spiritual practice,</v>

4334
03:26:26.330 --> 03:26:28.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also in medicine.</v>

4335
03:26:28.271 --> 03:26:29.620
<v Speaker 2>But there are all those other things </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

4336
03:26:29.621 --> 03:26:32.110
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's more than a medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

4337
03:26:32.111 --> 03:26:34.480
<v Speaker 2>It's something bigger than medicine </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

4338
03:26:34.481 --> 03:26:36.940
<v Speaker 2>All those things I just mentioned you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could call it medicine.</v>

4339
03:26:37.210 --> 03:26:38.043
<v Speaker 2>It's just reducing either some expansion</v>
<v Speaker 2>of healing to that goes beyond the </v>

4340
03:26:40.961 --> 03:26:44.260
<v Speaker 2>physical and into the psychological and </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional and spiritual,</v>

4341
03:26:44.261 --> 03:26:46.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which makes me sound like a Hippie,</v>

4342
03:26:46.571 --> 03:26:47.404
<v Speaker 2>but I just got schooled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was using the term hallucinogens </v>

4343
03:26:51.370 --> 03:26:52.203
<v Speaker 2>reflexively and I had Jim Fadiman on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast who's the microdosing guru and </v>

4344
03:26:57.341 --> 03:26:59.260
<v Speaker 2>he very quickly said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4345
03:26:59.320 --> 03:27:00.670
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Scott,</v>

4346
03:27:00.680 --> 03:27:01.890
<v Speaker 2>a lot of baggage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hulu,</v>

4347
03:27:01.930 --> 03:27:04.560
<v Speaker 2>because you don't actually hallucinate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4348
03:27:04.570 --> 03:27:05.410
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4349
03:27:05.411 --> 03:27:06.650
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelics is,</v>

4350
03:27:06.910 --> 03:27:09.220
<v Speaker 2>is definitely a better word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a better term.</v>

4351
03:27:09.240 --> 03:27:13.740
<v Speaker 8>But what is happening when you're </v>
<v Speaker 8>closing your eyes when you're doing dmt?</v>

4352
03:27:14.220 --> 03:27:18.480
<v Speaker 8>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's entirely likely that we don't know.</v>

4353
03:27:18.720 --> 03:27:19.553
<v Speaker 8>And that you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you might be actually interfacing with </v>

4354
03:27:21.481 --> 03:27:22.314
<v Speaker 8>some other place,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you're seeing things that seemed </v>

4355
03:27:24.901 --> 03:27:26.580
<v Speaker 8>like they must be hallucinations.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4356
03:27:26.770 --> 03:27:27.603
<v Speaker 8>It seems like something is interacting </v>
<v Speaker 8>with your visual perception abilities </v>

4357
03:27:31.291 --> 03:27:33.600
<v Speaker 8>where your eyes are seeing things that </v>
<v Speaker 8>are impossible.</v>

4358
03:27:33.930 --> 03:27:34.763
<v Speaker 8>Now is that because you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 8>there and you actually are experiencing </v>

4359
03:27:36.691 --> 03:27:40.950
<v Speaker 8>these impossible things or is it a trick</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's happening with chemicals and your</v>

4360
03:27:40.960 --> 03:27:44.730
<v Speaker 8>eyeballs and your brain and </v>
<v Speaker 8>neurochemistry and that's.</v>

4361
03:27:44.990 --> 03:27:47.510
<v Speaker 8>That's a question to be answered by </v>
<v Speaker 8>people far smarter than I.</v>

4362
03:27:47.560 --> 03:27:49.930
<v Speaker 8>and what is the difference between those</v>
<v Speaker 8>two things?</v>

4363
03:27:49.960 --> 03:27:53.410
<v Speaker 8>To what extent is your experience your </v>
<v Speaker 8>reality?</v>

4364
03:27:53.440 --> 03:27:54.520
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's the real question,</v>

4365
03:27:54.521 --> 03:27:56.440
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>We want to think that if you can't weigh</v>

4366
03:27:56.441 --> 03:27:58.990
<v Speaker 8>something on a scale,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if I can bang on it with a hammer,</v>

4367
03:27:58.991 --> 03:28:01.210
<v Speaker 8>if I can't draw on it with a marker,</v>
<v Speaker 8>then it's not a real thing.</v>

4368
03:28:01.320 --> 03:28:02.130
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right,</v>

4369
03:28:02.130 --> 03:28:04.180
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But if you said this,</v>

4370
03:28:04.181 --> 03:28:05.014
<v Speaker 8>like if you had an experience with God </v>
<v Speaker 8>where you literally were transported </v>

4371
03:28:07.811 --> 03:28:08.644
<v Speaker 8>into heaven and you had a communication </v>
<v Speaker 8>with God and then God gave you love and </v>

4372
03:28:11.921 --> 03:28:12.754
<v Speaker 8>wisdom and then you came back down to </v>
<v Speaker 8>Earth into your body and you this </v>

4373
03:28:17.410 --> 03:28:18.243
<v Speaker 8>actually did happen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or you took a drug and the exact same </v>

4374
03:28:21.491 --> 03:28:26.491
<v Speaker 8>experience took place in every way,</v>
<v Speaker 8>shape and form the exact amount of time,</v>

4375
03:28:27.070 --> 03:28:29.800
<v Speaker 8>the exact feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the exact message,</v>

4376
03:28:29.890 --> 03:28:30.723
<v Speaker 8>the exact visuals,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the exact reexamining of your life when </v>

4377
03:28:33.401 --> 03:28:35.740
<v Speaker 8>you return,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're basically the same thing.</v>

4378
03:28:36.040 --> 03:28:38.710
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if less you could get God in one of them</v>

4379
03:28:38.711 --> 03:28:39.544
<v Speaker 8>tuna nets and bring them back here so I </v>
<v Speaker 8>could prove that you had God and that </v>

4380
03:28:43.331 --> 03:28:47.290
<v Speaker 8>you weren't just tripping your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 8>balls off basically telling me a story,</v>

4381
03:28:47.291 --> 03:28:48.000
<v Speaker 8>Bro.</v>

4382
03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:49.170
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that'd be pissed.</v>

4383
03:28:49.220 --> 03:28:50.450
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4384
03:28:50.470 --> 03:28:51.630
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

4385
03:28:51.631 --> 03:28:52.464
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure that there's like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 7>scientific materialist hearing that and </v>

4386
03:28:54.451 --> 03:28:55.410
<v Speaker 7>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're,</v>

4387
03:28:55.440 --> 03:28:56.760
<v Speaker 7>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're assholes.</v>

4388
03:28:56.761 --> 03:29:00.780
<v Speaker 7>Or like squeezing into their body.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just in horror what you're saying,</v>

4389
03:29:00.781 --> 03:29:02.430
<v Speaker 7>because it's like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're like,</v>

4390
03:29:02.460 --> 03:29:03.293
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the difference is like when you have a </v>

4391
03:29:05.311 --> 03:29:06.144
<v Speaker 7>dream and you have this incredible dream</v>
<v Speaker 7>or a unicorn comes out of the clearing </v>

4392
03:29:10.081 --> 03:29:12.690
<v Speaker 7>in the forest and like a rainbow shoots </v>
<v Speaker 7>out of it's worn,</v>

4393
03:29:12.930 --> 03:29:17.310
<v Speaker 7>and then it turns into a swarm of </v>
<v Speaker 7>fireflies that spell I love you.</v>

4394
03:29:17.700 --> 03:29:18.780
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's like,</v>

4395
03:29:18.980 --> 03:29:20.820
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a really cool dream,</v>

4396
03:29:20.920 --> 03:29:22.860
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But that's not real.</v>

4397
03:29:23.100 --> 03:29:23.933
<v Speaker 7>That didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's completely different than if </v>

4398
03:29:25.831 --> 03:29:27.900
<v Speaker 7>you went into a clearing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4399
03:29:28.040 --> 03:29:30.510
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and saw a fucking Unicorn because if you</v>

4400
03:29:30.511 --> 03:29:32.490
<v Speaker 7>can go into clearing and see a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>Unicorn,</v>

4401
03:29:33.150 --> 03:29:36.000
<v Speaker 7>tell me where the clearing is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's get some nets.</v>

4402
03:29:36.310 --> 03:29:37.970
<v Speaker 8>Another thing too about,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

4403
03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:42.530
<v Speaker 8>here's the thing about mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 8>mushrooms enough to stop and think about</v>

4404
03:29:42.531 --> 03:29:45.010
<v Speaker 8>the people that wrote the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Stop to think about the people that have</v>

4405
03:29:45.020 --> 03:29:47.720
<v Speaker 8>discovered mushrooms a long time ago by </v>
<v Speaker 8>trial and error,</v>

4406
03:29:47.721 --> 03:29:48.554
<v Speaker 8>or whatever the method was.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And imagine everybody decided to get </v>

4407
03:29:51.051 --> 03:29:51.884
<v Speaker 8>together in some field somewhere and you</v>
<v Speaker 8>all take these mushrooms and you all </v>

4408
03:29:54.891 --> 03:29:58.400
<v Speaker 8>literally go to heaven and you have this</v>
<v Speaker 8>insane experience.</v>

4409
03:29:58.401 --> 03:29:59.234
<v Speaker 8>And then you all come back and then you </v>
<v Speaker 8>have to write about it in your ancient </v>

4410
03:30:01.971 --> 03:30:02.804
<v Speaker 8>tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You have to write this down in Aramaic </v>

4411
03:30:06.080 --> 03:30:06.913
<v Speaker 8>on animal skins.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You roll these up and put them in clay </v>

4412
03:30:09.711 --> 03:30:10.544
<v Speaker 8>jars in the caves of Qumran so that </v>
<v Speaker 8>someone someday will know this and </v>

4413
03:30:14.331 --> 03:30:15.860
<v Speaker 8>understand what you've been through.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

4414
03:30:15.861 --> 03:30:18.620
<v Speaker 8>when the drought came,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the mushrooms went away and we were left</v>

4415
03:30:18.621 --> 03:30:19.454
<v Speaker 8>with nothing but stories mean you have </v>
<v Speaker 8>to repeat the craziest thing about </v>

4416
03:30:23.241 --> 03:30:24.074
<v Speaker 8>psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 8>especially the natural ones that don't </v>

4417
03:30:25.131 --> 03:30:25.964
<v Speaker 8>kill anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is it somehow or another somebody wound </v>

4418
03:30:27.471 --> 03:30:28.304
<v Speaker 8>up bing enough people and putting off </v>
<v Speaker 8>disinformation out that one of the most </v>

4419
03:30:33.321 --> 03:30:34.154
<v Speaker 8>valuable things ever in for human </v>
<v Speaker 8>exploration ever as far as like the </v>

4420
03:30:37.851 --> 03:30:40.000
<v Speaker 8>exploration of our mind is the</v>

4421
03:30:40.010 --> 03:30:40.843
<v Speaker 9>one,</v>
<v Speaker 9>one of the most valuable things that's </v>

4422
03:30:42.201 --> 03:30:47.000
<v Speaker 9>ever existed for changing the way you </v>
<v Speaker 9>view the world,</v>

4423
03:30:47.150 --> 03:30:50.540
<v Speaker 9>giving you a reset.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The one though and doesn't kill anybody,</v>

4424
03:30:50.970 --> 03:30:51.803
<v Speaker 3>it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's illegal in societies that are </v>

4425
03:30:55.500 --> 03:30:58.890
<v Speaker 3>oriented in a way that that would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrosive.</v>

4426
03:30:59.370 --> 03:31:00.300
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

4427
03:31:00.330 --> 03:31:04.340
<v Speaker 3>that's why getting into legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's legal in Peru and</v>

4428
03:31:04.720 --> 03:31:07.220
<v Speaker 9>they just decriminalized lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And what is it,</v>

4429
03:31:07.221 --> 03:31:08.150
<v Speaker 9>Sweden?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Where do they do?</v>

4430
03:31:08.151 --> 03:31:10.190
<v Speaker 9>I think it was a switcher go.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Everything's legal.</v>

4431
03:31:10.191 --> 03:31:11.570
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Portugal's got it nailed.</v>

4432
03:31:11.630 --> 03:31:14.090
<v Speaker 9>I think in Sweden they made it a </v>
<v Speaker 9>misdemeanor to.</v>

4433
03:31:14.120 --> 03:31:14.953
<v Speaker 9>I can't remember somewhere recently.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They just made it a misdemeanor to have </v>

4434
03:31:19.730 --> 03:31:24.730
<v Speaker 9>to get caught with asset on the books </v>
<v Speaker 9>for the 2018 elections for California.</v>

4435
03:31:25.670 --> 03:31:26.503
<v Speaker 9>We have to organize like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this is something we really should </v>

4436
03:31:28.740 --> 03:31:32.060
<v Speaker 9>really should go after this.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like if you want to talk to me people,</v>

4437
03:31:32.061 --> 03:31:34.560
<v Speaker 9>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's going to go after military rooms.</v>

4438
03:31:35.090 --> 03:31:38.000
<v Speaker 9>Don't you really could change the world </v>
<v Speaker 9>and this is not bullshit.</v>

4439
03:31:38.001 --> 03:31:42.200
<v Speaker 9>If we organized and we got a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 9>people to vote yes,</v>

4440
03:31:42.201 --> 03:31:44.930
<v Speaker 9>on recreational use of mushrooms for </v>
<v Speaker 9>adults,</v>

4441
03:31:45.140 --> 03:31:47.030
<v Speaker 9>I literally think we could change the </v>
<v Speaker 9>world.</v>

4442
03:31:47.031 --> 03:31:47.864
<v Speaker 9>That would be the best.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It could change the world because like </v>

4443
03:31:49.700 --> 03:31:52.610
<v Speaker 9>medical marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it will spread to recreational marijuana</v>

4444
03:31:52.611 --> 03:31:53.444
<v Speaker 9>and recreational mushrooms get past and </v>
<v Speaker 9>if they do medical mushrooms get passed </v>

4445
03:31:56.781 --> 03:31:58.610
<v Speaker 9>and then they can start doing tests on </v>
<v Speaker 9>mushrooms.</v>

4446
03:31:58.880 --> 03:32:01.070
<v Speaker 9>Like the John Hopkins psilocybins </v>
<v Speaker 9>studies that they've done.</v>

4447
03:32:01.520 --> 03:32:03.680
<v Speaker 9>You would see literally a change in the </v>
<v Speaker 9>world.</v>

4448
03:32:03.681 --> 03:32:06.470
<v Speaker 9>You would see a shift in global </v>
<v Speaker 9>consciousness and that's not.</v>

4449
03:32:06.720 --> 03:32:10.700
<v Speaker 9>That's not a ridiculous thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's probably true.</v>

4450
03:32:10.730 --> 03:32:11.563
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why Tim scully and his partner </v>

4451
03:32:13.101 --> 03:32:15.470
<v Speaker 3>made all that orange sunshine acid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't.</v>

4452
03:32:15.471 --> 03:32:17.750
<v Speaker 3>I had him on my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's such a sweet guy.</v>

4453
03:32:18.140 --> 03:32:18.973
<v Speaker 3>I'm not interested in money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could have made tons of money doing </v>

4454
03:32:21.411 --> 03:32:22.244
<v Speaker 3>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was this child genius and he just </v>

4455
03:32:25.641 --> 03:32:29.270
<v Speaker 3>made the acid and went to prison for it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he wanted to change the world.</v>

4456
03:32:29.510 --> 03:32:30.620
<v Speaker 3>He really thought it would do it.</v>

4457
03:32:30.850 --> 03:32:35.420
<v Speaker 9>Know I've been talking to you through </v>
<v Speaker 9>email to William Leonard Pickard.</v>

4458
03:32:35.421 --> 03:32:37.260
<v Speaker 9>That dude who got busted with all that </v>
<v Speaker 9>acid.</v>

4459
03:32:37.280 --> 03:32:41.140
<v Speaker 9>He's in jail now for like a multiple </v>
<v Speaker 9>life sentences.</v>

4460
03:32:41.250 --> 03:32:42.083
<v Speaker 9>When they busted him,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he is the guy that was like the missile </v>

4461
03:32:43.491 --> 03:32:46.040
<v Speaker 9>silo that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh yeah.</v>

4462
03:32:46.370 --> 03:32:47.203
<v Speaker 9>Was the guy that had the girl that lived</v>
<v Speaker 9>with them and they were selling ecstasy </v>

4463
03:32:50.481 --> 03:32:52.220
<v Speaker 9>and someone tried to kill somebody or </v>
<v Speaker 9>something.</v>

4464
03:32:52.250 --> 03:32:54.640
<v Speaker 9>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Someone got.</v>

4465
03:32:54.680 --> 03:32:59.600
<v Speaker 9>The other guy got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That girl Rad the guy out and holy shit,</v>

4466
03:32:59.840 --> 03:33:01.610
<v Speaker 9>there's a great book he wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If you want to read it,</v>

4467
03:33:01.611 --> 03:33:02.444
<v Speaker 9>really trippy book,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he wrote this book called the Rose of </v>

4468
03:33:04.701 --> 03:33:09.701
<v Speaker 9>paraklesis and it's this really cool </v>
<v Speaker 9>book and it's kind of like flow.</v>

4469
03:33:09.830 --> 03:33:11.840
<v Speaker 9>It's very intense to read and the way </v>
<v Speaker 9>it's written,</v>

4470
03:33:11.841 --> 03:33:13.730
<v Speaker 9>it's really not.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But um,</v>

4471
03:33:14.270 --> 03:33:16.430
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's pretty interesting.</v>

4472
03:33:16.431 --> 03:33:18.850
<v Speaker 9>It's talking about sort of the life of </v>
<v Speaker 9>a,</v>

4473
03:33:18.940 --> 03:33:22.700
<v Speaker 9>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the setup is a guy's going to talk to an</v>

4474
03:33:22.701 --> 03:33:23.534
<v Speaker 9>lsd chemist and a who is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 9>explaining what it's like to have to be </v>

4475
03:33:29.211 --> 03:33:30.044
<v Speaker 9>a secret as you have to be if you're </v>
<v Speaker 9>manufacturing what he calls planetary </v>

4476
03:33:33.921 --> 03:33:36.860
<v Speaker 9>doses of Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is what they want planetary.</v>

4477
03:33:37.620 --> 03:33:37.980
<v Speaker 9>And that's</v>

4478
03:33:37.980 --> 03:33:38.813
<v Speaker 2>what they wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the idea is like let's </v>

4479
03:33:40.351 --> 03:33:41.184
<v Speaker 2>manufacturer planetary doses of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>substance to up shift the consciousness </v>

4480
03:33:45.240 --> 03:33:47.400
<v Speaker 2>of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things he says,</v>

4481
03:33:47.401 --> 03:33:48.234
<v Speaker 2>it's all very flowery and beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's talking about the lsd chemist </v>

4482
03:33:51.211 --> 03:33:53.460
<v Speaker 2>and people being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a for profit thing.</v>

4483
03:33:53.940 --> 03:33:54.661
<v Speaker 2>And he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4484
03:33:54.661 --> 03:33:55.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for us money is,</v>

4485
03:33:55.901 --> 03:34:00.660
<v Speaker 2>is just the ability to move around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you're an lsd chemist,</v>

4486
03:34:00.661 --> 03:34:02.100
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all very flowery writing,</v>

4487
03:34:02.101 --> 03:34:02.934
<v Speaker 2>but he says something along the lines of</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're standing next to the forge </v>

4488
03:34:06.331 --> 03:34:09.840
<v Speaker 2>of the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stop thinking about money as meaning</v>

4489
03:34:09.841 --> 03:34:12.480
<v Speaker 2>anything because you're breathing in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fumes.</v>

4490
03:34:12.660 --> 03:34:13.493
<v Speaker 2>You're broke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like constantly in contact with </v>

4491
03:34:15.331 --> 03:34:17.790
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like mind expanding substance.</v>

4492
03:34:17.940 --> 03:34:20.920
<v Speaker 2>And good luck when you're mid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4493
03:34:20.940 --> 03:34:25.170
<v Speaker 2>200 microgram trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck taking money seriously.</v>

4494
03:34:25.210 --> 03:34:29.340
<v Speaker 2>And that moment is this fucking Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4495
03:34:29.700 --> 03:34:31.520
<v Speaker 2>This stuff's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

4496
03:34:31.620 --> 03:34:32.520
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

4497
03:34:32.521 --> 03:34:34.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>

4498
03:34:34.111 --> 03:34:35.250
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there still is,</v>

4499
03:34:35.251 --> 03:34:36.630
<v Speaker 2>I hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there is,</v>

4500
03:34:36.631 --> 03:34:37.464
<v Speaker 2>but there are people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing psychedelics and putting </v>

4501
03:34:41.131 --> 03:34:44.520
<v Speaker 2>their entire lives at risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because they want to make money.</v>

4502
03:34:44.521 --> 03:34:45.354
<v Speaker 2>And it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they started off wanting to make </v>

4503
03:34:46.531 --> 03:34:47.364
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now that they're manufacturing it </v>

4504
03:34:48.871 --> 03:34:52.680
<v Speaker 2>because they know of all the ways to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shift human consciousness,</v>

4505
03:34:52.890 --> 03:34:54.870
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of ways theoretically to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

4506
03:34:54.871 --> 03:34:55.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4507
03:34:55.320 --> 03:34:56.153
<v Speaker 6>can you imagine being the person who's </v>
<v Speaker 6>responsible for literally like a </v>

4508
03:34:58.721 --> 03:35:01.960
<v Speaker 6>swimming pool filled with acid that will</v>
<v Speaker 6>change the world.</v>

4509
03:35:02.260 --> 03:35:02.891
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4510
03:35:02.891 --> 03:35:05.110
<v Speaker 6>like right in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you could get this,</v>

4511
03:35:05.260 --> 03:35:09.130
<v Speaker 6>there would be such a hiccup and shift </v>
<v Speaker 6>of culture.</v>

4512
03:35:09.280 --> 03:35:10.780
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know which way it would go.</v>

4513
03:35:10.781 --> 03:35:11.614
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how much schizophrenia you </v>

4514
03:35:13.091 --> 03:35:13.924
<v Speaker 6>would trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how many people would blow </v>

4515
03:35:15.041 --> 03:35:16.180
<v Speaker 6>fuses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

4516
03:35:16.360 --> 03:35:17.193
<v Speaker 6>but I do know that something would </v>
<v Speaker 6>happen and it will know about shy evil </v>

4517
03:35:19.541 --> 03:35:21.460
<v Speaker 6>times when this happened based or God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4518
03:35:21.461 --> 03:35:22.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

4519
03:35:22.070 --> 03:35:23.110
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4520
03:35:23.111 --> 03:35:23.944
<v Speaker 6>That's what they think happened with the</v>
<v Speaker 6>Salem witch trials that literally the </v>

4521
03:35:28.001 --> 03:35:30.370
<v Speaker 6>Erg gotten the Rod because of an early </v>
<v Speaker 6>frost.</v>

4522
03:35:30.371 --> 03:35:34.300
<v Speaker 6>Some new fungus had grown on some of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>bread and they were able to run tests on</v>

4523
03:35:34.301 --> 03:35:37.450
<v Speaker 6>it and they believe that it has lsd like</v>
<v Speaker 6>property to it.</v>

4524
03:35:37.580 --> 03:35:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4525
03:35:38.571 --> 03:35:39.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

4526
03:35:39.501 --> 03:35:40.334
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's certainly one of the potential </v>

4527
03:35:43.041 --> 03:35:45.940
<v Speaker 2>ways to like upshift consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Epi,</v>

4528
03:35:46.130 --> 03:35:51.130
<v Speaker 2>getting people having access to </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics in a consensual way.</v>

4529
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:52.423
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you're fucking chomping </v>

4530
03:35:53.541 --> 03:35:58.541
<v Speaker 2>polluted wheat and suddenly think your </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbors know fucking Satan.</v>

4531
03:35:58.730 --> 03:35:59.860
<v Speaker 2>Pretty scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

4532
03:35:59.880 --> 03:36:00.713
<v Speaker 2>that's different than like deciding to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take a psychedelic in a responsible way </v>

4533
03:36:04.461 --> 03:36:05.294
<v Speaker 2>and then understanding a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how to be compassionate or </v>

4534
03:36:08.571 --> 03:36:09.710
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4535
03:36:10.250 --> 03:36:14.030
<v Speaker 6>seeing yourself for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember seeing yourself though.</v>

4536
03:36:14.031 --> 03:36:16.580
<v Speaker 6>The first time I took mushrooms I saw </v>
<v Speaker 6>myself and I was like,</v>

4537
03:36:16.640 --> 03:36:18.380
<v Speaker 6>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's who I am.</v>

4538
03:36:18.810 --> 03:36:20.330
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you before you do it,</v>

4539
03:36:20.331 --> 03:36:21.164
<v Speaker 6>it's like you have this idea looking in </v>
<v Speaker 6>out and then you are separated from all </v>

4540
03:36:25.911 --> 03:36:26.744
<v Speaker 6>of your life and you're like this entity</v>
<v Speaker 6>observing from the outside your life </v>

4541
03:36:31.071 --> 03:36:34.040
<v Speaker 6>yourself is the first time I ever </v>
<v Speaker 6>considered myself outside of myself.</v>

4542
03:36:34.240 --> 03:36:35.580
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

4543
03:36:35.590 --> 03:36:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

4544

<v Speaker 7>but one of the grading under his beads,</v>

4546
03:36:40.510 --> 03:36:43.270
<v Speaker 7>one of the great stories is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>great stories is that,</v>

4549
03:36:47.081 --> 03:36:49.900
<v Speaker 7>his guru twice,</v>
<v Speaker 7>first time,</v>

4550
03:36:49.901 --> 03:36:51.970
<v Speaker 7>and you can find a youtube video of him </v>
<v Speaker 7>telling the story.</v>

4551
03:36:51.971 --> 03:36:53.410
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It gives him like,</v>

4552
03:36:53.800 --> 03:36:54.910
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Owsley,</v>

4554
03:37:00.341 --> 03:37:01.174
<v Speaker 7>incredible lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Says it's 300 microgram tablets made by </v>

4555
03:37:04.601 --> 03:37:05.434
<v Speaker 7>one of the great lsd chemist of our time</v>
<v Speaker 7>and he's going to need to give it to </v>

4556
03:37:08.501 --> 03:37:12.760
<v Speaker 7>people and he gives it to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He gives a 600 micrograms to Neem Karoli</v>

4557
03:37:12.761 --> 03:37:15.340
<v Speaker 7>Baba.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now 600 micrograms is like,</v>

4558
03:37:15.430 --> 03:37:16.720
<v Speaker 7>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fuck that.</v>

03:37:16.780 --> 03:37:19.480
<v Speaker 7>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's just too much.</v>

4560
03:37:19.600 --> 03:37:22.900
<v Speaker 7>And neem Karoli Baba eats it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But the way he's eating it,</v>

4561
03:37:22.901 --> 03:37:25.840
<v Speaker 7>as he's like doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>throwing it in his mouth and eats it,</v>

4562
03:37:25.841 --> 03:37:26.440
<v Speaker 7>nothing happens.</v>

4563
03:37:26.440 --> 03:37:28.450
<v Speaker 7>So Rom das gets back to the United </v>
<v Speaker 7>States.</v>

4564
03:37:28.451 --> 03:37:30.310
<v Speaker 7>He's telling one of his scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 7>friends,</v>

4565
03:37:30.550 --> 03:37:32.230
<v Speaker 7>this store and a science friends,</v>
<v Speaker 7>come on,</v>

4566
03:37:32.231 --> 03:37:34.510
<v Speaker 7>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He didn't fucking eat it.</v>

4567
03:37:34.960 --> 03:37:36.400
<v Speaker 7>He threw,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he palmed it.</v>

4568
03:37:36.401 --> 03:37:39.790
<v Speaker 7>He threw it over his shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This story is bullshit.</v>

4569
03:37:39.791 --> 03:37:43.030
<v Speaker 7>You got tricked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You got hoodwinked by fucking Bob out in</v>

4570
03:37:43.031 --> 03:37:44.380
<v Speaker 7>India.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're all out there.</v>

4571
03:37:44.530 --> 03:37:45.363
<v Speaker 7>They just want you to worship.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then they want you to think they're </v>

4572
03:37:46.361 --> 03:37:47.970
<v Speaker 7>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So like Rhonda is,</v>

4573
03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:52.660
<v Speaker 7>gets back to India the second time with </v>
<v Speaker 7>acid again.</v>

4574
03:37:52.840 --> 03:37:54.520
<v Speaker 7>And this guy named Karoli Baba says to </v>
<v Speaker 7>him,</v>

4575
03:37:54.940 --> 03:37:59.940
<v Speaker 7>when you were here last time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what did you give me around us as says,</v>

4576
03:38:01.690 --> 03:38:02.880
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I gave you lsd.</v>

4577
03:38:03.340 --> 03:38:06.810
<v Speaker 7>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>did I take it around?</v>

4578
03:38:06.830 --> 03:38:08.770
<v Speaker 7>The US is like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>

4579
03:38:09.460 --> 03:38:10.360
<v Speaker 7>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>give me more,</v>

4580
03:38:10.361 --> 03:38:11.800
<v Speaker 7>give me more.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it gives him more.</v>

4581
03:38:12.070 --> 03:38:14.110
<v Speaker 7>And he takes these pills,</v>
<v Speaker 7>puts them in his mouth,</v>

4582
03:38:14.650 --> 03:38:17.950
<v Speaker 7>chewing them up in front of him and </v>
<v Speaker 7>opens his mouth.</v>

4583
03:38:17.950 --> 03:38:22.570
<v Speaker 7>His mouth is coated with tablet acid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's taken a coordinator around us now,</v>

4584
03:38:22.870 --> 03:38:23.703
<v Speaker 7>900 Mike's of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so he goes under his blanket and </v>

4585
03:38:29.621 --> 03:38:31.870
<v Speaker 7>starts shaking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I know people now,</v>

4586
03:38:31.871 --> 03:38:35.020
<v Speaker 7>I've seen you saw this happen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not just him telling the story,</v>

4587
03:38:35.200 --> 03:38:37.180
<v Speaker 7>who saw it happen?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And they said like,</v>

4588
03:38:37.181 --> 03:38:40.150
<v Speaker 7>the fucking blood rushed out around us,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his face.</v>

4589
03:38:40.450 --> 03:38:41.470
<v Speaker 7>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh my God.</v>

4590
03:38:41.530 --> 03:38:42.520
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what have I done?</v>

4591
03:38:42.521 --> 03:38:44.980
<v Speaker 7>What was I fucking thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just drove this dude crate.</v>

4592
03:38:45.220 --> 03:38:46.053
<v Speaker 7>I essentially just gave an old man 900 </v>
<v Speaker 7>micrograms of fucking acid in the hills </v>

4593
03:38:50.291 --> 03:38:53.680
<v Speaker 7>of India and he's going to go fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>nuts and it's going to be my fault.</v>

4594
03:38:54.280 --> 03:38:55.360
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so,</v>

4595
03:38:55.361 --> 03:38:56.194
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>neem Karoli Baba comes out of the </v>

4596
03:38:57.011 --> 03:38:59.440
<v Speaker 7>blanket,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his eyes are back in his head,</v>

4597
03:38:59.441 --> 03:39:02.860
<v Speaker 7>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then he just goes back to completely</v>

4598
03:39:02.861 --> 03:39:04.510
<v Speaker 7>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nothing,</v>

4599
03:39:04.720 --> 03:39:07.030
<v Speaker 7>no effect.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he says to him,</v>

4600
03:39:07.031 --> 03:39:07.864
<v Speaker 7>so was he,</v>
<v Speaker 7>was he laughing what now he was putting </v>

4601
03:39:10.211 --> 03:39:11.400
<v Speaker 7>on?</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was playing on a fuck.</v>

4602
03:39:11.420 --> 03:39:13.590
<v Speaker 7>He was playing a joke to fuck with him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he,</v>

4603
03:39:13.600 --> 03:39:14.433
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4604
03:39:14.500 --> 03:39:15.333
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4605
03:39:15.670 --> 03:39:17.170
<v Speaker 7>he was just fucking with.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But what,</v>

4606
03:39:17.220 --> 03:39:17.780
<v Speaker 7>what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what,</v>

4607
03:39:17.780 --> 03:39:18.613
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what he said to him was really </v>

4608
03:39:20.381 --> 03:39:21.310
<v Speaker 7>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We said to him,</v>

4609
03:39:21.320 --> 03:39:22.840
<v Speaker 7>was this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he said,</v>

4610
03:39:22.841 --> 03:39:24.640
<v Speaker 7>we used it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They used to have something like this in</v>

4611
03:39:24.641 --> 03:39:27.010
<v Speaker 7>the Indus Valley and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4612
03:39:27.250 --> 03:39:30.640
<v Speaker 7>this will bring you into the presence of</v>
<v Speaker 7>Christ,</v>

4613
03:39:31.150 --> 03:39:34.130
<v Speaker 7>but you have to leave better</v>

4614
03:39:34.130 --> 03:39:36.990
<v Speaker 8>to become Christ than to hang out with </v>
<v Speaker 8>him.</v>

4615
03:39:37.720 --> 03:39:39.150
<v Speaker 8>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is.</v>

4616
03:39:39.510 --> 03:39:40.151
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

4617
03:39:40.151 --> 03:39:41.030
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That was his.</v>

4618
03:39:41.240 --> 03:39:43.910
<v Speaker 8>Because their premise was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is something like,</v>

4619
03:39:43.911 --> 03:39:47.930
<v Speaker 8>this is definitely a thing for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But there could be that thing.</v>

4620
03:39:47.960 --> 03:39:48.800
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4621
03:39:48.801 --> 03:39:49.820
<v Speaker 8>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That was the,</v>

4622
03:39:50.030 --> 03:39:51.340
<v Speaker 8>you can live there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4623
03:39:51.380 --> 03:39:52.213
<v Speaker 8>I think that we're entirely in prison </v>
<v Speaker 8>divide a wall of ideas and of behavior </v>

4624
03:39:58.431 --> 03:39:59.264
<v Speaker 8>and a momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And of culture and of conditioning and </v>

4625
03:40:01.970 --> 03:40:05.120
<v Speaker 8>the way we look at the world is like in </v>
<v Speaker 8>these preprogram trunks,</v>

4626
03:40:05.121 --> 03:40:05.954
<v Speaker 8>that's a car that's a building we,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think necessarily we see it for </v>

4627
03:40:09.531 --> 03:40:10.364
<v Speaker 8>what it really completely is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is some very strange temporary </v>

4628
03:40:15.141 --> 03:40:19.280
<v Speaker 8>life that no one has really defined the </v>
<v Speaker 8>meaning of it.</v>

4629
03:40:19.520 --> 03:40:20.353
<v Speaker 8>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're in infinity hurling through space </v>

4630
03:40:23.510 --> 03:40:24.343
<v Speaker 8>surrounding and giant nuclear explosion </v>
<v Speaker 8>rocketing through the universe and all </v>

4631
03:40:28.311 --> 03:40:29.000
<v Speaker 8>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Trying to make,</v>

4632
03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:29.833
<v Speaker 8>make sense of it all,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and in between there you've got cops </v>

4633
03:40:31.431 --> 03:40:32.960
<v Speaker 8>killing people in hallways.</v>

4634
03:40:33.300 --> 03:40:35.550
<v Speaker 8>You've got black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you've got a.</v>

4635
03:40:35.551 --> 03:40:36.384
<v Speaker 8>you've got every single possible </v>
<v Speaker 8>variation from furries to people that </v>

4636
03:40:41.600 --> 03:40:44.540
<v Speaker 8>it's their job to ticket street vendors </v>
<v Speaker 8>who don't have the right.</v>

4637
03:40:45.830 --> 03:40:46.663
<v Speaker 8>It'd be the whole thing is this entire </v>
<v Speaker 8>thing that we're experiencing is really </v>

4638
03:40:51.081 --> 03:40:51.914
<v Speaker 8>psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you weren't living life and if life </v>

4639
03:40:55.341 --> 03:40:56.174
<v Speaker 8>made way more sense,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like in the world that we're normally </v>

4640
03:40:59.991 --> 03:41:00.824
<v Speaker 8>accustomed to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is much more controlled and two </v>

4641
03:41:03.201 --> 03:41:05.870
<v Speaker 8>dimensional,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and you could see the world that we live</v>

4642
03:41:05.871 --> 03:41:06.704
<v Speaker 8>in for the very first time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You'd be overwhelmed by how insane it </v>

4643
03:41:09.471 --> 03:41:10.304
<v Speaker 8>is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You'd be overwhelmed by the </v>

4644
03:41:11.271 --> 03:41:14.030
<v Speaker 8>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We'd be overwhelmed by the Internet.</v>

4645
03:41:14.031 --> 03:41:14.864
<v Speaker 8>You'd be overwhelmed by language.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You'd be overwhelmed by feelings and </v>

4646
03:41:16.821 --> 03:41:19.400
<v Speaker 8>emotions and all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If we weren't used to it,</v>

4647
03:41:19.730 --> 03:41:21.050
<v Speaker 8>all of it will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whoa,</v>

4648
03:41:21.051 --> 03:41:23.960
<v Speaker 8>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like nonverbal expression.</v>

4649
03:41:24.020 --> 03:41:29.020
<v Speaker 8>People Strip clubs for race cars,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all of it planes.</v>

4650
03:41:29.640 --> 03:41:31.910
<v Speaker 8>Why don't they have metal tubes?</v>
<v Speaker 8>They flying through the air,</v>

4651
03:41:32.030 --> 03:41:34.490
<v Speaker 8>the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're just so used to all of it.</v>

4652
03:41:34.700 --> 03:41:35.533
<v Speaker 8>That life itself is very psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's just a psychedelic experience that </v>

4653
03:41:40.041 --> 03:41:40.874
<v Speaker 8>we've grown deeply accustomed to and I </v>
<v Speaker 8>think the psychedelic experience that </v>

4654
03:41:44.301 --> 03:41:45.950
<v Speaker 8>you have when you're on a heavy duty </v>
<v Speaker 8>thing,</v>

4655
03:41:45.951 --> 03:41:46.784
<v Speaker 8>like a dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's like you venture forth into a </v>

4656
03:41:50.031 --> 03:41:51.940
<v Speaker 8>dimension that you don't have context </v>
<v Speaker 8>for,</v>

4657
03:41:52.370 --> 03:41:54.650
<v Speaker 8>but you feel familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You feel familiar with it,</v>

4658
03:41:54.770 --> 03:41:55.603
<v Speaker 8>but you don't have context for it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't fit into your normal </v>

4659
03:41:57.441 --> 03:41:58.274
<v Speaker 8>patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but the normal patterns are just as </v>

4660
03:41:59.841 --> 03:42:00.830
<v Speaker 8>bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Man.</v>

4661
03:42:01.100 --> 03:42:01.933
<v Speaker 8>The normal patterns were taking liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How do these clear plastic things that </v>

4662
03:42:06.051 --> 03:42:06.884
<v Speaker 8>are made out of oil that somehow the </v>
<v Speaker 8>other they figured out to turn into a </v>

4663
03:42:10.340 --> 03:42:11.173
<v Speaker 8>clear plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Can we fill it up with liquids and you </v>

4664
03:42:13.311 --> 03:42:14.180
<v Speaker 8>drink them?</v>
<v Speaker 8>The Chuck?</v>

4665
03:42:14.181 --> 03:42:18.200
<v Speaker 8>These things and you follow the path of </v>
<v Speaker 8>this plastic bottle,</v>

4666
03:42:18.290 --> 03:42:19.123
<v Speaker 8>it might eventually wind up in some </v>
<v Speaker 8>seagulls gut choking to death in the </v>

4667
03:42:22.970 --> 03:42:23.570
<v Speaker 8>middle of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

4668
03:42:23.570 --> 03:42:25.710
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's bizarre,</v>

4669
03:42:25.820 --> 03:42:26.653
<v Speaker 8>but then also add to that that you're </v>
<v Speaker 8>melting into time to while you drink </v>

4670
03:42:29.781 --> 03:42:31.940
<v Speaker 8>from the bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're just not.</v>

4671
03:42:31.950 --> 03:42:32.040
<v Speaker 8>The</v>

4672
03:42:32.040 --> 03:42:32.873
<v Speaker 2>insanity that is bottle is like your </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottles mid process it somewhere from </v>

4673
03:42:37.350 --> 03:42:41.160
<v Speaker 2>some batch of gooey shit to being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottle to being in a seagulls.</v>

4674
03:42:41.161 --> 03:42:41.994
<v Speaker 2>Got You're mid process to honey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting funding getting </v>

4675
03:42:49.051 --> 03:42:50.640
<v Speaker 2>dissolved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

4676
03:42:50.760 --> 03:42:51.593
<v Speaker 2>You're mid process and and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like the sun and so is the fucking </v>

4677
03:42:55.081 --> 03:42:55.660
<v Speaker 2>sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

4678
03:42:55.660 --> 03:42:56.493
<v Speaker 2>the fun thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is something that occurred to me </v>

4679
03:42:58.051 --> 03:42:58.884
<v Speaker 2>when I was super high recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting in this fucking apartment </v>

4680
03:43:02.970 --> 03:43:05.580
<v Speaker 2>and then suddenly it dawned on me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

4681
03:43:05.760 --> 03:43:07.470
<v Speaker 2>how many other people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking live here?</v>

4682
03:43:07.800 --> 03:43:08.910
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

4683
03:43:08.911 --> 03:43:10.950
<v Speaker 2>how many people have lived here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm thinking,</v>

4684
03:43:10.951 --> 03:43:11.784
<v Speaker 2>how many conversations have happened in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking apartment where everybody </v>

4685
03:43:14.251 --> 03:43:16.200
<v Speaker 2>thought these were really serious </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations.</v>

4686
03:43:16.201 --> 03:43:16.621
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

4687
03:43:16.621 --> 03:43:18.420
<v Speaker 2>we're really getting into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4688
03:43:18.780 --> 03:43:20.160
<v Speaker 2>and then you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

4689
03:43:20.161 --> 03:43:20.994
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a little.</v>

4690
03:43:21.100 --> 03:43:24.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a little eddy of air spinning </v>
<v Speaker 2>around in this fucking apartment.</v>

4691
03:43:25.110 --> 03:43:27.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to leave and there's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be other little eddies of hair that spin</v>

4692
03:43:27.961 --> 03:43:28.794
<v Speaker 2>around in this apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The apartment's going to be around way </v>

4693
03:43:31.351 --> 03:43:33.450
<v Speaker 2>longer than any of those other eddies of</v>
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>

4694
03:43:33.451 --> 03:43:35.670
<v Speaker 2>So really just to add to what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

4695
03:43:35.671 --> 03:43:36.504
<v Speaker 2>the beauty of the glorious nature of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe versus our ability to </v>

4696
03:43:40.321 --> 03:43:43.140
<v Speaker 2>comprehend it is that we are so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>impermanent.</v>

4697
03:43:43.410 --> 03:43:48.300
<v Speaker 2>We are so impermanent and we are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fluid and we're so melting into time.</v>

4698
03:43:48.570 --> 03:43:49.403
<v Speaker 2>It's a really amazing thing that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>allow you and I and you say you say </v>

4699
03:43:52.411 --> 03:43:54.990
<v Speaker 2>we're used to it and sometimes I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4700
03:43:54.991 --> 03:43:57.090
<v Speaker 2>that must be it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think also there's a lot of eggs.</v>

4701
03:43:57.120 --> 03:43:59.910
<v Speaker 2>We're ignoring it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're numb to it.</v>

4702
03:44:00.150 --> 03:44:02.510
<v Speaker 2>It's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too overwhelmed.</v>

4703
03:44:02.610 --> 03:44:05.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think about hunter gatherers,</v>

4704
03:44:05.400 --> 03:44:08.280
<v Speaker 2>hunter gatherers lived in the world that</v>
<v Speaker 2>created them,</v>

4705
03:44:08.730 --> 03:44:10.620
<v Speaker 2>the world that they evolved in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4706
03:44:10.830 --> 03:44:11.663
<v Speaker 2>So it's the same world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your father and grandfather and great </v>

4707
03:44:13.441 --> 03:44:15.360
<v Speaker 2>grandfather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody lived in the same world,</v>

4708
03:44:15.510 --> 03:44:17.490
<v Speaker 2>so the skills you're born learning,</v>

4709
03:44:17.750 --> 03:44:18.583
<v Speaker 8>I grew up learning.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those are the skills that are </v>

4710
03:44:19.251 --> 03:44:20.084
<v Speaker 8>appropriate to your world where we're in</v>
<v Speaker 8>a world now where even people who are </v>

4711
03:44:25.431 --> 03:44:28.700
<v Speaker 8>alive are in a different world than the </v>
<v Speaker 8>one they were born into.</v>

4712
03:44:29.190 --> 03:44:31.460
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and where I grew up before the Internet,</v>

4713
03:44:31.480 --> 03:44:32.510
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is all new.</v>

4714
03:44:32.870 --> 03:44:34.670
<v Speaker 8>I was in my thirties when the shit </v>
<v Speaker 8>started.</v>

4715
03:44:34.730 --> 03:44:36.590
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So nuts and.</v>

4716
03:44:36.620 --> 03:44:38.870
<v Speaker 8>But people,</v>
<v Speaker 8>younger people can't imagine what it was</v>

4717
03:44:38.871 --> 03:44:41.520
<v Speaker 8>like to travel before there was email.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4718
03:44:41.521 --> 03:44:44.060
<v Speaker 8>So you were like 40 when the first </v>
<v Speaker 8>iphone came out,</v>

4719
03:44:44.061 --> 03:44:45.040
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was born in [inaudible].</v>

4720
03:44:45.041 --> 03:44:46.430
<v Speaker 8>Sixty two.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4721
03:44:47.330 --> 03:44:48.163
<v Speaker 8>So the whole thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's hard to imagine it being any </v>

4722
03:44:51.291 --> 03:44:52.124
<v Speaker 8>different than it is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but if you really just think of what it </v>

4723
03:44:55.461 --> 03:44:56.120
<v Speaker 8>is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'll either,</v>

4724
03:44:56.120 --> 03:44:56.953
<v Speaker 8>just the discussions that we've had here</v>
<v Speaker 8>today about what the potential issues </v>

4725
03:45:00.381 --> 03:45:01.214
<v Speaker 8>could be with ai,</v>
<v Speaker 8>with advancing technology that has not </v>

4726
03:45:04.131 --> 03:45:05.840
<v Speaker 8>been mapped out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not,</v>

4727
03:45:05.900 --> 03:45:06.733
<v Speaker 8>it's not going to be regulated as far as</v>
<v Speaker 8>how far innovation is allowed to </v>

4728
03:45:09.381 --> 03:45:10.490
<v Speaker 8>continue.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not going.</v>

4729
03:45:10.520 --> 03:45:11.353
<v Speaker 8>They're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're going to be so far ahead of the </v>

4730
03:45:12.831 --> 03:45:15.070
<v Speaker 8>people that understand the regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's get that.</v>

4731
03:45:15.170 --> 03:45:17.390
<v Speaker 8>Things are going to be coming out like </v>
<v Speaker 8>the Internet itself.</v>

4732
03:45:17.450 --> 03:45:18.283
<v Speaker 8>The Internet came out itself before they</v>
<v Speaker 8>really understood what the implications </v>

4733
03:45:20.361 --> 03:45:21.194
<v Speaker 8>were.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If the government could go back in time </v>

4734
03:45:22.820 --> 03:45:23.870
<v Speaker 8>and pull the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>

4735
03:45:23.871 --> 03:45:24.620
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>

4736
03:45:24.620 --> 03:45:26.630
<v Speaker 8>pop.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's talk about this first.</v>

4737
03:45:26.750 --> 03:45:30.160
<v Speaker 8>Pull that plug right out of the wall </v>
<v Speaker 8>before the Internet on aol</v>

4738
03:45:30.340 --> 03:45:33.940
<v Speaker 9>and let's just talk about what we're </v>
<v Speaker 9>going to do with this and let's,</v>

4739
03:45:33.970 --> 03:45:36.340
<v Speaker 9>let's manage this because let me show </v>
<v Speaker 9>you what it could be,</v>

4740
03:45:36.550 --> 03:45:40.090
<v Speaker 9>and then you'd see 25 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 9>people like holding on their phones,</v>

4741
03:45:40.091 --> 03:45:40.924
<v Speaker 9>walking into traffic and getting hit by </v>
<v Speaker 9>cars because they're so addicted to </v>

4742
03:45:43.601 --> 03:45:45.070
<v Speaker 9>checking their facebook fan,</v>
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

4743
03:45:45.640 --> 03:45:46.473
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's nuts.</v>

4744
03:45:46.810 --> 03:45:47.643
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Imagine if a drug could do with cell </v>

4745
03:45:48.581 --> 03:45:49.414
<v Speaker 9>phones.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Do imagine if a drug came along and the </v>

4746
03:45:51.281 --> 03:45:53.650
<v Speaker 9>drug made you like stare at your hands </v>
<v Speaker 9>all day,</v>

4747
03:45:53.910 --> 03:45:55.900
<v Speaker 9>that everybody was just like staring at </v>
<v Speaker 9>their hands.</v>

4748
03:45:56.680 --> 03:45:58.150
<v Speaker 9>It means like praying.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4749
03:45:58.151 --> 03:45:58.984
<v Speaker 9>The only.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The only thing difference is you are </v>

4750
03:46:00.131 --> 03:46:03.100
<v Speaker 9>getting some information,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I mean if there was a drug that came</v>

4751
03:46:03.101 --> 03:46:06.730
<v Speaker 9>along that made you want to stare at </v>
<v Speaker 9>your hands like 90 percent of the day,</v>

4752
03:46:07.010 --> 03:46:10.690
<v Speaker 9>like if you're playing video games,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're not getting any information.</v>

4753
03:46:10.930 --> 03:46:13.070
<v Speaker 9>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Porn.</v>

4754
03:46:13.450 --> 03:46:16.600
<v Speaker 9>Well they say the video games in some </v>
<v Speaker 9>ways are good for the site though.</v>

4755
03:46:16.810 --> 03:46:20.040
<v Speaker 9>Good for the psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They make it good for your mind.</v>

4756
03:46:20.050 --> 03:46:21.250
<v Speaker 9>Pilots.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4757
03:46:21.480 --> 03:46:21.910
<v Speaker 9>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4758
03:46:21.910 --> 03:46:22.743
<v Speaker 9>it's not good for my psyche getting my </v>
<v Speaker 9>fucking ass kicked at hearthstone where </v>

4759
03:46:25.341 --> 03:46:26.440
<v Speaker 9>this new expansion.</v>

4760
03:46:29.260 --> 03:46:32.050
<v Speaker 9>But very quickly the thing you're </v>
<v Speaker 9>talking about the um,</v>

4761
03:46:32.530 --> 03:46:33.970
<v Speaker 9>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

4762
03:46:34.040 --> 03:46:37.030
<v Speaker 9>the concept of a drug that makes you </v>
<v Speaker 9>stare at your hands.</v>

4763
03:46:37.990 --> 03:46:42.990
<v Speaker 9>I think our thoughts at one point like </v>
<v Speaker 9>the ability to think the way we do was a</v>

4764
03:46:43.181 --> 03:46:45.280
<v Speaker 9>new technology.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It started emerging.</v>

4765
03:46:45.281 --> 03:46:47.410
<v Speaker 9>And so like when you're caught up in </v>
<v Speaker 9>your thoughts,</v>

4766
03:46:48.100 --> 03:46:51.040
<v Speaker 9>what's the difference between that and </v>
<v Speaker 9>looking at your fucking cell phone?</v>

4767
03:46:51.280 --> 03:46:53.920
<v Speaker 9>Like when you get obsessed with your </v>
<v Speaker 9>thoughts and like,</v>

4768
03:46:53.980 --> 03:46:57.580
<v Speaker 9>cause I've noticed like whenever I get </v>
<v Speaker 9>really caught up in a flurry of thoughts</v>

4769
03:46:57.790 --> 03:46:58.623
<v Speaker 9>and I allow myself to really get lost in</v>
<v Speaker 9>the thing you're talking about the </v>

4770
03:47:00.971 --> 03:47:03.100
<v Speaker 9>simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the projection into the future.</v>

4771
03:47:03.370 --> 03:47:04.203
<v Speaker 9>You're 17 fights ahead with this person </v>
<v Speaker 9>because they said this thing that </v>

4772
03:47:07.211 --> 03:47:10.840
<v Speaker 9>they're never going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think that's a form of looking at your</v>

4773
03:47:10.841 --> 03:47:11.674
<v Speaker 9>cell phone only.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's the internal simulator inside the </v>

4774
03:47:13.991 --> 03:47:14.824
<v Speaker 9>neuro computer that your brain is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I don't think it's too much </v>

4775
03:47:17.381 --> 03:47:18.040
<v Speaker 9>different.</v>

4776
03:47:18.040 --> 03:47:18.873
<v Speaker 9>I think both of these things are just </v>
<v Speaker 9>different attempts to try to evade the </v>

4777
03:47:22.691 --> 03:47:23.524
<v Speaker 9>present moment because the present </v>
<v Speaker 9>moment is so overwhelmingly </v>

4778
03:47:26.681 --> 03:47:27.514
<v Speaker 9>heartbreakingly beautiful that we'd </v>
<v Speaker 9>rather have our faces buried in our </v>

4779
03:47:30.461 --> 03:47:31.294
<v Speaker 9>phones or in our thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think that's the problem is the more </v>

4780
03:47:33.941 --> 03:47:36.610
<v Speaker 9>that we get into the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's fucking amazing here.</v>

4781
03:47:36.640 --> 03:47:38.470
<v Speaker 9>It is amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I don't think that's what's.</v>

4782
03:47:38.650 --> 03:47:39.483
<v Speaker 9>I don't think it's the fact that it's </v>
<v Speaker 9>beautiful that's making people be </v>

4783
03:47:41.891 --> 03:47:42.724
<v Speaker 9>distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think overwhelming the amount of data </v>

4784
03:47:45.671 --> 03:47:48.340
<v Speaker 9>that's coming our way and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 9>we're designed for it.</v>

4785
03:47:48.341 --> 03:47:50.380
<v Speaker 9>I think that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 9>gets people at peace.</v>

4786
03:47:50.381 --> 03:47:54.010
<v Speaker 9>If you're on a hike in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this is all stuff where your brain has a</v>

4787
03:47:54.011 --> 03:47:55.780
<v Speaker 9>whole fort.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We're talking about keys,</v>

4788
03:47:56.190 --> 03:47:59.130
<v Speaker 9>keys at slots.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Those key is just fit in.</v>

4789
03:47:59.140 --> 03:48:00.490
<v Speaker 9>There's a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's the bird,</v>

4790
03:48:00.510 --> 03:48:02.170
<v Speaker 9>all of that eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Holy Shit.</v>

4791
03:48:02.171 --> 03:48:02.621
<v Speaker 9>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Look,</v>

4792
03:48:02.621 --> 03:48:05.320
<v Speaker 9>the salmon jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's there's keys for that.</v>

4793
03:48:05.350 --> 03:48:06.183
<v Speaker 9>There's receptors for all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 9>When you're walking down fucking Santa </v>

4794
03:48:11.050 --> 03:48:11.883
<v Speaker 9>Monica Boulevard and his people honking </v>
<v Speaker 9>their horn and different music is </v>

4795
03:48:13.571 --> 03:48:14.404
<v Speaker 9>playing in different cars and there's </v>
<v Speaker 9>smells that aren't natural and there's </v>

4796
03:48:18.221 --> 03:48:19.054
<v Speaker 9>so much data coming your way.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's overwhelming and then you're </v>

4797
03:48:21.161 --> 03:48:24.730
<v Speaker 9>thinking about your work and your job </v>
<v Speaker 9>and your boss keeps giving you massages.</v>

4798
03:48:25.600 --> 03:48:27.050
<v Speaker 9>Creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know?</v>

4799
03:48:27.330 --> 03:48:28.730
<v Speaker 9>You just want to.</v>

4800
03:48:29.120 --> 03:48:33.060
<v Speaker 3>When it gets back to that natural,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unnatural conversation we began with,</v>

4801
03:48:33.070 --> 03:48:34.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you know you're.</v>

4802
03:48:35.420 --> 03:48:36.253
<v Speaker 3>You're describing the metaphor of </v>
<v Speaker 3>receptor cells or something for these </v>

4803
03:48:38.601 --> 03:48:39.434
<v Speaker 3>different inputs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but another way to look at it is your </v>

4804
03:48:41.661 --> 03:48:44.270
<v Speaker 3>body has expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4805
03:48:44.271 --> 03:48:45.104
<v Speaker 3>Your eyes are designed with an </v>
<v Speaker 3>expectation of certain wavelengths of </v>

4806
03:48:49.911 --> 03:48:53.840
<v Speaker 3>light that are relevant to this animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4807
03:48:53.841 --> 03:48:54.674
<v Speaker 3>Those are like the reds of the berries </v>
<v Speaker 3>are relevant because now they're ripe </v>

4808
03:48:57.021 --> 03:48:59.990
<v Speaker 3>and you know there are different than </v>
<v Speaker 3>blood is shocking and all that.</v>

4809
03:49:00.530 --> 03:49:01.363
<v Speaker 3>The ears are expectations of certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>decibel levels that would be important </v>

4810
03:49:04.791 --> 03:49:07.860
<v Speaker 3>for this animal to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rabbits I've totally different setup,</v>

4811
03:49:07.861 --> 03:49:09.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so your whole body,</v>

4812
03:49:09.651 --> 03:49:12.560
<v Speaker 3>your lungs or an expectation of oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rich air,</v>

4813
03:49:12.561 --> 03:49:15.950
<v Speaker 3>you know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you take that animal out,</v>

4814
03:49:16.370 --> 03:49:20.060
<v Speaker 3>it's confused because what it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>expecting isn't there.</v>

4815
03:49:20.240 --> 03:49:22.650
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just metaphorical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4816
03:49:22.651 --> 03:49:23.484
<v Speaker 3>it's actually physiologically we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>living in a world that our bodies don't </v>

4817
03:49:26.631 --> 03:49:27.770
<v Speaker 3>expect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

4818
03:49:28.150 --> 03:49:28.983
<v Speaker 9>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 9>What a great way to end this thing </v>

4819
03:49:31.390 --> 03:49:33.820
<v Speaker 9>sitting for five hours.</v>
<v Speaker 9>This was fun.</v>

4820
03:49:34.030 --> 03:49:36.250
<v Speaker 9>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Thank you guys.</v>

4821
03:49:36.251 --> 03:49:38.120
<v Speaker 9>Let's do this more often.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Make these easy.</v>

4822
03:49:38.121 --> 03:49:41.330
<v Speaker 9>We can all just will triple cast it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You want to do that while three?</v>

4823
03:49:41.510 --> 03:49:42.880
<v Speaker 9>Put it out,</v>
<v Speaker 9>put it.</v>

4824
03:49:42.890 --> 03:49:43.910
<v Speaker 9>We'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Whatever time.</v>

4825
03:49:44.300 --> 03:49:46.810
<v Speaker 9>I think that's probably the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 9>do it all the time.</v>

4826
03:49:47.220 --> 03:49:48.053
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4827
03:49:48.140 --> 03:49:51.170
<v Speaker 9>So that way nobody has to miss any of </v>
<v Speaker 9>them or not subscribed.</v>

4828
03:49:51.200 --> 03:49:53.240
<v Speaker 9>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you guys are both here.</v>

4829
03:49:53.241 --> 03:49:55.630
<v Speaker 9>Now you're here,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're moving back.</v>

4830
03:49:55.631 --> 03:49:57.350
<v Speaker 9>I'm back,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're done and you're here.</v>

4831
03:49:57.640 --> 03:50:02.640
<v Speaker 9>So unless I get kidnapped and Peru and a</v>
<v Speaker 9>little bit more often,</v>

4832
03:50:03.440 --> 03:50:04.273
<v Speaker 9>there's some of my favorite podcast ever</v>
<v Speaker 9>that Chris Ryan on twitter and the </v>

4833
03:50:09.010 --> 03:50:09.890
<v Speaker 9>instagram.</v>

<v Speaker 9>Alright fuckers.</v>
