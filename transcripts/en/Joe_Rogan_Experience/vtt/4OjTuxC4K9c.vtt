<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

27
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a frat house there.</v>

28
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:18.090
<v Speaker 1>The way you're going through raisin</v>
<v Speaker 1>brand and Fritos and I'm a mess.</v>

29
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.420
<v Speaker 1>You know I didn't have to feed us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had a lay's potato chips,</v>

30
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 1>like potato chips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did knock down,</v>

31
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I knocked down a pack of m cool ranch</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doritos.</v>

32
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>They weren't how I remembered him when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was when I was like 11 and those came</v>

33
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:32.280
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were the greatest thing of all</v>

34
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

35
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something happened to them.</v>

36
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>You know what I think as you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a young kid and you eat</v>

37
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>something terrible for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Ding Dong or ring ding,</v>

38
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>you know those things they see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel so good when you're eating</v>

39
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel so good.</v>

40
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea that you could just take</v>
<v Speaker 1>that white plastic wrap or rip it open</v>

41
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.550
<v Speaker 1>and that chocolate delicious hockey puck</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the cream inside of it was there.</v>

42
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't give a fuck about your house.</v>

43
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.080
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to eat this thing right now,</v>

44
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>and he gets so excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as you get older,</v>

45
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:06.610
<v Speaker 1>and we talked about that this weekend</v>
<v Speaker 1>used,</v>

46
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 1>you kind of recognize what's happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do something more like you're</v>

47
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:14.320
<v Speaker 1>more in tune with like what nutrients</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're putting in your body and what,</v>

48
00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>what their effect has on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

49
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Big Time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you start to,</v>

50
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>it's funny how your taste buds change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recently started liking onions and</v>

51
00:02:23.491 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>didn't and mushrooms and they were the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only two things I did not like it all.</v>

52
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>You remember when you were asking me</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the morels and you couldn't</v>

53
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:31.290
<v Speaker 1>believe that I didn't like Morel</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mushrooms.</v>

54
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>I actually had some mushrooms in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

55
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>some type of an oriental dish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also I'm like,</v>

56
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>what the heck it tasted for the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time when I tasted a mushroom,</v>

57
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>it didn't just tastes like mush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It literally had a flavor.</v>

58
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.030
<v Speaker 1>So I've included them on my meals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm at a steak restaurant or</v>

59
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 1>something and I genuinely are liking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>taste of mushrooms now.</v>

60
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your tastebud shifted.</v>

61
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or boy,</v>

62
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 3>Harry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just also now know or started really</v>

63
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 3>liking green peppers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

64
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no where it's a mystery.</v>

65
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.510
<v Speaker 1>It is a mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

66
00:03:09.511 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I've always wondered like what?</v>

67
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>When people enjoy something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really strange,</v>

68
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>like in Iceland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this really bizarre pickled</v>

69
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>shark that is supposed to be atrocious</v>
<v Speaker 1>for everybody,</v>

70
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>but people from Iceland it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

71
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like pickled herring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every something way more intense.</v>

72
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be like really intense</v>
<v Speaker 1>like shark.</v>

73
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fermented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if you could find it,</v>

74
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be levels,</v>

75
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gusting.</v>

76
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think when you hear blood</v>

77
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:41.730
<v Speaker 1>pudding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you intro,</v>

78
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

79
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>and there's people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got friends in England that love,</v>

80
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>they love blood pudding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

81
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 1>they're in the sausages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>like blood sausages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had that.</v>

83
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 1>They love it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have our own dean on eating Icelandic</v>

84
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>delicacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fermented shark.</v>

85
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Never forget an Anthony Bourdain had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he had to go there to try that.</v>

86
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.080
<v Speaker 1>If he says never again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never again did.</v>

87
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>shifted how they feel about sharks.</v>

88
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have as well.</v>

89
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I've had Maaco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people have shifted how they feel</v>

90
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:21.190
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this right up there with</v>

91
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:25.290
<v Speaker 1>airplane food in Nambia and ward hog</v>
<v Speaker 1>rectum according to CPS.</v>

92
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>He's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny man.</v>

93
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>What have weird things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they figured out some way to make</v>

94
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>shark tastes just disgusting and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it.</v>

95
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.760
<v Speaker 1>They really enjoy it and if they want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>claim it will give them that.</v>

96
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what the fuck is going on in their</v>

97
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:42.514
<v Speaker 1>head?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like did,</v>

98
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I just would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

99
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look we can assume that you taste things</v>

100
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 1>the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I taste things that can't be the case</v>

101
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>cause I like things that people hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I like certain hot foods that some</v>

102
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 1>people just despise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how the fuck do I know what they're</v>

103
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:58.210
<v Speaker 1>experiencing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very weird.</v>

104
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.880
<v Speaker 3>One time Sharon and I were out to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuddrucker's the hamburger place and her</v>

105
00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:07.881
<v Speaker 3>mom was there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were doing the machine and Sharon's</v>

106
00:05:08.311 --> 00:05:12.420
<v Speaker 3>like she was putting in like the cherry</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of Cherry coke cause you select</v>

107
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:13.550
<v Speaker 3>your flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So right.</v>

108
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.300
<v Speaker 3>The chair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she literally made this cherry coke and</v>

109
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:17.730
<v Speaker 3>her and her mom's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was that?</v>

110
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:19.050
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cherry coke.</v>

111
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.180
<v Speaker 3>You never had cherry coach like Oh my</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

112
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:24.030
<v Speaker 3>that's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While she says that she didn't have her</v>

113
00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:27.630
<v Speaker 3>glasses on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she literally pushes cherry coke and it</v>

114
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.240
<v Speaker 3>and she filled her cup with cherry coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Sharon,</v>

115
00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:32.580
<v Speaker 3>I kind of just looked at each other and</v>
<v Speaker 3>did this.</v>

116
00:05:32.581 --> 00:05:35.430
<v Speaker 3>We went back and sat down and she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

117
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.740
<v Speaker 3>she went through her coke like that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she was just staring.</v>

118
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.650
<v Speaker 3>She didn't know it was cherry coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

119
00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:44.400
<v Speaker 3>when we were doing it she asked because</v>
<v Speaker 3>she saw the red but when she did it,</v>

120
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.300
<v Speaker 3>yeah she didn't have her glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She selected that one.</v>

121
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah about halfway through the meal</v>

122
00:05:51.691 --> 00:05:54.120
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh isn't that coke just so good here</v>

123
00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:59.121
<v Speaker 3>cause she's from England and we said</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah it was cherry but she was totally</v>

124
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 3>stand off because she couldn't mentally</v>
<v Speaker 3>put together cherry and coke cause she</v>

125
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 3>had never tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's what it is.</v>

126
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 3>When people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh I hate venison.</v>

127
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Have they ever really had venison or at</v>
<v Speaker 3>least venison worthy eating?</v>

128
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.980
<v Speaker 4>Most people probably haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

129
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 4>I think it's probably really hard to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone to do it.</v>

130
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not commercially available.</v>

131
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 4>It's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

132
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 4>people have done it poorly and then you</v>
<v Speaker 4>get that weird,</v>

133
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm like a prejudice that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have of it being Gamey,</v>

134
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quote Unquote Gaming.</v>

135
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So untrue.</v>

136
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.740
<v Speaker 3>We uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have uh,</v>

137
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.110
<v Speaker 3>a big yeti out in the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>vehicle loaded with very fresh organic</v>

138
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.670
<v Speaker 4>swine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

139
00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:46.470
<v Speaker 4>Wild pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pigs are,</v>

140
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.570
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the weird ones that people,</v>

141
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.030
<v Speaker 4>some people are going to get upset if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have anything,</v>

142
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.440
<v Speaker 4>but if you want wild pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

143
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.090
<v Speaker 4>Like I have a very good friend who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an agent.</v>

144
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.820
<v Speaker 4>It's a very nice person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

145
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.820
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about hunting things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She goes to do you hunt pigs,</v>

146
00:07:02.821 --> 00:07:06.060
<v Speaker 4>you can hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pigs are ugly and she loves animals.</v>

147
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.630
<v Speaker 4>She loves them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But her immediate response was like,</v>

148
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.790
<v Speaker 4>fuck those pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

149
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.980
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that animal gets no,</v>

150
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.620
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so invasive that,</v>

151
00:07:16.621 --> 00:07:19.680
<v Speaker 4>and people recognize it for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the way you look at it.</v>

152
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't want it to say that I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 4>love for them.</v>

153
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.380
<v Speaker 4>I think it was cool even looking at him</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we saw a lot of cool.</v>

154
00:07:25.381 --> 00:07:27.270
<v Speaker 4>They're brilliant too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating.</v>

155
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was amazed at how smart they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were.</v>

156
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.850
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you send him that picture?</v>

157
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.610
<v Speaker 4>I put that on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

158
00:07:35.611 --> 00:07:37.140
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even see that.</v>

159
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.180
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have my cell phone didn't work</v>
<v Speaker 4>out there.</v>

160
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.800
<v Speaker 4>So this uh,</v>

161
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.900
<v Speaker 3>this is actually a female pig that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Steve stocked in on.</v>

162
00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:50.440
<v Speaker 3>I was filming right where I'm standing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you guys got so close and you could</v>

163
00:07:50.441 --> 00:07:53.740
<v Speaker 3>hear baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could hear piglets kind of</v>

164
00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:56.110
<v Speaker 3>squeaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you actually didn't you stand up with</v>

165
00:07:56.111 --> 00:07:57.610
<v Speaker 3>your camera and take a picture of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>nest</v>

166
00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.030
<v Speaker 4>and everything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah I did.</v>

167
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 4>And it stood up like 13 or 14 feet in</v>
<v Speaker 4>front of us.</v>

168
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.290
<v Speaker 4>It was so close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really close.</v>

169
00:08:07.291 --> 00:08:08.300
<v Speaker 4>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

170
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:08.830
<v Speaker 4>You kept,</v>

171
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.180
<v Speaker 3>you're cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people would,</v>

172
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.220
<v Speaker 3>would lose it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause they,</v>

173
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the damage for those of you who</v>

174
00:08:14.831 --> 00:08:16.900
<v Speaker 3>don't list or who are listening and</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know,</v>

175
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

176
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.450
<v Speaker 3>wild boars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely dangerous if they want to be</v>

177
00:08:22.451 --> 00:08:24.970
<v Speaker 3>their cutters on their bottom teeth</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause they,</v>

178
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.190
<v Speaker 3>they pop their teeth and when they do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

179
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.810
<v Speaker 3>they actually file that noise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is them filing their cutters.</v>

180
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.960
<v Speaker 3>And have you ever felt the inside of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>big doors cutter?</v>

181
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's literally like a knife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

182
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.480
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they come by,</v>

183
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:45.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean one little hit on the inside of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your leg and that's fatal potentially.</v>

184
00:08:45.911 --> 00:08:46.510
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

185
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.550
<v Speaker 4>a beast of an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're enormous.</v>

186
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.000
<v Speaker 4>What's really crazy is that they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>brought here.</v>

187
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.000
<v Speaker 4>A lot of it was by that William Randolph</v>
<v Speaker 4>hearst guy,</v>

188
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 4>that</v>

189
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.160
<v Speaker 5>Kooky bastard that was so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The William Randolph hearst guy who was</v>

190
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:03.900
<v Speaker 5>the guy that citizen Kane is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>based on,</v>

191
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Orson welles masterpiece.</v>

192
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:12.351
<v Speaker 5>Citizen Kane was based on this crazy guy</v>
<v Speaker 5>who also coincidentally a as the guy who</v>

193
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 5>campaigned to make weed illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was the guy that owned hearst</v>

194
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:21.150
<v Speaker 5>publications.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so he,</v>

195
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:23.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had this idea in his head,</v>

196
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 5>this is the story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was that hemp,</v>

197
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.870
<v Speaker 5>they're starting to make paper out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>hemp.</v>

198
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.470
<v Speaker 5>And he was threatened and there was like</v>
<v Speaker 5>a popular science magazine and said,</v>

199
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:34.380
<v Speaker 5>hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the new billion dollar corn crop because</v>

200
00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:37.200
<v Speaker 5>he owned like these fields of hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or excuse me,</v>

201
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:40.080
<v Speaker 5>these fields of trees they used to make</v>
<v Speaker 5>paper out of,</v>

202
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.510
<v Speaker 5>he owned paper mills and he own</v>
<v Speaker 5>newspaper.</v>

203
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.680
<v Speaker 5>So apparently his fear was in converting</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything to paper.</v>

204
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:50.810
<v Speaker 5>He would lose millions of dollars on all</v>
<v Speaker 5>his traditional trees that the user</v>

205
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.910
<v Speaker 5>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he started printing stories about</v>

206
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:58.911
<v Speaker 5>marijuana being this terrible thing and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Mexicans and black men are raping</v>

207
00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:00.090
<v Speaker 5>white women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And people went,</v>

208
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:02.730
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is this plot?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got to stop this right now.</v>

209
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.290
<v Speaker 5>And so they made the prohibition on</v>
<v Speaker 5>marijuana and it happened directly as a</v>

210
00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:11.370
<v Speaker 5>result.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the conspiracy theory of him</v>

211
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.840
<v Speaker 5>wanting to stop a competitor in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>paper business.</v>

212
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:20.720
<v Speaker 5>So it's so hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This one crazy fuck also brought over</v>

213
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 5>punch a wild boars and just let them run</v>
<v Speaker 5>loose so he could shoot them.</v>

214
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will now Texas is,</v>

215
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.190
<v Speaker 3>well the most of the south central us is</v>
<v Speaker 3>just overrun with them.</v>

216
00:10:30.191 --> 00:10:30.420
<v Speaker 3>People</v>

217
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 5>both don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like a giant rat.</v>

218
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.430
<v Speaker 5>It's like it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

219
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm not probing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing wrong with like,</v>

220
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:43.200
<v Speaker 5>we have like category categories and</v>
<v Speaker 5>categorizations of animals and like</v>

221
00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:47.040
<v Speaker 5>nobody minds if you kill a bug,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you get to a certain size thing like</v>

222
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.480
<v Speaker 5>people rat traps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

223
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.970
<v Speaker 5>you gotta do what you gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get bigger than a rat.</v>

224
00:10:50.971 --> 00:10:51.601
<v Speaker 5>And people go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

225
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:53.610
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

226
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:54.700
<v Speaker 5>And there's something weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

227
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 5>you get to like pigs and people go,</v>

229
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:06.530
<v Speaker 3>what their acceptance level was and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems like for sure things that we</v>

230
00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:11.961
<v Speaker 3>perceive as like ugly pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Turkeys look that way.</v>

231
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:13.171
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

232
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:15.690
<v Speaker 3>their heads are kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't look that cool when you look</v>

233
00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:17.370
<v Speaker 3>at them up close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've had good color.</v>

234
00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:21.330
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like Turkeys and pigs and even</v>

235
00:11:21.331 --> 00:11:23.310
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you both fish,</v>

236
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.870
<v Speaker 3>those are like entry level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm shooting something that people,</v>

237
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:32.340
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of the segue is turkeys or</v>
<v Speaker 3>hogs.</v>

238
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 3>Sharon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

239
00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:35.910
<v Speaker 3>my wife is from England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had never hunted.</v>

240
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.520
<v Speaker 3>My boy had never hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their family,</v>

241
00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:41.220
<v Speaker 3>had never been around hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they came here it was a whole</v>

242
00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:46.221
<v Speaker 3>new perspective of how many wild animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>are in you.</v>

243
00:11:46.391 --> 00:11:50.370
<v Speaker 3>No one in society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We almost hit several with our car when</v>

244
00:11:50.371 --> 00:11:52.800
<v Speaker 3>we lived in Wisconsin and then they just</v>
<v Speaker 3>started,</v>

245
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would just destroy any hopes of a</v>

246
00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 3>garden that we would have.</v>

247
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.560
<v Speaker 3>So Sharon started going out and filming</v>
<v Speaker 3>me on some hunts and one time we were on</v>

248
00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:06.100
<v Speaker 3>a hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Illinois and this dough comes running in</v>

249
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.630
<v Speaker 3>her tongue's hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three bucks come behind her and these</v>

250
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 3>books are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's literally trapped between three</v>

251
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:15.670
<v Speaker 3>bucks and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

252
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:17.980
<v Speaker 3>she's just wanting to get away or</v>
<v Speaker 3>tongues hanging out.</v>

253
00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:21.640
<v Speaker 3>She's not ready yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's three horny bucks there and</v>

254
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 3>she's just sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's obvious they had been running most</v>

255
00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 3>of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then two bucks started fighting.</v>

256
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:28.540
<v Speaker 3>One buck came in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of,</v>

257
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ended up kind of scooting her with his</v>

258
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:34.000
<v Speaker 3>horns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they were just running her</v>

259
00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Ragen and Sharon's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what the ruts like?</v>

260
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:37.901
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

261
00:12:37.901 --> 00:12:42.901
<v Speaker 3>the males literally just run the females</v>
<v Speaker 3>until they're like,</v>

262
00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:45.700
<v Speaker 3>have no choice but I have to breed right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

263
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:46.750
<v Speaker 3>And then it happens.</v>

264
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.090
<v Speaker 3>And then they're like onto the next</v>
<v Speaker 3>lady.</v>

265
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:53.140
<v Speaker 3>So she pleases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she says when she watched it,</v>

266
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:55.690
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she goes,</v>

267
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.140
<v Speaker 3>if I were to get into deer hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause at that time the only thing she</v>

268
00:12:59.141 --> 00:13:02.740
<v Speaker 3>had shot was a Turkey and then she</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunted,</v>

269
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wild hog and she goes,</v>

270
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 3>so if I go hunting for deer and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to do it,</v>

271
00:13:10.721 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 3>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would only want a buck.</v>

272
00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:13.540
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

273
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.403
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

274
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.290
<v Speaker 3>I was glad she had an open mind to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

275
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'd be helping helping a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sister out.</v>

276
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:25.480
<v Speaker 3>She kind of said it a funny way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

277
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:28.420
<v Speaker 3>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is like your friend at the bar.</v>

278
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.850
<v Speaker 3>And she went up to get two of you</v>
<v Speaker 3>drinks.</v>

279
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:36.130
<v Speaker 3>And now there's three dudes that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm not leave you alone and you</v>

280
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:39.310
<v Speaker 3>like can't get back to your normal life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

281
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:40.820
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it'd be helping a sister</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

282
00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>

283
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 3>that's what you'd be doing.</v>

284
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't think people who live in cities</v>
<v Speaker 5>have any idea of how many deer there are</v>

285
00:13:46.981 --> 00:13:49.620
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they went through Iowa,</v>

286
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.200
<v Speaker 5>like people went through your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your area,</v>

287
00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.750
<v Speaker 5>they would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

288
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.810
<v Speaker 5>It's like every,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every mile or so.</v>

289
00:13:57.811 --> 00:13:59.580
<v Speaker 5>You're seeing these packs of deer?</v>

290
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many just ones did you see on the</v>

291
00:14:01.501 --> 00:14:03.090
<v Speaker 3>side of the road that people would</v>
<v Speaker 3>struck?</v>

292
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite a few.</v>

293
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.700
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not,</v>

294
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.100
<v Speaker 3>not everyone is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is uh,</v>

295
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.290
<v Speaker 3>lucky enough to just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

296
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.240
<v Speaker 3>hit a deer and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you go to,</v>

297
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.820
<v Speaker 3>you go to the repair shop and they fix</v>
<v Speaker 3>your bumper.</v>

298
00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:17.040
<v Speaker 3>Did I ever tell you about my dad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

299
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:22.120
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad spent many years going through</v>

300
00:14:22.891 --> 00:14:25.530
<v Speaker 3>orthodontics cause he always wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect teeth,</v>

301
00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:29.340
<v Speaker 3>but he never had like the right type of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you did tell me this never had the</v>

302
00:14:29.341 --> 00:14:31.830
<v Speaker 3>right type of like insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And stuff to do it.</v>

303
00:14:31.831 --> 00:14:35.730
<v Speaker 3>So finally we get later in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in his right,</v>

304
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.970
<v Speaker 3>I think he went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started braces when he was like 35 and</v>

305
00:14:38.971 --> 00:14:41.910
<v Speaker 3>he finished it like 40.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wore the retainer for two years,</v>

306
00:14:41.911 --> 00:14:44.820
<v Speaker 3>like everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know,</v>

307
00:14:44.821 --> 00:14:49.821
<v Speaker 3>he's driving down the road and he had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honda civic driving down the road.</v>

308
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.720
<v Speaker 3>A buck runs out in front of the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hits it,</v>

309
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.670
<v Speaker 3>the body of the deer comes through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>windshield into the passenger seat.</v>

310
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.330
<v Speaker 3>The horns came in and hit him right in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the teeth.</v>

311
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.230
<v Speaker 3>So he's got like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's too,</v>

312
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.050
<v Speaker 3>every now and then he'll snag in front</v>
<v Speaker 3>of me and pull,</v>

313
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.360
<v Speaker 3>pull the ones out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

314
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:12.680
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

315
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 3>it was the worst thing because all he</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever wanted was perfect teeth.</v>

316
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:18.740
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as he had them right there in</v>

317
00:15:18.741 --> 00:15:22.160
<v Speaker 3>his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this crazy buck decides to commit</v>

318
00:15:22.161 --> 00:15:24.620
<v Speaker 3>suicide and jumped through the window of</v>
<v Speaker 3>his Honda.</v>

319
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.780
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

320
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.740
<v Speaker 3>that's what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget the numbers I was working on,</v>

321
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a book to try to,</v>

322
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:37.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>introduce some people in Europe to bow</v>

323
00:15:37.131 --> 00:15:38.360
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

324
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.120
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't trying to get it necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>legalized.</v>

325
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.120
<v Speaker 3>I was just trying to give information on</v>
<v Speaker 3>why hunting in the u s is something that</v>

326
00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:52.640
<v Speaker 3>people at least need to keep an open</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind to and why it's necessary.</v>

327
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.370
<v Speaker 3>And I was trying to write a book and</v>
<v Speaker 3>granted,</v>

328
00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for those of you who are listening who</v>

329
00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:00.740
<v Speaker 3>aren't familiar with Joe and I release</v>
<v Speaker 3>our relationship,</v>

330
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shot competitively for a long time a</v>

331
00:16:03.741 --> 00:16:07.250
<v Speaker 3>shot with the u s archery team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a lot,</v>

332
00:16:07.251 --> 00:16:12.251
<v Speaker 3>a lot of miles throughout all of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of my friends were really</v>

333
00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:15.260
<v Speaker 3>sensitive to the fact that I was also a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunter.</v>

334
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.090
<v Speaker 3>And then obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

335
00:16:17.091 --> 00:16:20.990
<v Speaker 3>I met my wife on a plane to France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her all of our family,</v>

336
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.970
<v Speaker 3>there's obviously from Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a subject to where I've tried</v>

337
00:16:25.971 --> 00:16:27.070
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

338
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:32.060
<v Speaker 3>explain it the way that I'm explaining</v>
<v Speaker 3>this now and you know there's,</v>

339
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.480
<v Speaker 3>there's such a difference between areas</v>
<v Speaker 3>that really need that as part of,</v>

340
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is population control.</v>

341
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.510
<v Speaker 3>Look at how many we were gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were probably hunting what,</v>

342
00:16:44.511 --> 00:16:49.511
<v Speaker 3>16 full hours and how many hogs do you</v>
<v Speaker 3>think we saw including the little ones,</v>

343
00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:52.250
<v Speaker 3>which will all be breeding within six</v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

344
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:55.670
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every baby we saw right now can be</v>

345
00:16:55.671 --> 00:16:57.830
<v Speaker 3>breeding in six months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>

346
00:16:57.831 --> 00:16:58.664
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six months.</v>

347
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.830
<v Speaker 3>So I mean you think you'd do it twice a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>

348
00:17:00.831 --> 00:17:03.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we saw at least that will,</v>

349
00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:06.740
<v Speaker 3>that we saw that one sow that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>stocked on.</v>

350
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:11.770
<v Speaker 3>She had maybe eight right little guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when we went out at dark that</v>

351
00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:13.400
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many ton of,</v>

352
00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:18.401
<v Speaker 3>oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just say we saw 30 total at least.</v>

353
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.540
<v Speaker 3>So within 60 days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of those six months,</v>

354
00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:26.870
<v Speaker 3>any of those females will be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>breed and then they're having six to</v>

355
00:17:26.871 --> 00:17:28.490
<v Speaker 3>eight to 10 again,</v>

356
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.990
<v Speaker 5>animal man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a weird animal.</v>

357
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:33.980
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't seem like it belongs there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really strange like because,</v>

358
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.760
<v Speaker 5>because it's an invasive species,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see how it's unbalanced.</v>

359
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.690
<v Speaker 5>They just make babies and go and make</v>
<v Speaker 5>babies and go and you've got a Whoa,</v>

360
00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:44.090
<v Speaker 5>they got to like the [inaudible] ranch</v>
<v Speaker 5>keeps a wrap on it.</v>

361
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.440
<v Speaker 5>But some places where they get away from</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a ranch environment,</v>

362
00:17:48.441 --> 00:17:49.530
<v Speaker 5>which is kind of ironic</v>

363
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.160
<v Speaker 4>because like in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some places like San Jose,</v>

364
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:55.980
<v Speaker 4>which have never had a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 4>wildlife at all,</v>

365
00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:00.000
<v Speaker 4>other than the occasional deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're getting wild pigs and once they</v>

366
00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:00.751
<v Speaker 4>get in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

367
00:18:00.751 --> 00:18:03.660
<v Speaker 4>whew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got giant fucking</v>

368
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.510
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're,</v>

369
00:18:06.511 --> 00:18:09.720
<v Speaker 4>it's a totally different kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like a squirrel to his big ass</v>

370
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.400
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's running around eating people's</v>

371
00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:12.211
<v Speaker 4>yards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

372
00:18:12.211 --> 00:18:15.870
<v Speaker 4>when they were brought here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people had them on their farm to have a</v>

373
00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:19.950
<v Speaker 4>continual replenishment of food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like they were growing them to</v>

374
00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:22.050
<v Speaker 4>say we want to have this massive pig</v>
<v Speaker 4>farm.</v>

375
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.520
<v Speaker 4>They were growing them is that pigs were</v>
<v Speaker 4>great because you could eat on them</v>

376
00:18:26.521 --> 00:18:29.460
<v Speaker 4>continually throughout the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>throughout the whole year.</v>

377
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:31.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they continually reproduce.</v>

378
00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:35.910
<v Speaker 4>But once they go out into the wild and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there isn't a family that's utilizing</v>

379
00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:36.540
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

380
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.060
<v Speaker 4>small batch of hogs or chickens or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>

381
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.590
<v Speaker 4>then they just go crazy.</v>

382
00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really crazy.</v>

383
00:18:42.631 --> 00:18:43.111
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a,</v>

384
00:18:43.111 --> 00:18:48.111
<v Speaker 4>what a bizarre animal to invade into an</v>
<v Speaker 4>ecosystem pig.</v>

385
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:51.900
<v Speaker 4>They're just so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we,</v>

386
00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:55.410
<v Speaker 4>we look at them in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He know they have like that bad</v>

387
00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:58.110
<v Speaker 4>reputation because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

388
00:18:58.111 --> 00:19:00.090
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when when someone calls someone a pig,</v>

389
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.610
<v Speaker 4>like if you call person a pig,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like one of the worst things you</v>

390
00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:05.850
<v Speaker 4>can say to a person out of it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

391
00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:07.820
<v Speaker 4>if you call someone a monkey dussel's</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

392
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm the fucking dumb monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's me.</v>

393
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.570
<v Speaker 4>I'd say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

394
00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:15.300
<v Speaker 4>if you called some someone at Gazelle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd be psyched.</v>

395
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.160
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

396
00:19:17.161 --> 00:19:19.140
<v Speaker 4>you are a gazelle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd be like,</v>

397
00:19:19.141 --> 00:19:19.860
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think?</v>

398
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.281
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

399
00:19:20.281 --> 00:19:22.500
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're an animal that gets jacked by</v>

400
00:19:22.501 --> 00:19:24.120
<v Speaker 4>lions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could I be,</v>

401
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.520
<v Speaker 4>what's my animal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to Avatar.</v>

402
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:29.850
<v Speaker 4>What's my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd probably be some sort of primates</v>

403
00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:32.550
<v Speaker 4>from a large primate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like maybe an orangutan.</v>

404
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.290
<v Speaker 4>Something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

405
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.740
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was the stupid movie where I'm</v>

406
00:19:37.741 --> 00:19:39.450
<v Speaker 4>overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They kind of just sit there.</v>

407
00:19:39.451 --> 00:19:41.640
<v Speaker 4>It's one of my favorite kettle bells</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Orangutang.</v>

408
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that guy.</v>

409
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.530
<v Speaker 4>He's got to get it really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

410
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.640
<v Speaker 4>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like it'll all the primates.</v>

411
00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:49.260
<v Speaker 4>That's the one that would fuck with you</v>
<v Speaker 4>the least.</v>

412
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:50.700
<v Speaker 4>Be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's up dude?</v>

413
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.680
<v Speaker 4>How you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess if I was the big guy that was</v>

414
00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:56.340
<v Speaker 4>actually just kinda soft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which one would freak out the most of</v>

415
00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:58.410
<v Speaker 4>primates?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

416
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.650
<v Speaker 4>I was going to give you a silver back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now that you say that,</v>

417
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.460
<v Speaker 4>I would say if I had to fear one thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the primates,</v>

418
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be like a freaking,</v>

419
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.010
<v Speaker 4>if baboons are bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they could be pretty.</v>

420
00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:15.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean if a Babin brain and temperament</v>
<v Speaker 4>was in a silver back</v>

421
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.230
<v Speaker 4>would be a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

422
00:20:19.231 --> 00:20:23.400
<v Speaker 4>we had this discussion if like some of</v>
<v Speaker 4>these animals that are just,</v>

423
00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.430
<v Speaker 4>this is what's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People think we don't like animals</v>

424
00:20:26.431 --> 00:20:28.500
<v Speaker 4>because we shoot him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We actually appreciate him more.</v>

425
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.030
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really think about,</v>

426
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.260
<v Speaker 4>I have so much respect for grizzlies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

427
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:37.380
<v Speaker 4>in brown bears and then I see something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a silver back and the strength of</v>

428
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:40.030
<v Speaker 4>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think if,</v>

429
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:44.580
<v Speaker 4>if this was a society where everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>like fought for its turf and those two</v>

430
00:20:44.581 --> 00:20:45.990
<v Speaker 4>met,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

431
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

432
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.260
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

433
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.850
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting is I think he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

434
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.470
<v Speaker 1>there used to be bigger and bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals than them.</v>

435
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking died off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

436
00:20:55.361 --> 00:20:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Well we can relate to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dinosaur thing would've been,</v>

437
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.840
<v Speaker 1>that would've been so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you could short face bear?</v>

438
00:21:01.841 --> 00:21:03.150
<v Speaker 1>You ever hear about that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

439
00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.010
<v Speaker 1>I have machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That short face bear was enormous.</v>

440
00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Bear that lived in North America has</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently was fucking huge.</v>

441
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Bigger than a polar bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferocious Predator,</v>

442
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.250
<v Speaker 1>died out somewhere around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they think 10,000 plus years</v>

443
00:21:15.251 --> 00:21:17.440
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it ain't shit.</v>

444
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.131
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

445
00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:19.780
<v Speaker 1>that's not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I right about that?</v>

446
00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Or is it a hundred thousand years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might be a hundred thousand years.</v>

447
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.270
<v Speaker 1>How big will find out when that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

448
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 1>it was enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enormous bear.</v>

449
00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.580
<v Speaker 1>But did they know it was the face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

450
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the bones.</v>

451
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the skull.</v>

452
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:33.820
<v Speaker 1>It had a totally different face.</v>

453
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.300
<v Speaker 1>That's the size of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that amazing?</v>

454
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.540
<v Speaker 1>So would they not know that was a polar</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear?</v>

455
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short face bear has a different skull.</v>

456
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.610
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like right up</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

457
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:48.610
<v Speaker 1>But it was bigger than a polar bear is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the biggest bear ever by far.</v>

458
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.700
<v Speaker 1>They were fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's my point.</v>

459
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit can just keep getting bigger and</v>

460
00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:54.910
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It competes.</v>

461
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.400
<v Speaker 1>And then look at people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are bigger now than they've ever</v>

462
00:21:57.401 --> 00:21:58.550
<v Speaker 1>been before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thriller.</v>

463
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Throw a line main on that sucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do have something that,</v>

464
00:22:02.111 --> 00:22:03.670
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That looks like the Predator.</v>

465
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Look at the face on that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an enormous,</v>

466
00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.370
<v Speaker 1>super bare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right out of the Avatar.</v>

467
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea was it's a bad wolf.</v>

468
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Did they have like a wolf?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't heard of her wolves,</v>

469
00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.190
<v Speaker 1>weren't they the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing,</v>

470
00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:19.330
<v Speaker 1>that short face bear.</v>

471
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this guy named Dan Flores and he</v>

472
00:22:22.481 --> 00:22:24.920
<v Speaker 1>believes that that short face bear and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible],</v>

473
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.960
<v Speaker 1>apparently a bunch of other people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>studied the migration of people into</v>

474
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.270
<v Speaker 1>North America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they believe that Short,</v>

475
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:34.750
<v Speaker 1>that short face bear might have been one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the barriers and it was so ferocious</v>

476
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.790
<v Speaker 1>and so fierce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you love matching?</v>

477
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:42.030
<v Speaker 1>If you were a dude and his family and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're walking from Asia to the United</v>

478
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:48.160
<v Speaker 1>States and you see one of those mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucker of motherfucker bears,</v>

479
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.760
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck am I doing here?</v>

480
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.340
<v Speaker 1>An enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're saying for the,</v>

481
00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.460
<v Speaker 1>for the border,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we need everywhere.</v>

482
00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Cages for Kiki kicked ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guard.</v>

483
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:03.850
<v Speaker 1>The board is with giant Wolf dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>

484
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:06.460
<v Speaker 1>That thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much bigger than a polar boy</v>

485
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.530
<v Speaker 1>vampire or Werewolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always an underworld was a good</v>

486
00:23:11.531 --> 00:23:12.290
<v Speaker 1>call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vampires,</v>

487
00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:13.180
<v Speaker 1>vampires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>24,</v>

488
00:23:13.181 --> 00:23:16.360
<v Speaker 1>seven c Werewolf's have to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>Werewolf's and then they have to go</v>

489
00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:17.140
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

490
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Leaves you vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many jacks you when you're not aware</v>

491
00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:22.810
<v Speaker 1>of wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're a bully for a couple of</v>

492
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.240
<v Speaker 1>nights out of the month and the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the month your pussy.</v>

493
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

494
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what the Werewolf</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

495
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:32.870
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a werewolf.</v>

496
00:23:32.871 --> 00:23:35.590
<v Speaker 1>It would be a really weird one if it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>real humanity.</v>

497
00:23:35.591 --> 00:23:38.500
<v Speaker 1>If we had to like find out who the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Werewolf's swear and you have to make an</v>

498
00:23:38.501 --> 00:23:41.710
<v Speaker 1>ethical choice to kill him when he was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person or do you uh,</v>

499
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.290
<v Speaker 1>do you lock them up for a couple of days</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year cause it's done.</v>

500
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:45.800
<v Speaker 1>It's fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

501
00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:46.310
<v Speaker 1>A vampire</v>

502
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.550
<v Speaker 4>would be pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess they say that mathematically</v>

503
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:51.410
<v Speaker 4>it's not impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not possible.</v>

504
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.050
<v Speaker 4>If Vampire's couldn't exist cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>there'd be no people left,</v>

505
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.810
<v Speaker 4>but there's certain amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 4>there'd be no people.</v>

506
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.560
<v Speaker 4>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a very logical way to put it.</v>

507
00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:01.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes a ton of sense because you</v>

508
00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:04.280
<v Speaker 4>would infect someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see you and I would like someone else.</v>

509
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.200
<v Speaker 4>You and I would like it because the</v>
<v Speaker 4>older we get,</v>

510
00:24:06.201 --> 00:24:10.340
<v Speaker 4>the more we really realize what makes us</v>
<v Speaker 4>happy and what we like to do.</v>

511
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:14.630
<v Speaker 4>So imagine if right now you knew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

512
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 50 but who cares?</v>

513
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.030
<v Speaker 4>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know exactly what I want to do.</v>

514
00:24:20.031 --> 00:24:25.031
<v Speaker 4>We could all be like a thousand and Jay</v>
<v Speaker 4>are still happening because you're just</v>

515
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:27.740
<v Speaker 4>endless now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

516
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:31.910
<v Speaker 4>I definitely don't know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lost you somewhere in the middle of</v>

517
00:24:31.911 --> 00:24:32.744
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

518
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.640
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were just saying mathematically for</v>

519
00:24:34.641 --> 00:24:38.600
<v Speaker 4>years and they live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying if for you and I we</v>

520
00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:41.570
<v Speaker 4>enjoy our life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For some people that I know that don't</v>

521
00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:43.520
<v Speaker 4>enjoy their life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be a nightmare.</v>

522
00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.670
<v Speaker 4>The fact that they had to keep going and</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep going,</v>

523
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:50.450
<v Speaker 4>that'd be pretty pumped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the thing about vampires,</v>

524
00:24:50.451 --> 00:24:53.750
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't work as mathematically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're a vampire and you by Jamie,</v>

525
00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:57.850
<v Speaker 4>Jamie becomes a van par and he bites</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody else and you have to buy it</v>

526
00:24:57.851 --> 00:25:00.530
<v Speaker 4>like a person a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas the Werewolf,</v>

527
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.840
<v Speaker 4>it's only a couple of nights a week</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you're an asshole.</v>

528
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.240
<v Speaker 4>Like if there was like a cage and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

529
00:25:05.241 --> 00:25:06.860
<v Speaker 4>I feel it coming on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

530
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:07.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if a woman was like,</v>

531
00:25:07.911 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know my period is coming,</v>

532
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.630
<v Speaker 4>the guy would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're getting really close to the full</v>

533
00:25:11.631 --> 00:25:13.100
<v Speaker 4>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go check myself.</v>

534
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:17.330
<v Speaker 4>Then he checked yourself in one of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>big ass steel cages and then you turn</v>

535
00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:19.910
<v Speaker 4>into a werewolf or a couple of days he</v>
<v Speaker 4>chill out.</v>

536
00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.770
<v Speaker 4>You could maybe if you don't like if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

537
00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:26.210
<v Speaker 4>you locked up in a cage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it was like fasting and then when</v>

538
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:29.240
<v Speaker 4>you're fasting your body sort of starts</v>
<v Speaker 4>burning fat.</v>

539
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.610
<v Speaker 4>You lose your appetite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you calm everything down.</v>

540
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.280
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's what it's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing with werewolves,</v>

541
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.260
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not to change subject.</v>

542
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.240
<v Speaker 4>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can talk wearables more.</v>

543
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.610
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull up the Irish elk,</v>

544
00:25:40.611 --> 00:25:42.890
<v Speaker 4>Jamie that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember when I told you about that</v>

545
00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:44.450
<v Speaker 4>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That thing's cool too.</v>

546
00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.560
<v Speaker 4>I wish that was back would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy looking at,</v>

547
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean the short face bear fuck that</v>
<v Speaker 4>short fixed.</v>

548
00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:52.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but things scares the shit out of me</v>

549
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.240
<v Speaker 4>that thinks scares the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people understand how big</v>

550
00:25:56.241 --> 00:25:56.930
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

551
00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:01.220
<v Speaker 4>It's so much bigger than a polar bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's essentially a real monster,</v>

552
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:03.950
<v Speaker 4>a real live monster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was most likely,</v>

553
00:26:03.951 --> 00:26:07.830
<v Speaker 4>ferociously carnivorous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you if that is,</v>

554
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:11.540
<v Speaker 4>if that thing was still alive right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now out in random parts of the</v>

555
00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:14.300
<v Speaker 4>wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you hunt or the Irish shock if it</v>

556
00:26:14.301 --> 00:26:17.060
<v Speaker 4>was viable population?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talking about the short face bear.</v>

557
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.550
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be in the book.</v>

558
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:22.460
<v Speaker 4>We've talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you man.</v>

559
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.980
<v Speaker 4>I have a hard enough time with wild</v>
<v Speaker 4>pigs,</v>

560
00:26:24.981 --> 00:26:26.000
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm freaking out.</v>

561
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.520
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Working out?</v>

562
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.710
<v Speaker 4>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just thinking if I was,</v>

563
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.990
<v Speaker 4>if I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys,</v>

564
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.930
<v Speaker 4>you went through the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I was a kid and I went through the</v>

565
00:26:35.931 --> 00:26:39.230
<v Speaker 4>woods with my buddies and we accounted a</v>
<v Speaker 4>short face bear and eight,</v>

566
00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:41.420
<v Speaker 4>one of my friends just right in front of</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

567
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 4>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a monster.</v>

568
00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

569
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.560
<v Speaker 1>well it would be for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>

570
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.920
<v Speaker 1>I know that when you and I talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii,</v>

571
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I said I would love to learn to surf</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Shane Dorian.</v>

572
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:56.820
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surfing because of the sharks.</v>

573
00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:58.920
<v Speaker 1>So monster soup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same.</v>

574
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.430
<v Speaker 1>It is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can go fuck themselves.</v>

575
00:27:02.431 --> 00:27:06.060
<v Speaker 1>So people are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you people so you wouldn't hunt if</v>

576
00:27:06.061 --> 00:27:10.260
<v Speaker 1>they're short faced bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm bound freaking out by pigs,</v>

577
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:12.540
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How close we got to those pigs.</v>

578
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Some rogue experience follower that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic specialist is probably going to</v>

579
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.100
<v Speaker 1>construct one of those suckers just so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't hunt anymore.</v>

580
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it'll work that way if</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

581
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.010
<v Speaker 1>they're really wasting their energy if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put it towards that.</v>

582
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.130
<v Speaker 1>There's certain animals though that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to freak you out.</v>

583
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.200
<v Speaker 1>You have to respect them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

584
00:27:31.201 --> 00:27:34.470
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about all the different</v>
<v Speaker 1>encounters that people have had where</v>

585
00:27:34.471 --> 00:27:36.300
<v Speaker 1>they were bluff charged by grizzlies.</v>

586
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about that this weekend.</v>

587
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Steve Rinella,</v>

588
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.620
<v Speaker 1>my good friend and the host of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing podcast,</v>

589
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:47.030
<v Speaker 1>meat eater and television show meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>eater was uh,</v>

590
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.970
<v Speaker 1>they were on this hunt and they got</v>
<v Speaker 1>charged by these grizzlies.</v>

591
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:56.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a mama bear and her cubs and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>full on charge and this thing is big.</v>

592
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how big is a 400,</v>

593
00:28:00.361 --> 00:28:02.850
<v Speaker 1>500 pounds and they're bigger than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big was shit?</v>

594
00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Was it a brown bear or a grizzly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly in like math,</v>

595
00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Finland?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

596
00:28:10.081 --> 00:28:12.450
<v Speaker 1>It could have been 600 maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it was.</v>

597
00:28:12.451 --> 00:28:15.510
<v Speaker 1>It was so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so big and it was covering ground</v>

598
00:28:15.511 --> 00:28:16.810
<v Speaker 1>so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

599
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Like when you see them Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you realize how big they are and how</v>

600
00:28:19.381 --> 00:28:21.450
<v Speaker 1>fast they move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know like you know how fast they are</v>

601
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.590
<v Speaker 1>from like zero to their top speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're are almost equal to a dirt bike.</v>

602
00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.690
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they can run 40.</v>

603
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can go like their torque ratio is</v>

604
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.300
<v Speaker 1>very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're running,</v>

605
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.630
<v Speaker 1>they're going to catch you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

606
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I think if one was within 20 yards and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then started like with full intent to</v>

607
00:28:47.581 --> 00:28:50.880
<v Speaker 1>come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you would think about turning</v>

608
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:55.970
<v Speaker 1>and he would get maybe two strides and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing that thing's giving you the</v>

609
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo Dicaprio to the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

610
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:01.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look up that.</v>

611
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.890
<v Speaker 1>What is the speed of those things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Know Adam Green tree,</v>

612
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.470
<v Speaker 1>he encountered one when he was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana.</v>

613
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.770
<v Speaker 1>He had shot an elk and he was packing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elk out by himself.</v>

614
00:29:10.771 --> 00:29:12.690
<v Speaker 1>He was deep in the back country by</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

615
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

616
00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 12 plus miles in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

617
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

618
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.920
<v Speaker 1>She cuts off Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam's an animal and so he goes in</v>

619
00:29:19.921 --> 00:29:21.720
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he shoots his elk.</v>

620
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.750
<v Speaker 1>That was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 Oh,</v>

621
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.100
<v Speaker 1>it's even faster.</v>

622
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:31.590
<v Speaker 1>What's like speed of the speeding on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>residential street?</v>

623
00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't go through a school zone on</v>

624
00:29:33.561 --> 00:29:38.561
<v Speaker 1>the grizzly go zero to 45 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Adam's packing his grizzly,</v>

625
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.250
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>packing this elk out that he shot by</v>

626
00:29:42.251 --> 00:29:43.380

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

627
00:29:43.381 --> 00:29:46.810
<v Speaker 1>he went in there with an archery tag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was a,</v>

628
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:50.110
<v Speaker 1>it was an an an over the counter unit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes in like 12,</v>

629
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.570
<v Speaker 1>12 miles into public land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>

630
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Public hacked it out himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which if you know the numbers,</v>

631
00:29:57.101 --> 00:30:00.790
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be somewhere in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood of 500 pounds of meat.</v>

632
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

633
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:06.370
<v Speaker 1>depending on the fee or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had that other,</v>

634
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:09.270
<v Speaker 1>his friend of his at works for a trophy</v>
<v Speaker 1>taker,</v>

635
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.031
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

636
00:30:10.031 --> 00:30:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Grant Grant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he helped him carry it out after a</v>

637
00:30:13.551 --> 00:30:17.020
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually I had just left Montana.</v>

638
00:30:17.021 --> 00:30:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I went to Montana and hunted eastern</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana for me these,</v>

639
00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.820
<v Speaker 1>but for my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for my elk tag,</v>

640
00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.290
<v Speaker 1>it was only in a general unit.</v>

641
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:28.290
<v Speaker 1>So I had to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally left Montana and drove home,</v>

642
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see Sharon for two days to then drive</v>

643
00:30:31.361 --> 00:30:32.920
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I was driving home,</v>

644
00:30:32.921 --> 00:30:37.150

<v Speaker 1>of impact in that sucker.</v>

645
00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:41.050

649
00:30:50.591 --> 00:30:52.960
<v Speaker 1>do that for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a cool thing too.</v>

650
00:30:52.961 --> 00:30:54.730
<v Speaker 1>People would love to go meet Adam Green</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tree.</v>

652
00:30:56.351 --> 00:31:00.610
<v Speaker 1>That's the one of the cool things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting is how many like really</v>

653
00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:03.160
<v Speaker 1>considerate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really friendly,</v>

654
00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:06.880
<v Speaker 1>helpful people we met on this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah we did.</v>

655
00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.240
<v Speaker 1>We were there and and guide had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>membership out there and had his camper.</v>

656
00:31:10.241 --> 00:31:13.480
<v Speaker 1>They're totally kept to himself and on</v>
<v Speaker 1>his last day when he was coming out,</v>

657
00:31:13.481 --> 00:31:15.430
<v Speaker 1>he saw us and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey dudes,</v>

658
00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I've been on this really cool big red</v>
<v Speaker 1>boar that I saw and you know,</v>

659
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.470
<v Speaker 1>literally told us like go up here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn here,</v>

660
00:31:23.471 --> 00:31:24.220
<v Speaker 1>go here.</v>

661
00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.340
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been able to get on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guy was like genuinely</v>

662
00:31:27.341 --> 00:31:32.341
<v Speaker 1>helpful to another hunter and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that 100% is what we need.</v>

663
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Society really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need everyone to just like help one</v>

664
00:31:35.921 --> 00:31:38.980
<v Speaker 1>another out when it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're going to have pettiness in</v>

665
00:31:38.981 --> 00:31:43.030
<v Speaker 1>every single group of humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think overall the tone that I've</v>

666
00:31:43.031 --> 00:31:45.160
<v Speaker 1>experienced from people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in hunting,</v>

667
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.590
<v Speaker 1>very helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very respectful,</v>

668
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:51.160
<v Speaker 1>sounds crazy to those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that they have,</v>

669
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:55.570
<v Speaker 1>by being in nature and experiencing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and death moments in nature,</v>

670
00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I think what it addresses a certain part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them in their place,</v>

671
00:32:00.611 --> 00:32:05.320
<v Speaker 1>in the food chain that almost like comms</v>
<v Speaker 1>and internal aspect of people that are</v>

672
00:32:05.321 --> 00:32:08.470
<v Speaker 1>involved in it because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real struggle,</v>

673
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:13.420
<v Speaker 1>the life and death struggle of consuming</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat is undeniable.</v>

674
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of like what it means,</v>

675
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.680
<v Speaker 1>like this is what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals to die,</v>

676
00:32:17.681 --> 00:32:18.320
<v Speaker 1>you have to cut it up.</v>

677
00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.153
<v Speaker 1>You Cook it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat it.</v>

678
00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:21.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the PR.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to the restaurant and I</v>

679
00:32:21.521 --> 00:32:22.930
<v Speaker 1>don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

680
00:32:22.931 --> 00:32:24.880
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened that I don't</v>

681
00:32:24.881 --> 00:32:27.460
<v Speaker 1>know what happened is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the hunting.</v>

682
00:32:27.461 --> 00:32:30.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that 95% of the people,</v>

683
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:35.620
<v Speaker 1>95 that's a big number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what percentage of them have ever</v>

684
00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:38.230
<v Speaker 1>even seen it happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What percentage of them have done it</v>

685
00:32:38.231 --> 00:32:39.330
<v Speaker 1>themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What percent?</v>

686
00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to,</v>

687
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.960
<v Speaker 1>you definitely don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

688
00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:42.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just talking.</v>

689
00:32:42.921 --> 00:32:47.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not passing any judgment on people</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that I have in the past.</v>

690
00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this right now.</v>

691
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:51.680
<v Speaker 1>This is one thing I thought about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other day.</v>

692
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:56.270
<v Speaker 1>How many people have gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've ordered something like that and</v>

693
00:32:56.271 --> 00:33:01.130
<v Speaker 1>then they don't eat it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they throw it in the trashcan.</v>

694
00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened.</v>

695
00:33:02.781 --> 00:33:04.430
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but doing what you are.</v>

696
00:33:04.431 --> 00:33:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you look at that differently?</v>

697
00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.580
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you cooked an elk roast,</v>

698
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.770
<v Speaker 1>which I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not even fair that I'm bringing</v>

699
00:33:12.771 --> 00:33:15.470
<v Speaker 1>this up because we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did it the first night I came in,</v>

700
00:33:15.471 --> 00:33:18.590
<v Speaker 1>but if you cooked an elk gross and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't need it all,</v>

701
00:33:18.591 --> 00:33:21.230
<v Speaker 1>would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you dump that into the trash?</v>

702
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

703
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:23.323
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat it.</v>

704
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:27.290
<v Speaker 1>And what else don't eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feed to my chickens and people go</v>

705
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.000
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone said this to me like,</v>

706
00:33:29.001 --> 00:33:30.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that's natural man.</v>

707
00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.060
<v Speaker 1>A chicken eating and elk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

708
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just meet your chicken is a goddamn</v>

709
00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.950
<v Speaker 1>murdered motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to come off it.</v>

710
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Your chicken is more ruthless and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderous than any cat you've ever met.</v>

711
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.500
<v Speaker 1>They are God damn dinosaurs.</v>

712
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't they say velociraptors</v>

713
00:33:47.211 --> 00:33:50.200
<v Speaker 1>technically a dinosaur chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

714
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Some in somehow or another like like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient Australia.</v>

715
00:33:54.111 --> 00:33:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Pithy kiss is a human of today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that,</v>

716
00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.490
<v Speaker 1>that chain of progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

717
00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dinosaur became a chicken.</v>

718
00:34:01.431 --> 00:34:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Some kind of little raptor ma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are fucking ruthless man.</v>

719
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I've met some people that must have</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely been t rex got a couple of</v>

720
00:34:10.011 --> 00:34:13.430
<v Speaker 1>friends where they're so pumped how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more they can bench.</v>

721
00:34:13.431 --> 00:34:16.010
<v Speaker 1>But when they're like doing it about</v>
<v Speaker 1>four inches,</v>

722
00:34:16.011 --> 00:34:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is up dude?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

724
00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.040

<v Speaker 1>People love to do more impressive</v>

725
00:34:22.041 --> 00:34:24.650
<v Speaker 1>numbers incorrectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

726
00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very true.</v>

727
00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:27.710

<v Speaker 1>people hurt more than anything.</v>

728
00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Lifting weights.</v>

737
00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:53.711
<v Speaker 1>fucking Herculean like 300 pound man and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm over there doing a kettlebell</v>

738
00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:58.780
<v Speaker 1>workout with 35 pounds like a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing 35 pound windmills.</v>

739
00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I was doing like these slow moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>kettle bell,</v>

740
00:35:01.951 --> 00:35:05.300
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like look man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this is not the same thing as</v>

741
00:35:05.301 --> 00:35:07.460
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing but you don't do this</v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

742
00:35:07.461 --> 00:35:08.294
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

743
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.630
<v Speaker 1>like doing like slow stuff live with</v>
<v Speaker 1>lightweights.</v>

744
00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Controlled stuff is good for your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

745
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like guys get it in their head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got to be floating on bench and</v>

746
00:35:18.171 --> 00:35:23.000
<v Speaker 1>nine 50 bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you doing this like you can't move,</v>

747
00:35:23.001 --> 00:35:26.000
<v Speaker 1>you got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's got a move that's all about</v>

748
00:35:26.001 --> 00:35:29.540
<v Speaker 1>free range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best thing I did was went down on</v>

749
00:35:29.541 --> 00:35:33.710
<v Speaker 1>your recommendation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I flew down to the onnit academy and met</v>

750
00:35:33.711 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 1>all those guys and spent I think two</v>
<v Speaker 1>days in there and just said I</v>

751
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.980
<v Speaker 3>want to do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Show me the May,</v>

752
00:35:39.981 --> 00:35:41.940
<v Speaker 3>show me kettle bells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

753
00:35:41.941 --> 00:35:44.800
<v Speaker 3>I did some stuff on rings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

754
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.780
<v Speaker 3>did some stuff on Bungee straps and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

755
00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:50.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you see people that have conditions,</v>

756
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.790
<v Speaker 3>they've worked out that way and</v>
<v Speaker 3>something real simple.</v>

757
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.890
<v Speaker 3>And then you have someone that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

758
00:35:55.891 --> 00:35:59.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five to 30 to 20,</v>

759
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.010
<v Speaker 3>probably two 30 after hunting camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

760
00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:06.720
<v Speaker 3>and they're doing these simple movements</v>
<v Speaker 3>to where you just feel like a Wussy.</v>

761
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:11.840
<v Speaker 3>There's people that are that</v>
<v Speaker 3>structurally and core wise or so sound</v>

762
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.860
<v Speaker 3>and actually movable muscle and usable</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle.</v>

763
00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:22.160
<v Speaker 3>It's totally different than only only</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain types of weights that most</v>

764
00:36:22.711 --> 00:36:26.730
<v Speaker 3>people do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I met Frank Zane years ago and I</v>

765
00:36:26.731 --> 00:36:31.680
<v Speaker 3>went and trained with him on my weight</v>
<v Speaker 3>training specifically on freeways,</v>

766
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.680
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I had wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met him when I met,</v>

767
00:36:34.681 --> 00:36:39.450
<v Speaker 3>I think I met him maybe in my late</v>
<v Speaker 3>twenties and at that point I'd been</v>

768
00:36:39.451 --> 00:36:41.310
<v Speaker 3>working out maybe 15 years.</v>

769
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:42.870
<v Speaker 3>And I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

770
00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:48.320
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I've wasted 15 years of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>really trying to improve myself.</v>

771
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:53.570
<v Speaker 3>But I realize now how inefficient I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when I've started to learn some</v>

772
00:36:54.061 --> 00:36:57.030
<v Speaker 3>of these movements that are about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

773
00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:01.950
<v Speaker 3>real body usage strength,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel the same way.</v>

774
00:37:01.951 --> 00:37:05.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm like I wish when I was in high</v>
<v Speaker 3>school my football coach would have been</v>

775
00:37:05.791 --> 00:37:09.210
<v Speaker 3>having people do windmills because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about how,</v>

776
00:37:09.211 --> 00:37:10.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to wrestling practice,</v>

777
00:37:10.651 --> 00:37:13.050
<v Speaker 3>everyone's talking about how important</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is to be solid.</v>

778
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.260
<v Speaker 3>But everything was like bench,</v>
<v Speaker 3>squat,</v>

779
00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:19.440
<v Speaker 3>deadlift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean things like what we just talked</v>

780
00:37:19.441 --> 00:37:21.450
<v Speaker 3>about with like a windmill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's totally different.</v>

781
00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

782
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:22.870
<v Speaker 1>bend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squat,</v>

783
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:26.320
<v Speaker 1>squat deadlift is still the kings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I just think that people get a</v>

784
00:37:26.321 --> 00:37:28.450
<v Speaker 1>little bit kings for total mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

785
00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Just get people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a little caught up in the numbers</v>

786
00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.900
<v Speaker 1>and to the point where they're willing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ignore the form.</v>

787
00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:36.640
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's where a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>get hurt.</v>

788
00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like a real problem with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a little bit too macho.</v>

789
00:37:39.491 --> 00:37:43.770
<v Speaker 1>And I fucking absolutely have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty of that while I was lifting</v>

790
00:37:43.771 --> 00:37:44.740
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much weight.</v>

791
00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I can bro,</v>

792
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.650
<v Speaker 1>cause I could do it bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to Max out on one 35 months.</v>

793
00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.560
<v Speaker 1>One 35 would mean for bench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

794
00:37:53.561 --> 00:37:56.410
<v Speaker 1>like as many times as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to get it once.</v>

795
00:37:56.411 --> 00:37:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh is that a joke?</v>

796
00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I got confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

797
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't joke around with the enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually took me serious.</v>

798
00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I definitely did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be a problem.</v>

799
00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to screw around with anymore.</v>

800
00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.420
<v Speaker 1>I saw brock Lesnar's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever seen his um,</v>

801
00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:11.681
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

802
00:38:11.681 --> 00:38:12.320
<v Speaker 1>you know those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

803
00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.980
<v Speaker 1>the times they do when they're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>out for football?</v>

804
00:38:14.981 --> 00:38:16.600
<v Speaker 1>What's that shit called again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Combine?</v>

805
00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The combine scores.</v>

806
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:21.190
<v Speaker 1>They had brock lesnar versus Shane car</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it was like a big heavyweight fight</v>

807
00:38:21.191 --> 00:38:25.230
<v Speaker 1>cause it was too super powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really dangerous wrestlers in,</v>

808
00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.990
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the combine scores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize what a freak brock lesner</v>

809
00:38:28.991 --> 00:38:31.030
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I saw him ringside with you.</v>

810
00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a freak.</v>

811
00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:36.550
<v Speaker 1>He's a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just straight viking DNA</v>

812
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.980
<v Speaker 5>from the motherland.</v>

813
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.710
<v Speaker 4>If I was a little guy coming from Asia</v>
<v Speaker 4>with my whole family and I had to walk</v>

814
00:38:41.711 --> 00:38:44.620
<v Speaker 4>up to fat dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would think the same thing as a short</v>

815
00:38:44.621 --> 00:38:46.450
<v Speaker 4>faced bears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>

816
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.760
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to go by that.</v>

817
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.760
<v Speaker 4>Then flat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that fucking thing,</v>

818
00:38:51.761 --> 00:38:54.130
<v Speaker 4>brick and traps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to go by that.</v>

819
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.700
<v Speaker 4>Screw that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go back and get some Sushi dudes.</v>

820
00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:02.590
<v Speaker 4>If that thing pulls up in a boat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fucked up right you,</v>

821
00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:04.360
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in the wrong place.</v>

822
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:09.480
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that being in war in a viking</v>
<v Speaker 4>ship comes up like 300 of those suckers</v>

823
00:39:10.451 --> 00:39:12.790
<v Speaker 4>coming off rock lester's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jump off the boat.</v>

824
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.700
<v Speaker 4>Fuck this life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been real.</v>

825
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.630
<v Speaker 4>That'd be ripping my undies off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holding up a white flag real fast.</v>

826
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.160
<v Speaker 5>Kind of what we're talking about though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we're talking about the short face</v>

827
00:39:22.161 --> 00:39:24.680
<v Speaker 5>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's like levels of these</v>

828
00:39:24.681 --> 00:39:27.920
<v Speaker 5>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's levels of all these animals and</v>

829
00:39:27.921 --> 00:39:32.921
<v Speaker 5>they reach a state of balance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the weird things that I</v>

830
00:39:33.111 --> 00:39:36.560
<v Speaker 5>experienced this weekend and I've</v>
<v Speaker 5>experienced before while wild pig</v>

831
00:39:36.561 --> 00:39:39.620
<v Speaker 5>hunting is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like you see something that</v>

832
00:39:39.621 --> 00:39:42.840
<v Speaker 5>other people are not seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you,</v>

833
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:44.630
<v Speaker 5>where you realized you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you a,</v>

834
00:39:44.631 --> 00:39:47.960
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this could be a giant problem.</v>

835
00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:53.020
<v Speaker 5>This can be a giant problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's also like you don't have to go</v>

836
00:39:53.031 --> 00:39:55.910
<v Speaker 5>to the grocery store to get pork.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like in fact,</v>

837
00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:57.560
<v Speaker 5>that's probably not the best way to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

838
00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:02.360
<v Speaker 5>What we really should do is stop doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that and go shoot those legal ones.</v>

839
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:03.231
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

840
00:40:03.231 --> 00:40:05.180
<v Speaker 5>in California we don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no limit.</v>

841
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:07.850
<v Speaker 5>Great Way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have a limit in California.</v>

842
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:08.020
<v Speaker 5>All</v>

843
00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.710
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the hog farmers or like,</v>

844
00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.350
<v Speaker 4>you know</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

845
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:13.281
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

846
00:40:13.281 --> 00:40:14.180
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seriously,</v>

847
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:16.700
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't we do that?</v>

848
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.020
<v Speaker 4>Is there a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there a,</v>

849
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.840
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if we have like a food bank or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something to where,</v>

850
00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we're out for the,</v>

851
00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.830
<v Speaker 4>for the places given food to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>homeless,</v>

852
00:40:24.831 --> 00:40:27.140
<v Speaker 4>why aren't we out doing some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

853
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:31.520
<v Speaker 4>pork lips is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and bringing in some serious pork chops</v>

854
00:40:31.521 --> 00:40:33.920
<v Speaker 4>for people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get Chad out there from whiskey bent</v>

855
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:37.190
<v Speaker 4>barbecue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get him doing some pulled pork butts,</v>

856
00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:39.260
<v Speaker 4>the homeless shelters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'd be ridiculous.</v>

857
00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.570
<v Speaker 4>Trager would sponsor go homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just eat there.</v>

858
00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:43.431
<v Speaker 4>But I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

859
00:40:43.431 --> 00:40:47.030
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think you're allowed to use</v>
<v Speaker 4>wild animals.</v>

860
00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:47.990
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that because,</v>

861
00:40:47.991 --> 00:40:49.460
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it has to do.</v>

862
00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.210
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

863
00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:51.950
<v Speaker 4>you can stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] Iowa.</v>

864
00:40:51.951 --> 00:40:54.260
<v Speaker 4>We have a really good program called</v>
<v Speaker 4>hush.</v>

865
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.531
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

866
00:40:54.531 --> 00:40:55.410
<v Speaker 4>that's not what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need,</v>

867
00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean like a donation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like selling it.</v>

868
00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.790
<v Speaker 4>Like if you wanted to like sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like one of the things about wild game,</v>

869
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:03.460
<v Speaker 4>wild pork,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you can,</v>

870
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.620
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know can commercialize the wires</v>

871
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:09.470
<v Speaker 4>commercial people now doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

872
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:11.870
<v Speaker 4>cause I know when we were in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Indianapolis,</v>

873
00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:16.900
<v Speaker 4>I cooked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cooked elk tacos and the eastern</v>

874
00:41:16.911 --> 00:41:21.500
<v Speaker 4>booth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we had to actually get a license,</v>

875
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:25.790
<v Speaker 4>FDA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>elk farmer to provide the meat I</v>

876
00:41:25.791 --> 00:41:30.620
<v Speaker 4>couldn't bring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that is the disconnect if you raise</v>

877
00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:31.550
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then again,</v>

878
00:41:31.551 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 4>you're like raising a hog in</v>

879
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.360
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same.</v>

880
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:36.021
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it won't be.</v>

881
00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:38.060
<v Speaker 1>What conditions aren't even near the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same?</v>

882
00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the,</v>

883
00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.820
<v Speaker 1>you know what the one guy has got it</v>
<v Speaker 1>down as Joel Salitan diverse here,</v>

884
00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.550
<v Speaker 1>heard of that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a,</v>

885
00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:48.400
<v Speaker 1>of an organization called polyface farms</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

886
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:51.470
<v Speaker 1>had him on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fascinating because he's a real old</v>

887
00:41:51.471 --> 00:41:53.540
<v Speaker 1>school farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really smart.</v>

888
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:57.410
<v Speaker 1>And what he realized somewhere along the</v>
<v Speaker 1>line is that these animals are only</v>

889
00:41:57.411 --> 00:42:01.160
<v Speaker 1>happy when they're living like animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get better product from better</v>

890
00:42:01.161 --> 00:42:02.660
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's healthier.</v>

891
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:07.760
<v Speaker 1>So he takes his pigs and he has his</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling fence so he puts a fence up</v>

892
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:12.230
<v Speaker 1>and he makes it like really big and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fuck everything up on this one side</v>

893
00:42:12.231 --> 00:42:13.970
<v Speaker 1>of the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he moves the fence like having</v>

894
00:42:13.971 --> 00:42:17.270
<v Speaker 1>goats or chickens or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it just an enormous sense,</v>

895
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.490
<v Speaker 1>a good fresh ecosystem?</v>

896
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

897
00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:24.680
<v Speaker 1>And it also recycles all the ground the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground and grow better grass everywhere.</v>

898
00:42:24.681 --> 00:42:26.020
<v Speaker 1>They took a dump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

899
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:30.050
<v Speaker 1>So he does that with chickens too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has this gigantic mobile chicken unit</v>

900
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:33.410
<v Speaker 1>and he pushed this thing around and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>lets you just chickens out and they all</v>

901
00:42:33.411 --> 00:42:35.510
<v Speaker 1>run around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do chicken shit and they go back up</v>

902
00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:37.370
<v Speaker 1>into their little houses when it gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark out,</v>

903
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.310
<v Speaker 1>they know where their houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he moves them around too.</v>

904
00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:42.680
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting,</v>

905
00:42:42.681 --> 00:42:44.900
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this kid,</v>

906
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:48.230
<v Speaker 1>it's less of a disconnect and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were uncomfortable with there</v>

907
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.740
<v Speaker 1>being less of a disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people like to just get a chicken</v>

908
00:42:51.741 --> 00:42:53.450
<v Speaker 1>sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how the fuck you got in</v>

<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does a chicken,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They make great eggs.</v>

917
00:43:11.711 --> 00:43:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line is that's a country</v>

918
00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:17.690
<v Speaker 1>little dinosaur and we're lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing is smaller than us.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We're so weak as humans when we go out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>North American.</v>

925
00:43:31.551 --> 00:43:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Tera Byrd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the one bigger than the Eagle?</v>

926
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:36.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like nine feet tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

927
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Who was a nine foot tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic bird that didn't fly and it</v>

928
00:43:41.901 --> 00:43:44.050
<v Speaker 1>lived in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was an ostrich pull up.</v>

929
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.350
<v Speaker 1>It was an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was predatory.</v>

930
00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:46.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It looks like a nutcracker.</v>

953
00:44:35.371 --> 00:44:37.620

954
00:44:37.621 --> 00:44:38.430
<v Speaker 4>similar.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Faster with less power.</v>

959
00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:47.880
<v Speaker 4>Look at that bird up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's in its mouth?</v>

960
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:51.510
<v Speaker 4>Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 4>riding it.</v>

961
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.800
<v Speaker 4>Joy of Google and he's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>

962
00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:56.950
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

963
00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.770
<v Speaker 4>the park.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would ride that thing.</v>

964
00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.210
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got a real problem with these</v>

965
00:45:00.211 --> 00:45:03.060
<v Speaker 4>genetic engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of these like super geeks out there.</v>

966
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.910
<v Speaker 4>Why don't those are assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>decides to recreate one of these things</v>

967
00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:10.560
<v Speaker 4>and keep it around like William Randolph</v>
<v Speaker 4>hearst the year 2017 if that Dick had</v>

968
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:12.990
<v Speaker 4>just brings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of bringing it around wild hogs,</v>

969
00:45:12.991 --> 00:45:16.560
<v Speaker 4>he brings around terror birds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry of domesticated them.</v>

970
00:45:16.561 --> 00:45:19.380
<v Speaker 4>They're all vegetarian now that I seek</v>
<v Speaker 4>in ride him.</v>

971
00:45:19.381 --> 00:45:20.520
<v Speaker 4>I thought he was pretty cool.</v>

972
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:21.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

973
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:23.520
<v Speaker 4>It says upper class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>

974
00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:28.320
<v Speaker 4>if you pull up to your car spot and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>says like Joe Rogan parking is you ride</v>

975
00:45:28.321 --> 00:45:29.940
<v Speaker 4>up on a t bird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

976
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:31.830
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would anybody who would take your spot</v>

977
00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.120
<v Speaker 4>if they ride up on a bird?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

978
00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.280
<v Speaker 4>what year did that thing go extinct?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The terror bird.</v>

979
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:41.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gotta be prehistoric.</v>

980
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:46.230
<v Speaker 4>We'll definitely create a stork.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>

981
00:45:46.231 --> 00:45:50.790
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the main points of</v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence that I always use when people</v>

982
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:52.710
<v Speaker 4>talk about big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how come you don't,</v>

983
00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.630
<v Speaker 4>I know you don't believe big floods that</v>
<v Speaker 4>really anymore.</v>

984
00:45:54.631 --> 00:45:56.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that I don't believe it's real,</v>

985
00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.920
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a very hard time believing that</v>

986
00:45:58.921 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Speaker 4>hunters haven't seen him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if I'm the reason all these cool</v>

987
00:46:02.221 --> 00:46:04.590
<v Speaker 4>animals are extinct?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cause they walked off the edge of</v>

988
00:46:04.591 --> 00:46:05.424
<v Speaker 4>the earth.</v>

989
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:07.500
<v Speaker 4>That's a good point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

990
00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.720
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they passed the ice wall.</v>

991
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:13.080
<v Speaker 4>There's an ice wall out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can't pass it.</v>

992
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:15.480
<v Speaker 4>Super important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Standing inside the ice wall.</v>

993
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:20.530
<v Speaker 4>There are reports from Uruguay of</v>
<v Speaker 4>finding stating to 450,000 and 17,000</v>

994
00:46:21.751 --> 00:46:26.030
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the claim is debated so immensely.</v>

995
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:28.620
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's as close as we get.</v>

996
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:33.630
<v Speaker 4>62 to 1.8 million years ago is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>actual normal thought of range even</v>

997
00:46:33.811 --> 00:46:37.350
<v Speaker 4>though it doesn't leave it look area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried to keep an open mind about this</v>

998
00:46:37.351 --> 00:46:41.310
<v Speaker 4>flat earth thing and I said try to keep</v>
<v Speaker 4>an open mind.</v>

999
00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:42.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1000
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.970
<v Speaker 4>I kind of wanted to hear the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>side's argument just so I can</v>

1001
00:46:44.971 --> 00:46:47.470
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get what it is,</v>

1002
00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:49.020
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just the lack of</v>

1003
00:46:49.021 --> 00:46:52.140
<v Speaker 4>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what we need is like,</v>

1004
00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.170
<v Speaker 4>and I know Neil degrasse Tyson had this</v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation with Bob,</v>

1005
00:46:55.171 --> 00:46:55.720
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

1006
00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.680
<v Speaker 4>the rapper's name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but kind of explained it to him and Bob</v>

1007
00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:02.160
<v Speaker 4>dissed him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A flat earth support track or some,</v>

1008
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1009
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:06.630
<v Speaker 4>I just think it's just a lack of</v>
<v Speaker 4>communication.</v>

1010
00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:11.670
<v Speaker 4>It's like someone needs to explain to</v>
<v Speaker 4>people in a way that doesn't offend</v>

1011
00:47:11.671 --> 00:47:15.960
<v Speaker 4>their preconceived notions because</v>
<v Speaker 4>people get this idea that they have the</v>

1012
00:47:15.961 --> 00:47:18.450
<v Speaker 4>right information about something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think that something is wrong and</v>

1013
00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:19.140
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1014
00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.480
<v Speaker 4>they get married to that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go,</v>

1015
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:24.930
<v Speaker 4>you'll like Shaq who just recently came</v>
<v Speaker 4>out and said he's married to the idea</v>

1016
00:47:24.931 --> 00:47:26.280
<v Speaker 4>that the world is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like</v>

1017
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 4>how much research you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't</v>

1018
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:30.581
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1019
00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:34.720
<v Speaker 1>are you not pay me how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much research are the people on the</v>

1020
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 1>space station doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they all in on a lie?</v>

1021
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:42.990
<v Speaker 1>They're all in on a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that real or did you decide that</v>

1022
00:47:43.271 --> 00:47:47.710
<v Speaker 1>that's real and now you're looking only</v>
<v Speaker 1>at things that support that idea in your</v>

1023
00:47:47.711 --> 00:47:52.711
<v Speaker 1>head and you're not looking for it</v>
<v Speaker 1>through astrophysicists or astronauts or</v>

1024
00:47:54.401 --> 00:47:57.160
<v Speaker 1>people that study it their whole life</v>
<v Speaker 1>who understand it.</v>

1025
00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.020
<v Speaker 1>You're not looking at it through those</v>
<v Speaker 1>lenses.</v>

1026
00:47:59.021 --> 00:48:03.910
<v Speaker 1>That's why it seems like it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It only seems like it makes sense cause</v>

1027
00:48:03.911 --> 00:48:06.820
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you,</v>

1028
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:11.050
<v Speaker 1>I my Baiting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even focusing on the shack.</v>

1029
00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Think we all are just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all silly.</v>

1030
00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.990
<v Speaker 1>All of us on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even that.</v>

1031
00:48:16.991 --> 00:48:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Just at the people that believe the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth is flat.</v>

1032
00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:22.360
<v Speaker 1>I've got three full passports with</v>
<v Speaker 1>stamps.</v>

1033
00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.570
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel for the people that believe it,</v>

1034
00:48:25.571 --> 00:48:29.230
<v Speaker 1>cause I think some of them didn't tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>them correctly or something.</v>

1035
00:48:29.231 --> 00:48:32.380
<v Speaker 1>But I've never done an international</v>
<v Speaker 1>flight where I flew for a while and then</v>

1036
00:48:32.381 --> 00:48:35.590
<v Speaker 1>the plane banked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turned around.</v>

1037
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.480
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a black hole.</v>

1038
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:39.130
<v Speaker 1>He hit the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ice wall.</v>

1039
00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:42.130
<v Speaker 1>And then you go back in time to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment when you're born is the ice with</v>

1040
00:48:42.131 --> 00:48:44.500
<v Speaker 1>your life over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ice wall real though.</v>

1041
00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's been there and take pictures of</v>

1042
00:48:47.681 --> 00:48:49.600
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't because of the Illuminati</v>

1043
00:48:49.601 --> 00:48:52.720
<v Speaker 1>and plus the Jews know what Pr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just go to the ice wall,</v>

1044
00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:53.560
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

1045
00:48:53.561 --> 00:48:58.561
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking you as a third party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a simple question to joe of</v>

1046
00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:01.960
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens when you get to the</v>

1047
00:49:01.961 --> 00:49:02.680
<v Speaker 1>edge?</v>

1048
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.200
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was an expert and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just make shit up.</v>

1049
00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is there an ice wall or was that,</v>

1050
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.420
<v Speaker 1>it was cause I actually thought that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the argument.</v>

1051
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:10.991
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1052
00:49:10.991 --> 00:49:13.350
<v Speaker 1>that is part of the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

1053
00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:16.030
<v Speaker 1>the part of the argument started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1054
00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:22.380
<v Speaker 1>are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like the Truman show or like</v>

1055
00:49:22.721 --> 00:49:26.740
<v Speaker 1>hunger games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't fault anybody who believes on</v>

1056
00:49:26.741 --> 00:49:28.900
<v Speaker 1>your end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a problem when someone</v>

1057
00:49:28.901 --> 00:49:33.280
<v Speaker 1>believes something and then someone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't believe what they believe.</v>

1058
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:38.400
<v Speaker 1>And then on both sides there's a is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an issue because the side that</v>

1059
00:49:38.411 --> 00:49:41.080
<v Speaker 1>believes that they're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the side of the astronomers and</v>

1060
00:49:41.081 --> 00:49:42.850
<v Speaker 1>astrophysicists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get angry,</v>

1061
00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:47.320
<v Speaker 1>get angry at people that believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>something other than what we are pretty</v>

1062
00:49:47.321 --> 00:49:49.900
<v Speaker 1>sure to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you start making it into personal</v>

1063
00:49:49.901 --> 00:49:51.850
<v Speaker 1>thing and it's stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1064
00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:55.540
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's part of the problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people get invested in their ideas.</v>

1065
00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:57.280
<v Speaker 1>You get invested in the idea of big</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot.</v>

1066
00:49:57.281 --> 00:50:01.870
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking 100% over invested in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of big foot.</v>

1067
00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.300
<v Speaker 1>I was super helpful or hopeful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather every time I would see a new</v>

1068
00:50:05.301 --> 00:50:08.590
<v Speaker 1>story about big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please let this be the one I was</v>

1069
00:50:08.591 --> 00:50:11.680
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like if they really found bigfoot</v>

1070
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would that be fuck yeah.</v>

1071
00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:17.560
<v Speaker 1>But then it did make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't make sense.</v>

1072
00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:19.660
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharon actually brought up a very valid</v>

1073
00:50:19.661 --> 00:50:21.400
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said if there was a big foot,</v>

1074
00:50:21.401 --> 00:50:23.640
<v Speaker 1>it's like what's his age limit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1075
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:25.810
<v Speaker 1>because he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean by now,</v>

1076
00:50:25.811 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 1>that sucker based on like how long</v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys</v>

1077
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:32.420
<v Speaker 4>and stuff live or a bear or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's gone.</v>

1078
00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.810
<v Speaker 4>If there was one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is that there's a population of</v>

1079
00:50:35.811 --> 00:50:39.110
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've talked to several experts.</v>

1080
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:42.920
<v Speaker 4>What's that going to see any updates on</v>
<v Speaker 4>big foot.</v>

1081
00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:44.600
<v Speaker 4>Oh please.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're excellent.</v>

1082
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.920
<v Speaker 4>Rob Lowe and his sons are going to hunt</v>
<v Speaker 4>big foot for Ada.</v>

1083
00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.440
<v Speaker 4>That'll be a fun show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rob Lowe's,</v>

1084
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:53.330
<v Speaker 4>a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hello files.</v>

1085
00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.000
<v Speaker 4>I think that'd be interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but is it,</v>

1086
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.000
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing it like that.</v>

1087
00:50:59.001 --> 00:51:02.990
<v Speaker 4>He really thinks he's going to find it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or is he doing it as a way like,</v>

1088
00:51:02.991 --> 00:51:05.570
<v Speaker 4>okay boys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to prove to you that this is</v>

1089
00:51:05.571 --> 00:51:08.930
<v Speaker 4>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's not even preconceived or</v>

1090
00:51:08.931 --> 00:51:12.440
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's scripted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The little side streets.</v>

1091
00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:13.730
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know who absolutely.</v>

1092
00:51:13.731 --> 00:51:18.731
<v Speaker 4>100% is balls deep in bigfoot bobcat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Goldthwait balls and I love that pot.</v>

1093
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:21.800
<v Speaker 4>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's awesome.</v>

1094
00:51:21.801 --> 00:51:22.910
<v Speaker 4>He was really cool.</v>

1095
00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:26.150
<v Speaker 4>He actually grew leaves actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>believes at that video.</v>

1096
00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:29.210
<v Speaker 4>You know that Patterson footage with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>things walking across the field.</v>

1097
00:51:29.211 --> 00:51:34.211
<v Speaker 4>He thinks of it all the time</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that Bob Patterson guide met you.</v>

1098
00:51:35.361 --> 00:51:36.830
<v Speaker 4>You probably could have taken the place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other guy,</v>

1099
00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:40.550
<v Speaker 4>that muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I had as much hair as you did without</v>

1100
00:51:40.551 --> 00:51:41.350
<v Speaker 4>shaving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1101
00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:45.800
<v Speaker 4>they're in like up here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I could look like that sucker.</v>

1102
00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.380
<v Speaker 4>Like if he seen me stock in that hog</v>
<v Speaker 4>this morning,</v>

1103
00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:52.130
<v Speaker 4>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a fricking big foot doing</v>

1104
00:51:52.131 --> 00:51:53.090
<v Speaker 4>yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1105
00:51:53.091 --> 00:51:57.230
<v Speaker 4>there's some dudes that get real hairy</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we've got to assume that the</v>

1106
00:51:57.350 --> 00:52:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Harriers dude that we know today ain't</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit compared to the Harissa student of</v>

1107
00:52:00.651 --> 00:52:01.670
<v Speaker 4>a hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1108
00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.230
<v Speaker 4>If you didn't have clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1109
00:52:03.231 --> 00:52:05.180
<v Speaker 4>you'd be growing some hair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1110
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:06.450
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>

1111
00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you were cold,</v>

1112
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:12.250
<v Speaker 4>if you had to live or die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would grow hair.</v>

1113
00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:16.340
<v Speaker 4>Why would it be any different than a dog</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sheds when it's hot or grows here</v>

1114
00:52:16.341 --> 00:52:18.170
<v Speaker 4>when it's cold?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because we're not animals.</v>

1115
00:52:18.171 --> 00:52:22.820
<v Speaker 4>John Dudley where people came from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Monkeys don't tell people that they</v>

1116
00:52:22.821 --> 00:52:24.800
<v Speaker 4>don't want to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1117
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:29.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super hairy people and if your kind like</v>

1118
00:52:29.751 --> 00:52:32.840
<v Speaker 4>big giant freak like dudes like you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of covered with hair.</v>

1119
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:34.100
<v Speaker 4>We're so opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>

1120
00:52:34.101 --> 00:52:35.150
<v Speaker 4>You and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1121
00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm like sitting there thinking do what</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be.</v>

1122
00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.580
<v Speaker 4>I feel like a tire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like he's,</v>

1123
00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:41.810
<v Speaker 4>he's my child.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we hug,</v>

1124
00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm his child brother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno,</v>

1125
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:47.180
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember when you told me that story</v>

1126
00:52:47.181 --> 00:52:50.510
<v Speaker 4>about the monkey that you had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you had when you were on fear</v>

1127
00:52:50.511 --> 00:52:52.770
<v Speaker 4>factor chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pete my ass.</v>

1128
00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.270
<v Speaker 4>When you held that little thing you</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought this thing's made a would that,</v>

1129
00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.630
<v Speaker 4>that's what I feel when I get you up on</v>
<v Speaker 4>my shoulder.</v>

1130
00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:01.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>

1131
00:53:01.851 --> 00:53:05.660
<v Speaker 4>this thing's made a would</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely start.</v>

1132
00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:10.340
<v Speaker 4>I was telling Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I've told you this story.</v>

1133
00:53:10.341 --> 00:53:13.520
<v Speaker 4>I've probably told it to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've met that I have a little baby chimp</v>

1134
00:53:13.521 --> 00:53:16.730
<v Speaker 4>on the set of news radio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like way back in the day.</v>

1135
00:53:16.731 --> 00:53:18.350
<v Speaker 4>It was supposed to be in some stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tell you this,</v>

1136
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:21.380
<v Speaker 4>I probably said it before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This little motherfucker was on my back</v>

1137
00:53:21.381 --> 00:53:23.540
<v Speaker 4>and he hit me a couple times and I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>stunned.</v>

1138
00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:25.160
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

1139
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 4>this is not what I thought.</v>

1140
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.260
<v Speaker 1>It was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like a little person</v>

1141
00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:28.741
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1142
00:53:28.741 --> 00:53:30.390
<v Speaker 1>this little person thinks he's a bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>

1143
00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Let me just calm him down now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got on top of the page,</v>

1144
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.940
<v Speaker 1>just hit me a couple times on the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

1145
00:53:35.941 --> 00:53:40.080
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just was thinking it immediately.</v>

1146
00:53:40.081 --> 00:53:43.570
<v Speaker 1>I started doing the math in my head and</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking what it would be like to be</v>

1147
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.960
<v Speaker 1>confronted by a full grown chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1148
00:53:45.961 --> 00:53:48.960
<v Speaker 1>well that's my argument with the silver</v>
<v Speaker 1>back versus grizzly.</v>

1149
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:53.040
<v Speaker 1>You said Grizzly because grizzlies or</v>
<v Speaker 1>even more and more of the fucking bad</v>

1150
00:53:53.041 --> 00:53:55.050
<v Speaker 1>ass than a chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly.</v>

1151
00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly can't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way a chimp can outrun a</v>

1152
00:53:58.801 --> 00:53:59.970
<v Speaker 1>grizzly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way,</v>

1153
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.370
<v Speaker 1>not a chance in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's this?</v>

1154
00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:04.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is a silver back?</v>

1155
00:54:04.681 --> 00:54:07.350

<v Speaker 1>I know it.</v>

1157
00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel confident.</v>

1158
00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:16.370
<v Speaker 1>I think chimps are fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gorillas and I think at Grizzly can</v>

1159
00:54:16.371 --> 00:54:20.640
<v Speaker 1>out run a chimp and I think for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's no way the guerrillas</v>

<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm not like a Grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're a giant dude.</v>

1164
00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:37.530
<v Speaker 1>It</v>
<v Speaker 1>would crumple you like empty pop.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What that means is from someone riding</v>

1177
00:55:12.751 --> 00:55:14.670

<v Speaker 1>That's what an elk is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why the,</v>

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:19.050
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a whopper who called it</v>
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible].</v>

1180
00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:20.400
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does that name come from?</v>

1181
00:55:20.401 --> 00:55:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cool name.</v>

1182
00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:25.680
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Wednesday is the Hashtag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cam uses it a lot.</v>

1183
00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Powerful wapatee Wednesday</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a champ.</v>

1184
00:55:31.381 --> 00:55:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I said a silver back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know what my gap is.</v>

1185
00:55:34.551 --> 00:55:36.840
<v Speaker 1>So do you think a chimp is faster?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jump off there,</v>

1186
00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.700
<v Speaker 1>don't you think in chip is faster than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla?</v>

1187
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:40.080
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] silver back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1188
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen a silver back come out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fricking past</v>

1189
00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:47.930
<v Speaker 1>told you so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1190
00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:49.800
<v Speaker 1>What I'm thinking though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking of restraints,</v>

1191
00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.990
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like an archery argument.</v>

1192
00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:53.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

1193
00:55:53.101 --> 00:55:55.740
<v Speaker 1>I think the bear gets a heavier arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slower speed,</v>

1194
00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:59.040
<v Speaker 1>fast Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's not much of a difference in</v>

1195
00:55:59.041 --> 00:56:02.490
<v Speaker 1>the speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real close and a grizzly bear is so</v>

1196
00:56:02.491 --> 00:56:05.220
<v Speaker 1>much bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moving so much more mass around,</v>

1197
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:09.420
<v Speaker 1>like have a big grizzly is 500 pounds a</v>
<v Speaker 1>silver back.</v>

1198
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a big grizzly interior,</v>

1199
00:56:11.731 --> 00:56:12.900
<v Speaker 1>grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does a big one,</v>

1200
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:16.570
<v Speaker 1>like 900 is that really not a mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly?</v>

1201
00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:18.680
<v Speaker 1>You can look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say aggressive ones.</v>

1202
00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Just say six or 700 and the really big</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that the coastal ones,</v>

1203
00:56:22.321 --> 00:56:23.960
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they call brown bears for</v>

1204
00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:25.750
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do they call them that?</v>

1205
00:56:25.751 --> 00:56:28.120
<v Speaker 4>But because it's the same animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different specie,</v>

1206
00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.950
<v Speaker 4>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1207
00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:31.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't interbreed or anything</v>

1208
00:56:31.751 --> 00:56:33.100
<v Speaker 4>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The break.</v>

1209
00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:34.650
<v Speaker 4>Totally different bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1210
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:39.750
<v Speaker 4>One looks like a Volkswagen with hair</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one looks more like a Ford truck or</v>

1211
00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:44.200
<v Speaker 4>one of those other things where the the</v>
<v Speaker 4>one that has the scare,</v>

1212
00:56:44.201 --> 00:56:47.530
<v Speaker 4>your name is like not the biggest one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is weird.</v>

1213
00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:48.940
<v Speaker 4>Like Brown bear sounded like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1214
00:56:48.941 --> 00:56:52.780
<v Speaker 4>he's so cuddly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you see those buses under brainiac</v>

1215
00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:54.300
<v Speaker 4>island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So coke.</v>

1216
00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:55.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Klondike bars.</v>

1217
00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:57.160
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

1218
00:56:57.250 --> 00:57:00.450
<v Speaker 4>What would you do for a Klondike Bar?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking poor because your buddy,</v>

1219
00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm your buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live in a place where there's no</v>

1220
00:57:02.501 --> 00:57:04.900
<v Speaker 4>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a conspiracy theory.</v>

1221
00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:08.620
<v Speaker 4>Told her bears brought that up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They literally made those to make</v>

1222
00:57:08.621 --> 00:57:11.800
<v Speaker 4>themselves look cuddly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So humans would be stupid enough to walk</v>

1223
00:57:11.801 --> 00:57:12.634
<v Speaker 4>up to him.</v>

1224
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:16.330
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it's like a nature trick?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like nature made them cool to look at?</v>

1225
00:57:16.331 --> 00:57:18.760
<v Speaker 4>So we don't mind as much that they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>murderers.</v>

1226
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:22.180
<v Speaker 4>I would argue Disney fucking Disney,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1227
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:26.980
<v Speaker 4>Like that Bambi movie [inaudible] slower</v>
<v Speaker 4>by 10 miles an hour.</v>

1228
00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:30.430
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there anyone that has the doctor told</v>

1229
00:57:30.431 --> 00:57:30.941
<v Speaker 4>you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1230
00:57:30.941 --> 00:57:35.110
<v Speaker 4>But is there any strength of a silver</v>
<v Speaker 4>back versus a grizzly?</v>

1231
00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:40.390
<v Speaker 4>And I say this saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really respect grizzly bears and brown</v>

1232
00:57:40.391 --> 00:57:44.440
<v Speaker 4>bears cause you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I feel that the concerns of a lot</v>

1233
00:57:44.441 --> 00:57:47.440
<v Speaker 4>of grizzly bears and brown bears that</v>
<v Speaker 4>were listening and they were there,</v>

1234
00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:49.600
<v Speaker 4>they're pumped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that um,</v>

1235
00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:54.070
<v Speaker 4>they're all dangerous and ferocious and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking silver back versus the</v>

1236
00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:56.220
<v Speaker 4>nigger is you think you would win?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1237
00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:59.680
<v Speaker 4>Maybe people who listen to this podcast</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he said put it in the pot and the</v>

1238
00:57:59.681 --> 00:58:02.080
<v Speaker 4>pose what we need to know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what people want to know.</v>

1239
00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:07.350
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't want to fight a 38 pound rat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I be fucking terrified to fight at 38</v>

1240
00:58:09.011 --> 00:58:12.310
<v Speaker 4>pound rat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea of 38 I just can't put a</v>

1241
00:58:12.311 --> 00:58:15.160
<v Speaker 4>number cause that's a fucking giant rat</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1242
00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:17.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he should have said 30 40.</v>

1243
00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.800
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like [inaudible]</v>

1248
00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:30.010

<v Speaker 4>lines.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:18.670
<v Speaker 4>he saw a mountain lion and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he saw a mountain lion when he was</v>

1265
00:59:18.671 --> 00:59:20.710
<v Speaker 4>walking his dogs get these little cutie</v>
<v Speaker 4>dogs.</v>

1266
00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:23.300
<v Speaker 4>He's walking this little cutie dogs and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he saw this fucking thing,</v>

1267
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:27.410
<v Speaker 4>so its tail and picked it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>picked the dogs up and ran back to his</v>

1268
00:59:27.411 --> 00:59:32.411
<v Speaker 4>house and then got on a website,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got on a website and found out that,</v>

1269
00:59:33.171 --> 00:59:33.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1270
00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:36.590
<v Speaker 4>that they attract this animal and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it a,</v>

1271
00:59:36.591 --> 00:59:41.591
<v Speaker 4>it had a collar on it and the tracked it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it got hit by a car on the five and</v>

1272
00:59:41.871 --> 00:59:44.960
<v Speaker 4>he's explaining like how the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing went down.</v>

1273
00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:45.860
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

1274
00:59:45.861 --> 00:59:49.940
<v Speaker 4>like that you were walking your dogs and</v>
<v Speaker 4>this big ass cat,</v>

1275
00:59:49.941 --> 00:59:51.800
<v Speaker 4>it's like 120 pound plus cat.</v>

1276
00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:55.490
<v Speaker 4>So the actual cat that had a collar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knew that's the one he encountered.</v>

1277
00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:56.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1278
00:59:56.090 --> 00:59:58.010
<v Speaker 4>He saw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he saw the collar and then he went on</v>

1279
00:59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.240
<v Speaker 4>the website and you can track because</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd,</v>

1280
01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:04.070
<v Speaker 4>he'd found out that this cat had died</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when he found out the cat died,</v>

1281
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:07.490
<v Speaker 4>he went and uh oh the sound of whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you good?</v>

1282
01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.473
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm good dude.</v>

1283
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:11.000
<v Speaker 4>Trust me you're yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's talking a lot of stupid shit.</v>

1284
01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:13.250
<v Speaker 4>I even touch that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely have.</v>

1285
01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:15.150
<v Speaker 4>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You one of those guys bro.</v>

1286
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:17.540
<v Speaker 4>You ain't even been drunk cause me bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quit bullying me.</v>

1287
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:19.700
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's my instinct.</v>

1288
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.320
<v Speaker 4>What we were just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1289
01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:24.080
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck was I just getting to you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had on the rat.</v>

1290
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:25.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Among other things.</v>

1291
01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:29.390
<v Speaker 4>So a silver back is essentially like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>super,</v>

1292
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:32.270
<v Speaker 4>a super prime it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The most super,</v>

1293
01:00:32.271 --> 01:00:32.870
<v Speaker 4>super prime.</v>

1294
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:37.870
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a bear is one of the most super,</v>

1295
01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:43.250
<v Speaker 4>Super Freak Predator animal freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things like have a bear was little,</v>

1296
01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.700
<v Speaker 4>like a nine pound bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the size of a nine pound rat was</v>

1297
01:00:46.701 --> 01:00:49.310
<v Speaker 4>trying to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd be freaking the fuck out if it was</v>

1298
01:00:49.311 --> 01:00:51.800
<v Speaker 4>running annual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a little tiny bear.</v>

1299
01:00:51.801 --> 01:00:56.390
<v Speaker 4>You'd be fucking terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now think of a giant one and realize how</v>

1300
01:00:56.391 --> 01:00:59.240
<v Speaker 4>pr you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are totally defenseless and I don't</v>

1301
01:00:59.241 --> 01:01:01.010
<v Speaker 4>think it's going to be that much</v>
<v Speaker 4>difference.</v>

1302
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:04.880
<v Speaker 4>For average.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Literally think of a silver back gorilla</v>

1303
01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.340
<v Speaker 4>with the way they're built and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>swing around.</v>

1304
01:01:07.341 --> 01:01:11.570
<v Speaker 4>I think if he stood on the chest of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>grizzly can grab its paws and literally</v>

1305
01:01:11.571 --> 01:01:14.780
<v Speaker 4>rip its arms out and beat it with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1306
01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:17.570
<v Speaker 4>That's King Kong was a good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you there.</v>

1307
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.040
<v Speaker 4>I enjoyed it as much as the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in a Kong,</v>

1308
01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:22.040
<v Speaker 4>but I believe that.</v>

1309
01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:25.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're that strong.</v>

1310
01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:27.890
<v Speaker 4>The thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thumb doves does give an advantage</v>

1311
01:01:27.891 --> 01:01:28.191
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1312
01:01:28.191 --> 01:01:29.610
<v Speaker 4>It could grab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

1313
01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:31.990
<v Speaker 4>it's a little smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Move around a little fast,</v>

1314
01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.330
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm,</v>

1315
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.900
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he just,</v>

1316
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:37.010
<v Speaker 4>the bears way stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Way Stronger.</v>

1317
01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.690
<v Speaker 4>Way Stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could smack at once.</v>

1318
01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:44.300
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen a grown mountain grizzly hit a</v>

1319
01:01:44.991 --> 01:01:46.760
<v Speaker 4>moose and cannon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1320
01:01:46.761 --> 01:01:48.890
<v Speaker 4>You told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I've seen you saw it with your own</v>

1321
01:01:48.891 --> 01:01:49.724
<v Speaker 4>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1322
01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:54.470
<v Speaker 4>Is there any solid information of</v>
<v Speaker 4>strength of a silver back for,</v>

1323
01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:56.500
<v Speaker 4>there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's just a lot of people that have</v>

1324
01:01:56.501 --> 01:01:59.930
<v Speaker 4>argued this on the Internet for the last</v>
<v Speaker 4>five to 10 we get dangerously close to</v>

1325
01:01:59.931 --> 01:02:01.280
<v Speaker 4>this argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>

1326
01:02:01.281 --> 01:02:05.540
<v Speaker 4>Why don't they put thor's hammer on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ground have and like put a,</v>

1327
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:09.770
<v Speaker 4>put a Taco in it or something to where a</v>
<v Speaker 4>grizzly has to try to grab it and pull</v>

1328
01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:13.610
<v Speaker 4>it off and have a sensor versus the</v>
<v Speaker 4>silver back down.</v>

1329
01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.740
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the grizzly definitely can't grab as</v>

1330
01:02:15.741 --> 01:02:17.660
<v Speaker 4>hard because it doesn't have thumbs like</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talked about,</v>

1331
01:02:17.661 --> 01:02:18.560
<v Speaker 4>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1332
01:02:18.561 --> 01:02:21.990
<v Speaker 4>but that's relative to a beating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1333
01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.520
<v Speaker 4>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many fighters have a big ass and a</v>

1334
01:02:26.521 --> 01:02:31.521
<v Speaker 4>lot of like leg power krakoff versus</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone that's just sheer grill up top.</v>

1335
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:34.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's do go there.</v>

1336
01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.860
<v Speaker 4>I just wonder how strong a gorilla</v>
<v Speaker 4>really is in comparison to which</v>

1337
01:02:37.861 --> 01:02:41.820
<v Speaker 4>essentially like a giant dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think he's going to get far</v>

1338
01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:45.090
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think silver back is equivalent to a</v>

1339
01:02:45.091 --> 01:02:47.400
<v Speaker 4>giant dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bearers?</v>

1340
01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:50.840
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A bear is like essentially like a giant</v>

1341
01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.220
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1342
01:02:52.890 --> 01:02:55.700
<v Speaker 4>why would I call it silver back dog?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>

1343
01:02:55.730 --> 01:03:00.060
<v Speaker 4>We've had a couple of adult beverage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1344
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:02.100
<v Speaker 4>and we had a fun time this weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1345
01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:04.850
<v Speaker 4>We'd really fun time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

1346
01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.750
<v Speaker 4>You John Dudley's the greatest archery</v>
<v Speaker 4>coach in the world there.</v>

1347
01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.530
<v Speaker 4>I said it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even though I only have experience</v>

1348
01:03:10.531 --> 01:03:12.930
<v Speaker 4>with John Today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm telling you,</v>

1349
01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:14.700
<v Speaker 4>he knows his shit to the point where I</v>
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>

1350
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:16.930
<v Speaker 4>I highly doubt that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1351
01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.410
<v Speaker 4>does anybody's more detail oriented than</v>
<v Speaker 4>you?</v>

1352
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:21.180
<v Speaker 4>He do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sharon told me that.</v>

1353
01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:25.230
<v Speaker 4>She said a lot of times you'll give a</v>
<v Speaker 4>compliment to me,</v>

1354
01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:29.520
<v Speaker 4>but then you'll immediately say</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that contradicts it.</v>

1355
01:03:29.521 --> 01:03:31.200
<v Speaker 4>Like I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say I say,</v>

1356
01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.470
<v Speaker 4>I really love those shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those shoes look really good.</v>

1357
01:03:34.471 --> 01:03:36.300
<v Speaker 4>And then I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>without knowing it,</v>

1358
01:03:36.301 --> 01:03:39.390
<v Speaker 4>say those silver ones that you have or</v>
<v Speaker 4>better or whatever,</v>

1359
01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:40.290
<v Speaker 4>just say it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1360
01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:42.660
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You kind of did that to me.</v>

1361
01:03:42.661 --> 01:03:43.290
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

1362
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:45.210
<v Speaker 4>I was a good coach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've only had one.</v>

1363
01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:47.880
<v Speaker 4>I know though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're doing though.</v>

1364
01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:50.320
<v Speaker 4>You're so good research though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

1365
01:03:50.321 --> 01:03:51.300
<v Speaker 4>You just show it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1366
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:53.460
<v Speaker 4>you stopped me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Archery is fascinating.</v>

1367
01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:57.000
<v Speaker 4>It's such a fascinating thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am definitely a stalker in a Weirdo,</v>

1368
01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.690
<v Speaker 4>especially when it comes to archery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like learning it and learning from a</v>

1369
01:04:00.691 --> 01:04:05.691
<v Speaker 4>guy who's like such a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way you break the whole thing down</v>

1370
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:08.910
<v Speaker 4>is so fascinating because you expose</v>
<v Speaker 4>these little weaknesses.</v>

1371
01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:10.940
<v Speaker 4>I've seen you do it and he did it this</v>
<v Speaker 4>weekend with uh,</v>

1372
01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:15.000
<v Speaker 4>our friend Steve or this week with Steve</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ryan who he hung out with.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Awesome beard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really cool guy.</v>

1375
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:23.230
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely work at shaving shortly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Manly beard or Roche,</v>

1376
01:04:23.411 --> 01:04:27.540
<v Speaker 4>mostly manly beer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I saw you just tune in his ball.</v>

1377
01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:31.020
<v Speaker 4>You fixed a few things about his stance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't help yourself as soon as</v>

1378
01:04:31.021 --> 01:04:33.270
<v Speaker 4>you see someone and you were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were,</v>

1379
01:04:33.271 --> 01:04:35.940
<v Speaker 4>you're so bored with it at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You started asking me what is he doing</v>

1380
01:04:35.941 --> 01:04:38.190
<v Speaker 4>wrong and like what's wrong here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1381
01:04:38.191 --> 01:04:39.120
<v Speaker 4>I did that for a reason.</v>

1382
01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:42.390
<v Speaker 4>That was part of me coaching you this</v>
<v Speaker 4>weekend actually.</v>

1383
01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:44.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it worked and it was seriously</v>

1384
01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:46.620
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The video was the best part.</v>

1385
01:04:46.621 --> 01:04:49.110
<v Speaker 4>Like showing me a video of the that in</v>
<v Speaker 4>later.</v>

1386
01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:51.180
<v Speaker 4>That was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything was strategic.</v>

1387
01:04:51.181 --> 01:04:53.490
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked you what you thought of him</v>

1388
01:04:53.491 --> 01:04:58.491
<v Speaker 4>because a big part of me knowing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm teaching the right way is once my</v>

1389
01:04:58.831 --> 01:05:01.920
<v Speaker 4>students are able to identify when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>not there.</v>

1390
01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:07.070
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a very important thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that coaches miss is some coaches,</v>

1391
01:05:07.951 --> 01:05:12.330
<v Speaker 4>they want the money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want the student dependent on you</v>

1392
01:05:12.331 --> 01:05:15.330
<v Speaker 4>being there all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to go with you to the</v>

1393
01:05:15.331 --> 01:05:18.430
<v Speaker 4>tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to go with you to the UFC</v>

1394
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:19.510
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1395
01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:24.340
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is like with me</v>
<v Speaker 3>personally,</v>

1396
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:27.460
<v Speaker 3>thankfully if I agree to work with</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

1397
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.790
<v Speaker 3>the reality is I don't get to see you</v>
<v Speaker 3>every week.</v>

1398
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.660
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the people that I work with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I picked because I really want to,</v>

1399
01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:39.780
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy working with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I want you to be able to help</v>

1400
01:05:40.001 --> 01:05:43.570
<v Speaker 3>yourself when I'm not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I mean both of you and I only get</v>

1401
01:05:43.571 --> 01:05:45.820
<v Speaker 3>to see each other every three months</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

1402
01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:51.070
<v Speaker 3>So if I'm not able to be there seeing</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting for three months,</v>

1403
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:53.770
<v Speaker 3>am I a good coach?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you're,</v>

1404
01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:57.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever 89 days,</v>

1405
01:05:57.461 --> 01:05:59.260
<v Speaker 3>you're wondering if you're doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1406
01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:04.690
<v Speaker 3>So when I asked you that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was for a reason because I thought if</v>

1407
01:06:04.691 --> 01:06:07.870
<v Speaker 3>you ever called me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I doing something wrong?</v>

1408
01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.280
<v Speaker 3>I could be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1409
01:06:09.281 --> 01:06:11.110
<v Speaker 3>have your ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a picture and look.</v>

1410
01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Because hopefully we've worked on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same things enough to where you're able</v>

1411
01:06:14.981 --> 01:06:17.710
<v Speaker 3>to identify.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to be able to tell me what</v>

1412
01:06:17.711 --> 01:06:19.240
<v Speaker 3>you're doing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

1413
01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:22.420
<v Speaker 3>I think a good coach does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're secure to do that.</v>

1414
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:26.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want my students to be dependent</v>

1415
01:06:26.141 --> 01:06:27.550
<v Speaker 3>on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want them to,</v>

1416
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:33.100
<v Speaker 3>I want to push myself because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>wondering,</v>

1417
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:37.180
<v Speaker 3>do you know as much as I do right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and can I take this to another level</v>

1418
01:06:37.181 --> 01:06:38.590
<v Speaker 3>where I introduce you to something new?</v>

1419
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:39.481
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1420
01:06:39.481 --> 01:06:44.481
<v Speaker 5>this is something that I've experienced</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a big way with Jujitsu that the very</v>

1421
01:06:44.761 --> 01:06:49.410
<v Speaker 5>best coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not only do they not hold anything back,</v>

1422
01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:54.470
<v Speaker 5>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they encourage their students to be as</v>

1423
01:06:55.411 --> 01:06:58.620
<v Speaker 5>good as them or better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like my friend Eddie Bravo is a perfect</v>

1424
01:06:58.621 --> 01:07:03.030
<v Speaker 5>example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has like this whole team of top</v>

1425
01:07:03.031 --> 01:07:04.590
<v Speaker 5>killers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he's,</v>

1426
01:07:04.591 --> 01:07:08.730
<v Speaker 5>he's really put together this</v>
<v Speaker 5>fascinating style and now has</v>

1427
01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:10.940
<v Speaker 5>incorporated all these leg locks into</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1428
01:07:10.941 --> 01:07:15.941
<v Speaker 5>This fascinating style of Jujitsu and</v>
<v Speaker 5>openly encourages any new moves explores</v>

1429
01:07:17.911 --> 01:07:22.560
<v Speaker 5>and gives everyone credit and they all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all battling it out trying to</v>

1430
01:07:22.561 --> 01:07:25.740
<v Speaker 5>come up with the best method for every</v>
<v Speaker 5>single situation.</v>

1431
01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:28.500
<v Speaker 5>And the only way to do that is to</v>
<v Speaker 5>encourage growth,</v>

1432
01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:32.220
<v Speaker 5>to not be afraid of competition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to embrace losing to your students are</v>

1433
01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.290
<v Speaker 5>getting tapped by your students.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's great.</v>

1434
01:07:34.291 --> 01:07:38.100
<v Speaker 5>It keeps everyone on their toes and</v>
<v Speaker 5>other martial arts don't do that.</v>

1435
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:42.930
<v Speaker 5>Oh I shouldn't say they don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's way less common than the Jiu</v>

1436
01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:44.970
<v Speaker 5>Jitsu community.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like John Jacques Machado is a perfect</v>

1437
01:07:44.971 --> 01:07:46.560
<v Speaker 5>example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he's,</v>

1438
01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:49.620
<v Speaker 5>he's the guy who gave Eddie Bravo's</v>
<v Speaker 5>blackbelt and John Jacques Machado was</v>

1439
01:07:49.621 --> 01:07:54.030
<v Speaker 5>like completely dedicated to making his</v>
<v Speaker 5>students as good as him or better.</v>

1440
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:56.130
<v Speaker 5>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's his hundred percent focus.</v>

1441
01:07:56.131 --> 01:07:58.230
<v Speaker 5>And when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all you're concentrating on is the</v>

1442
01:07:58.231 --> 01:08:01.830
<v Speaker 5>growth and the improvement of the art.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The actual art of Jujitsu.</v>

1443
01:08:01.831 --> 01:08:03.510
<v Speaker 5>And I think the same could be said for</v>
<v Speaker 5>archery.</v>

1444
01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:05.280
<v Speaker 5>Like you're not trying to hold anything</v>
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>

1445
01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:06.830
<v Speaker 5>You're trying to show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1446
01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:10.980
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to put it into someone's</v>
<v Speaker 5>head so they could do the very best job</v>

1447
01:08:10.981 --> 01:08:14.430
<v Speaker 5>they can at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at minimizing all the things that can go</v>

1448
01:08:14.431 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 5>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tune everything right.</v>

1449
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:19.360
<v Speaker 5>And then you'll know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll be able to take steps and it's,</v>

1450
01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 5>it's real similar in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's real similar.</v>

1451
01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like with Eddy say he knew one move so</v>

1452
01:08:25.061 --> 01:08:26.410
<v Speaker 4>he knew the crane kick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1453
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:28.800
<v Speaker 4>That how dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who doesn't involve pain?</v>

1454
01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:31.300
<v Speaker 4>I just stepped out of your leg is</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible.</v>

1455
01:08:31.301 --> 01:08:32.710
<v Speaker 4>Son of a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

1456
01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.510
<v Speaker 4>Every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

1457
01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:37.220
<v Speaker 4>Every 10th player,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu Guy Ludwig.</v>

1458
01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:40.670
<v Speaker 5>Actually use that in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dwayne Bang.</v>

1459
01:08:40.671 --> 01:08:44.360
<v Speaker 5>Ludwig is such a motherfucker who was</v>
<v Speaker 5>beaten this dude up and in the middle of</v>

1460
01:08:44.361 --> 01:08:47.540
<v Speaker 5>beating it was in the king of the cage</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the middle of beating the dude up.</v>

1461
01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:50.690
<v Speaker 5>He goes into the crane kick and this was</v>
<v Speaker 5>when Duane Ludwig,</v>

1462
01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.820
<v Speaker 5>he still a motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't get me wrong,</v>

1463
01:08:52.821 --> 01:08:56.660
<v Speaker 5>but this was when Duane Ludwig was a</v>
<v Speaker 5>young buck wild motherfucker and he was</v>

1464
01:08:56.661 --> 01:09:00.230

<v Speaker 5>So he's fighting this guy in Caney cage</v>

1465
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:04.970
<v Speaker 5>and his standup is just super advanced</v>
<v Speaker 5>for MMA at this point.</v>

1466
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.700
<v Speaker 5>People just did not know what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do with this guy.</v>

1467
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:11.000
<v Speaker 5>He had just wicked stand up and was</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

1468
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:14.150
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very competent and very successful as a</v>

1469
01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:15.440
<v Speaker 5>professional.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kickboxer too.</v>

1470
01:09:15.441 --> 01:09:20.330
<v Speaker 5>He's just super good striker fought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know Ramon dekkers fought like top</v>

1471
01:09:20.331 --> 01:09:22.940
<v Speaker 5>level Moy Thai guys.</v>

<v Speaker 5>and this is Kinda,</v>

1474
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:29.990

<v Speaker 5>time too when he was in mma and when he</v>

1475
01:09:29.991 --> 01:09:33.620

<v Speaker 5>MMA was just not level ready for this</v>

<v Speaker 5>But compared to a good percentage of the</v>

1483
01:09:56.751 --> 01:09:59.150
<v Speaker 5>people that fought in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the kitties fighting is wearing</v>

1501
01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.690
<v Speaker 5>we were talking about bouncy road</v>
<v Speaker 5>boners.</v>

1502
01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.990
<v Speaker 5>If there is something that happens to a</v>
<v Speaker 5>man when he's in a car that's going down</v>

1503
01:10:46.991 --> 01:10:48.910
<v Speaker 5>a bouncy road for too long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rod in my pants.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He should.</v>

1508
01:10:57.750 --> 01:11:00.660
<v Speaker 4>I definitely probably should make sure</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in the mood to see it.</v>

1509
01:11:00.661 --> 01:11:02.370
<v Speaker 4>Really dumb movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1510
01:11:02.371 --> 01:11:05.250
<v Speaker 4>sometimes I think when you did the</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast with Leah,</v>

1511
01:11:05.251 --> 01:11:09.150
<v Speaker 4>you said there's some movies that are so</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad that they're actually good.</v>

1512
01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:11.310
<v Speaker 4>Like baseball's is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1513
01:11:11.311 --> 01:11:13.770

<v Speaker 4>That's John Candy,</v>

1514
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.060
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was supposed to be really</v>

1515
01:11:15.061 --> 01:11:17.060
<v Speaker 4>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

1516
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:21.300
<v Speaker 4>So it's just procrastinate as a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched part of it.</v>

1517
01:11:21.301 --> 01:11:25.720

<v Speaker 4>it's one of the like really big flaws in</v>

1518
01:11:25.721 --> 01:11:28.530

1560
01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.110

1572
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:25.270

<v Speaker 4>white shirt to being in the at like</v>

<v Speaker 4>that was normal.</v>

1575
01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:34.810
<v Speaker 4>And that was on the extreme side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1576
01:14:34.811 --> 01:14:38.530
<v Speaker 4>Look at him.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He did have a good,</v>

1585
01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.420
<v Speaker 4>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He definitely had to get,</v>

1586
01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:00.000

<v Speaker 4>He can't really do anymore.</v>

1589
01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:08.500
<v Speaker 4>I think he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he's doing is taking cycles and</v>

1590
01:15:08.501 --> 01:15:10.810
<v Speaker 4>then these young kids are going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>forget they're gonna forget about</v>

1591
01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:14.470
<v Speaker 4>allergy and then he's going to sneak up</v>
<v Speaker 4>on them again and we're going to know</v>

1592
01:15:14.471 --> 01:15:16.870
<v Speaker 4>we're going to be in on it and he's just</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to figure it out.</v>

1593
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:18.790
<v Speaker 4>How to get like people that just missed</v>
<v Speaker 4>the boat,</v>

1594
01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.520
<v Speaker 4>they won't wanna know what's and he'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>be able to bank a bunch of them.</v>

1595
01:15:21.710 --> 01:15:23.110
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can't release them.</v>

1596
01:15:23.111 --> 01:15:24.880
<v Speaker 4>Well he have to do is attack a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1597
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:29.620
<v Speaker 4>Do like a several seasons worth before</v>
<v Speaker 4>he released any of it.</v>

1598
01:15:29.621 --> 01:15:32.630
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's what he's been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Regurge red band.</v>

1599
01:15:32.650 --> 01:15:35.220
<v Speaker 4>Think he saw him one night at the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 4>store hanging around.</v>

1600
01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:37.480
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it disappeared and he thought he</v>

1601
01:15:37.481 --> 01:15:39.940
<v Speaker 4>saw cameras and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But knowing that nothing ever came of</v>

1602
01:15:39.941 --> 01:15:40.774
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he might have,</v>

1603
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:45.610
<v Speaker 4>but he got sued by a bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he got sued by those young kids</v>

1604
01:15:45.611 --> 01:15:49.390
<v Speaker 4>that he had on like where they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying would they say something that was</v>

1605
01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:51.730
<v Speaker 4>racially inappropriate or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>along those lines?</v>

1606
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:53.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That lady with the poop sued too,</v>

1607
01:15:53.561 --> 01:15:54.580

<v Speaker 4>Oh good.</v>

1608
01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:55.810
<v Speaker 4>We're there.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1610
01:15:59.530 --> 01:16:01.640
<v Speaker 4>When he's carrying around the Poop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't be doing that.</v>

1611
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:05.830
<v Speaker 4>Was it someone's 15 yet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's super inappropriate because caveman</v>

1612
01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:07.570
<v Speaker 4>with some bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1613
01:16:07.571 --> 01:16:08.980
<v Speaker 4>that's not butter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just black.</v>

1614
01:16:09.010 --> 01:16:11.050
<v Speaker 4>It's just bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We change things around.</v>

1615
01:16:11.051 --> 01:16:12.230
<v Speaker 4>You know what happens man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I,</v>

1616
01:16:12.231 --> 01:16:14.680
<v Speaker 4>the butter coffee podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I phlegm,</v>

1617
01:16:14.681 --> 01:16:17.400
<v Speaker 4>I get coffee flamethrower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kept it cleaner.</v>

1618
01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:20.260
<v Speaker 4>It's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's super annoying.</v>

1619
01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:22.400
<v Speaker 4>Annoying to me and to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1620
01:16:22.401 --> 01:16:23.110
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1621
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:27.130
<v Speaker 4>How come we got off the archery subject?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were finally like definitely on par.</v>

1622
01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.350
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a very,</v>

1623
01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:33.340
<v Speaker 4>you're very advanced for an archer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's worth not giving</v>

1624
01:16:33.341 --> 01:16:34.660
<v Speaker 4>credit to you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1625
01:16:34.661 --> 01:16:37.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm only advanced cause you dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for cause cameron hands.</v>

1626
01:16:37.290 --> 01:16:39.070
<v Speaker 4>Well Cameron Hanes for introducing it to</v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

1627
01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:43.000
<v Speaker 4>You for a tightening everything up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking the time to,</v>

1628
01:16:43.001 --> 01:16:46.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean even you have a guy who was an</v>
<v Speaker 4>Olympic coach and archery and uh,</v>

1629
01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:49.630
<v Speaker 4>to get someone like you for a Dork like</v>
<v Speaker 4>me who just gets into it,</v>

1630
01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:50.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was really fascinated by it.</v>

1631
01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:53.160
<v Speaker 4>I feel very fortunate to be your friend</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you,</v>

1632
01:16:53.190 --> 01:16:55.240
<v Speaker 4>you've taught me some stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>changed,</v>

1633
01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:59.350
<v Speaker 4>like probably taking not just years off</v>
<v Speaker 4>of my progress,</v>

1634
01:16:59.590 --> 01:17:04.000
<v Speaker 4>but changed it the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like it didn't matter like five years</v>

1635
01:17:04.001 --> 01:17:06.820
<v Speaker 4>down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might be better at doing it wrong to</v>

1636
01:17:06.821 --> 01:17:09.920
<v Speaker 4>the point where I kinda have my brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>calculated how to do it.</v>

1637
01:17:10.090 --> 01:17:12.680
<v Speaker 5>I practice it enough so I can do it</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong and still get away with it.</v>

1638
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:14.980
<v Speaker 3>You had a good detour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1639
01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:20.010
<v Speaker 3>You literally went from a super cool</v>
<v Speaker 3>hardcore bow hunter to like,</v>

1640
01:17:20.710 --> 01:17:25.690
<v Speaker 3>how do I become the best at shooting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then now you're Joe Rogan,</v>

1641
01:17:25.691 --> 01:17:28.660
<v Speaker 3>the hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well to me it's a,</v>

1642
01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:31.750
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to say.</v>

1643
01:17:31.751 --> 01:17:34.000
<v Speaker 5>It's the most honest cause.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's still,</v>

1644
01:17:34.001 --> 01:17:36.210
<v Speaker 5>you're still arrow and an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1645
01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:38.200
<v Speaker 5>You're still using a weapon and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>still killing it,</v>

1646
01:17:38.201 --> 01:17:43.201
<v Speaker 5>but it's many levels of removement from</v>
<v Speaker 5>any other kind of eating meat,</v>

1647
01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:47.500
<v Speaker 5>many levels of removement and this is</v>
<v Speaker 5>where it gets really fucking squirrely</v>

1648
01:17:47.501 --> 01:17:52.501
<v Speaker 5>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's way more respectful of the animal</v>

1649
01:17:52.871 --> 01:17:56.470
<v Speaker 5>than eating meat in any other way and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that's hard for people to wrap</v>

1650
01:17:56.471 --> 01:17:58.840
<v Speaker 5>their heads around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I totally understand it.</v>

1651
01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:02.260
<v Speaker 5>I totally understand that it's hard for</v>
<v Speaker 5>people to wrap their heads around and p</v>

1652
01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:04.210
<v Speaker 5>I totally understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're annoyed,</v>

1653
01:18:04.211 --> 01:18:06.430
<v Speaker 5>it's me talking about it too much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about that?</v>

1654
01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:07.820
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

1655
01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:13.180
<v Speaker 3>All the hunters definitely appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 3>you standing up for what you're kind of</v>

1656
01:18:13.181 --> 01:18:14.260
<v Speaker 3>seeing the light on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1657
01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.570
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would be a huge hypocrite if I didn't</v>

1658
01:18:16.571 --> 01:18:21.430
<v Speaker 5>point it out because there's something</v>
<v Speaker 5>going on where people are deciding that</v>

1659
01:18:21.431 --> 01:18:25.240
<v Speaker 5>there are certain executioners they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>allowed to kill your meat and then the</v>

1660
01:18:25.241 --> 01:18:27.670
<v Speaker 5>rest of us are not allowed to partake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you do,</v>

1661
01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:31.000
<v Speaker 5>then you're some sort of a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you let an animal exists in its</v>

1662
01:18:31.001 --> 01:18:34.840
<v Speaker 5>natural state until one day with a ton</v>
<v Speaker 5>of practice,</v>

1663
01:18:34.841 --> 01:18:36.310
<v Speaker 5>I know how much you practice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

1664
01:18:36.311 --> 01:18:38.770
<v Speaker 5>How long have you been shooting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've been shooting archery for?</v>

1665
01:18:38.771 --> 01:18:39.604
<v Speaker 5>How long now?</v>

1666
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:42.440
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At 32</v>

1667
01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:43.720
<v Speaker 5>one year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>31 years.</v>

1668
01:18:43.721 --> 01:18:46.420
<v Speaker 5>Many of those years competitively.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you still practice it every day?</v>

1669
01:18:46.570 --> 01:18:48.290
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the most important things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1670
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.460
<v Speaker 5>I've</v>

1671
01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:50.560
<v Speaker 3>competed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've competed.</v>

1672
01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:51.910
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>

1673
01:18:52.450 --> 01:18:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Competed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say I've competed 25 years.</v>

1674
01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reason,</v>

1675
01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:03.360
<v Speaker 3>the only reason I competed was because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to make sure that when I was</v>

1676
01:19:03.731 --> 01:19:05.860
<v Speaker 3>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was proficient as a hunter.</v>

1677
01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:10.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the only reason I started</v>
<v Speaker 3>competing was I wanted to make sure</v>

1678
01:19:10.391 --> 01:19:11.410
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1679
01:19:11.411 --> 01:19:14.890
<v Speaker 3>I remember going out the first time as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunter and finally having an opportunity</v>

1680
01:19:14.891 --> 01:19:18.160
<v Speaker 3>and then missing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think I was a lot like you when</v>

1681
01:19:18.161 --> 01:19:20.850
<v Speaker 3>you got into it and you realize this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>something I'm really into.</v>

1682
01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:22.270
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1683
01:19:22.330 --> 01:19:25.150
<v Speaker 3>how do I actually get good at it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go out.</v>

1684
01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go out and shoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1685
01:19:27.041 --> 01:19:30.190
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up the butthole or whatever it is,</v>

1686
01:19:30.191 --> 01:19:31.180
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1687
01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:33.220
<v Speaker 3>I want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to make,</v>

1688
01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:35.050
<v Speaker 3>I want to literally make a good shot.</v>

1689
01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:40.150
<v Speaker 3>I want this to be something that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool with and then I want to be able to</v>

1690
01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:44.530
<v Speaker 3>enjoy the benefits of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I started competing was</v>

1691
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:47.290
<v Speaker 3>actually went to my first archery</v>
<v Speaker 3>tournament,</v>

1692
01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:49.180
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on the side,</v>

1693
01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:53.320
<v Speaker 3>a sign on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was driving down the road and I saw a</v>

1694
01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:57.250
<v Speaker 3>sign that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and for those of you who are listening,</v>

1695
01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:59.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was actually a cool little like</v>

1696
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:04.450
<v Speaker 3>documentary that hoyt did for me called</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am defiant.</v>

1697
01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were part of that whole post.</v>

1698
01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:07.730
<v Speaker 3>Probably the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if somebody programs.</v>

1699
01:20:07.731 --> 01:20:10.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone's listening and they kind of</v>

1700
01:20:10.441 --> 01:20:15.441
<v Speaker 3>want to see my background and know how</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of Joe and I came together that um,</v>

1701
01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:19.440
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am defiant video from hoyt is really</v>

1702
01:20:19.441 --> 01:20:21.000
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can find it on youtube.</v>

1703
01:20:21.001 --> 01:20:22.680
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1704
01:20:22.681 --> 01:20:26.940
<v Speaker 3>I was supposed to play college football</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was a bow hunter,</v>

1705
01:20:26.941 --> 01:20:28.680
<v Speaker 3>but I wasn't very good at it.</v>

1706
01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:31.050
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have anyone that really taught</v>
<v Speaker 3>me how to do it.</v>

1707
01:20:31.051 --> 01:20:34.440
<v Speaker 3>I was self taught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad introduced me to it and my uncle</v>

1708
01:20:34.441 --> 01:20:38.700
<v Speaker 3>mainly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I ended up going to this</v>

1709
01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:40.950
<v Speaker 3>archery tournament based on a sign on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the side of the road,</v>

1710
01:20:40.951 --> 01:20:43.830
<v Speaker 3>said archery tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I went there,</v>

1711
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:50.000
<v Speaker 3>I lost all my arrows before I'd finished</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was so bad at shooting and</v>

1712
01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.800
<v Speaker 3>being a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1713
01:20:52.801 --> 01:20:56.370
<v Speaker 3>a person that was really wanting to play</v>
<v Speaker 3>college football.</v>

1714
01:20:56.790 --> 01:21:01.790
<v Speaker 3>That was like the first time I really</v>
<v Speaker 3>felt defeat and just the competitive</v>

1715
01:21:02.610 --> 01:21:05.850
<v Speaker 3>drive in me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to do this right.</v>

1716
01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:10.740
<v Speaker 3>So the people that won that tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them had these shirts on that had</v>

1717
01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:15.240
<v Speaker 3>the name of the shop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the next day I was in that shop and I</v>

1718
01:21:15.241 --> 01:21:19.140
<v Speaker 3>was just watching these people shooting</v>
<v Speaker 3>and started asking questions and I</v>

1719
01:21:19.141 --> 01:21:24.141
<v Speaker 3>realized that myself taught or family</v>
<v Speaker 3>taught way was just a way to get in.</v>

1720
01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:29.280
<v Speaker 3>But then it just got so much more</v>
<v Speaker 3>diverse and I think that's what</v>

1721
01:21:29.281 --> 01:21:30.660
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1722
01:21:30.661 --> 01:21:33.690
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cam was like your uncle,</v>

1723
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:36.210
<v Speaker 3>he literally brought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he brought you into,</v>

1724
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:37.860
<v Speaker 3>he brought you into archery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1725
01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:39.000
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1726
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:39.833
<v Speaker 3>once you're</v>

1727
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:42.630
<v Speaker 5>uncle cam nylon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that'd be awesome.</v>

1728
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:44.410
<v Speaker 5>You need,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need to do a,</v>

1729
01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:47.610
<v Speaker 5>we need to do a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like my crazy uncle that runs ultra</v>

1730
01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:48.444
<v Speaker 5>marathons.</v>

1731
01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:50.180
<v Speaker 3>We need to do a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1732
01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:53.270
<v Speaker 3>a photoshop thing with Cam and an Uncle</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam outfit.</v>

1733
01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.700
<v Speaker 3>But Uncle Cam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1734
01:21:55.730 --> 01:21:58.040
<v Speaker 3>he brought you into archery and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you were there,</v>

1735
01:21:58.050 --> 01:21:59.420
<v Speaker 3>you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

1736
01:21:59.810 --> 01:22:02.570
<v Speaker 3>when I go out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a huge responsibility.</v>

1737
01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:07.880
<v Speaker 3>So how do I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I go out and if I'm going to put</v>

1738
01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:12.830
<v Speaker 3>this responsibility in my hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I make sure I'm 100% knowing I'm</v>

1739
01:22:12.831 --> 01:22:13.150
<v Speaker 3>doing it</v>

1740
01:22:13.150 --> 01:22:15.070
<v Speaker 5>the right way?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me just point out that this is not</v>

1741
01:22:15.071 --> 01:22:16.750
<v Speaker 5>because I didn't have confidence that</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cam,</v>

1742
01:22:16.751 --> 01:22:19.930
<v Speaker 5>it's more that I am a junkie for</v>
<v Speaker 5>exploring options.</v>

1743
01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:22.570
<v Speaker 5>And I get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I get into something,</v>

1744
01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:26.820
<v Speaker 5>I start trying to find all the different</v>
<v Speaker 5>variations.</v>

1745
01:22:27.670 --> 01:22:30.370
<v Speaker 5>I tried to find out who's doing what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the target shooters do and what</v>

1746
01:22:30.371 --> 01:22:31.780
<v Speaker 5>did this go like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

1747
01:22:31.810 --> 01:22:35.320
<v Speaker 5>it's undeniable that Cameron Hanes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like one of the greatest bull hunters in</v>

1748
01:22:35.321 --> 01:22:36.700
<v Speaker 5>the history of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1749
01:22:36.701 --> 01:22:38.260
<v Speaker 5>So just becoming friends with him is</v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing.</v>

1750
01:22:38.261 --> 01:22:40.090
<v Speaker 5>And I should probably just follow his</v>
<v Speaker 5>lead.</v>

1751
01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:43.600
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But my thought is I know that that works</v>

1752
01:22:43.630 --> 01:22:46.570
<v Speaker 5>and I know that works for him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I know that there's certain things</v>

1753
01:22:46.571 --> 01:22:48.160
<v Speaker 5>that work for me that don't work for my</v>
<v Speaker 5>friends.</v>

1754
01:22:48.161 --> 01:22:50.830
<v Speaker 5>Like I have friends that won't do yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucking Love Yoga.</v>

1755
01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:53.080
<v Speaker 5>I have friends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have friends who won't float.</v>

1756
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:54.820
<v Speaker 5>I fucking love floating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

1757
01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:56.410
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to the loaded yet</v>

1758
01:22:57.010 --> 01:22:58.420
<v Speaker 5>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to try it.</v>

1759
01:22:59.110 --> 01:23:00.220
<v Speaker 5>Go try it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh look it up.</v>

1760
01:23:00.490 --> 01:23:01.180
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1761
01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:03.970
<v Speaker 5>It's the greatest thing of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] it up next to like a four or</v>

1762
01:23:03.971 --> 01:23:04.960
<v Speaker 5>five things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1763
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll look it up</v>

1764
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:10.210
<v Speaker 1>and be knocking on like pull a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>strings to make it happen.</v>

1765
01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:13.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna call a guy door to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>basement when to call a guy.</v>

1766
01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:17.260
<v Speaker 1>You can put me in this dark room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>open it up after my plane leaves is one</v>

1767
01:23:17.261 --> 01:23:20.890
<v Speaker 1>of the greatest things of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you do it you realize like why am I</v>

1768
01:23:20.891 --> 01:23:23.680
<v Speaker 1>not doing this all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It lengthens your body out.</v>

1769
01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Everything just sort of relaxes and sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of um,</v>

1770
01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:29.650
<v Speaker 1>gives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know like there's like tight areas</v>

1771
01:23:29.651 --> 01:23:32.590
<v Speaker 1>and your back besides like the mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>properties,</v>

1772
01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:36.310
<v Speaker 1>the things that you can do mentally that</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the big things it does is all the</v>

1773
01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:41.050
<v Speaker 1>magnesium gets inside your muscles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a massive epsom salt bath.</v>

1774
01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:44.980
<v Speaker 1>So everything just gets loose and is</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly a smell in there.</v>

1775
01:23:45.190 --> 01:23:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What salt?</v>

1776
01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:47.620
<v Speaker 1>It's just a salt smell.</v>

1777
01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:48.880
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to do dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1778
01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I hold onto my hips like this when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it and I can make my back pop like a</v>

1779
01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:55.870
<v Speaker 1>lat spread like I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1780
01:23:55.871 --> 01:23:59.170
<v Speaker 1>But I'm like pushing down on my hips and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could feel,</v>

1781
01:23:59.950 --> 01:24:02.470
<v Speaker 1>I could feel my back pop and looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dude.</v>

1782
01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:04.210
<v Speaker 1>It's strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>V Big Man.</v>

1783
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I bet you lift weights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you do.</v>

1784
01:24:08.130 --> 01:24:10.600
<v Speaker 1>I sling some K bs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get in there man.</v>

1785
01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:13.270
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you do any sort of decompression</v>

1786
01:24:13.271 --> 01:24:13.991
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever look,</v>

1787
01:24:13.991 --> 01:24:18.820
<v Speaker 1>hang by your ankles or hang like</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually do a lot of hangs.</v>

1788
01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Those are great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two things or one thing I want to,</v>

1789
01:24:21.881 --> 01:24:25.090
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you we were doing,</v>

1790
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.760
<v Speaker 1>I did that stock because you were tagged</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1791
01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:31.810
<v Speaker 1>So I did that stock had a really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>stock.</v>

1792
01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:34.810
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't a sow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was game over like that.</v>

1793
01:24:35.130 --> 01:24:37.300
<v Speaker 1>You got within how many feet?</v>

1794
01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably eight yards,</v>

1795
01:24:41.831 --> 01:24:44.230
<v Speaker 1>nine yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I stopped and came back and then</v>

1796
01:24:44.231 --> 01:24:46.510
<v Speaker 1>came back in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animal stayed in its place.</v>

1797
01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:51.310
<v Speaker 1>So you were so quiet at 235 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to crawl through the grass.</v>

1798
01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I got video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of creepy.</v>

1799
01:24:53.050 --> 01:24:56.020
<v Speaker 1>He told me I was like a Predator is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking big predator.</v>

1800
01:24:56.021 --> 01:24:59.530
<v Speaker 1>It's creepy to watch the holding your</v>
<v Speaker 1>bow and Arrow creeping up on these</v>

1801
01:24:59.531 --> 01:25:01.870
<v Speaker 1>animals moving so slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>

1802
01:25:01.871 --> 01:25:05.170
<v Speaker 1>I give credit to that for yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1803
01:25:05.171 --> 01:25:06.300
<v Speaker 1>that helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you notice that?</v>

1804
01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you put that together?</v>

1805
01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.200
<v Speaker 1>When I was going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I know you've been doing it and I</v>

1806
01:25:11.201 --> 01:25:12.700
<v Speaker 1>know you like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just thought you,</v>

1807
01:25:12.701 --> 01:25:15.280
<v Speaker 1>you're a big athletic guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you played football and I know</v>

1808
01:25:15.281 --> 01:25:17.410
<v Speaker 1>you run a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mountain bike a lot.</v>

1809
01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the difference of your body.</v>

1810
01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:23.050
<v Speaker 1>Slow movements is way different than</v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

1811
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1812
01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:29.160
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think I really credit yoga.</v>

1813
01:25:29.770 --> 01:25:32.040
<v Speaker 1>My wife started doing it and she kept</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying like,</v>

1814
01:25:32.050 --> 01:25:35.530
<v Speaker 1>you really need to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I heard you talking about</v>

1815
01:25:35.531 --> 01:25:38.800
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried it and then now I'm to the point</v>

1816
01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:42.940
<v Speaker 1>where I do it and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I wish all guys,</v>

1817
01:25:42.941 --> 01:25:46.270
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's if archers could only</v>
<v Speaker 1>do one thing,</v>

1818
01:25:46.271 --> 01:25:48.820
<v Speaker 1>I would say find a really good yoga</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1819
01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:53.350
<v Speaker 1>If they could do two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say yoga and kettle bells and</v>

1820
01:25:53.351 --> 01:25:56.110
<v Speaker 1>then if they could do three things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say yoga,</v>

1821
01:25:56.111 --> 01:25:58.780
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells and God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be tough.</v>

1822
01:25:59.290 --> 01:26:03.550
<v Speaker 1>I'd say weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then heart rate is relative to take</v>

1823
01:26:03.551 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>cardio</v>

1824
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.570
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just feel like your ability to</v>

1825
01:26:08.571 --> 01:26:13.571
<v Speaker 3>maintain posture is really relative to</v>
<v Speaker 3>yoga.</v>

1826
01:26:15.650 --> 01:26:20.650
<v Speaker 3>So like when I was stocking one thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you did that when I was filming and</v>

1827
01:26:22.011 --> 01:26:26.330
<v Speaker 3>I stayed back just for sound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stayed back and let you do your thing.</v>

1828
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:31.390
<v Speaker 3>I've wished I was the guide at that</v>
<v Speaker 3>point where I could tell you because you</v>

1829
01:26:31.461 --> 01:26:33.680
<v Speaker 3>were behind the guide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he didn't really know what you're</v>

1830
01:26:33.681 --> 01:26:35.600
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was really wishing I could say</v>

1831
01:26:35.601 --> 01:26:40.601
<v Speaker 3>like your bow instead of being sideways</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's easiest to carry,</v>

1832
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.050
<v Speaker 3>it needs to be at the ready and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>

1833
01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:48.500
<v Speaker 3>everything you did need to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's your martial arts background,</v>

1834
01:26:48.501 --> 01:26:50.870
<v Speaker 3>but you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when we'll get on this subject,</v>

1835
01:26:50.871 --> 01:26:55.871
<v Speaker 3>but you were going this way and this way</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this way,</v>

1836
01:26:57.681 --> 01:27:01.550
<v Speaker 3>so you're like your angle of attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though it was in a straight line,</v>

1837
01:27:01.551 --> 01:27:06.380
<v Speaker 3>it was still horizontal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas did you notice my angle attack</v>

1838
01:27:06.381 --> 01:27:11.381
<v Speaker 3>was always at a posture to where I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>move 28 inches and I was where I needed</v>

1839
01:27:13.611 --> 01:27:14.444
<v Speaker 3>to be draw,</v>

1840
01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:16.130
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1841
01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:19.100
<v Speaker 5>I definitely once,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once we talked about that afterwards,</v>

1842
01:27:19.101 --> 01:27:20.300
<v Speaker 5>I got that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That made sense.</v>

1843
01:27:20.301 --> 01:27:23.960
<v Speaker 5>I did feel weird though about holding up</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bowl while this dude is front of me.</v>

1844
01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.030
<v Speaker 5>I did feel weird about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1845
01:27:26.031 --> 01:27:28.520
<v Speaker 5>I gotta have this point into the side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't feel right.</v>

1846
01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:31.500
<v Speaker 5>Even though it takes a whole step to</v>
<v Speaker 5>pull it back and draw,</v>

1847
01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:35.600
<v Speaker 5>it just didn't feel right to like have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bow pointed towards some dude's back.</v>

1848
01:27:35.601 --> 01:27:36.800
<v Speaker 5>I know it's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1849
01:27:36.801 --> 01:27:38.240
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is sort of,</v>

1850
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:40.760
<v Speaker 5>but it's not because if someone tripped</v>
<v Speaker 5>or something went wrong,</v>

1851
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.140
<v Speaker 5>but I do think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing yoga has made my ability to move</v>

1852
01:27:45.141 --> 01:27:46.730
<v Speaker 5>slower,</v>
<v Speaker 5>better as well.</v>

1853
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:49.220
<v Speaker 5>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I was talking about earlier about</v>

1854
01:27:49.221 --> 01:27:51.290
<v Speaker 5>lifting weights and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's nothing wrong with lifting weights,</v>

1855
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:55.130
<v Speaker 5>but I think there's an overlooked thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we were talking about in the car.</v>

1856
01:27:55.190 --> 01:27:58.850
<v Speaker 5>It's being able to control your body and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what yoga does almost better than</v>

1857
01:27:58.851 --> 01:28:01.610
<v Speaker 5>anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The balance that you get in the,</v>

1858
01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:04.700
<v Speaker 5>the ability to move your body and all</v>
<v Speaker 5>these different ways.</v>

1859
01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:08.480
<v Speaker 5>It just doesn't seem as sexy as like</v>
<v Speaker 5>squats or dead lifts.</v>

1860
01:28:08.481 --> 01:28:09.314
<v Speaker 5>Fuck,</v>

1861
01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:12.270
<v Speaker 3>we do dead lifts if feels like you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting some shit done.</v>

1862
01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:13.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love dead lifts.</v>

1863
01:28:13.801 --> 01:28:15.770
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm getting callous.</v>

1864
01:28:15.771 --> 01:28:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Has done like these babies are from</v>
<v Speaker 3>dental bell dead lifts dead well</v>

1865
01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:22.680
<v Speaker 3>kettlebells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I get more pressure on my</v>

1866
01:28:22.681 --> 01:28:24.840
<v Speaker 3>forearms from channel that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>hanks to right.</v>

1867
01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:26.550
<v Speaker 3>That'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll definitely give you some houses.</v>

1868
01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:29.190
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean for a lot of people,</v>

1869
01:28:29.191 --> 01:28:34.140
<v Speaker 3>I think a very neglective movement and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>heard this on your podcast and I called</v>

1870
01:28:34.141 --> 01:28:34.831
<v Speaker 3>you and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1871
01:28:34.831 --> 01:28:37.170
<v Speaker 3>I do those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just hanging,</v>

1872
01:28:37.890 --> 01:28:42.450
<v Speaker 3>literally grabbing a bar and fully</v>
<v Speaker 3>extending yourself to where your bay,</v>

1873
01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:44.190
<v Speaker 3>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a long gates,</v>

1874
01:28:44.191 --> 01:28:47.100
<v Speaker 3>your joints.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it just brings so much like</v>

1875
01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:51.330
<v Speaker 3>lubrication to your joints and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer I hang,</v>

1876
01:28:51.331 --> 01:28:53.550
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you hear yourself adjust?</v>

1877
01:28:53.610 --> 01:28:57.810
<v Speaker 3>Do you hear like little things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Click hopping in my lower back too.</v>

1878
01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if I can get a place longer.</v>

1879
01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:02.020
<v Speaker 3>We have a hard time getting way you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could feet could</v>

1880
01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:02.940
<v Speaker 4>dangle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

1881
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:05.310
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing about being short.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you get a good one,</v>

1882
01:29:05.311 --> 01:29:07.880
<v Speaker 4>you're freaking dangle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do at the playground.</v>

1883
01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:13.110
<v Speaker 4>I have to go to a freaking tough mudder</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get my feet.</v>

1884
01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:14.790
<v Speaker 4>Do you go to a playground?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of these playgrounds,</v>

1885
01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.400
<v Speaker 4>that goddamn brutal kids keep breaking</v>
<v Speaker 4>their arm and they've got damn monkey</v>

1886
01:29:17.401 --> 01:29:18.950
<v Speaker 4>bars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah man,</v>

1887
01:29:18.951 --> 01:29:20.280
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my daughter broke her arm and a monkey</v>

1888
01:29:20.281 --> 01:29:21.920
<v Speaker 4>bars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of her friends at school broke her</v>

1889
01:29:21.921 --> 01:29:24.540
<v Speaker 4>arm and a monkey bars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I broke my arm on monkey bars.</v>

1890
01:29:24.541 --> 01:29:28.200
<v Speaker 4>Monkeys buys or fucking dangerous man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I want these kids bell from metal</v>

1891
01:29:28.201 --> 01:29:30.660
<v Speaker 4>bars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See when you're falling you're only</v>

1892
01:29:30.661 --> 01:29:33.480
<v Speaker 4>phone a few inches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's different from everybody else.</v>

1893
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:36.090
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's why I like my size.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you fall off the monkey bars,</v>

1894
01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:38.640
<v Speaker 4>a fucking long drop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of action.</v>

1895
01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:43.560
<v Speaker 4>But when you can hang from something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is all from my friend Steve Maxwell</v>

1896
01:29:43.561 --> 01:29:44.460
<v Speaker 4>told me all about this.</v>

1897
01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:46.770
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get podcasts phenomenal and he's</v>

1898
01:29:46.771 --> 01:29:48.270
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it allows your,</v>

1899
01:29:48.271 --> 01:29:51.570
<v Speaker 4>your arms to like sort of loosen up</v>
<v Speaker 4>those joints.</v>

1900
01:29:51.571 --> 01:29:54.690
<v Speaker 4>And give them some mobility and</v>
<v Speaker 4>flexibility and it makes a big</v>

1901
01:29:54.691 --> 01:29:55.141
<v Speaker 4>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

1902
01:29:55.141 --> 01:29:56.340
<v Speaker 4>I made a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me.</v>

1903
01:29:56.610 --> 01:29:58.810
<v Speaker 4>Soon as I started doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really changed when my shoulder</v>

1904
01:29:58.811 --> 01:29:59.940
<v Speaker 4>started feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1905
01:29:59.941 --> 01:30:02.400
<v Speaker 4>we both have had shoulder problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1906
01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:04.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just located mine.</v>

1907
01:30:04.171 --> 01:30:06.360
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did see I was the same.</v>

1908
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:09.360
<v Speaker 4>I dislocated in mine and it froze.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when I,</v>

1909
01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:14.870
<v Speaker 4>when I was like too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too ignorant to know that it was a</v>

1910
01:30:15.001 --> 01:30:19.230
<v Speaker 4>frozen shoulder and I forced myself to</v>
<v Speaker 4>like talk myself into the fact that it</v>

1911
01:30:19.231 --> 01:30:24.030
<v Speaker 4>wasn't a rotator,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it went back in and that noise,</v>

1912
01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.260
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1913
01:30:25.261 --> 01:30:27.180
<v Speaker 4>you know the noise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the noise,</v>

1914
01:30:27.181 --> 01:30:29.070
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was really shocked when I heard</v>

1915
01:30:29.071 --> 01:30:31.170
<v Speaker 4>that ours didn't clunk in.</v>

1916
01:30:31.230 --> 01:30:33.310
<v Speaker 4>I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember it when I get sad,</v>

1917
01:30:33.330 --> 01:30:34.650
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the injury,</v>

1918
01:30:34.651 --> 01:30:36.600
<v Speaker 4>like the way the inside tissue looked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

1919
01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:38.850
<v Speaker 4>it looks like your shoulder was</v>
<v Speaker 4>disconnected just located.</v>

1920
01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.530
<v Speaker 4>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you sure?</v>

1921
01:30:40.531 --> 01:30:40.951
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1922
01:30:40.951 --> 01:30:44.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure it's like the way you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have these little bits floating around</v>

1923
01:30:44.491 --> 01:30:45.360
<v Speaker 4>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1924
01:30:45.361 --> 01:30:47.550
<v Speaker 4>usually that happens when a shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets dislocated.</v>

1925
01:30:48.150 --> 01:30:50.700
<v Speaker 4>Oh</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1926
01:30:50.701 --> 01:30:53.640
<v Speaker 4>mine wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember Sharon looking at me and she</v>

1927
01:30:53.641 --> 01:30:56.370
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was that a good pop or a bad up?</v>

1928
01:30:56.730 --> 01:30:59.670
<v Speaker 4>And I said it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't the good one.</v>

1929
01:30:59.790 --> 01:31:03.480
<v Speaker 4>Definitely wasn't seat short faced bears</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have these kind of weak ass bitch</v>

1930
01:31:03.481 --> 01:31:06.420
<v Speaker 4>body problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What those short faced bears,</v>

1931
01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:07.950
<v Speaker 4>they don't have these bitch body</v>
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>

1932
01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:13.800
<v Speaker 4>Problems pull trees out of the roots and</v>
<v Speaker 4>beat people desperately have knee</v>

1933
01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:16.020
<v Speaker 4>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lower back problems.</v>

1934
01:31:16.330 --> 01:31:18.420
<v Speaker 4>They get talk that would make them so</v>
<v Speaker 4>much creepier.</v>

1935
01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:23.940
<v Speaker 4>No uhler fuck you telling me you</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't have a short face bear here if</v>

1936
01:31:24.001 --> 01:31:26.970
<v Speaker 4>you knew he wasn't like a mean one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See you say that.</v>

1937
01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.580
<v Speaker 4>But if he's a short face bear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a mean one.</v>

1938
01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:30.710
<v Speaker 4>That's like saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1939
01:31:30.711 --> 01:31:32.010
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's rude.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Sharks I've encountered,</v>

1942
01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:44.070
<v Speaker 4>I've encountered a lot of bears and</v>
<v Speaker 4>bears have personalities.</v>

1943

<v Speaker 4>I'm sure some bears have very short</v>
<v Speaker 4>tempers and their,</v>

1961
01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:39.640
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know your relationship with</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim Miller.</v>

1967
01:32:48.851 --> 01:32:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if most people who listen to this</v>

1968
01:32:50.951 --> 01:32:55.510
<v Speaker 4>podcast to follow the UFC know Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a one of the top 10.</v>

1969
01:32:55.511 --> 01:32:57.550
<v Speaker 4>I think he's top 10 lightweight in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1970
01:32:57.551 --> 01:32:59.260
<v Speaker 4>Just lost a really close fight to</v>
<v Speaker 4>dustin.</v>

1971
01:32:59.261 --> 01:33:00.094
<v Speaker 4>Pour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Awesome fight.</v>

1975
01:33:03.670 --> 01:33:06.760

<v Speaker 4>certainly top 15 in my eyes,</v>

1976
01:33:06.761 --> 01:33:08.710
<v Speaker 4>at least he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying top somebody.</v>

1977
01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:12.040
<v Speaker 4>Well that's hard to argue honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause he's,</v>

1978
01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:16.000
<v Speaker 4>he's lost to some of the best guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's still Tony Ferguson.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They have to fight for the title.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But did he lose with he lost with a</v>

1982

<v Speaker 4>close fight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1983
01:33:23.650 --> 01:33:24.310

<v Speaker 4>We talked about that.</v>

1986

1989
01:33:34.271 --> 01:33:39.271
<v Speaker 4>watched one where I felt I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had vestments in someone and you know,</v>

1990
01:33:42.401 --> 01:33:46.420
<v Speaker 4>I knew Jim was fighting for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was that two eight cause I saw him fight</v>

1991
01:33:46.421 --> 01:33:48.610
<v Speaker 4>at 200 and he stood on the cage and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

1992
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:51.760
<v Speaker 4>cause I was sitting right behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any like,</v>

1993
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:52.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said let's go.</v>

1994
01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:56.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how cool was that?</v>

1995
01:33:56.021 --> 01:33:59.380
<v Speaker 4>It was very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that you're sitting there and the guy</v>

1996
01:33:59.381 --> 01:34:01.480
<v Speaker 4>just wins a fight in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first thing he wants to do is go</v>

1997
01:34:01.481 --> 01:34:05.380
<v Speaker 4>over and point to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>200 let's go out and that was so</v>

1998
01:34:05.381 --> 01:34:07.960
<v Speaker 4>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so bored when both those guys</v>

1999
01:34:07.961 --> 01:34:08.541
<v Speaker 4>have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

2000
01:34:08.541 --> 01:34:09.820
<v Speaker 4>I was so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2001
01:34:09.821 --> 01:34:14.480
<v Speaker 4>it's so cool and I've got both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Both of them are coming to Iowa in the</v>

2002
01:34:14.481 --> 01:34:16.750
<v Speaker 4>fine for the Turkey belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One month they're fighting for the</v>

2003
01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:20.530
<v Speaker 4>Turkey belt and I'm in there too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to bitch slap those suckers.</v>

2004
01:34:21.190 --> 01:34:23.230
<v Speaker 4>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Turkey belt is a thing that John has</v>

2005
01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:26.140
<v Speaker 4>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our bitch knock on loud in UFC.</v>

2006
01:34:26.170 --> 01:34:28.000
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should be.</v>

2007
01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:30.220
<v Speaker 4>If I don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't know what's coming.</v>

2008
01:34:30.221 --> 01:34:32.530
<v Speaker 4>Wait until this bitch supposed to have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>closed hand,</v>

2009
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:34.760
<v Speaker 4>but you can slap some on the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>head though.</v>

2010
01:34:34.810 --> 01:34:37.210
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to put all 15 inches.</v>

01:34:37.211 --> 01:34:39.610
<v Speaker 4>This bitch slap right across both of</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2012
01:34:39.850 --> 01:34:41.770
<v Speaker 4>I think it's probably better to punch</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone.</v>

2013
01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:44.050
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise people would just be bitch</v>
<v Speaker 4>slap and people.</v>

2014
01:34:44.170 --> 01:34:47.200
<v Speaker 4>They used to be an organization called</v>
<v Speaker 4>pancreas and they used to only bitch</v>

2015
01:34:47.201 --> 01:34:49.000
<v Speaker 4>slap for real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2016
01:34:49.001 --> 01:34:50.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pancreas was not allowed to strike with</v>

2017
01:34:50.921 --> 01:34:53.510
<v Speaker 4>a closed fist except to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It was crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You get to do so machado stuff.</v>

2113
01:38:52.050 --> 01:38:53.910
<v Speaker 4>What else do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who do you learn pool from?</v>

2114
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:55.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I've,</v>

2115
01:38:55.651 --> 01:38:57.600
<v Speaker 4>I've had a bunch of friends there were</v>
<v Speaker 4>really good at pool,</v>

2116
01:38:57.630 --> 01:38:59.610
<v Speaker 4>but one of the big ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend Max eberly,</v>

2117
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.640
<v Speaker 4>he thinks the world's flat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wonderful Guy.</v>

2118
01:39:03.150 --> 01:39:07.320
<v Speaker 4>A Max [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a fantastic pool player.</v>

2119
01:39:07.321 --> 01:39:09.320
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is going to be at a Max.</v>

2120
01:39:09.330 --> 01:39:10.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's fundamentals</v>

2121
01:39:10.930 --> 01:39:15.610
<v Speaker 5>cool that that mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't mirror the consequences or</v>

2122
01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:19.840
<v Speaker 5>the actions of archery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they mirror the mindset and the</v>

2123
01:39:19.841 --> 01:39:24.841
<v Speaker 5>proper form and the proper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the proper delivery with the minimal</v>

2124
01:39:24.941 --> 01:39:29.740
<v Speaker 5>amount of like variables,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like muscle movement or torquing of the</v>

2125
01:39:29.741 --> 01:39:32.890
<v Speaker 5>hand or all those things that is very</v>
<v Speaker 5>similar in pool.</v>

2126
01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.770
<v Speaker 5>Like when you get really good at pool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm definitely not really good,</v>

2127
01:39:35.771 --> 01:39:39.160
<v Speaker 5>but when you get to a certain level and</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are really good,</v>

2128
01:39:39.310 --> 01:39:40.750
<v Speaker 5>they get this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2129
01:39:40.751 --> 01:39:43.000
<v Speaker 5>it's like I used to play eight to 10</v>
<v Speaker 5>hours a day.</v>

2130
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:45.040
<v Speaker 5>Like all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're saying you weren't good.</v>

2131
01:39:45.130 --> 01:39:48.580
<v Speaker 5>I was never like world class.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was never like even national class.</v>

2132
01:39:48.581 --> 01:39:51.800
<v Speaker 5>I was like always a b player.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like at my very best I was a beat.</v>

2133
01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:55.070
<v Speaker 5>This is totally being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there was a players and there</v>

2134
01:39:55.071 --> 01:39:56.170
<v Speaker 5>was pros,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2135
01:39:56.230 --> 01:39:58.570
<v Speaker 5>I was never an a player,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I learned how to get,</v>

2136
01:39:58.571 --> 01:40:01.510
<v Speaker 5>I got better and better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if I played for many,</v>

2137
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:03.250
<v Speaker 5>many hours in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd start getting loose and I could run</v>

2138
01:40:03.251 --> 01:40:05.350
<v Speaker 5>some racks sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was never a real good player.</v>

2139
01:40:05.530 --> 01:40:08.860
<v Speaker 5>But one of the things that I realized is</v>
<v Speaker 5>that when I played my best,</v>

2140
01:40:09.010 --> 01:40:11.680
<v Speaker 5>I was barely holding the cue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's barely holding it.</v>

2141
01:40:11.710 --> 01:40:14.740
<v Speaker 5>It's like I knew that the less control I</v>
<v Speaker 5>had of it,</v>

2142
01:40:14.741 --> 01:40:16.270
<v Speaker 5>the more I could let the queue do the</v>
<v Speaker 5>work.</v>

2143
01:40:16.271 --> 01:40:19.570
<v Speaker 5>And I had it tuned into my mind and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was all about being in the correct</v>

2144
01:40:19.571 --> 01:40:22.150
<v Speaker 5>stance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>making sure that you come through the</v>

2145
01:40:22.151 --> 01:40:24.060
<v Speaker 5>ball perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Meaning that like the delivery,</v>

2146
01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:27.430
<v Speaker 5>the stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where it's just this natural smooth</v>

2147
01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:30.200
<v Speaker 5>motion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you do that you,</v>

2148
01:40:30.210 --> 01:40:34.000
<v Speaker 5>you get to this state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they called dead punch or you get into</v>

2149
01:40:34.001 --> 01:40:36.570
<v Speaker 5>dead stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like some guys call it dead punched,</v>

2150
01:40:36.571 --> 01:40:39.640
<v Speaker 5>some guys called dead stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you're in dead stroke you can't</v>

2151
01:40:39.641 --> 01:40:40.420
<v Speaker 5>mess.</v>

2152
01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:43.990
<v Speaker 5>You see the ball different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see angles on the ball.</v>

2153
01:40:44.170 --> 01:40:46.510
<v Speaker 5>You see when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you know that when you release the</v>

2154
01:40:46.511 --> 01:40:48.310
<v Speaker 5>cue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you let that cue go forward,</v>

2155
01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:53.170
<v Speaker 5>that tip is going to smoothly striked</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cue ball and it's going to collide</v>

2156
01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:56.530
<v Speaker 5>perfectly with the ball that you are</v>
<v Speaker 5>aiming at is going to go to the center</v>

2157
01:40:56.531 --> 01:40:59.440
<v Speaker 5>of the pocket and it's going to roll the</v>
<v Speaker 5>perfect position and you might only be</v>

2158
01:40:59.441 --> 01:41:01.120
<v Speaker 5>able to do that like a game or two in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>row.</v>

2159
01:41:01.210 --> 01:41:03.850
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never got into it where it stuck with</v>

2160
01:41:03.851 --> 01:41:07.300
<v Speaker 5>me for like hours and hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I had a friend,</v>

2161
01:41:07.301 --> 01:41:09.370
<v Speaker 5>my friend Johnny B,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who I grew up with,</v>

2162
01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:14.880
<v Speaker 5>grew up in pool with who was a hustler.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I met him when he was a pool hustler and</v>

2163
01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:19.450
<v Speaker 5>he was this really fucking smart dude</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was good at,</v>

2164
01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:21.970
<v Speaker 5>he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he could play chess.</v>

2165
01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:26.650
<v Speaker 5>He could do numbers in his head like you</v>
<v Speaker 5>could throw 500 times a thousand minus</v>

2166
01:41:26.651 --> 01:41:31.510
<v Speaker 5>six divided by three he'd go forward 65</v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely before 65 but he could do</v>

2167
01:41:31.511 --> 01:41:32.920
<v Speaker 5>that like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was weird.</v>

2168
01:41:32.921 --> 01:41:35.650
<v Speaker 5>He had a weird math brain that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>understand at all.</v>

2169
01:41:35.890 --> 01:41:38.080
<v Speaker 5>And he would get to the asperger's or</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2170
01:41:38.081 --> 01:41:39.680
<v Speaker 5>it was just a brilliant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just his just,</v>

2171
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:42.550
<v Speaker 5>his mind was different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a different mind.</v>

2172
01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:47.560
<v Speaker 5>One of the first people I've ever met</v>
<v Speaker 5>who his mind was just so different than</v>

2173
01:41:47.561 --> 01:41:50.050
<v Speaker 5>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the way he thought about things and</v>

2174
01:41:50.051 --> 01:41:52.900
<v Speaker 5>the way his brain would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the RPM considered different?</v>

2175
01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:54.011
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2176
01:41:54.011 --> 01:41:58.390
<v Speaker 5>He was normal street smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very street smart and fun and funny</v>

2177
01:41:58.391 --> 01:42:00.310
<v Speaker 5>character,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's really a lot of different</v>

2178
01:42:00.311 --> 01:42:01.960
<v Speaker 5>traits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy who would get,</v>

2179
01:42:01.961 --> 01:42:05.740
<v Speaker 5>he would get loose when we play pool and</v>
<v Speaker 5>for hours he would be in this dead</v>

2180
01:42:05.741 --> 01:42:07.120
<v Speaker 5>stroke where it was just insane.</v>

2181
01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:07.960
<v Speaker 5>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you couldn't,</v>

2182
01:42:08.190 --> 01:42:10.450
<v Speaker 5>you people would gather around and watch</v>
<v Speaker 5>him play.</v>

2183
01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:13.150
<v Speaker 5>They would gather around and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were watching an art form.</v>

2184
01:42:13.390 --> 01:42:17.230
<v Speaker 5>Like he had this way of getting out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had his way of moving a ball around</v>

2185
01:42:17.231 --> 01:42:20.020
<v Speaker 5>the table that was so smooth and</v>
<v Speaker 5>elegant.</v>

2186
01:42:20.021 --> 01:42:23.710
<v Speaker 5>If you did it yourself and you realize</v>
<v Speaker 5>how difficult it is to watch,</v>

2187
01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:28.950
<v Speaker 5>it's a different perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But pool is is a beautiful art form that</v>

2188
01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:32.290
<v Speaker 5>only the people who know how to do it</v>
<v Speaker 5>can appreciate.</v>

2189
01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:36.130
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's the same with archery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things about archery is</v>

2190
01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:41.230
<v Speaker 5>if you watch a guy like yourself or any</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the top target archers and you see</v>

2191
01:42:41.231 --> 01:42:45.250
<v Speaker 5>those guys on the TV and the Olympics</v>
<v Speaker 5>and their aim at those spots and they</v>

2192
01:42:45.251 --> 01:42:48.100
<v Speaker 5>release that Arrow and it goes to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>center at home,</v>

2193
01:42:48.101 --> 01:42:49.360
<v Speaker 5>you're watching it going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yay,</v>

2194
01:42:49.361 --> 01:42:50.420
<v Speaker 5>he got another bulls eye.</v>

2195
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:52.180
<v Speaker 5>Or again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I misses and you're like,</v>

2196
01:42:52.181 --> 01:42:55.060
<v Speaker 5>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're watching these guys do 10 in a</v>

2197
01:42:55.061 --> 01:42:56.020
<v Speaker 5>row,</v>
<v Speaker 5>12 in a row.</v>

2198
01:42:56.110 --> 01:42:58.120
<v Speaker 5>But when you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you realize like,</v>

2199
01:42:58.210 --> 01:43:01.390
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a mirror into the mind.</v>

2200
01:43:01.690 --> 01:43:06.490
<v Speaker 5>This is one of many disciplines that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>Amir into the mind.</v>

2201
01:43:06.491 --> 01:43:09.340
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get to peer into an area of yourself</v>

2202
01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:12.580
<v Speaker 5>like internally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you get to figure out through these</v>

2203
01:43:12.581 --> 01:43:16.010
<v Speaker 5>motions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like where your mind's at and how to</v>

2204
01:43:16.011 --> 01:43:19.780
<v Speaker 5>discipline this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this sort of process of learning and</v>

2205
01:43:19.781 --> 01:43:21.670
<v Speaker 5>getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And archery is a weird one,</v>

2206
01:43:21.671 --> 01:43:23.590
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where to seems like it should be so</v>

2207
01:43:23.591 --> 01:43:25.360
<v Speaker 5>simple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what's so hard?</v>

2208
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:27.400
<v Speaker 5>You put your arm out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you aim,</v>

2209
01:43:27.490 --> 01:43:29.110
<v Speaker 5>you let the Arrow go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it,</v>

2210
01:43:29.111 --> 01:43:29.810
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2211
01:43:29.810 --> 01:43:33.070
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why this same thing.</v>

2212
01:43:33.071 --> 01:43:36.730
<v Speaker 5>They're shooting at the same spot for</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same distance over and over and over</v>

2213
01:43:36.731 --> 01:43:39.010
<v Speaker 5>and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's insanely difficult and you have</v>

2214
01:43:39.011 --> 01:43:41.320
<v Speaker 5>to be a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's insanely difficult.</v>

2215
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:45.580
<v Speaker 5>You have to re replicate your movements</v>
<v Speaker 5>and smoothness and your breathing is</v>

2216
01:43:45.581 --> 01:43:50.050
<v Speaker 5>important and your concentration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a fascinating discipline,</v>

2217
01:43:50.051 --> 01:43:51.310
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fascinating.</v>

2218
01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 5>And if I never bow</v>

2219
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:57.160
<v Speaker 4>hunted again for the rest of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would 100% still practice our tree.</v>

2220
01:43:58.510 --> 01:44:01.400
<v Speaker 4>100% it's a form of meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

2221
01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:03.830
<v Speaker 4>It's a spectacular one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2222
01:44:03.831 --> 01:44:07.100
<v Speaker 4>because it's so rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when were practicing,</v>

2223
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:10.040
<v Speaker 4>we were at camp practicing out to 90</v>
<v Speaker 4>yards.</v>

2224
01:44:10.041 --> 01:44:12.680
<v Speaker 4>That was as much fun as hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

2225
01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:13.910
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2226
01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:17.450
<v Speaker 4>It's the the most fun way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was I in that,</v>

2227
01:44:18.110 --> 01:44:20.450
<v Speaker 4>what was your Pool Guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Johnny B.</v>

2228
01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:21.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Johnny B zone.</v>

2229
01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:25.070
<v Speaker 4>You're definitely in a Johnny B zone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're always in a johnny b zone</v>

2230
01:44:25.071 --> 01:44:26.450
<v Speaker 4>with archery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very annoying.</v>

2231
01:44:27.010 --> 01:44:28.800
<v Speaker 4>It's like he just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

2232
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:32.630
<v Speaker 4>we had a pie plate out at 90 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This mother fucker like pop right in the</v>

2233
01:44:32.631 --> 01:44:33.560
<v Speaker 4>middle of the pie plate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2234
01:44:33.561 --> 01:44:37.250
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck can even see that far?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't even see what that thing is.</v>

2235
01:44:37.251 --> 01:44:38.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You hit it.</v>

2236
01:44:38.241 --> 01:44:39.560
<v Speaker 4>You're lying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hit it a few times,</v>

2237
01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:41.030
<v Speaker 4>but I miss it a bunch of times too.</v>

2238
01:44:41.050 --> 01:44:43.130
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my point is that like you're,</v>

2239
01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:45.470
<v Speaker 4>you're the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're so technical,</v>

2240
01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:48.740
<v Speaker 4>you're amazingly consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's one I was saying earlier,</v>

2241
01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:50.450
<v Speaker 4>like even though you've been doing this</v>
<v Speaker 4>for so long,</v>

2242
01:44:50.451 --> 01:44:53.360
<v Speaker 4>you still practice every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the crazy part about it.</v>

2243
01:44:53.361 --> 01:44:56.720
<v Speaker 4>That it is this discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fascinating discipline,</v>

2244
01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:58.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then start to,</v>

2245
01:44:59.090 --> 01:45:02.300
<v Speaker 4>you start to really crave that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you and I were talking with Steve</v>

2246
01:45:02.301 --> 01:45:03.830
<v Speaker 4>About.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He kept saying,</v>

2247
01:45:04.190 --> 01:45:07.430
<v Speaker 4>I want to get into working out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't,</v>

2248
01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:09.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's all these buts,</v>

2249
01:45:09.890 --> 01:45:13.520
<v Speaker 4>but you and I were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2250
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:17.540
<v Speaker 4>we're to the point where that is part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>our lifestyle.</v>

2251
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's part of our daily routine.</v>

2252
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:25.870
<v Speaker 4>If I don't go to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's to me if I don't somehow test my</v>

2253
01:45:27.921 --> 01:45:29.460
<v Speaker 4>body each day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether,</v>

2254
01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:31.580
<v Speaker 4>well one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's with archery,</v>

2255
01:45:31.730 --> 01:45:35.510
<v Speaker 4>I test my body practicing and then I</v>
<v Speaker 4>also test my body.</v>

2256
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:38.930
<v Speaker 4>Whether I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether I do yoga day or kettle bells or</v>

2257
01:45:38.931 --> 01:45:43.160
<v Speaker 4>whether I lift or whether I bike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either way it's a task,</v>

2258
01:45:43.161 --> 01:45:45.770
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's part of my routine.</v>

2259
01:45:45.771 --> 01:45:47.420
<v Speaker 4>No different than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2260
01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:51.950
<v Speaker 4>our series lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to brush my teeth every day life.</v>

2261
01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:55.250
<v Speaker 4>I always want to see Harry every morning</v>
<v Speaker 4>before he goes to school,</v>

2262
01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:57.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to see your wife and you want</v>

2263
01:45:57.321 --> 01:45:59.600
<v Speaker 4>to talk to your wife and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in bed or whatever.</v>

2264
01:45:59.601 --> 01:46:01.970
<v Speaker 4>You always want to have that connection</v>
<v Speaker 4>time for you to sleep.</v>

2265
01:46:02.650 --> 01:46:06.800
<v Speaker 4>That's part of a routine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And once you get into that routine,</v>

2266
01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:11.150
<v Speaker 4>your body craves it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't want to miss that part.</v>

2267
01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:12.441
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also,</v>

2268
01:46:12.441 --> 01:46:16.040
<v Speaker 4>you can regulate through those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that I've noticed</v>

2269
01:46:16.041 --> 01:46:21.041
<v Speaker 4>is when I've taken days off of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>exercise and I've done it many times and</v>

2270
01:46:21.051 --> 01:46:24.950
<v Speaker 4>I did it pretty recently because I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of feeling sick.</v>

2271
01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:29.150
<v Speaker 4>I was like just kind of feeling kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>crappy and my kids had colds and I was</v>

2272
01:46:29.151 --> 01:46:29.984
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2273
01:46:30.290 --> 01:46:32.030
<v Speaker 4>I might be coming down with something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I said,</v>

2274
01:46:32.031 --> 01:46:33.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to just chill out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to,</v>

2275
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:35.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go ahead by the war.</v>

2276
01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:37.670
<v Speaker 4>I'd never be that guy who don't worry</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>

2277
01:46:37.671 --> 01:46:38.780
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can make it happen.</v>

2278
01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:40.040
<v Speaker 4>Bladders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right there.</v>

2279
01:46:40.670 --> 01:46:44.480
<v Speaker 4>Go through that door and golden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2280
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:49.340
<v Speaker 4>what was I just talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you colds.</v>

2281
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 4>So what I did</v>

2282
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:54.920
<v Speaker 5>was I took like maybe four or five days</v>
<v Speaker 5>off work and at,</v>

2283
01:46:54.930 --> 01:46:58.950
<v Speaker 5>which is super unusual for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just said I feel just a little tired</v>

2284
01:46:59.130 --> 01:47:01.650
<v Speaker 5>and I know this is going around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel it trying to creep in.</v>

2285
01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:03.780
<v Speaker 5>So I took extra care,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my health,</v>

2286
01:47:03.781 --> 01:47:08.580
<v Speaker 5>I took extra care to drink like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>green juices and eat a lot of probiotics</v>

2287
01:47:08.910 --> 01:47:10.620
<v Speaker 5>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me just recognize what this thing is</v>

2288
01:47:10.621 --> 01:47:13.770
<v Speaker 5>and catch it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did some breathing exercises so I never</v>

2289
01:47:13.771 --> 01:47:16.680
<v Speaker 5>got sick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what I did do is I took all that</v>

2290
01:47:16.681 --> 01:47:20.820
<v Speaker 5>time away from working out and I started</v>
<v Speaker 5>feeling not so happy.</v>

2291
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:24.600
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't want to say I was depressed</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I definitely wasn't,</v>

2292
01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:28.260
<v Speaker 5>but I felt a difference between my</v>
<v Speaker 5>happiness level.</v>

2293
01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:32.430
<v Speaker 5>Then what my happiness level is when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2294
01:47:32.490 --> 01:47:36.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm blowing out all the stress when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>blowing out all the stress.</v>

2295
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:39.600
<v Speaker 5>Then I look at life as this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know it's not going to last forever,</v>

2296
01:47:39.601 --> 01:47:41.910
<v Speaker 5>but it is awesome right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2297
01:47:41.911 --> 01:47:45.000
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't I just smile and enjoy this</v>
<v Speaker 5>awesome thing right now?</v>

2298
01:47:45.001 --> 01:47:46.110
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course I should.</v>

2299
01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:50.400
<v Speaker 5>And so I embrace the awesome things</v>
<v Speaker 5>about this awesome life and try to take</v>

2300
01:47:50.401 --> 01:47:53.940
<v Speaker 5>them all in as much as I can and just</v>
<v Speaker 5>enjoy the moment.</v>

2301
01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:58.080
<v Speaker 5>But when I exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that comes almost natural.</v>

2302
01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:00.600
<v Speaker 5>It just feels like the thing to think of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing,</v>

2303
01:48:00.601 --> 01:48:02.370
<v Speaker 5>the way to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if I exercise hard,</v>

2304
01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:06.540
<v Speaker 5>if I can get through a brutal workout,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sky seems brighter,</v>

2305
01:48:06.541 --> 01:48:09.750
<v Speaker 5>the air seems clean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>air people seem happier.</v>

2306
01:48:10.050 --> 01:48:14.070
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I can change the way I</v>
<v Speaker 5>interface with the world around me.</v>

2307
01:48:14.071 --> 01:48:16.920
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not just as simple as you know,</v>

2308
01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:20.070
<v Speaker 5>you work out because it's good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you work out it cause it's,</v>

2309
01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.600
<v Speaker 5>it's good for life.</v>

2310
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:26.870
<v Speaker 5>And I just think it's so easy to fall</v>
<v Speaker 5>prey to our natural instincts to want to</v>

2311
01:48:28.591 --> 01:48:31.920
<v Speaker 5>be comfortable all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think the more you do that,</v>

2312
01:48:31.921 --> 01:48:34.980
<v Speaker 5>the mall more you fall prey to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>natural instinct of wanting to be</v>

2313
01:48:34.981 --> 01:48:39.981
<v Speaker 5>comfortable at the time you deny the</v>
<v Speaker 5>observable Yin and Yang to the universe</v>

2314
01:48:40.710 --> 01:48:44.400
<v Speaker 5>that the universe requires these moments</v>
<v Speaker 5>of discomfort,</v>

2315
01:48:44.401 --> 01:48:47.580
<v Speaker 5>like hard workout sessions and in order</v>
<v Speaker 5>for you to feel good.</v>

2316
01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:51.630
<v Speaker 5>And I also think your body has these</v>
<v Speaker 5>natural reward systems that have been</v>

2317
01:48:52.290 --> 01:48:56.160
<v Speaker 5>implanted in us through millions and</v>
<v Speaker 5>millions of years of being whatever the</v>

2318
01:48:56.161 --> 01:48:57.960
<v Speaker 5>fuck we were when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2319
01:48:57.990 --> 01:49:01.020
<v Speaker 5>millions of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people have these things</v>

2320
01:49:01.021 --> 01:49:05.550
<v Speaker 5>embedded in their head and they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a certain requirement of,</v>

2321
01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:07.740
<v Speaker 5>of panic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a certain requirement of</v>

2322
01:49:07.741 --> 01:49:09.990
<v Speaker 5>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a certain requirement of</v>

2323
01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:12.960
<v Speaker 5>protecting your environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>surrounding,</v>

2324
01:49:13.110 --> 01:49:16.350
<v Speaker 5>recognizing the dangers around you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like how much of that is left.</v>

2325
01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:19.770
<v Speaker 5>Well if you grow up in the inner city</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it really gang infested crime ridden</v>

2326
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:22.560
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's way higher ramped up than it is.</v>

2327
01:49:22.561 --> 01:49:25.230
<v Speaker 5>If you know you're a kid in beverly</v>
<v Speaker 5>hills and your parents are super rich</v>

2328
01:49:25.231 --> 01:49:28.470
<v Speaker 5>and their parents were super rich and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't understand like what it's like</v>

2329
01:49:28.471 --> 01:49:30.200
<v Speaker 5>to be in a dangerous place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2330
01:49:30.250 --> 01:49:32.370
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean people were very strange.</v>

2331
01:49:32.371 --> 01:49:34.770
<v Speaker 5>John Jug,</v>
<v Speaker 5>John Dudley and we're very strange.</v>

2332
01:49:34.771 --> 01:49:37.530
<v Speaker 5>Don Judge John,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking very well,</v>

2333
01:49:37.531 --> 01:49:38.990
<v Speaker 5>a buddy of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2334
01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:43.800
<v Speaker 5>dusty filling up in BC one time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what a great name.</v>

2335
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:46.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dusty Philly in the fillings are</v>

2336
01:49:46.051 --> 01:49:47.320
<v Speaker 5>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love those guys.</v>

2337
01:49:47.321 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 5>But it sounds like a</v>

2338
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.250
<v Speaker 4>character on a Stephen King Book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's awesome.</v>

2339
01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:53.230
<v Speaker 4>Found a spaceship with Jeremy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna give a shout out to both of</v>

2340
01:49:53.231 --> 01:49:54.064
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Screw it,</v>

2341
01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:55.030
<v Speaker 4>Jeremy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2342
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:57.580
<v Speaker 4>he was also awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a great name for a Stephen King.</v>

2343
01:49:57.590 --> 01:50:01.480
<v Speaker 4>Both of them are always my camera people</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I'm up in BC hunting.</v>

2344
01:50:02.170 --> 01:50:06.040
<v Speaker 4>And the problem with having a fulltime</v>
<v Speaker 4>camera person,</v>

2345
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:09.280
<v Speaker 4>it would be a lot like you trust in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie with this podcast.</v>

2346
01:50:09.281 --> 01:50:14.281
<v Speaker 4>If he was also potentially like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>personality of Jackass.</v>

2347
01:50:16.330 --> 01:50:18.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would think that</v>

2348
01:50:20.690 --> 01:50:21.580
<v Speaker 4>I gave them my</v>

2349
01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:26.110
<v Speaker 3>camera and they had it because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to make sure it was always</v>

2350
01:50:26.111 --> 01:50:28.480
<v Speaker 3>charged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The card was always empty.</v>

2351
01:50:29.170 --> 01:50:32.410
<v Speaker 3>So when I get home and I load all my</v>
<v Speaker 3>footage,</v>

2352
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:33.640
<v Speaker 3>I have this</v>

2353
01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:37.910
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these recoveries by my animals or my</v>

2354
01:50:37.911 --> 01:50:42.911
<v Speaker 4>hunts with them posing as don gently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the guy that you trust.</v>

2355
01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:47.360
<v Speaker 4>Like when we trusted Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we said,</v>

2356
01:50:47.361 --> 01:50:48.830
<v Speaker 4>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get a picture of us,</v>

2357
01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:52.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>glass and over here and then all it is</v>

2358
01:50:52.411 --> 01:50:56.000
<v Speaker 4>is this big freaking beard taking</v>
<v Speaker 4>selfies.</v>

2359
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:59.390
<v Speaker 4>He took every reason he was pretending</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take our picture.</v>

2360
01:50:59.391 --> 01:51:01.620
<v Speaker 4>He took selfies and then we got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck man?</v>

2361
01:51:01.630 --> 01:51:03.440
<v Speaker 4>He starts laughing and then he took the</v>
<v Speaker 4>pictures.</v>

2362
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:05.810
<v Speaker 4>He was a funny dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A really funny dude.</v>

2363
01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:08.810
<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was real cool and really good at his</v>

2364
01:51:08.811 --> 01:51:11.300
<v Speaker 4>job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knew that place like the back of his</v>

2365
01:51:11.301 --> 01:51:12.290
<v Speaker 4>hand gesture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

2366
01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:17.180
<v Speaker 4>pleasure to hang out with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was made an awesome [inaudible].</v>

2367
01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:19.220
<v Speaker 4>He did good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful as well.</v>

2368
01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2369
01:51:22.140 --> 01:51:24.180
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I walked in you were talking about</v>

2370
01:51:24.330 --> 01:51:26.280
<v Speaker 3>kind of the importance of the Yin and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yang.</v>

2371
01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:30.390
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think with any sport that's an</v>

2372
01:51:30.391 --> 01:51:33.180
<v Speaker 3>individual sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when it's a finesse sport,</v>

2373
01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:36.990
<v Speaker 3>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times you have to lose control</v>

2374
01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:42.020
<v Speaker 3>and especially lose the ego in order to</v>
<v Speaker 3>excel in the outcome.</v>

2375
01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:50.060
<v Speaker 3>So like a lot of the ways that I coach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take away your ability to control and</v>

2376
01:51:50.881 --> 01:51:52.410
<v Speaker 3>then slowly bring it back to you</v>

2377
01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:54.740
<v Speaker 4>and what people don't understand what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're saying.</v>

2378
01:51:54.770 --> 01:51:57.320
<v Speaker 4>Let me just explain to people that have</v>
<v Speaker 4>no idea what archery is.</v>

2379
01:51:57.321 --> 01:52:00.590
<v Speaker 4>If you're still here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just kidding.</v>

2380
01:52:00.620 --> 01:52:03.830
<v Speaker 4>Millions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what I'm saying is that when you are</v>

2381
01:52:03.860 --> 01:52:06.260
<v Speaker 4>learn our true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that happens to some</v>

2382
01:52:06.261 --> 01:52:08.300
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should say a lot of people as you get</v>

2383
01:52:08.301 --> 01:52:12.350
<v Speaker 4>something called target panic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that means like what you try to do</v>

2384
01:52:12.351 --> 01:52:13.760
<v Speaker 4>is you try to have a hole on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here,</v>

2385
01:52:13.970 --> 01:52:16.390
<v Speaker 4>let me explain it to people I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they don't know you.</v>

2386
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:17.930
<v Speaker 4>You get scared of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2387
01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:19.610
<v Speaker 4>it's scared of the word good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2388
01:52:19.730 --> 01:52:21.400
<v Speaker 4>But it's a good subject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go ahead.</v>

2389
01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:22.520
<v Speaker 4>Gets mice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2390
01:52:22.610 --> 01:52:23.930
<v Speaker 4>I'll be right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll explain to people.</v>

2391
01:52:23.931 --> 01:52:25.340
<v Speaker 4>Then you'd come back and fill in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>blanks.</v>

2392
01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:26.990
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2393
01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:29.480
<v Speaker 4>people panic the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

2394
01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:33.710
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they panic and they can't keep the spot</v>

2395
01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:35.690
<v Speaker 4>look where they're supposed to aim on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the target.</v>

2396
01:52:36.130 --> 01:52:38.810
<v Speaker 4>Like sometimes they're low,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they're to the left and they</v>

2397
01:52:38.811 --> 01:52:41.840
<v Speaker 4>circle it in there and then pull the</v>
<v Speaker 4>trigger and they freak out.</v>

2398
01:52:41.841 --> 01:52:44.600
<v Speaker 4>And it's weird because it becomes like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the psychological,</v>

2399
01:52:45.110 --> 01:52:45.943
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2400
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:50.360
<v Speaker 5>sort of a trap that they fall into.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's really common with target</v>

2401
01:52:50.361 --> 01:52:52.520
<v Speaker 5>archers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think something has to do with the</v>

2402
01:52:52.521 --> 01:52:56.960
<v Speaker 5>monotony of continuing to stare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At a spot and sometimes being dead on it</v>

2403
01:52:56.961 --> 01:52:59.570
<v Speaker 5>and sometimes not and eventually it</v>
<v Speaker 5>builds up in your head.</v>

2404
01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:02.570
<v Speaker 5>We're trying to figure out how do I time</v>
<v Speaker 5>this thing where I hit that trigger</v>

2405
01:53:02.571 --> 01:53:03.480
<v Speaker 5>perfectly?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2406
01:53:03.481 --> 01:53:08.481
<v Speaker 5>someone figured out a long time ago that</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you use a release that doesn't let</v>

2407
01:53:09.591 --> 01:53:11.840
<v Speaker 5>you know when the arrows going to go</v>
<v Speaker 5>off,</v>

2408
01:53:12.170 --> 01:53:16.400
<v Speaker 5>it's a surprise shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then all those tricks don't get worked</v>

2409
01:53:16.401 --> 01:53:18.650
<v Speaker 5>into your system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the tricks your brain plays on,</v>

2410
01:53:18.651 --> 01:53:23.651
<v Speaker 5>you don't get worked into the system and</v>
<v Speaker 5>John has an amazing method of what in</v>

2411
01:53:25.371 --> 01:53:27.260
<v Speaker 5>what we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking away control.</v>

2412
01:53:27.261 --> 01:53:29.380
<v Speaker 5>So that's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You what you do by taking what you</v>

2413
01:53:29.381 --> 01:53:31.820
<v Speaker 5>controls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you develop this tension release that</v>

2414
01:53:31.821 --> 01:53:34.640
<v Speaker 5>you're just pulling through the shot so</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't anticipate when it's go on</v>

2415
01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:38.060
<v Speaker 5>going off because the muscles are not</v>
<v Speaker 5>nearly as sensitive as the ones that are</v>

2416
01:53:38.061 --> 01:53:40.760
<v Speaker 5>on your finger and anything that's used</v>
<v Speaker 5>to manipulating things.</v>

2417
01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:41.633
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2418
01:53:41.650 --> 01:53:46.650
<v Speaker 3>you literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you minimize your focus on literally a</v>

2419
01:53:47.971 --> 01:53:50.550
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you occupy your conscious mind.</v>

2420
01:53:50.551 --> 01:53:53.760
<v Speaker 3>This is probably equivalent to most</v>
<v Speaker 3>sports,</v>

2421
01:53:53.850 --> 01:53:58.650
<v Speaker 3>but your conscious mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you occupy it with a fight or flight</v>

2422
01:53:58.651 --> 01:54:03.651
<v Speaker 3>syndrome or a fight or flight reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times when people experience</v>

2423
01:54:05.371 --> 01:54:09.420
<v Speaker 3>performance anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're triggering,</v>

2424
01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:13.410
<v Speaker 3>triggering a fight or flight experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2425
01:54:13.411 --> 01:54:14.880
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even with fighters,</v>

2426
01:54:14.881 --> 01:54:18.600
<v Speaker 3>even if they know how to move and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>know how to punch and they have a game</v>

2427
01:54:18.601 --> 01:54:21.310
<v Speaker 3>plan of how they should attacked a</v>
<v Speaker 3>counter.</v>

2428
01:54:21.330 --> 01:54:26.330
<v Speaker 3>Mcgregor once say you get fricking</v>
<v Speaker 3>cracked hard with that left hand,</v>

2429
01:54:27.810 --> 01:54:28.710
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2430
01:54:29.070 --> 01:54:33.840
<v Speaker 3>your conscious mind goes from your</v>
<v Speaker 3>trainer saying slip and moves,</v>

2431
01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:34.770
<v Speaker 3>slipping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>move,</v>

2432
01:54:34.771 --> 01:54:37.620
<v Speaker 3>keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all of a sudden you get hit with</v>

2433
01:54:37.621 --> 01:54:40.920
<v Speaker 3>this thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that occupies your conscious mind to a</v>

2434
01:54:40.921 --> 01:54:45.921
<v Speaker 3>thought of fight or flight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll now it starts thinking about what</v>

2435
01:54:46.201 --> 01:54:48.270
<v Speaker 3>you're doing and then all sudden you go</v>
<v Speaker 3>into attack mode,</v>

2436
01:54:48.271 --> 01:54:48.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2437
01:54:48.510 --> 01:54:52.470
<v Speaker 3>And then your game plans out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's the same thing with archery.</v>

2438
01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:57.500
<v Speaker 3>You want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to occupy your conscious mind</v>

2439
01:54:57.540 --> 01:55:01.350
<v Speaker 3>with the process instead of a result.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2440
01:55:01.710 --> 01:55:03.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good way of putting it.</v>

2441
01:55:03.031 --> 01:55:04.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're,</v>

2442
01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:09.260
<v Speaker 3>we're focusing a hundred percent 100%</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've worked on you with this,</v>

2443
01:55:09.571 --> 01:55:13.890
<v Speaker 3>I've worked on Aubrey with this on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>process and the,</v>

2444
01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:18.450
<v Speaker 3>if you only focus on the process then if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't,</v>

2445
01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:22.260
<v Speaker 3>if that ice shield was out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ice wall and you could never see the</v>

2446
01:55:22.261 --> 01:55:26.670
<v Speaker 3>result,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would guarantee you that the result in</v>

2447
01:55:26.671 --> 01:55:27.950
<v Speaker 3>the end would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2448
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:32.520
<v Speaker 3>if there was someone on the other side</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying Joe Rogan is an unbelievable</v>

2449
01:55:32.521 --> 01:55:36.270
<v Speaker 3>archer because you never knew the result</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are on this side of the Ice Wall</v>

2450
01:55:36.271 --> 01:55:39.150
<v Speaker 3>saying I'm only caring about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

2451
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:44.310
<v Speaker 3>So I take away all the tools of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you've</v>

2452
01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:47.850
<v Speaker 4>essentially those tools are what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>came up with on your own when you said,</v>

2453
01:55:47.851 --> 01:55:51.600
<v Speaker 4>I want to get into archery and I bring</v>
<v Speaker 4>you into a process.</v>

2454
01:55:52.050 --> 01:55:57.050
<v Speaker 4>And then once you understand that</v>
<v Speaker 4>process and I a hundred percent trust</v>

2455
01:55:57.451 --> 01:56:02.451
<v Speaker 4>that you know the process then all</v>
<v Speaker 4>sudden give you a tool to have ultimate</v>

2456
01:56:04.471 --> 01:56:08.460
<v Speaker 4>control the result which is like what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know for a year I worked with you</v>

2457
01:56:08.461 --> 01:56:11.370
<v Speaker 4>and then in the end you came back to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>NOC to it,</v>

2458
01:56:11.371 --> 01:56:12.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2459
01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:14.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That released that you use,</v>

2460
01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:19.240
<v Speaker 5>well the just the release method of not</v>
<v Speaker 5>having any control over when it goes off</v>

2461
01:56:21.230 --> 01:56:26.060
<v Speaker 5>like that made my archery alone without</v>
<v Speaker 5>the corrections and the form that you</v>

2462
01:56:26.061 --> 01:56:29.030
<v Speaker 5>did for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That made my archery alone more</v>

2463
01:56:29.031 --> 01:56:33.120
<v Speaker 5>effective and more satisfying because</v>
<v Speaker 5>like as we talked about like archery's</v>

2464
01:56:33.121 --> 01:56:38.121
<v Speaker 5>is strange discipline and when someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>points out the pictures to you it's sort</v>

2465
01:56:38.331 --> 01:56:41.570
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it sort of illuminates the process in</v>

2466
01:56:41.571 --> 01:56:43.910
<v Speaker 5>this weird way that makes the process</v>
<v Speaker 5>more exciting.</v>

2467
01:56:43.940 --> 01:56:47.000
<v Speaker 5>Like everything you do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you enjoy doing something when you</v>

2468
01:56:47.001 --> 01:56:48.920
<v Speaker 5>first start doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once you get better at it,</v>

2469
01:56:48.921 --> 01:56:52.670
<v Speaker 5>you're going to enjoy it even more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a big thing with Jujitsu Jitsu</v>

2470
01:56:52.670 --> 01:56:52.850
<v Speaker 5>Jitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2471
01:56:52.850 --> 01:56:57.850
<v Speaker 5>it's a huge part of learning and growing</v>
<v Speaker 5>with Jujitsu is trying it out,</v>

2472
01:56:58.551 --> 01:56:59.990
<v Speaker 5>getting good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then</v>

2473
01:57:00.150 --> 01:57:02.740
<v Speaker 4>call up Jeremiah for me while we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>

2474
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:03.360
<v Speaker 4>We'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>

2475
01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:06.960

<v Speaker 4>I want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you,</v>

<v Speaker 4>They're not going to hurt you.</v>

2480
01:57:12.930 --> 01:57:15.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't want my archery shoulders ripped</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of socket.</v>

2481
01:57:16.170 --> 01:57:18.510
<v Speaker 4>If as long as you learn how to tap out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super important.</v>

2482
01:57:18.511 --> 01:57:21.290
<v Speaker 4>I can tell it to learn how to do that</v>
<v Speaker 4>loud to me.</v>

2483
01:57:21.340 --> 01:57:23.940
<v Speaker 4>I do stuff on big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm willing to submit.</v>

2484
01:57:24.090 --> 01:57:25.140
<v Speaker 4>You gotta do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Sounded super good.</v>

2486
01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:28.620
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's a bear.</v>

2487
01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:31.110
<v Speaker 4>Not a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a bear at the top.</v>

2488
01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:34.650
<v Speaker 4>How's that been?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The like the nomenclature in the gay</v>

2489
01:57:34.651 --> 01:57:36.870
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bears a big furry one,</v>

2490
01:57:36.871 --> 01:57:39.270
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't necessarily mean he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>dominant.</v>

2491
01:57:39.271 --> 01:57:40.170
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where did we go?</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:00.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that there's a problem</v>
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>

2501
01:58:00.481 --> 01:58:03.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying I'm venturing to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>area.</v>

2502
01:58:03.361 --> 01:58:06.600
<v Speaker 4>That's not my expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2503

<v Speaker 4>all the snakes are chasing it.</v>

2637
02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:15.780
<v Speaker 4>That was from planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of those getting hatched on</v>

2638
02:04:15.781 --> 02:04:18.540
<v Speaker 4>the beach and it's running to the rest</v>
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>

2639
02:04:18.541 --> 02:04:21.170
<v Speaker 4>Like group real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was real clumsy.</v>

2640
02:04:22.110 --> 02:04:25.290
<v Speaker 4>Iguana that we're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

2641
02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:28.530
<v Speaker 4>These things look like monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just small.</v>

2642
02:04:28.620 --> 02:04:30.540
<v Speaker 4>That's why Godzilla was such a dope</v>
<v Speaker 4>movie.</v>

2643
02:04:30.780 --> 02:04:32.820
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to learn so much cool</v>

2644
02:04:32.821 --> 02:04:36.270
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When your kids are 17 type in this type</v>

2645
02:04:36.271 --> 02:04:39.360
<v Speaker 4>in um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coral</v>

2646
02:04:41.010 --> 02:04:45.480
<v Speaker 4>ejaculations on full moons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do you know about this?</v>

2647
02:04:46.050 --> 02:04:51.050
<v Speaker 4>Thankfully No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How dare you wait till you find out what</v>

2648
02:04:51.811 --> 02:04:53.760
<v Speaker 4>happens on a full moon in eight o'clock.</v>

2649
02:04:55.050 --> 02:04:55.920
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to know.</v>

2650
02:04:57.250 --> 02:04:58.970
<v Speaker 4>He probably don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to know.</v>

2651
02:04:59.030 --> 02:05:02.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm scared now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a bad hot tub at the Holiday</v>

2652
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:05.570
<v Speaker 4>Inn Express.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it funny that people are so silly?</v>

2653
02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:08.960
<v Speaker 4>Like we know there's sharks in the water</v>
<v Speaker 4>but surfing is so much fun.</v>

2654
02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:10.820
<v Speaker 4>Would take our chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2655
02:05:10.821 --> 02:05:12.920
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's with everything in life.</v>

2656
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:14.720
<v Speaker 4>Dance over the head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's risk.</v>

2657
02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:17.540
<v Speaker 4>That's a big one though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Short little ride.</v>

2658
02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:22.600
<v Speaker 4>Did you find anything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>National Geographic had a special on</v>

2659
02:05:23.180 --> 02:05:28.180
<v Speaker 4>corals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like eight 8:00 PM on a</v>

2660
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:29.143
<v Speaker 4>full moon.</v>

2661
02:05:29.260 --> 02:05:29.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2662
02:05:29.730 --> 02:05:34.730
<v Speaker 4>All I think coral like literally drops</v>
<v Speaker 4>it like it's hot.</v>

2663
02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:37.380
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2664
02:05:37.710 --> 02:05:39.860
<v Speaker 4>And how does it get the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>coral pregnant?</v>

2665
02:05:39.861 --> 02:05:42.150
<v Speaker 4>Cause corals not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a plant.</v>

2666
02:05:42.450 --> 02:05:43.720
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

2667
02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:45.240
<v Speaker 4>is it an asexual?</v>

2668
02:05:45.740 --> 02:05:46.573
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

2669
02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:49.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm seeing this stuff called the corals</v>
<v Speaker 4>spawn.</v>

2670
02:05:49.630 --> 02:05:50.680
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There it is.</v>

2671
02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:52.930
<v Speaker 4>Here's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and after we looked at this,</v>

2672
02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:56.440
<v Speaker 4>we've got to check out all the new shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the Great Barrier Reef.</v>

2673
02:05:56.470 --> 02:05:58.240
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is crazy.</v>

2674
02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:01.720
<v Speaker 4>Look at that creature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is coral.</v>

2675
02:06:02.250 --> 02:06:06.580
<v Speaker 4>This coral orgasms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what that is right there.</v>

2676
02:06:07.050 --> 02:06:09.670
<v Speaker 4>Pretty low.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go in those little holes.</v>

2677
02:06:09.730 --> 02:06:12.640
<v Speaker 4>It's like that game at the carnival,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2678
02:06:12.670 --> 02:06:15.580
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the calm comes out in little balls</v>

2679
02:06:15.581 --> 02:06:18.250
<v Speaker 4>and it goes in these round holes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie type in,</v>

2680
02:06:18.251 --> 02:06:22.570
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>moonlight triggers mass coral romance.</v>

2681
02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:26.050
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

2682
02:06:26.770 --> 02:06:31.600
<v Speaker 4>This is stuff you learn from when you go</v>
<v Speaker 4>to your seven o'clock breakfast with</v>

2683
02:06:31.601 --> 02:06:35.110
<v Speaker 4>your teenager and he's a straight a</v>
<v Speaker 4>student.</v>

2684
02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:36.293
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2685
02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:37.971
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dad,</v>

2686
02:06:37.971 --> 02:06:40.810
<v Speaker 4>did you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2687
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:45.810
<v Speaker 4>The sunlight triggers mass coral.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look how they put romance in quotes.</v>

2688
02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:50.250
<v Speaker 4>It's equally correct till now how the</v>
<v Speaker 4>primitive animals,</v>

2689
02:06:50.251 --> 02:06:53.490
<v Speaker 4>which lack brains or I synchronize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So their animals.</v>

2690
02:06:54.090 --> 02:06:55.230
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't they be,</v>

2691
02:06:55.260 --> 02:06:57.770
<v Speaker 4>would that night be considered a plant?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2692
02:06:57.900 --> 02:07:01.710
<v Speaker 4>This are people that say plants don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>have feelings.</v>

2693
02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:04.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean seriously,</v>

2694
02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:08.360
<v Speaker 4>they're saying it's an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

2695
02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:10.880
<v Speaker 4>What constitutes that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand.</v>

2696
02:07:10.881 --> 02:07:12.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's look that up in a second,</v>

2697
02:07:12.651 --> 02:07:15.290
<v Speaker 4>but synchronize the mass spawning was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>mystery.</v>

2698
02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:16.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2699
02:07:16.701 --> 02:07:20.120
<v Speaker 4>In today's issue of the journal Science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>researchers reveal that they have</v>

2700
02:07:20.150 --> 02:07:25.150
<v Speaker 4>isolated in ancient gene in the corals</v>
<v Speaker 4>DNA that can detect moonlight by</v>

2701
02:07:26.211 --> 02:07:29.540
<v Speaker 4>exposing the corals to different colors</v>
<v Speaker 4>and intensities of light.</v>

2702
02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:34.780
<v Speaker 4>The team found the gene known as C R Y</v>
<v Speaker 4>two was most active in Appro,</v>

2703
02:07:36.170 --> 02:07:37.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crapo.</v>

2704
02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:38.533
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2705
02:07:38.580 --> 02:07:40.600
<v Speaker 1>crobe Po Ra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cro,</v>

2706
02:07:40.620 --> 02:07:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Paul Hra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a corals during a full moon.</v>

2707
02:07:44.470 --> 02:07:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2708
02:07:45.970 --> 02:07:49.870
<v Speaker 1>It encodes a type of protein known as</v>
<v Speaker 1>crypto chrome,</v>

2709
02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:53.170
<v Speaker 1>which appears to trigger the corals</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductive cycle.</v>

2710
02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:57.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a wearable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's literally at 8:00 PM on a full</v>

2711
02:07:57.521 --> 02:07:59.500
<v Speaker 1>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain coral,</v>

2712
02:07:59.530 --> 02:08:01.420
<v Speaker 1>literally it's a werewolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do dallas.</v>

2713
02:08:01.421 --> 02:08:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Getting back to what we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about earlier,</v>

2714
02:08:02.831 --> 02:08:05.710
<v Speaker 1>about bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how strange they are that they</v>

2715
02:08:05.711 --> 02:08:08.830
<v Speaker 1>only breed once a year for most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

2716
02:08:08.831 --> 02:08:12.700
<v Speaker 1>There's no breeding and then something</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens and they all turn into fuck.</v>

2717
02:08:12.750 --> 02:08:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Werewolf's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this bouncing a girl was through as</v>

2718
02:08:18.041 --> 02:08:21.770
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'd be a big sign up at 10th Plan</v>

2719
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2720
02:08:22.751 --> 02:08:24.430
<v Speaker 1>it'd be giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause people would be like,</v>

2721
02:08:24.431 --> 02:08:27.910
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me once a year I got to</v>

2722
02:08:27.911 --> 02:08:31.690
<v Speaker 1>be gangster and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone would take steroids.</v>

2723
02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was steroids,</v>

2724
02:08:34.001 --> 02:08:35.980
<v Speaker 1>grew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you antlers everyone and antlers,</v>

2725
02:08:35.981 --> 02:08:39.640
<v Speaker 1>how did no one would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one accepts natural antlers.</v>

2726
02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:40.540
<v Speaker 1>They would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2727
02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:43.410
<v Speaker 1>all bets are off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're stabbing each other with weapons</v>

2728
02:08:43.411 --> 02:08:46.270
<v Speaker 1>to grow out of our heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't just play by the rules,</v>

2729
02:08:46.510 --> 02:08:47.410
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when,</v>

2730
02:08:47.411 --> 02:08:51.430
<v Speaker 1>when antlers clash and deer and elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kill each other all the time.</v>

2731
02:08:51.431 --> 02:08:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stumbled upon heck yeah,</v>

2732

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2733
02:08:54.610 --> 02:08:57.850
<v Speaker 1>All of the thought of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's every year program.</v>

2734
02:08:58.090 --> 02:09:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Every year in Iowa on the different</v>
<v Speaker 1>farms that I hunt,</v>

2735
02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:06.120
<v Speaker 1>I find either two bucks that are locked</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and dead or a buck that's dead</v>

2736
02:09:08.130 --> 02:09:10.370
<v Speaker 1>kind of based on a puncture room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2737
02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:13.210
<v Speaker 1>They fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that we were actually,</v>

2738
02:09:13.211 --> 02:09:15.730
<v Speaker 1>when we were at that to hone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about some of the elk that</v>

2739
02:09:15.790 --> 02:09:20.790
<v Speaker 1>people took last year and the manager</v>
<v Speaker 1>said that one of the bowls they took was</v>

2740
02:09:21.791 --> 02:09:26.080
<v Speaker 1>because of the fact he had broke his</v>
<v Speaker 1>horn at one time and he grew that spear</v>

2741
02:09:26.081 --> 02:09:30.910
<v Speaker 1>out of the front and they said he kept</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing other elk because he,</v>

2742
02:09:30.970 --> 02:09:35.650
<v Speaker 1>when he would fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he literally had this broad sword where</v>

2743
02:09:35.651 --> 02:09:37.960
<v Speaker 1>everything else had this like steel</v>
<v Speaker 1>mace,</v>

2744
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:38.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2745
02:09:38.630 --> 02:09:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Everything else would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would co connect almost like people</v>

2746
02:09:41.411 --> 02:09:45.790
<v Speaker 1>like locking their hands to write and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>game of mercy and one guy had a fricking</v>

2747
02:09:46.140 --> 02:09:49.930
<v Speaker 1>wolverines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a terminator two Frickin sword on</v>

2748
02:09:49.931 --> 02:09:51.250
<v Speaker 1>his arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had,</v>

2749
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:52.870
<v Speaker 1>it was ridiculous and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2750
02:09:52.871 --> 02:09:56.680
<v Speaker 1>we gotta drop t2.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a fascinating thing that these</v>

2751
02:09:56.681 --> 02:10:01.040
<v Speaker 1>animals develop weapons every year and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they collide with each other and smash</v>

2752
02:10:01.041 --> 02:10:03.640
<v Speaker 1>each other in the head and then they go</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to normal.</v>

2753
02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Like nothing ever happened.</v>

2754
02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:09.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot like guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about this.</v>

2755
02:10:09.730 --> 02:10:10.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

2756
02:10:10.570 --> 02:10:12.910
<v Speaker 1>if we could only do it once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where would you go?</v>

2757
02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:17.740
<v Speaker 1>If the quickening happened once a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and every once a year everybody started</v>

2758
02:10:17.741 --> 02:10:20.650
<v Speaker 1>getting crazy and horny and dude's</v>
<v Speaker 1>running red lights and he's breaking</v>

2759
02:10:20.651 --> 02:10:22.220
<v Speaker 1>into people's houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go to,</v>

2760
02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:25.780
<v Speaker 1>I'd go to my house and I locked the door</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

2761
02:10:25.781 --> 02:10:26.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've gotta be,</v>

2762
02:10:26.770 --> 02:10:28.630
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be able to stay awake because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if deere,</v>

2763
02:10:28.631 --> 02:10:30.370
<v Speaker 1>we'll let people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people know how to open doors.</v>

2764
02:10:30.371 --> 02:10:32.410
<v Speaker 1>I have to stay awake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay awake,</v>

2765
02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:34.070
<v Speaker 1>you gotta I could stay away.</v>

2766
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:36.860
<v Speaker 5>You got to put like metal all around the</v>
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>

2767
02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:39.440
<v Speaker 5>You gotta have all your friends over and</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody has guns.</v>

2768
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:42.920
<v Speaker 5>You gotta you gotta keep an eye out for</v>
<v Speaker 5>the outside they would call it the</v>

2769
02:10:42.921 --> 02:10:47.921
<v Speaker 5>fucking people just couldn't help like</v>
<v Speaker 5>for for three or four days out of every</v>

2770
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:50.450
<v Speaker 5>year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody just loses their mind</v>

2771
02:10:50.451 --> 02:10:53.030
<v Speaker 5>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be the equivalent to what</v>

2772
02:10:53.031 --> 02:10:54.950
<v Speaker 5>happens to animals when they were in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rut.</v>

2773
02:10:55.070 --> 02:10:58.910
<v Speaker 5>Like we'd be talking about finding that</v>
<v Speaker 5>more dough and all those men were just</v>

2774
02:10:59.150 --> 02:11:02.030
<v Speaker 5>jumping her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's at the purge that you wouldn't be</v>

2775
02:11:02.031 --> 02:11:05.720
<v Speaker 5>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean the quickening is not that.</v>

2776
02:11:05.721 --> 02:11:08.800
<v Speaker 5>It is a quickening just made him not the</v>
<v Speaker 5>quick a's.</v>

2777
02:11:08.810 --> 02:11:10.460
<v Speaker 5>A weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the ones that are,</v>

2778
02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:13.190
<v Speaker 5>it's the idea that art bill always</v>
<v Speaker 5>brought up on that show.</v>

2779
02:11:13.191 --> 02:11:14.870
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever listen to the art bell radio</v>
<v Speaker 5>show?</v>

2780
02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:19.250
<v Speaker 5>He's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's the best art bell was like this.</v>

2781
02:11:19.251 --> 02:11:24.251
<v Speaker 5>A late night</v>
<v Speaker 5>radio hosts a legendary late night radio</v>

2782
02:11:24.561 --> 02:11:27.740
<v Speaker 5>hosts that always entertained all these</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

2783
02:11:27.770 --> 02:11:31.520
<v Speaker 5>He had these people on the show that</v>
<v Speaker 5>were psychics or they were big foot</v>

2784
02:11:31.521 --> 02:11:32.331
<v Speaker 5>experts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are they,</v>

2785
02:11:32.331 --> 02:11:35.720
<v Speaker 5>were they worked at [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 5>experience 2015.</v>

2786
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:37.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in many ways.</v>

2787
02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:40.370
<v Speaker 5>In many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I owe it to art bell and I did his show</v>

2788
02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:42.980
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I did his show was a huge honor for</v>

2789
02:11:42.981 --> 02:11:43.461
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2790
02:11:43.461 --> 02:11:44.990
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are mad.</v>

2791
02:11:45.050 --> 02:11:46.490
<v Speaker 5>So it was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were said that I,</v>

2792
02:11:46.491 --> 02:11:49.280
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was some Ufo researchers got pissed</v>

2793
02:11:49.281 --> 02:11:51.900
<v Speaker 5>off at me because I was saying that most</v>
<v Speaker 5>of what you see,</v>

2794
02:11:51.901 --> 02:11:54.290
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm still intrigued by the idea of alien</v>

2795
02:11:54.291 --> 02:11:57.520
<v Speaker 5>life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think I'm done with that in that</v>

2796
02:11:57.530 --> 02:12:00.860
<v Speaker 5>what we're dealing with is a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are full shit and they're</v>

2797
02:12:00.861 --> 02:12:04.760
<v Speaker 5>making things up and that's what's going</v>
<v Speaker 5>on and there's a lot of like these,</v>

2798
02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:07.400
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these images that people doctor up.</v>

2799
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:10.660
<v Speaker 5>Then it gets proven their doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they get into the mindset.</v>

2800
02:12:10.670 --> 02:12:14.140
<v Speaker 5>They get into the Zeitgeists of these</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that believe in Ufo isn't,</v>

2801
02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:16.190
<v Speaker 5>it becomes something that you wrote and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was there.</v>

2802
02:12:16.191 --> 02:12:21.191
<v Speaker 5>I used to be 100% in on an area 51 on</v>
<v Speaker 5>Roswell and Roswell.</v>

2803
02:12:21.450 --> 02:12:22.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>totally in.</v>

2804
02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:24.140
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought for sure.</v>

2805
02:12:24.141 --> 02:12:26.000
<v Speaker 5>Rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought for sure.</v>

2806
02:12:26.001 --> 02:12:31.001
<v Speaker 5>Hanger 18 in Ohio kept a Ufo that</v>
<v Speaker 5>crashed and Roswell's.</v>

2807
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:34.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was convinced in the Roswell.</v>

2808
02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:35.750
<v Speaker 5>Will you ever convinced to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie?</v>

2809
02:12:36.170 --> 02:12:37.710
<v Speaker 5>I've heard of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2810
02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:38.810
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pat?</v>

2811
02:12:38.810 --> 02:12:40.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what they say.</v>

2812
02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:42.680
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2813
02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:47.600
<v Speaker 5>Hangar 18 was in a movie that has</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible Ufo movie back in the say about</v>

2814
02:12:47.601 --> 02:12:50.360
<v Speaker 5>aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the idea was that who was the</v>

2815
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:54.050
<v Speaker 5>president during 1947 was it truman?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was truman.</v>

2816
02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:59.500
<v Speaker 5>He flew to New Mexico and then flew back</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the wreckage and they flew it in</v>

2817
02:13:01.041 --> 02:13:02.240
<v Speaker 5>two separate planes.</v>

2818
02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:04.970
<v Speaker 5>The wreckage of this aircraft history</v>
<v Speaker 5>came from another?</v>

2819
02:13:04.971 --> 02:13:06.920
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most likely not,</v>

2820
02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:09.710
<v Speaker 5>but that's probably what a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>thought it was.</v>

2821
02:13:09.711 --> 02:13:13.820
<v Speaker 5>What they think it was most likely</v>
<v Speaker 5>either crashed weather balloon or maybe</v>

2822
02:13:13.821 --> 02:13:17.240
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a Russian Zeppelin spy</v>
<v Speaker 5>something or another.</v>

2823
02:13:17.241 --> 02:13:19.240
<v Speaker 5>They don't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2824
02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:21.230
<v Speaker 5>well weather balloon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not as that plan.</v>

2825
02:13:21.250 --> 02:13:23.510
<v Speaker 5>Like one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would use these weather balloons to</v>

2826
02:13:23.511 --> 02:13:25.970
<v Speaker 5>spy on people and there was another</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing they did.</v>

2827
02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.580
<v Speaker 5>This was a really fascinating episode of</v>
<v Speaker 5>Radio Lab.</v>

2828
02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 5>I wish I could remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they the name of it</v>

2829
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:35.070
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they sent bombs in Japan,</v>

2830
02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:40.160
<v Speaker 1>sent bombs over to North America flying</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jet stream and balloons and they</v>

2831
02:13:41.041 --> 02:13:41.760
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2832
02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:46.760
<v Speaker 1>the idea was to send bombs without any</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers across the ocean riding the jet</v>

2833
02:13:47.851 --> 02:13:52.290
<v Speaker 1>stream and they would land in America</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fuck people up and some of them</v>

2834
02:13:52.291 --> 02:13:56.040
<v Speaker 1>didn't go off and people would find them</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when they would go digging around</v>

2835
02:13:56.041 --> 02:13:57.840
<v Speaker 1>for shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe some of the metal detector</v>

2836
02:13:57.841 --> 02:13:58.890
<v Speaker 1>logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2837
02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:00.180
<v Speaker 1>It's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have died.</v>

2838
02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:02.130
<v Speaker 1>They blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you let a healing,</v>

2839
02:14:02.190 --> 02:14:06.840
<v Speaker 1>which I did and like fourth grade I led</v>
<v Speaker 1>a helium balloon up with a letter on it.</v>

2840
02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it said like whoever gets is,</v>

2841
02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Johnsburg elementary school or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2842
02:14:14.930 --> 02:14:16.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please write me back.</v>

2843
02:14:16.350 --> 02:14:18.480
<v Speaker 1>And then people would get these</v>
<v Speaker 1>postcards and said,</v>

2844
02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:23.220
<v Speaker 1>all your balloon landed in Ohio or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're bleeding landon in Michigan.</v>

2845
02:14:24.060 --> 02:14:27.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's really not that far off</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematically.</v>

2846
02:14:27.001 --> 02:14:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you knew how long healing would last</v>

2847
02:14:29.671 --> 02:14:32.460
<v Speaker 1>in a balloon versus the current of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>air staying,</v>

2848
02:14:32.461 --> 02:14:34.230
<v Speaker 1>guess it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Though they didn't have the proper</v>

2849
02:14:34.231 --> 02:14:37.260
<v Speaker 1>ability to guess it right back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they did get some of them through</v>

2850
02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:40.170
<v Speaker 1>and some of them did detonate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a bunch of them went missing.</v>

2851
02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:42.100
<v Speaker 1>And people did find some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

2852
02:14:42.101 --> 02:14:43.860
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the episode is fascinating cause you</v>

2853
02:14:43.861 --> 02:14:47.070
<v Speaker 1>just think of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crazy mindset of people,</v>

2854
02:14:47.071 --> 02:14:49.380
<v Speaker 1>like one of the first things they</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out when they figured out that</v>

2855
02:14:49.381 --> 02:14:52.320
<v Speaker 1>there's wind that travels in a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable current around the world.</v>

2856
02:14:52.680 --> 02:14:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we fly something up there and</v>

2857
02:14:54.481 --> 02:14:57.480
<v Speaker 1>drop it on the bullet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it predictable though?</v>

2858
02:14:57.690 --> 02:15:02.250
<v Speaker 1>It is because it's a competitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage in the game of war.</v>

2859
02:15:02.380 --> 02:15:04.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the war in a lot of ways becomes a</v>

2860
02:15:04.981 --> 02:15:05.510
<v Speaker 1>game buddy.</v>

2861
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Rest of us has got the advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2862
02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:11.490
<v Speaker 1>In that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But obviously not,</v>

2863
02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:16.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons military was 75% first.</v>

2864
02:15:17.130 --> 02:15:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2865
02:15:18.150 --> 02:15:20.380
<v Speaker 1>They could get to us quicker with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>jet stream,</v>

2866
02:15:20.381 --> 02:15:21.780
<v Speaker 1>but nobody's using the jet stream</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2867
02:15:21.781 --> 02:15:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean they had a brief window to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicking on the Internet.</v>

2868
02:15:23.791 --> 02:15:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Now will they use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're going to use missiles,</v>

2869
02:15:27.070 --> 02:15:29.190
<v Speaker 1>they're those like that's what scares</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2870
02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody's worried about Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about North Korea?</v>

2871
02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Don't they have missiles now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that Kinda Kinda crazy?</v>

2872
02:15:34.130 --> 02:15:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he just killed his half brother</v>
<v Speaker 1>show glee,</v>

2873
02:15:37.530 --> 02:15:41.580
<v Speaker 1>intimate one missile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were really excited when one got</v>

2874
02:15:41.581 --> 02:15:42.900
<v Speaker 1>off the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

2875
02:15:42.901 --> 02:15:45.360
<v Speaker 1>if North Korea was made out of diamonds</v>
<v Speaker 1>that right,</v>

2876
02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:47.820
<v Speaker 1>weren't they really excited when one</v>
<v Speaker 1>went up?</v>

2877
02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:53.120
<v Speaker 1>I think they fired one recently and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>went towards Japan and they were really</v>

2878
02:15:53.730 --> 02:15:58.730
<v Speaker 1>super pumps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's 2017 and they got one to Japan.</v>

2879
02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:02.190
<v Speaker 1>There's just letting bitches know he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's ready.</v>

2880
02:16:02.191 --> 02:16:04.560
<v Speaker 1>He's ready to launch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But could you imagine if that place has</v>

2881
02:16:04.561 --> 02:16:06.690
<v Speaker 1>made out of diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how quick would be in there and fucking</v>

2882
02:16:06.691 --> 02:16:08.010
<v Speaker 1>everybody up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>

2883
02:16:08.011 --> 02:16:09.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gotta protect the world you don't</v>

2884
02:16:09.481 --> 02:16:11.220
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these oil,</v>

2885
02:16:11.550 --> 02:16:12.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil's good,</v>

2886
02:16:12.841 --> 02:16:15.060
<v Speaker 1>but diamonds are better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get a whole country filled with</v>

2887
02:16:15.061 --> 02:16:17.070
<v Speaker 1>diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to get those two beers people</v>

2888
02:16:17.071 --> 02:16:20.340
<v Speaker 1>on it about broadheads good broadhead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not worth nearly as much as</v>

2889
02:16:20.341 --> 02:16:24.060
<v Speaker 1>diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea missile explodes within</v>

2890
02:16:24.061 --> 02:16:26.520
<v Speaker 1>seconds of launch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>US says that's what they would say.</v>

2891
02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say Yeah,</v>

2892
02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:30.640
<v Speaker 1>that bitch just blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker.</v>

2893
02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Probably like everyone at an outdoor</v>
<v Speaker 1>theater watching it and they probably</v>

2894
02:16:35.951 --> 02:16:38.380
<v Speaker 1>are required to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have imagined that.</v>

2895
02:16:38.381 --> 02:16:40.960
<v Speaker 1>That would be fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet that's what the one in that</v>

2896
02:16:40.961 --> 02:16:43.300
<v Speaker 1>picture was that a Chrysler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get what they can get.</v>

2897
02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:46.060
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a North Korea creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chrysler Caravan.</v>

2898
02:16:46.270 --> 02:16:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Who makes that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a North Korea for</v>

2899
02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:49.030
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

2900
02:16:49.060 --> 02:16:51.750
<v Speaker 1>is that a rabbit or I can't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize it.</v>

2901
02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:54.700
<v Speaker 1>That is to make their own cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2902
02:16:55.420 --> 02:16:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2903
02:16:57.160 --> 02:17:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Korean missile launcher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not even legit.</v>

2904
02:17:01.270 --> 02:17:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2905
02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:04.420
<v Speaker 1>What website is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>NPR.</v>

2906
02:17:04.780 --> 02:17:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you he's right.</v>

2907
02:17:06.430 --> 02:17:08.320
<v Speaker 1>That's a Scud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>

2908
02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says people.</v>

2909
02:17:10.151 --> 02:17:12.010
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People with news footage of her missile</v>

2910
02:17:12.011 --> 02:17:14.200
<v Speaker 1>launch outside the main railway station</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2911
02:17:14.230 --> 02:17:16.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is just what they're shitty</v>

2912
02:17:16.271 --> 02:17:19.030
<v Speaker 1>design looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea missile test failed just</v>

2913
02:17:19.031 --> 02:17:21.820
<v Speaker 1>moments after launch Wednesday according</v>
<v Speaker 1>to us and South Korea.</v>

2914
02:17:21.821 --> 02:17:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they reproduced a Scud md bucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just been an old picture they used</v>

2915
02:17:25.811 --> 02:17:30.430
<v Speaker 1>to use for my wife's bunking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would npr do that?</v>

2916
02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Cause it just happened today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have an updated picture of</v>

2917
02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:36.640

02:19:46.220 --> 02:19:47.810
<v Speaker 5>It's all right man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody gets drunk.</v>

2963
02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:48.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm down with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll say</v>

2964
02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:51.420
<v Speaker 5>is how</v>

2965
02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:53.980
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got bombed and then called me out on</v>

2966
02:19:53.981 --> 02:19:54.450
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>

2967
02:19:54.450 --> 02:19:54.901
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2968
02:19:54.901 --> 02:19:57.060
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's been very important to me,</v>

2969
02:19:57.061 --> 02:19:58.770
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It helped me a lot tremendously.</v>

2970
02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:01.350
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's cool that you put all</v>
<v Speaker 5>that stuff online.</v>

2971
02:20:01.380 --> 02:20:03.690
<v Speaker 5>So recovery just telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2972
02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:06.270
<v Speaker 5>podcasting is about conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2973
02:20:06.810 --> 02:20:10.410
<v Speaker 5>It's about just talk and occasionally</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to figure out who wins a fight.</v>

2974
02:20:10.411 --> 02:20:13.860
<v Speaker 5>Short face bear or one of them bears in</v>
<v Speaker 5>West Hollywood.</v>

2975
02:20:14.040 --> 02:20:17.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm thankful you listen to my podcast</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure do I do and I think,</v>

2976
02:20:17.911 --> 02:20:20.040
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like people that are really interested</v>

2977
02:20:20.041 --> 02:20:22.390
<v Speaker 5>in archery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's this rapper going to try it</v>

2978
02:20:22.410 --> 02:20:23.880
<v Speaker 5>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can get down the rabbit hole,</v>

2979
02:20:24.060 --> 02:20:26.910
<v Speaker 5>please try it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Try to find a good shop near you and</v>

2980
02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:29.100
<v Speaker 5>theirs because of John Lott,</v>
<v Speaker 5>other people.</v>

2981
02:20:29.310 --> 02:20:33.780
<v Speaker 5>There's just some great resources online</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you can find out a lot about the art</v>

2982
02:20:33.781 --> 02:20:36.510
<v Speaker 5>of archery Zen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The book of archery is what you</v>

2983
02:20:36.511 --> 02:20:37.420
<v Speaker 5>recommended.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That book to me.</v>

2984
02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:39.180
<v Speaker 5>Thought it was really interesting your</v>
<v Speaker 5>take on it too.</v>

2985
02:20:39.420 --> 02:20:43.800
<v Speaker 5>Like it seems like a guy who's not</v>
<v Speaker 5>totally there,</v>

2986
02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:46.350
<v Speaker 5>but he's talking about it and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he gets it.</v>

2987
02:20:46.500 --> 02:20:48.840
<v Speaker 5>But you didn't think it was written by</v>
<v Speaker 5>an elite archer.</v>

2988
02:20:49.390 --> 02:20:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that so fast.</v>

2989
02:20:51.401 --> 02:20:53.380
<v Speaker 3>And it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I read that book,</v>

2990
02:20:53.410 --> 02:20:56.320
<v Speaker 3>because I listened to my first gre</v>
<v Speaker 3>Podcast,</v>

2991
02:20:56.410 --> 02:20:58.740
<v Speaker 3>I read that book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2992
02:20:58.930 --> 02:21:03.400
<v Speaker 3>in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which actually youth member I laughed</v>

2993
02:21:03.550 --> 02:21:06.340
<v Speaker 3>like the same day you were coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

2994
02:21:06.430 --> 02:21:08.080
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was crazy.</v>

2995
02:21:08.081 --> 02:21:10.930
<v Speaker 3>And I read that book and then I told you</v>
<v Speaker 3>what my thoughts were on it.</v>

2996
02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:15.960
<v Speaker 3>And certain parts of it are really cool</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's certain parts of it that</v>

2997
02:21:15.971 --> 02:21:20.971
<v Speaker 3>I can relate to for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just like anything with yoga or</v>

2998
02:21:21.641 --> 02:21:23.560
<v Speaker 3>meditation or anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2999
02:21:23.620 --> 02:21:25.320
<v Speaker 3>it's all state of the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3000
02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:30.440
<v Speaker 5>So it's also in a language that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>extremely complex and I don't think it's</v>

3001
02:21:31.711 --> 02:21:35.050
<v Speaker 5>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think their interpretations of</v>

3002
02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:38.490
<v Speaker 5>what we call things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it matches up with the way</v>

3003
02:21:38.491 --> 02:21:41.700
<v Speaker 5>they feel about things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when you translate something from</v>

3004
02:21:41.701 --> 02:21:44.550
<v Speaker 5>Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially Japanese from I think it was</v>

3005
02:21:44.551 --> 02:21:48.180
<v Speaker 5>the 14 hundreds yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When Miyamoto Musashi wrote the Big Book</v>

3006
02:21:48.181 --> 02:21:51.450
<v Speaker 5>of five rings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you translate from that to today.</v>

3007
02:21:52.200 --> 02:21:54.120
<v Speaker 5>I think you miss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're missing a lot.</v>

3008
02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:56.820
<v Speaker 5>You're also missing the reality of their</v>
<v Speaker 5>life,</v>

3009
02:21:56.821 --> 02:22:00.630
<v Speaker 5>the feudal life and death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could agree with that reality of sword</v>

3010
02:22:00.631 --> 02:22:03.120
<v Speaker 5>fights and that there's an intensity to</v>
<v Speaker 5>their existence.</v>

3011
02:22:03.121 --> 02:22:06.690
<v Speaker 5>That I think is very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very difficult for us to quantify today</v>

3012
02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:10.860
<v Speaker 5>and that book is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you almost have to sit down and think</v>

3013
02:22:10.861 --> 02:22:13.800
<v Speaker 5>for a long time before you open that</v>
<v Speaker 5>book.</v>

3014
02:22:14.100 --> 02:22:16.800
<v Speaker 5>You've got to put yourself and don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>just read the words,</v>

3015
02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:22.040
<v Speaker 5>read the words and imagine that this is</v>
<v Speaker 5>an interpretation of someone's words in</v>

3016
02:22:22.411 --> 02:22:27.411
<v Speaker 5>Japanese who was maybe the greatest guy</v>
<v Speaker 5>that ever lived at fucking people up</v>

3017
02:22:27.661 --> 02:22:30.990
<v Speaker 5>with swords,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was really into calligraphy and</v>

3018
02:22:30.991 --> 02:22:35.520
<v Speaker 5>he's really into art and poetry and he</v>
<v Speaker 5>was really into meditation.</v>

3019
02:22:35.550 --> 02:22:37.830
<v Speaker 5>He was a ta and he was really in a mind</v>
<v Speaker 5>games.</v>

3020
02:22:38.130 --> 02:22:43.130
<v Speaker 5>He was a totally different kind of a of</v>
<v Speaker 5>of figure because he seemed to me in a</v>

3021
02:22:44.311 --> 02:22:48.270
<v Speaker 5>lot like when you're trying to like talk</v>
<v Speaker 5>about mastering archery or trying to</v>

3022
02:22:48.271 --> 02:22:52.980
<v Speaker 5>master Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's things that are vehicles for you</v>

3023
02:22:52.981 --> 02:22:57.660
<v Speaker 5>to try to develop your potential and</v>
<v Speaker 5>some vehicles are more extreme than</v>

3024
02:22:57.661 --> 02:22:59.520
<v Speaker 5>others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like our friend Cam Haynes selects to</v>

3025
02:22:59.521 --> 02:23:03.770
<v Speaker 5>run ultra marathons and then he wrote a</v>
<v Speaker 5>run the big foot 205 pound man,</v>

3026
02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:06.930
<v Speaker 5>205 a mile marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is insane.</v>

3027
02:23:06.990 --> 02:23:10.680
<v Speaker 5>I mean those people that pick those</v>
<v Speaker 5>paths like that,</v>

3028
02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:14.550
<v Speaker 5>what they're in some sort of strange</v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

3029
02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:19.890
<v Speaker 5>people that pick these like super</v>
<v Speaker 5>extreme pass or kind of redefining what</v>

3030
02:23:19.891 --> 02:23:21.960
<v Speaker 5>people are capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3031
02:23:22.030 --> 02:23:27.030
<v Speaker 5>he and engaging with the most extreme</v>
<v Speaker 5>aspects of life there.</v>

3032
02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:30.540
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they turned life up to 10 and</v>

3033
02:23:30.541 --> 02:23:32.970
<v Speaker 5>then regular life becomes almost an</v>
<v Speaker 5>insufferable,</v>

3034
02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:34.230
<v Speaker 5>it's really fascinating.</v>

3035
02:23:34.530 --> 02:23:35.950
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like with me archery,</v>

3036
02:23:35.960 --> 02:23:39.560
<v Speaker 4>it'd be 10 which most people can't even</v>
<v Speaker 4>relate to that,</v>

3037
02:23:39.980 --> 02:23:40.800
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3038
02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:42.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most people have a hard time finding</v>

3039
02:23:42.721 --> 02:23:44.520
<v Speaker 5>anything that they really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really sync up with.</v>

3040
02:23:44.521 --> 02:23:47.760
<v Speaker 5>But what I think is that when you see a</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy like,</v>

3041
02:23:48.570 --> 02:23:49.151
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>

3042
02:23:49.151 --> 02:23:54.151
<v Speaker 5>a super athlete like mighty mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you see a fully dedicated super</v>

3043
02:23:54.181 --> 02:23:55.530
<v Speaker 5>athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you see,</v>

3044
02:23:55.531 --> 02:23:57.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a lot of consequences to</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3045
02:23:57.121 --> 02:24:01.680
<v Speaker 5>Mighty mouse does extreme consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then you go one more level.</v>

3046
02:24:01.830 --> 02:24:03.900
<v Speaker 5>And that sword fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean these,</v>

3047
02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:06.780
<v Speaker 5>these fucking people that live in feudal</v>
<v Speaker 5>Japan,</v>

3048
02:24:06.781 --> 02:24:07.800
<v Speaker 5>the Rowan's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would,</v>

3049
02:24:08.220 --> 02:24:13.220
<v Speaker 5>he killed 60 something people with</v>
<v Speaker 5>swords and one on one.</v>

3050
02:24:13.351 --> 02:24:15.840
<v Speaker 5>You looking at each other and just</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking chopping people up.</v>

3051
02:24:15.950 --> 02:24:19.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like mayweather's is may win a 39 and</v>

3052
02:24:19.071 --> 02:24:24.071
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] 49 and now 49 and 49 and now</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine them being that guy.</v>

3053
02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:26.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's another level,</v>

3054
02:24:26.331 --> 02:24:29.300
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>49 no in boxing and it's not up to a</v>

3055
02:24:29.301 --> 02:24:31.820
<v Speaker 4>judge that's up to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sword.</v>

3056
02:24:31.910 --> 02:24:33.110
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally different.</v>

3057
02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:34.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his style would never work.</v>

3058
02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:39.150
<v Speaker 4>So I mean Greg or work a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 4>there because you're so vulnerable.</v>

3059
02:24:39.180 --> 02:24:40.850
<v Speaker 4>Cracker or may weather.</v>

3060
02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:41.860
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we changed subjects.</v>

3061
02:24:42.190 --> 02:24:45.370
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mayweather is a way better boxer.</v>

3062
02:24:45.460 --> 02:24:47.970
<v Speaker 5>There's just no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's one of the greatest boxer,</v>

3063
02:24:47.980 --> 02:24:50.290
<v Speaker 5>if not the greatest boxer that's ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>lived.</v>

3064
02:24:50.770 --> 02:24:55.000
<v Speaker 5>And even though he's smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about a completely</v>

3065
02:24:55.001 --> 02:24:59.050
<v Speaker 5>different level of skill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a completely different level of</v>

3066
02:24:59.051 --> 02:25:02.170
<v Speaker 5>understanding of the subtle nuances of</v>
<v Speaker 5>boxing.</v>

3067
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:06.490
<v Speaker 5>But that said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>conor mcgregor is not incompetent.</v>

3068
02:25:06.850 --> 02:25:10.900
<v Speaker 5>He's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Floyd mayweather is a way better boxer,</v>

3069
02:25:11.380 --> 02:25:16.380
<v Speaker 5>but conor mcgregor is dangerous as fuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he has a really deceptive ability to</v>

3070
02:25:17.561 --> 02:25:22.300
<v Speaker 5>move in and move out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He can cover distance very quickly and</v>

3071
02:25:22.301 --> 02:25:24.070
<v Speaker 5>he can do so a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He</v>

3072
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:27.580
<v Speaker 1>can do so in a way or he might stun you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might stay on you and you might catch</v>

3073
02:25:27.581 --> 02:25:29.530
<v Speaker 1>you early and he hits really fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

3074
02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:34.980
<v Speaker 1>But if floyd can figure him out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>start using his jab and using his</v>

3075
02:25:35.471 --> 02:25:36.191
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

3076
02:25:36.191 --> 02:25:38.810
<v Speaker 1>floyd has traditionally had problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>with south paws,</v>

3077
02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:41.200
<v Speaker 1>but he's never lost one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still,</v>

3078
02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:43.030
<v Speaker 1>and he's talking about professional</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxers.</v>

3079
02:25:43.330 --> 02:25:47.110
<v Speaker 1>You also have the bigger glove factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Con is going to be wearing bigger gloves</v>

3080
02:25:47.140 --> 02:25:50.020
<v Speaker 1>then he's ever fought in the UFC before</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC gloves or four ounces.</v>

3081
02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Most likely if I was floyd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would insist on 10 ounce gloves.</v>

3082
02:25:54.020 --> 02:25:56.630
<v Speaker 1>I would want this motherfucker to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of padding on his knuckles.</v>

3083
02:25:57.880 --> 02:25:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're going to do</v>

3084
02:25:59.051 --> 02:26:00.140
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

3085
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I think everything below one that sucker</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3086
02:26:03.220 --> 02:26:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so silly.</v>

3087
02:26:05.190 --> 02:26:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the weight that they were above</v>

3088
02:26:08.111 --> 02:26:13.111
<v Speaker 1>one 60 I think it's 10 ounces above one</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 and eight ounces below.</v>

3089
02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:16.390
<v Speaker 1>I've been where you spin to counter</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights with you.</v>

3090
02:26:16.930 --> 02:26:20.920
<v Speaker 1>He's incredible and all I can say is</v>
<v Speaker 1>when connor hits a guy,</v>

3091
02:26:21.670 --> 02:26:26.670
<v Speaker 1>their face instantly shows the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know that it was really that.</v>

3092
02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Is that fair to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know that it was really that</v>

3093
02:26:30.251 --> 02:26:33.010
<v Speaker 1>meaning that he hit so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he stunned them.</v>

3094
02:26:33.030 --> 02:26:36.220
<v Speaker 1>I think what he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm going to get hit with that</v>

3095
02:26:36.221 --> 02:26:39.010
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they actually get hit with the</v>

3096
02:26:39.011 --> 02:26:44.011
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you a person's expression reveals what</v>

3097
02:26:45.161 --> 02:26:49.150
<v Speaker 1>they actually felt and I think people</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like it's harder than what they did</v>

3098
02:26:49.151 --> 02:26:50.350
<v Speaker 1>in training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3099
02:26:50.351 --> 02:26:51.600
<v Speaker 1>you know that people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

3100
02:26:51.700 --> 02:26:52.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3101
02:26:52.241 --> 02:26:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that people could run faster</v>

3102
02:26:53.921 --> 02:26:54.641
<v Speaker 1>than people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3103
02:26:54.641 --> 02:26:56.410
<v Speaker 1>You know there's certain people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have special gifts,</v>

3104
02:26:56.670 --> 02:26:58.900
<v Speaker 1>they have special gifts of athletic</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>

3105
02:26:59.230 --> 02:27:02.140
<v Speaker 1>and some people have in extraordinary</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

3106
02:27:02.141 --> 02:27:03.310
<v Speaker 1>gifts have power.</v>

3107
02:27:03.430 --> 02:27:05.770
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to striking and it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>make any sense,</v>

3108
02:27:05.890 --> 02:27:09.940
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen it from people where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what you think is hard and then you</v>

3109
02:27:09.941 --> 02:27:12.250
<v Speaker 1>see someone else and you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck?</v>

3110
02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a video of George Foreman</v>

3111
02:27:14.740 --> 02:27:16.360
<v Speaker 1>hitting the heavy bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3112
02:27:16.390 --> 02:27:21.390
<v Speaker 1>And George Foreman was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he had fought Ali yet.</v>

3113
02:27:23.650 --> 02:27:27.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this was before the Joe Frazier</v>

3114
02:27:27.041 --> 02:27:28.900
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My might be wrong about that,</v>

3115
02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:33.820
<v Speaker 1>but pull up George Foreman hitting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bag cause it's a really recent cliff</v>

3116
02:27:33.821 --> 02:27:36.130
<v Speaker 1>that's been going around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people have sent it to me on</v>

3117
02:27:36.250 --> 02:27:40.060
<v Speaker 1>twitter for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heavy heavy bags.</v>

3118
02:27:40.061 --> 02:27:40.721
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3119
02:27:40.721 --> 02:27:42.070
<v Speaker 1>you could see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the bag,</v>

3120
02:27:42.071 --> 02:27:43.750
<v Speaker 1>you see him it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you got to hear it.</v>

3121
02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Listen to the sound of this when he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's winding up,</v>

3122
02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:49.540
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what he's not trying to work on for</v>

3123
02:27:49.541 --> 02:27:50.650
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just work on power.</v>

3124
02:27:51.170 --> 02:27:53.900
<v Speaker 5>Look at us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>literally been picked up his feet.</v>

3125
02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:59.080
<v Speaker 5>You gotta you gotta see when they show</v>
<v Speaker 5>him really digging in c he's like</v>

3126
02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:04.660
<v Speaker 5>swinging more prodigious site.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems to me that of all the people</v>

3127
02:28:05.091 --> 02:28:07.130
<v Speaker 5>I've seen hitting a heavy bag and</v>
<v Speaker 5>cooling Sonny Liston,</v>

3128
02:28:07.610 --> 02:28:12.610
<v Speaker 5>no one ever hit it the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he would just wail these full power</v>

3129
02:28:14.481 --> 02:28:17.000
<v Speaker 5>punches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when he would fight people,</v>

3130
02:28:17.300 --> 02:28:20.630
<v Speaker 5>like when he fought Joe Frazier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he hit him with punches that you could</v>

3131
02:28:20.631 --> 02:28:22.130
<v Speaker 5>tell had an endeavor been</v>

3132
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:23.510
<v Speaker 1>hit like that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3133
02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Like George Foreman moving his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

3134
02:28:32.950 --> 02:28:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Those last two are insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his ability to single power punch was</v>

3135
02:28:38.751 --> 02:28:42.290
<v Speaker 1>so extraordinary that almost no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>could stand in front of them.</v>

3136
02:28:42.291 --> 02:28:45.260
<v Speaker 1>And we stay in that sort of a barrage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a freak athlete.</v>

3137
02:28:45.261 --> 02:28:47.540
<v Speaker 1>And those come along and when those come</v>
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>

3138
02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:50.210
<v Speaker 1>if they're smart too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they're,</v>

3139
02:28:50.211 --> 02:28:54.610
<v Speaker 1>they're really good at learning the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sport to a lot of people were trash</v>

3140
02:28:54.611 --> 02:28:56.630
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where conor mcgregor is.</v>

3141
02:28:56.631 --> 02:29:00.170
<v Speaker 1>He's a freak athlete in the sense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has this,</v>

3142
02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:01.710
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy named for Rasa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hobby hobbies,</v>

3143
02:29:01.730 --> 02:29:04.010
<v Speaker 1>one of the best trainers in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Saint Pierre,</v>

3144
02:29:04.011 --> 02:29:05.960
<v Speaker 1>his trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he calls it the touch of death.</v>

3145
02:29:06.350 --> 02:29:08.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the best way to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

3146
02:29:08.121 --> 02:29:13.100
<v Speaker 1>he'll best time I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw when he hits people with that</v>

3147
02:29:13.101 --> 02:29:16.370
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look like you watched Brock</v>

3148
02:29:16.371 --> 02:29:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Lesnar windup and crack someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I saw.</v>

3149
02:29:20.390 --> 02:29:24.530
<v Speaker 1>And then you see conor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you don't even realize the punch</v>

3150
02:29:24.531 --> 02:29:29.531
<v Speaker 1>came in and then their face is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>swelling up instantly.</v>

3151
02:29:30.051 --> 02:29:31.850
<v Speaker 1>That's like what we just saw with</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreman.</v>

3152
02:29:32.050 --> 02:29:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's extraordinary for sure.</v>

3153
02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:36.840
<v Speaker 1>The difference between that and forming</v>
<v Speaker 1>is obviously foreman has big heavyweight</v>

3154
02:29:36.860 --> 02:29:40.910
<v Speaker 1>gloves on and he's punching a bag that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy's holding and there's a lot of</v>

3155
02:29:40.911 --> 02:29:43.670
<v Speaker 1>padding between that dude in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be interesting to see someone,</v>

3156
02:29:43.671 --> 02:29:45.660
<v Speaker 1>when you see someone stand in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>form and informal,</v>

3157
02:29:45.661 --> 02:29:47.060
<v Speaker 1>we hit them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like one of the most</v>

3158
02:29:47.061 --> 02:29:49.160
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary power punchers in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't,</v>

3159
02:29:49.190 --> 02:29:52.370
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever been close to an airport</v>

3160
02:29:52.371 --> 02:29:57.080
<v Speaker 1>and you see a big like seven 57 coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and you're like,</v>

3161
02:29:57.081 --> 02:30:00.200
<v Speaker 1>is that thing going to fall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's too big to be a mom,</v>

3162
02:30:00.201 --> 02:30:01.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3163
02:30:01.190 --> 02:30:04.190
<v Speaker 1>but that's what foremens when he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>swing,</v>

3164
02:30:04.340 --> 02:30:05.450
<v Speaker 1>you would think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3165
02:30:05.451 --> 02:30:06.380
<v Speaker 1>that's not doing much.</v>

3166
02:30:06.380 --> 02:30:08.870
<v Speaker 1>And then you would just see people rankl</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3167
02:30:09.380 --> 02:30:12.290
<v Speaker 1>well he was at Swedish guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not big by today's standards.</v>

3168
02:30:12.530 --> 02:30:15.410
<v Speaker 1>I think foreman was probably only like</v>
<v Speaker 1>two 20 something back in the day.</v>

3169
02:30:15.560 --> 02:30:18.650
<v Speaker 1>See if you could pull up George Foreman</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus Joe Frazier.</v>

3170
02:30:18.890 --> 02:30:21.650
<v Speaker 1>He got way big as he got older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he came back,</v>

3171
02:30:21.651 --> 02:30:24.710
<v Speaker 1>when he was like super heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he wasn't well over 300 pounds and</v>

3172
02:30:24.711 --> 02:30:27.050
<v Speaker 1>he made his comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was like 36 years old.</v>

3173
02:30:27.230 --> 02:30:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Nobody took it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you start blasting people and then</v>

3174
02:30:30.281 --> 02:30:31.490
<v Speaker 1>after a while people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

3175
02:30:31.491 --> 02:30:33.610
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just knocked out George Clooney</v>

3176
02:30:33.650 --> 02:30:38.450
<v Speaker 1>possible for connor to look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was to 17 when he fought.</v>

3177
02:30:38.451 --> 02:30:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Joe Frazier was lighter to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look up the video.</v>

3178
02:30:41.480 --> 02:30:42.950
<v Speaker 1>It's lighter than me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3179
02:30:42.980 --> 02:30:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a UFC light heavyweight before</v>

3180
02:30:44.571 --> 02:30:46.880
<v Speaker 1>they cut weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like John Jones probably weighs more</v>

3181
02:30:46.881 --> 02:30:48.860
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kinda crazy.</v>

3182
02:30:49.010 --> 02:30:53.410
<v Speaker 1>But watch when he started connecting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a quick fight,</v>

3183
02:30:53.430 --> 02:30:55.070
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a quick fight.</v>

3184
02:30:55.071 --> 02:30:59.570
<v Speaker 1>George Foreman was fucking terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go like deep into it and you could</v>

3185
02:30:59.571 --> 02:31:03.620
<v Speaker 1>watch the pummeling he gave him on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ropes is horrendous.</v>

3186
02:31:03.670 --> 02:31:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he hit him,</v>

3187
02:31:04.791 --> 02:31:07.190
<v Speaker 1>he just shook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember this fight and he pushed him</v>

3188
02:31:07.191 --> 02:31:08.210
<v Speaker 1>off and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at,</v>

3189
02:31:08.211 --> 02:31:10.580
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like him hitting the heavy bag.</v>

3190
02:31:10.581 --> 02:31:12.770
<v Speaker 1>And the guy's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Hell Dude?</v>

3191
02:31:12.771 --> 02:31:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Look how fucking powerful foreman was</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

3192
02:31:15.711 --> 02:31:19.830
<v Speaker 1>And look at that like that opera caught</v>
<v Speaker 1>when frazier collapses.</v>

3193
02:31:19.950 --> 02:31:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3194
02:31:20.820 --> 02:31:22.740
<v Speaker 4>play that again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is insane.</v>

3195
02:31:22.890 --> 02:31:26.400
<v Speaker 4>He was just so murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You saw my God.</v>

3196
02:31:26.410 --> 02:31:29.350
<v Speaker 4>It actually shook then before he got sat</v>
<v Speaker 4>map.</v>

3197
02:31:29.400 --> 02:31:32.490
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this last uppercut here is dome.</v>

3198
02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:33.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

3199
02:31:33.631 --> 02:31:37.740
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Foreman was scary.</v>

3200
02:31:38.020 --> 02:31:40.530
<v Speaker 4>His hips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's so scary.</v>

3201
02:31:40.860 --> 02:31:43.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe Frazier took a horrible shot.</v>

3202
02:31:43.170 --> 02:31:45.000
<v Speaker 4>Now today they'd probably stop the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>

3203
02:31:45.001 --> 02:31:47.950
<v Speaker 4>I'd imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause he looked super wobbling and look</v>

3204
02:31:47.951 --> 02:31:50.060
<v Speaker 4>at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would miss out like right there.</v>

3205
02:31:50.061 --> 02:31:51.530
<v Speaker 4>They stopped the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not will.</v>

3206
02:31:51.540 --> 02:31:54.810
<v Speaker 4>It was a quick knockout man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That lady got up that look fake.</v>

3207
02:31:54.811 --> 02:31:55.880
<v Speaker 4>Almost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3208
02:31:55.890 --> 02:31:58.020
<v Speaker 4>it didn't look fake at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No Man.</v>

3209
02:31:58.021 --> 02:31:59.160
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

3210
02:31:59.250 --> 02:32:03.150
<v Speaker 4>He's wobbly cause he's central nervous</v>
<v Speaker 4>system shutoffs wildly because of what</v>

3211
02:32:03.151 --> 02:32:05.680
<v Speaker 4>he took about 30 seconds ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3212
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:08.100
<v Speaker 4>Not because of what he just took right</v>
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

3213
02:32:08.190 --> 02:32:08.491
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3214
02:32:08.491 --> 02:32:10.040
<v Speaker 4>but that was part of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was why I said they would have</v>

3215
02:32:10.041 --> 02:32:11.640
<v Speaker 4>stopped the thing on the top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3216
02:32:11.641 --> 02:32:13.350
<v Speaker 4>But it didn't look fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't look fake.</v>

3217
02:32:13.380 --> 02:32:15.540
<v Speaker 4>It was a guy who just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't say it's fake,</v>

3218
02:32:15.541 --> 02:32:20.490
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just saying we kept the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they kept the match going.</v>

3219
02:32:20.850 --> 02:32:22.690
<v Speaker 4>It didn't take much to finish it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3220
02:32:22.890 --> 02:32:24.540
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

3221
02:32:24.541 --> 02:32:26.700
<v Speaker 4>He was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

3222
02:32:26.701 --> 02:32:30.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't want it any more of these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like cinderblocks dropped on my face.</v>

3223
02:32:30.900 --> 02:32:32.340
<v Speaker 4>What was incredible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it f you know,</v>

3224
02:32:32.430 --> 02:32:33.360
<v Speaker 4>frazier had gone</v>

3225
02:32:33.500 --> 02:32:34.970
<v Speaker 5>15 rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Muhammad Ali.</v>

3226
02:32:35.150 --> 02:32:36.470
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you see that and you're like,</v>

3227
02:32:36.471 --> 02:32:38.300
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a scariest guy ever.</v>

3228
02:32:38.450 --> 02:32:41.750
<v Speaker 5>And that's why they thought that George</v>
<v Speaker 5>Foreman was going to kill Muhammad Ali.</v>

3229
02:32:41.751 --> 02:32:44.630
<v Speaker 5>It was so depressing to people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember when I was a kid,</v>

3230
02:32:45.080 --> 02:32:48.110
<v Speaker 5>my parents loved Muhammad Ali.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like one of those things that</v>

3231
02:32:48.111 --> 02:32:50.930
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the generation loved him because he</v>

3232
02:32:50.931 --> 02:32:53.260
<v Speaker 5>didn't fight in the Vietnam War and he</v>
<v Speaker 5>did.</v>

3233
02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:57.080
<v Speaker 5>He wanted to like protest against these</v>
<v Speaker 5>senseless wars and so they stripped him</v>

3234
02:32:57.081 --> 02:33:00.140
<v Speaker 5>of his title for three years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he was a different guy,</v>

3235
02:33:00.141 --> 02:33:03.470
<v Speaker 5>like he represented so much to people</v>
<v Speaker 5>back then in some,</v>

3236
02:33:03.650 --> 02:33:07.070
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when he fought George Foreman,</v>

3237
02:33:07.071 --> 02:33:10.190
<v Speaker 5>people were so terrified that he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to get beat up that hunters</v>

3238
02:33:10.340 --> 02:33:13.370
<v Speaker 5>Thompson didn't watch the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was sent to Africa to watch the</v>

3239
02:33:13.371 --> 02:33:15.740
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had tickets to be ringside at the</v>

3240
02:33:15.741 --> 02:33:17.780
<v Speaker 5>fucking fight to report for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the rolling stone.</v>

3241
02:33:17.780 --> 02:33:20.650
<v Speaker 5>You know what he did?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just fucked around and and wore a</v>

3242
02:33:20.651 --> 02:33:23.720
<v Speaker 5>Nixon mask and climbing the swimming</v>
<v Speaker 5>pool and hung out all day and drank.</v>

3243
02:33:24.320 --> 02:33:25.550
<v Speaker 5>He just did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

3244
02:33:25.551 --> 02:33:26.930
<v Speaker 5>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to go see that.</v>

3245
02:33:27.050 --> 02:33:30.990
<v Speaker 5>He was convinced that Muhammad Ali was</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to get killed and he loved Lamanzi</v>

3246
02:33:31.100 --> 02:33:33.620
<v Speaker 5>legend die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't want to say it and he missed</v>

3247
02:33:33.621 --> 02:33:38.300
<v Speaker 5>the greatest come from behind upset</v>
<v Speaker 5>victory.</v>

3248
02:33:38.330 --> 02:33:39.740
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Arguably the history,</v>

3249
02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:43.100
<v Speaker 5>the heavyweight division even bigger</v>
<v Speaker 5>than when he knocked out Sonny Liston,</v>

3250
02:33:43.101 --> 02:33:43.731
<v Speaker 5>the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the title.</v>

3251
02:33:43.731 --> 02:33:46.520
<v Speaker 5>That was a big upset because everybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>thought that Sonny Liston was just this</v>

3252
02:33:46.521 --> 02:33:49.070
<v Speaker 5>fucking killer and this young kid talked</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of shit.</v>

3253
02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:51.050
<v Speaker 5>But once sunny got ahold of him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'd be fucked.</v>

3254
02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:52.130
<v Speaker 5>But nope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

3255
02:33:52.131 --> 02:33:55.890
<v Speaker 5>He his face honor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you don't know.</v>

3256
02:33:56.300 --> 02:33:58.550
<v Speaker 5>You don't know because we'd never seen</v>
<v Speaker 5>conor box.</v>

3257
02:33:58.551 --> 02:34:01.310
<v Speaker 5>What would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe there's a way better boxer,</v>

3258
02:34:01.460 --> 02:34:04.340
<v Speaker 5>but the consequences of connor hitting</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should be greater.</v>

3259
02:34:04.341 --> 02:34:06.440
<v Speaker 5>And I say should be because I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

3260
02:34:06.441 --> 02:34:08.480
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's certainly a stronger punch or than</v>

3261
02:34:08.481 --> 02:34:09.250
<v Speaker 5>mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

3262
02:34:09.250 --> 02:34:11.600
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I would agree he has boxing gloves</v>

3263
02:34:11.601 --> 02:34:16.550
<v Speaker 5>on and know how much more of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of an effect is his punch going to have</v>

3264
02:34:16.551 --> 02:34:18.370
<v Speaker 5>when he has a giant padded glove.</v>

3265
02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:19.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

3266
02:34:19.421 --> 02:34:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I would assume there's going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>diminishing for sure out of the class.</v>

3267
02:34:24.250 --> 02:34:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure it was.</v>

3268
02:34:25.241 --> 02:34:28.630
<v Speaker 1>But how much also the ability to block</v>
<v Speaker 1>punches,</v>

3269
02:34:28.660 --> 02:34:33.660
<v Speaker 1>it's far easier to block punches when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have big gloves on because when you</v>

3270
02:34:33.881 --> 02:34:35.680
<v Speaker 1>have big gloves on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch a guy like floyd,</v>

3271
02:34:35.681 --> 02:34:37.300
<v Speaker 1>he catches his shield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3272
02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:40.870
<v Speaker 1>he catches punches and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even deflection.</v>

3273
02:34:41.050 --> 02:34:43.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It moving away with them.</v>

3274
02:34:43.151 --> 02:34:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Like he gets hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets hit and he's hopping wait on his</v>

3275
02:34:46.001 --> 02:34:48.010
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're catching the end of shots.</v>

3276
02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:50.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know conner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as,</v>

3277
02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:56.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not a UFC buff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all I can say is I've seen conor</v>

3278
02:34:58.031 --> 02:35:01.840
<v Speaker 1>mcgregor shots go in when I didn't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>know they were going there.</v>

3279
02:35:02.260 --> 02:35:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3280
02:35:03.010 --> 02:35:04.900
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a four ounce glove is lighter than an</v>

3281
02:35:04.901 --> 02:35:05.710
<v Speaker 1>eight ounce clubs.</v>

3282
02:35:05.710 --> 02:35:07.930
<v Speaker 1>The punches are not going to be as fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a 10 ounce glove,</v>

3283
02:35:08.180 --> 02:35:11.680
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely slower than it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good separation of boxing</v>

3284
02:35:11.681 --> 02:35:13.060
<v Speaker 1>versus UFC then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3285
02:35:13.061 --> 02:35:16.870
<v Speaker 1>there's also a good separation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that there's many more openings</v>

3286
02:35:16.871 --> 02:35:19.150
<v Speaker 1>when you have smaller gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have smaller gloves.</v>

3287
02:35:19.151 --> 02:35:20.920
<v Speaker 1>It's much more difficult to cover your</v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

3288
02:35:21.370 --> 02:35:25.600
<v Speaker 1>So connor has extraordinary power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got extraordinary movement and he's</v>

3289
02:35:25.601 --> 02:35:27.220
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a far bigger guy.</v>

3290
02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:29.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a big frame guy and he's strong.</v>

3291
02:35:29.561 --> 02:35:32.020
<v Speaker 1>And Young Floyd Mayweather is 40 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

3292
02:35:32.021 --> 02:35:34.030
<v Speaker 1>He's arguably the greatest boxer of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3293
02:35:34.060 --> 02:35:37.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a phenomenal craftsmen.</v>

3294
02:35:37.900 --> 02:35:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Like the way he understands the art of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting and not being hit is</v>

3295
02:35:44.110 --> 02:35:47.870
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary because he's not running</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from guys don't stand rice.</v>

3296
02:35:48.430 --> 02:35:49.263
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3297
02:35:49.270 --> 02:35:51.160
<v Speaker 1>He'll stand right in front of you and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>untouchable.</v>

3298
02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:55.660
<v Speaker 1>He's only been rocked like legitimately</v>
<v Speaker 1>rocked maybe twice or three times and</v>

3299
02:35:55.661 --> 02:35:56.890
<v Speaker 1>his whole career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3300
02:35:56.891 --> 02:36:00.130
<v Speaker 1>since he's an outstanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you took those away,</v>

3301
02:36:00.930 --> 02:36:02.800
<v Speaker 1>what if you took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you took,</v>

3302
02:36:03.460 --> 02:36:07.420
<v Speaker 1>when he got rocked versus when Diaz</v>
<v Speaker 1>choked him out,</v>

3303
02:36:08.530 --> 02:36:09.300
<v Speaker 1>do you think?</v>

3304
02:36:09.300 --> 02:36:10.750
<v Speaker 1>What do you do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about two different</v>

3305
02:36:10.751 --> 02:36:11.800
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3306
02:36:11.810 --> 02:36:16.050
<v Speaker 1>what do you think conor mcgregor got</v>
<v Speaker 1>choked out by new ideas or if he takes</v>

3307
02:36:16.060 --> 02:36:17.800
<v Speaker 1>away where they got rocked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3308
02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:22.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to when conor got hit pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard when it came back.</v>

3309
02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Versus when nate just choked him out.</v>

3310
02:36:24.671 --> 02:36:27.130
<v Speaker 1>If you eliminate nate choking them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3311
02:36:27.370 --> 02:36:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he's got the heart to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really stand through a full fight</v>

3312
02:36:31.811 --> 02:36:32.501
<v Speaker 1>with mayweather?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3313
02:36:32.501 --> 02:36:34.630
<v Speaker 1>he certainly does because he went</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a full fight with the,</v>

3314
02:36:34.631 --> 02:36:35.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Nate Diaz.</v>

3315
02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:38.260
<v Speaker 1>He won the rematch and a five round war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3316
02:36:38.350 --> 02:36:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Which was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you.</v>

3317
02:36:40.060 --> 02:36:43.990
<v Speaker 1>You can never guess like anybody who</v>
<v Speaker 1>guesses what a guy has like as far as</v>

3318
02:36:43.991 --> 02:36:45.730
<v Speaker 1>heart and determination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's foolish.</v>

3319
02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.880
<v Speaker 1>He'll show you with his actions where</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll show you with her actions.</v>

3320
02:36:49.150 --> 02:36:50.890
<v Speaker 1>You can't guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whenever people,</v>

3321
02:36:50.891 --> 02:36:52.140
<v Speaker 1>guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start saying,</v>

3322
02:36:52.330 --> 02:36:53.770
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll never be able to survive a tough</v>

3323
02:36:53.771 --> 02:36:56.470
<v Speaker 1>fight or he doesn't have the guts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you,</v>

3324
02:36:56.530 --> 02:37:01.060
<v Speaker 1>you mistake like your understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see in front of you for what's</v>

3325
02:37:01.061 --> 02:37:02.860
<v Speaker 1>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what a lot of people did with</v>

3326
02:37:02.861 --> 02:37:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad Ali versus George Foreman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people doing a lot of</v>

3327
02:37:05.591 --> 02:37:07.600
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that makes this fight</v>

3328
02:37:07.601 --> 02:37:11.200
<v Speaker 1>intriguing is we've never seen floyd box</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy like conor mcgregor and we've</v>

3329
02:37:11.201 --> 02:37:13.150
<v Speaker 1>definitely never seen conor mcgregor</v>
<v Speaker 1>box,</v>

3330
02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:15.650
<v Speaker 1>especially at a level that the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

3331
02:37:15.651 --> 02:37:16.130
<v Speaker 1>that floyd</v>

3332
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:18.830
<v Speaker 5>mayweather is at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So him coming from being a two division</v>

3333
02:37:18.831 --> 02:37:22.280
<v Speaker 5>UFC champion will help his confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He'll be scary.</v>

3334
02:37:22.490 --> 02:37:25.670
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things that he said that</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a psychological thing that no one</v>

3335
02:37:25.671 --> 02:37:27.860
<v Speaker 5>could ever say to floyd before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

3336
02:37:27.861 --> 02:37:29.630
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

3337
02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:32.030
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the only reason why this thing is fair</v>

3338
02:37:32.180 --> 02:37:34.130
<v Speaker 5>is because we're playing by books and</v>
<v Speaker 5>rules.</v>

3339
02:37:34.310 --> 02:37:36.590
<v Speaker 5>If it was a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would fucking kill him.</v>

3340
02:37:37.250 --> 02:37:39.920
<v Speaker 5>And the way you said it was like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>hundred percent accurate,</v>

3341
02:37:39.921 --> 02:37:41.120
<v Speaker 5>100% accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he,</v>

3342
02:37:41.121 --> 02:37:44.360
<v Speaker 5>but he said in saying that something no</v>
<v Speaker 5>one's ever been able to say to floyd,</v>

3343
02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:47.240
<v Speaker 5>I will fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like in Floyd's going to know that at</v>

3344
02:37:47.241 --> 02:37:50.120
<v Speaker 5>any moment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if connor wanted to just slide a little</v>

3345
02:37:50.121 --> 02:37:53.660
<v Speaker 5>bag and start kicking his face or</v>
<v Speaker 5>kicking his legs out from under him,</v>

3346
02:37:53.780 --> 02:37:55.370
<v Speaker 5>he wouldn't know what the fuck to do.</v>

3347
02:37:55.370 --> 02:37:56.900
<v Speaker 5>Do you think he knows how to block a</v>
<v Speaker 5>wheel kick?</v>

3348
02:37:57.020 --> 02:37:59.150
<v Speaker 5>He's going to get kicked in the back of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fucking head and say,</v>

3349
02:37:59.151 --> 02:38:02.380
<v Speaker 5>connor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pop the referee and then just we'll get</v>

3350
02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:04.370
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to,</v>

3351
02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:06.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he would have to get close enough to him</v>

3352
02:38:06.261 --> 02:38:08.510
<v Speaker 5>to do that and it wouldn't be as easy as</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems,</v>

3353
02:38:08.511 --> 02:38:12.050
<v Speaker 5>but the distance between punching and</v>
<v Speaker 5>kicking is pretty substantial.</v>

3354
02:38:12.170 --> 02:38:15.170
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Connor closes that distance in a really</v>

3355
02:38:15.171 --> 02:38:19.430
<v Speaker 5>fast and really spectacular way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He comes at you with Shit Front kicks to</v>

3356
02:38:19.431 --> 02:38:22.250
<v Speaker 5>the body and you're trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 5>where he's coming and what he's coming</v>

3357
02:38:22.251 --> 02:38:23.630
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very unpredictable.</v>

3358
02:38:23.900 --> 02:38:27.650
<v Speaker 5>So I think in a boxing match,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have $100 and you have to bet on</v>

3359
02:38:27.651 --> 02:38:30.650
<v Speaker 5>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the odds are going to most certainly</v>

3360
02:38:30.651 --> 02:38:33.080
<v Speaker 5>favor floyd mayweather because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>boxing match.</v>

3361
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:37.070
<v Speaker 5>It was a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be 100 million to one that</v>

3362
02:38:37.071 --> 02:38:39.140
<v Speaker 5>conor mcgregor would fuck him up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3363
02:38:39.141 --> 02:38:41.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm not exaggerating it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>putting my course,</v>

3364
02:38:41.031 --> 02:38:43.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm exaggerating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one would give you those kind of</v>

3365
02:38:43.131 --> 02:38:45.140
<v Speaker 5>odds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it would definitely be something</v>

3366
02:38:45.141 --> 02:38:47.600
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous if it was a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think?</v>

3367
02:38:47.601 --> 02:38:48.650
<v Speaker 5>Like what would it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't it be?</v>

3368
02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:52.100
<v Speaker 5>It was a fight an mma how?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't know if I had to be 100 million,</v>

3369
02:38:52.370 --> 02:38:57.370
<v Speaker 3>if I hadn't of seen conor live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I hadn't of seen counter live and how</v>

3370
02:38:58.851 --> 02:39:01.910
<v Speaker 3>people's faces looked when they got</v>
<v Speaker 3>tagged by him the first time.</v>

3371
02:39:01.940 --> 02:39:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say I would put money on me.</v>

3372
02:39:05.441 --> 02:39:09.260
<v Speaker 3>Whether based on what you just told</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone with 10 bucks to do,</v>

3373
02:39:09.470 --> 02:39:14.470
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that I've seen people get</v>
<v Speaker 3>cracked by him and I've seen their face</v>

3374
02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:16.820
<v Speaker 3>swell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3375
02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.280
<v Speaker 3>By him I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3376
02:39:19.281 --> 02:39:21.750
<v Speaker 3>I think he's going to freaking rock him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3377
02:39:21.890 --> 02:39:23.600
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people in America do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's why we're going to sell it on</v>

3378
02:39:23.601 --> 02:39:27.230
<v Speaker 5>paper view.</v>
<v Speaker 5>John Dudley pay per view coming soon.</v>

3379
02:39:27.590 --> 02:39:29.000
<v Speaker 5>Apparently they're trying to do it out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of here.</v>

3380
02:39:29.001 --> 02:39:30.830
<v Speaker 5>We got hog because before I got a</v>
<v Speaker 5>flight,</v>

3381
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:33.410
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to do it in September,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's what I heard on the Internet.</v>

3382
02:39:33.440 --> 02:39:36.650
<v Speaker 5>So I know as much as you people know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think if it does happen elk</v>

3383

<v Speaker 5>season,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3384
02:39:37.610 --> 02:39:39.800

<v Speaker 5>It's better as a problem.</v>

3385
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:40.820
<v Speaker 5>That's problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thanks sir.</v>
