1
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:03.531
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3
00:00:03.531 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested to talk to you about a bunch of things,</v>

5
00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:10.651
<v Speaker 1>but one of the big ones is this idea of effective altruism and this is something</v>

6
00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:12.190
<v Speaker 1>that you really promote to the point where,</v>

7
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.911
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is true,</v>

8
00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:13.780
<v Speaker 1>but I read this about you,</v>

9
00:00:13.781 --> 00:00:17.650
<v Speaker 1>that everything that you make over $36,000 a year,</v>

10
00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:18.484
<v Speaker 1>you donate,</v>

11
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.290
<v Speaker 1>so wow.</v>

12
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:22.990
<v Speaker 1>So everything above.</v>

14
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Technically it's having above 20,000 pounds from 2009 Oxford.</v>

15
00:00:27.311 --> 00:00:29.050
<v Speaker 1>So just with inflation,</v>

16
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.970
<v Speaker 1>cost of living changes and stuff,</v>

17
00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:32.950
<v Speaker 1>but that's about $36,000.</v>

18
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.620
<v Speaker 1>So you've just sort of decided that which is by the way,</v>

19
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.630
<v Speaker 1>the one percent for the whole world.</v>

20
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Not quite two percent.</v>

22
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

23
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll be in the top.</v>

24
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Still be in the top two percent.</v>

25
00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Even despite that it was 34,000.</v>

26
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.300
<v Speaker 1>I think 34,000 puts you in a top one percent.</v>

27
00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it's $55,000.</v>

28
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.590
<v Speaker 1>That was a changed maybe since trump's been in office,</v>

29
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

30
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

31
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.600
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is a,</v>

33
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.950
<v Speaker 1>if that's really a case,</v>

34
00:00:56.951 --> 00:00:57.371
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

35
00:00:57.371 --> 00:00:58.810
<v Speaker 1>that's a very charitable thing.</v>

36
00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

37
00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:00.100
<v Speaker 1>and it's also,</v>

38
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's most of my income over the course of my life,</v>

39
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.210
<v Speaker 1>like especially as an academic,</v>

40
00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:06.400
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to an tons though,</v>

41
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.400
<v Speaker 1>since the effective altruism blew up,</v>

42
00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:13.450
<v Speaker 1>you end up getting things like speaking fees and give all that away as well.</v>

43
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.870
<v Speaker 1>It's going to end up probably being the large majority of income,</v>

44
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:17.291
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

45
00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:17.800
<v Speaker 1>of my life.</v>

46
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever like want to buy something and be like,</v>

47
00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:20.201
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

48
00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:22.810
<v Speaker 1>if I wasn't so goddamn generous I'd be able to get this,</v>

49
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:24.004
<v Speaker 1>I never do.</v>

51
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.900
<v Speaker 1>I like basically never think that.</v>

52
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

53
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.510
<v Speaker 1>I think like this.</v>

54
00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Like I think like in contemporary society we just get bombarded with marketing</v>

55
00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>stuff all the time saying like,</v>

56
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.081
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

57
00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:37.810
<v Speaker 1>you really need this thing if you're going to have a good life.</v>

58
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.940
<v Speaker 1>And I think like an almost every case,</v>

59
00:01:39.941 --> 00:01:41.230
<v Speaker 1>that's just not true.</v>

60
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.560
<v Speaker 1>I think the psychological evidence just shows that once you go above a certain</v>

61
00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:45.430
<v Speaker 1>level of income,</v>

62
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.733
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.590
<v Speaker 1>additional money just has a very small impact on your happiness.</v>

64
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>And in my own case,</v>

65
00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.950
<v Speaker 1>like the things that make me happy,</v>

66
00:01:53.951 --> 00:01:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I like being surrounded by friends.</v>

67
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.130
<v Speaker 1>That's for the gym membership,</v>

68
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.170
<v Speaker 1>that's like $40 a month or something.</v>

69
00:01:59.171 --> 00:01:59.861
<v Speaker 1>It's not very much.</v>

70
00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:00.694
<v Speaker 1>I can afford that.</v>

71
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

72
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.500
<v Speaker 1>being able to work and you know,</v>

73
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.670
<v Speaker 1>why valium,</v>

74
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.260
<v Speaker 1>passionate about and I already have that.</v>

75
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.030
<v Speaker 1>So my life is just so good in so many ways and I feel like there's so much of a</v>

76
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:13.240
<v Speaker 1>focus on money and how money is the key to happiness and it's just,</v>

77
00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just all bullshit basically.</v>

78
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I liked that one moment,</v>

79
00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:16.571
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

80
00:02:16.571 --> 00:02:16.661
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

81
00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:19.900
<v Speaker 1>we all have these moments where we feel bad and that when that girl said that I</v>

82
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>felt better about,</v>

83
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.071
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

84
00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I was glad that I didn't go occur.</v>

85
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Did you stay friends with her?</v>

86
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

87
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not mad at her.</v>

88
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not mad at her and she had told me some sexual shit to it.</v>

89
00:02:29.981 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

90
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.180
<v Speaker 1>It was almost like the shit you told me that I didn't judge you on what kind of</v>

91
00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:35.014
<v Speaker 1>Shit?</v>

92
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.913
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

93
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.890
<v Speaker 1>she had had a fantasy.</v>

94
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I can say this because he doesn't even live in state anymore.</v>

95
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.010
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

96
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.221
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

97
00:02:42.221 --> 00:02:42.881
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say this,</v>

98
00:02:42.881 --> 00:02:43.511
<v Speaker 1>but I still saw her.</v>

99
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:44.344
<v Speaker 1>I would feel bad.</v>

100
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.370
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

101
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.780
<v Speaker 1>she had a,</v>

102
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.070
<v Speaker 1>let's just say had a,</v>

103
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.580
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>

104
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.570
<v Speaker 1>and she'd never done it,</v>

105
00:02:49.571 --> 00:02:54.571
<v Speaker 1>but she had had an animal fantasy or she had watched a video of an animal</v>

106
00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 1>fucking a woman and admitted it to her.</v>

107
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Something about it that had turned her on.</v>

108
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.641
<v Speaker 1>What kind of animal?</v>

109
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

110
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>it was a pony</v>

111
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.633
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

112
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.613
<v Speaker 2>toys</v>

113
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 2>pause.</v>

114
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.610
<v Speaker 2>It was funny.</v>

115
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>He told me that she wasn't being dirty.</v>

116
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>She was literally just talking to me about it.</v>

117
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.661
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

118
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a big fat hog.</v>

119
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

120
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I think I blurted that out.</v>

121
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>It was a dog and pony hog.</v>

122
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.511
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

123
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a famous,</v>

124
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>that's a common fantasy.</v>

125
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Women in horses,</v>

126
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.460
<v Speaker 1>a horse.</v>

127
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>His Dick is so big.</v>

128
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't think about the horse without thinking about it's Dick.</v>

129
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

130
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>When you think about a horse,</v>

131
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.750
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

132
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.960
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

133
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.010
<v Speaker 1>she'll dig on my thing.</v>

134
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.253
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

135
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a giant Dick.</v>

136
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>My horse dicks are fucking huge.</v>

137
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.150
<v Speaker 1>What a great reputation.</v>

138
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Horses are such dopes.</v>

139
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know what a great reputation.</v>

140
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 1>What was it like having him having him on here?</v>

141
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

142
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones,</v>

143
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>it was a dream come true.</v>

144
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Like sitting face to face and talk.</v>

145
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

146
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 1>I've been friends with them for a long time on that guy since 1999.</v>

147
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it was fun.</v>

148
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.061
<v Speaker 1>It was fun for me,</v>

149
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 1>but it was also something like for the longest time people thought I was</v>

150
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:12.880
<v Speaker 1>avoiding having him on for some reason and he kept saying,</v>

151
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.121
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

152
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I tried to get ahold of Joe Rogan.</v>

153
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Nevermind Tom and Tom,</v>

154
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 1>but he blows me off.</v>

155
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 1>He was always texting the wrong number.</v>

156
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>He's always like,</v>

157
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.630
<v Speaker 1>he didn't get worried.</v>

158
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Get Ahold of me that day.</v>

159
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:22.121
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

160
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:22.301
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

161
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I already have a podcast scheduled.</v>

162
00:04:23.541 --> 00:04:24.460
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it today.</v>

163
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

164
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 1>I'll be back soon when I'm back.</v>

165
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.161
<v Speaker 1>We'll figure it out.</v>

166
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Speaker 1>We'll figure it out.</v>

167
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.331
<v Speaker 1>And then it would go on.</v>

168
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I showed Joe Rogan's been avoiding me.</v>

169
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to get in there to give out this information is very important.</v>

170
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.401
<v Speaker 1>Maybe scared.</v>

171
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's been threatened.</v>

172
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 1>The government threatened him.</v>

173
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.630
<v Speaker 1>He won't open up about bigfoot.</v>

174
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 1>I believe Joe Rogan did experience bigfoot.</v>

175
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 1>He saw he was there in the woods.</v>

176
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

177
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Alex doesn't really believe in big foot.</v>

178
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:48.484
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

179
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what he's got on?</v>

180
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:52.241
<v Speaker 1>I know he believed.</v>

181
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:54.190
<v Speaker 1>He seems to believe in demons these days.</v>

182
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.581
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

183
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:25.991
<v Speaker 1>We went to a bar,</v>

210
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:26.824
<v Speaker 1>we had a couple of drinks.</v>

211
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.450
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have a great fucking time.</v>

212
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:28.931
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>

213
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 1>He's a really nice guy.</v>

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 1>He's a real nice guy.</v>

215
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 1>And he would start telling you,</v>

216
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:32.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

217
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.071
<v Speaker 1>the Barium,</v>

218
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:34.780
<v Speaker 1>they've been putting Barium in the water and you're like,</v>

219
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:35.890

220
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.953

<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you he's a great guy,</v>

224
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 1>but I understand that people are upset that he has the president's ear and maybe</v>

225
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 1>the president's like me.</v>

226
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the president just thinks he's awesome to listen to.</v>

227
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Crazy story trumps just like barium underwater sounds,</v>

228
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

229

<v Speaker 1>Interdimensional child molesters are coming in through the cigarette,</v>

230
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>smoke cigarettes with the 599 chemicals are designed to let the gates</v>

231

233
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.580
<v Speaker 3>The interdimensional child molester thing because it's like they have</v>

234
00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:13.810
<v Speaker 3>interdimensional travel capabilities and they're like immediate thing.</v>

235
00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:13.961
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

236
00:06:13.961 --> 00:06:14.920
<v Speaker 3>what do we use this for?</v>

237
00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:18.790
<v Speaker 3>I know what the kids will rape kids and other dimensions,</v>

238
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

239
00:06:19.751 --> 00:06:23.140
<v Speaker 3>like what will there always is that really the best application of that fucking</v>

240
00:06:23.141 --> 00:06:25.630
<v Speaker 3>technology and that fight.</v>

241
00:06:25.631 --> 00:06:27.910
<v Speaker 3>First thing she does right away was he against Yulia bears.</v>

242
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.400
<v Speaker 3>Covich first thing she does punch me in the nose,</v>

243
00:06:30.401 --> 00:06:31.900
<v Speaker 3>just shatters my nose blood everywhere.</v>

244
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.501
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

245
00:06:32.501 --> 00:06:32.741
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

246
00:06:32.741 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 3>This is again.</v>

247
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 3>And it was right after the Kurento fight.</v>

248
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:36.240
<v Speaker 3>So it was like I was used to losing which.</v>

249
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.410
<v Speaker 3>And you never want to get in that space of being used to losing.</v>

250
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.720
<v Speaker 3>But somehow I clicked and you know,</v>

251
00:06:40.721 --> 00:06:40.881
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

252
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:43.930
<v Speaker 3>I did pretty well in the fight and I ended up getting a mounted triangle on her</v>

253
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.040
<v Speaker 3>and finishing with strikes in between rounds.</v>

254
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.941
<v Speaker 3>Another corner,</v>

255
00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:53.440
<v Speaker 3>man put cold water in the back of my neck and I thought that I just farted.</v>

256
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.880
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a Fart,</v>

257
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.400
<v Speaker 3>but turns out,</v>

258
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.990
<v Speaker 3>and this poor girl mounted triangle,</v>

259
00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.853
<v Speaker 3>no less,</v>

260
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.810
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea of this.</v>

261
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.123
<v Speaker 3>So they grab us,</v>

262
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.781
<v Speaker 3>put us on this bus,</v>

263
00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:06.614
<v Speaker 3>I'm still in my fight,</v>

264
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.510
<v Speaker 3>it's a blood limit,</v>

265
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.730
<v Speaker 3>gloves on and they just put us on a bus separate me and Amanda Buckner from our</v>

266
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 3>corner men and everything because we'd want our fights and they take us to this</v>

267
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:17.960
<v Speaker 3>palace and I cannot remember who's pals.</v>

268
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 3>Alexander something that was in St Petersburg and it was beautiful gold damask</v>

269
00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 3>and silk and just I'm in my clothes and I'm like,</v>

270
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 3>what is that smell?</v>

271
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

272
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.040
<v Speaker 3>I'd seen a guy puking backstage because cars have a headshot.</v>

273
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.371
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

274
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 3>I must've like rolled in it or stepped into.</v>

275
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.670
<v Speaker 3>I smell so bad.</v>

276
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.730
<v Speaker 3>And John Claude van Damme randomly walks up to us.</v>

277
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:38.420

<v Speaker 3>Puke.</v>

288

289
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:56.000

<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy too because you got punched in the nose if you smelled it</v>

291
00:07:59.251 --> 00:08:01.420
<v Speaker 3>through your nose fucked up.</v>

292
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.150
<v Speaker 3>I remember being on the bus and looking around going say Miami perfume or</v>

293
00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:06.401
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

294
00:08:06.401 --> 00:08:07.770
<v Speaker 3>And people were allowed to shower.</v>

295
00:08:07.771 --> 00:08:09.060
<v Speaker 3>But I was always a swing bat.</v>

296
00:08:09.061 --> 00:08:09.301
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

297
00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 3>So I was right after put you on a bus.</v>

298
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:13.160
<v Speaker 3>Didn't tell me where I was going.</v>

299
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.890
<v Speaker 3>And that's a good way to get staff.</v>

300
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.700
<v Speaker 3>No kidding.</v>

301
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.540
<v Speaker 3>It was really gross.</v>

302
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:18.920
<v Speaker 3>I've been lucky with staff,</v>

303
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:19.810
<v Speaker 3>but yes.</v>

304
00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:21.160
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>

305
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:21.390
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

306
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.790
<v Speaker 3>I ended up going to the restroom.</v>

307
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:24.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at this shit caked all over.</v>

308
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh did I shit myself.</v>

309
00:08:27.571 --> 00:08:27.881
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>

310
00:08:27.881 --> 00:08:29.050
<v Speaker 3>it must've been in between rounds.</v>

311
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.570
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no trash can,</v>

312
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.270
<v Speaker 3>it's like silk and gold and this beautiful palace and stuff.</v>

313
00:08:34.271 --> 00:08:37.210
<v Speaker 3>So I just like take my panties off and just like roll them up and show them</v>

314
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:38.044
<v Speaker 3>behind the toilet.</v>

315
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.660
<v Speaker 3>Black Lace Thong Vladimir Putin.</v>

316
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.351
<v Speaker 3>That was mine.</v>

317
00:08:43.351 --> 00:08:43.710
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>

318
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:44.640
<v Speaker 3>I want it back.</v>

319
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:45.030
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

320
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.863
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it back.</v>

321
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:47.321
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

322
00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 3>in 2000 it was 10 years ago and it's crap.</v>

323
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:50.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

324
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.790
<v Speaker 3>So then I just go back out there and it's like Berlusconi was hitting on me and,</v>

325
00:08:53.791 --> 00:08:53.991
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

326
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 3>and like trying to pick up and he was like,</v>

327
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:55.741
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

328
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:56.760
<v Speaker 3>can I be your boyfriend tonight?</v>

329
00:08:56.761 --> 00:08:57.190
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just like,</v>

330
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

331
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 3>But he's seeing it through a translator.</v>

332
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:00.170
<v Speaker 3>So it was so and I'm like,</v>

333
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 3>I smelled like shit.</v>

334
00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 3>Like you are a dirty motherfucker</v>

335
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.070
<v Speaker 3>comes,</v>

336
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.251
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

337
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Speaker 3>puts his arm around me and I'm just like,</v>

338
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 3>this is weird as hell.</v>

339
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>

340
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 3>It was just like I shit myself in front of foreign dignitaries in another</v>

341
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.793
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

342
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 3>That's probably my favorite MMA store</v>

343
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
