00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.880
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lex.</v>

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're here man.</v>

5
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.460
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're here.</v>

6
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You brought notes.</v>

7
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.470
<v Speaker 1>You're seriously prepared when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>jumping out of a plane is best to bring </v>

8
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>a parachute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my parachute.</v>

9
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

10
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>how long have you been working in </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence?</v>

12
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.410
<v Speaker 1>My whole life I think really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I was a kid</v>

13
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.410
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to become a psychiatrist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to understand the human mind.</v>

14
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.980
<v Speaker 2>I think the human mind is the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful mystery that our entire </v>

15
00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.710
<v Speaker 2>civilization is taken on exploring </v>
<v Speaker 2>through science.</v>

16
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.710
<v Speaker 2>I think you look up at the stars and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe out there,</v>

17
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grass Tyson here.</v>

18
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.790
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful scientific journey that we're </v>

19
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.051
<v Speaker 2>taking on and exploring the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the mind to me is a bigger mystery,</v>

20
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 2>more fascinating and it's been the thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been fascinated by from the very </v>

21
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:13.061
<v Speaker 2>beginning of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just I think all of human </v>

22
00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:13.220
<v Speaker 2>civilization has been wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

23
00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:18.221
<v Speaker 2>what is in this inside this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hundred trillion connections,</v>

24
00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:22.040
<v Speaker 2>they're just firing all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somehow making the magic happen to where</v>

25
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:27.041
<v Speaker 2>you and I can look at each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make words all the fear or love life </v>

26
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:32.621
<v Speaker 2>death that happens is all because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing in here and understanding why</v>

27
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.530
<v Speaker 2>is fascinating and what I early on </v>
<v Speaker 2>understood is that one of the best ways </v>

28
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.750
<v Speaker 2>for me at least to understand the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind is to try to build it and that's </v>

29
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:51.160
<v Speaker 2>what artificial intelligence is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

30
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not enough to sort of from a </v>

31
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.350
<v Speaker 2>psychology perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to study from a psychiatry perspective,</v>

32
00:01:57.351 --> 00:02:02.351
<v Speaker 2>to investigate from the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best way to understand is to do</v>

33
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You meet almost like reverse engineering</v>

34
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 1>of brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There</v>

35
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.360
<v Speaker 2>is some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

36
00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:16.361
<v Speaker 2>Reverse engineering the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some stuff that you can't </v>

37
00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:18.800
<v Speaker 2>understand until you tried to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can hypothesize you're.</v>

38
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're both martial artists from </v>
<v Speaker 2>various directions.</v>

39
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.620
<v Speaker 2>You can hypothesize about what is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best martial art,</v>

40
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.430
<v Speaker 2>but until you get in the ring like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC did and test ideas is when you </v>

41
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:40.811
<v Speaker 2>first realize that the touch of death </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've seen some youtube videos on,</v>

42
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 2>that you perhaps cannot kill a person </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a single touch or your mind or </v>

43
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.430
<v Speaker 2>telepathy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are certain things that work,</v>

44
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.070
<v Speaker 2>wrestling works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>punching works,</v>

45
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.410
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we make it better?</v>

46
00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Can we create something like a touch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>death?</v>

47
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Can we figure out how to turn the hips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to deliver a punch in the way that </v>

48
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:11.911
<v Speaker 2>does do a significant amount of damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you at that moment when you </v>

49
00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:16.471
<v Speaker 2>start to try to do it and you face some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the people that are trying to do the </v>

50
00:03:16.471 --> 00:03:19.891
<v Speaker 2>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the scientific process and you </v>

51
00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 2>try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually begin to understand what is</v>

52
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and you begin to also </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand how little we understand.</v>

53
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like a Richard Fineman who I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>dressed after today.</v>

54
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a physicist.</v>

55
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if you're sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

56
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

57
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:37.100
<v Speaker 2>He always used to wear this exact thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I feel.</v>

58
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 2>I feel pretty bad ass wearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think you know astrophysics,</v>

59
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 2>you don't know astrophysics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

60
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said it about quantum physics.</v>

61
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Quantum physics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

62
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.480
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

63
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.440
<v Speaker 2>so he was a quantum physicist and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

64
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 2>I remember hear him talk about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding the nature of the universe</v>

65
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 2>of reality could be like an onion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know,</v>

66
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.240
<v Speaker 2>but it could be like an onion to where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

67
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:09.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're studying a layer of an onion and </v>

68
00:04:09.241 --> 00:04:09.241
<v Speaker 2>you peel it away and there's more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you keep doing it.</v>

69
00:04:09.241 --> 00:04:11.800
<v Speaker 2>And there's an infinite number of layers</v>
<v Speaker 2>with intelligence.</v>

70
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 2>There's the same kind of component to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we think we know.</v>

71
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.660
<v Speaker 2>We got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We figured out,</v>

72
00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 2>we figured out how to beat the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>world champion in chess,</v>

73
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 2>we solved intelligence and then we tried</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next thing.</v>

74
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go is really difficult to solve as a </v>

75
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.470
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you say,</v>

76
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.570
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

77
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.650
<v Speaker 2>I came up when the game of go was </v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible for artificial intelligence </v>

78
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.401
<v Speaker 2>systems to be and have now recently had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been beaten within the last like five </v>

79
00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:38.450
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

80
00:04:38.451 --> 00:04:43.451
<v Speaker 2>And the last five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of technical fascinating </v>

81
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 2>things of why that victory is </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting and important for artificial</v>

82
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It requires creativity,</v>

83
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does not.</v>

84
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.410
<v Speaker 2>It just exhibits creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the technical aspects of why Alphago </v>

85
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.910
<v Speaker 2>from Google deepmind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

86
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.410
<v Speaker 2>that was the designers and the builders </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the system.</v>

87
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:07.411
<v Speaker 2>That was the victor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did a few very interesting </v>

88
00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:11.251
<v Speaker 2>technical things where essentially you </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop a neural network.</v>

89
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.110
<v Speaker 2>This is this type of artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence system that looks at a </v>

90
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.291
<v Speaker 2>board of go as a lot of elements on it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is black and white pieces and is able to</v>

91
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 2>tell you how good is this situation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I make it better?</v>

92
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 2>And that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So chess players can do this.</v>

93
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not actually definitely with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>game of go second speak.</v>

94
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so chest to us as romanticized.</v>

95
00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:39.840
<v Speaker 2>It's the beautiful game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

96
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 2>I think that there you look at a board </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all your previous experiences,</v>

97
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.940
<v Speaker 2>all the things you've developed over </v>
<v Speaker 2>tens of years of practice and thinking </v>

98
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 2>you get this instinct of what is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right path to follow.</v>

99
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.460
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what the neural </v>
<v Speaker 2>network is doing and some of the in</v>

100
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.100
<v Speaker 3>some of the paths it has come up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>are surprising to other world champions.</v>

101
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 3>So in that sense it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

102
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:12.101
<v Speaker 3>this thing's exhibiting creativity </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's coming up with solutions </v>

103
00:06:12.101 --> 00:06:14.500
<v Speaker 3>that are something that's outside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>box.</v>

104
00:06:14.501 --> 00:06:16.240
<v Speaker 3>Thinking from the perspective of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>human,</v>

105
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.660
<v Speaker 4>when why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you differentiate between </v>

106
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:21.660
<v Speaker 4>requires creativity and exhibits </v>
<v Speaker 4>creativity?</v>

107
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 3>I think one because we don't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand what creativity is and so </v>

108
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.210
<v Speaker 3>it's almost.</v>

109
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.020
<v Speaker 3>It's on the level of concepts such as </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

110
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question which there's a lot of </v>

111
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.201
<v Speaker 3>thinking about whether creating </v>
<v Speaker 3>something intelligent requires </v>

112
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:48.621
<v Speaker 3>consciousness requires for us to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual living beings aware of our own </v>

113
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:53.601
<v Speaker 3>existence in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does doing something like building an </v>

114
00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:57.930
<v Speaker 3>autonomous vehicle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the area where I work in.</v>

115
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 3>Does that require creativity?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that even require something like </v>

116
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.410
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and self awareness?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

117
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure in La there's some degree of </v>
<v Speaker 3>creativity required to navigate traffic </v>

118
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 3>and in that sense you start to think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are there solutions that are outside of </v>

119
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.030
<v Speaker 3>the box and ai system you use to create </v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

120
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.870
<v Speaker 3>It's once you start to build it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize that to us humans,</v>

121
00:07:21.871 --> 00:07:23.880
<v Speaker 3>certain things appear at creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain things,</v>

122
00:07:23.881 --> 00:07:25.770
<v Speaker 3>dope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain things we take for granted,</v>

123
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.830
<v Speaker 3>certain things we find beautiful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain things were like,</v>

124
00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:29.250
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

125
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.760
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

126
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's creativity in different levels,</v>

127
00:07:31.811 --> 00:07:34.480
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>These creativity like to write the stand</v>

128
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.600
<v Speaker 4>with Stephen King novel that requires </v>
<v Speaker 4>creativity.</v>

129
00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:41.740
<v Speaker 4>There's something about his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's creating these stories.</v>

130
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.040
<v Speaker 4>He's giving voices to these characters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's developing these scenarios and </v>

131
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.991
<v Speaker 4>these dramatic sequences in the book </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going to get you really sucked </v>

132
00:07:51.991 --> 00:07:51.991
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

133
00:07:51.991 --> 00:07:54.100
<v Speaker 4>that's almost undeniable creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

134
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.580
<v Speaker 4>It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a.</v>

135
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:02.610
<v Speaker 4>he's imagining a world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it always set in a New </v>

136
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:02.610
<v Speaker 4>Hampshire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Massachusetts,</v>

137
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:03.650
<v Speaker 4>Maine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maine.</v>

138
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.800
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's imagining a world and imagine </v>

139
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.790
<v Speaker 4>the emotion of different levels </v>
<v Speaker 4>surrounding that world.</v>

140
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:10.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

141
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.500
<v Speaker 4>that's creative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although if you.</v>

142
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.580
<v Speaker 4>There's a few really good books,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including his own that talks about </v>

143
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:17.580
<v Speaker 4>writing a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

144
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.690
<v Speaker 4>he's got a great book on writing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's actually called on writing.</v>

145
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.770
<v Speaker 4>If there's anyone who can write a book </v>
<v Speaker 4>on writing.</v>

146
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.130
<v Speaker 4>Stephen King,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Steven Pressfield,</v>

147
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:29.410
<v Speaker 4>I hope I'm not saying the war of art and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Lore of art,</v>

148
00:08:29.411 --> 00:08:34.411
<v Speaker 4>beautiful book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I would say if from my recollection </v>

149
00:08:34.411 --> 00:08:37.300
<v Speaker 4>they don't necessarily talk about </v>
<v Speaker 4>creativity very much,</v>

150
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:42.750
<v Speaker 4>that it's really hard work of putting in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hours of every day of just grinding </v>

151
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:42.820
<v Speaker 4>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

152
00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:47.320
<v Speaker 4>pressfield talks about the muse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pressfield speaks of it almost in like a</v>

153
00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:49.960
<v Speaker 4>strange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mystical,</v>

154
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.430
<v Speaker 4>mystical sort of connection to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>unknown because he,</v>

155
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:55.650
<v Speaker 4>he almost,</v>

156
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even exactly sure if he believes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the muse,</v>

157
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.280
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

158
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.510
<v Speaker 1>I think if I could put words in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth,</v>

159
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I have met him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>

160
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.830
<v Speaker 1>He was on the podcast once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the way he treats it as if you </v>

161
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:14.720
<v Speaker 1>decide the muse is real and you show up </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day and you write as if the Muse </v>

162
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:21.381
<v Speaker 1>is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the benefits of the muse being </v>

163
00:09:21.381 --> 00:09:21.381
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

164
00:09:21.381 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not there's actually a muse </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's giving you these wonderful ideas</v>

165
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.500
<v Speaker 2>and what is the muse?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think of artificial intelligence </v>

166
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.920
<v Speaker 2>the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a quote by a Pamela,</v>

167
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.140
<v Speaker 2>a mccormick from 1979 book that I really</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

168
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she talks about the history of </v>

169
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.511
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ai began with an ancient wish to forge </v>

170
00:09:43.511 --> 00:09:44.750
<v Speaker 2>the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to me,</v>

171
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.110
<v Speaker 2>God's broadly speaking or religions </v>
<v Speaker 2>represents.</v>

172
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.760
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like the muse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It represents the limits of possibility,</v>

173
00:09:52.761 --> 00:09:57.761
<v Speaker 2>the limits of our imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's this thing that we don't quite </v>

174
00:09:57.761 --> 00:09:59.240
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the muse,</v>

175
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.360
<v Speaker 2>that is God that's us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>US chimps are very narrow in our ability</v>

176
00:10:06.681 --> 00:10:10.280
<v Speaker 2>to perceive and understand the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's clearly a much bigger,</v>

177
00:10:10.281 --> 00:10:15.281
<v Speaker 2>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mysterious world out there and God or </v>

178
00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:15.890
<v Speaker 2>the Muse represents that world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for many people,</v>

179
00:10:15.891 --> 00:10:20.891
<v Speaker 2>I think throughout history and </v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in in the past set of 100 </v>

180
00:10:20.891 --> 00:10:25.031
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence has become to </v>

181
00:10:25.031 --> 00:10:26.690
<v Speaker 2>represent that a little bit to the thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we don't understand.</v>

182
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:31.750
<v Speaker 2>And we crave for both terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we crave and creating this thing </v>

183
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:36.400
<v Speaker 2>that is greater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is able to understand the world </v>

184
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.580
<v Speaker 2>better than us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that in that sense,</v>

185
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.940
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence is the desire to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create the muse.</v>

186
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.510
<v Speaker 2>This other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this imaginary thing.</v>

187
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.050
<v Speaker 2>And I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the beautiful things,</v>

188
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.990
<v Speaker 2>if you talk about everybody from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yamashta,</v>

189
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to all the people thinking about this,</v>

190
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.490
<v Speaker 2>is that there is a mix of fear of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

191
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.560
<v Speaker 2>of that unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of creating that unknown and an </v>

192
00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.101
<v Speaker 2>excitement for it because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something in human nature that desires </v>

193
00:11:06.101 --> 00:11:07.370
<v Speaker 2>creating that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like I said,</v>

194
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.650
<v Speaker 2>creating is how you understand.</v>

195
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you initially study biology?</v>

196
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Did you study the actual development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind or what?</v>

197
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.970
<v Speaker 1>What is known about the evolution of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human mind</v>

198
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.770
<v Speaker 2>of the human mind yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my path is different as it's the same</v>

199
00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:30.771
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of computer scientists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>roboticists is we ignore biology,</v>

200
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.820
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the physiology,</v>

201
00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:40.821
<v Speaker 2>anatomy of our own bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of beliefs now that </v>

202
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:44.280
<v Speaker 2>you should really study biology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's studying neuroscience.</v>

203
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:47.400
<v Speaker 2>You should study your own brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual chemistry.</v>

204
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 2>What's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is actually how are the neurons are</v>

205
00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:55.491
<v Speaker 2>interconnected?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the different kinds of systems in </v>

206
00:11:55.491 --> 00:11:55.491
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

207
00:11:55.491 --> 00:11:57.040
<v Speaker 3>that is a little bit of a blind spot or </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a big blind spot,</v>

208
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:02.460
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I started with more philosophy </v>

209
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 3>almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's where,</v>

210
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:08.341
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think Sam Harris has last couple </v>

211
00:12:08.341 --> 00:12:12.871
<v Speaker 3>of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it started kind of thinking about </v>

212
00:12:12.871 --> 00:12:13.840
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has a back on your science,</v>

213
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.900
<v Speaker 3>but he's also a philosopher and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>started there by reading Camu and neat.</v>

214
00:12:17.901 --> 00:12:22.901
<v Speaker 3>You are dusty yefsky thinking what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is intelligence,</v>

215
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:28.270
<v Speaker 3>what is human morality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a will.</v>

216
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.600
<v Speaker 3>So all of these concepts give you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>context for which you can then start </v>

217
00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:37.570
<v Speaker 3>studying these problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I said there's a,</v>

218
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:42.010
<v Speaker 3>there's a magic that happens when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>build a robot that drives around.</v>

219
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your father.</v>

220
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.360
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not yet.</v>

221
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.060
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a creation aspect.</v>

222
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:51.280
<v Speaker 3>That's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

223
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.790
<v Speaker 3>It's for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any children at the moment,</v>

224
00:12:55.150 --> 00:13:00.150
<v Speaker 3>but the act of creating a robot where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you programmed it and it moves around </v>

225
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 3>and a sense senses the world is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a magical moment.</v>

226
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.500
<v Speaker 3>Did you see Alien Covenant is a Scifi </v>
<v Speaker 3>Movie?</v>

227
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No</v>

228
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.660
<v Speaker 1>VRC near the alien films.</v>

229
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.010
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

230
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:18.310
<v Speaker 3>so I grew up in the Soviet Union where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't watch too many movies.</v>

231
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.450
<v Speaker 3>So I need to catch up,</v>

232
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.570
<v Speaker 1>we should catch up on that one in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular because a lot of it has to do</v>

233
00:13:23.571 --> 00:13:27.170
<v Speaker 1>with artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a battle between,</v>

234
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.800
<v Speaker 1>spoiler alert to different but identical</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificially intelligent synthetic </v>

235
00:13:36.621 --> 00:13:40.850
<v Speaker 1>beings that are there to aid the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the ship.</v>

236
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.840
<v Speaker 1>One of them is very creative and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them is not.</v>

237
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.340
<v Speaker 1>And the one that is not has to save them</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the one that is.</v>

238
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Spoiler alert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to tell you who wins,</v>

239
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:53.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

240
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:58.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a really fascinating scene at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the very beginning of the movie where </v>

241
00:13:59.601 --> 00:14:04.601
<v Speaker 1>the creator of this artificially </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent being is discussing its </v>

242
00:14:05.031 --> 00:14:10.031
<v Speaker 1>existence with the being itself and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings trying to figure out who made </v>

243
00:14:10.031 --> 00:14:14.201
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's this really fascinating moment </v>

244
00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:19.420
<v Speaker 1>and this being winds up being a bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem because it possesses creativity </v>

245
00:14:21.411 --> 00:14:24.800
<v Speaker 1>and it has the ability to think for </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

246
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.760
<v Speaker 1>And May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

247
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:32.300
<v Speaker 1>they found it to be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they made a different version of it </v>

248
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.670
<v Speaker 1>which was not able to create.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the one that was not able to create </v>

249
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.391
<v Speaker 1>was much more of more of a servant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's this battle between these </v>

250
00:14:40.391 --> 00:14:44.801
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you would find it quite </v>

251
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:44.801
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good movie.</v>

252
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:46.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same kind of theme carries through a</v>

253
00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.240
<v Speaker 3>mock in 2001 space odyssey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sort of.</v>

254
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.120
<v Speaker 4>You've seen X.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

255
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.930
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So because of your.</v>

256
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.540
<v Speaker 4>I listened to your podcast and because </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of it,</v>

257
00:14:56.541 --> 00:15:01.541
<v Speaker 4>I've watched it a second time because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time I watched it and Neil </v>

258
00:15:01.541 --> 00:15:03.860
<v Speaker 4>degrasse Tyson moment where it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you said there's cut,</v>

259
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.670
<v Speaker 4>cut the cut the shit got the shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>moments for me.</v>

260
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.840
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the movie</v>

261
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.470
<v Speaker 3>winning is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything about it was a,</v>

262
00:15:14.471 --> 00:15:19.270
<v Speaker 3>I was rolling my eyes rolling your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the cut the shit moment.</v>

263
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:25.020
<v Speaker 3>So that's a general bad tendency that </v>
<v Speaker 3>liked to talk about amongst people who </v>

264
00:15:25.361 --> 00:15:30.361
<v Speaker 3>are scientists that are actually trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do stuff that trying to build the </v>

265
00:15:30.361 --> 00:15:33.610
<v Speaker 3>thing and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very tempting to roll your eyes and</v>

266
00:15:33.611 --> 00:15:37.030
<v Speaker 3>to now in a lot of aspects of artificial</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent discussion.</v>

267
00:15:37.031 --> 00:15:38.560
<v Speaker 3>So on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

268
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.860
<v Speaker 3>there's real reasons to roll your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's just.</v>

269
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:43.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>

270
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just describe it.</v>

271
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.210
<v Speaker 3>So this person in Mokena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no spoiler alerts,</v>

272
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is in the middle,</v>

273
00:15:51.581 --> 00:15:53.800
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a Jurassic Park type situation.</v>

274
00:15:53.801 --> 00:15:56.560
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like in the middle of a land </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he owns,</v>

275
00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.640
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't really know where it is not </v>

276
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.560
<v Speaker 4>established,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to fly over glaciers and </v>

277
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:03.560
<v Speaker 4>you get to this place and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>river is.</v>

278
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.751
<v Speaker 4>And he was fantastic compound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And inside this company appears to be </v>

279
00:16:07.751 --> 00:16:07.850
<v Speaker 4>working alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

280
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:08.980
<v Speaker 4>And he's like lifting</v>

281
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.120
<v Speaker 3>like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing curls,</v>

282
00:16:11.121 --> 00:16:14.750
<v Speaker 3>I think like dumbbells and a drinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavily.</v>

283
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:19.880
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything I know about science,</v>

284
00:16:19.881 --> 00:16:23.540
<v Speaker 3>everything I know about engineering is </v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't happen alone.</v>

285
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:28.570
<v Speaker 3>So the situation of a compound with no </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of engineers they're working on</v>

286
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:32.870
<v Speaker 3>this is not feasible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not feasible,</v>

287
00:16:32.871 --> 00:16:37.871
<v Speaker 3>it's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other moments like that were the</v>

288
00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:43.631
<v Speaker 3>technical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the discussion about how it's </v>

289
00:16:43.631 --> 00:16:43.900
<v Speaker 3>technically done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

290
00:16:43.901 --> 00:16:47.810
<v Speaker 3>they threw a few jargon despite stuff up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it makes,</v>

291
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.280
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

292
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:54.820
<v Speaker 4>Well that's where I am blissfully </v>
<v Speaker 4>ignorant.</v>

293
00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.130
<v Speaker 4>So I watched it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

294
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.420
<v Speaker 4>this movie's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>

295
00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.570
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know too much.</v>

296
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.820
<v Speaker 4>Not too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>

297
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.290
<v Speaker 4>that's a stupid way to think for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

298
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.640
<v Speaker 4>so once you suspend disbelief,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say okay,</v>

299
00:17:06.641 --> 00:17:07.520
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

300
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:09.700
<v Speaker 4>Those are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are not important details.</v>

301
00:17:09.701 --> 00:17:10.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is important.</v>

302
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:15.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean they could have gone to you or </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who really has knowledge in it </v>

303
00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.070
<v Speaker 4>and cleaned up those small aspects and </v>
<v Speaker 4>still kept the,</v>

304
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.080
<v Speaker 4>the theme of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

305
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.780
<v Speaker 4>They could have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they would make a different movie.</v>

306
00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:26.680
<v Speaker 4>So that's slightly different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's possible to make.</v>

307
00:17:26.681 --> 00:17:31.681
<v Speaker 4>So you look at 2001 space odyssey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you've seen that movie </v>

308
00:17:31.681 --> 00:17:35.720
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the kind of movie you will start </v>

309
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.131
<v Speaker 4>if you've talked to scientists that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll start making those kinds of </v>

310
00:17:38.131 --> 00:17:38.290
<v Speaker 4>movies because</v>

311
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.280
<v Speaker 3>you can't actually use jargon that makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense because we don't know how to build</v>

312
00:17:43.281 --> 00:17:48.281
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the way you need to film it and talk </v>

313
00:17:48.281 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 3>about it is with mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this hedgehog type</v>

314
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.070
<v Speaker 2>like you almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say very little.</v>

315
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Leave it to your imagination to see what</v>

316
00:17:55.821 --> 00:18:00.821
<v Speaker 4>happens here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything was in the open even in </v>

317
00:18:00.821 --> 00:18:02.630
<v Speaker 4>winter in terms of the actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>construction of the brain that when they</v>

318
00:18:02.631 --> 00:18:06.860
<v Speaker 4>had that foam looking whatever gel </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>

319
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.730
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

320
00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:10.430
<v Speaker 4>He said if they gave a little bit more</v>

321
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:15.840
<v Speaker 2>ms Dot suttle mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I would have enjoyed that movie </v>

322
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.511
<v Speaker 2>a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the second time really because of </v>

323
00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:18.511
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

324
00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:18.511
<v Speaker 2>I think it's your favorite Scifi.</v>

325
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.490
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely one of my favorite side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of my favorite movies,</v>

326
00:18:22.491 --> 00:18:23.690
<v Speaker 4>period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I loved it.</v>

327
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:24.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

328
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:24.930
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

329
00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:30.090
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched it again and also Sam Harris </v>

330
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.650
<v Speaker 2>said that he also hated the movie and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then washed again and liked it.</v>

331
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.980
<v Speaker 2>So I gave it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave it a chance.</v>

332
00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.500
<v Speaker 2>Why would you see a movie again after </v>
<v Speaker 2>you hate it?</v>

333
00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:44.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because maybe you're self aware enough </v>

334
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.020
<v Speaker 2>to think there's something unhealthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the way I hated the movie.</v>

335
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Like you're like introspective enough to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

336
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like I have the same experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Batman.</v>

337
00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched a which one?</v>

338
00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.830
<v Speaker 2>Dark night?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Christian Bale,</v>

339
00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Christian Bale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so to me,</v>

340
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:06.400
<v Speaker 2>the first time I watched that is a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a costume,</v>

341
00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.750
<v Speaker 2>like speaking excessively with </v>
<v Speaker 2>excessively low voice.</v>

342
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was just something with like </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bunny ears,</v>

343
00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.610
<v Speaker 2>not bunny ears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the ears.</v>

344
00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.090
<v Speaker 2>It's so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you can go back and okay,</v>

345
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:24.510
<v Speaker 2>if we just accepted those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the reality of the world we live </v>

346
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.830
<v Speaker 2>in now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the human nature aspects that are</v>

347
00:19:26.831 --> 00:19:28.540
<v Speaker 2>being explored here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>

348
00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:34.490
<v Speaker 2>the beautiful conflict between good and </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil as being explored here and what are</v>

349
00:19:35.051 --> 00:19:39.170
<v Speaker 2>the awesome graphics effects that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>being on exhibit.</v>

350
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you could just suspend that,</v>

351
00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:47.590
<v Speaker 2>that's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The movie can become quite fun to watch,</v>

352
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.070
<v Speaker 2>but still to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to offend anybody,</v>

353
00:19:51.071 --> 00:19:54.010
<v Speaker 2>but a bad superhero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Movies are difficult.</v>

354
00:19:54.011 --> 00:19:56.170
<v Speaker 2>It's still difficult for me to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

355
00:19:56.171 --> 00:20:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Who was talking about that recently?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it Kelly?</v>

356
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.430
<v Speaker 4>Kelly slater?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

357
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:03.570
<v Speaker 4>that was yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yesterday.</v>

358
00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:05.520
<v Speaker 4>Kyle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's kind of a guy.</v>

359
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.190
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't look super hero movies or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

360
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:10.140
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't like superhero movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about Batman,</v>

361
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.420
<v Speaker 4>about Christian Bale's voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

362
00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:14.940
<v Speaker 4>the most ridiculous thing was that he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually Batman.</v>

363
00:20:14.941 --> 00:20:19.941
<v Speaker 4>Not those voice on Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that part of it is way less ridiculous </v>

364
00:20:22.411 --> 00:20:25.620
<v Speaker 4>than the fact that he's Batman is Batman</v>
<v Speaker 4>because anybody could do that voice.</v>

365
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

366
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.800
<v Speaker 4>but I contradict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

367
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:34.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a hypocrite because game of thrones </v>

368
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.830
<v Speaker 4>or Tolkien's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lord of the Rings,</v>

369
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna tow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's totally believable to me.</v>

370
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

371
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.580
<v Speaker 4>Dragons and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's a fantasy world,</v>

372
00:20:44.581 --> 00:20:49.581
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem with something like </v>

373
00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:49.990
<v Speaker 4>Batman or even Mokena is that it takes </v>
<v Speaker 4>place in this world.</v>

374
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.920
<v Speaker 4>Whereas they're in middle earth are in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>place that doesn't exist.</v>

375
00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 4>And if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you like Avatar,</v>

376
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.820
<v Speaker 4>if you make a movie about a place that </v>
<v Speaker 4>does not exist,</v>

377
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.380
<v Speaker 4>you can have all kinds of crazy shit in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that movie because it's not real.</v>

378
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.510
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

379
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.380
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time,</v>

380
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.850
<v Speaker 4>like star wars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's harder for me.</v>

381
00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:16.240
<v Speaker 4>And you're saying star wars is a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>more real because it's,</v>

382
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:21.540
<v Speaker 4>it's feels feasible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he could have spaceships flying </v>

383
00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:21.540
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

384
00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.620
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's not feasible about star wars to.</v>

385
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:24.670
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>

386
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.620
<v Speaker 4>I'll leave that one to the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>undergrad size.</v>

387
00:21:26.621 --> 00:21:28.990
<v Speaker 4>He was getting angry about the robot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's circular.</v>

388
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.280
<v Speaker 4>Whatever rolls around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like slippery.</v>

389
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:37.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like trying to roll around all over the </v>

390
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:37.520
<v Speaker 4>sand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't work.</v>

391
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:37.520
<v Speaker 4>It would get no traction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

392
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:42.121
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you had like glass tires and he </v>

393
00:21:42.121 --> 00:21:42.600
<v Speaker 4>tried to drive over sand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was smooth.</v>

394
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.130
<v Speaker 4>You'd get nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

395
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:49.530
<v Speaker 4>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's actually the guy that made me </v>

396
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.631
<v Speaker 4>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the movie ghost with Patrick </v>

397
00:21:51.631 --> 00:21:51.631
<v Speaker 4>swayze and it was at this pockets or </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere.</v>

398
00:21:51.631 --> 00:21:52.990
<v Speaker 4>He was talking about the fact that.</v>

399
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.830
<v Speaker 4>So this guy could go through the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

400
00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.880
<v Speaker 4>It's a beautiful romantic movie that </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody should watch.</v>

401
00:22:00.881 --> 00:22:05.881
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he doesn't seem to fall through </v>

402
00:22:05.881 --> 00:22:07.080
<v Speaker 4>chairs when he sits on them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

403
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.140
<v Speaker 4>Say he can walk through walls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he can put his hand on the desk.</v>

404
00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:16.240
<v Speaker 4>You can sit like his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His blood has a magical shield that is </v>

405
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.480
<v Speaker 4>in this reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a quantum shield that protects </v>

406
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:21.740
<v Speaker 4>them from falling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

407
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.970
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

408
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.980
<v Speaker 4>those devices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unnecessary movies.</v>

409
00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:28.630
<v Speaker 4>I get it in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

410
00:22:28.631 --> 00:22:33.631
<v Speaker 4>But you got a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a good point to just cut the </v>

411
00:22:33.631 --> 00:22:34.750
<v Speaker 4>shit moments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have to be there.</v>

412
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:40.050
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just have to work them out in </v>

413
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.461
<v Speaker 4>advance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is a lot of movie </v>

414
00:22:41.461 --> 00:22:41.461
<v Speaker 4>producers think that they're smarter </v>
<v Speaker 4>than people.</v>

415
00:22:41.461 --> 00:22:42.940
<v Speaker 4>They just decided on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just put it in there.</v>

416
00:22:42.941 --> 00:22:44.200
<v Speaker 4>The average person is not going to care.</v>

417
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.200
<v Speaker 4>I've had that conversation with movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>producers about martial arts and I was </v>

418
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:49.200
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

419
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.140
<v Speaker 4>this is just nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that.</v>

420
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.890
<v Speaker 4>Like because I was explaining martial </v>
<v Speaker 4>arts to someone and he was like,</v>

421
00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:55.540
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the average person's not going to care.</v>

422
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:56.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

423
00:22:56.141 --> 00:22:57.820
<v Speaker 4>the average person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

424
00:22:57.821 --> 00:23:02.821
<v Speaker 4>well you brought me in as a martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 4>expert to talk to you about your movie </v>

425
00:23:02.821 --> 00:23:02.890
<v Speaker 4>and I'm telling you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is horseshit.</v>

426
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a huge believer,</v>

427
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.960
<v Speaker 4>Steve jobs philosophy where forget the </v>
<v Speaker 4>average person discussion because first </v>

428
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:13.450
<v Speaker 4>of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the average person will care.</v>

429
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:19.470
<v Speaker 4>A steve jobs designed with really push </v>
<v Speaker 4>the design of the interior of computers </v>

430
00:23:20.531 --> 00:23:23.140
<v Speaker 4>to be beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just the exterior.</v>

431
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.200
<v Speaker 4>Even if you never see it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have attention to detail,</v>

432
00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:31.201
<v Speaker 4>to every aspect of the design,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it's completely hidden from the </v>

433
00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:33.970
<v Speaker 4>actual user in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow that Karma,</v>

434
00:23:33.971 --> 00:23:38.971
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is that like love for </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything you do and that loves seeps </v>

435
00:23:38.971 --> 00:23:40.480
<v Speaker 4>through the product.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the same.</v>

436
00:23:40.481 --> 00:23:43.840
<v Speaker 4>I think with movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you talk about space,</v>

437
00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 4>the 2001 odyssey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's</v>

438
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.920
<v Speaker 2>so many details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's probably these groups of</v>

439
00:23:48.921 --> 00:23:51.250
<v Speaker 2>people that study every detail of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie and other,</v>

440
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooper films,</v>

441
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:58.930
<v Speaker 2>those little details matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somehow they all come together to show </v>

442
00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:03.050
<v Speaker 2>how deeply passionate you are about </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling the story.</v>

443
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick was a perfect example,</v>

444
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:09.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he would put layer upon layer </v>

445
00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:09.610
<v Speaker 1>upon layer of detail and the films that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people would never even recognize.</v>

446
00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a bunch of correlations </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the Apollo Moon landings and the</v>

447
00:24:13.761 --> 00:24:15.620
<v Speaker 1>shining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

448
00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:18.650
<v Speaker 1>there's like people have actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>studied it to the point where they think</v>

449
00:24:18.651 --> 00:24:23.651
<v Speaker 1>that it's some sort of a confession that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick faked the moon landing because </v>

450
00:24:23.651 --> 00:24:27.690
<v Speaker 1>it goes from the little boy having the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rocket ship on his sweater to the,</v>

451
00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:32.460
<v Speaker 1>the number of the number of the room </v>
<v Speaker 1>that things happened.</v>

452
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:37.470
<v Speaker 1>There's like a bunch of very bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections in the film that Kubrick and</v>

453
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.860
<v Speaker 1>questionably engineered because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a stupid,</v>

454
00:24:42.861 --> 00:24:44.120
<v Speaker 1>smart man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

455
00:24:44.121 --> 00:24:48.290
<v Speaker 1>he was so goddamn smart that he would do</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex mathematics for fun.</v>

456
00:24:48.291 --> 00:24:53.291
<v Speaker 1>No spare time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick was a legitimate genius and he </v>

457
00:24:55.190 --> 00:25:00.190
<v Speaker 1>engineered that sort of complexity into </v>
<v Speaker 1>his films where he didn't have cut the </v>

458
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.310
<v Speaker 1>shit moments in his movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I can recall.</v>

459
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even close.</v>

460
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.660
<v Speaker 2>This is very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

461
00:25:05.661 --> 00:25:10.661
<v Speaker 2>but that probably speaks to the reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Hollywood today that the cut the shit</v>

462
00:25:12.351 --> 00:25:15.320
<v Speaker 2>moments don't affect the bottom line of </v>
<v Speaker 2>how much the movie makes.</v>

463
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really depends on them film,</v>

464
00:25:17.211 --> 00:25:18.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

465
00:25:18.081 --> 00:25:22.520
<v Speaker 1>the cut the shit moments that Neil </v>
<v Speaker 1>degrasse Tyson found in gravity I didn't</v>

466
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:27.521
<v Speaker 1>see because I wasn't aware of what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects of gravity on a person's hair </v>

467
00:25:27.521 --> 00:25:28.130
<v Speaker 1>would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

468
00:25:28.131 --> 00:25:30.590
<v Speaker 1>he saw it and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is ridiculous.</v>

469
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:35.830
<v Speaker 1>And then there were some things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are these space station so close </v>

470
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:39.011
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just let it slide while the movie was </v>

471
00:25:39.011 --> 00:25:39.011
<v Speaker 1>playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then he went into great detail about</v>

472
00:25:39.011 --> 00:25:43.691
<v Speaker 1>how preposterous it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those base stations were that close </v>

473
00:25:43.691 --> 00:25:43.691
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to them so quickly.</v>

474
00:25:43.691 --> 00:25:47.070
<v Speaker 2>That's where the Sandra bullock and good</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking guy and George Clooney.</v>

475
00:25:47.071 --> 00:25:47.760
<v Speaker 2>George Clooney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

476
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Good looking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that.</v>

477
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.510
<v Speaker 2>Did that pass muster with that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

478
00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.750
<v Speaker 1>he tore it apart and when he tore it </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart,</v>

479
00:25:56.751 --> 00:25:58.520
<v Speaker 1>people went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get so angry at him.</v>

480
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He reads the negative comments.</v>

481
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:09.110
<v Speaker 2>I actually recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of doing a lot of work with </v>

482
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.770
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence and lecturing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and so on,</v>

483
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:15.270
<v Speaker 2>have plugged into this community of </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks that are thinking about the future</v>

484
00:26:15.271 --> 00:26:18.300
<v Speaker 2>of artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial general intelligence,</v>

485
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:23.280
<v Speaker 2>and they are very much out of the box </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinkers to where the kind of messages I</v>

486
00:26:23.281 --> 00:26:25.980
<v Speaker 2>get are our best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I let it.</v>

487
00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:31.660
<v Speaker 2>I let them kind of explore those ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>without sort of engaging to those </v>

488
00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:31.800
<v Speaker 2>discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

489
00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.210
<v Speaker 1>very complex discussion should be had </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people in person.</v>

490
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:40.690
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that when you allow </v>

491
00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:44.140
<v Speaker 1>comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just random anonymous comments to enter </v>

492
00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.610
<v Speaker 1>into your consciousness like you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking risks and you may,</v>

493
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:52.530
<v Speaker 1>you may run into a bunch of really </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant ideas that are,</v>

494
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

495
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:58.910
<v Speaker 1>coming from people that are considerate </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thought these things through or you </v>

496
00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:02.550
<v Speaker 1>might just run into a river of assholes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's entirely possible.</v>

497
00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:05.880
<v Speaker 1>And I peeked into my comments today on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

498
00:27:05.881 --> 00:27:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck?</v>

499
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I started reading a couple of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some just morons and I'm like,</v>

500
00:27:11.251 --> 00:27:12.540
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about some shit?</v>

501
00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know what the fuck they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about,</v>

502
00:27:14.161 --> 00:27:19.161
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the risk you take when you </v>

503
00:27:19.161 --> 00:27:21.891
<v Speaker 1>dive in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get people that are </v>

504
00:27:21.891 --> 00:27:23.451
<v Speaker 1>disproportionately upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get people that are </v>

505
00:27:23.451 --> 00:27:23.850
<v Speaker 1>disproportionately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

506
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:28.910
<v Speaker 1>delusional or whatever it is in regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your position on something or whether</v>

507
00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:31.560
<v Speaker 1>or not they even understand your </v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

508
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:36.620
<v Speaker 1>They'll argue something that's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrect interpretation of your </v>

509
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:36.620
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

510
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:37.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've actually,</v>

511
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:42.080
<v Speaker 2>from what I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've actually been to this podcast and</v>

512
00:27:42.081 --> 00:27:47.081
<v Speaker 2>so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good at being open minded and </v>

513
00:27:47.081 --> 00:27:49.911
<v Speaker 2>it's something I try to preach as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in ai discussions when you're talking</v>

514
00:27:50.601 --> 00:27:55.601
<v Speaker 2>about Agi and talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a difference between narrow </v>

515
00:27:55.601 --> 00:27:57.340
<v Speaker 2>ai and general artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>narrow ais,</v>

516
00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:02.650
<v Speaker 2>the kinds of things that are the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>tools that are being applied now and </v>

517
00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:07.361
<v Speaker 2>being quite effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's general ai which is a </v>

518
00:28:07.361 --> 00:28:10.451
<v Speaker 2>broad categorization of concepts that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are human level or super human level </v>

519
00:28:10.451 --> 00:28:12.500
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you talk about Agi,</v>

520
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.340
<v Speaker 2>artificial general intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's seems to be two camps of people,</v>

521
00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:21.410
<v Speaker 2>ones who are really working deep in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the camp.</v>

522
00:28:21.411 --> 00:28:26.411
<v Speaker 2>I kind of sit in and a lot of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks tend to roll their eyes and just </v>

523
00:28:26.411 --> 00:28:28.250
<v Speaker 2>not engage in any discussion of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

524
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:33.610
<v Speaker 2>The idea is saying it's really hard to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do what we're doing and it's just really</v>

525
00:28:35.211 --> 00:28:38.060
<v Speaker 2>hard to see how this becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent.</v>

526
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:41.180
<v Speaker 2>And then there's another group of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who say,</v>

527
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:46.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're being very shortsighted that </v>

528
00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:49.010
<v Speaker 2>you may not be able to do much now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the exponential,</v>

529
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:54.650
<v Speaker 2>the hard takeoff overnight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can become super intelligent and then</v>

530
00:28:54.651 --> 00:28:58.850
<v Speaker 2>it'll be too late to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the problem with those two camps,</v>

531
00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.160
<v Speaker 2>as with any camps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic republic,</v>

532
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.970
<v Speaker 2>any camps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is they don't seem to be,</v>

533
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:09.010
<v Speaker 2>seem to be talking past each other as </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to both have really interesting </v>

534
00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:13.421
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go back to the analogy of a touch</v>

535
00:29:13.431 --> 00:29:17.630
<v Speaker 2>of death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a of this idea of MMA,</v>

536
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm the,</v>

537
00:29:19.001 --> 00:29:21.590
<v Speaker 2>in this analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put myself in the UFC for a</v>

538
00:29:21.591 --> 00:29:22.910
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

539
00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.110
<v Speaker 2>in this analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

540
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ranked in the top 20.</v>

541
00:29:26.571 --> 00:29:29.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm working really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My dream is to become a world champion.</v>

542
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm training three times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really working,</v>

543
00:29:31.791 --> 00:29:36.791
<v Speaker 2>I'm an engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to build my skills up and </v>

544
00:29:36.791 --> 00:29:39.521
<v Speaker 2>then there's other folks that come along</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Steven Seagal and so on that kind </v>

545
00:29:39.521 --> 00:29:44.441
<v Speaker 2>of talk about other of martial arts or </v>
<v Speaker 2>other ideas of how you can do certain </v>

546
00:29:44.441 --> 00:29:49.141
<v Speaker 2>things and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Steven Seagal and could isn't </v>

547
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:55.080
<v Speaker 2>mine beyond to something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we really need to be open </v>

548
00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:55.080
<v Speaker 2>minded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a intro to civil.</v>

549
00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.070
<v Speaker 2>I think toxicity or somebody talks as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

550
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

551
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva thinks Steven Seagal is.</v>

552
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:11.430
<v Speaker 1>I want to put this in a respectful way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He understood so it has a wonderful </v>

553
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:16.411
<v Speaker 1>sense of humor and Anderson Silva is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very playful and he thought it would be </v>

554
00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:22.681
<v Speaker 1>hilarious if people believe that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning all of his martial arts from </v>

555
00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.250
<v Speaker 1>statistics to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

556
00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:29.280
<v Speaker 1>He also loves Steven Seagal movies </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimately so treated him with a great</v>

557
00:30:29.471 --> 00:30:34.471
<v Speaker 1>deal of respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also recognizes that Steven Seagal </v>

558
00:30:34.471 --> 00:30:37.980
<v Speaker 1>actually is a master of Ikea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though he really does understand the </v>

559
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.881
<v Speaker 1>Quito and was one of the very first </v>
<v Speaker 1>westerners that was teaching in Japan,</v>

560
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:48.240
<v Speaker 1>speaks fluent Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was teaching at a Dojo in Japan and is,</v>

561
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a legitimate master by Quito.</v>

562
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that Quito is it's,</v>

563
00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:01.420
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those martial arts that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>merit in a,</v>

564
00:31:01.421 --> 00:31:03.090
<v Speaker 1>in a vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

565
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:08.110
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a world where there's no </v>

566
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:11.160
<v Speaker 1>ncaa wrestlers or know judo players or </v>
<v Speaker 1>no Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>

567
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:15.340
<v Speaker 1>black belts or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Moitai kickboxers,</v>

568
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.830
<v Speaker 1>there might be something to that Ikea </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

569
00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:23.220
<v Speaker 1>but in the world we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those other martial arts exist and </v>

570
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.630
<v Speaker 1>we've examined all the intricacies of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand to hand combat.</v>

571
00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.120
<v Speaker 1>It falls horribly short.</v>

572
00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the point I'm trying to make.</v>

573
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:34.930
<v Speaker 2>You just said that we've investigated </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the intricacies.</v>

574
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.080
<v Speaker 2>You said all the intricacies of hand to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand combat.</v>

575
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just speaking,</v>

576
00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:44.521
<v Speaker 2>but you want to open your mind to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility that I kito has,</v>

577
00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:50.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some techniques that are effective that </v>

578
00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:50.360
<v Speaker 2>are affected.</v>

579
00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I say all you're,</v>

580
00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:54.300
<v Speaker 1>you're correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a correct way of describing </v>

581
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.020
<v Speaker 1>it because there's always new moves that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are being like,</v>

582
00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.790
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in this recent fight between Anthony</v>

583
00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Pettis and Tony Ferguson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony Ferguson actually used wing Chung </v>

584
00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:06.210
<v Speaker 1>in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

585
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:10.810
<v Speaker 1>he trapped one of Anthony Pettis his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands and hit him with an elbow.</v>

586
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:15.160
<v Speaker 1>He basically used a technique that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would use on a wing Chung dummy,</v>

587
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:20.340
<v Speaker 1>and he did it in an actual world class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts fight and I remember </v>

588
00:32:20.981 --> 00:32:22.090
<v Speaker 1>watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

589
00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.090
<v Speaker 1>go on this crazy motherfucker actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled that off because that's.</v>

590
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a technique that you just rarely </v>
<v Speaker 1>see anybody getting that proficient at </v>

591
00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.371
<v Speaker 1>it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fights in mma and Ferguson is </v>

592
00:32:35.371 --> 00:32:39.380
<v Speaker 1>extremely creative and open minded guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he figured out a way to make that </v>

593
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.820
<v Speaker 1>work in a world class fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

594
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.620
<v Speaker 1>And let me then ask you the question </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

595
00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:49.700
<v Speaker 1>There's these people who still believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>in quite a lot of them that there is </v>

596
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:49.740
<v Speaker 1>this touch of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

597
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you think it's possible to </v>

598
00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.571
<v Speaker 1>discover through this rigorous </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific process that is mma that </v>

599
00:32:58.571 --> 00:33:00.650
<v Speaker 1>started pretty recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think,</v>

600
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:05.680
<v Speaker 1>not the touch of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you think we can get a 10 x </v>

601
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:05.680
<v Speaker 1>improvement in the amount of power the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human body can,</v>

602
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.720
<v Speaker 1>can generate in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

603
00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.060
<v Speaker 1>and punching?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

604
00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:10.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly not.</v>

605
00:33:10.551 --> 00:33:15.551
<v Speaker 1>10 acts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can get incremental </v>

606
00:33:15.551 --> 00:33:17.711
<v Speaker 1>improvements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all based entirely on your </v>

607
00:33:17.711 --> 00:33:20.201
<v Speaker 1>frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a person that has very </v>

608
00:33:20.201 --> 00:33:21.020
<v Speaker 1>small hands and narrow shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of screwed.</v>

609
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:23.240
<v Speaker 1>There's not really a lot of room for </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>

610
00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:28.270
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can certainly get incremental </v>

611
00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:28.270
<v Speaker 1>improvement and your ability to generate</v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

612
00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:33.580
<v Speaker 1>but you'll never be able to generate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same kind of power as say a guy with a </v>

613
00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:38.351
<v Speaker 1>very big frame like a brock lesnar or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Derrick Lewis or um,</v>

614
00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who has.</v>

615
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:45.910
<v Speaker 1>There's like classic elements that go </v>
<v Speaker 1>with being able to generate large </v>

616
00:33:47.211 --> 00:33:50.810
<v Speaker 1>amounts of power wide shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large hands.</v>

617
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:55.930
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of characteristics of the </v>

618
00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:55.930
<v Speaker 1>human frame itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

619
00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:58.760
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even those people,</v>

620
00:33:58.761 --> 00:34:03.761
<v Speaker 1>there's only so much power you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>generate and we pretty much know how to </v>

621
00:34:03.761 --> 00:34:03.761
<v Speaker 1>do that correctly.</v>

622
00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:09.360
<v Speaker 3>So the way you're talking about as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts expert now is kind of the </v>

623
00:34:09.491 --> 00:34:14.491
<v Speaker 3>way a lot of the experts in robotics and</v>
<v Speaker 3>ai talk about ai and when the topic of </v>

624
00:34:16.121 --> 00:34:19.210
<v Speaker 3>touch of death is brought up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now the analogy is not perfect.</v>

625
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.380
<v Speaker 3>I tend to use probably too many </v>
<v Speaker 3>analogies is</v>

626
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:26.910
<v Speaker 1>we maybe know the human body butter that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know the possibility of Ai,</v>

627
00:34:26.911 --> 00:34:27.960
<v Speaker 1>I would assume so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

628
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:31.020
<v Speaker 1>He has the possibility of ai is </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically limitless.</v>

629
00:34:31.021 --> 00:34:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Once ai starts redesigning itself,</v>

630
00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:39.570
<v Speaker 3>it's not obvious that that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our imagination allows it to be true.</v>

631
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:42.130
<v Speaker 3>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm of two minds,</v>

632
00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:44.130
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

633
00:34:44.131 --> 00:34:45.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm both,</v>

634
00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:47.800
<v Speaker 3>I can hold both beliefs that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>contradictory in my mind.</v>

635
00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:52.570
<v Speaker 3>One is that idea is really far away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost bordering and bs.</v>

636
00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:57.630
<v Speaker 3>And the other is it can be there </v>
<v Speaker 3>overnight and I think you can believe </v>

637
00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:57.630
<v Speaker 3>both of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

638
00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:59.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's another,</v>

639
00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:05.340
<v Speaker 3>a quote from Barbara wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a poem I've heard on a,</v>

640
00:35:06.701 --> 00:35:11.701
<v Speaker 3>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a lecture somewhere that I really </v>

641
00:35:11.701 --> 00:35:11.701
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

642
00:35:11.701 --> 00:35:15.010
<v Speaker 3>it's from the champions of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>impossible rather than the slaves at the</v>

643
00:35:15.011 --> 00:35:17.680
<v Speaker 3>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that evolution draws his creative force.</v>

644
00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:22.810
<v Speaker 3>So I see a mosque as a representative of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the champion of the impossible.</v>

645
00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:28.680
<v Speaker 3>I see exponential growth of ai within </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next several decades as the </v>

646
00:35:28.901 --> 00:35:31.690
<v Speaker 3>impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the champions of the impossible</v>

647
00:35:31.691 --> 00:35:33.850
<v Speaker 3>that actually make the impossible </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

648
00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:35.200
<v Speaker 3>Why would a</v>

649
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:40.400
<v Speaker 1>exponential growth of AI impossible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that seems inevitable to me.</v>

650
00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:45.550
<v Speaker 3>So it's not impossible and I'm sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>using the word impossible.</v>

651
00:35:45.551 --> 00:35:47.710
<v Speaker 3>Meaning magnificent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

652
00:35:47.711 --> 00:35:49.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels very difficult.</v>

653
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:50.800
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult.</v>

654
00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:54.060
<v Speaker 3>We don't even know where to begin brand </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>

655
00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:59.130
<v Speaker 3>Like the touch of death actually feels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would see the touch of death is </v>

656
00:35:59.130 --> 00:35:59.530
<v Speaker 3>horseshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but see you're an expert.</v>

657
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they touch you in the chest,</v>

658
00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.420
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have the ability in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>body to generate</v>

659
00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:06.010
<v Speaker 3>that kind of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you know that?</v>

660
00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:08.340
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

661
00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.680
<v Speaker 3>it's never been done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We understand study notes.</v>

662
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.590
<v Speaker 3>Never Been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you know it's never been done.</v>

663
00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:17.290
<v Speaker 3>There could be someone out there with </v>
<v Speaker 3>magic that I.</v>

664
00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:19.960
<v Speaker 3>That has escaped my grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you've studied,</v>

665
00:36:19.961 --> 00:36:24.961
<v Speaker 3>you've talked about with a Graham </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hancock and you've talked about the </v>

666
00:36:24.961 --> 00:36:26.740
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was in Roman times.</v>

667
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:31.800
<v Speaker 3>There was that idea was discovered and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then it was lost because weapons and </v>

668
00:36:32.051 --> 00:36:34.910
<v Speaker 3>much more effective ways of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

669
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.920
<v Speaker 3>of delivering damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I find myself in a very </v>

670
00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.290
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable position of defending the </v>
<v Speaker 3>concept as a martial artist,</v>

671
00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:46.680
<v Speaker 3>a defining the concept of martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you study a Jujitsu and judo and </v>

672
00:36:48.011 --> 00:36:48.920
<v Speaker 3>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling</v>

673
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.890
<v Speaker 1>the hard ones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jitsu,</v>

674
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.920
<v Speaker 1>judo and wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are absolute martial arts in my </v>

675
00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:57.080
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I mean.</v>

676
00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Like if you are a guy who just has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic physique and incredible speed </v>

677
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:08.770
<v Speaker 1>and ridiculous power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just you just congergate ridiculous </v>

678
00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:10.370
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just are just a per,</v>

679
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.170
<v Speaker 1>you know who deontay wilder is?</v>

680
00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.710
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would champion the world boxer.</v>

681
00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:16.050
<v Speaker 3>He's a fee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have,</v>

682
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.150
<v Speaker 3>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tyson fury on tomorrow.</v>

683
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.530
<v Speaker 3>Two undefeated guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

684
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.930
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

685
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Deontay wilder has fantastic power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

686
00:37:26.541 --> 00:37:29.120
<v Speaker 1>he just knocks people flying across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ring.</v>

687
00:37:29.121 --> 00:37:31.640
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think deontay wilder,</v>

688
00:37:31.641 --> 00:37:36.641
<v Speaker 1>if he just came off the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he was 25 years old and no one ever </v>

689
00:37:36.641 --> 00:37:40.721
<v Speaker 1>taught them how to box it all and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just wrapped his hands up and had him </v>

690
00:37:40.721 --> 00:37:45.401
<v Speaker 1>hit a bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would be able to generate insane </v>

691
00:37:45.401 --> 00:37:45.401
<v Speaker 1>amounts of force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

692
00:37:45.401 --> 00:37:49.811
<v Speaker 1>if you're a person that really didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have much power and you had a box with </v>

693
00:37:49.811 --> 00:37:53.711
<v Speaker 1>deontay wilder and you were both the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same age and you are a person that knew </v>

694
00:37:53.711 --> 00:37:55.160
<v Speaker 1>boxing and you stood in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Deontae,</v>

695
00:37:55.400 --> 00:38:00.400
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that deontay </v>
<v Speaker 1>wilder could knock you into another </v>

696
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.731
<v Speaker 1>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he had no experience in </v>

697
00:38:03.731 --> 00:38:06.641
<v Speaker 1>boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he just held on you and hit you with </v>

698
00:38:06.641 --> 00:38:06.641
<v Speaker 1>a haymaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might be able to put you out.</v>

699
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:10.430
<v Speaker 1>If you're a person who is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

700
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:14.930
<v Speaker 1>built like you and a guy who exercises </v>
<v Speaker 1>who strong,</v>

701
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:20.200
<v Speaker 1>and then there's someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>identically built like you who's a black</v>

702
00:38:20.241 --> 00:38:25.241
<v Speaker 1>belt in Brazilian Jujitsu and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any experience in martial arts at </v>

703
00:38:25.241 --> 00:38:27.500
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fucked right?</v>

704
00:38:27.501 --> 00:38:32.501
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a person who's built like you </v>

705
00:38:32.501 --> 00:38:35.650
<v Speaker 1>who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who exercises and is healthy and </v>

706
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:38.260
<v Speaker 1>you grapple with the guy who was even </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger than you and bigger than you,</v>

707
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:40.330
<v Speaker 1>but he has no experience in Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

708
00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:43.810
<v Speaker 1>he's still fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference.</v>

709
00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:48.840
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think Brazilian Jujitsu and</v>
<v Speaker 1>judo and wrestling and particularly </v>

710
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.561
<v Speaker 1>those are absolutes in that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of the body and once you grab a </v>

711
00:38:52.801 --> 00:38:57.801
<v Speaker 1>hold of a person's body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no lucky triangle chokes in </v>

712
00:38:58.241 --> 00:38:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

713
00:38:59.450 --> 00:38:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

714
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:01.500
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

715
00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:06.960
<v Speaker 3>I think I would say Jujitsu as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highest representative of that.</v>

716
00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:10.170
<v Speaker 3>I think in wrestling and judo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having practiced those,</v>

717
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.590
<v Speaker 3>I've never been quite as humble and as I</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been in Jujitsu.</v>

718
00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:15.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially when I started,</v>

719
00:39:15.661 --> 00:39:17.610
<v Speaker 3>I was power lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

720
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:22.640
<v Speaker 3>I was a total meathead and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 130 pound guy or girl could tap you </v>

721
00:39:23.701 --> 00:39:24.570
<v Speaker 3>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

722
00:39:24.571 --> 00:39:27.420
<v Speaker 3>It's confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very confusing in wrestling,</v>

723
00:39:27.421 --> 00:39:32.421
<v Speaker 3>you can get pretty far with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had power in judo,</v>

724
00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:37.770
<v Speaker 3>a little bit less so at its highest </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels at if you go to Japan,</v>

725
00:39:37.771 --> 00:39:39.690
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they,</v>

726
00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:44.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean the whole dream of judo is </v>
<v Speaker 3>effortlessly throw your opponent,</v>

727
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.710
<v Speaker 3>but in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

728
00:39:46.711 --> 00:39:51.711
<v Speaker 3>if you go to gyms in America and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

729
00:39:51.721 --> 00:39:56.721
<v Speaker 3>there is some hard wrestling style </v>
<v Speaker 3>gripping and just beating each other up </v>

730
00:39:56.721 --> 00:40:01.400
<v Speaker 3>pretty intensely where we're not talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about beautiful tomatoes are these </v>

731
00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.080
<v Speaker 3>beautiful throws were talking about some</v>
<v Speaker 3>scrapping some,</v>

732
00:40:04.081 --> 00:40:05.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some wrestling style.</v>

733
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

734
00:40:06.701 --> 00:40:07.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

735
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

736
00:40:08.681 --> 00:40:12.850
<v Speaker 1>my experience with Jujitsu was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>humbling when I first started out.</v>

737
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:17.910
<v Speaker 1>I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a long background in martial arts </v>

738
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:21.241
<v Speaker 1>and striking and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even wrestled in high school and then I </v>

739
00:40:21.241 --> 00:40:25.260
<v Speaker 1>started taking Jujitsu and a guy who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>my size and I was young at the time and </v>

740
00:40:25.421 --> 00:40:28.690
<v Speaker 1>he was basically close to my age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just mauled me.</v>

741
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.140
<v Speaker 1>And he wasn't even a black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was a purple belt.</v>

742
00:40:32.141 --> 00:40:33.850
<v Speaker 1>He might've been a blue belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a purple belt.</v>

743
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just destroyed me.</v>

744
00:40:36.491 --> 00:40:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Just did anything he wanted to be choked</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

745
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.290
<v Speaker 1>arm barred me just and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

746
00:40:41.291 --> 00:40:43.840
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am so delusional.</v>

747
00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:48.841
<v Speaker 1>I thought I had a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought just based on taking a couple </v>

748
00:40:49.181 --> 00:40:54.181
<v Speaker 1>classes and learning what an Armbar is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then being a strong person who has a</v>

749
00:40:54.461 --> 00:40:59.461
<v Speaker 1>background in martial arts that I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to at least hold him off a </v>

750
00:40:59.461 --> 00:40:59.461
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

751
00:40:59.461 --> 00:41:01.440
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a uh,</v>

752
00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:06.830
<v Speaker 3>that's so beautiful that I feel lucky to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have that had that experience of having </v>

753
00:41:07.711 --> 00:41:09.900
<v Speaker 3>my ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Philadelphia is where I came up with</v>

754
00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.400
<v Speaker 3>because in science you don't often get </v>
<v Speaker 3>that experience in the space of ideas.</v>

755
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:16.890
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

756
00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:21.891
<v Speaker 3>you can't choke each other out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't beat each other up and </v>

757
00:41:21.891 --> 00:41:22.980
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's easy to go your whole life.</v>

758
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:26.670
<v Speaker 3>I have so many people around me telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>me how smart I am a,</v>

759
00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:32.100
<v Speaker 3>there's no way to actually know if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart or not because I think I'm full of</v>

760
00:41:32.101 --> 00:41:34.280
<v Speaker 3>bs and in the same,</v>

761
00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:38.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I in the same round is fighting.</v>

762
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:43.750
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Hixon Gracie said it means the or </v>

763
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:45.980
<v Speaker 2>some of the solid rubber or somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the math doesn't lie.</v>

764
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:50.180
<v Speaker 2>There's this deep honesty in it that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>really grateful.</v>

765
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:53.090
<v Speaker 2>Almost like wanting to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullies.</v>

766
00:41:53.091 --> 00:41:58.091
<v Speaker 2>Are you talking about or even just my </v>
<v Speaker 2>fellow academics could benefit </v>

767
00:41:58.091 --> 00:41:59.870
<v Speaker 2>significantly from training a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

768
00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:01.760
<v Speaker 2>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

769
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:07.300
<v Speaker 2>it's a beautiful thing to almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think has been talked about in high </v>

770
00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:07.820
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of requiring it,</v>

771
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:12.470
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the meantime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's a more humbling sport to</v>

772
00:42:12.471 --> 00:42:15.920
<v Speaker 2>be honest than wrestling because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could in wrestling,</v>

773
00:42:15.921 --> 00:42:18.860
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get away with some muscle.</v>

774
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:24.030
<v Speaker 1>It's also what martial arts we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be in that a small person </v>

775
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:26.250
<v Speaker 1>who knows technique can beat a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who doesn't know the technique.</v>

776
00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.900
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we've always hoped for.</v>

777
00:42:28.901 --> 00:42:33.901
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we saw the Bruce Lee movies and </v>

778
00:42:33.901 --> 00:42:35.971
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee who was a smaller guy can beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these bigger guys just because he </v>

779
00:42:35.971 --> 00:42:38.080
<v Speaker 1>had better technique that is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>real in Jujitsu and it's one of the only</v>

780
00:42:38.081 --> 00:42:40.600
<v Speaker 1>martial arts where that's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

781
00:42:40.601 --> 00:42:41.800
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

782
00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I haven't</v>

783
00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:43.890
<v Speaker 2>in Philadelphia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It started,</v>

784
00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.780
<v Speaker 2>we had Steve Maxwell here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

785
00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:50.930
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the spring of Jujitsu in </v>

786
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia.</v>

787
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the very first American </v>

788
00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:54.680
<v Speaker 1>black belts in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like way back in the day,</v>

789
00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:59.091
<v Speaker 1>I believe he was a black belt in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very early nineties when Jujitsu was </v>

790
00:42:59.091 --> 00:43:04.041
<v Speaker 1>really just starting to come to America </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had Max innercise in </v>

791
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Philadelphia.</v>

792
00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:08.550
<v Speaker 2>It's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I trained at a balance which is</v>

793
00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.710
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few gracie folks.</v>

794
00:43:10.711 --> 00:43:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Which film?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Inglorious rake,</v>

795
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:14.000
<v Speaker 2>mcglynn Hays basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go brothers.</v>

796
00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:15.210
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

797
00:43:15.211 --> 00:43:18.320
<v Speaker 2>especially Vogel brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these couple of black belts,</v>

798
00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:20.910
<v Speaker 2>they come up together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there.</v>

799
00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're smaller,</v>

800
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:28.680
<v Speaker 2>the little guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think those were the guys that </v>

801
00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:28.680
<v Speaker 2>really humbled me pretty quickly.</v>

802
00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little guys are the best to learn </v>

803
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:33.260
<v Speaker 1>technique from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

804
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Because they can't rely on strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of really big,</v>

805
00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.320
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

806
00:43:37.321 --> 00:43:42.321
<v Speaker 1>250 pounds Jujitsu guys who never are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to develop the sort of subtlety of</v>

807
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:47.160
<v Speaker 1>technique that some like the Mayo </v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers,</v>

808
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:51.900
<v Speaker 1>like smaller guys who just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've from the very beginning,</v>

809
00:43:51.901 --> 00:43:56.901
<v Speaker 1>they've never had an advantage in weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and size and so they've never been able </v>

810
00:43:56.901 --> 00:44:00.891
<v Speaker 1>to use anything but perfect technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo is another great example of </v>

811
00:44:00.891 --> 00:44:00.891
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

812
00:44:00.891 --> 00:44:02.640
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he competed in the 140 pounds,</v>

813
00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:05.330
<v Speaker 1>145 pound class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

814
00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:10.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to get back to artificial </v>

815
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.850
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that there's two camps,</v>

816
00:44:11.851 --> 00:44:16.851
<v Speaker 1>there's one camp that thinks that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exponential increase in technology and </v>

817
00:44:17.551 --> 00:44:20.070
<v Speaker 1>that once artificial intelligence become</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentient,</v>

818
00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:25.460
<v Speaker 1>it could eventually improve upon its own</v>
<v Speaker 1>design and literally become a god in a </v>

819
00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:31.490
<v Speaker 1>short amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the other school of </v>

820
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:34.521
<v Speaker 1>thought that thinks that is far outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the realm of what is possible today.</v>

821
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:41.270
<v Speaker 1>That even the speculation of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually taking place is kind of </v>

822
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.970
<v Speaker 1>ludicrous to imagine.</v>

823
00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:43.700
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

824
00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:48.760
<v Speaker 3>And the balance needs to be struck </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think I'd like to talk about </v>

825
00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.040
<v Speaker 3>sort of the short term threats that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and it's really important to think</v>

826
00:44:52.041 --> 00:44:54.500
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the longterm threats,</v>

827
00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:58.580
<v Speaker 3>if they come to fruition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will overpower everything.</v>

828
00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.130
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really important to think about,</v>

829
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:06.550
<v Speaker 3>but what happens is if you think too </v>
<v Speaker 3>much about the encroaching doom of </v>

830
00:45:07.191 --> 00:45:12.191
<v Speaker 3>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is some aspect to it that is </v>

831
00:45:12.191 --> 00:45:16.301
<v Speaker 3>paralyzing where you almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turns you off from actually thinking </v>

832
00:45:16.761 --> 00:45:20.570
<v Speaker 3>about the these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something so appealing.</v>

833
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:25.930
<v Speaker 3>It's like a black hole that pulls you in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you notice folks at Sam Harrison,</v>

834
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:31.390
<v Speaker 3>so on spend a large amount of the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about the negative stuff about </v>

835
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:38.950
<v Speaker 3>something that's far away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not to say it's not wrong to talk about </v>

836
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:42.731
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they spend very little time about </v>

837
00:45:42.731 --> 00:45:44.771
<v Speaker 3>the potential positive impacts in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>near term and also the negative impacts </v>

838
00:45:44.771 --> 00:45:44.990
<v Speaker 3>of the near term.</v>

839
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:50.410
<v Speaker 3>So let's go over those fairness so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way the more and more we put decisions </v>

840
00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.180
<v Speaker 3>about our lives into the hands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence systems,</v>

841
00:45:56.450 --> 00:46:01.450
<v Speaker 3>whether you get a loan or a in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomous vehicle context or in terms </v>

842
00:46:02.871 --> 00:46:07.871
<v Speaker 3>of recommending jobs for you on Linkedin</v>
<v Speaker 3>or all of these kinds of things,</v>

843
00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.440
<v Speaker 3>the idea of fairness becomes a bias in </v>
<v Speaker 3>these machine learning systems becomes a</v>

844
00:46:14.721 --> 00:46:19.040
<v Speaker 3>really big threat because the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>current,</v>

845
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:25.160
<v Speaker 3>the way current artificial intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems function is they train on data.</v>

846
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:30.730
<v Speaker 3>So there's no way to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for them to somehow gain a greater </v>

847
00:46:30.921 --> 00:46:33.950
<v Speaker 3>intelligence than our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than the data we provide them with.</v>

848
00:46:33.951 --> 00:46:37.970
<v Speaker 3>So we provide them with actual data and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so they carry over if we're not careful,</v>

849
00:46:37.971 --> 00:46:42.971
<v Speaker 3>the biases in that data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the discrimination that's inherent in </v>

850
00:46:42.971 --> 00:46:45.710
<v Speaker 3>our current society is as represented by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the data.</v>

851
00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:47.660
<v Speaker 3>So they'll just carry that forward.</v>

852
00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Like also a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's people working in this,</v>

853
00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:52.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more so to see,</v>

854
00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:57.940
<v Speaker 3>to show really the negative impacts in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of getting a loan or whether to </v>

855
00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:04.670
<v Speaker 3>say whether this particular human being </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be convicted or not of a crime.</v>

856
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:06.860
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

857
00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:11.240
<v Speaker 3>there's ideas there that can carry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

858
00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:16.300
<v Speaker 3>in our criminal system there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>discrimination and if you use data from </v>

859
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.250
<v Speaker 3>that criminal system to then assist the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ciders,</v>

860
00:47:19.251 --> 00:47:21.200
<v Speaker 3>judges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>juries,</v>

861
00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:26.260
<v Speaker 3>lawyers in making this community and </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a decision of what kind of policy </v>

862
00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.340
<v Speaker 3>person gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to carry that forward.</v>

863
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:32.690
<v Speaker 3>You mean like racial economic bias is </v>
<v Speaker 3>racial economic?</v>

864
00:47:32.691 --> 00:47:34.600
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Geographical.</v>

865
00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.860
<v Speaker 3>And that's a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't say that exact problem,</v>

866
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:39.570
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

867
00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:44.710
<v Speaker 3>you're aware of it because of the tools </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're using it only.</v>

868
00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:50.810
<v Speaker 3>So the two ways that I'd like to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about neural networks with the jail do </v>

869
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.540
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

870
00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:57.580
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the current approaches are,</v>

871
00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.350
<v Speaker 3>there's been a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

872
00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:05.760
<v Speaker 3>demonstrated improvements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exciting new improvements in our </v>

873
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:10.171
<v Speaker 3>advancements of artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those are for the most part have to </v>

874
00:48:10.171 --> 00:48:14.371
<v Speaker 3>do when your networks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something has been around since the 19 </v>

875
00:48:14.371 --> 00:48:17.761
<v Speaker 3>forties has gone to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to ai winters where everyone was super </v>

876
00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:20.410
<v Speaker 3>hyped and then super bummed and super </v>
<v Speaker 3>hyped again and bombed again.</v>

877
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:25.411
<v Speaker 3>And now we're in this other hype cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what you'll know xr is these </v>

878
00:48:25.991 --> 00:48:29.020
<v Speaker 3>collections of interconnected simple </v>
<v Speaker 3>compute units.</v>

879
00:48:29.021 --> 00:48:34.021
<v Speaker 3>They're all similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like it's inspired by own </v>

880
00:48:34.021 --> 00:48:37.441
<v Speaker 3>brain where have a bunch of little </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurons interconnected and the idea is </v>

881
00:48:37.441 --> 00:48:39.820
<v Speaker 3>these interconnections are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominant and random,</v>

882
00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:45.060
<v Speaker 3>but if you feed it with some data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll learn to connect just like </v>

883
00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.050
<v Speaker 3>they're doing our brain in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 3>interprets that data.</v>

884
00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:50.440
<v Speaker 3>They formed representations of that data</v>
<v Speaker 3>and can make decisions,</v>

885
00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:54.520
<v Speaker 3>but there's only two ways to train those</v>
<v Speaker 3>neural networks that we have.</v>

886
00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is we have to provide a large data </v>

887
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:03.401
<v Speaker 3>set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want that annual now could tell </v>

888
00:49:03.401 --> 00:49:04.420
<v Speaker 3>the difference between a cat and dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to give it 10,000</v>

889
00:49:04.421 --> 00:49:06.940
<v Speaker 3>images of a cat and $10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a dog.</v>

890
00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:13.080
<v Speaker 3>You need to give those images and who </v>
<v Speaker 3>tells you what a picture of a cat and a </v>

891
00:49:14.171 --> 00:49:15.670
<v Speaker 3>dog is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's humans,</v>

892
00:49:15.671 --> 00:49:20.671
<v Speaker 3>so it has to be annotated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as teachers of these artificial </v>

893
00:49:20.671 --> 00:49:22.090
<v Speaker 3>intelligence systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to collect this data.</v>

894
00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:27.690
<v Speaker 3>We have to invest a significant amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of effort and annotate that data and </v>

895
00:49:28.691 --> 00:49:31.570
<v Speaker 3>then we teach neural networks to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>that prediction.</v>

896
00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:37.120
<v Speaker 3>The what's not obvious there is how poor</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a method there is to achieve any kind</v>

897
00:49:39.071 --> 00:49:44.071
<v Speaker 3>of greater degree of intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just not able to get very far </v>

898
00:49:44.071 --> 00:49:48.720
<v Speaker 3>besides very specific narrow tasks of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cat versus dog or a,</v>

899
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:54.520
<v Speaker 3>should I give this person a loan or not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These kinds of simple simple tasks,</v>

900
00:49:55.120 --> 00:50:00.120
<v Speaker 3>I would argue autonomous vehicles that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are actually beyond the scope of that </v>

901
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.571
<v Speaker 3>kind of approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the other realm of where you </v>

902
00:50:03.571 --> 00:50:07.270
<v Speaker 3>know networks can be trained is if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can simulate that world.</v>

903
00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:12.960
<v Speaker 3>So if the world is simple enough or it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>conducive to be formalized sufficiently </v>

904
00:50:14.981 --> 00:50:18.070
<v Speaker 3>to where you can simulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a game of chess is just,</v>

905
00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:21.910
<v Speaker 3>it's rules him a golden rule so you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>simulate it.</v>

906
00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.600
<v Speaker 3>They had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The big exciting thing about Google deep</v>

907
00:50:25.601 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 3>mind is that there able to beat</v>

908
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.550
<v Speaker 3>the world champion by doing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>called competitive self play a,</v>

909
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:35.390
<v Speaker 3>which is the two systems play against </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

910
00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.580
<v Speaker 3>They don't need the human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they play against each other,</v>

911
00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:43.060
<v Speaker 3>but that only works and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful idea and super powerful and </v>

912
00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:45.800
<v Speaker 3>really interesting and surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that only works on things like games</v>

913
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:49.460
<v Speaker 3>and simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now if I wanted to,</v>

914
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:55.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry to be going to analogies of like </v>

915
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:57.810
<v Speaker 3>USC for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I wanted to train the system to </v>

916
00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:01.160
<v Speaker 3>become the world champion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

917
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:03.170
<v Speaker 3>be uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's his name?</v>

918
00:51:03.171 --> 00:51:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Numbering them add up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

919
00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:09.710
<v Speaker 3>I could play the UFC game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could create the,</v>

920
00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:15.090
<v Speaker 3>you networks that play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use competitive self play to play in </v>

921
00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:18.290
<v Speaker 3>that virtual world and they could become</v>
<v Speaker 3>state of the art,</v>

922
00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:23.350
<v Speaker 3>the best fighter ever in that game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But transferring that to the physical </v>

923
00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:24.710
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know how to do that.</v>

924
00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:28.910
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how to teach systems to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff in the real world.</v>

925
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.540
<v Speaker 3>So some of the stuff that freaks you out</v>
<v Speaker 3>often is Boston dynamics robots.</v>

926
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:38.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does every day I go to the instagram </v>

927
00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:38.320
<v Speaker 3>page and just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you guys doing?</v>

928
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:39.190
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

929
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:44.290
<v Speaker 3>nearing our demise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark Graber CEO is a spoke of the class </v>

930
00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:46.640
<v Speaker 3>I taught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is a,</v>

931
00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:51.140
<v Speaker 3>he calls himself a bad boy of robotics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's having a little fun with it.</v>

932
00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:56.200
<v Speaker 3>He should definitely stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't call yourself a bad boy if </v>

933
00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:56.200
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

934
00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:56.200
<v Speaker 3>How old is he?</v>

935
00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:04.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the greatest roboticists of </v>

936
00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:04.300
<v Speaker 3>our generation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's wonderful.</v>

937
00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:05.900
<v Speaker 3>How would you call yourself a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't call yourself a bad boy,</v>

938
00:52:05.901 --> 00:52:06.770
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

939
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:11.040
<v Speaker 3>so you say you're not the bad boy of </v>
<v Speaker 3>MMA?</v>

940
00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:16.110
<v Speaker 3>Definitely not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not even the bad man.</v>

941
00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:21.800
<v Speaker 3>Bad Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but definitely not a bad boy.</v>

942
00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a little silly.</v>

943
00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:30.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The those robots are actually </v>

944
00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:30.800
<v Speaker 3>functioning in the physical world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

945
00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:36.370
<v Speaker 3>And they are using something called </v>
<v Speaker 3>always I think coined,</v>

946
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:38.600
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies or eighties.</v>

947
00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:43.660
<v Speaker 3>The term good old fashioned ai meaning </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is nothing like going on that you </v>

948
00:52:45.771 --> 00:52:50.771
<v Speaker 3>would consider artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is usually connected to learning.</v>

949
00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:57.550
<v Speaker 3>So these systems aren't learning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you dropped a puppy into </v>

950
00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:01.091
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the world and you kind of stumbled </v>

951
00:53:01.091 --> 00:53:02.771
<v Speaker 3>around and figuring stuff out and learns</v>
<v Speaker 3>and gets better and better and better </v>

952
00:53:02.771 --> 00:53:02.771
<v Speaker 3>and better.</v>

953
00:53:02.771 --> 00:53:06.580
<v Speaker 3>That's the scary part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the imagination that that's what </v>

954
00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.911
<v Speaker 3>we imagined is we put something in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>world at first it's like harmless and </v>

955
00:53:09.921 --> 00:53:14.921
<v Speaker 3>falls all over the place and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden they figure something out and </v>

956
00:53:14.921 --> 00:53:15.470
<v Speaker 3>like Elon Musk says the travels faster </v>
<v Speaker 3>than whatever.</v>

957
00:53:15.471 --> 00:53:17.740
<v Speaker 3>Then you can only see what the problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

958
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:23.320
<v Speaker 3>There's no learning component there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just purely there's hydraulics </v>

959
00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:29.610
<v Speaker 3>and electric motors and there is 20 to </v>
<v Speaker 3>30 degrees of freedom and it's doing </v>

960
00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:37.440
<v Speaker 3>hardcoded control algorithms to control </v>
<v Speaker 3>the task of how do you move efficiently </v>

961
00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:42.141
<v Speaker 3>through space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the task of this work on a </v>

962
00:53:42.141 --> 00:53:45.681
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really hard problem is taking a robotic </v>

963
00:53:45.681 --> 00:53:46.620
<v Speaker 3>manipulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking arm,</v>

964
00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:51.830
<v Speaker 3>grabbing a water bottle and lifting it </v>
<v Speaker 3>super hard for the somewhat unsolved to </v>

965
00:53:52.321 --> 00:53:57.321
<v Speaker 3>this point and learning to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We really don't know how to do that </v>

966
00:53:57.321 --> 00:53:57.321
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

967
00:53:57.550 --> 00:54:02.550
<v Speaker 1>but this is what we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially is the convergence of these </v>

968
00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:04.450
<v Speaker 1>robotic systems with artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence systems,</v>

969
00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:06.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as artificial intelligence,</v>

970
00:54:06.590 --> 00:54:11.590
<v Speaker 1>intelligence systems evolve and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>this convergence becomes complete.</v>

971
00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:17.580
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have the ability to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like the computer that beat </v>

972
00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:20.980
<v Speaker 1>humans at go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have creativity,</v>

973
00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:26.250
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of language and </v>

974
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:30.120
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to have perhaps even </v>

975
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.860
<v Speaker 1>engineered things like emotions like </v>
<v Speaker 1>jealousy and anger.</v>

976
00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible,</v>

977
00:54:35.381 --> 00:54:40.381
<v Speaker 1>but as you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have systems that could </v>

978
00:54:40.381 --> 00:54:44.551
<v Speaker 1>potentially be biased the way human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings are biased towards people of </v>

979
00:54:44.551 --> 00:54:49.111
<v Speaker 1>certain economic groups or certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>geographic groups and you would use that</v>

980
00:54:49.151 --> 00:54:52.570
<v Speaker 1>data that they have to discriminate just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like human beings discriminating.</v>

981
00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:58.610
<v Speaker 1>What if you have all that in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificially intelligent robot that has </v>

982
00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:00.400
<v Speaker 1>autonomy and that has the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>

983
00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:05.640
<v Speaker 1>This is what people are totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with and terrified of is that </v>

984
00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:08.440
<v Speaker 1>all of these different systems that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently in Semite crude states,</v>

985
00:55:08.441 --> 00:55:13.441
<v Speaker 1>they can't pick up a water bottle yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't really do much other than </v>

986
00:55:13.441 --> 00:55:13.441
<v Speaker 1>they can do back flips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they.</v>

987
00:55:13.441 --> 00:55:15.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've seen this,</v>

988
00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:19.240
<v Speaker 1>the more recent Boston dynamic ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powercore yeah,</v>

989
00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:20.940
<v Speaker 1>I saw that one the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

990
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:22.780
<v Speaker 1>They're getting better and better and </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

991
00:55:22.781 --> 00:55:25.600
<v Speaker 1>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's increasing every year.</v>

992
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Every year there's new abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the Black Mirror episode?</v>

993
00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Heavy metal?</v>

994
00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:35.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think about quite a lot because </v>

995
00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:37.991
<v Speaker 3>it's a functionally it has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know how to do most aspects of that </v>

996
00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:41.870
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now.</v>

997
00:55:41.871 --> 00:55:42.550
<v Speaker 3>When you close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

998
00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:43.520
<v Speaker 3>pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I.</v>

999
00:55:43.521 --> 00:55:48.521
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some kind of pebbles shooting </v>

1000
00:55:48.521 --> 00:55:50.210
<v Speaker 3>situation where it like hurts you by </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting you somehow.</v>

1001
00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:51.470
<v Speaker 3>I figured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1002
00:55:51.471 --> 00:55:52.580
<v Speaker 3>it has bullets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't it?</v>

1003
00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:53.300
<v Speaker 3>Bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Is it basically a gun?</v>

1005
00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:56.690
<v Speaker 1>It had a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stuck into one of its arms.</v>

1006
00:55:56.691 --> 00:56:01.691
<v Speaker 1>Remember and come the spoiler alert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just an amazing episode of how </v>

1007
00:56:01.691 --> 00:56:06.580
<v Speaker 1>terrifying it would be if some </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionless robot with incredible </v>

1008
00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.870
<v Speaker 1>abilities is coming after you and wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to terminate you</v>

1009
00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:14.180
<v Speaker 3>and I think about that a lot because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>love that episode because it's </v>

1010
00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:19.040
<v Speaker 3>terrifying for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I sit down and actually in the </v>

1011
00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:22.971
<v Speaker 3>work we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about how we would do that so we </v>

1012
00:56:22.971 --> 00:56:23.970
<v Speaker 3>can do the actual movement of the robot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1013
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:28.980
<v Speaker 3>we don't know how to do is to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>robots that do the full thing,</v>

1014
00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.780
<v Speaker 3>which is have some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

1015
00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:34.790
<v Speaker 3>have a goal of pursuing humans and </v>
<v Speaker 3>eradicated.</v>

1016
00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:37.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm not spoiler alert all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

1017
00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:42.340
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the goal of eradicating human,</v>

1018
00:56:42.341 --> 00:56:44.650
<v Speaker 3>so assuming their values are not aligned</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow,</v>

1019
00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:50.160
<v Speaker 3>that's one we don't know how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And two is the entire process of just </v>

1020
00:56:50.411 --> 00:56:54.310
<v Speaker 3>navigating all over the world is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult.</v>

1021
00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:59.700
<v Speaker 3>So we know how to go up the stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to say how to navigate the path you </v>

1022
00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:04.621
<v Speaker 3>took from home to the studio today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to get through that full path is so </v>

1023
00:57:04.621 --> 00:57:05.860
<v Speaker 3>much an unsolved problem.</v>

1024
00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:11.130
<v Speaker 1>But is it because you could do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could engineer or you could program </v>

1025
00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:14.431
<v Speaker 1>it into your tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put it into your navigation </v>

1026
00:57:14.431 --> 00:57:17.281
<v Speaker 1>system and have it stop at Red Lights </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive for you take turns and it can do </v>

1027
00:57:17.501 --> 00:57:17.770
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1028
00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:23.810
<v Speaker 3>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I would argue is quite far away </v>

1029
00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:24.120
<v Speaker 3>from still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's within 10,</v>

1030
00:57:24.121 --> 00:57:25.320
<v Speaker 3>20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what,</v>

1031
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:29.460
<v Speaker 3>how much can it do now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can stay inside the lane,</v>

1032
00:57:29.461 --> 00:57:33.180
<v Speaker 3>on the highway or on different roads and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can change lanes,</v>

1033
00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:38.480
<v Speaker 3>and what's being pushed now is they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to be able to enter and exit the </v>

1034
00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.920
<v Speaker 3>highway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's some basic highway driving.</v>

1035
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:45.950
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't stop at traffic lights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't stop at stop signs and it </v>

1036
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:50.061
<v Speaker 3>doesn't interact with the complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>irrational human beings,</v>

1037
00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:53.790
<v Speaker 3>pedestrians and cyclists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>

1038
00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:59.090
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the onion I talked about is we </v>

1039
00:57:59.090 --> 00:58:01.650
<v Speaker 3>first in 2005,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Darpa grand challenge.</v>

1040
00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:05.250
<v Speaker 3>Dopper organized this challenge in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>desert says,</v>

1041
00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:10.520
<v Speaker 3>let's go across the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if we can build an autonomous </v>

1042
00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:10.520
<v Speaker 3>vehicle that goes across the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two thousand four,</v>

1043
00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:14.400
<v Speaker 3>the first one and everybody failed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about some of the smartest</v>

1044
00:58:14.401 --> 00:58:18.630
<v Speaker 3>people in the world and really tried and</v>
<v Speaker 3>failed and so they did.</v>

1045
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:19.800
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2005.</v>

1046
00:58:20.310 --> 00:58:25.310
<v Speaker 3>There's a few.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stanford one is a really bad ass guy </v>

1047
00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:25.460
<v Speaker 3>from Cmu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Read that.</v>

1048
00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:30.480
<v Speaker 3>I think he's like a marine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He led the team there and they </v>

1049
00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:30.480
<v Speaker 3>succeeded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fourteens finished Stanford,</v>

1050
00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:35.031
<v Speaker 3>one that was in the desert and there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>this feeling that we solved the </v>

1051
00:58:35.031 --> 00:58:38.430
<v Speaker 3>autonomous driving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's that onion because you then,</v>

1052
00:58:38.431 --> 00:58:39.690
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the next step?</v>

1053
00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:42.510
<v Speaker 3>We've got a card that travels across the</v>
<v Speaker 3>desert autonomously.</v>

1054
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:46.680
<v Speaker 3>What's the next?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then 2007.</v>

1055
00:58:46.770 --> 00:58:49.650
<v Speaker 3>They did the urban grant challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the urban challenge.</v>

1056
00:58:49.651 --> 00:58:54.651
<v Speaker 3>Darpa urban challenge where you drove </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the city a little bit and again,</v>

1057
00:58:54.751 --> 00:58:59.010
<v Speaker 3>super hard problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People took it on a Cmu one.</v>

1058
00:58:59.011 --> 00:59:02.460
<v Speaker 3>That one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Stanford second I believe,</v>

1059
00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:06.750
<v Speaker 3>and then there was definitely a feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1060
00:59:06.751 --> 00:59:09.330
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we now the car drive around the city.</v>

1061
00:59:09.331 --> 00:59:12.990
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely solved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is those cars were traveling</v>

1062
00:59:12.991 --> 00:59:17.991
<v Speaker 3>super slow first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and second of all there's no </v>

1063
00:59:17.991 --> 00:59:17.991
<v Speaker 3>pedestrians.</v>

1064
00:59:17.991 --> 00:59:19.110
<v Speaker 3>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a real city.</v>

1065
00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:24.140
<v Speaker 3>It was an artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just basically having to stop and </v>

1066
00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:27.581
<v Speaker 3>different signs again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one other layer of the onion and he'd </v>

1067
00:59:27.581 --> 00:59:27.581
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1068
00:59:27.581 --> 00:59:30.440
<v Speaker 3>when we actually have to put this car in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a city like La,</v>

1069
00:59:31.090 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to make this work because if</v>

1070
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:39.080
<v Speaker 3>there's no cars in the street and no </v>
<v Speaker 3>pedestrians in the street driving around</v>

1071
00:59:39.081 --> 00:59:44.081
<v Speaker 3>is still hard but doable and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>solvable the next five years when you </v>

1072
00:59:44.081 --> 00:59:49.061
<v Speaker 3>put pedestrians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody Jaywalks if you put human </v>

1073
00:59:49.221 --> 00:59:50.900
<v Speaker 3>beings into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into this interaction,</v>

1074
00:59:50.901 --> 00:59:52.370
<v Speaker 3>it becomes much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much harder.</v>

1075
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not impossible and I think it's </v>

1076
00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:59.960
<v Speaker 3>very doable and with completely new </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting ideas,</v>

1077
01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:05.380
<v Speaker 3>including revolutionizing infrastructure</v>
<v Speaker 3>and rethinking a transportation in </v>

1078
01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:06.980
<v Speaker 3>general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's possible to do the next five,</v>

1079
01:00:06.981 --> 01:00:08.360
<v Speaker 3>10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 20,</v>

1080
01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:13.790
<v Speaker 3>but it's not easy like everybody says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And does anybody say it's easy?</v>

1081
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:15.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

1082
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:17.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1083
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.400
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of height between </v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomous,</v>

1084
01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:24.610
<v Speaker 3>behind the autonomous vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elon musk himself and other people have </v>

1085
01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:26.690
<v Speaker 3>promised autonomous vehicles that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>timeline is already past.</v>

1086
01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:31.980
<v Speaker 3>That has been going on in 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll have autonomous vehicles now for </v>

1087
01:00:32.691 --> 01:00:32.940
<v Speaker 3>ge</v>

1088
01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>semiautonomous now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1089
01:00:34.651 --> 01:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>So I know they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can break for pedestrians.</v>

1090
01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Like if they see pedestrians are </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to break for them and avoid </v>

1091
01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:43.790
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1092
01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:45.480
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the technically no.</v>

1093
01:00:45.550 --> 01:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Was that an issue with an Uber Car that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit a pedestrian that was operating </v>

1094
01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>autonomously?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone,</v>

1095
01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:52.750
<v Speaker 1>a homeless person stepped out off of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>median,</v>

1096
01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>right into traffic and it nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they found out it didn't have </v>

1097
01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:58.150
<v Speaker 1>just one of the settings</v>

1098
01:00:58.310 --> 01:00:59.680
<v Speaker 3>wasn't in place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all right.</v>

1099
01:00:59.681 --> 01:01:02.590
<v Speaker 3>But that wasn't autonomous vehicles </v>
<v Speaker 3>being tested in Arizona.</v>

1100
01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.750
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately there's a fatality.</v>

1101
01:01:04.751 --> 01:01:06.070
<v Speaker 3>A person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person died at.</v>

1102
01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:09.550
<v Speaker 3>Pedestrian was killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happened there?</v>

1103
01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:15.650
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing I'm saying is really </v>

1104
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:15.650
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's full autonomy.</v>

1105
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:18.460
<v Speaker 3>That's technically when the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can remove the steering wheel in the</v>

1106
01:01:18.461 --> 01:01:20.470
<v Speaker 3>car to drive itself and take care of </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1107
01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:22.300
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen,</v>

1108
01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:27.360
<v Speaker 3>everything we're studying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're studying drivers and Tesla </v>

1109
01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.150
<v Speaker 3>vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're building our own vehicles.</v>

1110
01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:33.750
<v Speaker 3>It seems that it will be a long way off </v>
<v Speaker 3>before console the fully autonomous </v>

1111
01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:37.390
<v Speaker 3>driving problem because of pedestrians </v>
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>

1112
01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:42.410
<v Speaker 3>But two things and pedestrians and </v>
<v Speaker 3>cyclists and the edge cases are driving </v>

1113
01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:48.660
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff we take for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same reason we take for granted how </v>

1114
01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:51.430
<v Speaker 3>hard it is to walk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how hard it is to pick up this bottle,</v>

1115
01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:55.900
<v Speaker 3>our intuition about what's hard and easy</v>
<v Speaker 3>is really flawed as human beings.</v>

1116
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Can I interject what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1117
01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:01.350
<v Speaker 1>all cars were autonomous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1118
01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:06.340
<v Speaker 1>If we got to a point where every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>car on the highway is operating off of a</v>

1119
01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:08.650
<v Speaker 1>similar algorithm or off the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

1120
01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.870
<v Speaker 1>then things would be far easier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1121
01:02:10.871 --> 01:02:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Because then you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1122
01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:14.050
<v Speaker 1>don't deal with random kinetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements.</v>

1123
01:02:14.051 --> 01:02:17.640
<v Speaker 1>People just changing lanes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people looking at their cell phone,</v>

1124
01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:19.060
<v Speaker 1>not paying attention to what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

1125
01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:21.480
<v Speaker 1>All sorts of things that you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>wary of right now.</v>

1126
01:02:21.481 --> 01:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Driving and pedestrians and bicyclists.</v>

1127
01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:25.980
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1128
01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:31.170
<v Speaker 3>that's in the realm of things I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about where you think outside </v>

1129
01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:33.821
<v Speaker 3>the box and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and revolutionize our transportation </v>

1130
01:02:33.821 --> 01:02:34.830
<v Speaker 3>system that requires government to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1131
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:36.530
<v Speaker 3>to play along.</v>

1132
01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.820
<v Speaker 1>It seems like that's going that way </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

1133
01:02:37.821 --> 01:02:42.821
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like that one day we're </v>

1134
01:02:42.821 --> 01:02:43.430
<v Speaker 1>going to have autonomous driving pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much everywhere,</v>

1135
01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:45.140
<v Speaker 1>especially on the highway.</v>

1136
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.250
<v Speaker 3>It's not going there in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1137
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:51.330
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very slow moving.</v>

1138
01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:54.180
<v Speaker 3>So if government does stuff very slow </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving with infrastructure,</v>

1139
01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:59.360
<v Speaker 3>one of the biggest things you can do for</v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomous driving will solve a lot of </v>

1140
01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.081
<v Speaker 3>problems is to paint lane markings </v>
<v Speaker 3>regularly.</v>

1141
01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:07.180
<v Speaker 3>And even that sucks have been extremely </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to do for,</v>

1142
01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:08.220
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

1143
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a politician</v>

1144
01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.460
<v Speaker 1>because right now there's not really the</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire for it.</v>

1145
01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.630
<v Speaker 1>But to explain to people what you mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>by that.</v>

1146
01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:21.260
<v Speaker 1>When the lanes are painted very clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cameras and the autonomous vehicles </v>

1147
01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.580
<v Speaker 1>can recognize them and stay inside those</v>
<v Speaker 1>lines much more easily.</v>

1148
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is two ways that car see the </v>

1149
01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.700
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three different sensors.</v>

1150
01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:33.300
<v Speaker 3>The big ones for autonomous vehicles is </v>
<v Speaker 3>lidar,</v>

1151
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:38.430
<v Speaker 3>which is these lasers are being shuttled</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the place and three 60 and they can</v>

1152
01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:41.130
<v Speaker 3>give you this point cloud or how far </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff as a way,</v>

1153
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:46.430
<v Speaker 3>but they don't give you the visual </v>
<v Speaker 3>texture information of this is what </v>

1154
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:48.900
<v Speaker 3>brand water bottle they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And cameras give you that information.</v>

1155
01:03:48.901 --> 01:03:51.720
<v Speaker 3>So what Tesla is using have eight </v>
<v Speaker 3>cameras,</v>

1156
01:03:51.721 --> 01:03:55.080
<v Speaker 3>I think is they perceive the world with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1157
01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:56.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with cameras,</v>

1158
01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:00.390
<v Speaker 3>and those two things require different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things from the infrastructure.</v>

1159
01:04:00.391 --> 01:04:03.120
<v Speaker 3>Those two sensors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cameras see the world,</v>

1160
01:04:03.121 --> 01:04:05.310
<v Speaker 3>the same arc as are humanized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see the world.</v>

1161
01:04:05.311 --> 01:04:10.311
<v Speaker 3>So they need the lane markings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they need infrastructure to be really </v>

1162
01:04:10.311 --> 01:04:10.920
<v Speaker 3>nicely visible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>traffic lights to be visible.</v>

1163
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:16.400
<v Speaker 3>So the same kind of things as humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to have is the cameras like to </v>

1164
01:04:16.981 --> 01:04:18.840
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And landmark is a big one.</v>

1165
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:24.470
<v Speaker 3>The other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of interesting </v>

1166
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.470
<v Speaker 3>infrastructure improvements that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

1167
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:28.170
<v Speaker 3>Like traffic lights or traffic lights </v>
<v Speaker 3>are super dumb right now.</v>

1168
01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:33.060
<v Speaker 3>They sense nothing about the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the density of pedestrians,</v>

1169
01:04:33.061 --> 01:04:35.820
<v Speaker 3>about the approach and cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

1170
01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:40.890
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if traffic lights can communicate with </v>

1171
01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:42.090
<v Speaker 3>the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which it makes perfect sense,</v>

1172
01:04:42.091 --> 01:04:42.850
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1173
01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:46.050
<v Speaker 3>it's right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no size limitations.</v>

1174
01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:48.990
<v Speaker 3>It can have a computer inside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1175
01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:53.070
<v Speaker 3>you can coordinate different things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the same pedestrian kinds of</v>

1176
01:04:53.071 --> 01:04:53.390
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1177
01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have sensors now in streets.</v>

1178
01:04:55.310 --> 01:04:57.560
<v Speaker 1>So when you pull up to certain lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at night,</v>

1179
01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the light will be red,</v>

1180
01:04:59.331 --> 01:05:04.331
<v Speaker 1>you pull up an instantaneously turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>green because it recognizes that you've </v>

1181
01:05:04.331 --> 01:05:04.670
<v Speaker 1>stepped over or driven over a sensor.</v>

1182
01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:06.190
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a,</v>

1183
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:10.930
<v Speaker 3>that's a step in the right direction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's really sort of crew 20 years,</v>

1184
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:12.700
<v Speaker 3>30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>

1185
01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 3>So you want to have something like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>power of a smartphone inside</v>

1186
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.530
<v Speaker 2>every traffic light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty basic to do,</v>

1187
01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:25.560
<v Speaker 2>but there is way outside of my expertise</v>
<v Speaker 2>is how do you get government to do these</v>

1188
01:05:25.871 --> 01:05:26.650
<v Speaker 2>kinds of improvements.</v>

1189
01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.730
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I'm mistaken,</v>

1190
01:05:29.731 --> 01:05:34.731
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at things in terms of </v>

1191
01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:34.731
<v Speaker 1>what we can do right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1192
01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:36.300
<v Speaker 1>And a guy like Elon musk or Sam Harris </v>
<v Speaker 1>is saying,</v>

1193
01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:40.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at where technology leads us.</v>

1194
01:05:40.861 --> 01:05:45.861
<v Speaker 1>If you go back to 1960,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of computers that they use to </v>

1195
01:05:45.861 --> 01:05:50.570
<v Speaker 1>do the Apollo mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a whole room full of </v>

1196
01:05:50.570 --> 01:05:53.721
<v Speaker 1>computers that doesn't have nearly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same power as the phone that's in your </v>

1197
01:05:53.721 --> 01:05:57.561
<v Speaker 1>pocket right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you go into the future and </v>

1198
01:05:57.561 --> 01:06:02.270
<v Speaker 1>exponentially calculate like what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to take place in terms of our </v>

1199
01:06:03.661 --> 01:06:08.661
<v Speaker 1>ability to create autonomous vehicles or</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to create artificial </v>

1200
01:06:08.661 --> 01:06:13.431
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and all of these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>going from what we have right now to </v>

1201
01:06:13.951 --> 01:06:18.951
<v Speaker 1>what could be in 20 years where we very </v>
<v Speaker 1>well might look at some sort of an </v>

1202
01:06:20.491 --> 01:06:24.500
<v Speaker 1>artificial being that can communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you some sort of an x mark and that</v>

1203
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.800
<v Speaker 1>type creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1204
01:06:25.801 --> 01:06:30.801
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not outside the realm of </v>

1205
01:06:30.801 --> 01:06:30.801
<v Speaker 1>possibility at all.</v>

1206
01:06:30.801 --> 01:06:32.990
<v Speaker 2>You have to be careful with the at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>part at all.</v>

1207
01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's our ability to predict the future </v>

1208
01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:39.050
<v Speaker 2>is really difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I agree with you.</v>

1209
01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:40.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not outside the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>

1210
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:43.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing,</v>

1211
01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:48.570
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a few examples that brought </v>

1212
01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:49.460
<v Speaker 2>along just because I enjoy these </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictions.</v>

1213
01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.930
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1214
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:56.470
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of how bad we are predicting stuff from </v>

1215
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:59.861
<v Speaker 2>the engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The very guys and gals like me sitting </v>

1216
01:06:59.861 --> 01:07:04.781
<v Speaker 2>before you made some of the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictions in history in terms of both </v>

1217
01:07:04.781 --> 01:07:06.410
<v Speaker 2>pessimistic and optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Wright brothers,</v>

1218
01:07:06.411 --> 01:07:08.960
<v Speaker 2>one of the Wright brothers before they </v>
<v Speaker 2>flew in 19.</v>

1219
01:07:08.961 --> 01:07:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three predicted two years before that it</v>

1220
01:07:12.711 --> 01:07:17.711
<v Speaker 2>will be 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I confess that in 19.</v>

1221
01:07:18.471 --> 01:07:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the brothers talking.</v>

1222
01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:22.340
<v Speaker 2>I said to my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Orville,</v>

1223
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:26.510
<v Speaker 2>that man would not fly for 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two years later,</v>

1224
01:07:26.511 --> 01:07:31.511
<v Speaker 2>we ourselves were making flights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This demonstration of my inability as a </v>

1225
01:07:31.511 --> 01:07:35.951
<v Speaker 2>prophet gave me such shock that I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever since distress them myself and have</v>

1226
01:07:36.831 --> 01:07:40.370
<v Speaker 2>refrained from all prediction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the Wright brothers,</v>

1227
01:07:40.371 --> 01:07:42.530
<v Speaker 2>one of the people working in the past</v>

1228
01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:47.740
<v Speaker 1>mystic estimation versus an optimistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>as explanation or A.</v>

1229
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1230
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:53.230
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the same with a Albert Einstein for </v>

1231
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:56.521
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made these kind of pessimistic </v>

1232
01:07:56.521 --> 01:07:56.521
<v Speaker 2>observations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1233
01:07:56.521 --> 01:07:57.180
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three years before they,</v>

1234
01:07:57.690 --> 01:07:59.730
<v Speaker 2>the first critical chain reaction as </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the,</v>

1235
01:07:59.731 --> 01:08:01.830
<v Speaker 2>he led the nuclear development,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bomb.</v>

1236
01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:04.650
<v Speaker 2>He said that it would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has 90 percent confidence.</v>

1237
01:08:04.651 --> 01:08:07.380
<v Speaker 2>That's impossible three years before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1238
01:08:07.381 --> 01:08:10.110
<v Speaker 2>So that's on the pessimistic side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the optimistic side,</v>

1239
01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:14.310
<v Speaker 2>the history of ai is laden with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with optimistic predictions.</v>

1240
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:15.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1241
01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:17.960
<v Speaker 3>in uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>

1242
01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:19.640
<v Speaker 3>65,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the seminar</v>

1243
01:08:19.690 --> 01:08:24.690
<v Speaker 4>people in ai,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Herbert Simon said machines will be </v>

1244
01:08:24.690 --> 01:08:25.240
<v Speaker 4>capable within 20 years of doing any </v>
<v Speaker 4>work command can do.</v>

1245
01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:30.600
<v Speaker 4>He also said within 10 years of digital </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer will be the world chess </v>

1246
01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:33.811
<v Speaker 4>champion that's in 58 and we didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that until 90 something 90 years and 40 </v>

1247
01:08:34.391 --> 01:08:35.650
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's one person.</v>

1248
01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:40.420
<v Speaker 4>It's a guy taking a stab in the dark </v>
<v Speaker 4>based on what data and what's he,</v>

1249
01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:43.210
<v Speaker 4>what's he based this off of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagination.</v>

1250
01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:46.480
<v Speaker 4>We have more data points now though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you think in terms of.</v>

1251
01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.680
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not about the future.</v>

1252
01:08:48.130 --> 01:08:50.440
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not about the future,</v>

1253
01:08:50.441 --> 01:08:52.960
<v Speaker 4>but about what's possible right now.</v>

1254
01:08:53.490 --> 01:08:58.490
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at the past is a really </v>

1255
01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:59.640
<v Speaker 3>bad predictor of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the past,</v>

1256
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:05.870
<v Speaker 3>what we've done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the immense advancement of technology </v>

1257
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:08.430
<v Speaker 3>has given us in many ways optimism about</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's possible,</v>

1258
01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:12.510
<v Speaker 3>but exactly what is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not good at.</v>

1259
01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:17.960
<v Speaker 3>So I am much more confident that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world will look very fascinating.</v>

1260
01:09:19.661 --> 01:09:24.090
<v Speaker 3>The different in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether ai will be part of that world is</v>

1261
01:09:24.091 --> 01:09:29.091
<v Speaker 3>unclear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be we will all live in a </v>

1262
01:09:29.091 --> 01:09:29.940
<v Speaker 3>virtual reality world for or for </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

1263
01:09:29.941 --> 01:09:34.941
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I'm really think about</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to me a s s a really dumb ai on 1 </v>

1264
01:09:39.450 --> 01:09:44.450
<v Speaker 3>billion smartphones is potentially more </v>
<v Speaker 3>impactful than a superintelligent ai on </v>

1265
01:09:44.821 --> 01:09:47.380
<v Speaker 3>one smartphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the,</v>

1266
01:09:47.690 --> 01:09:52.690
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that everybody now has </v>

1267
01:09:52.690 --> 01:09:52.800
<v Speaker 3>smartphones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of access to information,</v>

1268
01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.270
<v Speaker 3>the way we communicate the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the globalization of everything,</v>

1269
01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:02.300
<v Speaker 3>the potential impact there of just even </v>
<v Speaker 3>subtle improvements in ai could be.</v>

1270
01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.320
<v Speaker 3>It could completely change the fabric of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our society in a way where these </v>

1271
01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:11.211
<v Speaker 3>discussions about an ex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that type lady walking around will be </v>

1272
01:10:11.211 --> 01:10:15.861
<v Speaker 3>silly because we'll all be either living</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Mars or living in virtual reality or </v>

1273
01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:21.560
<v Speaker 3>in this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many exciting possibilities </v>

1274
01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.620
<v Speaker 3>and what I believe in is we have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about them.</v>

1275
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:27.640
<v Speaker 3>We have to talk about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Technology's always the source of </v>

1276
01:10:28.921 --> 01:10:30.690
<v Speaker 3>danger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of risk.</v>

1277
01:10:32.970 --> 01:10:37.970
<v Speaker 3>All of the biggest things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>threatened our civilization at the small</v>

1278
01:10:38.131 --> 01:10:43.131
<v Speaker 3>and large scale all are connected to </v>
<v Speaker 3>misuse of technology.</v>

1279
01:10:43.411 --> 01:10:48.411
<v Speaker 3>We develop and at the same time it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>that very technology that will empower </v>

1280
01:10:49.021 --> 01:10:52.500
<v Speaker 3>us and save us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a Max tegmark brilliant guy,</v>

1281
01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:57.530
<v Speaker 3>like three point zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I recommend people read his book on </v>

1282
01:10:57.530 --> 01:11:00.920
<v Speaker 3>artificial general intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talks about the race that there </v>

1283
01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:01.890
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a race that can't be stopped.</v>

1284
01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:07.160
<v Speaker 3>One is the development of technology and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other is the development of our </v>

1285
01:11:07.681 --> 01:11:12.681
<v Speaker 3>wisdom of how to stop or the how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>control the technology and it's this </v>

1286
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 3>kind of race and</v>

1287
01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:19.460
<v Speaker 2>our wisdom is now is always one step </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind and then that's why we need to </v>

1288
01:11:20.491 --> 01:11:24.210
<v Speaker 2>invest in it and keep sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep always thinking about new ideas.</v>

1289
01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:29.540
<v Speaker 2>So right now we're talking about Ai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what it's going to look </v>

1290
01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:30.810
<v Speaker 2>like in five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to keep thinking about.</v>

1291
01:11:30.811 --> 01:11:35.811
<v Speaker 2>We have to through simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explore different ideas through </v>

1292
01:11:35.811 --> 01:11:39.081
<v Speaker 2>conferences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have debates come up with different </v>

1293
01:11:39.081 --> 01:11:41.280
<v Speaker 2>approaches of how to solve particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

1294
01:11:41.281 --> 01:11:46.281
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with bias or how to solve deep fakes </v>

1295
01:11:46.281 --> 01:11:48.711
<v Speaker 2>where you fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can make Donald Trump or president </v>

1296
01:11:48.711 --> 01:11:52.311
<v Speaker 2>of foreign president Obama saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything or you can have facebook </v>

1297
01:11:52.311 --> 01:11:56.631
<v Speaker 2>advertisement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard hypertargeted a advertisements </v>

1298
01:11:56.631 --> 01:12:00.020
<v Speaker 2>how we can deal with those situations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and constantly have this race of wisdom </v>

1299
01:12:00.181 --> 01:12:01.250
<v Speaker 2>versus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1300
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:05.250
<v Speaker 2>the development of technology but not to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit and think,</v>

1301
01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.940
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the,</v>

1302
01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:11.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the development of technology,</v>

1303
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:16.910
<v Speaker 2>imagine what it could do in 50 years and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all screwed because that's </v>

1304
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.720
<v Speaker 2>important to sort of be nervous about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that way,</v>

1305
01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:27.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's not conducive to what do we do </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and the people that know what </v>

1306
01:12:28.111 --> 01:12:32.060
<v Speaker 2>to do about it are the people trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>build this technology,</v>

1307
01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:33.300
<v Speaker 2>building this future once</v>

1308
01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:35.680
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what to do about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because like,</v>

1309
01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:38.690
<v Speaker 1>well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put it in terms of Elon Musk,</v>

1310
01:12:38.691 --> 01:12:40.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Elon Musk is terrified of,</v>

1311
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.690
<v Speaker 1>of artificial intelligence because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks by the time it becomes sentient,</v>

1312
01:12:44.691 --> 01:12:46.820
<v Speaker 1>it'll be too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be smarter than us.</v>

1313
01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:52.360
<v Speaker 1>And we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have essentially created our </v>

1314
01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:52.360
<v Speaker 1>successors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1315
01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:55.400
<v Speaker 1>And let me quote Joe Rogan and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just one guy.</v>

1316
01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Sam Harris thinks the same thing.</v>

1317
01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's quite a few people that </v>

1318
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.350
<v Speaker 1>think that Sam Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1319
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:06.490
<v Speaker 2>I think was one of the smartest people I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know and Ilan mosque intelligence aside </v>

1320
01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:08.690
<v Speaker 2>is one of the most impactful people I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

1321
01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:13.240
<v Speaker 2>He's actually building these cars and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the narrow ai sense,</v>

1322
01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:17.960
<v Speaker 2>if he's built these autopilot system </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've been studying,</v>

1323
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:24.250
<v Speaker 2>the way that system works is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very surprising to me on many </v>

1324
01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:27.110
<v Speaker 2>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an incredible demonstration of what</v>

1325
01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:30.110
<v Speaker 2>ai can do in a positive way in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1326
01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:34.760
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I people can disagree.</v>

1327
01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure the functional value of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear about the possibility of this.</v>

1328
01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's functional value in pitting the </v>

1329
01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:50.841
<v Speaker 1>brakes before this takes place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The just just to be a person who's </v>

1330
01:13:50.911 --> 01:13:54.900
<v Speaker 1>standing on top of the rocks with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>light to warn the boats.</v>

1331
01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a rock here.</v>

1332
01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Like pay attention to where we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's perils ahead.</v>

1333
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:03.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an.</v>

1334
01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with saying that and I think there's.</v>

1335
01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:10.860
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of room for people saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he saying and people saying what </v>

1336
01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:11.010
<v Speaker 1>you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1337
01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:14.350
<v Speaker 1>what would hurt us is if we tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>silence either voice.</v>

1338
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:19.590
<v Speaker 1>I think what we need in terms of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of this future is many,</v>

1339
01:14:22.271 --> 01:14:22.930
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

1340
01:14:22.931 --> 01:14:25.990
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of these conversations where you're</v>

1341
01:14:25.991 --> 01:14:30.991
<v Speaker 1>dealing with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the current state of technology versus a</v>

1342
01:14:31.931 --> 01:14:36.700
<v Speaker 1>bunch of creative interpretations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>where this could go and have discussions</v>

1343
01:14:36.701 --> 01:14:41.701
<v Speaker 1>about where it should go or what could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the possible pitfalls of any current </v>

1344
01:14:42.941 --> 01:14:47.941
<v Speaker 1>or future actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

1345
01:14:47.941 --> 01:14:50.821
<v Speaker 1>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you say like what's the benefit </v>

1346
01:14:50.821 --> 01:14:51.130
<v Speaker 1>of thinking in a negative way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1347
01:14:51.131 --> 01:14:53.380
<v Speaker 1>it's to prevent our demise.</v>

1348
01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:59.020
<v Speaker 3>So totally I agree on a percent nae </v>
<v Speaker 3>negativity or worry about the </v>

1349
01:15:00.291 --> 01:15:04.520
<v Speaker 3>existential threat is really important </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have as part of the conversation,</v>

1350
01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:06.770
<v Speaker 3>but there's this level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this line.</v>

1351
01:15:06.771 --> 01:15:11.771
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to put into words is it is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>line that you cross when that worry </v>

1352
01:15:11.771 --> 01:15:13.100
<v Speaker 3>becomes hyperbole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1353
01:15:13.101 --> 01:15:15.890
<v Speaker 3>and then it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about the human psyche</v>

1354
01:15:15.891 --> 01:15:17.630
<v Speaker 3>where it becomes paralyzing for some </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>

1355
01:15:17.690 --> 01:15:22.160
<v Speaker 3>Right now when I have beers with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends than none ai folks,</v>

1356
01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:27.460
<v Speaker 3>we actually go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we crossed that line all day and have </v>

1357
01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:28.400
<v Speaker 3>fun with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to she get you drunk right now.</v>

1358
01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:33.700
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a regret every moment of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This I talked to Steve Pinker a </v>

1359
01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:40.060
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now his book kind of highlights that,</v>

1360
01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.090
<v Speaker 3>that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1361
01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:49.620
<v Speaker 3>that he's totally doesn't find that </v>
<v Speaker 3>appealing because that's crossing all </v>

1362
01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:52.520
<v Speaker 3>realms of rationality and reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you say that appealing?</v>

1363
01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:56.030
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean crossing the line into </v>
<v Speaker 3>what will happen in 50 years?</v>

1364
01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:58.390
<v Speaker 3>What could have happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't find that appealing.</v>

1365
01:15:58.770 --> 01:16:03.770
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't find it appealing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's studied and I'm not sure I agree </v>

1366
01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:03.770
<v Speaker 3>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1367
01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:08.470
<v Speaker 3>to the degree that he takes it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he finds that there's no evidence he </v>

1368
01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:15.640
<v Speaker 3>wants there to all our discussions to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>grounded in evidence and data.</v>

1369
01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:21.190
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he highlights the fact that there's </v>

1370
01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:23.830
<v Speaker 3>something about human psyche that </v>
<v Speaker 3>desires this negativity that it wants.</v>

1371
01:16:25.530 --> 01:16:30.530
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something undeniable where we </v>

1372
01:16:30.530 --> 01:16:33.011
<v Speaker 3>want to create an engineer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gods that overpower us and destroy </v>

1373
01:16:33.281 --> 01:16:36.530
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to or we worry about it.</v>

1374
01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:41.450
<v Speaker 3>There's stuff we want to that we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me rephrase that.</v>

1375
01:16:41.451 --> 01:16:44.770
<v Speaker 3>We want to worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about the psyche that.</v>

1376
01:16:44.771 --> 01:16:44.920
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1377
01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:48.040
<v Speaker 1>because you can't take the genie and put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it back in the bottle.</v>

1378
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1379
01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:52.820
<v Speaker 1>when you say there's no reason to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>this way,</v>

1380
01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:58.540
<v Speaker 1>but if you do have cars that are semi </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous now and if you do have </v>

1381
01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:03.341
<v Speaker 1>computers that can beat human beings who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are world go champions and if you do </v>

1382
01:17:03.341 --> 01:17:08.081
<v Speaker 1>have computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>computers that can be people at chess </v>

1383
01:17:08.081 --> 01:17:10.511
<v Speaker 1>and you do have people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently working on artificial </v>

1384
01:17:10.511 --> 01:17:13.031
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and you do Boston dynamics </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are getting these robots to do all </v>

1385
01:17:13.461 --> 01:17:17.870
<v Speaker 1>sorts of spectacular physical stunts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think about the possible future</v>

1386
01:17:17.871 --> 01:17:21.830
<v Speaker 1>convergence of all these technologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you think about the possibility</v>

1387
01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:26.860
<v Speaker 1>of this exponential increase in </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology that allows them to be </v>

1388
01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:28.460
<v Speaker 1>sentient like within a decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two decades,</v>

1389
01:17:28.461 --> 01:17:29.950
<v Speaker 1>three decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1390
01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:34.040
<v Speaker 1>What more evidence do you need your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing all the building blocks of</v>

1391
01:17:34.041 --> 01:17:39.041
<v Speaker 1>a potential successor being laid out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of you and you're seeing what we </v>

1392
01:17:39.041 --> 01:17:42.530
<v Speaker 1>do with every single aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

1393
01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:45.530
<v Speaker 1>We constantly and consistently improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>and innovate right?</v>

1394
01:17:45.531 --> 01:17:50.531
<v Speaker 1>With everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's computers or cars or </v>

1395
01:17:50.531 --> 01:17:52.871
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything today is better than </v>

1396
01:17:52.871 --> 01:17:52.871
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was 20 years ago,</v>

1397
01:17:52.871 --> 01:17:55.280
<v Speaker 1>so if you looked at artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

1398
01:17:55.281 --> 01:17:58.250
<v Speaker 1>which does agree does exist to a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>extent,</v>

1399
01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.940
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at what it could potentially be</v>

1400
01:18:01.941 --> 01:18:03.020
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>

1401
01:18:03.021 --> 01:18:04.610
<v Speaker 1>50 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

1402
01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:08.450
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you look at all these data </v>
<v Speaker 1>points and say,</v>

1403
01:18:08.451 --> 01:18:10.820
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could go bad.</v>

1404
01:18:10.821 --> 01:18:12.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could go great,</v>

1405
01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:14.390
<v Speaker 1>but it could also go bad.</v>

1406
01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:21.490
<v Speaker 2>I do not want to be mistaken as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who is not the champion or the </v>

1407
01:18:21.490 --> 01:18:22.070
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you completely.</v>

1408
01:18:22.150 --> 01:18:25.460
<v Speaker 2>I think it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's impossible at all.</v>

1409
01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:29.530
<v Speaker 2>I think it's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1410
01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:31.600
<v Speaker 2>I think it is inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1411
01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:36.010
<v Speaker 2>It's the Sam Harris argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

1412
01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:39.460
<v Speaker 2>if superintelligence is nothing more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than information processing</v>

1413
01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:40.170
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible]</v>

1414
01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:46.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same as the argument of the simulation </v>

1415
01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:48.080
<v Speaker 2>that we're living in a simulation that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to argue against the fact</v>

1416
01:18:48.081 --> 01:18:53.081
<v Speaker 2>that we're living in a simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is when and what the world </v>

1417
01:18:53.081 --> 01:18:53.840
<v Speaker 2>would look like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1418
01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a race and,</v>

1419
01:18:56.710 --> 01:19:00.950
<v Speaker 2>and it's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to balance those two minds.</v>

1420
01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.270
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

1421
01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:07.271
<v Speaker 2>You and I disagree with my fellow </v>
<v Speaker 2>robotics folks who don't want to think </v>

1422
01:19:07.271 --> 01:19:08.180
<v Speaker 2>about it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course they don't.</v>

1423
01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:08.180
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

1424
01:19:08.230 --> 01:19:13.230
<v Speaker 1>don't want to buy new houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think they've got a lot of money </v>

1425
01:19:13.230 --> 01:19:13.570
<v Speaker 1>invested in this adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to keep the party rolling.</v>

1426
01:19:13.571 --> 01:19:18.571
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to pull the brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody pulled the cords out of the </v>

1427
01:19:18.571 --> 01:19:18.571
<v Speaker 1>walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to stop.</v>

1428
01:19:18.571 --> 01:19:18.940
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's.</v>

1429
01:19:18.970 --> 01:19:20.320
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to come along and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1430
01:19:20.321 --> 01:19:25.321
<v Speaker 1>we've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've run all this data through a </v>

1431
01:19:25.321 --> 01:19:27.001
<v Speaker 1>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we found that if we just keep going </v>

1432
01:19:27.001 --> 01:19:27.001
<v Speaker 1>the way we're going in 30 years from </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1433
01:19:27.001 --> 01:19:30.211
<v Speaker 1>we will have a successor that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide that human beings are outdated </v>

1434
01:19:30.211 --> 01:19:33.991
<v Speaker 1>and inefficient and dangerous to the the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual world that we live in and we're </v>

1435
01:19:34.271 --> 01:19:39.271
<v Speaker 1>going to start wiping them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the exists right now.</v>

1436
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:43.060
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if that did happen,</v>

1437
01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:48.450
<v Speaker 1>if someone did come to the UN and had </v>
<v Speaker 1>this multistage presentation data that </v>

1438
01:19:50.531 --> 01:19:53.260
<v Speaker 1>showed that if we continue on the path </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going,</v>

1439
01:19:53.261 --> 01:19:58.261
<v Speaker 1>we have seven years before artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence decides to eliminate human </v>

1440
01:19:58.261 --> 01:19:59.380
<v Speaker 1>beings based on these data points.</v>

1441
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:01.180
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they do?</v>

1442
01:20:01.181 --> 01:20:02.740
<v Speaker 1>What are the Boston Dynamics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do?</v>

1443
01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm building a house in Cambridge.</v>

1444
01:20:04.421 --> 01:20:05.470
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>

1445
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1446
01:20:07.921 --> 01:20:10.230
<v Speaker 1>I just bought a new tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to finance this thing.</v>

1447
01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger credit card bills.</v>

1448
01:20:11.771 --> 01:20:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I got student loans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still paying off.</v>

1449
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you stop people from doing what </v>

1450
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.660
<v Speaker 1>they do for a living?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you say that?</v>

1451
01:20:18.661 --> 01:20:23.661
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you would like to look at </v>

1452
01:20:23.661 --> 01:20:26.480
<v Speaker 1>the future with rose colored glasses on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a real potential pitfall </v>

1453
01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:28.980
<v Speaker 1>that could be the extermination of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human species.</v>

1454
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously I'm going way far with </v>

1455
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.070
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1456
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

1457
01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:39.710
<v Speaker 3>I think every one of us trying to build </v>
<v Speaker 3>these systems are similar in sound to </v>

1458
01:20:41.131 --> 01:20:46.131
<v Speaker 3>the way you were talking about the touch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of death in that my dream and the dream </v>

1459
01:20:47.341 --> 01:20:52.341
<v Speaker 3>of many roboticist is to create </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent systems that will improve </v>

1460
01:20:52.411 --> 01:20:57.411
<v Speaker 3>our lives and working really hard at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not for our house in Cambridge,</v>

1461
01:20:59.190 --> 01:21:03.720
<v Speaker 3>not for a billion dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for selling a startup paycheck.</v>

1462
01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:05.310
<v Speaker 3>We love this stuff.</v>

1463
01:21:05.410 --> 01:21:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Some of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously the motivations are </v>

1464
01:21:10.410 --> 01:21:11.860
<v Speaker 1>different for every single human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's involved in every endeavor.</v>

1465
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:16.990
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're trying really hard to build </v>

1466
01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:18.550
<v Speaker 3>these systems and is really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whenever the,</v>

1467
01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.450
<v Speaker 3>the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1468
01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:22.790
<v Speaker 3>this is going to look at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>historically,</v>

1469
01:21:22.791 --> 01:21:26.120
<v Speaker 3>it's going to take off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can potentially take off any moment.</v>

1470
01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:31.540
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to really be </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognizant as an engineer about how it </v>

1471
01:21:33.291 --> 01:21:38.291
<v Speaker 3>takes off because you're trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>it take off in a positive direction and </v>

1472
01:21:38.291 --> 01:21:40.340
<v Speaker 3>you're failing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody is failing.</v>

1473
01:21:40.341 --> 01:21:45.341
<v Speaker 3>It's been really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you have to acknowledge that </v>

1474
01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:47.990
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that overnight,</v>

1475
01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:53.060
<v Speaker 3>some Ilan Musk type character might come</v>
<v Speaker 3>along and you know,</v>

1476
01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:55.550
<v Speaker 3>people with this boring company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1477
01:21:55.551 --> 01:22:00.551
<v Speaker 3>or with space x,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people didn't think anybody but NASA </v>

1478
01:22:00.551 --> 01:22:00.800
<v Speaker 3>could do what he's doing and he's doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1479
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.270
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to think about that too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to do that.</v>

1480
01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:10.600
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>create these super intelligent beings.</v>

1481
01:22:11.710 --> 01:22:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't the reality also that we have </v>

1482
01:22:16.710 --> 01:22:16.990
<v Speaker 1>done things in the past because we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do it.</v>

1483
01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:20.860
<v Speaker 1>And then we realized that these have </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific consequences for the human race</v>

1484
01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:23.440
<v Speaker 1>like Oppenheimer and the Manhattan </v>
<v Speaker 1>project.</v>

1485
01:22:23.770 --> 01:22:24.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he said,</v>

1486
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:28.360
<v Speaker 1>I am death destroy one destroyer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>worlds.</v>

1487
01:22:28.361 --> 01:22:30.340
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was quoting the Bhagavad Gita,</v>

1488
01:22:30.670 --> 01:22:34.660
<v Speaker 1>when he's detonating the first nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>bomb and realizing what he's done,</v>

1489
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:40.110
<v Speaker 1>just because something's possible to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't necessarily mean it's a good </v>

1490
01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:43.471
<v Speaker 1>idea for human beings to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we haven't destroyed the world with </v>

1491
01:22:43.471 --> 01:22:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Oppenheimer's discovery and through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>work of the Manhattan project,</v>

1492
01:22:45.911 --> 01:22:50.911
<v Speaker 1>we've managed to somehow or another keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lid on this shit for the last </v>

1493
01:22:50.911 --> 01:22:50.911
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy,</v>

1494
01:22:50.911 --> 01:22:52.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1495
01:22:52.001 --> 01:22:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean for the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1496
01:22:53.471 --> 01:22:55.210
<v Speaker 1>70 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long has it been?</v>

1497
01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Seven days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds right.</v>

1498
01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:57.950
<v Speaker 1>$10,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$20,000.</v>

1499
01:22:57.951 --> 01:23:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Nukes all over the world right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1500
01:23:00.221 --> 01:23:05.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we literally could kill everything on </v>

1501
01:23:05.221 --> 01:23:05.500
<v Speaker 1>the planet and somehow we would not </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow,</v>

1502
01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:09.460
<v Speaker 1>somehow in some amazing way we have not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean we.</v>

1503
01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:14.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean this a very short amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>in relation to the actual lifespan of </v>

1504
01:23:15.821 --> 01:23:20.821
<v Speaker 1>the earth itself and certainly in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the time human history has been </v>

1505
01:23:20.821 --> 01:23:20.821
<v Speaker 1>around</v>

1506
01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:26.300
<v Speaker 3>and nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Global warming is another one.</v>

1507
01:23:27.190 --> 01:23:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a side effect of our actions,</v>

1508
01:23:29.231 --> 01:23:34.231
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a direct effect of </v>

1509
01:23:34.231 --> 01:23:35.800
<v Speaker 1>human ingenuity and innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nuclear bomb,</v>

1510
01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a direct effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We tried to make it,</v>

1511
01:23:38.591 --> 01:23:39.870
<v Speaker 1>we made it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it goes.</v>

1512
01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Global warming's an accidental </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of human civilization,</v>

1513
01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:49.650
<v Speaker 3>so you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's possible to not build</v>

1514
01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:50.710
<v Speaker 3>a nuclear bomb.</v>

1515
01:23:51.670 --> 01:23:54.610
<v Speaker 1>You don't think it's possible to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>build it in terms of.</v>

1516
01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Because people are tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they speak different languages,</v>

1517
01:23:56.891 --> 01:23:59.830
<v Speaker 1>they have different desires and needs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were add more.</v>

1518
01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:02.380
<v Speaker 1>So if all these engineers were working </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards it,</v>

1519
01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:04.780
<v Speaker 1>it was not possible to not build it.</v>

1520
01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

1521
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:11.390
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something about us chimps in a </v>

1522
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.520
<v Speaker 3>large collective where we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1523
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:14.970
<v Speaker 3>are born and push forward towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>progress of technology.</v>

1524
01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:17.760
<v Speaker 3>You cannot stop the progress of </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>

1525
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000
<v Speaker 3>So the goal is to how to develop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to guide that development into a </v>

1526
01:24:23.131 --> 01:24:23.970
<v Speaker 3>positive direction.</v>

1527
01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Surely if we do understand that this has</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken place and we did drop these </v>

1528
01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:35.260
<v Speaker 1>enormous bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki</v>
<v Speaker 1>and killed untold amounts of innocent </v>

1529
01:24:36.891 --> 01:24:41.891
<v Speaker 1>people with these detonations that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily always a good thing to </v>

1530
01:24:43.101 --> 01:24:44.270
<v Speaker 1>pursue technology</v>

1531
01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:46.410
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody is.</v>

1532
01:24:46.530 --> 01:24:47.070
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1533
01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:51.030
<v Speaker 1>you see what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with your total.</v>

1534
01:24:51.190 --> 01:24:53.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm more playing devil's advocate than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

1535
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:58.830
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying is you guys are looking </v>

1536
01:24:58.830 --> 01:25:01.031
<v Speaker 1>at these things like we're just trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make these things happen and what I </v>

1537
01:25:01.031 --> 01:25:04.871
<v Speaker 1>think people like Elon Musk and Sam </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harris and a bunch of others that are </v>

1538
01:25:04.871 --> 01:25:08.770
<v Speaker 1>gravely concerned about the potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>for ai are saying is that I understand </v>

1539
01:25:09.351 --> 01:25:14.351
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to understand the other </v>

1540
01:25:14.351 --> 01:25:17.411
<v Speaker 1>side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to understand that there are </v>

1541
01:25:17.411 --> 01:25:17.420
<v Speaker 1>people out there that are terrified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you do extrapolate,</v>

1542
01:25:17.421 --> 01:25:22.421
<v Speaker 1>if you do take this relentless thirst </v>
<v Speaker 1>for innovation and keep going with it,</v>

1543
01:25:24.010 --> 01:25:29.010
<v Speaker 1>when you look at what we can do so what </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings can do so far in our crude </v>

1544
01:25:29.331 --> 01:25:34.040
<v Speaker 1>manner of 2018 will all the amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things they've been able to accomplish.</v>

1545
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:38.630
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible that we might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating our successors.</v>

1546
01:25:38.690 --> 01:25:43.690
<v Speaker 1>This is not outside the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility and all of our biological </v>

1547
01:25:43.690 --> 01:25:47.351
<v Speaker 1>limitations might be we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might figure out a better way and </v>

1548
01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:50.570
<v Speaker 1>this better way might be some sort of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial creature.</v>

1549
01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:56.380
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ai began with our dream to forge the </v>

1550
01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:59.141
<v Speaker 3>gods and that's I would like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's impossible to stop.</v>

1551
01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible to stop if you go Ted </v>

1552
01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski and kill all the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1553
01:26:06.291 --> 01:26:08.870
<v Speaker 1>that's what Ted Kaczynski anticipated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1554
01:26:08.871 --> 01:26:12.170
<v Speaker 1>the unibomber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the whole story behind him know</v>

1555
01:26:12.171 --> 01:26:14.720
<v Speaker 1>what was he trying to stop who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating cat.</v>

1556
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a bunch of fascinating things </v>

1557
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:21.851
<v Speaker 1>about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the more fascinating things </v>

1558
01:26:21.851 --> 01:26:23.561
<v Speaker 1>about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was involved in the Harvard lsd </v>

1559
01:26:23.561 --> 01:26:26.201
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they were nuke in that dude's brain </v>

1560
01:26:26.201 --> 01:26:27.830
<v Speaker 1>with acid and then he goes to Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a professor,</v>

1561
01:26:27.831 --> 01:26:32.831
<v Speaker 1>takes all this money from teaching and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just makes a cabin in the woods and </v>

1562
01:26:32.831 --> 01:26:36.110
<v Speaker 1>decides to kill people that are involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the creation of technology because he</v>

1563
01:26:36.111 --> 01:26:39.050
<v Speaker 1>thinks technology is eventually going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill off all the people.</v>

1564
01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:44.440
<v Speaker 1>So he becomes crazy and schizophrenia </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick and who knows what the fuck is </v>

1565
01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:47.480
<v Speaker 1>wrong with them and whether or not this </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have taken place inevitably,</v>

1566
01:26:47.630 --> 01:26:52.630
<v Speaker 1>or whether this was a direct result of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his being literally like drowned in Lsd.</v>

1567
01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:58.450
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know how much they gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>him or what the experiment entailed or </v>

1568
01:26:58.450 --> 01:27:00.280
<v Speaker 1>how many other people's gut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their brain torched during these uh,</v>

1569
01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:05.380
<v Speaker 1>experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we do know for a fact that Ted </v>

1570
01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski was a part of the Harvard lsd </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies.</v>

1571
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:10.810
<v Speaker 1>And we do know that he went and did move</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the woods and write his manifesto and</v>

1572
01:27:11.781 --> 01:27:14.960
<v Speaker 1>start blowing up people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in technology.</v>

1573
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:20.110
<v Speaker 3>And the basic thesis of his manifesto </v>
<v Speaker 3>that perhaps Lsd,</v>

1574
01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:22.940
<v Speaker 3>he opened his eyes to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that technology is gonna,</v>

1575
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:25.790
<v Speaker 3>kill all humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we should.</v>

1576
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.260
<v Speaker 3>It was gonna be the end of the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>race,</v>

1577
01:27:27.261 --> 01:27:32.261
<v Speaker 3>I think you may believe human race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they know what it is that what he </v>

1578
01:27:32.261 --> 01:27:32.890
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will get into industrial,</v>

1579
01:27:32.891 --> 01:27:33.920
<v Speaker 3>Rachel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

1580
01:27:33.970 --> 01:27:38.970
<v Speaker 3>the industrial revolution and its </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences have been a disaster for </v>

1581
01:27:38.970 --> 01:27:38.970
<v Speaker 3>the human race.</v>

1582
01:27:38.970 --> 01:27:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He extrapolated.</v>

1583
01:27:40.330 --> 01:27:45.330
<v Speaker 1>He was looking at where we're going and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that were responsible for </v>

1584
01:27:45.330 --> 01:27:49.411
<v Speaker 1>innovation and he was saying they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this with no regard for the </v>

1585
01:27:49.411 --> 01:27:52.681
<v Speaker 1>consequences on the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he thought the way to stop that was </v>

1586
01:27:52.681 --> 01:27:54.190
<v Speaker 1>to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he's fucking demented,</v>

1587
01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:59.700
<v Speaker 1>but this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he literally was saying what </v>

1588
01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:01.630
<v Speaker 1>we're saying right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep going,</v>

1589
01:28:01.631 --> 01:28:02.350
<v Speaker 1>we're fucked.</v>

1590
01:28:02.770 --> 01:28:06.090
<v Speaker 3>So the industrial revolution have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about that.</v>

1591
01:28:06.110 --> 01:28:08.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a really important message coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the wrong guy.</v>

1592
01:28:08.501 --> 01:28:12.790
<v Speaker 3>But where is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's all of this?</v>

1593
01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Taking us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1594
01:28:13.931 --> 01:28:18.931
<v Speaker 3>Where is it taste?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I guess my underlying assumption is </v>

1595
01:28:18.931 --> 01:28:22.801
<v Speaker 3>the journey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the current capitalist structure of </v>

1596
01:28:22.801 --> 01:28:25.081
<v Speaker 3>society that we always want a new iphone</v>
<v Speaker 3>just had a one of the best reviewers on </v>

1597
01:28:26.411 --> 01:28:28.750
<v Speaker 3>yesterday that always talks about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marcus.</v>

1598
01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:29.400
<v Speaker 3>Marcus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1599
01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:32.890
<v Speaker 3>We always myself to pixel three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a pixel to.</v>

1600
01:28:32.891 --> 01:28:33.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1601
01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:37.330
<v Speaker 3>maybe I needed a pixel three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know a better camera.</v>

1602
01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:41.380
<v Speaker 3>You know that whatever that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fire that wants more butter,</v>

1603
01:28:41.381 --> 01:28:46.381
<v Speaker 3>butter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think it's possible to </v>

1604
01:28:46.381 --> 01:28:49.111
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the best thing we can do is to </v>

1605
01:28:49.111 --> 01:28:51.790
<v Speaker 3>explore ways to guided towards safety </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it helps us.</v>

1606
01:28:51.970 --> 01:28:55.840
<v Speaker 1>When you say it's not possible to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean collectively as an organism,</v>

1607
01:28:55.841 --> 01:29:00.841
<v Speaker 1>like the human race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a tendency that's just built </v>

1608
01:29:00.841 --> 01:29:03.271
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly possible stop as an </v>

1609
01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:05.551
<v Speaker 1>individual because I know people like my</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend Ari who's given up on </v>

1610
01:29:05.551 --> 01:29:09.450
<v Speaker 1>smartphones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went to a flip phone and he doesn't </v>

1611
01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:10.470
<v Speaker 1>check social media anymore and he found </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to be toxic.</v>

1612
01:29:10.471 --> 01:29:13.440
<v Speaker 1>He didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was too addicted to it and</v>

1613
01:29:13.441 --> 01:29:15.360
<v Speaker 1>he didn't like where it was leading him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1614
01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.580
<v Speaker 1>So in front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On an individual level,</v>

1615
01:29:17.581 --> 01:29:18.060
<v Speaker 1>it's possible</v>

1616
01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:23.420
<v Speaker 3>individual level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then and just like with Ted </v>

1617
01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Kaczynski and the individual level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's possible to do certain things that </v>

1618
01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:29.250
<v Speaker 3>tried to stop at a more dramatic ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just think the force of our.</v>

1619
01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:33.120
<v Speaker 3>This symbiotic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this organism that's just this living,</v>

1620
01:29:33.121 --> 01:29:36.600
<v Speaker 3>breathing organism that is our </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization will progress forward.</v>

1621
01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:39.240
<v Speaker 3>We're just curious apes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1622
01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:43.110
<v Speaker 3>it's this desire to explore the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

1623
01:29:43.410 --> 01:29:45.600
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do we want to do these things?</v>

1624
01:29:45.601 --> 01:29:50.130
<v Speaker 3>Why do we look up and we want to travel </v>
<v Speaker 3>and and it's not.</v>

1625
01:29:50.131 --> 01:29:53.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's sort of a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to optimize for survival.</v>

1626
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:59.000
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think most of us would want to </v>

1627
01:29:59.000 --> 01:29:59.000
<v Speaker 3>be immortal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1628
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.400
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like Neil degrasse Tyson </v>
<v Speaker 3>talks about the fact that we're mortal.</v>

1629
01:30:02.401 --> 01:30:07.401
<v Speaker 3>The fact that one day we'll die is one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the things that gives life meaning </v>

1630
01:30:07.401 --> 01:30:10.710
<v Speaker 3>and sort of trying to worry and trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to sort of say,</v>

1631
01:30:10.711 --> 01:30:12.150
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's this going?</v>

1632
01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:17.420
<v Speaker 3>As opposed to riding the wave and doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>riding the wave of,</v>

1633
01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:20.150
<v Speaker 3>of forward progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1634
01:30:20.151 --> 01:30:22.920
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the things he gets quite a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit of.</v>

1635
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:27.950
<v Speaker 3>Ironically hate for Steve Pinker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he really described in data how our </v>

1636
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:28.800
<v Speaker 3>world is getting better and better with</v>

1637
01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:34.500
<v Speaker 1>hate from people that don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>admit that there's a trend towards </v>

1638
01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:38.230
<v Speaker 1>things getting better because they feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like then people will ignore all the bad</v>

1639
01:30:38.231 --> 01:30:43.231
<v Speaker 1>things that are happening right now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the injustices which I think is a </v>

1640
01:30:43.231 --> 01:30:44.020
<v Speaker 1>very short sided thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's because of their own,</v>

1641
01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:49.740
<v Speaker 1>their own biases and the perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're trying to establish and </v>

1642
01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:54.721
<v Speaker 1>push instead of looking at things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>objectives and looking at the date and </v>

1643
01:30:54.721 --> 01:30:54.721
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1644
01:30:54.721 --> 01:30:58.951
<v Speaker 1>I see where you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't discount the fact that </v>

1645
01:30:58.951 --> 01:31:01.411
<v Speaker 1>there's injustice in the world and crime</v>
<v Speaker 1>and violence and all sorts of terrible </v>

1646
01:31:01.411 --> 01:31:02.350
<v Speaker 1>things happen to people that are good </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on a daily basis,</v>

1647
01:31:02.890 --> 01:31:07.890
<v Speaker 1>but what he's saying is just look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual trend of civilization and the </v>

1648
01:31:08.621 --> 01:31:13.621
<v Speaker 1>human species itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's an undeniable trend towards </v>

1649
01:31:13.621 --> 01:31:16.510
<v Speaker 1>peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slowly but surely working towards peace.</v>

1650
01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Way Safer today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way Safer today than it was a thousand </v>

1651
01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:21.780
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just it is.</v>

1652
01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:22.050
<v Speaker 1>It just did.</v>

1653
01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:27.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's these interesting arguments </v>

1654
01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:28.870
<v Speaker 3>which his book kind of blew my mind to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this funny joke.</v>

1655
01:31:28.871 --> 01:31:31.690
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people considered given nuclear,</v>

1656
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:37.390
<v Speaker 3>the atom bomb the Nobel Peace Prize </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he believes I'm not an expert in</v>

1657
01:31:38.141 --> 01:31:43.141
<v Speaker 3>this at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he believes that sort of or some </v>

1658
01:31:43.141 --> 01:31:44.971
<v Speaker 3>people believe that nuclear weapons are </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually responsible for a lot of the </v>

1659
01:31:44.971 --> 01:31:47.830
<v Speaker 3>decrease in violence because all of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>major people can do damage.</v>

1660
01:31:47.831 --> 01:31:51.280
<v Speaker 3>All the Russia and all the major states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you do damage,</v>

1661
01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:54.720
<v Speaker 3>have a strong disincentive from engaging</v>
<v Speaker 3>in warfare.</v>

1662
01:31:55.090 --> 01:31:57.270
<v Speaker 3>And so these are the kinds of things you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

1663
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:59.450
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anticipate and say.</v>

1664
01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:04.680
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to stop that for </v>

1665
01:32:05.151 --> 01:32:10.151
<v Speaker 3>progress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have to really worry and think </v>

1666
01:32:10.151 --> 01:32:10.151
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1667
01:32:10.151 --> 01:32:11.470
<v Speaker 3>how do we avoid the list of things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we worry about?</v>

1668
01:32:11.890 --> 01:32:16.890
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that people really </v>
<v Speaker 3>worry about is the control problem is </v>

1669
01:32:16.890 --> 01:32:20.851
<v Speaker 3>basically ai becoming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily super intelligent but </v>

1670
01:32:20.851 --> 01:32:22.570
<v Speaker 3>super powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but too much of our lives into it.</v>

1671
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:27.990
<v Speaker 3>That's where Elon Musk and others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to provide regulation of some </v>

1672
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:27.990
<v Speaker 3>sort saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

1673
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:33.630
<v Speaker 3>you have to put some bars on what this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing can do from a government </v>

1674
01:32:33.630 --> 01:32:33.630
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a company perspective,</v>

1675
01:32:33.630 --> 01:32:34.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how</v>

1676
01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.560
<v Speaker 1>could you stop rogue states from doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1677
01:32:36.890 --> 01:32:38.210
<v Speaker 1>How could you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you,</v>

1678
01:32:38.211 --> 01:32:40.940
<v Speaker 1>why would China listen to us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would Russia listen to us?</v>

1679
01:32:40.941 --> 01:32:45.941
<v Speaker 1>Why would other countries that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of doing this and maybe don't </v>

1680
01:32:45.941 --> 01:32:47.960
<v Speaker 1>have the same sort of power that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States has and they would like to</v>

1681
01:32:47.961 --> 01:32:51.680
<v Speaker 1>establish that kind of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't they just take the cap off</v>

1682
01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:55.150
<v Speaker 3>in philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high level sense?</v>

1683
01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:57.610
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you engineered in.</v>

1684
01:32:58.030 --> 01:33:03.030
<v Speaker 3>So I'm a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll do this thing with autonomous </v>

1685
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:06.511
<v Speaker 3>vehicles called arguing machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have multiple AI systems argue </v>

1686
01:33:06.511 --> 01:33:07.640
<v Speaker 3>against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1687
01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:12.740
<v Speaker 3>it's possible that you'll have some ai </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems over supervising other AI </v>

1688
01:33:12.881 --> 01:33:15.420
<v Speaker 3>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So have a sort of,</v>

1689
01:33:15.421 --> 01:33:16.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1690
01:33:16.121 --> 01:33:16.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our,</v>

1691
01:33:16.901 --> 01:33:19.390
<v Speaker 3>in our nation there's a congress </v>
<v Speaker 3>arguing,</v>

1692
01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:24.640
<v Speaker 3>blue and red states being represented in</v>
<v Speaker 3>as this discourse going on debate and </v>

1693
01:33:25.031 --> 01:33:30.031
<v Speaker 3>have ai systems like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even necessarily need to be </v>

1694
01:33:30.031 --> 01:33:32.620
<v Speaker 3>one super powerful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be ai supervising each other,</v>

1695
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:37.950
<v Speaker 3>so there's this interesting ideas there </v>
<v Speaker 3>too to play with because ultimately what</v>

1696
01:33:38.711 --> 01:33:40.840
<v Speaker 3>are these artificial intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems doing?</v>

1697
01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:45.520
<v Speaker 3>We humans place power into their hands </v>
<v Speaker 3>first in order for them to run away with</v>

1698
01:33:45.521 --> 01:33:47.800
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to put power into their hands,</v>

1699
01:33:48.010 --> 01:33:53.010
<v Speaker 3>so we'll have to figure out how we put </v>
<v Speaker 3>that power in initially so it doesn't </v>

1700
01:33:53.010 --> 01:33:53.650
<v Speaker 3>run away and how supervision can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1701
01:33:53.651 --> 01:33:54.140
<v Speaker 3>but this is</v>

1702
01:33:54.210 --> 01:33:56.550
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about rational people.</v>

1703
01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:59.720
<v Speaker 1>What about other people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they engineer limitations into</v>

1704
01:33:59.721 --> 01:34:04.721
<v Speaker 1>their artificial intelligence and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive would they have to do that to </v>

1705
01:34:04.721 --> 01:34:08.451
<v Speaker 1>somehow another limit their artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence to keep it from having as </v>

1706
01:34:08.451 --> 01:34:10.410
<v Speaker 1>much power as ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's really not a lot of incentive on</v>

1707
01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:15.420
<v Speaker 1>their side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if there's some sort of </v>

1708
01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:17.751
<v Speaker 1>competitive advantage for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence to be more </v>

1709
01:34:17.751 --> 01:34:17.751
<v Speaker 1>ruthless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more sentient,</v>

1710
01:34:17.751 --> 01:34:19.450
<v Speaker 1>more autonomous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>

1711
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:23.640
<v Speaker 1>It seems like once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once the genie's out of the bottle,</v>

1712
01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:26.580
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a theory,</v>

1713
01:34:26.730 --> 01:34:31.730
<v Speaker 1>and this is a very bizarre theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been running with this for </v>

1714
01:34:31.730 --> 01:34:34.880
<v Speaker 1>quite a few years now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think human beings are some sort of a </v>

1715
01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:37.731
<v Speaker 1>caterpillar and I think we're creating a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocoon and through that cocoon we're </v>

1716
01:34:37.731 --> 01:34:40.560
<v Speaker 1>going to give birth to a butterfly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to become something and</v>

1717
01:34:40.561 --> 01:34:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I think we're whether we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some sort of a symbiotic connection</v>

1718
01:34:44.761 --> 01:34:47.060
<v Speaker 1>to these electronic things where they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to replace our.</v>

1719
01:34:47.310 --> 01:34:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Our parts are failing parts with far </v>
<v Speaker 1>superior parts until we're not really a </v>

1720
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:56.751
<v Speaker 1>person anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what was that scarlet Johannson </v>

1721
01:34:56.751 --> 01:34:56.820
<v Speaker 1>movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ghost in the shell.</v>

1722
01:34:57.530 --> 01:34:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I tried to watch part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty stupid,</v>

1723
01:34:59.630 --> 01:35:04.630
<v Speaker 1>but she's hot as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it kept my attention for a little </v>

1724
01:35:04.630 --> 01:35:07.271
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in that they took her brain and put </v>

1725
01:35:07.271 --> 01:35:10.301
<v Speaker 1>it in this artificial body that was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>had super powers and they basically </v>

1726
01:35:10.941 --> 01:35:15.941
<v Speaker 1>replaced everything about her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't her consciousness with these</v>

1727
01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.330
<v Speaker 1>artificial parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gerd,</v>

1728
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:25.390
<v Speaker 1>oliver frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was just some new thing that </v>

1729
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:29.471
<v Speaker 1>was far superior and she had these </v>
<v Speaker 1>abilities that no human being will ever </v>

1730
01:35:29.471 --> 01:35:33.221
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really wonder why we have this </v>

1731
01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:34.880
<v Speaker 1>insatiable thirst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we,</v>

1732
01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:39.900
<v Speaker 1>if we're so logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're so logical and so thoughtful in </v>

1733
01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:43.781
<v Speaker 1>some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we be that way when it comes </v>

1734
01:35:43.781 --> 01:35:43.781
<v Speaker 1>to materialism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1735
01:35:43.781 --> 01:35:47.111
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the reasons why is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because materialism is the main engine </v>

1736
01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:48.650
<v Speaker 1>that pushes innovation.</v>

1737
01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:51.560
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for people's desire to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the newest,</v>

1738
01:35:51.561 --> 01:35:56.180
<v Speaker 1>latest and greatest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would fund these new tvs?</v>

1739
01:35:56.181 --> 01:35:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Cell phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>computers.</v>

1740
01:35:57.741 --> 01:36:02.741
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you really need a new laptop </v>

1741
01:36:02.741 --> 01:36:02.741
<v Speaker 1>every year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it because of engineered obsolescence</v>

1742
01:36:02.741 --> 01:36:06.320
<v Speaker 1>where the laptop dies off and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a new one because they fucked you</v>

1743
01:36:06.321 --> 01:36:09.110
<v Speaker 1>and they built a shitty machine that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to die.</v>

1744
01:36:09.111 --> 01:36:11.550
<v Speaker 1>So you buy a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really like iphone is done.</v>

1745
01:36:11.551 --> 01:36:12.260
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1746
01:36:12.261 --> 01:36:13.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not even an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So laptop.</v>

1747
01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

1748
01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:18.440
<v Speaker 1>It is it because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1749
01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:23.120
<v Speaker 1>you just see the number two point six </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gigahertz is better than two point four.</v>

1750
01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the new one.</v>

1751
01:36:24.321 --> 01:36:27.770
<v Speaker 1>It has a 12 megapixel webcam instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>an eight,</v>

1752
01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:32.030
<v Speaker 1>and for whatever reason we have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to get those new things.</v>

1753
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:37.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what fuels innovation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my cynical view of this thing that's </v>

1754
01:36:38.811 --> 01:36:43.811
<v Speaker 1>happening is that we have this bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to fuel our demise and that we're</v>

1755
01:36:45.531 --> 01:36:49.130
<v Speaker 1>doing so by fueling technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

1756
01:36:49.190 --> 01:36:53.390
<v Speaker 1>by motivating these companies to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually innovate,</v>

1757
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:54.970
<v Speaker 1>know if everybody just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1758
01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:59.980
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really in the log cabins and I want </v>

1759
01:36:59.980 --> 01:36:59.980
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1760
01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:00.350
<v Speaker 1>an ax or cut my own firewood.</v>

1761
01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:04.910
<v Speaker 1>And I realized that TV's rot my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to read books so fuck off.</v>

1762
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:07.870
<v Speaker 1>And everybody started doing that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody started living in like,</v>

1763
01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:10.880
<v Speaker 1>when it gets dark out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll use candles and you know what?</v>

1764
01:37:10.881 --> 01:37:13.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get my water from a well </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what I'm going to do.</v>

1765
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:17.150
<v Speaker 1>And I like living better that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people started doing that,</v>

1766
01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:22.660
<v Speaker 1>there would be no need for companies to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually make new computers to make </v>

1767
01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:25.700
<v Speaker 1>new phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make new smartwatches or whatever the</v>

1768
01:37:25.701 --> 01:37:28.130
<v Speaker 1>fuck they're they're making to make cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can drive themselves.</v>

1769
01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:31.820
<v Speaker 1>These things that were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were really,</v>

1770
01:37:31.821 --> 01:37:35.570
<v Speaker 1>really attached to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you looked at the human organism,</v>

1771
01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:40.640
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've somehow or another could </v>

1772
01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:41.751
<v Speaker 1>objective really remove yourself from </v>
<v Speaker 1>society and culture and all the things </v>

1773
01:37:43.161 --> 01:37:46.070
<v Speaker 1>that make us a person and you look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do,</v>

1774
01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:48.560
<v Speaker 1>like what does this thing do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We found this planet,</v>

1775
01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:52.190
<v Speaker 1>there's these little pink monkeys and </v>
<v Speaker 1>brown monkeys and yellow monkeys,</v>

1776
01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:53.750
<v Speaker 1>and what do they all into?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1777
01:37:53.751 --> 01:37:57.480
<v Speaker 1>they all seem to be into making stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what kind of stuff were they making?</v>

1778
01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they keep making better and better </v>

1779
01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:02.660
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more and more capable.</v>

1780
01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's it going?</v>

1781
01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:06.620
<v Speaker 1>What's going to replace them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to make a thing that's </v>

1782
01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:06.620
<v Speaker 1>better than them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to their,</v>

1783
01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:07.650
<v Speaker 1>their engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things.</v>

1784
01:38:07.651 --> 01:38:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Slowly but surely to do all the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do,</v>

1785
01:38:11.190 --> 01:38:12.060
<v Speaker 1>but do them better.</v>

1786
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a fascinating theory.</v>

1787
01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:17.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a theory.</v>

1788
01:38:17.461 --> 01:38:22.461
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an instructive way to think about </v>

1789
01:38:22.461 --> 01:38:22.590
<v Speaker 2>intelligence in life period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you step back,</v>

1790
01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:27.980
<v Speaker 2>look across human history and look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth is an organism like what is this </v>

1791
01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:29.160
<v Speaker 2>thing doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>

1792
01:38:29.161 --> 01:38:30.330
<v Speaker 2>I think at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

1793
01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:34.290
<v Speaker 2>in terms of scale and in terms of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can look that way.</v>

1794
01:38:34.291 --> 01:38:39.291
<v Speaker 2>It's so many things like isn't there </v>
<v Speaker 2>billions or trillions of organisms on </v>

1795
01:38:39.291 --> 01:38:40.700
<v Speaker 2>our skin right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of us that are,</v>

1796
01:38:40.710 --> 01:38:42.450
<v Speaker 2>have little civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1797
01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:45.630
<v Speaker 2>They have a different mechanism by which</v>
<v Speaker 2>they operate and interact.</v>

1798
01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:51.080
<v Speaker 2>But for us to say that we're intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those organisms or not is a very </v>

1799
01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:55.311
<v Speaker 2>narrow sighted view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they are operating under some force </v>

1800
01:38:55.311 --> 01:38:55.710
<v Speaker 2>of nature that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1801
01:38:55.711 --> 01:39:00.711
<v Speaker 2>that the Darwin has worked on trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand some small elements of this </v>

1802
01:39:00.711 --> 01:39:01.170
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary theory.</v>

1803
01:39:01.170 --> 01:39:04.530
<v Speaker 2>But there's other more interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces at play that we don't understand.</v>

1804
01:39:04.890 --> 01:39:09.890
<v Speaker 2>And there's some kind of force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be a fundamental force of </v>

1805
01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:13.701
<v Speaker 2>physics that Einstein never got a chance</v>
<v Speaker 2>to discover is our desire for an iphone </v>

1806
01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:18.780
<v Speaker 2>update some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some fundamental force of nature.</v>

1807
01:39:19.090 --> 01:39:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Somehow gravity in the strong force in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things described by physics add up</v>

1808
01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:28.580
<v Speaker 2>to this drive for new things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for creation.</v>

1809
01:39:30.150 --> 01:39:31.950
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we die,</v>

1810
01:39:32.670 --> 01:39:35.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the fact that we're mortal.</v>

1811
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:39.810
<v Speaker 2>The fact that what desires a built in to</v>
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>

1812
01:39:39.870 --> 01:39:43.500
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a sexual or intellectual or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever drives us,</v>

1813
01:39:43.501 --> 01:39:46.470
<v Speaker 2>apes like somehow that all combines to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1814
01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:52.460
<v Speaker 2>to this progress and towards what it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a compelling way to think that if an </v>

1815
01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:57.171
<v Speaker 2>alien species did visit Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they would probably see the </v>

1816
01:39:57.171 --> 01:40:01.581
<v Speaker 2>smartphone situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see how many little lights are on </v>

1817
01:40:01.581 --> 01:40:03.300
<v Speaker 2>and how us apes are looking at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>

1818
01:40:03.301 --> 01:40:08.301
<v Speaker 2>I think some people have said that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would think the overlords are the </v>

1819
01:40:08.301 --> 01:40:08.301
<v Speaker 2>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the people.</v>

1820
01:40:08.490 --> 01:40:13.490
<v Speaker 2>So to think that that's now moving into </v>
<v Speaker 2>a direction where the future will be </v>

1821
01:40:14.011 --> 01:40:18.630
<v Speaker 2>something that is beyond human or survey</v>
<v Speaker 2>article.</v>

1822
01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Human ways we can't understand it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting.</v>

1823
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Not just that,</v>

1824
01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.360
<v Speaker 1>but something that we're creating </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves,</v>

1825
01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:26.530
<v Speaker 1>grading ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a,</v>

1826
01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:31.420
<v Speaker 1>a main focal point of our existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our purpose.</v>

1827
01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1828
01:40:32.111 --> 01:40:35.730
<v Speaker 1>if you think about a main focal point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about the,</v>

1829
01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:38.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average person,</v>

1830
01:40:38.201 --> 01:40:43.201
<v Speaker 1>what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a great percentage of our </v>

1831
01:40:43.201 --> 01:40:47.101
<v Speaker 1>population that has jobs where they work</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the ways that they placate </v>

1832
01:40:48.371 --> 01:40:53.371
<v Speaker 1>themselves doing these things that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really enjoy doing is earning </v>

1833
01:40:53.371 --> 01:40:54.600
<v Speaker 1>money for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1834
01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:57.370
<v Speaker 1>They want a new car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want a new house,</v>

1835
01:40:57.371 --> 01:40:59.950
<v Speaker 1>they want a bigger TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted this or that.</v>

1836
01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:05.160
<v Speaker 1>And the way they motivate themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep showing up at this shitty job is to</v>

1837
01:41:05.351 --> 01:41:08.440
<v Speaker 1>think if I just put in three more </v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

1838
01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I can get that Mercedes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I just do this or that or that,</v>

1839
01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:12.970
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1840
01:41:12.971 --> 01:41:14.560
<v Speaker 1>I can finance this new pixel</v>

1841
01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:16.430
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1842
01:41:16.431 --> 01:41:20.420
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting because it's sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of politicians,</v>

1843
01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:23.330
<v Speaker 2>what's the American dream is for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

1844
01:41:23.331 --> 01:41:25.580
<v Speaker 2>This thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want my children to be better off than</v>

1845
01:41:25.581 --> 01:41:27.480
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of desire,</v>

1846
01:41:27.650 --> 01:41:32.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can almost see that that taken </v>

1847
01:41:32.650 --> 01:41:34.110
<v Speaker 2>farther and farther will be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be a presidential candidate and</v>

1848
01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:35.750
<v Speaker 2>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years they'll say,</v>

1849
01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:40.890
<v Speaker 2>I want my children to be robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what I mean?</v>

1850
01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:45.900
<v Speaker 2>Like sort of this idea that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural evolution and that is the </v>

1851
01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:50.771
<v Speaker 2>highest calling of our species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That scares me because I value my own </v>

1852
01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:51.910
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but does it</v>

1853
01:41:52.050 --> 01:41:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Gary you if if it comes out perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if each robot is like a god in each</v>

1854
01:41:58.081 --> 01:42:03.081
<v Speaker 1>robot is beautiful and loving and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>they recognize all the great parts of </v>

1855
01:42:03.081 --> 01:42:07.461
<v Speaker 1>this existence and they avoid all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>jealousy and the nonsense and all the </v>

1856
01:42:07.461 --> 01:42:12.071
<v Speaker 1>stupid aspects of being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We realized that a lot of these things </v>

1857
01:42:12.071 --> 01:42:15.171
<v Speaker 1>are just sort of biological engineered </v>
<v Speaker 1>tricks that are designed to keep us </v>

1858
01:42:15.691 --> 01:42:17.970
<v Speaker 1>surviving from generation after </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>

1859
01:42:17.971 --> 01:42:22.620
<v Speaker 1>but now here in this fantastic new age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't need them anymore.</v>

1860
01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1861
01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Well first one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformative moments of my life was </v>

1862
01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:35.051
<v Speaker 2>when I met spot many in person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the legged robots in </v>

1863
01:42:35.051 --> 01:42:37.100
<v Speaker 2>Boston dynamics for the first time when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I met them,</v>

1864
01:42:38.290 --> 01:42:42.860
<v Speaker 2>my meant that little fella there was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly how it works.</v>

1865
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:45.230
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly how every aspect of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

1866
01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:50.260
<v Speaker 2>It's just a dumb robot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I met him and he got up and he </v>

1867
01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:51.140
<v Speaker 2>looked at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is right there.</v>

1868
01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen a dance now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1869
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:57.800
<v Speaker 2>The dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dance is crazy.</v>

1870
01:42:58.440 --> 01:42:59.660
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1871
01:42:59.750 --> 01:43:03.140
<v Speaker 2>It's not crazy on the technical side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's engineered.</v>

1872
01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.820
<v Speaker 2>It's obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's programmed,</v>

1873
01:43:04.821 --> 01:43:06.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's crazy to watch like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1874
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:11.830
<v Speaker 2>there's something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason that moment was </v>

1875
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:13.721
<v Speaker 2>transformative because I know exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>how it works and yet by watching it </v>

1876
01:43:13.721 --> 01:43:15.050
<v Speaker 2>something about the feeling of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1877
01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:20.080
<v Speaker 2>this thing is alive and there was this </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying moment.</v>

1878
01:43:20.210 --> 01:43:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Not Terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying and appealing.</v>

1879
01:43:22.490 --> 01:43:25.140
<v Speaker 2>Where this is the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1880
01:43:25.610 --> 01:43:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Like this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this thing represents some future </v>

1881
01:43:31.821 --> 01:43:36.470
<v Speaker 2>that is totally that we don't cannot </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

1882
01:43:36.770 --> 01:43:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Just like a future in the 18th century </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a future with planes and smartphones </v>

1883
01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.140
<v Speaker 2>with somebody who could understand that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing,</v>

1884
01:43:45.410 --> 01:43:50.030
<v Speaker 2>that little dog could have had a a human</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness in it.</v>

1885
01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:53.270
<v Speaker 2>That was the feeling had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know exactly how it works.</v>

1886
01:43:53.271 --> 01:43:55.040
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing close to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>

1887
01:43:55.041 --> 01:44:00.041
<v Speaker 2>but it just gives you this picture of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the possibilities are of these </v>

1888
01:44:00.621 --> 01:44:05.621
<v Speaker 2>living creatures and I think that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>people feel when they see Boston </v>

1889
01:44:05.621 --> 01:44:08.741
<v Speaker 2>dynamics will call awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing running around is they don't </v>

1890
01:44:08.741 --> 01:44:09.470
<v Speaker 2>care about the technicalities and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>far away we are.</v>

1891
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:11.030
<v Speaker 2>They see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1892
01:44:11.031 --> 01:44:16.031
<v Speaker 2>this thing is pretty human and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities of human like things that </v>

1893
01:44:16.031 --> 01:44:20.531
<v Speaker 2>supercede humans and can evolve and </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn so quickly,</v>

1894
01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:26.290
<v Speaker 2>exponentially fast is this terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>frontier that that really makes us think</v>

1895
01:44:29.370 --> 01:44:30.260
<v Speaker 2>as it did for me.</v>

1896
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Maybe terrifying is a weird word because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I.</v>

1897
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:36.240
<v Speaker 1>When I look at it and I'm not a rational</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I look at there's.</v>

1898
01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:41.520
<v Speaker 1>There's videos that show the progression</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Boston dynamics robots from several </v>

1899
01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:46.780
<v Speaker 1>years ago to today what they're capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>of and it's.</v>

1900
01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:52.020
<v Speaker 1>It is a fascinating thing because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching all the hard work of these </v>

1901
01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:56.701
<v Speaker 1>engineers and all these people that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>designed these systems and have figured </v>

1902
01:44:57.761 --> 01:45:02.761
<v Speaker 1>out all of these problems at these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things encounter and they've come with </v>

1903
01:45:02.761 --> 01:45:06.301
<v Speaker 1>solutions and they continue to innovate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're constantly doing it and </v>

1904
01:45:06.301 --> 01:45:06.670
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing this and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1905
01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:09.310
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to see in a year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to see in three years?</v>

1906
01:45:09.311 --> 01:45:14.311
<v Speaker 1>What I want to see in five years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely fascinating because if </v>

1907
01:45:14.311 --> 01:45:16.510
<v Speaker 1>you extrapolate and you just keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

1908
01:45:16.511 --> 01:45:18.490
<v Speaker 1>you go 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

1909
01:45:18.491 --> 01:45:19.590
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>

1910
01:45:19.591 --> 01:45:21.850
<v Speaker 1>100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you have x Mokena</v>

1911
01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:23.400
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1912
01:45:23.401 --> 01:45:28.401
<v Speaker 2>you have x Makkah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at least in our imagination and our </v>

1913
01:45:28.401 --> 01:45:32.511
<v Speaker 2>imagination and the problem is there'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>be so many other things that are super </v>

1914
01:45:32.521 --> 01:45:34.050
<v Speaker 2>exciting and interesting,</v>

1915
01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:40.220
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean it's not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's many other things you </v>

1916
01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:42.420
<v Speaker 1>could focus on also that are also going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be bizarre and crazy.</v>

1917
01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about it just it?</v>

1918
01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:48.360
<v Speaker 1>It's going somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucker is getting better.</v>

1919
01:45:48.700 --> 01:45:53.700
<v Speaker 1>The the park core one is bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it hopping from box to box and </v>

1920
01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:55.470
<v Speaker 1>left to right and leaping up in the air </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

1921
01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:58.410
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think doesn't have any wires on it.</v>

1922
01:45:58.950 --> 01:46:03.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not connected to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just jumping from box to box.</v>

1923
01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:06.570
<v Speaker 1>If that thing had a machine gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was running across a hill at you,</v>

1924
01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:08.190
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

1925
01:46:08.191 --> 01:46:11.220
<v Speaker 1>How long does the battery last said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many bullets does it have?</v>

1926
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just say that I would pick Tim </v>

1927
01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:19.490
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy over that dog for the next 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1928
01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:20.920
<v Speaker 2>50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1929
01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:26.540
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a big Tim Kennedy I'm talking </v>

1930
01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:27.660
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1931
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:32.120
<v Speaker 2>but he'll probably have some robotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>additions to his body to improve the.</v>

1932
01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he tim Kennedy anymore?</v>

1933
01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:37.850
<v Speaker 2>If the brain is Tim Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he still Tim Kennedy.</v>

1934
01:46:37.851 --> 01:46:42.851
<v Speaker 2>That's the way we think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is huge concern about UN is </v>

1935
01:46:42.851 --> 01:46:45.140
<v Speaker 2>meeting about this autonomous weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1936
01:46:45.530 --> 01:46:46.370
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1937
01:46:47.210 --> 01:46:52.210
<v Speaker 2>it's allowing you to make decisions </v>
<v Speaker 2>about who lives and who dies is really </v>

1938
01:46:52.741 --> 01:46:57.741
<v Speaker 2>concerning in the short term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about a robotic dog with a </v>

1939
01:46:57.741 --> 01:47:01.851
<v Speaker 2>shotgun running around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more about our military wanting to </v>

1940
01:47:02.161 --> 01:47:04.710
<v Speaker 2>make destruction as efficient as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>

1941
01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:07.680
<v Speaker 2>minimizing human life and drones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drones.</v>

1942
01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:13.100
<v Speaker 2>There's something really uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me about drones in how you compare </v>

1943
01:47:13.170 --> 01:47:13.890
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1944
01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Dan Carlin hardcore history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the gang Iskcon.</v>

1945
01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:20.430
<v Speaker 2>There's something impersonal about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>drones are doing,</v>

1946
01:47:20.610 --> 01:47:25.610
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It moves you away from the actual </v>

1947
01:47:25.610 --> 01:47:28.910
<v Speaker 2>destruction that you're achieving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where I worry that our ability to encode</v>

1948
01:47:29.221 --> 01:47:33.780
<v Speaker 2>the ethics into these systems will go </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong in ways we don't expect.</v>

1949
01:47:34.590 --> 01:47:37.050
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean folks at the UN talk about,</v>

1950
01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:39.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have these automated,</v>

1951
01:47:39.150 --> 01:47:44.150
<v Speaker 2>so drones that make that drop bombs all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over a particular area.</v>

1952
01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:50.480
<v Speaker 2>So the bigger and bigger the area is </v>
<v Speaker 2>over which you allow an artificial </v>

1953
01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.650
<v Speaker 2>intelligence system to make a decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>to drop the bombs,</v>

1954
01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:58.100
<v Speaker 2>the weirder and weirder it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some line that presumably if </v>

1955
01:47:58.100 --> 01:48:00.390
<v Speaker 2>there's like three tanks that you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to destroy with a drone,</v>

1956
01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:04.400
<v Speaker 2>it's okay for ai assistant to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to destroy the street.</v>

1957
01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll handle everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just give me the three tanks.</v>

1958
01:48:07.770 --> 01:48:11.550
<v Speaker 2>But this makes me uncomfortable as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think,</v>

1959
01:48:12.050 --> 01:48:14.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm opposed to most wars.</v>

1960
01:48:14.850 --> 01:48:18.720
<v Speaker 2>But it's just military is military and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they tried to get the job done.</v>

1961
01:48:19.170 --> 01:48:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Now what if we now expand that to 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2100 tanks where you not let ai system </v>

1962
01:48:25.950 --> 01:48:29.340
<v Speaker 2>drop bombs all over very large areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can that go wrong?</v>

1963
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:35.390
<v Speaker 2>And that's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's practical engineering </v>

1964
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:38.271
<v Speaker 2>solutions to that oversight and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that engineers to sit </v>

1965
01:48:38.271 --> 01:48:40.760
<v Speaker 2>down and there's an engineering ethic </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you encoding,</v>

1966
01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:43.000
<v Speaker 2>you have meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1967
01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:45.270
<v Speaker 2>of how do we make this safe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you worry about.</v>

1968
01:48:45.530 --> 01:48:48.420
<v Speaker 2>A thing that keeps me up at night is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>40,000</v>

1969
01:48:48.421 --> 01:48:51.620
<v Speaker 2>people that die every year in auto </v>
<v Speaker 2>crashes like that.</v>

1970
01:48:51.690 --> 01:48:56.690
<v Speaker 2>I worry about not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to understand like I worry </v>

1971
01:48:56.690 --> 01:49:00.630
<v Speaker 2>about the future of Agi taking over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not as large.</v>

1972
01:49:00.631 --> 01:49:04.170
<v Speaker 2>Agi Now Agi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial general intelligence.</v>

1973
01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:07.200
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of the term is that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been using for this,</v>

1974
01:49:07.410 --> 01:49:12.410
<v Speaker 2>but I'm maybe because I'm in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worry more about the 40,000</v>

1975
01:49:13.021 --> 01:49:18.021
<v Speaker 2>people that die in the United States in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the one point 2 million that die every </v>

1976
01:49:18.021 --> 01:49:18.021
<v Speaker 2>year from auto crashes.</v>

1977
01:49:18.021 --> 01:49:22.970
<v Speaker 2>There's something that is more real to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me about the death that's happening now </v>

1978
01:49:24.361 --> 01:49:26.610
<v Speaker 2>that could be helped and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

1979
01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:30.450
<v Speaker 2>but a force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the threat becomes real,</v>

1980
01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:33.470
<v Speaker 2>then then that's a much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1981
01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:38.600
<v Speaker 2>that's a serious threat to humankind and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that should be thought </v>

1982
01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:43.131
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just worry that I worry also about the</v>

1983
01:49:43.530 --> 01:49:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Ai Winter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mentioned there's been two winters </v>

1984
01:49:48.530 --> 01:49:50.620
<v Speaker 2>in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the eighties,</v>

1985
01:49:50.621 --> 01:49:53.650
<v Speaker 2>the nineties when funding completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>dried up,</v>

1986
01:49:53.770 --> 01:49:58.630
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly just people stopped</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting into artificial intelligence and</v>

1987
01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:03.660
<v Speaker 2>became cynical about as possibilities </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there was a hype cycle where </v>

1988
01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:07.231
<v Speaker 2>everyone is really excited about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities of ai and then they </v>

1989
01:50:07.231 --> 01:50:07.231
<v Speaker 2>realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1990
01:50:07.231 --> 01:50:11.790
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years into the development that we </v>

1991
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:11.790
<v Speaker 2>didn't actually achieve anything.</v>

1992
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:12.650
<v Speaker 1>It was just too far off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too far off.</v>

1993
01:50:12.710 --> 01:50:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Same as it was for virtual reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the longest time.</v>

1994
01:50:16.131 --> 01:50:21.131
<v Speaker 1>Virtual reality was something that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed like even in the eighties and </v>

1995
01:50:21.131 --> 01:50:21.131
<v Speaker 1>the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

1996
01:50:21.131 --> 01:50:21.950
<v Speaker 1>it just died off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody even thought about it.</v>

1997
01:50:22.190 --> 01:50:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Now it's come back to the forefront when</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's real ai,</v>

1998
01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:31.540
<v Speaker 1>a real excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real virtual reality that you can use </v>

1999
01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:32.240
<v Speaker 1>like htc vives or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines.</v>

2000
01:50:32.241 --> 01:50:37.241
<v Speaker 1>We can put these helmets on and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really do see these alternative worlds </v>

2001
01:50:37.241 --> 01:50:42.221
<v Speaker 1>that people have created in these video </v>
<v Speaker 1>games and it's you realize like there's </v>

2002
01:50:42.221 --> 01:50:46.361
<v Speaker 1>a practical application for this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the technology has caught up </v>

2003
01:50:46.361 --> 01:50:46.361
<v Speaker 1>with the concept.</v>

2004
01:50:46.361 --> 01:50:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I actually don't know where people </v>

2005
01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:54.561
<v Speaker 2>stand on Vr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do quite a bit of stuff with Vr for </v>

2006
01:50:54.561 --> 01:50:54.561
<v Speaker 2>research purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for simulating robotic systems,</v>

2007
01:50:54.561 --> 01:50:59.361
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know where the hype is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if people calm down a </v>

2008
01:50:59.361 --> 01:51:02.721
<v Speaker 2>little bit on Vr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was a hype in the eighties and </v>

2009
01:51:02.721 --> 01:51:02.721
<v Speaker 2>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's ramped up quite a bit.</v>

2010
01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:05.820
<v Speaker 2>What does the other one that had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>oculus rift and what other,</v>

2011
01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:08.130
<v Speaker 2>what other than just those two?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the main ones.</v>

2012
01:51:08.131 --> 01:51:13.131
<v Speaker 2>And there's other headsets that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>work and use with and there's some you </v>

2013
01:51:13.131 --> 01:51:14.040
<v Speaker 2>can use just with a Samsung phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>

2014
01:51:14.070 --> 01:51:19.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the work of the next generation or </v>

2015
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:20.961
<v Speaker 2>which next year to two are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>all a stand alone systems is gonna be an</v>

2016
01:51:20.971 --> 01:51:23.640
<v Speaker 2>oculus rift coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need a computer for at all.</v>

2017
01:51:23.670 --> 01:51:24.780
<v Speaker 2>So the ultimate</v>

2018
01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:30.160
<v Speaker 1>and fear and game fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the event horizon of that is the Matrix,</v>

2019
01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:31.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2020
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:36.430
<v Speaker 1>that's what people were terrified of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have some sort of a virtual reality </v>

2021
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:37.070
<v Speaker 1>world where you don't exist in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical sense anymore.</v>

2022
01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:42.140
<v Speaker 1>They just plug something into the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>stem just like they do in the matrix and</v>

2023
01:51:42.530 --> 01:51:45.650
<v Speaker 1>you're just locked into this artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2024
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Is that terrifying to you as that seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be less terrifying than ai killing </v>

2025
01:51:50.830 --> 01:51:51.230
<v Speaker 2>all of humankind?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2026
01:51:51.231 --> 01:51:51.980
<v Speaker 2>it depends means</v>

2027
01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:54.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is life?</v>

2028
01:51:54.810 --> 01:51:56.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the real question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2029
01:51:56.011 --> 01:51:58.470
<v Speaker 1>If you only exist inside of a computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>

2030
01:51:58.471 --> 01:52:02.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's a wonderful program and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you whatever your consciousness is.</v>

2031
01:52:02.761 --> 01:52:04.410
<v Speaker 1>And we haven't really established what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

2032
01:52:04.411 --> 01:52:05.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

2033
01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:10.820
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of really weird </v>

2034
01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:10.820
<v Speaker 1>hippie ideas out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what consciousness is your body?</v>

2035
01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:15.591
<v Speaker 1>Just like an antenna man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like tuning into </v>

2036
01:52:15.591 --> 01:52:16.140
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and consciousness is all </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>

2037
01:52:16.141 --> 01:52:18.090
<v Speaker 1>It's Gaia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother earth.</v>

2038
01:52:18.091 --> 01:52:20.370
<v Speaker 1>It's the universe itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's God.</v>

2039
01:52:20.371 --> 01:52:21.720
<v Speaker 1>It's love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2040
01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2041
01:52:23.201 --> 01:52:26.700
<v Speaker 1>But if you could take that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is and send it in a</v>

2042
01:52:26.701 --> 01:52:30.000
<v Speaker 1>cell phone in New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that where your consciousness is now?</v>

2043
01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Because like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we figure out what consciousness is </v>

2044
01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:39.651
<v Speaker 1>and get it to the point where we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn it into a program or duplicate it,</v>

2045
01:52:40.830 --> 01:52:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's sounds so far away.</v>

2046
01:52:43.890 --> 01:52:47.840
<v Speaker 1>But if you weigh up to someone from 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 and said,</v>

2047
01:52:47.841 --> 01:52:52.841
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day I'm going to take a picture of </v>

2048
01:52:52.841 --> 01:52:52.841
<v Speaker 1>my Dick and I'm a sent to this girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's going to get it on her phone.</v>

2049
01:52:52.841 --> 01:52:57.371
<v Speaker 1>They be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about a </v>

2050
01:52:57.371 --> 01:52:57.371
<v Speaker 1>photo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do,</v>

2051
01:52:57.371 --> 01:52:57.500
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean you're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a photo?</v>

2052
01:52:57.680 --> 01:52:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a picture.</v>

2053
01:52:58.521 --> 01:53:01.340
<v Speaker 1>But like you don't draw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>

2054
01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:05.000
<v Speaker 1>It looks exactly like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in hd and I'm going to make a video</v>

2055
01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:08.400
<v Speaker 1>of me taking a shit and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>send it to every.</v>

2056
01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck is this even possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>can out of here.</v>

2057
01:53:11.370 --> 01:53:14.150
<v Speaker 1>The Dat is essentially you're capturing </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

2058
01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:17.210
<v Speaker 1>you're capturing moments in time at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

2059
01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:22.760
<v Speaker 1>not a very crude sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a crude sense in terms of comparing </v>

2060
01:53:23.811 --> 01:53:28.811
<v Speaker 1>it to the actual world in the moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's happening.</v>

2061
01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Like here you and I are having this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

2062
01:53:32.481 --> 01:53:34.340
<v Speaker 1>We're having it in front of this wooden </v>
<v Speaker 1>desk,</v>

2063
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:39.020
<v Speaker 1>his paper in front of you to you and I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have access to all the textures,</v>

2064
01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:41.480
<v Speaker 1>the sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can feel the air conditioning.</v>

2065
01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:42.900
<v Speaker 1>We can look up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could see the,</v>

2066
01:53:42.901 --> 01:53:43.730
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2067
01:53:44.050 --> 01:53:45.350
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ceiling.</v>

2068
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:46.850
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2069
01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:49.490
<v Speaker 1>we've got the whole thing in front of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're really here,</v>

2070
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:53.420
<v Speaker 1>but too many people that are watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>this on youtube right now.</v>

2071
01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:58.610
<v Speaker 1>They're getting a minimized crude </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of this</v>

2072
01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:02.000
<v Speaker 4>that's similar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it feels real.</v>

2073
01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:04.670
<v Speaker 4>It feels pretty real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty close.</v>

2074
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:06.740
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>

2075
01:54:06.741 --> 01:54:08.480
<v Speaker 4>I've listened to your podcast for </v>
<v Speaker 4>awhile.</v>

2076
01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:11.390
<v Speaker 4>You usually have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I listened to your podcast,</v>

2077
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:15.710
<v Speaker 4>it feels like I'm sitting in with </v>
<v Speaker 4>friends listening to a conversation,</v>

2078
01:54:15.980 --> 01:54:18.020
<v Speaker 4>so it's not as intense as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

2079
01:54:18.021 --> 01:54:23.021
<v Speaker 4>Dan Carlin's hardcore history where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy's like talking to me about the </v>

2080
01:54:23.630 --> 01:54:26.870
<v Speaker 4>darkest aspects of human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That show's so good.</v>

2081
01:54:26.871 --> 01:54:29.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you can call it a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a.</v>

2082
01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:30.770
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an experience.</v>

2083
01:54:31.190 --> 01:54:32.330
<v Speaker 4>You're there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was.</v>

2084
01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:37.660
<v Speaker 4>I was hanging out with him and getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>his con and I was in World War One.</v>

2085
01:54:38.151 --> 01:54:41.180
<v Speaker 4>World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>painful attainment is an episode he had.</v>

2086
01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:46.420
<v Speaker 4>We taught very dark ideas about our </v>
<v Speaker 4>human nature and desiring the </v>

2087
01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:51.890
<v Speaker 4>observation of the torture and suffering</v>
<v Speaker 4>of others.</v>

2088
01:54:51.891 --> 01:54:53.420
<v Speaker 4>There's something really appealing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

2089
01:54:53.421 --> 01:54:58.421
<v Speaker 4>He has this whole episode how throughout</v>
<v Speaker 4>history we liked watching people die and</v>

2090
01:54:58.521 --> 01:54:59.930
<v Speaker 4>there's something really dark.</v>

2091
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:03.500
<v Speaker 4>You're saying that if somebody streamed </v>
<v Speaker 4>or something like that,</v>

2092
01:55:03.501 --> 01:55:06.320
<v Speaker 4>now it would probably get hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>millions of views.</v>

2093
01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:07.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we would.</v>

2094
01:55:07.691 --> 01:55:12.691
<v Speaker 4>And we're protecting ourselves from our </v>
<v Speaker 4>own nature because we understand the </v>

2095
01:55:12.691 --> 01:55:16.301
<v Speaker 4>destructive aspects of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why youtube would pull something </v>

2096
01:55:16.301 --> 01:55:16.301
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2097
01:55:16.301 --> 01:55:19.900
<v Speaker 4>If you tied a person in between two </v>
<v Speaker 4>trucks and pulled them apart and put </v>

2098
01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:21.350
<v Speaker 4>that on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would get millions of hits,</v>

2099
01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:26.560
<v Speaker 4>but youtube would pull it because we've </v>
<v Speaker 4>decided as a society collectively that </v>

2100
01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:28.970
<v Speaker 4>those kinds of images or gruesome and </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible for us,</v>

2101
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:33.050
<v Speaker 4>but nevertheless that experience of </v>
<v Speaker 4>listening to his podcasts,</v>

2102
01:55:33.051 --> 01:55:38.051
<v Speaker 4>let's show it feels real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like Vr for me is really strongly </v>

2103
01:55:38.051 --> 01:55:42.761
<v Speaker 4>real aspects to it where I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure if the</v>

2104
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:49.010
<v Speaker 2>VR technology gets much better to where </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had a choice between do you want </v>

2105
01:55:49.010 --> 01:55:53.421
<v Speaker 2>to live your life in Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you you're going to die just like you </v>

2106
01:55:53.421 --> 01:55:55.590
<v Speaker 2>would in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning your body will die.</v>

2107
01:55:55.740 --> 01:56:00.740
<v Speaker 2>You're just going to hook up yourself to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a machine like it's a deprivation tank </v>

2108
01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:03.690
<v Speaker 2>and just all you are is in Vr and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to live in that world.</v>

2109
01:56:03.691 --> 01:56:08.691
<v Speaker 2>Which life would you choose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you choose life and Vr or would </v>

2110
01:56:08.691 --> 01:56:09.420
<v Speaker 2>you choose a real life?</v>

2111
01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:11.550
<v Speaker 1>That was the guy's decision in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Matrix,</v>

2112
01:56:11.551 --> 01:56:13.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy decided in the matrix,</v>

2113
01:56:13.491 --> 01:56:15.390
<v Speaker 1>you want it to be a special person in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the matrix.</v>

2114
01:56:15.391 --> 01:56:20.391
<v Speaker 1>He was eating that steak talking to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys and decided he was going to give </v>

2115
01:56:20.391 --> 01:56:20.391
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

2116
01:56:20.391 --> 01:56:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2117
01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:22.470
<v Speaker 1>So what decision would you make?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2118
01:56:22.770 --> 01:56:25.460
<v Speaker 1>what is reality if it's not what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing,</v>

2119
01:56:25.461 --> 01:56:30.461
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're experiencing something but </v>

2120
01:56:30.461 --> 01:56:32.331
<v Speaker 1>it's not tactile in the sense like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't drag it somewhere and put it on a </v>

2121
01:56:32.331 --> 01:56:33.810
<v Speaker 1>scale and take a ruler to it and measure</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2122
01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:38.220
<v Speaker 1>but in the moment of being there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it is.</v>

2123
01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:40.530
<v Speaker 1>What is missing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is missing?</v>

2124
01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not real.</v>

2125
01:56:41.590 --> 01:56:43.860
<v Speaker 1>What is real then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is real?</v>

2126
01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the ultimate question in terms of</v>

2127
01:56:45.691 --> 01:56:50.691
<v Speaker 1>like are we living in a simulation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that </v>

2128
01:56:50.691 --> 01:56:53.880
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] brought up when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to them and this is one thing </v>

2129
01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:58.341
<v Speaker 1>that people have struggled with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we are one day going to come up with </v>

2130
01:56:58.981 --> 01:57:03.510
<v Speaker 1>an artificial reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's indiscernible from reality in terms</v>

2131
01:57:03.511 --> 01:57:05.730
<v Speaker 1>of emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of experiences,</v>

2132
01:57:05.731 --> 01:57:06.780
<v Speaker 1>feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch,</v>

2133
01:57:06.781 --> 01:57:11.781
<v Speaker 1>smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the sensory input that you get </v>

2134
01:57:11.781 --> 01:57:12.690
<v Speaker 1>from the regular world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's inevitable,</v>

2135
01:57:12.691 --> 01:57:17.691
<v Speaker 1>if one day we do come up with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are we to discern whether or not we </v>

2136
01:57:17.691 --> 01:57:19.980
<v Speaker 1>have already created that and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck in it right now</v>

2137
01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:24.180
<v Speaker 2>that we can't and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical arguments for that,</v>

2138
01:57:24.181 --> 01:57:25.530
<v Speaker 2>but that gets it the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2139
01:57:25.531 --> 01:57:27.590
<v Speaker 2>The nature of reality is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2140
01:57:27.730 --> 01:57:32.730
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating because we're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're totally clueless about what it </v>

2141
01:57:32.730 --> 01:57:36.090
<v Speaker 2>means to be real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It needs to exist to exist.</v>

2142
01:57:36.091 --> 01:57:38.490
<v Speaker 2>So consciousness for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2143
01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:43.520
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at your own hand like I'm </v>

2144
01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:45.210
<v Speaker 2>pretty sure I'm on the Joe Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience podcast.</v>

2145
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:48.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure this is not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm imagining all of it.</v>

2146
01:57:48.391 --> 01:57:53.391
<v Speaker 2>There's a knife in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's surreal and I have no proof </v>

2147
01:57:53.391 --> 01:57:57.561
<v Speaker 2>that it's not fake and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those kinds of things actually come </v>

2148
01:57:57.561 --> 01:58:01.371
<v Speaker 2>into play with the way we think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence to like what is </v>

2149
01:58:01.371 --> 01:58:04.110
<v Speaker 2>intelligence?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it seems like we're easily</v>

2150
01:58:04.111 --> 01:58:09.111
<v Speaker 2>impressed by by algorithms and robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We create that appear to have </v>

2151
01:58:09.391 --> 01:58:14.391
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we still don't know what is </v>

2152
01:58:14.391 --> 01:58:15.810
<v Speaker 2>intelligent and how close those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are to us</v>

2153
01:58:15.970 --> 01:58:20.970
<v Speaker 1>and we think that ourselves as this </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological entity that can think and </v>

2154
01:58:20.970 --> 01:58:25.951
<v Speaker 1>talk and cry and laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're somehow or another more </v>

2155
01:58:25.951 --> 01:58:30.211
<v Speaker 1>important than sort of some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>silicone based thing that we create that</v>

2156
01:58:30.731 --> 01:58:32.620
<v Speaker 1>does everything that we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But far better.</v>

2157
01:58:33.090 --> 01:58:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2158
01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:39.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if I were to take a stand still </v>

2159
01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:39.080
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand,</v>

2160
01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:41.770
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm young one day run for </v>
<v Speaker 2>president in this platform by the way</v>

2161
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:45.400
<v Speaker 4>that defending the rights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't because I'm rushing,</v>

2162
01:58:45.401 --> 01:58:47.660
<v Speaker 4>but maybe a little cheesy rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2163
01:58:48.130 --> 01:58:52.310
<v Speaker 4>that the robots will have rights and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

2164
01:58:52.450 --> 01:58:52.890
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

2165
01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:56.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>robots lives matter and I,</v>

2166
01:58:56.310 --> 01:59:01.310
<v Speaker 4>I actually believe that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to start struggling with the idea </v>

2167
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:06.510
<v Speaker 4>of how we interact with robots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen too often the abuse of robots </v>

2168
01:59:06.510 --> 01:59:08.290
<v Speaker 4>and not just the Boston dynamics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but literally people.</v>

2169
01:59:09.310 --> 01:59:12.500
<v Speaker 4>You leave them alone with the robot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That dark nature of Hue,</v>

2170
01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:17.940
<v Speaker 4>dark aspects of human nature comes out </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's worrying to me I would like a </v>

2171
01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:22.831
<v Speaker 4>robot that spars but only can move it </v>
<v Speaker 4>like 50 percent of what I can move out </v>

2172
01:59:22.831 --> 01:59:24.330
<v Speaker 4>so I could fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2173
01:59:24.810 --> 01:59:27.910
<v Speaker 4>She shouldn't be able to practice like </v>
<v Speaker 4>really well.</v>

2174
01:59:28.150 --> 01:59:31.690
<v Speaker 4>Like you would develop like some awesome</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sparring instincts.</v>

2175
01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:32.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I a robot,</v>

2176
01:59:32.741 --> 01:59:34.360
<v Speaker 4>but there would still be consequences.</v>

2177
01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:37.210
<v Speaker 4>Like if you did fuck up and you got lazy</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it led,</v>

2178
01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:38.440
<v Speaker 4>kicked you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you didn't check it.</v>

2179
01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:43.500
<v Speaker 4>It would hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would love to see a last stream of </v>

2180
01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:46.230
<v Speaker 4>that session because the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2181
01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:48.940
<v Speaker 4>there's so many ways I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I had practiced on a dummy.</v>

2182
01:59:48.970 --> 01:59:53.970
<v Speaker 4>There is aspects to a dummy that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>helpful in terms of positioning and </v>

2183
01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:58.360
<v Speaker 4>where were your stances and technique to</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2184
01:59:58.570 --> 02:00:03.570
<v Speaker 4>I could certainly see that going wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>in ways where a robot might not respect </v>

2185
02:00:03.881 --> 02:00:06.730
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tapping or world supposed to beat you to</v>

2186
02:00:06.731 --> 02:00:11.731
<v Speaker 4>death as tired as you fucking it up </v>
<v Speaker 4>every day and one day you get tired or </v>

2187
02:00:11.731 --> 02:00:16.261
<v Speaker 4>what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sprain your ankle and it gets on top of </v>

2188
02:00:16.261 --> 02:00:18.151
<v Speaker 4>you and mounts you and just starts </v>
<v Speaker 4>blasting the face and to say he'll hook </v>

2189
02:00:18.151 --> 02:00:19.180
<v Speaker 4>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to be able to say,</v>

2190
02:00:19.181 --> 02:00:19.720
<v Speaker 4>stop.</v>

2191
02:00:20.530 --> 02:00:25.530
<v Speaker 4>Well then no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna have to use your martial </v>

2192
02:00:25.530 --> 02:00:25.530
<v Speaker 4>art to defend yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2193
02:00:25.530 --> 02:00:28.300
<v Speaker 4>Because if you make it too easy for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>robot to just stop at any time,</v>

2194
02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:32.110
<v Speaker 4>then you're not really going to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the consequences of training</v>

2195
02:00:32.170 --> 02:00:36.010
<v Speaker 4>if you're out of shape is if you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>tired people fuck you up.</v>

2196
02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:38.350
<v Speaker 4>And that's incentive for you to not get </v>
<v Speaker 4>tired.</v>

2197
02:00:38.351 --> 02:00:41.830
<v Speaker 4>Like there was so many times that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be in the gym,</v>

2198
02:00:41.831 --> 02:00:46.831
<v Speaker 4>like doing strength and conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think about moments where I got </v>

2199
02:00:46.831 --> 02:00:47.290
<v Speaker 4>tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What guys caught me and something that I</v>

2200
02:00:47.291 --> 02:00:49.300
<v Speaker 4>was exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't get out of the triangle.</v>

2201
02:00:49.301 --> 02:00:49.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

2202
02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:55.140
<v Speaker 4>And I just fucking die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just really push on the treadmill or </v>

2203
02:00:55.140 --> 02:00:55.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>push on the um,</v>

2204
02:00:55.210 --> 02:00:55.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2205
02:00:56.560 --> 02:00:58.870
<v Speaker 4>airdyne bike or whatever it was that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was doing,</v>

2206
02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:00.490
<v Speaker 4>thinking about those moments.</v>

2207
02:01:00.490 --> 02:01:01.750
<v Speaker 4>Getting tired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2208
02:01:01.751 --> 02:01:03.670
<v Speaker 4>those moments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think about when I do like</v>

2209
02:01:03.671 --> 02:01:08.190
<v Speaker 4>sprints and stuff was um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the feeling of competition,</v>

2210
02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:12.310
<v Speaker 4>those nerves of stepping in there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

2211
02:01:12.510 --> 02:01:14.710
<v Speaker 4>it's really hard to do that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>visualization.</v>

2212
02:01:14.711 --> 02:01:17.700
<v Speaker 4>But it was effective though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

2213
02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:22.740
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the feeling of consequences to you not </v>

2214
02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:26.041
<v Speaker 4>having any energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to muster up the energy </v>

2215
02:01:26.041 --> 02:01:29.970
<v Speaker 4>because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get fucked up or </v>

2216
02:01:29.970 --> 02:01:29.970
<v Speaker 4>something bad's going to happen to </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone you care about or something.</v>

2217
02:01:30.010 --> 02:01:33.010
<v Speaker 4>Something's gonna Happen to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you're a superhero.</v>

2218
02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:37.540
<v Speaker 4>You saving the world from the robots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

2219
02:01:38.370 --> 02:01:39.460
<v Speaker 4>But I did go back</v>

2220
02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry to interrupt you,</v>

2221
02:01:40.801 --> 02:01:43.100
<v Speaker 1>but just to bring this all back around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2222
02:01:43.101 --> 02:01:48.101
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this life and what is </v>

2223
02:01:48.101 --> 02:01:48.270
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and what does this </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

2224
02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>and if you can replicate this experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's indiscernible,</v>

2225
02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>will you choose to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone says to you,</v>

2226
02:01:54.991 --> 02:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Hey Lex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have much time left,</v>

2227
02:01:59.670 --> 02:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have an option,</v>

2228
02:02:01.890 --> 02:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>we have an option and we can take your </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

2229
02:02:05.191 --> 02:02:08.370
<v Speaker 1>As you know it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it into this program.</v>

2230
02:02:08.550 --> 02:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>You will have no idea that this has </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

2231
02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>You're going to close your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to wake up,</v>

2232
02:02:12.391 --> 02:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be in the most beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>green field.</v>

2233
02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:17.250
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be naked women everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feasts,</v>

2234
02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:22.280
<v Speaker 1>everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be just picnic tables </v>

2235
02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:25.461
<v Speaker 1>filled with the most glorious food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to drive around a Ferrari </v>

2236
02:02:25.461 --> 02:02:27.570
<v Speaker 1>every day and fly around in a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never going to die.</v>

2237
02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:30.110
<v Speaker 1>You can have a great time or take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>

2238
02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Chances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See what happens?</v>

2239
02:02:31.410 --> 02:02:34.740
<v Speaker 4>Shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2240
02:02:34.770 --> 02:02:36.030
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a simple man.</v>

2241
02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:38.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't need multiple women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is good.</v>

2242
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:40.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm romantic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you say,</v>

2243
02:02:40.650 --> 02:02:43.050
<v Speaker 4>but that's in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this world.</v>

2244
02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:48.200
<v Speaker 4>You've got an incentive to not be greedy</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this other world where you can </v>

2245
02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:48.870
<v Speaker 4>breathe underwater and fly through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>air and you know,</v>

2246
02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:54.160
<v Speaker 4>not I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that scarcity is the </v>

2247
02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:58.880
<v Speaker 4>fundamental ingredient of happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you give me 72 virgins,</v>

2248
02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:03.500
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we just keep one slut,</v>

2249
02:03:05.730 --> 02:03:08.100
<v Speaker 4>slut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she a requirement.</v>

2250
02:03:08.101 --> 02:03:11.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody intelligent and interesting who</v>

2251
02:03:11.311 --> 02:03:16.311
<v Speaker 4>enjoys sexual intercourse was not just </v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoy sexual intercourse with a person.</v>

2252
02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:20.790
<v Speaker 4>Well that and keeps things interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>lex.</v>

2253
02:03:20.791 --> 02:03:25.791
<v Speaker 4>We can engineer all this into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience as you don't need all these </v>

2254
02:03:25.791 --> 02:03:25.791
<v Speaker 4>different women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

2255
02:03:25.791 --> 02:03:28.200
<v Speaker 4>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got this program for you.</v>

2256
02:03:28.201 --> 02:03:29.550
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2257
02:03:29.551 --> 02:03:31.560
<v Speaker 4>You want one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one and a normal car,</v>

2258
02:03:31.561 --> 02:03:33.180
<v Speaker 4>like maybe a Saab or something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2259
02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:34.270
<v Speaker 4>Nothing crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2260
02:03:34.410 --> 02:03:35.050
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2261
02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:37.200
<v Speaker 4>But you're a simple man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

2262
02:03:37.250 --> 02:03:42.250
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you need to at chess with someone </v>

2263
02:03:42.250 --> 02:03:42.250
<v Speaker 4>who could beat you every now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2264
02:03:42.250 --> 02:03:42.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not just chess.</v>

2265
02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:44.070
<v Speaker 4>So engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some flaws.</v>

2266
02:03:44.071 --> 02:03:46.410
<v Speaker 4>Like she needs to be able to lose her </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

2267
02:03:46.411 --> 02:03:49.460
<v Speaker 4>Every once in a while the matrix or on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the red dress.</v>

2268
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:51.390
<v Speaker 4>Which girl in the red dress that comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>right here.</v>

2269
02:03:51.410 --> 02:03:52.140
<v Speaker 4>Remember?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes like,</v>

2270
02:03:52.141 --> 02:03:53.640
<v Speaker 4>did you notice the girl in the red </v>
<v Speaker 4>dress?</v>

2271
02:03:53.670 --> 02:03:55.140
<v Speaker 4>It's like the one that catches his </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention.</v>

2272
02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:58.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is right at the very beginning when</v>

2273
02:03:58.021 --> 02:04:01.080
<v Speaker 4>he's telling them what the Matrix is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She walks by right here.</v>

2274
02:04:01.230 --> 02:04:02.070
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there she is,</v>

2275
02:04:02.130 --> 02:04:04.620
<v Speaker 4>but Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's your girl.</v>

2276
02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:06.270
<v Speaker 4>The guy afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I ended up telling you.</v>

2277
02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:10.200
<v Speaker 4>It's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

2278
02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:10.680
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2279
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:15.910
<v Speaker 4>but then I have certain features like </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not an iphone guy like android so </v>

2280
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:16.830
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that may be an iphone persons girl,</v>

2281
02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:17.970
<v Speaker 4>but that's nonsense.</v>

2282
02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:21.120
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I blew up an iphone.</v>

2283
02:04:21.121 --> 02:04:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Came along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was better than android.</v>

2284
02:04:22.591 --> 02:04:24.210
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't want to use it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2285
02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:26.040
<v Speaker 4>it might just definition of better is </v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

2286
02:04:26.100 --> 02:04:27.610
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2287
02:04:28.050 --> 02:04:33.050
<v Speaker 4>I know for me a happiness lies in </v>
<v Speaker 4>android phones,</v>

2288
02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:36.960
<v Speaker 4>android phones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>close connection.</v>

2289
02:04:37.050 --> 02:04:42.050
<v Speaker 4>Other human beings who are flawed but </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting who are passionate about </v>

2290
02:04:42.050 --> 02:04:42.050
<v Speaker 4>what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2291
02:04:42.050 --> 02:04:42.930
<v Speaker 4>But this is all engineered into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>program.</v>

2292
02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:43.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2293
02:04:43.770 --> 02:04:48.770
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm requesting features here because </v>

2294
02:04:48.770 --> 02:04:48.770
<v Speaker 4>you're requesting features,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why?</v>

2295
02:04:48.770 --> 02:04:49.740
<v Speaker 4>Why android phones?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that like,</v>

2296
02:04:49.741 --> 02:04:51.090
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Republican.</v>

2297
02:04:51.150 --> 02:04:53.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like android phones.</v>

2298
02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:55.680
<v Speaker 4>Is that what you're doing to get in </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribal?</v>

2299
02:04:55.730 --> 02:04:58.630
<v Speaker 4>Not Electronics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally not drivable.</v>

2300
02:04:58.631 --> 02:05:02.370
<v Speaker 4>I was just representing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I figured the girl in the red dress,</v>

2301
02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:06.000
<v Speaker 4>it just seems like an iphone as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>feature set.</v>

2302
02:05:06.090 --> 02:05:08.870
<v Speaker 4>I imagined the kind of features I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>asking you a lot.</v>

2303
02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:14.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it seems like she's not interested </v>

2304
02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:14.540
<v Speaker 4>in dusty yefsky.</v>

2305
02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:19.010
<v Speaker 4>How would you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So prejudice view just because she's </v>

2306
02:05:19.010 --> 02:05:20.700
<v Speaker 4>beautiful and she's got a fitting dress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2307
02:05:20.730 --> 02:05:22.470
<v Speaker 4>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fair.</v>

2308
02:05:22.471 --> 02:05:24.600
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sexist son of a bitch.</v>

2309
02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:27.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually that was a totally.</v>

2310
02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:32.240
<v Speaker 4>She probably likes Nietzschean and sts </v>
<v Speaker 4>can come when I say she did her phd in </v>

2311
02:05:32.490 --> 02:05:34.140
<v Speaker 4>astrophysics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Possibly.</v>

2312
02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:38.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we're talking about.</v>

2313
02:05:38.041 --> 02:05:39.660
<v Speaker 4>All the trappings that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

2314
02:05:39.661 --> 02:05:44.661
<v Speaker 4>I'll take her all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I phone Andrew Commerce or if she's a </v>

2315
02:05:44.731 --> 02:05:48.540
<v Speaker 4>windows phone about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to give off windows phone.</v>

2316
02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:50.040
<v Speaker 4>Come on now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll take her.</v>

2317
02:05:50.070 --> 02:05:52.860
<v Speaker 4>She's a windows phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll go with a flip phone from the early</v>

2318
02:05:52.861 --> 02:05:54.810
<v Speaker 4>two thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll take a razor phone,</v>

2319
02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:58.860
<v Speaker 4>a Motorola razor phone with like 37 </v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes of battery life.</v>

2320
02:06:02.220 --> 02:06:03.330
<v Speaker 4>But we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

2321
02:06:03.390 --> 02:06:08.390
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about all the learning </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences and preferences that you've </v>

2322
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:11.550
<v Speaker 4>developed in your time here on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>actual real earth or what we're assuming</v>

2323
02:06:11.551 --> 02:06:14.130
<v Speaker 4>is the actual real earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But how are we,</v>

2324
02:06:14.610 --> 02:06:15.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

2325
02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:20.120
<v Speaker 4>if you really are taking into account </v>
<v Speaker 4>the possibility that one day something </v>

2326
02:06:21.150 --> 02:06:26.150
<v Speaker 4>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's artificial intelligence </v>

2327
02:06:26.150 --> 02:06:28.350
<v Speaker 4>figures it out or we figured out </v>
<v Speaker 4>engineering a world,</v>

2328
02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:33.920
<v Speaker 4>us some sort of a simulation that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>just as real as this world.</v>

2329
02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:39.510
<v Speaker 4>Like where there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no.</v>

2330
02:06:39.730 --> 02:06:44.730
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible to discern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only is it not always impossible to </v>

2331
02:06:44.730 --> 02:06:49.671
<v Speaker 4>discern,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people choose not to discern anymore </v>

2332
02:06:49.671 --> 02:06:49.671
<v Speaker 4>because it's so well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why bother?</v>

2333
02:06:49.671 --> 02:06:51.840
<v Speaker 4>Why bother discerning?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a fascinating concept to me,</v>

2334
02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:55.680
<v Speaker 4>but I think that world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not to sound hippie or anything,</v>

2335
02:06:55.681 --> 02:06:58.680
<v Speaker 4>but I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we live in a world that's pretty</v>

2336
02:06:58.681 --> 02:06:59.250
<v Speaker 4>damn good.</v>

2337
02:06:59.730 --> 02:07:00.960
<v Speaker 4>That is pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

2338
02:07:00.961 --> 02:07:05.340
<v Speaker 4>But improving it with such fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine ladies walking around.</v>

2339
02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:08.460
<v Speaker 4>It's not necessarily that the delta </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's positive.</v>

2340
02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:13.580
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's one aspect of the </v>

2341
02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:13.580
<v Speaker 4>improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about improving it?</v>

2342
02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:16.650
<v Speaker 4>And in this new world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no drone attacks in Yemen that </v>

2343
02:07:16.650 --> 02:07:17.330
<v Speaker 4>killed children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I order,</v>

2344
02:07:17.370 --> 02:07:21.210
<v Speaker 4>there's no rape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no sexual harassment,</v>

2345
02:07:21.270 --> 02:07:24.090
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no racism,</v>

2346
02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:29.160
<v Speaker 4>there's no any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the negative aspects of our current </v>

2347
02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:29.490
<v Speaker 4>culture or engineered out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

2348
02:07:29.970 --> 02:07:34.970
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of religions have </v>
<v Speaker 4>struggled with this and of course I </v>

2349
02:07:34.970 --> 02:07:35.070
<v Speaker 4>would say I would want a world without </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2350
02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 4>but part</v>

2351
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:41.010
<v Speaker 2>of me thinks that our world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful because of the suffering in </v>

2352
02:07:41.010 --> 02:07:41.010
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

2353
02:07:41.010 --> 02:07:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real problem,</v>

2354
02:07:42.241 --> 02:07:43.620
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real.</v>

2355
02:07:43.621 --> 02:07:45.960
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a fascinating concept.</v>

2356
02:07:45.961 --> 02:07:50.961
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible to ignore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you appreciate love because of all </v>

2357
02:07:50.961 --> 02:07:52.510
<v Speaker 1>the hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2358
02:07:53.460 --> 02:07:58.460
<v Speaker 1>like if you have a hard time finding a </v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend and just no one's compatible </v>

2359
02:07:58.460 --> 02:08:02.580
<v Speaker 1>and obviously the Hala letting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies know,</v>

2360
02:08:03.090 --> 02:08:08.090
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do have a hard time connecting </v>

2361
02:08:08.090 --> 02:08:09.480
<v Speaker 1>with someone and then you finally do </v>
<v Speaker 1>connect with someone off after all those</v>

2362
02:08:09.481 --> 02:08:12.810
<v Speaker 1>years of loneliness and this person's </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly compatible with you,</v>

2363
02:08:12.811 --> 02:08:14.460
<v Speaker 1>how much more will you appreciate them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then?</v>

2364
02:08:14.461 --> 02:08:19.461
<v Speaker 1>A guy like Dan Bilzerian was flying </v>
<v Speaker 1>around in a private jet bang and tens </v>

2365
02:08:19.461 --> 02:08:23.661
<v Speaker 1>all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe he's fucking drowning in his </v>

2366
02:08:23.661 --> 02:08:26.070
<v Speaker 1>own sorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's got too much,</v>

2367
02:08:26.610 --> 02:08:29.060
<v Speaker 1>too much prosperity and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2368
02:08:29.370 --> 02:08:34.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had that with social networks to the </v>

2369
02:08:34.370 --> 02:08:34.370
<v Speaker 2>people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2370
02:08:34.370 --> 02:08:38.070
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty famous in the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>love you get is huge.</v>

2371
02:08:38.430 --> 02:08:43.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be because of the overflow of </v>

2372
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:45.540
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be difficult to appreciate more</v>

2373
02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:47.280
<v Speaker 2>like genuine little moments of love.</v>

2374
02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:49.930
<v Speaker 1>And it's not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2375
02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2376
02:08:51.130 --> 02:08:56.130
<v Speaker 1>I spent a lot of time thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and I also spent a lot of time </v>

2377
02:08:56.130 --> 02:09:00.211
<v Speaker 1>thinking about how titanic really </v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre my place in the world is.</v>

2378
02:09:01.630 --> 02:09:02.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2379
02:09:02.031 --> 02:09:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I think about it a lot and I spent a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time being poor and being a loser.</v>

2380
02:09:06.750 --> 02:09:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my childhood was not the best.</v>

2381
02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:14.240
<v Speaker 1>I went through a lot of struggle when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was young that I cling to like a safety </v>

2382
02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:15.550
<v Speaker 1>rep raft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2383
02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2384
02:09:16.660 --> 02:09:21.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever think there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>special about me and I try to let </v>

2385
02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:22.780
<v Speaker 1>everybody know that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody can do it.</v>

2386
02:09:22.781 --> 02:09:26.010
<v Speaker 1>I've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to just keep going though.</v>

2387
02:09:26.090 --> 02:09:31.090
<v Speaker 1>The 99 percent of this thing is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing up and keep going.</v>

2388
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Keep improving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep working at things and keep going,</v>

2389
02:09:34.630 --> 02:09:35.400
<v Speaker 1>put the time in,</v>

2390
02:09:35.470 --> 02:09:37.870
<v Speaker 2>but the interesting thing is you haven't</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

2391
02:09:37.871 --> 02:09:40.780
<v Speaker 2>a couple of days ago went back to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>first podcast and listen to it.</v>

2392
02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:44.410
<v Speaker 2>You haven't really changed much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you were.</v>

2393
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:49.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean the audio got a little better and</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just like the year,</v>

2394
02:09:49.661 --> 02:09:54.661
<v Speaker 2>the genuine nature of the way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>interact hasn't changed and that's </v>

2395
02:09:54.661 --> 02:09:56.140
<v Speaker 2>fascinating because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2396
02:09:56.170 --> 02:09:58.780
<v Speaker 2>fame changes people.</v>

2397
02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was already famous then,</v>

2398
02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:03.580
<v Speaker 1>but just in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was famous.</v>

2399
02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:08.410
<v Speaker 1>I was already famous from fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was already already had standup comedy</v>

2400
02:10:08.411 --> 02:10:12.910
<v Speaker 1>specials already had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd already been on a sitcom.</v>

2401
02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't as famous as I am now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I understood what it is.</v>

2402
02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:22.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer in adversity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle.</v>

2403
02:10:22.451 --> 02:10:27.451
<v Speaker 1>I think they're very important for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why appreciate </v>

2404
02:10:27.451 --> 02:10:30.211
<v Speaker 1>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why I've been </v>

2405
02:10:30.211 --> 02:10:32.731
<v Speaker 1>drawn to it as a learning tool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just as something where it's a </v>

2406
02:10:32.731 --> 02:10:37.621
<v Speaker 1>puzzle that I'm fascinated to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to get better at the </v>

2407
02:10:37.621 --> 02:10:40.781
<v Speaker 1>puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And martial arts is a really good </v>

2408
02:10:40.781 --> 02:10:40.781
<v Speaker 1>example because you never really the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best,</v>

2409
02:10:40.781 --> 02:10:42.830
<v Speaker 1>especially when there's just so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people doing it.</v>

2410
02:10:42.890 --> 02:10:44.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're always going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat by guys.</v>

2411
02:10:44.691 --> 02:10:49.691
<v Speaker 1>And then I was never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was never putting the time into it as </v>

2412
02:10:49.691 --> 02:10:49.691
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an adult outside of,</v>

2413
02:10:49.691 --> 02:10:51.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my taekwondo competition.</v>

2414
02:10:51.170 --> 02:10:54.950
<v Speaker 1>I was never really putting all day every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day into it.</v>

2415
02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of people that I would train </v>
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>

2416
02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:59.360
<v Speaker 1>And so I'd always get dominated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>really best guys.</v>

2417
02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:02.750
<v Speaker 1>So there's a certain amount of humility </v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes from that as well.</v>

2418
02:11:03.050 --> 02:11:08.050
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a struggle in that you're </v>

2419
02:11:08.050 --> 02:11:11.711
<v Speaker 1>learning about yourself and your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>limits and the limits of the human mind </v>

2420
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:19.990
<v Speaker 1>and endurance and just not understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the various interactions of </v>

2421
02:11:20.181 --> 02:11:21.740
<v Speaker 1>techniques and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2422
02:11:22.010 --> 02:11:27.010
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's humility to that in that I've </v>

2423
02:11:27.010 --> 02:11:29.411
<v Speaker 1>always described martial arts as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicle for developing your own human </v>

2424
02:11:29.411 --> 02:11:33.071
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think marathon running a similar </v>

2425
02:11:33.071 --> 02:11:33.080
<v Speaker 1>aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you're just,</v>

2426
02:11:33.110 --> 02:11:38.110
<v Speaker 1>you figure out a way to keep pushing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>push through the control of your mind </v>

2427
02:11:38.961 --> 02:11:41.360
<v Speaker 1>and your desire and overcoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>adversity.</v>

2428
02:11:41.361 --> 02:11:43.910
<v Speaker 1>I think overcoming adversity is critical</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the human,</v>

2429
02:11:45.110 --> 02:11:46.040
<v Speaker 1>for humans.</v>

2430
02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:49.250
<v Speaker 1>We have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2431
02:11:49.251 --> 02:11:54.251
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these set of reward systems that are </v>

2432
02:11:54.251 --> 02:11:57.170
<v Speaker 1>designed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reward us for overcoming,</v>

2433
02:11:57.530 --> 02:12:01.760
<v Speaker 1>for overcoming obstacles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for overcoming a relationship,</v>

2434
02:12:01.761 --> 02:12:05.240
<v Speaker 1>struggles for overcoming physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations.</v>

2435
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:10.510
<v Speaker 1>And those rewards are great and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are some of the most amazing moments in </v>

2436
02:12:10.510 --> 02:12:15.341
<v Speaker 1>life when you do overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is sort of engineered </v>

2437
02:12:15.341 --> 02:12:16.100
<v Speaker 1>into the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

2438
02:12:16.101 --> 02:12:20.300
<v Speaker 1>fame is almost like a cheat code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't really want it.</v>

2439
02:12:20.301 --> 02:12:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Don't dwell on that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that is,</v>

2440
02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:24.650
<v Speaker 1>that's like a free buffet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't,</v>

2441
02:12:24.910 --> 02:12:26.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to go hunt your own food,</v>

2442
02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:31.990
<v Speaker 1>you want to make your own fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to cook yourself and feel the </v>

2443
02:12:31.990 --> 02:12:32.600
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want people feeding you grapes</v>

2444
02:12:32.601 --> 02:12:33.590
<v Speaker 1>while you lie down.</v>

2445
02:12:34.210 --> 02:12:38.170
<v Speaker 2>What is the hardest thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you talked about challenge a lot.</v>

2446
02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:42.520
<v Speaker 2>What's the hardest thing you've won?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you been really humbled</v>

2447
02:12:43.150 --> 02:12:44.440
<v Speaker 1>martial arts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

2448
02:12:44.441 --> 02:12:46.360
<v Speaker 1>The most humbling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2449
02:12:46.361 --> 02:12:50.860
<v Speaker 1>from the moment I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I got really good at taekwondo,</v>

2450
02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:55.920
<v Speaker 1>but even then I'd still get the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>beaten out of me by my friends and got </v>

2451
02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:59.640
<v Speaker 1>training part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're tired and you're </v>

2452
02:12:59.640 --> 02:12:59.960
<v Speaker 1>doing your rotating partners and guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>are bigger than you.</v>

2453
02:12:59.961 --> 02:13:02.080
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just humbling,</v>

2454
02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:03.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts,</v>

2455
02:13:03.191 --> 02:13:03.880
<v Speaker 1>very humbling.</v>

2456
02:13:04.730 --> 02:13:07.080
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to call you out on something.</v>

2457
02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:12.090
<v Speaker 2>So you talk about education system </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I've heard you say is a little</v>

2458
02:13:12.091 --> 02:13:17.091
<v Speaker 2>broken in high school and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really calling out and just I </v>

2459
02:13:18.301 --> 02:13:21.420
<v Speaker 2>just want to talk about it because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's important and as somebody who</v>

2460
02:13:21.421 --> 02:13:24.870
<v Speaker 2>loves math,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it talked about your own journey.</v>

2461
02:13:24.871 --> 02:13:29.871
<v Speaker 2>Was school didn't give you a passion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you can maybe talk to that,</v>

2462
02:13:35.011 --> 02:13:39.930
<v Speaker 2>but for me what I always do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm sick in the head or something,</v>

2463
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:43.760
<v Speaker 2>but for me math was exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way martial arts,</v>

2464
02:13:43.810 --> 02:13:46.710
<v Speaker 2>we're excited for you because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard.</v>

2465
02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to quit and the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of education,</v>

2466
02:13:50.611 --> 02:13:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2467
02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:57.620
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be flawed nowadays a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit is that we want to make </v>

2468
02:13:57.620 --> 02:14:01.050
<v Speaker 2>education easier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we want to make more accessible and</v>

2469
02:14:01.051 --> 02:14:01.470
<v Speaker 2>so on.</v>

2470
02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accessible of course is great,</v>

2471
02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:06.870
<v Speaker 2>but you kind of forget in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are all good goals.</v>

2472
02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:11.790
<v Speaker 2>You forget in that it's supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>also hard and like teachers,</v>

2473
02:14:12.450 --> 02:14:15.510
<v Speaker 2>just the way you're wrestling coach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like quit,</v>

2474
02:14:15.511 --> 02:14:16.730
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do anymore.</v>

2475
02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:18.660
<v Speaker 2>I have to come up with some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse.</v>

2476
02:14:18.930 --> 02:14:23.930
<v Speaker 2>You're wrestling coach looks at you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to say get your ass back on the </v>

2477
02:14:23.930 --> 02:14:25.890
<v Speaker 2>mat the same way I wish math teachers </v>
<v Speaker 2>did that.</v>

2478
02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:30.840
<v Speaker 2>When people say it's almost like cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>now to say i's not math sucks,</v>

2479
02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:35.280
<v Speaker 2>mass not for me or science sucks as his </v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher's boring.</v>

2480
02:14:35.910 --> 02:14:40.910
<v Speaker 2>I think there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's room for some culture where </v>

2481
02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:40.910
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2482
02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:40.910
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2483
02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:44.510
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just put in the time and you </v>

2484
02:14:44.510 --> 02:14:45.210
<v Speaker 2>struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that opens up the universe to you.</v>

2485
02:14:45.270 --> 02:14:49.530
<v Speaker 2>Like whether you become a neil degrasse </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyson or the next fields medal winner in</v>

2486
02:14:49.531 --> 02:14:50.250
<v Speaker 2>mathematics.</v>

2487
02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:52.610
<v Speaker 1>I would not argue with you for one </v>
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

2488
02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I would also say that one of the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful things about human beings is </v>

2489
02:14:57.880 --> 02:15:02.471
<v Speaker 1>that we vary so much and that one person</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is just obsessed with playing the </v>

2490
02:15:02.571 --> 02:15:05.630
<v Speaker 1>trombone and to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck about trombones,</v>

2491
02:15:06.110 --> 02:15:11.110
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't be obsessed about </v>

2492
02:15:11.110 --> 02:15:12.290
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people love golf and they just want</v>

2493
02:15:12.291 --> 02:15:15.560
<v Speaker 1>to play it all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never played golf a day in my life.</v>

2494
02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Set Miniature Golf and just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

2495
02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:25.360
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad or good and I think </v>

2496
02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:29.350
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely some skills that you </v>

2497
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:31.511
<v Speaker 1>learned from mathematics that are hugely</v>
<v Speaker 1>significant if you want to go into type </v>

2498
02:15:31.511 --> 02:15:35.060
<v Speaker 1>of fields that you're involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me it's never been appealing,</v>

2499
02:15:35.420 --> 02:15:40.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that it was just difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also that it just,</v>

2500
02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:46.000
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I was at that time in that school </v>

2501
02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.260
<v Speaker 1>with those teachers and having the life </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that I had,</v>

2502
02:15:48.650 --> 02:15:51.230
<v Speaker 1>that was not what I was drawn to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I was drawn to,</v>

2503
02:15:51.231 --> 02:15:53.600
<v Speaker 1>his literature I was drawn to reading.</v>

2504
02:15:53.630 --> 02:15:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I was drawn to stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was drawn to possibilities and </v>

2505
02:15:58.630 --> 02:15:58.730
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was drawn to all those things.</v>

2506
02:15:58.731 --> 02:16:01.460
<v Speaker 1>You are an artist of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be.</v>

2507
02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I used to want to be a comic book </v>
<v Speaker 1>illustrator.</v>

2508
02:16:03.981 --> 02:16:06.050
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a big thing when I was young.</v>

2509
02:16:06.051 --> 02:16:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I was really into comic books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really into um,</v>

2510
02:16:10.940 --> 02:16:15.940
<v Speaker 1>a traditional comic books and also a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the horror comics from the 19 </v>

2511
02:16:15.981 --> 02:16:19.190
<v Speaker 1>seventies that black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like creepy and eerie.</v>

2512
02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see those things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creepy and eerie.</v>

2513
02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Like black and white?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2514
02:16:24.070 --> 02:16:29.070
<v Speaker 1>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were a comic book series that I'm </v>

2515
02:16:29.070 --> 02:16:30.890
<v Speaker 1>existed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like way back in the day was all there,</v>

2516
02:16:30.930 --> 02:16:35.930
<v Speaker 1>all horror and they were like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool illustrations and these wild </v>

2517
02:16:35.930 --> 02:16:37.420
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was comic books,</v>

2518
02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:39.610
<v Speaker 1>but they were all black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's creepy.</v>

2519
02:16:39.611 --> 02:16:41.620
<v Speaker 1>And Eerie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the actual name?</v>

2520
02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Erie and creepy.</v>

2521
02:16:43.421 --> 02:16:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Where the names like that was from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What year was that?</v>

2522
02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:50.730
<v Speaker 1>It says September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't say what year am I used </v>

2523
02:16:50.730 --> 02:16:52.930
<v Speaker 1>to get these when I was a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2524
02:16:52.931 --> 02:16:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I was like eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine years old.</v>

2525
02:16:54.491 --> 02:16:56.800
<v Speaker 1>And the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good and evil.</v>

2526
02:16:56.890 --> 02:16:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2527
02:16:57.930 --> 02:16:58.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

2528
02:16:58.421 --> 02:17:03.421
<v Speaker 1>they were my favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's a cover of them and like </v>

2529
02:17:03.421 --> 02:17:05.590
<v Speaker 1>have like covers that were done by like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Frank Frazetta,</v>

2530
02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Boris Vallejo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just really cool shit.</v>

2531
02:17:10.030 --> 02:17:12.100
<v Speaker 1>And I was fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love those.</v>

2532
02:17:12.101 --> 02:17:17.101
<v Speaker 1>When I was little I was always really </v>
<v Speaker 1>into horror movies and really into like </v>

2533
02:17:17.101 --> 02:17:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Bram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2534
02:17:17.620 --> 02:17:19.990
<v Speaker 1>look at this werewolf one that was one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my favorite ones.</v>

2535
02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:22.240
<v Speaker 1>That was a crazy werewolf that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2536
02:17:22.250 --> 02:17:24.310
<v Speaker 1>all fours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the hero?</v>

2537
02:17:24.311 --> 02:17:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Usually super heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody dies.</v>

2538
02:17:26.471 --> 02:17:28.170
<v Speaker 1>And those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the beautiful thing about it.</v>

2539
02:17:28.171 --> 02:17:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets fucked over.</v>

2540
02:17:29.650 --> 02:17:34.650
<v Speaker 1>There was nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the thing that I really liked </v>

2541
02:17:34.650 --> 02:17:34.840
<v Speaker 1>about them was that nobody made it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

2542
02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:38.650
<v Speaker 1>There was no one guy who figured it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rescued the woman and they wrote off</v>

2543
02:17:38.651 --> 02:17:43.651
<v Speaker 1>in the sunset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you turned the corner and they'd be </v>

2544
02:17:43.651 --> 02:17:46.351
<v Speaker 1>a fucking pack of wolves with glowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes were waiting to tear everybody </v>

2545
02:17:46.351 --> 02:17:46.540
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that'd be the end of the book.</v>

2546
02:17:46.890 --> 02:17:48.240
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2547
02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:49.870
<v Speaker 1>I was just really into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>illustrations.</v>

2548
02:17:49.871 --> 02:17:51.250
<v Speaker 1>I found that fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2549
02:17:51.251 --> 02:17:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I love those kind of horror movies and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>love those kinds of illness.</v>

2550
02:17:55.451 --> 02:17:57.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I wanted to do when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

2551
02:17:57.290 --> 02:18:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the education system is </v>

2552
02:18:02.290 --> 02:18:03.850
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've talked about creativity is </v>

2553
02:18:03.850 --> 02:18:03.850
<v Speaker 2>probably not as good at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2554
02:18:03.850 --> 02:18:08.560
<v Speaker 2>inspiring and feeding that creativity </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think math and wrestling can </v>

2555
02:18:09.231 --> 02:18:12.650
<v Speaker 2>be taught systematically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think creativity is something.</v>

2556
02:18:12.651 --> 02:18:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Well actually I had known nothing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2557
02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:19.720
<v Speaker 2>so I think it's harder to take somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you when you're young and say and </v>

2558
02:18:20.511 --> 02:18:23.320
<v Speaker 2>inspire you to pursue that fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever's inside.</v>

2559
02:18:23.321 --> 02:18:23.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2560
02:18:23.390 --> 02:18:27.010
<v Speaker 1>one of the best ways to inspire people </v>
<v Speaker 1>is by giving them,</v>

2561
02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:34.020
<v Speaker 1>giving them these alternatives that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>so uninteresting,</v>

2562
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:41.070
<v Speaker 1>like saying you're going to get a job </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling washing machines and you're </v>

2563
02:18:41.070 --> 02:18:41.070
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

2564
02:18:41.070 --> 02:18:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to figure out a way to not get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a job selling washing machines.</v>

2565
02:18:44.380 --> 02:18:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Like what some of the best motivations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've ever had have been terrible </v>

2566
02:18:49.380 --> 02:18:49.960
<v Speaker 1>jobs because you have these terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs and go,</v>

2567
02:18:49.961 --> 02:18:51.760
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

2568
02:18:51.790 --> 02:18:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to figure out a way to not do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2569
02:18:54.030 --> 02:18:59.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whether you want to call it add or </v>

2570
02:18:59.030 --> 02:19:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Adhd or whatever it is that makes kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>squirm in class.</v>

2571
02:19:01.630 --> 02:19:05.680
<v Speaker 1>I didn't score and every class I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>squirm and science class,</v>

2572
02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:08.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't squirm in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2573
02:19:08.590 --> 02:19:11.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an interesting subjects.</v>

2574
02:19:11.140 --> 02:19:16.140
<v Speaker 1>There's things that were interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that I would be locked in and </v>

2575
02:19:16.140 --> 02:19:18.090
<v Speaker 1>completely fascinated by and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>things where I just couldn't wait to run</v>

2576
02:19:18.091 --> 02:19:22.180
<v Speaker 1>out of that room and I don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason is,</v>

2577
02:19:22.181 --> 02:19:27.181
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that a lot of what we call</v>
<v Speaker 1>our education system is engineered for a</v>

2578
02:19:27.561 --> 02:19:32.561
<v Speaker 1>very specific result and that result is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to get a kid who can sit in </v>

2579
02:19:32.561 --> 02:19:37.541
<v Speaker 1>class and learn so that they could sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a job and perform and that for </v>

2580
02:19:38.631 --> 02:19:40.250
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just.</v>

2581
02:19:40.450 --> 02:19:42.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have the ideal childhood.</v>

2582
02:19:42.381 --> 02:19:47.381
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if I did I would be more inclined </v>

2583
02:19:47.381 --> 02:19:49.931
<v Speaker 1>to lean that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't want to do anything like </v>

2584
02:19:49.931 --> 02:19:50.120
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2585
02:19:50.121 --> 02:19:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't wait to get the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

2586
02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:55.700
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't ever have to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody like that again.</v>

2587
02:19:55.760 --> 02:19:58.220
<v Speaker 1>And then just a few years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2588
02:19:59.030 --> 02:20:00.800
<v Speaker 1>you graduated from high school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 18.</v>

2589
02:20:00.801 --> 02:20:02.930
<v Speaker 1>When I was 21,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a stand up comic and I was like,</v>

2590
02:20:02.931 --> 02:20:04.220
<v Speaker 1>I found it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

2591
02:20:04.700 --> 02:20:05.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2592
02:20:05.451 --> 02:20:10.451
<v Speaker 1>I found there's an actual job that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody told me about where you could </v>

2593
02:20:10.451 --> 02:20:12.530
<v Speaker 1>just make fun of Shit and people go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they pay money to hear you.</v>

2594
02:20:12.531 --> 02:20:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>create jokes and routines and bits.</v>

2595
02:20:16.130 --> 02:20:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You weren't terrified of standup getting</v>

2596
02:20:19.521 --> 02:20:20.450
<v Speaker 1>onstage and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2597
02:20:20.500 --> 02:20:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I was definitely nervous the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably more nervous and he was hard on</v>

2598
02:20:23.890 --> 02:20:24.550
<v Speaker 1>him fighting.</v>

2599
02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:26.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>

2600
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:29.720
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consequences aren't as grave,</v>

2601
02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:32.180
<v Speaker 1>but that's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they not know,</v>

2602
02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:36.020
<v Speaker 1>like embarrassment and you don't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>pummeled.</v>

2603
02:20:36.540 --> 02:20:37.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2604
02:20:37.690 --> 02:20:38.570
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2605
02:20:38.571 --> 02:20:43.571
<v Speaker 1>you could say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally it's probably more </v>

2606
02:20:43.571 --> 02:20:44.050
<v Speaker 1>devastating or as devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

2607
02:20:44.060 --> 02:20:47.150
<v Speaker 1>losing a fight is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it fucks you up for a long time.</v>

2608
02:20:47.151 --> 02:20:50.070
<v Speaker 1>You feel like shit for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2609
02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:55.300
<v Speaker 1>but then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you feel amazing for a long time </v>

2610
02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:55.300
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you kill onstage,</v>

2611
02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:56.600
<v Speaker 1>you only feel good for like an hour or </v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2612
02:20:56.601 --> 02:20:58.430
<v Speaker 1>and then it goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels normal.</v>

2613
02:20:58.930 --> 02:21:00.500
<v Speaker 1>It's just normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just life,</v>

2614
02:21:00.530 --> 02:21:05.530
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that it prepared me like </v>

2615
02:21:05.530 --> 02:21:08.610
<v Speaker 1>competing in martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fear of that and then the,</v>

2616
02:21:08.690 --> 02:21:13.690
<v Speaker 1>how hard it is to stand opposite another</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who's the same size as you,</v>

2617
02:21:15.921 --> 02:21:19.700
<v Speaker 1>who's equally well trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's also a martial arts expert.</v>

2618
02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:21.560
<v Speaker 1>And they ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you ready?</v>

2619
02:21:21.561 --> 02:21:26.561
<v Speaker 1>Are you ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You bow to each other and then they go </v>

2620
02:21:26.561 --> 02:21:26.561
<v Speaker 1>fight and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2621
02:21:26.561 --> 02:21:30.110
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that to me probably was like one of</v>

2622
02:21:30.111 --> 02:21:35.111
<v Speaker 1>the best prep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to do that from the time I was 15 </v>

2623
02:21:35.111 --> 02:21:36.800
<v Speaker 1>until I was 21 was probably the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation for anything.</v>

2624
02:21:36.801 --> 02:21:39.200
<v Speaker 1>That was difficult too because it was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking scary.</v>

2625
02:21:39.710 --> 02:21:44.710
<v Speaker 1>And then to go from that into standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it prepared me for standing up </v>

2626
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:45.800
<v Speaker 1>because I was already used to doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that were scary.</v>

2627
02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Now I seek scary things out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Thi,</v>

2628
02:21:48.540 --> 02:21:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I seek difficult things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2629
02:21:50.840 --> 02:21:53.540
<v Speaker 1>picking up the bow and learning that </v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2630
02:21:53.541 --> 02:21:55.340
<v Speaker 1>archery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really difficult.</v>

2631
02:21:56.030 --> 02:22:01.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some reasons why I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted even to playing pool pools.</v>

2632
02:22:01.250 --> 02:22:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to control your </v>

2633
02:22:06.250 --> 02:22:08.120
<v Speaker 1>nerves and high pressure situations so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's,</v>

2634
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:10.640
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some benefits of that,</v>

2635
02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:12.680
<v Speaker 1>but here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it goes back to what you were saying</v>

2636
02:22:12.681 --> 02:22:15.200
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of all this stuff,</v>

2637
02:22:15.230 --> 02:22:18.160
<v Speaker 1>like when you were saying that scarcity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2638
02:22:18.190 --> 02:22:23.190
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's real value in scarcity and that </v>

2639
02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:26.531
<v Speaker 1>there's real value in struggle and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much of all this is just engineered into</v>

2640
02:22:28.411 --> 02:22:33.411
<v Speaker 1>our human system that it has given us </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tools and the incentive to make it </v>

2641
02:22:34.891 --> 02:22:36.840
<v Speaker 1>to 2018 with the human species.</v>

2642
02:22:37.210 --> 02:22:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's whoever the engineer is,</v>

2643
02:22:39.700 --> 02:22:44.500
<v Speaker 2>whether it's God or nature or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's engineered and somehow that</v>

2644
02:22:44.620 --> 02:22:49.620
<v Speaker 2>we get to think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you try to create an artificial </v>

2645
02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:51.340
<v Speaker 2>intelligence system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you imagine what's a perfect system</v>

2646
02:22:51.610 --> 02:22:53.560
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we talked about this with,</v>

2647
02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:56.110
<v Speaker 2>with the lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the perfect system for you?</v>

2648
02:22:56.440 --> 02:23:00.250
<v Speaker 2>If you had to really put down on paper </v>
<v Speaker 2>and engineer,</v>

2649
02:23:00.251 --> 02:23:05.251
<v Speaker 2>what's the experience of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you start to realize it actually </v>

2650
02:23:05.251 --> 02:23:09.001
<v Speaker 2>looks a lot like your current life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the problem that companies </v>

2651
02:23:09.001 --> 02:23:11.980
<v Speaker 2>are facing like Amazon and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create Alexa.</v>

2652
02:23:12.910 --> 02:23:17.910
<v Speaker 2>What do you want from Alexa?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want a tool that says what the </v>

2653
02:23:17.910 --> 02:23:20.290
<v Speaker 2>weather is or do you want to Alexa to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2654
02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:23.800
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to talk to you right now.</v>

2655
02:23:25.350 --> 02:23:25.810
<v Speaker 2>I Have</v>

2656
02:23:26.300 --> 02:23:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Alexa where you have to work or over </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Alexa,</v>

2657
02:23:28.641 --> 02:23:29.750
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>

2658
02:23:29.751 --> 02:23:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2659
02:23:30.750 --> 02:23:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was rude,</v>

2660
02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I was insensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was tired of the commute was really </v>

2661
02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:38.330
<v Speaker 1>rough and they shouldn't be like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing somebody else.</v>

2662
02:23:40.490 --> 02:23:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Avatar depression?</v>

2663
02:23:44.020 --> 02:23:49.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie Avatar and depression is a </v>

2664
02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:49.020
<v Speaker 2>psychological effect after the movies.</v>

2665
02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a real term that people were </v>

2666
02:23:53.790 --> 02:23:56.131
<v Speaker 1>using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that psychologists were using because </v>

2667
02:23:56.131 --> 02:23:56.131
<v Speaker 1>people would see the movie Avatar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I loved.</v>

2668
02:23:56.290 --> 02:23:57.100
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2669
02:23:57.101 --> 02:24:00.250
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking pocahontas was blue people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to those people.</v>

2670
02:24:00.251 --> 02:24:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>

2671
02:24:02.110 --> 02:24:04.000
<v Speaker 1>You want to talk about suspension of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disbelief.</v>

2672
02:24:04.001 --> 02:24:09.001
<v Speaker 1>That to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie was the ultimate suspension </v>

2673
02:24:09.001 --> 02:24:09.001
<v Speaker 1>of disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that movie.</v>

2674
02:24:09.001 --> 02:24:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

2675
02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:12.550
<v Speaker 1>I know James Cameron is working on like </v>
<v Speaker 1>15 sequels right now.</v>

2676
02:24:12.551 --> 02:24:15.460
<v Speaker 1>All simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish that motherfucker would dole them</v>

2677
02:24:15.461 --> 02:24:16.500
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like a,</v>

2678
02:24:16.501 --> 02:24:20.260
<v Speaker 1>a crack dealer that gets you hooked once</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you just waiting outside in the</v>

2679
02:24:20.261 --> 02:24:20.870
<v Speaker 1>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shiver.</v>

2680
02:24:20.871 --> 02:24:22.650
<v Speaker 1>And for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2681
02:24:23.530 --> 02:24:28.530
<v Speaker 1>avatar depression was a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>term that psychologists were using to </v>

2682
02:24:29.651 --> 02:24:34.651
<v Speaker 1>describe this mass influx of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw that movie and were so enthralled by</v>

2683
02:24:35.771 --> 02:24:40.771
<v Speaker 1>the way the Navi lived in Pandora that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they came back to this stupid to leave.</v>

2684
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:46.060
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to be like the blue guy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Avatar.</v>

2685
02:24:46.210 --> 02:24:48.380
<v Speaker 1>And it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

2686
02:24:48.740 --> 02:24:53.740
<v Speaker 1>there was a mechanism in that film where</v>
<v Speaker 1>this regular person became a Navi.</v>

2687
02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:58.990
<v Speaker 1>He became through the Avatar and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually that tree of life or whatever</v>

2688
02:24:58.991 --> 02:25:02.710
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they transferred his essence into this,</v>

2689
02:25:03.130 --> 02:25:06.220
<v Speaker 1>create this avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he became one of them.</v>

2690
02:25:06.610 --> 02:25:11.610
<v Speaker 1>He became one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He absorbed their culture and it was </v>

2691
02:25:11.610 --> 02:25:14.731
<v Speaker 1>very much like our romanticized versions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the native Americans that they lived </v>

2692
02:25:16.241 --> 02:25:19.660
<v Speaker 1>in symbiotic relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

2693
02:25:19.990 --> 02:25:24.990
<v Speaker 1>They only took what they needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had spiritual connection to their </v>

2694
02:25:24.990 --> 02:25:29.671
<v Speaker 1>food and to nature and to the just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their existence was was noble and it was</v>

2695
02:25:32.111 --> 02:25:37.111
<v Speaker 1>honorable and it wasn't selfish and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was powerful and it was spiritual and </v>

2696
02:25:37.111 --> 02:25:38.320
<v Speaker 1>that we're missing these things.</v>

2697
02:25:38.410 --> 02:25:43.410
<v Speaker 4>We're missing these things and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>we are better at romanticizing them and </v>

2698
02:25:43.410 --> 02:25:45.310
<v Speaker 4>craving them as opposed to living them </v>
<v Speaker 4>as.</v>

2699
02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:50.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at movies like happy people </v>

2700
02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:50.930
<v Speaker 4>with the life and the tiger den.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Live life in a tie.</v>

2701
02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:52.020
<v Speaker 4>GMS,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2702
02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:56.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm rushing center.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Herzog's film is part of you wants to be</v>

2703
02:25:56.561 --> 02:25:57.010
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2704
02:25:57.011 --> 02:26:02.011
<v Speaker 4>I want to be out there in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>focusing on simple survival,</v>

2705
02:26:02.350 --> 02:26:05.530
<v Speaker 4>setting traps for animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cooking some soup,</v>

2706
02:26:05.970 --> 02:26:10.540
<v Speaker 4>a family around you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just kind of focusing on the basics.</v>

2707
02:26:10.990 --> 02:26:13.360
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm the same way,</v>

2708
02:26:13.390 --> 02:26:16.300
<v Speaker 4>like I go out hiking and I go out in </v>
<v Speaker 4>nature.</v>

2709
02:26:16.301 --> 02:26:18.940
<v Speaker 4>I would love to pick up hunting and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>

2710
02:26:18.941 --> 02:26:21.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm crave that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you just put me in the forest,</v>

2711
02:26:21.910 --> 02:26:26.910
<v Speaker 4>I'll probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be like I'm taking your phone away </v>

2712
02:26:26.910 --> 02:26:26.910
<v Speaker 4>and you're staying here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2713
02:26:26.910 --> 02:26:31.621
<v Speaker 4>You never go into return to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>facebook and your twitter and your and </v>

2714
02:26:31.621 --> 02:26:31.900
<v Speaker 4>your robots.</v>

2715
02:26:32.530 --> 02:26:36.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I'll be so romantic </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that notion anymore.</v>

2716
02:26:37.450 --> 02:26:41.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't know either,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's also the genie in the</v>

2717
02:26:41.501 --> 02:26:43.570
<v Speaker 4>bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right discussion.</v>

2718
02:26:44.030 --> 02:26:46.600
<v Speaker 4>I think that genie's out of the bottle </v>
<v Speaker 4>for so long.</v>

2719
02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:47.680
<v Speaker 4>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what am I?</v>

2720
02:26:47.681 --> 02:26:48.520
<v Speaker 4>Facebook?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What have I got?</v>

2721
02:26:48.521 --> 02:26:51.250
<v Speaker 4>Some messages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me check my email real quick.</v>

2722
02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:51.640
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2723
02:26:51.641 --> 02:26:52.630
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're in the forest.</v>

2724
02:26:52.900 --> 02:26:55.750
<v Speaker 4>There's no wifi out here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No wifi ever.</v>

2725
02:26:56.050 --> 02:27:00.070
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do people get your porn porn?</v>

2726
02:27:00.370 --> 02:27:03.250
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's another understudied.</v>

2727
02:27:03.970 --> 02:27:05.020
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not an expert,</v>

2728
02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:09.160
<v Speaker 4>but the impact of Internet pornography </v>
<v Speaker 4>on culture.</v>

2729
02:27:09.310 --> 02:27:10.020
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2730
02:27:10.030 --> 02:27:15.030
<v Speaker 4>it's significant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also ignored to a certain extent and</v>

2731
02:27:15.131 --> 02:27:16.990
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if not ignored,</v>

2732
02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:22.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely purposefully left out of the </v>

2733
02:27:22.901 --> 02:27:23.890
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2734
02:27:23.891 --> 02:27:28.780
<v Speaker 4>There's a another phd student,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a person from Google came to give a tech</v>

2735
02:27:28.781 --> 02:27:33.781
<v Speaker 4>talk and he opened by saying 90 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>of you in the audience have this month,</v>

2736
02:27:34.030 --> 02:27:36.220
<v Speaker 4>Google the pornographic term in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>search engine,</v>

2737
02:27:37.270 --> 02:27:42.270
<v Speaker 4>and it was really a great opener because</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were just all really </v>

2738
02:27:42.270 --> 02:27:46.861
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable because we just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hide it away into this,</v>

2739
02:27:48.010 --> 02:27:53.010
<v Speaker 4>but it certainly has an impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a suppression aspect to </v>

2740
02:27:53.010 --> 02:27:53.010
<v Speaker 4>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's unhealthy.</v>

2741
02:27:53.010 --> 02:27:53.010
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

2742
02:27:53.250 --> 02:27:58.250
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have a suppression of our sexuality </v>

2743
02:27:58.250 --> 02:27:58.250
<v Speaker 4>because we think that somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's negative,</v>

2744
02:27:58.440 --> 02:27:59.200
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2745
02:27:59.201 --> 02:28:03.310
<v Speaker 4>and especially for women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean for women like men</v>

2746
02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:08.390
<v Speaker 1>and who is a sexual conqueror is thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a stud.</v>

2747
02:28:08.690 --> 02:28:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a woman who seeks out a multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>desirable sexual partners is thought to </v>

2748
02:28:15.741 --> 02:28:18.710
<v Speaker 1>be troubled or something wrong with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2749
02:28:18.711 --> 02:28:23.711
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're criticized there use terms like </v>

2750
02:28:23.711 --> 02:28:24.500
<v Speaker 1>we used earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like slut or whore,</v>

2751
02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:25.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

2752
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:28.610
<v Speaker 1>you call a man a mail slot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll start laughing.</v>

2753
02:28:28.660 --> 02:28:29.990
<v Speaker 1>He up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's me,</v>

2754
02:28:29.991 --> 02:28:32.420
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like men don't give a fuck about that.</v>

2755
02:28:32.421 --> 02:28:34.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not stigmatized,</v>

2756
02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:36.440
<v Speaker 1>but somehow or another through our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

2757
02:28:36.441 --> 02:28:41.441
<v Speaker 1>it's stigmatized for women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the idea of masturbation is </v>

2758
02:28:41.441 --> 02:28:41.441
<v Speaker 1>stigmatized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

2759
02:28:41.441 --> 02:28:46.241
<v Speaker 1>all these different things that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our puritan roots of our society starts </v>

2760
02:28:46.481 --> 02:28:51.481
<v Speaker 1>showing and our religious ideology </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts showing when we discuss our,</v>

2761
02:28:53.930 --> 02:28:56.080
<v Speaker 1>our issues that we have with sex and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pornography.</v>

2762
02:28:56.110 --> 02:28:57.850
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for me,</v>

2763
02:28:57.851 --> 02:29:02.851
<v Speaker 2>this is something I think about a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit because my dream is to create an </v>

2764
02:29:03.671 --> 02:29:08.671
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human centered artificial </v>

2765
02:29:08.671 --> 02:29:08.671
<v Speaker 2>intelligence system that provides a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

2766
02:29:08.671 --> 02:29:10.570
<v Speaker 2>meaningful connection with another human</v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

2767
02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:16.440
<v Speaker 2>And you have to consider the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pornography or sex dolls will be part of</v>

2768
02:29:18.491 --> 02:29:23.491
<v Speaker 2>the journey somehow in society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something you're the dummy they'll be </v>

2769
02:29:23.491 --> 02:29:27.211
<v Speaker 2>using for martial arts would likely to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in our development of,</v>

2770
02:29:27.911 --> 02:29:28.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sex robots.</v>

2771
02:29:28.991 --> 02:29:33.991
<v Speaker 2>And we have to think about what's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>impact of those kinds of robots on </v>

2772
02:29:33.991 --> 02:29:33.991
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

2773
02:29:33.991 --> 02:29:37.970
<v Speaker 1>But women in particular are violently </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to sex robots.</v>

2774
02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I've read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2775
02:29:38.781 --> 02:29:43.781
<v Speaker 1>read a couple articles written by women </v>
<v Speaker 1>about sex robots and the possibility of </v>

2776
02:29:43.911 --> 02:29:47.420
<v Speaker 1>future sex robots and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say violently,</v>

2777
02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:52.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's always negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is the idea that men would want to </v>

2778
02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:56.141
<v Speaker 1>have sex with some beautiful thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's programmed to love them as </v>

2779
02:29:56.141 --> 02:30:00.881
<v Speaker 1>opposed to earning the love of a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't hear that same </v>

2780
02:30:00.881 --> 02:30:03.500
<v Speaker 1>interpretation from men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from men.</v>

2781
02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:08.620
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be that there's a thought </v>

2782
02:30:08.620 --> 02:30:08.690
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's Kinda Gross,</v>

2783
02:30:08.930 --> 02:30:11.260
<v Speaker 1>but also that it's inevitable and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2784
02:30:11.300 --> 02:30:12.740
<v Speaker 1>and then there's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2785
02:30:12.910 --> 02:30:17.910
<v Speaker 1>like sort of nod to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how crazy would that be if you had </v>

2786
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:21.371
<v Speaker 1>the perfect woman like the red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman in the red dress in the </v>

2787
02:30:21.371 --> 02:30:21.371
<v Speaker 1>matrix?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2788
02:30:21.371 --> 02:30:22.370
<v Speaker 1>But it comes over to your house and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's perfect</v>

2789
02:30:22.500 --> 02:30:24.390
<v Speaker 2>because you're not thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative,</v>

2790
02:30:24.391 --> 02:30:29.391
<v Speaker 2>which is a male robot doll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which will now be able to satisfy your </v>

2791
02:30:29.391 --> 02:30:34.191
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend wife better than you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'll hear from guys a lot more</v>

2792
02:30:34.501 --> 02:30:34.860
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

2793
02:30:35.650 --> 02:30:39.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe or maybe start competing with her.</v>

2794
02:30:39.371 --> 02:30:42.430
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's always yelling at me.</v>

2795
02:30:42.660 --> 02:30:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Let her yell at the robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know he's not going to care.</v>

2796
02:30:45.910 --> 02:30:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Then that robot turns into grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2797
02:30:48.041 --> 02:30:50.830
<v Speaker 1>And maybe she can just go ahead and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat with the robot.</v>

2798
02:30:50.831 --> 02:30:52.730
<v Speaker 1>He's not even even care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

2799
02:30:53.350 --> 02:30:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Just sit around each cheetos all day and</v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming at him.</v>

2800
02:30:55.451 --> 02:30:56.350
<v Speaker 1>He's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's your,</v>

2801
02:30:56.430 --> 02:30:57.850
<v Speaker 1>your slave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2802
02:30:59.570 --> 02:31:01.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could work both ways,</v>

2803
02:31:01.331 --> 02:31:06.331
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can work the same way that a man </v>

2804
02:31:06.331 --> 02:31:06.331
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2805
02:31:06.331 --> 02:31:11.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman would see a man that is </v>

2806
02:31:11.310 --> 02:31:12.480
<v Speaker 1>interested in a sex robot to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting,</v>

2807
02:31:12.490 --> 02:31:17.490
<v Speaker 1>pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A man could see the same thing in a </v>

2808
02:31:17.490 --> 02:31:17.770
<v Speaker 1>woman that's interested in a sex robot </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2809
02:31:17.771 --> 02:31:18.280
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2810
02:31:18.300 --> 02:31:23.300
<v Speaker 1>that is that what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do some crude thing that just wants </v>

2811
02:31:23.300 --> 02:31:23.970
<v Speaker 1>physical pleasure and you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>care about a real,</v>

2812
02:31:23.971 --> 02:31:27.600
<v Speaker 1>actual emotional connection to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological human being like,</v>

2813
02:31:27.601 --> 02:31:32.601
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you're not my kind of woman </v>

2814
02:31:32.601 --> 02:31:32.601
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

2815
02:31:32.601 --> 02:31:33.070
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if done well,</v>

2816
02:31:33.130 --> 02:31:35.710
<v Speaker 3>those are the kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of threats of Ai,</v>

2817
02:31:36.070 --> 02:31:41.070
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can change the fabric of society </v>

2818
02:31:41.070 --> 02:31:41.070
<v Speaker 3>because like I'm old school in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

2819
02:31:41.070 --> 02:31:41.640
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2820
02:31:41.790 --> 02:31:43.810
<v Speaker 3>I like monogamy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

2821
02:31:44.400 --> 02:31:46.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say that because you don't have</v>

2822
02:31:46.151 --> 02:31:50.150
<v Speaker 3>a girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>monogamy one is,</v>

2823
02:31:50.310 --> 02:31:55.310
<v Speaker 3>one is better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well now the real reason and have a a </v>

2824
02:31:55.310 --> 02:31:59.191
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend is because it is fascinated </v>
<v Speaker 3>with people like you would with the </v>

2825
02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:00.640
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2826
02:32:01.020 --> 02:32:06.020
<v Speaker 3>Is a huge challenge because because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>how much your romantic I am because how </v>

2827
02:32:06.020 --> 02:32:09.841
<v Speaker 3>much I care about people around me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's a significant </v>

2828
02:32:09.841 --> 02:32:10.720
<v Speaker 3>investment in time and also the amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of work that you do.</v>

2829
02:32:10.940 --> 02:32:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're dedicated to a passion like </v>

2830
02:32:15.940 --> 02:32:19.511
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence and the sheer </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of fucking studying and research</v>

2831
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:24.350
<v Speaker 3>and programming to certain disciplines </v>
<v Speaker 3>in which you have to.</v>

2832
02:32:24.920 --> 02:32:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Certain disciplines require.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Steven pressfield talks about </v>

2833
02:32:29.920 --> 02:32:29.920
<v Speaker 3>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get pretty far with two,</v>

2834
02:32:29.920 --> 02:32:31.970
<v Speaker 3>three hours a day when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>programming,</v>

2835
02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.980
<v Speaker 3>when you see a lot of the engineering </v>
<v Speaker 3>tasks,</v>

2836
02:32:34.400 --> 02:32:36.890
<v Speaker 3>they just take up hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just hard,</v>

2837
02:32:37.040 --> 02:32:41.790
<v Speaker 3>which is why I really wanted one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons I may disagree with all,</v>

2838
02:32:41.820 --> 02:32:46.820
<v Speaker 3>well a bunch of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's an inspiration because I think </v>

2839
02:32:46.820 --> 02:32:46.820
<v Speaker 3>he's a pretty good dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2840
02:32:47.220 --> 02:32:52.220
<v Speaker 3>And he finds the time for his sons while</v>
<v Speaker 3>being probably an order of magnitude </v>

2841
02:32:52.431 --> 02:32:55.790
<v Speaker 3>busier than I am and it's fascinating to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me how that's possible.</v>

2842
02:32:56.240 --> 02:32:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you have children,</v>

2843
02:32:58.970 --> 02:33:01.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean there obviously are people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are bad dads,</v>

2844
02:33:01.940 --> 02:33:06.110
<v Speaker 3>but once you have children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life shifts in an almost.</v>

2845
02:33:07.260 --> 02:33:07.730
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

2846
02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:11.610
<v Speaker 1>indescribable way because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're different.</v>

2847
02:33:11.611 --> 02:33:16.611
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that your life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different when you have a child like </v>

2848
02:33:16.611 --> 02:33:16.680
<v Speaker 1>your Deli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There hasn't been a moment while we were</v>

2849
02:33:16.681 --> 02:33:19.260
<v Speaker 1>having this conversation that I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>been thinking about my children,</v>

2850
02:33:19.610 --> 02:33:21.240
<v Speaker 1>thinking about what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they are.</v>

2851
02:33:21.241 --> 02:33:24.300
<v Speaker 1>It's always running in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a part of life.</v>

2852
02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:29.680
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're connected to these people that </v>

2853
02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:33.411
<v Speaker 1>you love so much and they rely on you </v>
<v Speaker 1>for guidance and for,</v>

2854
02:33:34.290 --> 02:33:39.290
<v Speaker 1>for warmth and affection and but how did</v>
<v Speaker 1>you left have to change your life?</v>

2855
02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:42.150
<v Speaker 1>You just changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2856
02:33:42.151 --> 02:33:43.830
<v Speaker 1>When you see the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you change.</v>

2857
02:33:43.890 --> 02:33:45.540
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start feeding them,</v>

2858
02:33:45.541 --> 02:33:46.920
<v Speaker 1>you change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you hold them,</v>

2859
02:33:46.921 --> 02:33:47.940
<v Speaker 1>you change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

2860
02:33:48.260 --> 02:33:50.820
<v Speaker 1>you hold their hand while they walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you change.</v>

2861
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:52.630
<v Speaker 1>When they ask you questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you change.</v>

2862
02:33:52.631 --> 02:33:54.330
<v Speaker 1>When they laugh and Giggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you change.</v>

2863
02:33:54.331 --> 02:33:56.610
<v Speaker 1>When they smack in the face and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend to fall down,</v>

2864
02:33:56.611 --> 02:33:58.200
<v Speaker 1>they laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you change,</v>

2865
02:33:59.110 --> 02:34:00.500
<v Speaker 1>you just change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2866
02:34:00.540 --> 02:34:03.000
<v Speaker 1>You change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You become a different thing,</v>

2867
02:34:03.001 --> 02:34:08.001
<v Speaker 1>you become a dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you almost can't help but the people </v>

2868
02:34:08.001 --> 02:34:08.700
<v Speaker 1>do help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but though that's what's sad.</v>

2869
02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Some people resist it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2870
02:34:10.420 --> 02:34:13.830
<v Speaker 1>I know people that have been terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible parents.</v>

2871
02:34:14.130 --> 02:34:19.130
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd rather stay out all night and </v>

2872
02:34:19.130 --> 02:34:19.990
<v Speaker 1>never come and they don't want to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>care of their kids and they get,</v>

2873
02:34:20.450 --> 02:34:25.450
<v Speaker 1>they split up with the wife or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend who's got the kid and they </v>

2874
02:34:25.450 --> 02:34:27.790
<v Speaker 1>don't give child support and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really common theme and I mean there's a</v>

2875
02:34:27.791 --> 02:34:30.130
<v Speaker 1>lot of men out there that don't pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>child support.</v>

2876
02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:32.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark thing.</v>

2877
02:34:33.220 --> 02:34:36.340
<v Speaker 1>You have a child out there that needs </v>
<v Speaker 1>food and you don't want.</v>

2878
02:34:36.341 --> 02:34:39.220
<v Speaker 1>You're so fucking selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to provide resources.</v>

2879
02:34:39.340 --> 02:34:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Not only do you not want to be there for</v>
<v Speaker 1>companionship,</v>

2880
02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:45.130
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to provide resources to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay for the child's food.</v>

2881
02:34:45.370 --> 02:34:47.020
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel responsible for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2882
02:34:47.021 --> 02:34:52.021
<v Speaker 1>that was my case when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad didn't pay child support and we </v>

2883
02:34:52.021 --> 02:34:56.311
<v Speaker 1>were very poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why we were so </v>

2884
02:34:56.311 --> 02:34:58.060
<v Speaker 1>poor and I know other people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that same experience,</v>

2885
02:34:58.570 --> 02:35:03.570
<v Speaker 1>so it's not everyone that becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>father or that impregnates I should say </v>

2886
02:35:04.481 --> 02:35:08.440
<v Speaker 1>a woman and becomes a and the other side</v>
<v Speaker 1>is true too.</v>

2887
02:35:08.441 --> 02:35:11.680
<v Speaker 1>There's women that are terrible mothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason.</v>

2888
02:35:11.900 --> 02:35:14.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe they're broken </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically.</v>

2889
02:35:14.111 --> 02:35:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they have mental health issues </v>
<v Speaker 1>when whatever it is.</v>

2890
02:35:16.660 --> 02:35:20.230
<v Speaker 1>There's some women that are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible moms and it's sad,</v>

2891
02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:23.110
<v Speaker 1>but it makes you appreciate women that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are great mom so much more.</v>

2892
02:35:23.700 --> 02:35:28.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I see guys like you at the </v>

2893
02:35:28.700 --> 02:35:30.880
<v Speaker 1>inspiration is some looking for sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>structural.</v>

2894
02:35:30.910 --> 02:35:33.460
<v Speaker 1>What's the process to then fit people </v>
<v Speaker 1>into your life?</v>

2895
02:35:33.820 --> 02:35:37.660
<v Speaker 1>But what I hear is when it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just do.</v>

2896
02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:39.430
<v Speaker 1>You can always put that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2897
02:35:39.431 --> 02:35:40.780
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not living in a book.</v>

2898
02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:43.090
<v Speaker 1>We're not living in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't always happen.</v>

2899
02:35:43.390 --> 02:35:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to decide that you want it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen and you got to go looking for </v>

2900
02:35:48.390 --> 02:35:50.830
<v Speaker 1>it because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just be older and still alone.</v>

2901
02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Time goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of my friends that have never had </v>

2902
02:35:55.860 --> 02:35:55.860
<v Speaker 1>kids and now they're in their fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean comedians.</v>

2903
02:35:56.320 --> 02:35:59.080
<v Speaker 1>You have to be on the road a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just on the road.</v>

2904
02:35:59.110 --> 02:36:02.250
<v Speaker 1>You have to be obsessed with comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's.</v>

2905
02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:07.280
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're always writing new jokes because </v>

2906
02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:10.471
<v Speaker 1>you're always reading a new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you put out a special </v>

2907
02:36:10.471 --> 02:36:10.471
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put like.</v>

2908
02:36:10.471 --> 02:36:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I just did a Netflix special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's out now,</v>

2909
02:36:10.631 --> 02:36:13.480
<v Speaker 1>so I'll really have like a half hour new</v>
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

2910
02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:16.800
<v Speaker 1>That's it and I'm great by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

2911
02:36:16.801 --> 02:36:20.710
<v Speaker 1>The first special I've washed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was actually really weird,</v>

2912
02:36:20.711 --> 02:36:25.300
<v Speaker 1>decided to go on a tangent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've listened to you quite a bit,</v>

2913
02:36:25.301 --> 02:36:30.301
<v Speaker 1>but I've never looked at you doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy and it was so different because </v>

2914
02:36:30.750 --> 02:36:34.480
<v Speaker 1>here you're just like Improv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a jazz musician here.</v>

2915
02:36:34.481 --> 02:36:37.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like a regular conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The standard was special.</v>

2916
02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:41.260
<v Speaker 1>It was clear like that's like everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>is perfect.</v>

2917
02:36:41.261 --> 02:36:46.261
<v Speaker 1>The timing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like watching you do a different </v>

2918
02:36:46.261 --> 02:36:46.261
<v Speaker 1>art almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is kind of interesting.</v>

2919
02:36:46.261 --> 02:36:48.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like a song or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't.</v>

2920
02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:52.720
<v Speaker 1>There's some roofing to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some improvisation to it,</v>

2921
02:36:52.750 --> 02:36:55.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's also there's a very clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure to it,</v>

2922
02:36:55.630 --> 02:37:00.630
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it's so time intensive and you </v>

2923
02:37:00.630 --> 02:37:04.261
<v Speaker 1>have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be obsessed with it to </v>

2924
02:37:04.261 --> 02:37:06.421
<v Speaker 1>continue to do something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for some people that travel and the </v>

2925
02:37:06.521 --> 02:37:11.521
<v Speaker 1>road that takes priority over all things</v>
<v Speaker 1>including relationships and then you </v>

2926
02:37:11.521 --> 02:37:13.180
<v Speaker 1>never really settled down and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>

2927
02:37:13.270 --> 02:37:15.910
<v Speaker 1>You never have a significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with someone that you could</v>

2928
02:37:15.911 --> 02:37:20.911
<v Speaker 1>have a child with and I know many </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends that are like that and I know </v>

2929
02:37:20.911 --> 02:37:22.790
<v Speaker 1>friends who have gotten vasectomies </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't want it.</v>

2930
02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:26.120
<v Speaker 1>They liked this life and there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with that either.</v>

2931
02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:31.720
<v Speaker 1>I always was upset by this notion that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to be a full and complete </v>

2932
02:37:32.331 --> 02:37:33.950
<v Speaker 1>adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a child.</v>

2933
02:37:34.250 --> 02:37:39.250
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think even as a parent where I </v>

2934
02:37:39.250 --> 02:37:40.880
<v Speaker 1>think it's probably one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant things in my life,</v>

2935
02:37:41.100 --> 02:37:42.590
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reject that notion.</v>

2936
02:37:42.591 --> 02:37:47.591
<v Speaker 1>I think you could absolutely be a fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed person and an amazing </v>

2937
02:37:47.591 --> 02:37:51.760
<v Speaker 1>influence in society and amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>contributor to your culture and your </v>

2938
02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:54.290
<v Speaker 1>community without ever having a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you're a man or a woman.</v>

2939
02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:57.380
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that it's not as silly.</v>

2940
02:37:57.410 --> 02:38:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all different in so many different</v>

2941
02:38:00.111 --> 02:38:00.980
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2942
02:38:00.981 --> 02:38:02.780
<v Speaker 1>and we contribute in so many different </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

2943
02:38:03.470 --> 02:38:06.080
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with mathematics is going to be</v>

2944
02:38:06.081 --> 02:38:07.460
<v Speaker 1>people that are obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>

2945
02:38:07.461 --> 02:38:12.461
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with music and they don't all </v>

2946
02:38:12.461 --> 02:38:15.161
<v Speaker 1>have to be the same puck in person </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you really don't have enough </v>

2947
02:38:15.161 --> 02:38:15.161
<v Speaker 1>time for it to be the same person you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2948
02:38:15.161 --> 02:38:19.841
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be people that love </v>

2949
02:38:19.841 --> 02:38:21.581
<v Speaker 1>having children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love being a dad or loved being a </v>

2950
02:38:21.581 --> 02:38:23.741
<v Speaker 1>mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's going to be people that </v>

2951
02:38:23.741 --> 02:38:23.741
<v Speaker 1>don't want to have nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2952
02:38:23.741 --> 02:38:23.741
<v Speaker 1>And they get snipped early and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2953
02:38:23.741 --> 02:38:27.941
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to smoke cigarettes and drink </v>

2954
02:38:27.941 --> 02:38:28.280
<v Speaker 1>booze and I'm going to fly around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and talk shit.</v>

2955
02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:33.520
<v Speaker 1>And those people are okay to like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way we interact with each other.</v>

2956
02:38:34.311 --> 02:38:39.311
<v Speaker 1>That's most important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think the way human </v>

2957
02:38:39.311 --> 02:38:42.980
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we form bonds and friendships,</v>

2958
02:38:42.981 --> 02:38:46.250
<v Speaker 1>the way we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we contribute to each other's lives,</v>

2959
02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:47.900
<v Speaker 1>the way we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2960
02:38:47.930 --> 02:38:52.610
<v Speaker 1>we find our passion and create those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are what's really important.</v>

2961
02:38:53.740 --> 02:38:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's also an element just looking</v>

2962
02:38:55.871 --> 02:38:57.520
<v Speaker 2>at my parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they got,</v>

2963
02:38:57.521 --> 02:38:59.500
<v Speaker 2>they're still together to garden </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

2964
02:38:59.501 --> 02:39:01.090
<v Speaker 2>What it means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standards.</v>

2965
02:39:01.091 --> 02:39:03.790
<v Speaker 2>You get together when you're like 20 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>I should know this,</v>

2966
02:39:03.791 --> 02:39:08.791
<v Speaker 2>but 23 slash 20 whatever young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there is an element there where you </v>

2967
02:39:08.791 --> 02:39:11.740
<v Speaker 2>don't want to be too rational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just want to just dive in.</v>

2968
02:39:11.890 --> 02:39:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should you be an MMA fighter?</v>

2969
02:39:14.050 --> 02:39:16.290
<v Speaker 2>Should you be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2970
02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:18.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm an academia now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2971
02:39:18.630 --> 02:39:22.150
<v Speaker 2>so I'm a research scientist at Mit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pay is much,</v>

2972
02:39:22.151 --> 02:39:26.110
<v Speaker 2>much lower than all the offers I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting nonstop as it rational.</v>

2973
02:39:26.470 --> 02:39:29.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what your passion</v>

2974
02:39:29.080 --> 02:39:31.060
<v Speaker 1>it is doing what you're doing currently.</v>

2975
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:32.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>

2976
02:39:32.571 --> 02:39:33.110
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

2977
02:39:33.150 --> 02:39:38.150
<v Speaker 1>what are the other offers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of other jobs and are </v>

2978
02:39:38.150 --> 02:39:38.150
<v Speaker 1>they appealing in any way?</v>

2979
02:39:38.150 --> 02:39:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2980
02:39:38.711 --> 02:39:40.570
<v Speaker 2>they're appealing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

2981
02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:44.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm making a decision that's similar to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually getting married,</v>

2982
02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:49.390
<v Speaker 2>which is so the officer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I shouldn't call them out,</v>

2983
02:39:49.391 --> 02:39:52.930
<v Speaker 2>but google phase with the usual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the usual ai research,</v>

2984
02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:57.960
<v Speaker 2>pretty high positions and the I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just something in me that says I the </v>

2985
02:40:02.470 --> 02:40:06.220
<v Speaker 2>edge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chaos of this environment and mit is</v>

2986
02:40:06.221 --> 02:40:09.970
<v Speaker 2>something I'm drawn to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense so I could do what</v>

2987
02:40:09.971 --> 02:40:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm passionate about on a lot of places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just kind of dive in.</v>

2988
02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:18.280
<v Speaker 2>Navis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a sense that a lot of our culture </v>

2989
02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:18.960
<v Speaker 2>creates that momentum and you just kinda</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to go with it.</v>

2990
02:40:19.290 --> 02:40:23.880
<v Speaker 2>And that's why my parents got together </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of people there probably.</v>

2991
02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:29.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of couples wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>together if they weren't kind of </v>

2992
02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:31.260
<v Speaker 2>culturally forced to be together in </v>
<v Speaker 2>divorce was such a negative thing and it</v>

2993
02:40:31.261 --> 02:40:34.740
<v Speaker 2>grew together and we created a super </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy connection.</v>

2994
02:40:34.750 --> 02:40:39.750
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a little afraid of over </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationality about choosing the path of </v>

2995
02:40:39.750 --> 02:40:44.721
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying like monogamy or not </v>

2996
02:40:44.721 --> 02:40:44.880
<v Speaker 2>monogamy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Relationship don't always make sense.</v>

2997
02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:47.480
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

2998
02:40:47.570 --> 02:40:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm a big believer in doing what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do and if you want to be </v>

2999
02:40:52.570 --> 02:40:56.480
<v Speaker 1>involved in a monogamous relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should do it,</v>

3000
02:40:56.481 --> 02:40:58.130
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't want to be involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

3001
02:40:58.131 --> 02:41:00.070
<v Speaker 1>I think you should do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3002
02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:05.080
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be like a nomad and </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel around the world and just live </v>

3003
02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:08.561
<v Speaker 1>out of a backpack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

3004
02:41:08.561 --> 02:41:10.781
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as you're healthy and you </v>

3005
02:41:10.781 --> 02:41:12.731
<v Speaker 1>survive and you're not depressed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not longing for something that </v>

3006
02:41:12.731 --> 02:41:15.791
<v Speaker 1>you're not participating in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think when you are doing </v>

3007
02:41:15.791 --> 02:41:16.490
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be doing it.</v>

3008
02:41:16.910 --> 02:41:20.360
<v Speaker 1>It brings me back to was it throws </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote.</v>

3009
02:41:20.361 --> 02:41:22.190
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who made this?</v>

3010
02:41:22.580 --> 02:41:27.580
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I know you're most men live </v>

3011
02:41:27.580 --> 02:41:27.680
<v Speaker 1>lives of silent desperation.</v>

3012
02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:30.560
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real man.</v>

3013
02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:32.540
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>

3014
02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:35.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what you don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's thorough,</v>

3015
02:41:35.580 --> 02:41:39.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want silent desperation.</v>

3016
02:41:39.531 --> 02:41:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

3017
02:41:39.970 --> 02:41:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love that quote because I've </v>

3018
02:41:44.970 --> 02:41:47.381
<v Speaker 1>seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it in so many people's faces </v>

3019
02:41:47.381 --> 02:41:49.451
<v Speaker 1>and that's one thing I've managed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid and I dunno if I avoided that by </v>

3020
02:41:49.451 --> 02:41:53.170
<v Speaker 1>luck or just by fact I'm stupid and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

3021
02:41:53.171 --> 02:41:58.171
<v Speaker 1>I just follow my instincts whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're right or wrong or and I make it </v>

3022
02:41:58.171 --> 02:42:02.261
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this goes back to what we were </v>

3023
02:42:02.261 --> 02:42:06.070
<v Speaker 1>discussing when in terms of what is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of reality and what are these,</v>

3024
02:42:06.530 --> 02:42:11.530
<v Speaker 1>are we just finding these romanticized </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretations of our own biological </v>

3025
02:42:14.001 --> 02:42:19.001
<v Speaker 1>needs and our human reward systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's creating these beautiful visions </v>

3026
02:42:19.001 --> 02:42:23.231
<v Speaker 1>of what is life and what is important </v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry and food and music and all the </v>

3027
02:42:23.231 --> 02:42:27.461
<v Speaker 1>passions and dancing and holding someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your arms that you care for deeply </v>

3028
02:42:27.461 --> 02:42:31.661
<v Speaker 1>and all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just little tricks or all those little </v>

3029
02:42:31.661 --> 02:42:35.711
<v Speaker 1>biological tricks in order just to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep on this very strange dance of human</v>

3030
02:42:36.621 --> 02:42:41.621
<v Speaker 1>civilization so that we can keep on </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating new and better products that </v>

3031
02:42:41.621 --> 02:42:46.331
<v Speaker 1>keep on moving innovation towards this </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate eventual goal.</v>

3032
02:42:47.450 --> 02:42:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Artificial intelligence of this giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>birth to the gods.</v>

3033
02:42:51.320 --> 02:42:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Giving birth to the guns.</v>

3034
02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3035
02:42:54.780 --> 02:42:57.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did want to mention one thing about,</v>

3036
02:42:57.040 --> 02:42:59.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one thing I really,</v>

3037
02:42:59.490 --> 02:43:04.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand fully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've been thinking about for the </v>

3038
02:43:04.490 --> 02:43:06.480
<v Speaker 2>last couple of years at the application </v>
<v Speaker 2>of artificial intelligence to,</v>

3039
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:11.710
<v Speaker 2>into politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard you talked about sort of a </v>

3040
02:43:11.740 --> 02:43:13.840
<v Speaker 2>government being broken in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>that one guy,</v>

3041
02:43:14.020 --> 02:43:16.000
<v Speaker 2>one president that doesn't make any </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

3042
02:43:16.810 --> 02:43:18.940
<v Speaker 2>I see you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get like,</v>

3043
02:43:19.470 --> 02:43:23.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get hundreds of millions of likes</v>

3044
02:43:23.981 --> 02:43:28.981
<v Speaker 2>on their facebook pictures and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram and we're always voting with </v>

3045
02:43:28.981 --> 02:43:33.661
<v Speaker 2>our fingers every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet for the election process it </v>

3046
02:43:33.661 --> 02:43:37.651
<v Speaker 2>seems that we're voting like once every </v>
<v Speaker 2>four years it feels like this new </v>

3047
02:43:37.841 --> 02:43:42.841
<v Speaker 2>technology could bring about a world </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the voice of the people can be </v>

3048
02:43:42.841 --> 02:43:47.401
<v Speaker 2>heard on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where you could speak about the </v>

3049
02:43:47.401 --> 02:43:50.580
<v Speaker 2>issues you care about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's gun control and abortion,</v>

3050
02:43:50.770 --> 02:43:51.850
<v Speaker 2>all of these topics that are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3051
02:43:51.851 --> 02:43:56.851
<v Speaker 2>he so debated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like there needs to be an </v>

3052
02:43:56.851 --> 02:43:57.820
<v Speaker 2>instagram for elections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

3053
02:43:58.310 --> 02:44:03.310
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's room for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking about how to write a </v>

3054
02:44:03.310 --> 02:44:04.390
<v Speaker 2>few papers are proposing different </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies.</v>

3055
02:44:04.660 --> 02:44:09.640
<v Speaker 2>It just feels like the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing politics need to our old school</v>

3056
02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:13.800
<v Speaker 1>that is like the influencers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3057
02:44:13.801 --> 02:44:16.080
<v Speaker 1>If you look at Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3058
02:44:16.170 --> 02:44:21.170
<v Speaker 1>should Nicki Minaj be able to decide how</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world works because she's got the </v>

3059
02:44:21.601 --> 02:44:23.740
<v Speaker 1>most followers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should Kim Kardashians,</v>

3060
02:44:23.970 --> 02:44:28.970
<v Speaker 1>like who's influencing things and why </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to deal with the fickle </v>

3061
02:44:28.970 --> 02:44:33.021
<v Speaker 1>nature of human beings and do we give </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough patients towards the decisions of</v>

3062
02:44:35.221 --> 02:44:39.000
<v Speaker 1>these so called leaders that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>electing to adored you just decided fuck</v>

3063
02:44:39.001 --> 02:44:44.001
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're out new person in because we </v>

3064
02:44:44.001 --> 02:44:44.001
<v Speaker 1>have like a really short attention span </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to think,</v>

3065
02:44:44.001 --> 02:44:46.020
<v Speaker 1>especially today with the new cycles so </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick,</v>

3066
02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:51.660
<v Speaker 2>so the same process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the instagram might be a bad example </v>

3067
02:44:51.660 --> 02:44:55.171
<v Speaker 2>because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get or twitter and you start </v>

3068
02:44:55.171 --> 02:44:57.280
<v Speaker 2>following Donald Trump or and you start </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sort of idolize these certain icons </v>

3069
02:44:57.371 --> 02:44:59.470
<v Speaker 2>that do we necessarily want them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent us?</v>

3070
02:45:00.370 --> 02:45:05.370
<v Speaker 2>I was more thinking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Amazon product reviews model </v>

3071
02:45:05.370 --> 02:45:08.170
<v Speaker 2>recommender systems or Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movies.</v>

3072
02:45:08.171 --> 02:45:13.171
<v Speaker 2>You've watched the Netflix learning </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough about you to represent you in </v>

3073
02:45:14.531 --> 02:45:19.531
<v Speaker 2>your next movie selection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the kind of movies like what do </v>

3074
02:45:19.531 --> 02:45:23.791
<v Speaker 2>you like [inaudible] Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the kinds of movies that you </v>

3075
02:45:23.791 --> 02:45:27.631
<v Speaker 2>would like the recommender systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these artificial intelligence systems </v>

3076
02:45:27.631 --> 02:45:31.681
<v Speaker 2>learn based on your netflix election </v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be deeper understanding of </v>

3077
02:45:31.781 --> 02:45:36.100
<v Speaker 2>who you are than you're even aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's that element.</v>

3078
02:45:36.101 --> 02:45:40.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's that element of learning who</v>

3079
02:45:40.031 --> 02:45:45.031
<v Speaker 2>you are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think drugs should be legalized </v>

3080
02:45:45.031 --> 02:45:45.031
<v Speaker 2>or not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3081
02:45:45.031 --> 02:45:48.850
<v Speaker 2>do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think immigration,</v>

3082
02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.490
<v Speaker 2>should we let everybody in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll keep everybody out.</v>

3083
02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Should we all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these topics with a red and blue </v>

3084
02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:01.440
<v Speaker 2>teams now have a hard to answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you keep all the immigrants </v>

3085
02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:03.430
<v Speaker 2>out or of course you need to be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>compassionate of course,</v>

3086
02:46:03.970 --> 02:46:08.970
<v Speaker 2>but for most people is really a gray </v>
<v Speaker 2>area and exploring gray area.</v>

3087
02:46:09.790 --> 02:46:10.070
<v Speaker 2>The way</v>

3088
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:12.590
<v Speaker 3>you would explore the gray area of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix.</v>

3089
02:46:12.591 --> 02:46:17.591
<v Speaker 3>What is the next movie or watching?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to watch the Little Mermaid </v>

3090
02:46:17.591 --> 02:46:18.330
<v Speaker 3>or a godfather?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

3091
02:46:18.640 --> 02:46:21.290
<v Speaker 3>what that process of understanding who </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are.</v>

3092
02:46:21.291 --> 02:46:24.650
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels like that there's room for that</v>

3093
02:46:24.651 --> 02:46:25.300
<v Speaker 3>in our other problem.</v>

3094
02:46:25.330 --> 02:46:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Home is of course that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's grave consequences to these </v>

3095
02:46:30.330 --> 02:46:34.831
<v Speaker 1>decisions that you're going to make in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the way it affects the </v>

3096
02:46:34.831 --> 02:46:37.681
<v Speaker 1>community and you might not have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that you're basing this on </v>

3097
02:46:37.811 --> 02:46:39.830
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be basing all these decisions,</v>

3098
02:46:39.831 --> 02:46:43.960
<v Speaker 1>decisions on misinformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda,</v>

3099
02:46:43.990 --> 02:46:47.980
<v Speaker 1>nonsense advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be easily influenced.</v>

3100
02:46:48.220 --> 02:46:49.870
<v Speaker 1>You might not have looked into it at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

3101
02:46:49.871 --> 02:46:54.871
<v Speaker 1>You can be ignorant about the subject </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it might just appeal to certain </v>

3102
02:46:54.871 --> 02:46:57.760
<v Speaker 1>dynamics that have been programmed into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain because you grew up religious</v>

3103
02:46:57.761 --> 02:47:00.540
<v Speaker 1>or you grew up in an atheist or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

3104
02:47:00.610 --> 02:47:05.610
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are educated about the </v>

3105
02:47:05.610 --> 02:47:07.330
<v Speaker 1>consequences of these decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to see information.</v>

3106
02:47:07.331 --> 02:47:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I think,</v>

3107
02:47:11.060 --> 02:47:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's going to be a time in </v>

3108
02:47:16.060 --> 02:47:20.371
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our life where our ability to access </v>

3109
02:47:20.371 --> 02:47:23.851
<v Speaker 1>information is many steps better than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is now with smartphones.</v>

3110
02:47:25.330 --> 02:47:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going like Elon Musk has </v>
<v Speaker 1>some neuro link thing that he's working </v>

3111
02:47:30.330 --> 02:47:30.780
<v Speaker 1>on right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is being very vague about it.</v>

3112
02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:35.790
<v Speaker 3>Increase the bandwidth of our human </v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction with machines is what he's </v>

3113
02:47:35.790 --> 02:47:35.790
<v Speaker 3>worth.</v>

3114
02:47:35.790 --> 02:47:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

3115
02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm very interested to see where this </v>
<v Speaker 1>leads,</v>

3116
02:47:38.860 --> 02:47:43.270
<v Speaker 1>but I think that we can assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because something like the Internet came</v>

3117
02:47:43.271 --> 02:47:48.100
<v Speaker 1>along and because it's so accessible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I right now with your phone,</v>

3118
02:47:48.101 --> 02:47:49.540
<v Speaker 1>just pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

3119
02:47:49.541 --> 02:47:51.190
<v Speaker 1>hey google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

3120
02:47:51.550 --> 02:47:56.550
<v Speaker 1>And then you get the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the answer almost </v>

3121
02:47:56.550 --> 02:47:58.351
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gonna change what a person is as </v>

3122
02:47:58.691 --> 02:48:03.691
<v Speaker 1>that advances and I think we're much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely looking at some sort of a </v>

3123
02:48:03.691 --> 02:48:07.231
<v Speaker 1>symbiotic connection between us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence and computer </v>

3124
02:48:08.290 --> 02:48:13.290
<v Speaker 1>augmented access to information than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are looking at the rise of some </v>

3125
02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:16.750
<v Speaker 1>artificial being that takes us over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucks are girlfriend.</v>

3126
02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:20.320
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the real existential threat.</v>

3127
02:48:20.860 --> 02:48:22.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

3128
02:48:22.901 --> 02:48:27.901
<v Speaker 3>That's to me is super exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The phone is a portal to this collective</v>

3129
02:48:28.571 --> 02:48:33.571
<v Speaker 3>that we have this collective </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and it gives people a </v>

3130
02:48:33.571 --> 02:48:34.570
<v Speaker 3>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say if anyone's like me,</v>

3131
02:48:35.950 --> 02:48:38.950
<v Speaker 3>you really know very little about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>politicians you're voting for,</v>

3132
02:48:38.951 --> 02:48:43.951
<v Speaker 3>or even the issues like global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm embarrassed to say I like,</v>

3133
02:48:45.100 --> 02:48:50.100
<v Speaker 3>I know very little about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I'm actually being honest with </v>

3134
02:48:50.100 --> 02:48:50.710
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard different,</v>

3135
02:48:51.530 --> 02:48:56.050
<v Speaker 3>like I know what I'm supposed to believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a scientist but actually know nothing</v>

3136
02:48:56.410 --> 02:49:00.630
<v Speaker 3>about concrete and not nothing concrete </v>
<v Speaker 3>about process about the va,</v>

3137
02:49:00.690 --> 02:49:05.690
<v Speaker 3>the environmental process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why is it so certain scientists </v>

3138
02:49:05.690 --> 02:49:08.040
<v Speaker 3>apparently completely agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as a scientist,</v>

3139
02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:13.040
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kinda take on faith oftentimes what </v>

3140
02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:14.040
<v Speaker 4>the community agrees in my own </v>
<v Speaker 4>discipline I question,</v>

3141
02:49:14.070 --> 02:49:19.070
<v Speaker 4>but outside I just kind of take on faith</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the same thing with a gun control </v>

3142
02:49:19.381 --> 02:49:24.381
<v Speaker 4>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just kind of say which team of my </v>

3143
02:49:24.381 --> 02:49:24.381
<v Speaker 4>own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm just going to take that on.</v>

3144
02:49:24.381 --> 02:49:28.310
<v Speaker 4>I just feel like it's such a disruptive </v>
<v Speaker 4>space to where people could be given </v>

3145
02:49:28.471 --> 02:49:31.080
<v Speaker 4>just a tiny bit more information to help</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

3146
02:49:31.260 --> 02:49:33.390
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe that's where something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>neuro link comes along.</v>

3147
02:49:33.410 --> 02:49:38.410
<v Speaker 4>It just enhances our ability to access </v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff in a way that's much more </v>

3148
02:49:38.550 --> 02:49:43.050
<v Speaker 4>just more tangible than just being able </v>
<v Speaker 4>to google search it and maybe this,</v>

3149
02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:45.480
<v Speaker 4>this process is something that we really</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't anticipate.</v>

3150
02:49:45.490 --> 02:49:48.390
<v Speaker 4>It's going to have to happen to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like what we're talking about,</v>

3151
02:49:48.391 --> 02:49:53.391
<v Speaker 4>cell phone images that you could just </v>
<v Speaker 4>send to Australia with the click of a </v>

3152
02:49:53.391 --> 02:49:55.290
<v Speaker 4>button that no one would have ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>anticipated that 300 years ago.</v>

3153
02:49:55.440 --> 02:50:00.440
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we are beyond our.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our capacity for understanding the </v>

3154
02:50:01.591 --> 02:50:04.500
<v Speaker 4>impact of all of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe kids coming up now.</v>

3155
02:50:04.860 --> 02:50:09.030
<v Speaker 4>What is that world going to look like </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're too old to be sitting?</v>

3156
02:50:09.031 --> 02:50:14.031
<v Speaker 4>You'll be like 95 sitting on a porch </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a shotgun cleaning swing and what </v>

3157
02:50:14.031 --> 02:50:16.110
<v Speaker 4>do those kids look like when they're 18 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years old?</v>

3158
02:50:16.140 --> 02:50:20.850
<v Speaker 4>Robots fucking x Ray vision and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>could read minds.</v>

3159
02:50:20.851 --> 02:50:22.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well yoga is going to happen.</v>

3160
02:50:22.510 --> 02:50:25.260
<v Speaker 4>They'd be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>robots are everywhere these days.</v>

3161
02:50:25.261 --> 02:50:28.620
<v Speaker 4>Back back in my day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we used to put robots in their place.</v>

3162
02:50:29.920 --> 02:50:34.410
<v Speaker 4>They were serving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shut them off and now fuck your mom.</v>

3163
02:50:35.590 --> 02:50:37.530
<v Speaker 4>Now they want to go to the same school </v>
<v Speaker 4>as us.</v>

3164
02:50:38.070 --> 02:50:39.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they want to.</v>

3165
02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:41.110
<v Speaker 4>They want to run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3166
02:50:42.170 --> 02:50:43.650
<v Speaker 4>they want to run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3167
02:50:43.651 --> 02:50:48.651
<v Speaker 4>They're more compassionate and smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we still hate them because they </v>

3168
02:50:48.651 --> 02:50:48.651
<v Speaker 4>don't go to the bathroom.</v>

3169
02:50:48.651 --> 02:50:50.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well now we half the country,</v>

3170
02:50:50.041 --> 02:50:55.041
<v Speaker 4>look at them and the other love them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Abraham Lincoln character will come </v>

3171
02:50:55.041 --> 02:50:56.020
<v Speaker 4>along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm pitching myself.</v>

3172
02:50:56.770 --> 02:51:01.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you Lincoln of the robot world of the </v>

3173
02:51:01.770 --> 02:51:04.130
<v Speaker 4>robot world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the speeches that everybody </v>

3174
02:51:04.130 --> 02:51:07.401
<v Speaker 4>quotes in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One other thing I got to say about </v>

3175
02:51:07.401 --> 02:51:07.401
<v Speaker 4>academia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

3176
02:51:08.280 --> 02:51:13.280
<v Speaker 4>In defense of academia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you've had a lot of really smart </v>

3177
02:51:13.280 --> 02:51:15.330
<v Speaker 4>people on including Sam Harris and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jordan Peterson.</v>

3178
02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:19.920
<v Speaker 4>And often the word academia is used to </v>
<v Speaker 4>replace a certain concept.</v>

3179
02:51:20.520 --> 02:51:25.520
<v Speaker 4>So I'm part of academia and most of </v>
<v Speaker 4>academia is engineering is biology,</v>
