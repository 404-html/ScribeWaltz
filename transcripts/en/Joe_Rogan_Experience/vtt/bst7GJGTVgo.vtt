<v Speaker 2>all the shows are on audible,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's the coolest thing ever said.</v>

66
00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:54.840
<v Speaker 2>Like if you missed yesterday's show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just go online and download the show</v>

67
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.050
<v Speaker 2>and I think they touched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took all the best parts of a Jimmy on </v>

68
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.050
<v Speaker 2>opie and anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is volume two.</v>

69
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 2>So there's a few of them and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says an hour and 10 minutes.</v>

70
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.640
<v Speaker 3>And you said one of your books is </v>
<v Speaker 3>available,</v>

71
00:03:04.641 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

72
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 3>Happy ending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I did the voice read for an audio </v>

73
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do it for,</v>

74
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.360
<v Speaker 3>I hate your guts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come you didn't do no time?</v>

75
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.590
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had,</v>

76
00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:18.230
<v Speaker 3>but because when I did the happy endings</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

77
00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 3>it was such an annoying process to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through because they like,</v>

78
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.420
<v Speaker 3>she's like say it like this and say it </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

79
00:03:23.421 --> 00:03:25.250
<v Speaker 3>And I listened to her but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a comic.</v>

80
00:03:25.251 --> 00:03:30.251
<v Speaker 3>I know how to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should have just done when she's </v>

81
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:30.251
<v Speaker 3>telling you how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to read it.</v>

82
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.060
<v Speaker 3>So it's clear like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they do that with everybody,</v>

83
00:03:32.061 --> 00:03:34.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's like I should have overrode or </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a fuel it.</v>

84
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.020
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know how to do that.</v>

85
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have that kind of impact.</v>

86
00:03:38.241 --> 00:03:39.890
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to put out a bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>product.</v>

87
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.070
<v Speaker 3>I know you when you're trying to do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best thing that you can do it.</v>

88
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people were trying to change your </v>

89
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 3>annunciations or micromanage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

90
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.340
<v Speaker 3>That becomes a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

91
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 3>I had a book deal and I gave back the </v>
<v Speaker 3>money because of that video.</v>

92
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to deal with it.</v>

93
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were trying to get me to write it </v>

94
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.881
<v Speaker 3>like a stand up and stand up for him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we kind of had such a gap between what </v>

95
00:04:01.881 --> 00:04:04.730
<v Speaker 3>they wanted and what I wanted to do was </v>
<v Speaker 3>so wide that I was like,</v>

96
00:04:04.731 --> 00:04:08.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's fair because I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't make your book what dummies they</v>

97
00:04:08.601 --> 00:04:09.350
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

98
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.780
<v Speaker 3>they have an idea of what they think </v>
<v Speaker 3>could sell.</v>

99
00:04:11.781 --> 00:04:15.980
<v Speaker 3>They actually wanted me to try to do my </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup in book form and I was like,</v>

100
00:04:15.981 --> 00:04:16.940
<v Speaker 3>there's no way I would do that.</v>

101
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 3>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but George Carlin did it and Jerry </v>

102
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Seinfeld did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

103
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 3>that's great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and those guys are great comics.</v>

104
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.940
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

105
00:04:22.941 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna.</v>

106
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.070
<v Speaker 3>Do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to do that.</v>

107
00:04:25.071 --> 00:04:26.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to put my fucking stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand,</v>

108
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.130
<v Speaker 3>stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up for a reason.</v>

109
00:04:28.131 --> 00:04:30.230
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be that way and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheating in a way.</v>

110
00:04:30.231 --> 00:04:32.210
<v Speaker 3>It's just cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of coming up with a new book.</v>

111
00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:37.211
<v Speaker 3>You just taking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's lazy thinking by publishers are </v>

112
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:37.211
<v Speaker 3>copy editors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it was just gross.</v>

113
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:42.131
<v Speaker 3>I think they just trying to make money </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it led me think that they were just </v>

114
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:45.311
<v Speaker 3>trying to make the most money possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't really worried about it </v>

115
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:45.311
<v Speaker 3>being good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you would never propose that.</v>

116
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.470
<v Speaker 3>So it was just,</v>

<v Speaker 3>thing to talk about.</v>

<v Speaker 3>air and I said that it's going on my </v>

<v Speaker 3>Good to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good to see you.</v>

221
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:42.630

<v Speaker 3>I'm drinking this coffee and it's very </v>

222
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.601
<v Speaker 3>good with the butter in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know that I'm going to be any of </v>

223
00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:47.820
<v Speaker 3>that stuff like lactose just fucks me up</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I know him a lot.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>

225
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.560
<v Speaker 3>I'll be interested to see if it has the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same effect on you because it's grass </v>

226
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:53.560
<v Speaker 3>fed butter.</v>

227
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.970
<v Speaker 3>Wonder if that has the same effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I find,</v>

228
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.770
<v Speaker 3>I find that I could be lactose </v>
<v Speaker 3>intolerant,</v>

229
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.340
<v Speaker 3>but when I drink raw milk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any problem which the grass</v>

230
00:10:00.341 --> 00:10:03.040
<v Speaker 3>fed butter effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the idea is,</v>

231
00:10:03.041 --> 00:10:05.410
<v Speaker 3>and obviously I'm no doctor so don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to me,</v>

232
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:10.650
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is that butter from grass </v>
<v Speaker 3>fed cows is butter from healthier cows </v>

233
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.750
<v Speaker 3>and cows are not designed to eat corn </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when they eat corn it's one of the </v>

234
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.400
<v Speaker 3>reasons why they get so fucking fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

235
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.310
<v Speaker 3>It's just not a part of their normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>

236
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.290
<v Speaker 3>their normal diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just grass.</v>

237
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:25.620
<v Speaker 3>And when you have grass fed beef it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>much leaner beef tastes different and </v>

238
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.091
<v Speaker 3>the idea is the butters different too </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the butter is actually healthy for </v>

239
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:30.820
<v Speaker 3>you as opposed to the butter that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting.</v>

240
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.620
<v Speaker 3>That's from corn fed cows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is the homogenization </v>

241
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.870
<v Speaker 3>and pasteurization of milk changes so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much about how your body absorbs it,</v>

242
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.080
<v Speaker 3>like the enzymes in it and everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>you ever had.</v>

243
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.340
<v Speaker 3>Like raw milk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

244
00:10:46.341 --> 00:10:51.341
<v Speaker 3>I don't love milk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drink it out of necessity and other </v>

245
00:10:51.341 --> 00:10:51.341
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

246
00:10:51.341 --> 00:10:54.581
<v Speaker 3>I can never be the professional just </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking around lugging milk at how bad </v>

247
00:10:54.581 --> 00:10:56.390
<v Speaker 3>his breath must be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drink fucking milk.</v>

248
00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.660
<v Speaker 3>That was supposed to be like the sign </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're a serious man.</v>

249
00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:02.540
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Hustler a give me with Paul Newman?</v>

250
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:03.080
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

251
00:11:03.081 --> 00:11:08.081
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember the Jackie gleason's </v>

252
00:11:08.081 --> 00:11:08.150
<v Speaker 3>backer was George C dot Scott and George</v>
<v Speaker 3>C dot Scott.</v>

253
00:11:08.151 --> 00:11:12.080
<v Speaker 3>Played Burt and Bert Gordon and he drank</v>
<v Speaker 3>a glass of milk everywhere.</v>

254
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:17.380
<v Speaker 3>Everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's getting fucked up left and </v>

255
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:17.480
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all drinking whiskey and they're</v>

256
00:11:17.481 --> 00:11:20.960
<v Speaker 3>all fucking bar just over there drinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>a glass of milk.</v>

257
00:11:20.961 --> 00:11:23.600
<v Speaker 3>He's serious as serious gambler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

258
00:11:23.601 --> 00:11:24.590
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never saw that.</v>

259
00:11:24.591 --> 00:11:26.510
<v Speaker 3>I remember the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember that part of it.</v>

260
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.600
<v Speaker 3>I guess it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say 63.</v>

261
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it was 1963.</v>

262
00:11:31.281 --> 00:11:33.200
<v Speaker 3>That's a great fucking movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Guy,</v>

263
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.060
<v Speaker 3>the guy fat changed his name because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

264
00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:36.470
<v Speaker 3>Minnesota statues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gleason.</v>

265
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:40.310
<v Speaker 3>What was the real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the original fashion wander.</v>

266
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Own Rudolph Rudolph wander own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's his real name.</v>

267
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's Rudolph wander own.</v>

268
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

269
00:11:47.511 --> 00:11:52.511
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was not even the best pool player of </v>

270
00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:52.940
<v Speaker 3>his era,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even close Moscone was,</v>

271
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:57.990
<v Speaker 3>and they used to have these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these matches and Moscow and he hated </v>

272
00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.550
<v Speaker 3>the fact that people only knew him </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he played Minnesota fats because</v>

273
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:02.640
<v Speaker 3>Minnesota fats stole the name off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

274
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.280
<v Speaker 3>It was a brilliant move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that was based on me.</v>

275
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.160
<v Speaker 3>He was a really eccentric character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Minnesota fats.</v>

276
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:10.540
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a bad pool player.</v>

277
00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 3>He was a really good pool player,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was a hustler.</v>

278
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

279
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.060
<v Speaker 3>he had like 100 cats.</v>

280
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:21.180
<v Speaker 3>He was one of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he used to go to Kentucky Fried Chicken </v>

281
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.540
<v Speaker 3>and he picked up like two buckets of </v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken and he would just tossed them in</v>

282
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:26.470
<v Speaker 3>his yard and like 100 cats would come in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and tear the chicken apart.</v>

283
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what he did every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was his thing.</v>

284
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like a gang of stray animals that he</v>

285
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 3>fed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was an interesting guy,</v>

286
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The character wasn't based on on him,</v>

287
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:42.990
<v Speaker 3>the character in most likely it was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>a base and a bunch of different pool </v>

288
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.340
<v Speaker 3>players.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's fiction added to it?</v>

289
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.130
<v Speaker 3>My priest years ago when I was in North </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brunswick,</v>

290
00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 3>his name is father miserables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's dead now,</v>

291
00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:51.690
<v Speaker 3>but his brother was a very famous steve </v>
<v Speaker 3>miserable,</v>

292
00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:52.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

293
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was showing off for his cousin </v>

294
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:57.220
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't remember what it was.</v>

295
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:02.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the guy that did those </v>

296
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:02.190
<v Speaker 3>commercials on Miller lite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

297
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:02.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

298
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every now and then a guy like sneaks </v>

299
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.310
<v Speaker 3>through and becomes famous through a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sport where no one else is famous.</v>

300
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.260
<v Speaker 3>Like in pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody says,</v>

301
00:13:08.261 --> 00:13:10.300
<v Speaker 3>Jeanette Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you and do you know who he is?</v>

302
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:11.950
<v Speaker 3>Now if you tell someone that you play </v>
<v Speaker 3>pool,</v>

303
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:13.210
<v Speaker 3>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know who genetically is?</v>

304
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.450
<v Speaker 3>She's this really beautiful woman who </v>
<v Speaker 3>was also.</v>

305
00:13:16.451 --> 00:13:18.880
<v Speaker 3>She was a pool champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't play,</v>

306
00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:23.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't think as much anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was on espn a lot.</v>

307
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.210
<v Speaker 3>She might be back into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

308
00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:30.211
<v Speaker 3>but she's beautiful and she plays really</v>
<v Speaker 3>pool and she wears all black and her </v>

309
00:13:30.211 --> 00:13:33.220
<v Speaker 3>nickname is the black widow and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>Korean so she's got this dark black hair</v>

310
00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:35.570
<v Speaker 3>and she's pretty and so people go nuts </v>
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

311
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.620
<v Speaker 3>So she's like the Lance Armstrong and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't mean this about performance </v>

312
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.040
<v Speaker 3>enhancement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean by Lance Armstrong cancer,</v>

313
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.750
<v Speaker 3>either one with Lance Armstrong is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>only bike guy I've ever heard of.</v>

314
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.530
<v Speaker 3>Like I guess Greg Lamont,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

315
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.980
<v Speaker 3>he was one that I had heard of like way </v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the past.</v>

316
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.620
<v Speaker 3>But as far as like being able to name </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional cycles,</v>

317
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.660
<v Speaker 3>I can after Lance Armstrong and no one </v>
<v Speaker 3>cares about any of them.</v>

318
00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.250
<v Speaker 3>If you talk about like professional pool</v>
<v Speaker 3>players almost everybody goes,</v>

319
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.540
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about the black widow?</v>

320
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Like that woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I seen her but I don't know.</v>

321
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.350
<v Speaker 3>I bet you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's in,</v>

322
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.150
<v Speaker 3>she's in commercials too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure she just,</v>

323
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:12.170
<v Speaker 3>she does a lot like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she's been the most successful at </v>

324
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.210
<v Speaker 3>utilizing her image and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and becoming famous and a sport where </v>

325
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.770
<v Speaker 3>almost no one's famous like it's for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Popeyes is tough time.</v>

326
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.230
<v Speaker 3>There's no this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very hard to make a living.</v>

327
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:25.270
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to become famous and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a hard to express the </v>

328
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.980
<v Speaker 3>personality there or something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>differentiates you and makes you likable</v>

329
00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:28.750
<v Speaker 3>that Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is bigger than the sport.</v>

330
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe she has that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's some hot dude.</v>

331
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.470
<v Speaker 3>She's hot and she plays pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is,</v>

332
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.470
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's very savvy as far as marketing</v>

333
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.710
<v Speaker 3>rather wide backed girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big girl with her.</v>

334
00:14:41.711 --> 00:14:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Ellen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that celebrity poker thing.</v>

335
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get actually get to play with </v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

336
00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

337
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.430
<v Speaker 3>I've played in a tournament and she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the commentator,</v>

338
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.410
<v Speaker 3>which was kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's commentating on me playing pool,</v>

339
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>world class professional.</v>

340
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 3>But luckily I was playing against people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't have any idea what they were</v>

341
00:14:57.111 --> 00:14:59.000
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked pool and hated.</v>

342
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:03.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't find it relaxing at all to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I stink at it and I suck at long</v>

343
00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 3>green shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

344
00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:05.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

345
00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:10.451
<v Speaker 3>I'm fairly hideous at Paul and I never </v>
<v Speaker 3>found it enjoyable because I just can't </v>

346
00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:10.451
<v Speaker 3>get the hang of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tools,</v>

347
00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:14.800
<v Speaker 3>one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets enjoyable when you get really </v>

348
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:14.800
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

349
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.620
<v Speaker 3>As you get really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it becomes like really satisfying </v>

350
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.370
<v Speaker 3>if you can get into a groove and run out</v>
<v Speaker 3>racks and you get in good position.</v>

351
00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.610
<v Speaker 3>So satisfying that cocky walk around the</v>
<v Speaker 3>table and I've never taken.</v>

352
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:28.030
<v Speaker 3>I just fucking shamefully go from point </v>
<v Speaker 3>a to point B and hope I don't scratch </v>

353
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.030
<v Speaker 3>like a cunt.</v>

354
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.640
<v Speaker 3>The worst is playing in a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

355
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.640
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of people crowded around a table</v>
<v Speaker 3>and drinking and bumping into shit.</v>

356
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:42.641
<v Speaker 3>And it's what a ridiculous idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>precision game in a bar with a bunch of </v>

357
00:15:43.371 --> 00:15:45.890
<v Speaker 3>drunks stumbling into tables and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>darts.</v>

358
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:50.891
<v Speaker 3>There's another fucking genius idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's take a bunch of people that are </v>

359
00:15:50.891 --> 00:15:53.480
<v Speaker 3>hammered and give him pointed metal </v>
<v Speaker 3>things to throw at each other.</v>

360
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't cross the line.</v>

361
00:15:54.891 --> 00:15:59.891
<v Speaker 3>It really is a darling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing worse than a dart </v>

362
00:15:59.891 --> 00:15:59.891
<v Speaker 3>league.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially.</v>

363
00:15:59.891 --> 00:16:02.880
<v Speaker 3>They fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll fight over a guy's fucking foot </v>

364
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:02.900
<v Speaker 3>crossing the line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll actually go to blows.</v>

365
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't find it enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played dark.</v>

366
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.860
<v Speaker 3>Even if I got them all on the red button</v>
<v Speaker 3>and be like,</v>

367
00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:08.570
<v Speaker 3>who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrible.</v>

368
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:13.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't enjoy darts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think if you've tried to pick a </v>

369
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:13.810
<v Speaker 3>fight with a dark guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did they draw on each other?</v>

370
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:18.400
<v Speaker 3>They pull their darts out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take three paces or whatever and throw </v>

371
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.180
<v Speaker 3>them at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at in a fight a nine to five.</v>

372
00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:25.181
<v Speaker 3>I was at a bar that there was a fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>and somebody took a datsun and stabbed </v>

373
00:16:25.181 --> 00:16:25.181
<v Speaker 3>the guy in the back.</v>

374
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:27.950
<v Speaker 3>They probably never fight each other for</v>
<v Speaker 3>that reason.</v>

375
00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:30.450
<v Speaker 3>They're all holding darts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a fucking really.</v>

376
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.750
<v Speaker 3>The store in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's got a gun.</v>

377
00:16:32.751 --> 00:16:34.340
<v Speaker 3>You don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

378
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.320
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

379
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:41.830
<v Speaker 3>You never hear about to dark players </v>
<v Speaker 3>going out and throwing darts at each </v>

380
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:41.830
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

381
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.610
<v Speaker 3>Like they're really experts at tossing </v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons.</v>

382
00:16:43.611 --> 00:16:44.900
<v Speaker 3>We had darts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking weapon.</v>

383
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.760
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it was poison,</v>

384
00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:51.770
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are you going to stop a dirt from a </v>

385
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.491
<v Speaker 3>dark expert guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was the only thing is they take their </v>

386
00:16:54.491 --> 00:16:54.491
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those fucks,</v>

387
00:16:54.491 --> 00:16:58.121
<v Speaker 3>don't you hate when they line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate when they got their foot there </v>

388
00:16:58.121 --> 00:16:58.121
<v Speaker 3>and they got the eye thing and the arms </v>
<v Speaker 3>going back and forth and you're like,</v>

389
00:16:58.121 --> 00:16:59.540
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just fucking kill yourself.</v>

390
00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:04.690
<v Speaker 3>What is the stupid fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you really stop and think about it,</v>

391
00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:06.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's fun to play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong,</v>

392
00:17:06.141 --> 00:17:11.141
<v Speaker 3>but what a stupid skill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So throw something and make it stick </v>

393
00:17:11.141 --> 00:17:11.990
<v Speaker 3>into a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something spot.</v>

394
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.500
<v Speaker 3>Something that counted years ago we </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunted for food or like on game of </v>

395
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.521
<v Speaker 3>thrones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great skill to have to be able </v>

396
00:17:21.521 --> 00:17:21.521
<v Speaker 3>to shoot something accurately at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>target,</v>

397
00:17:21.521 --> 00:17:22.820
<v Speaker 3>but now it just doesn't mean anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

398
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:28.330
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going like squirrel hunting with </v>

399
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:28.330
<v Speaker 3>a bow and arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

400
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:29.490
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a really good aim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

401
00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.400
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing something like that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>a dark.</v>

402
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Could you go like bird hunting with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dark loosening up to these </v>

403
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:36.910
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

404
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.090
<v Speaker 3>Low dark would see he'd blow Darwin </v>
<v Speaker 3>where.</v>

405
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:43.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched the special with these dudes </v>

406
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:43.100
<v Speaker 3>were Jack and monkeys with blow darts.</v>

407
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:47.790
<v Speaker 3>It was really crazy to watch man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watching people kill monkeys is very </v>

408
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.260
<v Speaker 3>strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's so.</v>

409
00:17:49.261 --> 00:17:52.530
<v Speaker 3>It feels so close to murder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

410
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

411
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.750
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a monkey.</v>

412
00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:59.751

<v Speaker 3>Like those things are really close to </v>

<v Speaker 3>name of the poison.</v>

437
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:07.220
<v Speaker 3>He drinks beer every night and he gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this water and swims for days and he </v>

438
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.180
<v Speaker 3>doesn't even look like he's in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest shape in the world,</v>

439
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:14.270
<v Speaker 3>but the guy just can go and go and go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's ingesting all this fucking </v>

<v Speaker 3>water and like this parasite written </v>
<v Speaker 3>place and he gets all fucked up from it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>what he did was pretty fucking </v>

445
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.391
<v Speaker 3>incredible because he was just like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>regular guy who drank beer who decided </v>

446
00:19:32.391 --> 00:19:32.391
<v Speaker 3>to make this happen.</v>

447
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.770
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

448
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would look,</v>

449
00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:39.530
<v Speaker 3>he didn't like you see the way he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>built his building.</v>

450
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a sturdy looking fella,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's just not built like a guy who's</v>

451
00:19:43.051 --> 00:19:46.290
<v Speaker 3>going to swim the fucking lengthen the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazon a couple of years ago.</v>

452
00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:48.600
<v Speaker 3>So I can't remember all the details </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

453
00:19:48.601 --> 00:19:51.780
<v Speaker 3>but I remember thinking like what a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy character this guy is.</v>

454
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:56.870
<v Speaker 3>He's been like a fire in the twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would have had to have had that </v>

455
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:57.030
<v Speaker 3>barrel chest that you knew that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would fucking problems,</v>

456
00:19:57.031 --> 00:19:58.980
<v Speaker 3>but they weren't ripped and cut guys are</v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

457
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a lot of guys today that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are like that.</v>

458
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking guy like Mike Russell,</v>

459
00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.680
<v Speaker 3>he's a world class heavyweight in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC.</v>

460
00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.680
<v Speaker 3>He's knocked out todd Duffy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a big fucking guy,</v>

461
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.620
<v Speaker 3>so Chicago cop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's built like that,</v>

462
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's built like a regular guy.</v>

463
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:17.340
<v Speaker 3>Some people just have a higher level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat is just genetically.</v>

464
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:20.160
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing you can do about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dude who wants to be punched in the face</v>

465
00:20:20.161 --> 00:20:24.510
<v Speaker 3>by a Chicago cop fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pleasant.</v>

466
00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.900
<v Speaker 3>He's a nice guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all are that.</v>

467
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.770
<v Speaker 3>The guys are the nicest athletes I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>met.</v>

468
00:20:28.771 --> 00:20:33.771
<v Speaker 3>That's why I love it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every one of them has been a cool guy </v>

469
00:20:33.771 --> 00:20:36.420
<v Speaker 3>that I've met and interviewed and never </v>
<v Speaker 3>had they been next to us.</v>

470
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a much healthier attitude.</v>

471
00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:40.380
<v Speaker 3>I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the accolades,</v>

472
00:20:40.381 --> 00:20:45.381
<v Speaker 3>and this is not hating on anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think the accolades that a </v>

473
00:20:45.381 --> 00:20:47.260
<v Speaker 3>professional athlete gets almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>unhealthy sometimes.</v>

474
00:20:47.261 --> 00:20:47.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

475
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.600
<v Speaker 1>and I think that they're not getting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>humiliation that fighters get by losing,</v>

476
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 1>by training in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

477
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.700
<v Speaker 1>by getting broken in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by getting submitted,</v>

478
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.820
<v Speaker 1>by getting tagged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like a certain level of reality </v>

479
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.121
<v Speaker 1>that fighters live in where they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to engage on this chest </v>

480
00:21:06.121 --> 00:21:10.651
<v Speaker 1>puffing that you see a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing almost a compensated because it's </v>

481
00:21:10.651 --> 00:21:14.641
<v Speaker 1>almost like they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't even believe that through </v>

482
00:21:14.641 --> 00:21:17.111
<v Speaker 1>this fucking superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of their brain is like </v>

483
00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:19.771
<v Speaker 1>sabotaging a course in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>causing them to act like cons and not </v>

484
00:21:19.771 --> 00:21:23.370
<v Speaker 1>tip anywhere and slammed doors on people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the kind of shit in here from like </v>

485
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.170
<v Speaker 1>really arrogant pro athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with MMA fighters for the most part,</v>

486
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.470
<v Speaker 1>these are dudes that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're serious about that sport,</v>

487
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.100
<v Speaker 1>you have to have like a spartan </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline.</v>

488
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be the type of person that's</v>

489
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:39.961
<v Speaker 1>watching your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making sure you're organizing your </v>

490
00:21:39.961 --> 00:21:42.871
<v Speaker 1>training and you just get humiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get humiliated and humbled is a </v>

491
00:21:42.871 --> 00:21:47.251
<v Speaker 1>better word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get humbled by the whole process of </v>

492
00:21:47.251 --> 00:21:49.340
<v Speaker 1>trying to become great and of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>different athletes know,</v>

493
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:54.410
<v Speaker 1>you see like some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some pro basketball players that are </v>

494
00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:54.410
<v Speaker 1>like super arrogant or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or crazy.</v>

495
00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:59.281
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't see nearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always gonna see it a certain </v>

496
00:21:59.281 --> 00:22:02.941
<v Speaker 1>amount and the population of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't see nearly as much in mma </v>

497
00:22:02.941 --> 00:22:03.850
<v Speaker 1>or in the UFC as you would think.</v>

498
00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.880
<v Speaker 4>I haven't met that many NBA people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked.</v>

499
00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.970
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be honest,</v>

500
00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.980
<v Speaker 4>the one I thought was really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clyde frazier we had on it was great.</v>

501
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.300
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr Jay was really nice,</v>

502
00:22:15.301 --> 00:22:16.970
<v Speaker 4>but I think he's lost a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

503
00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:22.340
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but fucking I met Lebron James wants </v>

504
00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.190
<v Speaker 4>briefly and he wasn't awful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I only got a photo with them.</v>

505
00:22:25.191 --> 00:22:25.610
<v Speaker 4>This is what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

506
00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:26.000
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

507
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:31.210
<v Speaker 4>this is fairly humiliating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted a picture with him at the </v>

508
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.821
<v Speaker 4>comedy cellar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I texted Kevin Hart because they're </v>

509
00:22:33.821 --> 00:22:33.821
<v Speaker 4>good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

510
00:22:33.821 --> 00:22:34.580
<v Speaker 4>I want to get a picture with Lebron.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he texted Lebron,</v>

511
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:36.120
<v Speaker 4>took my friend's going to be asking you </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a picture.</v>

512
00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:39.200
<v Speaker 4>So that's the only reason he stopped was</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I texted Kevin Hart.</v>

513
00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.610
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's a good deal though.</v>

514
00:22:40.611 --> 00:22:41.860
<v Speaker 4>That's a good connection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

515
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:46.861
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To text my friend who does movies and </v>

516
00:22:46.861 --> 00:22:46.861
<v Speaker 4>see what he can get me a picture of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking NBA player.</v>

517
00:22:46.861 --> 00:22:51.310
<v Speaker 4>Bad favor to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't know you like in pictures </v>

518
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.431
<v Speaker 4>with celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have like more pictures with </v>

519
00:22:54.431 --> 00:22:54.431
<v Speaker 4>celebrities in any other celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do have a lot of them.</v>

520
00:22:54.431 --> 00:22:54.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm glad I do it.</v>

521
00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:55.460
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

522
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.280
<v Speaker 4>it's fun to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although the ones I wished I had,</v>

523
00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.550
<v Speaker 4>I got autographs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I met kinison wants and didn't get a</v>

524
00:23:01.551 --> 00:23:03.710
<v Speaker 4>photo and prior I met once and didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>get a photo,</v>

525
00:23:03.711 --> 00:23:05.870
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't do photos back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

526
00:23:05.871 --> 00:23:07.760
<v Speaker 4>there's a few people that I wish that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd taken.</v>

527
00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.650
<v Speaker 4>I wish I'd taken a photo with Hicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that would have been crying.</v>

528
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:13.610
<v Speaker 4>I never got to meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was more like a high,</v>

529
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never,</v>

530
00:23:14.601 --> 00:23:17.270
<v Speaker 4>I never got to talk to her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I got to see him perform a couple of</v>

531
00:23:17.271 --> 00:23:20.130
<v Speaker 4>times when I was an open mic or fa.</v>

532
00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:23.660
<v Speaker 4>If cameras were around back then back </v>
<v Speaker 4>then it was like really rare.</v>

533
00:23:23.661 --> 00:23:26.960
<v Speaker 4>You had a camera on you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if cameras around like back then.</v>

534
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.600
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a great picture that be.</v>

535
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never met pillocks.</v>

536
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.460
<v Speaker 4>No ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never listened to her stuff.</v>

537
00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.780
<v Speaker 4>Like I've heard cliffs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we played.</v>

538
00:23:32.781 --> 00:23:37.781
<v Speaker 4>I know and a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never listened to a hick cd and </v>

539
00:23:37.781 --> 00:23:38.000
<v Speaker 4>everyone tells me how great he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like at this point in my life,</v>

540
00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:40.320
<v Speaker 4>I just don't want to hear another </v>
<v Speaker 4>comment can be influenced by him.</v>

541
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:42.650
<v Speaker 4>Like just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hear he's great and good.</v>

542
00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:43.940
<v Speaker 4>Good for him and I don't want to know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

543
00:23:43.941 --> 00:23:44.760
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

544
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had this</v>

545
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.710
<v Speaker 3>conversation before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a different opinion on,</v>

546
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.750
<v Speaker 3>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear Ya.</v>

547
00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.150
<v Speaker 3>That can can happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I got it.</v>

548
00:23:53.151 --> 00:23:58.151
<v Speaker 3>I like getting inspired and I think for </v>
<v Speaker 3>me the best way to get inspired is by </v>

549
00:23:58.151 --> 00:23:59.270
<v Speaker 3>just listening to comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

550
00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:00.440
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get inspired.</v>

551
00:24:00.441 --> 00:24:02.530
<v Speaker 3>It makes me want to write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

552
00:24:02.531 --> 00:24:07.531
<v Speaker 3>and I think I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like there's any sense in </v>

553
00:24:07.531 --> 00:24:10.460
<v Speaker 3>avoiding a certain amount of influence </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're going to give each other,</v>

554
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:14.180
<v Speaker 3>but I also think if your mind is </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight and your,</v>

555
00:24:14.181 --> 00:24:16.610
<v Speaker 3>you're good ethics as far as like your </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing,</v>

556
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you really have to worry </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>

557
00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.490
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing.</v>

558
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.520
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to pursue your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not trying to pursue somebody </v>

559
00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.030
<v Speaker 3>else's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a good thing to worry about</v>

560
00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:28.680
<v Speaker 3>when you first starting out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think a year years stop.</v>

561
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:30.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

562
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.950
<v Speaker 3>You're very ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

563
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.500
<v Speaker 3>and I respect your take on this opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the reason why you're doing it.</v>

564
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.750
<v Speaker 3>You're doing it for the exact right </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>

565
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.390
<v Speaker 3>I just always feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

566
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:45.580
<v Speaker 3>I got into comedy because I love the art</v>
<v Speaker 3>form itself and I'm a fan of it and I </v>

567
00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.530
<v Speaker 3>don't want to not be a fan of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

568
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:49.910
<v Speaker 3>just because I'm doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean I want to still enjoy it</v>

569
00:24:49.911 --> 00:24:52.550
<v Speaker 3>as if I had nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was never involved,</v>

570
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:58.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I went on it became a comic book </v>

571
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.071
<v Speaker 3>artist or whatever else I wanted to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>or it could have been if I wasn't a </v>

572
00:25:00.071 --> 00:25:04.001
<v Speaker 3>comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to think that I would like </v>

573
00:25:04.001 --> 00:25:04.001
<v Speaker 3>comedy just as much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

574
00:25:04.001 --> 00:25:04.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny.</v>

575
00:25:04.001 --> 00:25:05.810
<v Speaker 3>I see like I went into a collins one man</v>
<v Speaker 3>show about the constitution.</v>

576
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.070
<v Speaker 3>How was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard a great thing.</v>

577
00:25:07.071 --> 00:25:09.530
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Colin Quinn and where is it?</v>

578
00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.320
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's in New York,</v>

579
00:25:11.321 --> 00:25:13.840
<v Speaker 5>but I think he's moving theaters like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Cherry Lane theater,</v>

580
00:25:13.841 --> 00:25:18.040
<v Speaker 5>but he might be moving and it's a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's better than his last one,</v>

581
00:25:18.041 --> 00:25:21.040
<v Speaker 5>which I thought was brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this one is totally.</v>

582
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:26.310
<v Speaker 5>It's like stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's all about the constitution and </v>

583
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:27.970
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's inspiring to see like,</v>

584
00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:33.140
<v Speaker 5>because he never takes the easy road.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I buy a column because he never </v>

585
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.680
<v Speaker 5>goes for the easy Dick joke or the cheap</v>
<v Speaker 5>angle.</v>

586
00:25:35.681 --> 00:25:39.280
<v Speaker 5>Like he fucking toughs it out and if </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's bombing on stage at the cellar,</v>

587
00:25:39.281 --> 00:25:42.610
<v Speaker 5>he takes it like a man and he works it </v>
<v Speaker 5>out and he makes it funny,</v>

588
00:25:42.611 --> 00:25:44.470
<v Speaker 5>like he's really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

589
00:25:44.471 --> 00:25:46.120
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just above everybody I think.</v>

590
00:25:46.121 --> 00:25:49.630
<v Speaker 5>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I put him at the top above all comics to</v>

591
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.900
<v Speaker 5>do an hour on the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could do maybe three minutes and I </v>

592
00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.530
<v Speaker 5>would immediately go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how big Jefferson's thick would</v>

593
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:59.470
<v Speaker 5>lapse right into the fucking slave </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking.</v>

594
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.360
<v Speaker 5>But okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to stop you right there.</v>

595
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:02.070
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

596
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:05.040
<v Speaker 3>there's anything wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what you do,</v>

597
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.980
<v Speaker 3>and I love Khan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Colin is hilarious,</v>

598
00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.830
<v Speaker 3>but honestly I'd rather see you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

599
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:15.950
<v Speaker 3>The reason being is because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up dude and you're going to say </v>

600
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:16.230
<v Speaker 3>some fucked up shit and it's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>

601
00:26:16.231 --> 00:26:18.330
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to say some nutty shit.</v>

602
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.500
<v Speaker 3>Colon talking about the constitution </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be fascinating and I think I enjoy</v>

603
00:26:22.501 --> 00:26:24.120
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I completely different level,</v>

604
00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:28.140
<v Speaker 3>but for sheer laughs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm wanting to just goof on shit,</v>

605
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.500
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see an act like yours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you,</v>

606
00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.480
<v Speaker 3>because because you're having fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

607
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:38.540
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm having a show on the </v>

608
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.300
<v Speaker 3>constitution is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is very,</v>

609
00:26:39.301 --> 00:26:44.301
<v Speaker 3>very difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also very difficult to do a </v>

610
00:26:44.301 --> 00:26:44.301
<v Speaker 3>show the way you're it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

611
00:26:44.301 --> 00:26:49.040
<v Speaker 4>really hard to do what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why there's so very few people </v>

612
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.071
<v Speaker 4>who are as honest as you warm when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're onstage as open about your </v>

613
00:26:52.071 --> 00:26:55.500
<v Speaker 4>perversions and as lovable in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like very difficult to do.</v>

614
00:26:55.501 --> 00:27:00.501
<v Speaker 4>Like you shouldn't sell that short.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what you do is just as much of an </v>

615
00:27:00.501 --> 00:27:00.740
<v Speaker 4>art form as what Colin does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would,</v>

616
00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:02.870
<v Speaker 4>I love to see both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get me wrong,</v>

617
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.130
<v Speaker 4>but you can't say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

618
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:09.630
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy that style of comedy and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking hard to do.</v>

619
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:14.660
<v Speaker 4>That's why there's only like at all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good dirty comics in this </v>

620
00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:15.960
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many of them are there really?</v>

621
00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:21.100
<v Speaker 4>Or even a dozen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there even a dozen that you would go </v>

622
00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.230
<v Speaker 4>out of your way to see at a $300,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million people?</v>

623
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.850
<v Speaker 4>Is there even a dozen really perverted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dirty guys that you would go say,</v>

624
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.010
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

625
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:30.870
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking.</v>

626
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:35.900
<v Speaker 4>It's a very difficult thing to cultivate</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get to that point.</v>

627
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:36.640
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

628
00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:41.670
<v Speaker 4>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I don't mind doing dirty </v>

629
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:41.670
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if I'm being truthful,</v>

630
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:45.680
<v Speaker 4>I just don't like doing it when I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like prior said that he said </v>

631
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.381
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker or nigger too much at times</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a crutch and he knew when he was </v>

632
00:27:48.381 --> 00:27:49.920
<v Speaker 4>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I don't want to do it as a crutch.</v>

633
00:27:49.921 --> 00:27:52.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to like use it as priors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Motherfucker,</v>

634
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.500
<v Speaker 4>if I'm doing it because I want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm cool with it.</v>

635
00:27:55.501 --> 00:27:57.900
<v Speaker 4>I'll be as filthy as you want to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>tranny jokes.</v>

636
00:27:57.901 --> 00:28:02.901
<v Speaker 4>I'll talk about being shit on whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I'm doing it because I fuck,</v>

637
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:04.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

638
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.780
<v Speaker 4>And you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like then I feel like I'm doing the</v>

639
00:28:06.781 --> 00:28:09.710
<v Speaker 4>equivalent of a fart sound and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I didn't sell myself.</v>

640
00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:15.210
<v Speaker 4>That is the big leap that you make as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>comic when you get past just doing stuff</v>

641
00:28:15.211 --> 00:28:19.890
<v Speaker 4>that works to doing stuff that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe in that and it works because you</v>

642
00:28:19.891 --> 00:28:21.480
<v Speaker 4>believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like a trick.</v>

643
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.360
<v Speaker 4>It's not like just a feeling that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>

644
00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:29.100
<v Speaker 4>When I remember doing material that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>dirty when I was first starting out,</v>

645
00:28:29.101 --> 00:28:34.101
<v Speaker 4>like one of the things that I would </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember is how awkward it was when I </v>

646
00:28:34.101 --> 00:28:38.931
<v Speaker 4>was forcing it when I was like bombing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was trying to make like it was </v>

647
00:28:38.931 --> 00:28:38.940
<v Speaker 4>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't funny.</v>

648
00:28:38.941 --> 00:28:43.941
<v Speaker 4>It was just bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're dirty especially it's like </v>

649
00:28:43.941 --> 00:28:43.941
<v Speaker 4>extra awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

650
00:28:43.941 --> 00:28:48.461
<v Speaker 4>it's like a giant echo in the room </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you finished with con and you're</v>

651
00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.750
<v Speaker 4>like so disappointed in yourself back </v>
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

652
00:28:51.751 --> 00:28:54.870
<v Speaker 4>I was like always disappointed in myself</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I could never go clean.</v>

653
00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:58.110
<v Speaker 4>So that guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could probably have a career.</v>

654
00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.230
<v Speaker 4>I thought I could do well as a clean </v>
<v Speaker 4>comic,</v>

655
00:29:01.231 --> 00:29:03.180
<v Speaker 4>but for whatever reason I just wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>

656
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:04.580
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

657
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.210
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why can't you just be clean?</v>

658
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:08.760
<v Speaker 4>So when I would bomb if I bombed dirty </v>
<v Speaker 4>or be like,</v>

659
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.660
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

660
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm strict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Humiliating.</v>

661
00:29:12.181 --> 00:29:14.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was clean.</v>

662
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.700
<v Speaker 4>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find that there's.</v>

663
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't find any extra valor and </v>
<v Speaker 4>cleanliness.</v>

664
00:29:17.971 --> 00:29:19.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a good thing to do if you're really</v>

665
00:29:19.501 --> 00:29:20.220
<v Speaker 4>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>clean,</v>

666
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:25.490
<v Speaker 4>but I think that they both have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're both equally acceptable if </v>

667
00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:25.500
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're original and funny.</v>

668
00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.510
<v Speaker 4>Like I agree with guys that stink and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

669
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate cute euphemisms and uh,</v>

670
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then she was giving me a kiss on Mike.</v>

671
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.590
<v Speaker 4>Man Under TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't say cocker,</v>

672
00:29:40.591 --> 00:29:45.591
<v Speaker 4>I get that right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you're trying to cute it up at </v>

673
00:29:45.591 --> 00:29:45.591
<v Speaker 4>a nightclub,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes me,</v>

674
00:29:45.591 --> 00:29:48.100
<v Speaker 4>it physically makes me ill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm embarrassed for comments.</v>

675
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:50.980
<v Speaker 4>That dude right there be an embarrassing</v>
<v Speaker 4>person to talk to.</v>

676
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:56.040
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine how many conversation </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a person like that and you're </v>

677
00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.100
<v Speaker 4>sitting down and having a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the person that is just just goofy </v>

678
00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:03.790
<v Speaker 4>and Dorky and you don't want to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 4>a person who doesn't swear.</v>

679
00:30:03.791 --> 00:30:06.340
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't tell you like one on one.</v>

680
00:30:06.341 --> 00:30:07.760
<v Speaker 4>Tell me what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

681
00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.210
<v Speaker 4>and then she's talking to my cock and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't believe it's happening.</v>

682
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell that.</v>

683
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.850

<v Speaker 4>if you exclude anything weird or twisted</v>

686
00:30:19.061 --> 00:30:20.530
<v Speaker 4>about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never gonna really,</v>

687
00:30:20.531 --> 00:30:21.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

688
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

689
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.580
<v Speaker 4>that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard for people to do.</v>

690
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:29.670
<v Speaker 4>People don't like to include that and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand that I'm in a job and you're </v>

691
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:32.701
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're in a job where it's a little </v>

692
00:30:32.701 --> 00:30:33.040
<v Speaker 4>easier for us because almost most things</v>
<v Speaker 4>are acceptable in our business.</v>

693
00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:38.041
<v Speaker 4>Like as a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard as an accountant to walk in </v>

694
00:30:38.041 --> 00:30:40.981
<v Speaker 4>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking went out with this girl and </v>

695
00:30:40.981 --> 00:30:41.320
<v Speaker 4>she's blowing me and I realized she had </v>
<v Speaker 4>a dick but I was high and I let her,</v>

696
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:44.050
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't walk into an accounting office</v>

697
00:30:44.051 --> 00:30:46.300
<v Speaker 4>and tell anybody that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you say that as a comic,</v>

698
00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:47.080
<v Speaker 4>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

699
00:30:47.081 --> 00:30:47.950
<v Speaker 4>so uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is the Gig?</v>

700
00:30:47.951 --> 00:30:50.110
<v Speaker 4>And we don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're hard to shock.</v>

701
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.960
<v Speaker 4>But that you could come to a room full </v>
<v Speaker 4>of comics,</v>

702
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:58.050
<v Speaker 4>a writer's room and tell that story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And instantly everybody would be </v>

703
00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:58.050
<v Speaker 4>laughing.</v>

704
00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:58.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't care.</v>

705
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:03.120
<v Speaker 4>We were harder to surprise and we accept</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot more and we can speak our mind a </v>

706
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:03.520
<v Speaker 4>lot more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

707
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:08.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a line where we know that goes </v>

708
00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.120
<v Speaker 4>beyond that where people are just being </v>
<v Speaker 4>unnecessarily adorable and not revealing</v>

709
00:31:10.121 --> 00:31:12.420
<v Speaker 4>and I hate them for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really.</v>

710
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:13.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

711
00:31:13.031 --> 00:31:14.040
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>

712
00:31:14.041 --> 00:31:14.770
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

713
00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.560
<v Speaker 4>they're putting on an act either that or</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're a crazy person.</v>

714
00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:22.620
<v Speaker 4>I think that putting on an act and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>to say everybody has to be a speaking </v>

715
00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.350
<v Speaker 4>racially insensitive language would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>this way,</v>

716
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.060
<v Speaker 4>but to judge it like they don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Wiener,</v>

717
00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what the guy does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for people,</v>

718
00:31:28.841 --> 00:31:33.841
<v Speaker 4>for men to act like I can't comprehend </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking a picture of my cock and course </v>

719
00:31:33.841 --> 00:31:38.840
<v Speaker 4>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all understand why he does what he </v>

720
00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:38.840
<v Speaker 4>does know.</v>

721
00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.980
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys don't cheat but to,</v>

722
00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:44.000
<v Speaker 4>to act appalled that he wants to get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dick.</v>

723
00:31:44.001 --> 00:31:46.930
<v Speaker 4>So people were enjoying claiming the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moral high ground,</v>

724
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

725
00:31:48.191 --> 00:31:53.191
<v Speaker 4>they love to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's going to happen in the </v>

726
00:31:53.191 --> 00:31:53.191
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Less and less,</v>

727
00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:58.260
<v Speaker 4>I think as the technology becomes more </v>
<v Speaker 4>intertwined in our lives,</v>

728
00:31:58.931 --> 00:32:00.490
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be less and less </v>
<v Speaker 4>privacy.</v>

729
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:05.950
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be less and less of </v>
<v Speaker 4>grandstanding or there's going to be </v>

730
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:09.231
<v Speaker 4>people that do it and get caught like </v>
<v Speaker 4>wiener or Eliot Spitzer is perfect </v>

731
00:32:09.231 --> 00:32:12.871
<v Speaker 4>example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a guy who was the mayor of New </v>

732
00:32:12.871 --> 00:32:15.840
<v Speaker 4>York or the governor of New York and was</v>
<v Speaker 4>arresting prostitution rings but was </v>

733
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.540
<v Speaker 4>also using them like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of the craziest ideas ever</v>

734
00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.720
<v Speaker 4>and so when you get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody's going to feel bad.</v>

735
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.490
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing man?</v>

736
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:25.370
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

737
00:32:25.371 --> 00:32:27.750
<v Speaker 4>you didn't just use a prostitute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

738
00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:31.330
<v Speaker 4>you were arresting them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were like shutting down prostitution</v>

739
00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:33.250
<v Speaker 4>rings and then you were using </v>
<v Speaker 4>prostitutes.</v>

740
00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:35.120
<v Speaker 4>Like he can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

741
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:37.120
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the equivalent of your agent double</v>

742
00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 4>dipping that it's immoral on every level</v>

743
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.110
<v Speaker 3>and it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

744
00:32:42.111 --> 00:32:47.111
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy to arrest him in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>place for getting paid to do something </v>

745
00:32:47.111 --> 00:32:48.590
<v Speaker 3>that's perfectly legal to do free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they just fucked.</v>

746
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.330
<v Speaker 3>If they just had a website that say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

747
00:32:50.331 --> 00:32:53.270
<v Speaker 3>let's meet up and fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one would have a problem with that,</v>

748
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.940
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because some money's being exchanged.</v>

749
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:58.430
<v Speaker 3>What does it really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a tax issue?</v>

750
00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:01.460
<v Speaker 3>It just then say that's what it is and </v>
<v Speaker 3>let's figure out how to tax it.</v>

751
00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:06.690
<v Speaker 3>Morals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's their idea of what the </v>

752
00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:06.690
<v Speaker 3>morals are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous.</v>

753
00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:09.521
<v Speaker 3>As soon as it's free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as it's free and you can do it </v>

754
00:33:09.521 --> 00:33:11.180
<v Speaker 3>and there's no problem whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you charge money for it,</v>

755
00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.800
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a crime.</v>

756
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:17.950
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous because if somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>just wanted to fuck if some crazy woman </v>

757
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:18.380
<v Speaker 3>just wanting to go around town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

758
00:33:18.381 --> 00:33:19.400
<v Speaker 3>meet me here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's fuck,</v>

759
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:21.290
<v Speaker 3>and then 10:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to meet another guy.</v>

760
00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:21.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck him.</v>

761
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.720
<v Speaker 3>No one can say a Goddamn word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

762
00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:27.350
<v Speaker 3>But because money's being exchanged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the sudden she's a criminal.</v>

763
00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:32.580
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I believe I'm a big fan of </v>

764
00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:32.580
<v Speaker 3>legalizing prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

765
00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.390
<v Speaker 3>it should be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should.</v>

766
00:33:33.391 --> 00:33:36.350
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be mandatory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it should be legal.</v>

767
00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.940
<v Speaker 3>You should be able to do whatever you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to do.</v>

768
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:42.970
<v Speaker 3>It'd be safer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was illegal and I think a lot of our </v>

769
00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:42.970
<v Speaker 3>ideas about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

770
00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:44.090
<v Speaker 3>obviously I don't want my daughters to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be prostitutes,</v>

771
00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.210
<v Speaker 3>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think a lot of our ideas of what's</v>

772
00:33:47.211 --> 00:33:52.211
<v Speaker 3>so horrible about prostitution is all </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on this puritanism bullshit that </v>

773
00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:54.740
<v Speaker 3>we've been pushing this country from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gecko.</v>

774
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.920
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing wrong with being nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with having </v>

775
00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.680
<v Speaker 3>morals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you push your own bullshit on </v>

776
00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.620
<v Speaker 3>other people and arrest them for giving </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand jobs,</v>

777
00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine?</v>

778
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:08.270
<v Speaker 3>You can rub your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could rub my feet to the cows,</v>

779
00:34:08.271 --> 00:34:11.030
<v Speaker 3>come home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could rub my ass cheeks.</v>

780
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:16.090
<v Speaker 3>That's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it feels too good when he rubbed my </v>

781
00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:16.090
<v Speaker 3>deck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So don't do that.</v>

782
00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:16.090
<v Speaker 3>Put you in a cage.</v>

783
00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:20.370
<v Speaker 2>You just have to have food involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much like you have to give him a </v>

784
00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:20.370
<v Speaker 2>sandwich first and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

785
00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:21.640
<v Speaker 2>I gave you food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to my place.</v>

786
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:23.670
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between a date </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

787
00:34:23.671 --> 00:34:27.100
<v Speaker 2>and you know you're spending $100 on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>date or $100.</v>

788
00:34:27.101 --> 00:34:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Just hair didn't have the money.</v>

789
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:30.450
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

790
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.370
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your.</v>

791
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Although you're spending money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're spending money to try to show the</v>

792
00:34:34.521 --> 00:34:36.920
<v Speaker 3>woman that you are a generous person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to take care of her,</v>

793
00:34:36.921 --> 00:34:41.921
<v Speaker 3>and then the sex is a mutual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is just that the men should be </v>

794
00:34:41.931 --> 00:34:45.260
<v Speaker 3>paying for the woman because they're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>worth as much,</v>

795
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:48.230
<v Speaker 3>which I agree with what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

796
00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:49.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

797
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:53.060
<v Speaker 3>it's way easy for a girl yet laid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is for a guy just so you got to pay</v>

798
00:34:53.061 --> 00:34:55.490
<v Speaker 3>for dinner as seems like they have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>upper hand.</v>

799
00:34:55.491 --> 00:34:56.690
<v Speaker 3>Socially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty obvious.</v>

800
00:34:56.691 --> 00:34:57.420
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And paper,</v>

801
00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.440
<v Speaker 3>fucking dinner buddy walks in with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy on this leg and even then you </v>

802
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.740
<v Speaker 3>gotta fucking smell your buddy's brad </v>
<v Speaker 3>neck.</v>

803
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:11.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking working all over your </v>

804
00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:11.750
<v Speaker 3>carpet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your buddies squirt.</v>

805
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Not Hot at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know if your girls squirts all of </v>

806
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:18.160
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

807
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.340
<v Speaker 3>your couch doesn't bother you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Throw a towel down.</v>

808
00:35:19.341 --> 00:35:23.270
<v Speaker 3>If I came over into and while I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking your leg,</v>

809
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:28.930
<v Speaker 3>clear blitz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What of genetic engineering leads to </v>

810
00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:33.551
<v Speaker 3>that dude?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just start putting vaginas on their </v>

811
00:35:33.551 --> 00:35:33.551
<v Speaker 3>elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang each other's forearms.</v>

812
00:35:33.551 --> 00:35:35.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's gonna be someone's going to offer</v>

813
00:35:35.991 --> 00:35:38.340
<v Speaker 3>that option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If option becomes available,</v>

814
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.590
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to be the guy who gets a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vagina on his thigh.</v>

815
00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>

816
00:35:41.881 --> 00:35:46.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his friend will fuck it at a party </v>

817
00:35:46.881 --> 00:35:47.310
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden we all start getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeast infections in our legs.</v>

818
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric Holder said today that they need to</v>

819
00:35:51.181 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 1>stop arresting people for petty </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana crimes and crimes where,</v>

820
00:35:55.951 --> 00:35:59.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no victims or whether it's not a</v>

821
00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:04.460
<v Speaker 1>connection to a drug cartels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's like sort of snuck in under </v>

822
00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.270
<v Speaker 1>the radar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a gigantic statement from the</v>

823
00:36:06.271 --> 00:36:08.820
<v Speaker 1>attorney general that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like basically stopped this,</v>

824
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:14.060
<v Speaker 1>this aspect of the drug war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to let people out of jail or </v>

825
00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 1>prisons or fucking overcrowded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is two things in the last week</v>

826
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:22.460
<v Speaker 1>that had been really surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sanjay goop does CNN thing where </v>

827
00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:25.000
<v Speaker 1>he's coming out with a documentary on </v>
<v Speaker 1>CNN called weed,</v>

828
00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:30.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year long investigation to the </v>

829
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:32.690
<v Speaker 1>positive benefits of medical marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these people that are sick and </v>

830
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.901
<v Speaker 1>all the different things that it cures </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different ailments that </v>

831
00:36:35.901 --> 00:36:39.380
<v Speaker 1>alleviates symptoms and this guy is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out and putting out this big </v>

832
00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.290
<v Speaker 1>piece on CNN.com.</v>

833
00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:45.290
<v Speaker 1>And the special saying I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for years I believed mainstream </v>

834
00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:46.890
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his opinion about marijuana,</v>

835
00:36:46.891 --> 00:36:51.891
<v Speaker 1>it was a bunch of lazy slackers and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that most of the medical </v>

836
00:36:51.891 --> 00:36:51.891
<v Speaker 1>marijuana was just people trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>

837
00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.780
<v Speaker 1>But now he realizes it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like there's massive,</v>

838
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:57.330
<v Speaker 1>massive medical benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Losing power.</v>

839
00:36:57.331 --> 00:37:00.020
<v Speaker 1>My Di Lithium crystals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're getting ready to attend.</v>

840
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I think they're getting ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our captain,</v>

841
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.560
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

842
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:08.640
<v Speaker 1>If CNN puts it on tv like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's pretty crazy.</v>

843
00:37:08.641 --> 00:37:13.641
<v Speaker 1>And then Eric holder saying we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop arresting people for petty crimes </v>

844
00:37:13.641 --> 00:37:16.530
<v Speaker 1>that don't involve drug cartels and </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana offenses.</v>

845
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

846
00:37:18.541 --> 00:37:23.070
<v Speaker 1>That isn't that like 50 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison because the problem is nonviolent</v>

847
00:37:23.071 --> 00:37:28.071
<v Speaker 1>drug offenders or a giant part of what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the prison system and making people </v>

848
00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:32.700
<v Speaker 1>much more likely to continue being </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminals.</v>

849
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Like once you start putting people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail,</v>

850
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:37.320
<v Speaker 1>that's when they're much more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start repeating crimes.</v>

851
00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:42.620
<v Speaker 1>The idea of punishing people by putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in jail doesn't really scares the </v>

852
00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:43.140
<v Speaker 1>shit out of 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they're smart,</v>

853
00:37:43.141 --> 00:37:48.141
<v Speaker 1>they don't do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also introduces them to a bunch </v>

854
00:37:48.141 --> 00:37:50.871
<v Speaker 1>of other people that are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminals and they all get together and </v>

855
00:37:50.871 --> 00:37:53.331
<v Speaker 1>they talk and they figured out what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck they're going to do together and </v>

856
00:37:53.331 --> 00:37:54.990
<v Speaker 1>once they get out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a way of turning a person who</v>

857
00:37:54.991 --> 00:37:59.991
<v Speaker 1>just wants to sell something that should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be legal into a fucking criminal by </v>

858
00:37:59.991 --> 00:38:01.800
<v Speaker 1>putting them in a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what else in there?</v>

859
00:38:01.801 --> 00:38:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Figuring that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

860
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government always seems to be a few,</v>

861
00:38:05.731 --> 00:38:07.860
<v Speaker 1>a little behind on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

862
00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:09.820
<v Speaker 1>on uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

863
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:14.960
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always the last ones to show up </v>

864
00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:15.620
<v Speaker 1>and say yes to something or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to cover every angle at it and</v>

865
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:20.630
<v Speaker 1>they have to realize that they can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>control it and then they have to figure </v>

866
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.630
<v Speaker 1>out how to make money off it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

867
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:21.660
<v Speaker 1>But this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this seems like a shift.</v>

868
00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:27.220
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a shift in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in just the way they communicate about </v>

869
00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:27.930
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

870
00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are new reforms aimed at </v>
<v Speaker 1>curbing US prison population.</v>

871
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:36.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a big article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Guardian about this.</v>

872
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.890
<v Speaker 1>This is a pretty crazy shit</v>

873
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:44.610
<v Speaker 2>that the tobacco company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even talk to a company probably </v>

874
00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:44.610
<v Speaker 2>went to the government was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

875
00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:49.051
<v Speaker 2>we're losing shitloads of money because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing your fucking our crops up </v>

876
00:38:49.051 --> 00:38:49.051
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making cigarettes so bad.</v>

877
00:38:49.051 --> 00:38:51.480
<v Speaker 2>We want to get into this weed game and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

878
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:57.270
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's like a way for Marlboro and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these companies to keep a keep </v>

879
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.270
<v Speaker 2>alive.</v>

880
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that.</v>

881
00:38:57.931 --> 00:39:02.931
<v Speaker 1>It's also the projected revenue tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenue from legalizing marijuana is </v>

882
00:39:02.931 --> 00:39:05.670
<v Speaker 1>giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's billions in every state.</v>

883
00:39:05.671 --> 00:39:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the projected tax revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds so crazy,</v>

884
00:39:10.351 --> 00:39:13.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's really true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could fix the United States economy.</v>

885
00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:16.950
<v Speaker 1>That sounds fucking nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really could.</v>

886
00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:22.040
<v Speaker 1>There's so much money involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana and right now it's all </v>

887
00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:27.021
<v Speaker 1>slipping through the cracks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all going on either illegally or </v>

888
00:39:27.021 --> 00:39:28.440
<v Speaker 1>its state as a medicinal sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

889
00:39:28.441 --> 00:39:31.920
<v Speaker 1>and then they get eventually busted by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dea because it's not federal.</v>

890
00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:36.060
<v Speaker 1>If they ease up that it changes our </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole culture,</v>

891
00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:40.680
<v Speaker 1>it's going to change everything at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People realize all the things you can do</v>

892
00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.980
<v Speaker 1>with marijuana that don't involve </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting high when you,</v>

893
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.290
<v Speaker 1>when they realize that the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hamp,</v>

894
00:39:46.291 --> 00:39:49.740
<v Speaker 1>which has been illegal forever in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking country since the 19 thirties,</v>

895
00:39:49.741 --> 00:39:54.741
<v Speaker 1>as long as marijuana has been illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't grow hemp and the non </v>

896
00:39:54.741 --> 00:39:58.971
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive form of marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the stocks of marijuana make it </v>

897
00:39:58.971 --> 00:40:00.300
<v Speaker 1>insanely good paper.</v>

898
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:05.480
<v Speaker 1>They make tremendous building materials </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are biodegradable and lasts forever</v>

899
00:40:05.641 --> 00:40:07.830
<v Speaker 1>and are stronger than steel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

900
00:40:07.831 --> 00:40:12.831
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny fucking plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's got essential amino acids in </v>

901
00:40:12.831 --> 00:40:16.791
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can eat the protein from it because </v>

902
00:40:16.791 --> 00:40:16.791
<v Speaker 1>it gets you higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

903
00:40:16.791 --> 00:40:16.791
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can get you high,</v>

904
00:40:16.791 --> 00:40:18.390
<v Speaker 1>but mean the stock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stock doesn't know.</v>

905
00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you get the female flowers or </v>
<v Speaker 1>we get you high,</v>

906
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:27.380
<v Speaker 1>so what you're getting when you get him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you're either getting various </v>

907
00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:31.281
<v Speaker 1>strains which which are like we would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think technically you wouldn't refer </v>

908
00:40:31.741 --> 00:40:36.741
<v Speaker 1>to it as a cousin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does get referred to as a cousin </v>

909
00:40:36.741 --> 00:40:36.741
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people correct me online,</v>

910
00:40:36.741 --> 00:40:39.180
<v Speaker 1>so just that caveat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's essentially the male version of</v>

911
00:40:39.181 --> 00:40:44.181
<v Speaker 1>the plant and variations of the male </v>
<v Speaker 1>versions of the plant and that doesn't </v>

912
00:40:44.191 --> 00:40:49.191
<v Speaker 1>have any psychoactive properties to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can make fucking ridiculously </v>

913
00:40:49.191 --> 00:40:49.890
<v Speaker 1>strong rope with it.</v>

914
00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a weird plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you'll take a stock of this stuff.</v>

915
00:40:53.251 --> 00:40:58.251
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it like this thick is light </v>

916
00:40:58.251 --> 00:40:58.251
<v Speaker 1>like styrofoam but hard as a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock.</v>

917
00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.900
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird fucking plant.</v>

918
00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like no plant that exists on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really almost like it's an alien.</v>

919
00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:09.030
<v Speaker 1>It's such a strange plant and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial to humankind.</v>

920
00:41:09.031 --> 00:41:13.830
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it's illegal is I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the psychoactive effects,</v>

921
00:41:13.831 --> 00:41:16.710
<v Speaker 1>if it had no effect on the human body </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

922
00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:21.860
<v Speaker 1>just for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your ability to use in building </v>

923
00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.621
<v Speaker 1>materials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to make clothes and paper </v>

924
00:41:24.621 --> 00:41:25.720
<v Speaker 1>and oil and Henry Ford's first fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>car had him,</v>

925
00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:26.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

926
00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:31.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the body panels were made out of </v>

927
00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.440
<v Speaker 1>hemp and it ran on hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he would make oil from hemp and run</v>

928
00:41:33.441 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 1>engines</v>

929
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:34.850
<v Speaker 5>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

930
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:36.410
<v Speaker 5>you can do so much shit with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

931
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:41.620
<v Speaker 5>it's almost a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you look at all the different </v>

932
00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:41.660
<v Speaker 5>things you could do with it and how </v>
<v Speaker 5>could it be legal?</v>

933
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:46.690
<v Speaker 5>How could it be illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rather you wonder why there are certain </v>

934
00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:46.690
<v Speaker 5>things like I wonder why we can't go to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cuba.</v>

935
00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:49.160
<v Speaker 5>There are certain things that government</v>
<v Speaker 5>does that a get a point.</v>

936
00:41:49.161 --> 00:41:50.840
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

937
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:55.841
<v Speaker 5>Like after awhile it's like enough is </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough of these little things like why </v>

938
00:41:55.841 --> 00:41:56.270
<v Speaker 5>can't I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a baby.</v>

939
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:59.540
<v Speaker 5>We're not babies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's what these things are</v>

940
00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:04.541
<v Speaker 5>realizing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a push by the American people </v>

941
00:42:04.541 --> 00:42:07.120
<v Speaker 5>and there's a transparency that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>American people are demanding and under </v>

942
00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.330
<v Speaker 5>the weight of things like Edward Snowden</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

943
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.920
<v Speaker 5>Bradley manning you all these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these documents that to get it released </v>

944
00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.460
<v Speaker 5>where people are seeing the actual inner</v>
<v Speaker 5>workings of the government,</v>

945
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:22.030
<v Speaker 5>they have to make some radical reform if</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want to keep a hold of us because </v>

946
00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:23.870
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people that are upset </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now finding out about the NSA,</v>

947
00:42:23.871 --> 00:42:26.510
<v Speaker 5>watching every single American is if </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're all bad.</v>

948
00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.670
<v Speaker 5>But how about all of us?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who Do?</v>

949
00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.470
<v Speaker 5>Can I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can it be like the Tsa?</v>

950
00:42:30.471 --> 00:42:33.570
<v Speaker 5>Can I get up to tsa pre where you know </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I'm not a fucking terrorist.</v>

951
00:42:33.571 --> 00:42:35.210
<v Speaker 5>So you stop reading my email Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Juan,</v>

952
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.010
<v Speaker 5>can I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>can we make that deal?</v>

953
00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:42.070
<v Speaker 5>I have mixed feelings about the NSA.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am a part of me loves that they did </v>

954
00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:45.860
<v Speaker 5>that because the American people have </v>
<v Speaker 5>become such.</v>

955
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:51.820
<v Speaker 5>What bothers me about Americans is we </v>
<v Speaker 5>become such nosy pigs into each other's </v>

956
00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:55.400
<v Speaker 5>lives and there's nothing in American </v>
<v Speaker 5>loves more than violating the privacy of</v>

957
00:42:55.401 --> 00:42:56.330
<v Speaker 5>somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>True.</v>

958
00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.480
<v Speaker 5>Nothing we love more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now all of the sudden we don't like </v>

959
00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.470
<v Speaker 5>it because someone's invading our </v>
<v Speaker 5>privacy.</v>

960
00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.630
<v Speaker 5>Like I believe I get the difference of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the government doing.</v>

961
00:43:05.631 --> 00:43:10.631
<v Speaker 5>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean just the principle of it </v>

962
00:43:10.631 --> 00:43:11.870
<v Speaker 5>where all these fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've said this before,</v>

963
00:43:11.871 --> 00:43:16.871
<v Speaker 5>crying about privacy when they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>get enough of Mel Gibson's private voice</v>

964
00:43:16.911 --> 00:43:21.500
<v Speaker 5>mails or Alec Baldwin's phone calls or </v>
<v Speaker 5>our tiger woods is private texts.</v>

965
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:24.800
<v Speaker 5>Now I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We look at them as entertainment value,</v>

966
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:30.190
<v Speaker 5>but people also are comfortable seeing </v>
<v Speaker 5>those things and making judgements and </v>

967
00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.120
<v Speaker 5>treating people a certain way because of</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

968
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:35.420
<v Speaker 5>So they didn't give a fuck that anybody </v>
<v Speaker 5>else's privacy was violated.</v>

969
00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.880
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their privacy is sacred.</v>

970
00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:40.720
<v Speaker 5>So I kind of like Google glass and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>liked this.</v>

971
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:42.350
<v Speaker 5>It evens the playing field.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>

972
00:43:42.351 --> 00:43:44.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like fucking does portray us.</v>

973
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:49.990
<v Speaker 5>The head of the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't fuck some chick on the side </v>

974
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.930
<v Speaker 5>when he's married to Michael Moore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How depressing is that?</v>

975
00:43:50.931 --> 00:43:52.460
<v Speaker 5>And no one gets away with anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

976
00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:57.580
<v Speaker 5>So I wish the American people would stop</v>
<v Speaker 5>being so nosy and minding everyone's </v>

977
00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:01.901
<v Speaker 5>business but their own.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I would completely be against the </v>

978
00:44:01.901 --> 00:44:01.901
<v Speaker 5>NSA,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but until that happens,</v>

979
00:44:01.901 --> 00:44:06.310
<v Speaker 5>fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love the fact that their privacy is </v>

980
00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:06.310
<v Speaker 5>being violated to and they can see how </v>
<v Speaker 5>it feels.</v>

981
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.480
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's an angry Jimmy Norris.</v>

982
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:10.280
<v Speaker 5>Not even angry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just tired of not.</v>

983
00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:11.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even mad at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I know what you're saying.</v>

984
00:44:11.781 --> 00:44:16.781
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you to a certain extent </v>
<v Speaker 5>that self righteousness that people </v>

985
00:44:16.781 --> 00:44:17.090
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like with Paula Deen,</v>

986
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:22.450
<v Speaker 5>they're comfortable allowing her to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>lynched publicly and no one is stepping </v>

987
00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:27.011
<v Speaker 5>up and going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I've said some shitty </v>

988
00:44:27.011 --> 00:44:28.991
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one expresses that honesty in </v>

989
00:44:28.991 --> 00:44:31.541
<v Speaker 5>themselves and give each other breaks on</v>
<v Speaker 5>inappropriate things that we say or a </v>

990
00:44:31.541 --> 00:44:32.520
<v Speaker 5>little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're allowing moments</v>

991
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.300
<v Speaker 3>to define who people are and we all have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moments.</v>

992
00:44:36.301 --> 00:44:36.980
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

993
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:39.900
<v Speaker 3>it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we might not have the moments to the</v>

994
00:44:39.901 --> 00:44:41.580
<v Speaker 3>that varying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly that.</v>

995
00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:43.940
<v Speaker 3>The degree of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of fucked up attitude.</v>

996
00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:46.190
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I know she did a lot of.</v>

997
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:48.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what Paula Dean actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>

998
00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.550
<v Speaker 3>but if you listen to what the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that work with her,</v>

999
00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.430
<v Speaker 3>she sounds like she was a funny racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old white lady.</v>

1000
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't,</v>

1001
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.860
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to even guess of what it</v>

1002
00:44:58.861 --> 00:45:02.070
<v Speaker 3>would be like to be a black guy working </v>
<v Speaker 3>for her and hearing that shit coming out</v>

1003
00:45:02.071 --> 00:45:07.071
<v Speaker 3>of her mouth work though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if she did or supposedly </v>

1004
00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:07.680
<v Speaker 3>allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck knows?</v>

1005
00:45:07.681 --> 00:45:09.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I read.</v>

1006
00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.270
<v Speaker 3>That's what people were accusing her of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're there,</v>

1007
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.580
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In your.</v>

1008
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.230
<v Speaker 3>You're also dealing with disgruntled </v>
<v Speaker 3>employees.</v>

1009
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:21.320
<v Speaker 3>Wins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul Dean winds the resource suit that </v>

1010
00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:21.320
<v Speaker 3>destroyed her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does she win?</v>

1011
00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.280
<v Speaker 3>See her black friends that she hangs out</v>
<v Speaker 3>with?</v>

1012
00:45:22.281 --> 00:45:23.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's got black friends.</v>

1013
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:27.580
<v Speaker 3>No big black guy with the hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably gonna fucking cock.</v>

1014
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:28.680
<v Speaker 3>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1015
00:45:28.681 --> 00:45:29.610
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the judgment.</v>

1016
00:45:29.611 --> 00:45:30.240
<v Speaker 3>What does it say?</v>

1017
00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says that,</v>

1018
00:45:31.821 --> 00:45:32.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1019
00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:33.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the original lawsuit,</v>

1020
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000
<v Speaker 2>a judge ruled that Lisa Jackson had no </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to claim racial discrimination </v>

1021
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.841
<v Speaker 2>because she's white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any comments that dean or her cohorts </v>

1022
00:45:43.841 --> 00:45:44.510
<v Speaker 2>may have had had no legal consequences.</v>

1023
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:46.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she tried to claim rakes,</v>

1024
00:45:46.441 --> 00:45:49.050
<v Speaker 3>racial discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she was white.</v>

1025
00:45:49.051 --> 00:45:50.390
<v Speaker 3>She was just trying to get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1026
00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Dirty can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1027

<v Speaker 3>problem is that he's.</v>

1041

<v Speaker 3>terrified because he's in that box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for him to like try to.</v>

1044

1045

<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to have a conversation </v>

<v Speaker 3>not at all,</v>

1057
00:47:08.631 --> 00:47:10.620
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is an issue that really</v>
<v Speaker 3>needed to be addressed like that.</v>

1058
00:47:10.621 --> 00:47:15.621
<v Speaker 3>It's can't like have a quick Matt Lauer </v>
<v Speaker 3>interview with this scared lady in a </v>

1059
00:47:15.621 --> 00:47:19.731
<v Speaker 3>scared old lady that has fucking death </v>
<v Speaker 3>threats coming in from black people all </v>

1060
00:47:19.731 --> 00:47:21.660
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you know you can't.</v>

1061
00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:26.040
<v Speaker 3>You can't be a white person in 2013 </v>
<v Speaker 3>calling people niggers phony,</v>

1062
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:29.260
<v Speaker 3>phony outrage and studied with within </v>
<v Speaker 3>black people who get annoyed.</v>

1063
00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:29.770
<v Speaker 3>It is</v>

1064
00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.650
<v Speaker 5>when I've grown to hate his other white </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1065
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.840
<v Speaker 5>Patrice said it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Patrice said it best.</v>

1066
00:47:34.841 --> 00:47:36.280
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never met a racist.</v>

1067
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:41.490
<v Speaker 5>Not One person I've ever admitted </v>
<v Speaker 5>admitted has ever admitted they were </v>

1068
00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:44.611
<v Speaker 5>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what I hate about these fucking </v>

1069
00:47:44.611 --> 00:47:47.221
<v Speaker 5>these white people whose idea of </v>
<v Speaker 5>combating racism is just targeting other</v>

1070
00:47:47.321 --> 00:47:52.321
<v Speaker 5>white people who have said something </v>
<v Speaker 5>inappropriate is simply their way of </v>

1071
00:47:52.321 --> 00:47:53.560
<v Speaker 5>deflecting attention from themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 5>their own.</v>

1072
00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:58.620
<v Speaker 5>I think they have superiority complexes </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think like I can't walk up to my </v>

1073
00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:59.440
<v Speaker 5>black friends and tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1074
00:47:59.441 --> 00:48:01.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if Paula deen acts like one,</v>

1075
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:04.510
<v Speaker 5>then I can use her to mirror how good I </v>
<v Speaker 5>am.</v>

1076
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:08.980
<v Speaker 5>It's a self serving proposition and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>hate it and I don't buy it.</v>

1077
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.200
<v Speaker 5>I just don't buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1078
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:15.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you that there's a lot of </v>

1079
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.270
<v Speaker 5>people that love to do that moral high </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground.</v>

1080
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:20.040
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They loved by not by telling you that </v>

1081
00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.370
<v Speaker 5>you're doing something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not just telling you that you're</v>

1082
00:48:21.371 --> 00:48:26.371
<v Speaker 5>doing something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're telling you that they're </v>

1083
00:48:26.371 --> 00:48:26.371
<v Speaker 5>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1084
00:48:26.371 --> 00:48:27.610
<v Speaker 5>That's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's in their tone and it's in their</v>

1085
00:48:27.611 --> 00:48:32.611
<v Speaker 5>lack of the lack of self revealing they </v>
<v Speaker 5>do in these moments and in these </v>

1086
00:48:32.611 --> 00:48:37.351
<v Speaker 5>discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they revealed ugliness about </v>

1087
00:48:37.351 --> 00:48:37.351
<v Speaker 5>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would have respect for them.</v>

1088
00:48:37.351 --> 00:48:41.221
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why am I comfortable talking about a </v>

1089
00:48:41.221 --> 00:48:43.830
<v Speaker 5>paddle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian's dirty voicemails or tiger woods </v>

1090
00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:44.080
<v Speaker 5>is dirty text messages because I talk </v>
<v Speaker 5>about my own,</v>

1091
00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:46.170
<v Speaker 5>like I'll make fun of his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'll tell you that I,</v>

1092
00:48:46.171 --> 00:48:48.600
<v Speaker 5>I also have texted my cock to many </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1093
00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:54.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm a piece of shit so I'm not coming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not better than him and I refuse to </v>

1094
00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:54.480
<v Speaker 5>come off like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1095
00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:57.940
<v Speaker 5>there's a real problem with people </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking that you need to be better than</v>

1096
00:48:57.941 --> 00:49:02.941
<v Speaker 5>people too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like especially pretending that </v>

1097
00:49:02.941 --> 00:49:06.421
<v Speaker 5>should never work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So claiming the moral high ground and </v>

1098
00:49:06.421 --> 00:49:07.330
<v Speaker 5>becoming the super white knight and </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretending that you know,</v>

1099
00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:12.190
<v Speaker 5>you're there to defend all women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's this shit doesn't work.</v>

1100
00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:16.120
<v Speaker 5>It never works because the type of women</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get from faking that shit.</v>

1101
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:21.150
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might really be that guy and if you </v>

1102
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:21.150
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God bless you.</v>

1103
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:24.300
<v Speaker 5>But if you're faking it well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's going to trick one average girl </v>

1104
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.930
<v Speaker 5>with glasses and a stupid tattoo with </v>
<v Speaker 5>words on her arm,</v>

1105
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.610
<v Speaker 5>fucking blow fucking baggy jeans.</v>

1106
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.250
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to get much out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever banged a feminist?</v>

1107
00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:38.560
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure I have,</v>

1108
00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.420
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1109
00:49:40.421 --> 00:49:41.800
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1110
00:49:41.801 --> 00:49:44.680
<v Speaker 5>I've banged some very was I liked strong</v>
<v Speaker 5>women a lot.</v>

1111
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:49.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't like I'm strong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1112
00:49:50.261 --> 00:49:53.170
<v Speaker 5>I like that type of woman a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of them are sexually submissive,</v>

1113
00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:58.370
<v Speaker 5>like lawyers that I've fucked up in </v>
<v Speaker 5>sexual submissive female cops because </v>

1114
00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:58.480
<v Speaker 5>they're very strong and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1115
00:49:58.481 --> 00:50:00.450
<v Speaker 5>they liked something different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You all,</v>

1116
00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:05.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I have nothing against the feminist </v>

1117
00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:06.340
<v Speaker 5>if she's reasonable and she's fighting </v>
<v Speaker 5>for women to get what they deserve,</v>

1118
00:50:06.341 --> 00:50:11.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm for it when the language police and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they nitpick because their causes not as</v>

1119
00:50:11.231 --> 00:50:16.231
<v Speaker 5>needed as it was 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I hate their guts like any other </v>

1120
00:50:16.231 --> 00:50:19.261
<v Speaker 5>special interest group,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when they're fighting for what's </v>

1121
00:50:19.261 --> 00:50:19.530
<v Speaker 5>right and legitimately getting the right</v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of money and be like,</v>

1122
00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:21.430
<v Speaker 5>I don't think women should be sexually </v>
<v Speaker 5>harassed at work.</v>

1123
00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:26.730
<v Speaker 5>Like these guys had like this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>cock sucker in San Diego who's grabbing </v>

1124
00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 5>women and being a complete of shit and</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fuck that guy.</v>

1126
00:50:29.961 --> 00:50:32.480

<v Speaker 1>should fucking hit this guy with an ax.</v>

1127
00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would be hard to imagine your wife </v>

1128
00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:39.850
<v Speaker 1>being at work with some latch all day </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like constantly harassing him,</v>

1129
00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.570
<v Speaker 1>bothering her and brushes or cock buyer </v>
<v Speaker 1>when she walks by her in the hall,</v>

1130
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:46.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit that happens to people</v>

1131
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:47.990
<v Speaker 1>at work and people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But that's a can.</v>

1134
00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:54.560
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if he's a man or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

1135
00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:56.390
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1136
00:50:56.391 --> 00:51:01.391
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea of feminism is a good </v>

1137
00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:03.290
<v Speaker 1>idea as the idea of masculinism that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good idea to.</v>

1138
00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:08.320
<v Speaker 1>I want to think it's a real word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it was a real word to be a good </v>

1139
00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:08.320
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing,</v>

1140
00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:12.070
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with you being </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to be you and me being allowed </v>

1141
00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:13.700
<v Speaker 1>to be me and we're going to be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

1142
00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:16.670
<v Speaker 1>That's why the world varies so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why movies,</v>

1143
00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.080
<v Speaker 1>very music varies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's stand up.</v>

1144
00:51:19.081 --> 00:51:24.081
<v Speaker 1>Comedy varies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that like all kinds of </v>

1145
00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:26.621
<v Speaker 1>different shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of men don't want women to be </v>

1146
00:51:26.621 --> 00:51:28.280
<v Speaker 1>women and a lot of women don't want men </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be men.</v>

1147
00:51:28.281 --> 00:51:31.300
<v Speaker 1>They want them to be what they want them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be and when,</v>

1148
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:35.390
<v Speaker 1>when you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have some asshole who wants you</v>

1149
00:51:35.391 --> 00:51:39.830
<v Speaker 1>to be a certain way and you have to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that Dick and you're a woman,</v>

1150
00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:42.160
<v Speaker 1>that's a special place in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1151
00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:46.150
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking horrible place in hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has nothing to do with this.</v>

1152
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not a sex thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an all gender thing.</v>

1153
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:50.090
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a piece of shit.</v>

1154
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a picture.</v>

1155
00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:53.630
<v Speaker 1>You just found a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just happens to be a man,</v>

1156
00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:54.440
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>

1157
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:59.560
<v Speaker 1>If you're a man and you have a boss and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your boss is a woman and she's a fucking</v>

1158
00:51:59.601 --> 00:52:01.690
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who has a woman ball.</v>

1159
00:52:01.691 --> 00:52:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually just left his Gig,</v>

1160
00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:06.050
<v Speaker 1>but he had this woman boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We brutalized him.</v>

1161
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Just wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wouldn't leave them alone.</v>

1162
00:52:08.811 --> 00:52:11.800
<v Speaker 1>It was just like giving them cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like rotting Adam,</v>

1163
00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:16.810
<v Speaker 1>like all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day with someone who you couldn't </v>

1164
00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:19.571
<v Speaker 1>talk back to who was just fucking with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in pastoring you and B rating you </v>

1165
00:52:19.571 --> 00:52:22.490
<v Speaker 1>and insulting you and there's not a damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you can do to take it.</v>

1166
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Not a damn thing you can do about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was talking to him in a way that a </v>

1167
00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:28.930
<v Speaker 1>regular man would never like a man in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the street that did,</v>

1168
00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:33.940
<v Speaker 1>you didn't owe anything to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would never talk to you when she was </v>

1169
00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:33.940
<v Speaker 1>ready to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1170
00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:36.350
<v Speaker 1>But she would just get in his face and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed him and say crazy shit to him.</v>

1171
00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Has nothing to do now and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to get done and that's why she's</v>

1172
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:39.680
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1173
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she would ask him if he was </v>

1174
00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:45.160
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you stupid?</v>

1175
00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Are you stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in like,</v>

1176
00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.640
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to listen to this.</v>

1177
00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:48.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's nothing you can do about it.</v>

1178
00:52:48.351 --> 00:52:51.080
<v Speaker 1>You're just stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shouldn't be right.</v>

1179
00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:54.010
<v Speaker 1>And it shouldn't be right for any human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being to do that to another human being,</v>

1180
00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.180
<v Speaker 1>should have said stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is as stupid does,</v>

1181
00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.600
<v Speaker 1>and then given a khaki look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense,</v>

1182
00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:04.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a feminist and a lot of ways on </v>

1183
00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:04.690
<v Speaker 1>masculinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a humanist.</v>

1184
00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I think we should be able to do whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want.</v>

1185
00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:06.710
<v Speaker 1>The problem is when you start looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>out for your own,</v>

1186
00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:09.500
<v Speaker 1>when you start looking out for a gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a generalization,</v>

1187
00:53:09.501 --> 00:53:12.530
<v Speaker 1>you start going towards one gender only </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasizing that one.</v>

1188
00:53:12.531 --> 00:53:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Gender inequities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inadequacies in our society.</v>

1189
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:21.260
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you become a gang and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a part of a team.</v>

1190
00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>

1191
00:53:23.131 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 1>is that what I hate about people much as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

1192
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:27.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're,</v>

1193
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:29.880
<v Speaker 4>they're not consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't.</v>

1194
00:53:29.881 --> 00:53:32.400
<v Speaker 4>Everything should be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't want.</v>

1195
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:34.800
<v Speaker 4>Nothing should be different unless </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about diversity,</v>

1196
00:53:34.801 --> 00:53:38.130
<v Speaker 4>then it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like any kind of profiling.</v>

1197
00:53:38.131 --> 00:53:40.650
<v Speaker 4>It's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless of course it's a,</v>

1198
00:53:40.651 --> 00:53:43.370
<v Speaker 4>it's an ethnic pride parade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we can all profile.</v>

1199
00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.690
<v Speaker 4>It's a delightful idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be proud to be Irish.</v>

1200
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:50.550
<v Speaker 4>So people only want grand sweeping </v>
<v Speaker 4>generalizations when they're a part of a</v>

1201
00:53:50.551 --> 00:53:53.580
<v Speaker 4>good grand sweeping generalization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're a part of it.</v>

1202
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:58.630
<v Speaker 4>Like it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go through TSA security and they're </v>

1203
00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:00.060
<v Speaker 4>now saying anybody under 12 or over 75 </v>
<v Speaker 4>does not have to take your shoes off.</v>

1204
00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:03.540
<v Speaker 4>And I have not heard one person </v>
<v Speaker 4>complaining about age discrimination.</v>

1205
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:09.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm over 75.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why am I not being treated the same as </v>

1206
00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:11.541
<v Speaker 4>these other people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have not heard one fucking parent </v>

1207
00:54:11.541 --> 00:54:11.541
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my kids under 12.</v>

1208
00:54:11.541 --> 00:54:12.060
<v Speaker 4>Why aren't you treating them like </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody else?</v>

1209
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:15.450
<v Speaker 4>It's only when we're treated in a manner</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we don't approve of,</v>

1210
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:17.250
<v Speaker 4>that we take this principle of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1211
00:54:17.251 --> 00:54:18.480
<v Speaker 4>don't treat me differently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1212
00:54:18.481 --> 00:54:20.670
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's arbitrary and it's bullshit.</v>

1213
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:22.770
<v Speaker 4>So that's why you can't respect any of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1214
00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:24.490
<v Speaker 4>Makes me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:27.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a big fan of groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1216
00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:30.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm really not a big fan of groups have </v>
<v Speaker 4>focused on one gender.</v>

1217
00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:33.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big fan of generalizations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a big fan of a lot of things.</v>

1218
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:38.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm certainly not a big fan of anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>where anyone who is the weaker is </v>

1219
00:54:40.621 --> 00:54:42.800
<v Speaker 4>getting bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's physical,</v>

1220
00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:45.120
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a sexual thing or physical </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

1221
00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:49.020
<v Speaker 4>or a man bugging a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sister.</v>

1222
00:54:49.021 --> 00:54:50.340
<v Speaker 4>I have daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a wife,</v>

1223
00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:54.060
<v Speaker 4>I I 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1224
00:54:54.061 --> 00:54:59.061
<v Speaker 4>it's way more difficult to be a woman </v>
<v Speaker 4>than it is to be a man in the physical </v>

1225
00:54:59.061 --> 00:55:01.860
<v Speaker 4>sense and I think there should be laws </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that shit abso-fucking-lutely.</v>

1226
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:06.860
<v Speaker 4>I think that men who do abuse women or </v>
<v Speaker 4>who do sexually harassing their fucking </v>

1227
00:55:07.531 --> 00:55:10.320
<v Speaker 4>creepy people are tripping but so are </v>
<v Speaker 4>women who do it too,</v>

1228
00:55:10.321 --> 00:55:12.420
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the idea that that's not the case.</v>

1229
00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:17.440
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that a situation where a man </v>

1230
00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.300
<v Speaker 4>who gets taken by a woman in a divorce </v>
<v Speaker 4>and some fucking horrible way where you </v>

1231
00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:21.250
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you find.</v>

1232
00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:23.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could go into this for days,</v>

1233
00:55:23.911 --> 00:55:28.911
<v Speaker 4>but I'm sure we all know guys who just </v>
<v Speaker 4>been raped and divorce.</v>

1234
00:55:28.921 --> 00:55:30.170
<v Speaker 4>Some of us do radio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What day?</v>

1235
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:32.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anthony got murdered.</v>

1236
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:35.910
<v Speaker 4>I know some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a guy who lost millions.</v>

1237
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.640
<v Speaker 4>I know my favorite story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I even talked about them on my act.</v>

1238
00:55:38.641 --> 00:55:43.641
<v Speaker 4>He had to pay for his wife's attorney </v>
<v Speaker 4>and his wife dragged the thing out for </v>

1239
00:55:43.641 --> 00:55:45.840
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he is paying for the enemy's general,</v>

1240
00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:51.260
<v Speaker 4>so he's going to war for all of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>money and he winded up costing him </v>

1241
00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:51.260
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

1242
00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:56.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was just a devastating several</v>
<v Speaker 4>year event that she wouldn't.</v>

1243
00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:59.610
<v Speaker 4>She was doing it on purpose to try to </v>
<v Speaker 4>drag it out and to try to milk him.</v>

1244
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:02.040
<v Speaker 4>When you see some shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think like,</v>

1245
00:56:02.041 --> 00:56:03.960
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>men should have rights to.</v>

1246
00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:05.370
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1247
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:10.430
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not in a sense it's not the same </v>

1248
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.430
<v Speaker 4>thing as him being raped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1249
00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:14.190
<v Speaker 4>But he's being financially destroyed and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's.</v>

1250
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:19.340
<v Speaker 4>Someone's doing it in a spiteful way </v>
<v Speaker 4>when they're doing it because they just </v>

1251
00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.300
<v Speaker 4>grew to hate him or whatever the fuck it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

1252
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:25.030
<v Speaker 4>But there should be a law against that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they didn't even have children.</v>

1253
00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:27.460
<v Speaker 4>Like it was one of the craziest things </v>
<v Speaker 4>I've ever seen in my life.</v>

1254
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:32.700
<v Speaker 4>When you find out what happens if a man </v>
<v Speaker 4>and woman are together for x amount of </v>

1255
00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:36.571
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then he has to pay for her for the rest </v>

1256
00:56:36.571 --> 00:56:36.571
<v Speaker 4>of her life.</v>

1257
00:56:36.571 --> 00:56:36.571
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he doesn't get the fucker.</v>

1258
00:56:36.571 --> 00:56:36.760
<v Speaker 4>That's the beautiful part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like she's like,</v>

1259
00:56:36.761 --> 00:56:37.980
<v Speaker 4>well I have a lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

1260
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.860
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was expecting I,</v>

1261
00:56:38.861 --> 00:56:41.830
<v Speaker 4>I was used to getting blown and having </v>
<v Speaker 4>your ass in my face.</v>

1262
00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:43.780
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we're used to remember Chris Rock's</v>

1263
00:56:43.781 --> 00:56:48.781
<v Speaker 4>bit about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know about alimony and pussy </v>

1264
00:56:48.781 --> 00:56:48.781
<v Speaker 4>payments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1265
00:56:48.781 --> 00:56:48.781
<v Speaker 4>he had it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had a whole book,</v>

1266
00:56:48.781 --> 00:56:50.370
<v Speaker 4>a book about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I believe in Amway,</v>

1267
00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:53.970
<v Speaker 4>but I also believe in pussy payments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1268
00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:55.480
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1269
00:56:55.540 --> 00:57:00.540
<v Speaker 4>there's all sorts of inequality in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>world of both projected towards women </v>

1270
00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:05.650
<v Speaker 4>and projected towards men and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of assholes in the world,</v>

1271
00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:10.680
<v Speaker 4>both women and men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just assholes and that's a real </v>

1272
00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:14.371
<v Speaker 4>problem in this life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not lumping ourselves into groups </v>

1273
00:57:14.371 --> 00:57:15.760
<v Speaker 4>and generalizing that all women are good</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all men are bad or vice versa.</v>

1274
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:16.920
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy too.</v>

1275
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:22.190
<v Speaker 4>What's what's important is recognizing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's really only three types of </v>

1276
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.630
<v Speaker 4>people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Morons,</v>

1277
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:25.210
<v Speaker 4>assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people that are all right.</v>

1278
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:26.830
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might not agree with them.</v>

1279
00:57:26.831 --> 00:57:28.150
<v Speaker 4>You might not like them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might.</v>

1280
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.370
<v Speaker 4>They might not be your style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might be different.</v>

1281
00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:33.190
<v Speaker 4>Morons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>assholes,</v>

1282
00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:38.340
<v Speaker 4>and people that are all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really all there is in this </v>

1283
00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:40.831
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're also paying for the sins of a lot </v>

1284
00:57:40.831 --> 00:57:40.831
<v Speaker 4>of other people for centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

1285
00:57:40.831 --> 00:57:45.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>white American men dominated everything </v>

1286
00:57:45.110 --> 00:57:45.110
<v Speaker 4>in this country and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1287
00:57:45.110 --> 00:57:49.651
<v Speaker 4>there's also a reality of a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people were treated like garbage for a </v>

1288
00:57:49.651 --> 00:57:54.241
<v Speaker 4>long time and a lot of promises were </v>
<v Speaker 4>broken and there's a reality to that </v>

1289
00:57:54.241 --> 00:57:54.700
<v Speaker 4>that's not excuse making,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

1290
00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:58.270
<v Speaker 4>it's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they say,</v>

1291
00:57:58.271 --> 00:57:59.260
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1292
00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:01.540
<v Speaker 4>white people have benefited from that </v>
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>

1293
00:58:01.541 --> 00:58:01.710
<v Speaker 4>Even.</v>

1294
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:05.800
<v Speaker 4>So what's happening is in an effort to </v>
<v Speaker 4>balance the playing field a little bit,</v>

1295
00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:11.160
<v Speaker 4>a lot of us today are being treated </v>
<v Speaker 4>unfairly because the balancing act is </v>

1296
00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:12.670
<v Speaker 4>making things go so far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like I do understand that.</v>

1297
00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:16.720
<v Speaker 4>That's why I had a conversation after a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tosh is uh,</v>

1298
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:18.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and who did they get,</v>

1299
00:58:18.451 --> 00:58:19.930
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tracy's gay jokes.</v>

1300
00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:25.220
<v Speaker 4>And I had to come from folks that don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know Tracy Morgan did a joke about if </v>

1301
00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:25.990
<v Speaker 4>his son was gay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would stab them.</v>

1302
00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.230
<v Speaker 4>And everybody went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had a couple of gay comics on Rick</v>

1303
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:31.660
<v Speaker 4>Chrome and Jim David and we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 4>this on this comedy special.</v>

1304
00:58:31.661 --> 00:58:32.860
<v Speaker 4>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1305
00:58:32.861 --> 00:58:37.861
<v Speaker 4>the as Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked them how do they feel about the </v>

1306
00:58:37.861 --> 00:58:40.171
<v Speaker 4>imbalance in the language,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the fact that you get in trouble </v>

1307
00:58:40.171 --> 00:58:40.171
<v Speaker 4>for that now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Jim David said,</v>

1308
00:58:40.171 --> 00:58:41.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm okay with it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1309
00:58:41.531 --> 00:58:42.910
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how are you okay with it as a comic?</v>

1310
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:44.560
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's not a level playing field,</v>

1311
00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.110
<v Speaker 4>meaning what he thought was like in </v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

1312
00:58:47.111 --> 00:58:50.020
<v Speaker 4>gay people had not treated as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he didn't give a shit if,</v>

1313
00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:53.290
<v Speaker 4>if that guy got in a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 4>trouble and I kind of,</v>

1314
00:58:53.291 --> 00:58:54.570
<v Speaker 4>I heard what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

1315
00:58:54.610 --> 00:58:56.200
<v Speaker 4>even though I don't want to get in </v>
<v Speaker 4>trouble for it,</v>

1316
00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:58.180
<v Speaker 4>in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was right.</v>

1317
00:58:58.181 --> 00:58:59.590
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1318
00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:05.310
<v Speaker 4>we still have a big segment of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>country that can't get married and </v>

1319
00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:05.320
<v Speaker 4>they're treated like second class </v>
<v Speaker 4>citizens,</v>

1320
00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:07.930
<v Speaker 4>but yet we go around and tell other </v>
<v Speaker 4>countries had to live their lives.</v>

1321
00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.210
<v Speaker 4>Which soulfully shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes me nuts.</v>

1322
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:15.360
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's a real legitimate </v>

1323
00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:17.491
<v Speaker 4>argument in the idea that until it </v>
<v Speaker 4>balances out,</v>

1324
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 4>until everyone completely relaxes on </v>
<v Speaker 4>discrimination</v>

1325
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.940
<v Speaker 1>towards gays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1326
00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:25.820
<v Speaker 1>like there's no discrimination on </v>
<v Speaker 1>bachelors anymore,</v>

1327
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:28.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like of a man as a 50 year old man,</v>

1328
00:59:28.371 --> 00:59:29.780
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not getting married again.</v>

1329
00:59:29.781 --> 00:59:32.750
<v Speaker 1>There no discrimination or social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a social pariah,</v>

1330
00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:36.290
<v Speaker 1>but if he decides to marry a man than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>

1331
00:59:36.291 --> 00:59:36.830
<v Speaker 1>well what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1332
00:59:36.831 --> 00:59:40.040
<v Speaker 1>what is that and why is that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>eradicated from our culture yet?</v>

1333
00:59:40.041 --> 00:59:45.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once that is eradicated from our </v>

1334
00:59:45.041 --> 00:59:45.041
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think people are going to be much</v>

1335
00:59:45.041 --> 00:59:47.850
<v Speaker 1>more likely to accept gay jokes much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more like.</v>

1336
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:50.990
<v Speaker 1>Because I keep hearing that gay jokes or</v>
<v Speaker 1>homophobic and I'm like,</v>

1337
00:59:50.991 --> 00:59:51.620
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1338
00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:53.600
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not homophobic at all.</v>

1339
00:59:53.601 --> 00:59:58.601
<v Speaker 1>It's a gay joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like jokes about straight sex </v>

1340
00:59:58.601 --> 01:00:00.630
<v Speaker 1>aren't heterophobia alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're jokes about sex and there's,</v>

1341
01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.520
<v Speaker 1>there's jokes about everything and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really about context.</v>

1342
01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:09.521
<v Speaker 1>It's not about the subject matter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't eliminate certain subject </v>

1343
01:00:09.521 --> 01:00:09.521
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

1344
01:00:09.521 --> 01:00:12.320
<v Speaker 1>You just can't because the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is very nuance.</v>

1345
01:00:12.321 --> 01:00:17.321
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit going on and every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single interaction that you have we're </v>

1346
01:00:17.321 --> 01:00:21.460
<v Speaker 1>humor could potentially be crafted from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be taken into a whole wide </v>

1347
01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:24.140
<v Speaker 1>variety of different ways and I like all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those ways.</v>

1348
01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:26.840
<v Speaker 1>I like people saying fucked up shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really mean.</v>

1349
01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:30.780
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something funny and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tracy Morgan saying if a funnel,</v>

1350
01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:34.670
<v Speaker 1>most of them with girls I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's ridiculous.</v>

1351
01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>It's ludicrous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1352
01:00:36.321 --> 01:00:38.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course he wouldn't do that.</v>

1353
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Of course it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1354
01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.050
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous.</v>

1355
01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>The idea that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a joke in my Mac,</v>

1356
01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.640
<v Speaker 1>like guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny cash didn't really shoot a man in</v>

1357
01:00:46.641 --> 01:00:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Reno just to watch them die either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's,</v>

1358
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might be more likely that he did it.</v>

1359
01:00:52.221 --> 01:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Then Tracy Morgan would stab his son.</v>

1360
01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Stupid Johnny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny.</v>

1361
01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Johnny cash probably should have said I </v>
<v Speaker 1>took some pills and fell asleep on the </v>

1362
01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:00.880
<v Speaker 1>tour bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be more accurate,</v>

1363
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:03.560
<v Speaker 1>but I get what we're gay people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from too though,</v>

1364
01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:07.340
<v Speaker 1>because it's not a level playing field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you see like all this,</v>

1365
01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:10.310
<v Speaker 1>like it's almost like shitting on people</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're down.</v>

1366
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a perfect example,</v>

1367
01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.290
<v Speaker 1>like um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1368
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:16.430
<v Speaker 1>this opioid thing that's going on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1369
01:01:16.431 --> 01:01:21.431
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know ob many years ago </v>

1370
01:01:21.431 --> 01:01:24.370
<v Speaker 1>stomped on his homeless guys cake and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it would be cute to put it </v>

1371
01:01:24.370 --> 01:01:27.830
<v Speaker 1>online and people are so fucking mad at </v>
<v Speaker 1>them because it's a really douchey thing</v>

1372
01:01:27.831 --> 01:01:29.390
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been online for years though.</v>

1373
01:01:29.391 --> 01:01:32.300
<v Speaker 1>He just retweeted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's two for seven years.</v>

1374
01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.510
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that he will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people didn't like,</v>

1375
01:01:35.511 --> 01:01:40.511
<v Speaker 1>his people have a sense of humanity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they look at this guy and he's a </v>

1376
01:01:40.511 --> 01:01:40.511
<v Speaker 1>homeless guy.</v>

1377
01:01:40.511 --> 01:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking down and out and here's </v>
<v Speaker 1>this millionaire radio dj who thinks </v>

1378
01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>it's funny to stomp on his cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1379
01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:47.120
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that context.</v>

1380
01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:52.121
<v Speaker 1>Like I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that unfortunately </v>

1381
01:01:52.121 --> 01:01:52.121
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what would,</v>

1382
01:01:52.121 --> 01:01:53.060
<v Speaker 1>how we would do a walk over from Iraq </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday,</v>

1383
01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:55.340
<v Speaker 1>which you did with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that guy was,</v>

1384
01:01:55.341 --> 01:01:57.950
<v Speaker 1>that was Andrew and he was the guy we </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw everyday.</v>

1385
01:01:58.310 --> 01:02:00.530
<v Speaker 1>He was a guy we talked to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had on the air,</v>

1386
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:02.870
<v Speaker 1>we gave money to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would give them food,</v>

1387
01:02:02.871 --> 01:02:05.210
<v Speaker 1>like we had a really good relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this guy.</v>

1388
01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:10.420
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why he was offering cake </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we had stopped by so many times </v>

1389
01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>and handed him food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had some cake and open a dick thing,</v>

1390
01:02:12.591 --> 01:02:17.591
<v Speaker 1>but it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was literally just to make everybody </v>

1391
01:02:17.591 --> 01:02:20.621
<v Speaker 1>laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't to dehumanize this guy or to </v>

1392
01:02:20.621 --> 01:02:20.621
<v Speaker 1>degrade</v>

1393
01:02:20.621 --> 01:02:25.250
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was something he would have done to </v>

1394
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:25.510
<v Speaker 4>anybody else that he knew and I know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that that made people go well too,</v>

1395
01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:29.430
<v Speaker 4>but the reality was the context of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with Andrew,</v>

1396
01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:32.400
<v Speaker 4>the homeless guy was not some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey bomb,</v>

1397
01:02:32.401 --> 01:02:34.560
<v Speaker 4>here's some money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can do what we want.</v>

1398
01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:37.660
<v Speaker 4>It didn't feel like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't come off like that one.</v>

1399
01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.000
<v Speaker 4>I really depressed after stomped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just started drinking again too.</v>

1400
01:02:41.001 --> 01:02:43.620
<v Speaker 4>We were trying to get him sober and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good way to do it.</v>

1401
01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:45.170
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1402
01:02:45.171 --> 01:02:46.440
<v Speaker 4>there's a piece of shit cake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

1403
01:02:46.441 --> 01:02:51.441
<v Speaker 4>it was a fucking garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see you're supporting oprah and I'm </v>

1404
01:02:51.441 --> 01:02:55.641
<v Speaker 4>friends with too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm supporting opiod only because I was </v>

1405
01:02:55.641 --> 01:02:57.630
<v Speaker 4>there through that entire walk over with</v>
<v Speaker 4>Andrew and I saw him 50 times before and</v>

1406
01:02:57.631 --> 01:02:59.340
<v Speaker 4>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in context,</v>

1407
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:01.230
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have been fucking.</v>

1408
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.150
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was cringy and I was like,</v>

1409
01:03:03.151 --> 01:03:04.290
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

1410
01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:09.560
<v Speaker 4>Did he give him anything after he </v>
<v Speaker 4>stumped on this cake to give them any </v>

1411
01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:09.560
<v Speaker 4>money?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course he did.</v>

1412
01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:09.560
<v Speaker 4>We gave him anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1413
01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm like $100 and then people will </v>
<v Speaker 4>going.</v>

1414
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:12.870
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like this is what I'm saying.</v>

1415
01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:13.440
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1416
01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:15.240
<v Speaker 4>you could to humanize them and give him </v>
<v Speaker 4>100 bucks.</v>

1417
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:18.900
<v Speaker 4>But it wasn't looked at like nobody felt</v>
<v Speaker 4>like wow,</v>

1418
01:03:18.901 --> 01:03:23.901
<v Speaker 4>he dehumanized this guy because he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody we talked to all the time and </v>

1419
01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:27.561
<v Speaker 4>had great interactions with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's why it didn't feel like I </v>

1420
01:03:27.561 --> 01:03:30.150
<v Speaker 4>understand people seeing it though and </v>
<v Speaker 4>going home like the fuck is going on you</v>

1421
01:03:30.151 --> 01:03:35.151
<v Speaker 4>piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I get seeing a one and a half </v>

1422
01:03:35.151 --> 01:03:38.540
<v Speaker 4>minute clip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I would feel the same way if I </v>

1423
01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:39.630
<v Speaker 4>didn't have the luxury of having been </v>
<v Speaker 4>there throughout that entire time.</v>

1424
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:42.120
<v Speaker 4>We'll what we see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's a perfect example.</v>

1425
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:47.180
<v Speaker 4>If if that homeless guy was getting in </v>
<v Speaker 4>an argument with another homeless guy </v>

1426
01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:51.831
<v Speaker 4>and the homeless guy jumped on his cake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it would be okay because there's </v>

1427
01:03:51.831 --> 01:03:53.820
<v Speaker 4>one homeless guy getting over on another</v>
<v Speaker 4>homeless guy and stomp on kick,</v>

1428
01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:56.850
<v Speaker 4>but when a millionaire guy does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1429
01:03:56.851 --> 01:04:01.380
<v Speaker 4>I know what he was doing and I know what</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that audience is like when you're.</v>

1430
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:06.440
<v Speaker 4>When you guys are opie and Anthony is my</v>
<v Speaker 4>favorite show ever to do because it's </v>

1431
01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.911
<v Speaker 4>such a hang and everybody's making </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody else laugh and it's like what </v>

1432
01:04:10.911 --> 01:04:12.030
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about before the show </v>
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

1433
01:04:12.031 --> 01:04:17.031
<v Speaker 4>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's okay for you and I to talk about </v>

1434
01:04:17.031 --> 01:04:21.531
<v Speaker 4>in our jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I stand up comedians for most </v>

1435
01:04:21.531 --> 01:04:22.470
<v Speaker 4>people that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that those same words and thoughts would</v>

1436
01:04:22.471 --> 01:04:24.870
<v Speaker 4>get you fired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will get you kicked out of the office.</v>

1437
01:04:24.871 --> 01:04:26.700
<v Speaker 4>You get written up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get sued.</v>

1438
01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:30.810
<v Speaker 4>You can't have that sort of mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But for us it's so normal.</v>

1439
01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:35.900
<v Speaker 4>So when you're hanging out with opie and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anthony [inaudible] and you guys are </v>

1440
01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:39.951
<v Speaker 4>just talking mad shit and you're on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>air as you're walking across the street </v>

1441
01:04:39.951 --> 01:04:40.650
<v Speaker 4>and you're just trying to make each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other laugh.</v>

1442
01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:45.800
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that people do </v>
<v Speaker 4>when they try to make each other laugh </v>

1443
01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.330
<v Speaker 4>is it crossed the line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're completely brutally crossed the </v>

1444
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:49.710
<v Speaker 4>line and that's the way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're brutally crossed the line.</v>

1445
01:04:49.711 --> 01:04:53.490
<v Speaker 4>You've got to jump on the homeless guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cake and Opie in doing that,</v>

1446
01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:57.810
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like a cop out on my part </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's my friend and I would never</v>

1447
01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:00.960
<v Speaker 4>have done what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know what his motivation was.</v>

1448
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:03.600
<v Speaker 4>It was exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And your audience will accept a lot,</v>

1449
01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.510
<v Speaker 4>but honestly there is a humanity to </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1450
01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:08.310
<v Speaker 4>Like that homeless shopping spree we </v>
<v Speaker 4>would do.</v>

1451
01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.390
<v Speaker 4>The homeless guys would never mistreat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they were treated like rock stars.</v>

1452
01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:17.660
<v Speaker 4>They would go to the mall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of people would be cheering </v>

1453
01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:17.860
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>buying them shit with their people.</v>

1454
01:05:17.861 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 4>We had</v>

1455
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:19.830
<v Speaker 5>gotten to know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was like the people who mentioned,</v>

1456
01:05:19.831 --> 01:05:21.190
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they would do the homeless shopping</v>

1457
01:05:21.191 --> 01:05:22.960
<v Speaker 5>spree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like they weren't.</v>

1458
01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:25.930
<v Speaker 5>It didn't feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1459
01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.500
<v Speaker 5>it felt like a fucked up thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it didn't feel as literal as,</v>

1460
01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:34.740
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a millionaire stepping on the food </v>

1461
01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:37.921
<v Speaker 5>of a homeless man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I don't think that was the </v>

1462
01:05:37.921 --> 01:05:38.880
<v Speaker 5>intent behind it other than just being a</v>
<v Speaker 5>dick in that moment to a guy who he knew</v>

1463
01:05:38.881 --> 01:05:41.370
<v Speaker 5>we had given food money to and we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to give money to the.</v>

1464
01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:42.940
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know what you're saying.</v>

1465
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:45.730
<v Speaker 5>I know it was just a momentary dick </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing to do.</v>

1466
01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:50.440
<v Speaker 5>And he did it in the sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's silly not to humiliate Andrew.</v>

1467
01:05:50.441 --> 01:05:55.441
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wanted to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is when you see things out </v>

1468
01:05:55.441 --> 01:05:55.441
<v Speaker 5>of context,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like you were talking about earlier</v>

1469
01:05:55.441 --> 01:06:00.031
<v Speaker 5>about Paula Dean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know the entirety of a person </v>

1470
01:06:00.031 --> 01:06:01.180
<v Speaker 5>when you see one event is a great guy.</v>

1471
01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.950
<v Speaker 5>We had him on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a great guy.</v>

1472
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.270
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1473
01:06:04.271 --> 01:06:06.880
<v Speaker 5>I always credit you guys with being the </v>
<v Speaker 5>reasons.</v>

1474
01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:09.640
<v Speaker 5>One of the reasons why I wanted her to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get into podcasting in the first place,</v>

1475
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:12.850
<v Speaker 5>it was because of doing your show </v>
<v Speaker 5>because your show was the only show that</v>

1476
01:06:12.851 --> 01:06:17.851
<v Speaker 5>I had ever done where it was just no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was no like rigid set of like,</v>

1477
01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:22.950
<v Speaker 5>this is this now and then we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>go to the wacky five at five and then </v>

1478
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:23.620
<v Speaker 5>there's bomb on the chopper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was nothing.</v>

1479
01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.870
<v Speaker 5>It was a hang.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a complete total hang.</v>

1480
01:06:25.871 --> 01:06:28.570
<v Speaker 5>Every time I've ever done it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's with [inaudible] or with.</v>

1481
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.630
<v Speaker 5>I mean fucking how many times have I </v>
<v Speaker 5>done it?</v>

1482
01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:35.440
<v Speaker 5>I've done it so many times with so many </v>
<v Speaker 5>different comics with rich or with never</v>

1483
01:06:35.441 --> 01:06:40.441
<v Speaker 5>cut a deal with patrice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only thing I did with Patrice was </v>

1484
01:06:40.441 --> 01:06:40.441
<v Speaker 5>when we did that thing in vegas </v>
<v Speaker 5>together,</v>

1485
01:06:40.441 --> 01:06:40.441
<v Speaker 5>which was a lot of.</v>

1486
01:06:40.441 --> 01:06:41.560
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1487
01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:43.840
<v Speaker 5>that's all I got to hang with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Patrice is the only time I really got to</v>

1488
01:06:43.841 --> 01:06:48.841
<v Speaker 5>hang with them outside of like seeing </v>
<v Speaker 5>them early on in the day when I didn't </v>

1489
01:06:48.841 --> 01:06:53.041
<v Speaker 5>even know him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was one of my favorite people even </v>

1490
01:06:53.041 --> 01:06:55.921
<v Speaker 5>though he was very dominating and with </v>
<v Speaker 5>no one could out Yap and Patrice </v>

1491
01:06:55.921 --> 01:06:58.921
<v Speaker 5>loudness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was so much fun to do radio with </v>

1492
01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:03.970
<v Speaker 5>like he was one of my favorite guys ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>because to make him like if you made him</v>

1493
01:07:03.971 --> 01:07:05.800
<v Speaker 5>laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1494
01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:10.830
<v Speaker 5>you knew you were funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't give it to people for no </v>

1495
01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:14.910
<v Speaker 5>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't get pity bullshit fee and he </v>

1496
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:16.060
<v Speaker 5>was just too unconcerned with hurting </v>
<v Speaker 5>people's feelings to do that.</v>

1497
01:07:16.061 --> 01:07:18.010
<v Speaker 5>He didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1498
01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:23.140
<v Speaker 5>and one of my favorite things with him </v>
<v Speaker 5>as I convinced him that face officers </v>

1499
01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.730
<v Speaker 5>shitty movie and that's one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of my favorite moment.</v>

1500
01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:28.130
<v Speaker 5>It happened to k rock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was John Travolta and Nick K,</v>

1501
01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:30.640
<v Speaker 5>Nick Cage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who he was arguing he loved that.</v>

1502
01:07:30.641 --> 01:07:33.610
<v Speaker 5>He loved it and I fucking convinced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was a fun,</v>

1503
01:07:33.611 --> 01:07:35.760
<v Speaker 5>friendly to watch him go like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

1504
01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:37.570
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like to see him.</v>

1505
01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:42.340
<v Speaker 5>He made me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was one of my favorite moments of all</v>

1506
01:07:42.341 --> 01:07:44.110
<v Speaker 5>time in that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just to see this,</v>

1507
01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.320
<v Speaker 5>this because he was such a giant of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy intellectually,</v>

1508
01:07:47.321 --> 01:07:50.280
<v Speaker 5>like the greatest mistake people could </v>
<v Speaker 5>make with patrice fifth to think,</v>

1509
01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:51.520
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a big black guy.</v>

1510
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
<v Speaker 5>Patrice was a brilliant motherfucker and</v>
<v Speaker 5>could outtalk almost anybody and could </v>

1511
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.200
<v Speaker 5>out logic almost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when you,</v>

1512
01:07:59.201 --> 01:08:01.090
<v Speaker 5>when you had moments like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was friendly,</v>

1513
01:08:01.091 --> 01:08:02.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't like an aggressive argument.</v>

1514
01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:03.760
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

1515
01:08:03.761 --> 01:08:06.310
<v Speaker 5>that just was one of the most satisfying</v>
<v Speaker 5>moments in my career.</v>

1516
01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:07.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1517
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:12.150
<v Speaker 5>it's the opportunity to be around fun </v>
<v Speaker 5>people like that rare human beings that </v>

1518
01:08:12.701 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 5>you don't necessarily come across and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a regular job.</v>

1519
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:18.500
<v Speaker 4>If you're working as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an insurance salesman.</v>

1520
01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:21.740
<v Speaker 4>How many patrice o'neal's do you come </v>
<v Speaker 4>across in your life that you get to hang</v>

1521

<v Speaker 4>out with?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just by calling so late on their </v>

1522
01:08:26.741 --> 01:08:26.741
<v Speaker 4>payments?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quite,</v>

1523
01:08:26.741 --> 01:08:27.530
<v Speaker 4>quite a few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think one more thing,</v>

1524
01:08:27.531 --> 01:08:28.310
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before I forget,</v>

1525
01:08:28.311 --> 01:08:30.010
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to say about ob to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1526
01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:31.460
<v Speaker 4>about homeless is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1527
01:08:31.461 --> 01:08:32.750
<v Speaker 4>he's the one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not that it matters,</v>

1528
01:08:32.751 --> 01:08:37.751
<v Speaker 4>but he's the guy that pushed homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mustered through the Daniel Mustard and </v>

1529
01:08:37.751 --> 01:08:42.161
<v Speaker 4>a and tried to get a recording contract </v>
<v Speaker 4>and like really try to take care of the </v>

1530
01:08:42.161 --> 01:08:42.161
<v Speaker 4>guy that's the guy singing that song </v>
<v Speaker 4>creep,</v>

1531
01:08:42.161 --> 01:08:43.610
<v Speaker 4>creep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really talented,</v>

1532
01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:48.940
<v Speaker 4>talented,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like an opie took a real </v>

1533
01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:48.940
<v Speaker 4>concern with him in his sobriety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

1534
01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:50.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying people don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not trying to say don't be mad,</v>

1535
01:08:50.481 --> 01:08:52.010
<v Speaker 4>be mad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>

1536
01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:57.280
<v Speaker 4>don't think you understand the totality </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a guy because he did one silly thing </v>

1537
01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.400
<v Speaker 4>in a different context to make his radio</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

1538
01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.580
<v Speaker 4>And some fans laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're so good at breaking shit down.</v>

1539
01:09:01.581 --> 01:09:02.660
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

1540
01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:05.930
<v Speaker 4>you said that there was not a hint of </v>
<v Speaker 4>bias there.</v>

1541
01:09:05.931 --> 01:09:07.610
<v Speaker 4>You were being completely honest about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1542
01:09:07.611 --> 01:09:10.730
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really value that in the way you talk.</v>

1543
01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:15.820
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I was really happy when I</v>
<v Speaker 4>watched that Kamau bell show will come </v>

1544
01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:21.790
<v Speaker 4>out about I totally biased command,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was web model w Kamau Bell,</v>

1545
01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:27.460
<v Speaker 4>you and Lindy West,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lindy West who's a,</v>

1546
01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:32.180
<v Speaker 4>a feminist blogger for a Jezza bell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a feminist website.</v>

1547
01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.370
<v Speaker 4>And what I loved about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man was first of all,</v>

1548
01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:39.371
<v Speaker 4>you never got upset you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were rational and logical and you </v>

1549
01:09:39.371 --> 01:09:44.081
<v Speaker 4>had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about it in a very </v>

1550
01:09:44.081 --> 01:09:46.871
<v Speaker 4>measured way and you're being really </v>
<v Speaker 4>friendly while you were discussing this </v>

1551
01:09:46.871 --> 01:09:47.990
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in her,</v>

1552
01:09:48.370 --> 01:09:52.040
<v Speaker 4>in her defense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very tricky subject to breach for</v>

1553
01:09:52.041 --> 01:09:57.041
<v Speaker 4>a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she was saying a lot of shit like </v>

1554
01:09:57.041 --> 01:09:57.560
<v Speaker 4>comedy clubs are filled with rooms </v>
<v Speaker 4>filled with angry men.</v>

1555
01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.450
<v Speaker 4>And you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you didn't even flinch.</v>

1556
01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.580
<v Speaker 4>He didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't go after her,</v>

1557
01:10:01.581 --> 01:10:04.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like she had like these digs about like,</v>

1558
01:10:04.221 --> 01:10:05.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're allowed to just joke about it,</v>

1559
01:10:05.811 --> 01:10:07.280
<v Speaker 4>but I'm allowed to tell you you're a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dick.</v>

1560
01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:09.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get personally could.</v>

1561
01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:10.280
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think she liked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She hadn't.</v>

1562
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:12.830
<v Speaker 4>The blog wasn't about me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was about a guy who,</v>

1563
01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:16.360
<v Speaker 4>one guy making a Dick joke or certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>rape jokes that put,</v>

1564
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:17.870
<v Speaker 4>and this is the tricky part of Lindy </v>
<v Speaker 4>West,</v>

1565
01:10:17.871 --> 01:10:20.240
<v Speaker 4>he's a lot of people would say she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>against she's presenting ship,</v>

1566
01:10:20.241 --> 01:10:22.520
<v Speaker 4>but she really wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was about.</v>

1567
01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:27.730
<v Speaker 4>She didn't like the jokes that she </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought minimalize the victim in a rape </v>

1568
01:10:27.730 --> 01:10:28.370
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to logically say,</v>

1569
01:10:28.371 --> 01:10:28.970
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1570
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.680
<v Speaker 4>minimalizing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the victim of rape is a good thing,</v>

1571
01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:34.190
<v Speaker 4>but what people forget,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they went after Sam morale.</v>

1572
01:10:34.191 --> 01:10:35.540
<v Speaker 4>A lot of jokes or just Mrs.</v>

1573
01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:41.140
<v Speaker 4>He's a comedian in New York who had done</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like domestic violence jokes </v>

1574
01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:44.801
<v Speaker 4>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in a misdirection joke you you go </v>

1575
01:10:44.801 --> 01:10:48.230
<v Speaker 4>for the most obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're opposite thing,</v>

1576
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:52.850
<v Speaker 4>so sometimes it is a violent sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I did one joke and this didn't come</v>

1577
01:10:52.851 --> 01:10:55.820
<v Speaker 4>up in that show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I was talking about seeing it a</v>

1578
01:10:55.821 --> 01:10:59.330
<v Speaker 4>girl now I don't know if she had a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>time what was raped at a Porta potty.</v>

1579
01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to go through the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>joke before,</v>

1580
01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.380
<v Speaker 4>but those were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was at a concert and outdoor concert.</v>

1581
01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:08.680
<v Speaker 4>So the two most opposite things I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>think of if I said I didn't know if she </v>

1582
01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.220
<v Speaker 4>had a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not a very good time.</v>

1583
01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.480
<v Speaker 4>Who gives a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

1584
01:11:11.481 --> 01:11:13.500
<v Speaker 4>You raped in a Porta potty.</v>

1585
01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:19.300
<v Speaker 5>Painting a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I said I didn't know if she was </v>

1586
01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:19.300
<v Speaker 5>beaten in Porta potty or raped in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>Porta potty,</v>

1587
01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:20.130
<v Speaker 5>nobody would've laughed because they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>too close.</v>

1588
01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.320
<v Speaker 5>So the fact I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm explaining this to the audience,</v>

1589
01:11:22.321 --> 01:11:25.740
<v Speaker 5>not just the fact that you take two </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that are such polar opposites.</v>

1590
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:30.980
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes the polar opposite you land on</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the joke is a horrible thing that </v>

1591
01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:35.391
<v Speaker 5>minimalizes the victim and every </v>
<v Speaker 5>Catholic priests joke is somehow </v>

1592
01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:39.351
<v Speaker 5>minimalizing the victim part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Comedy does that and I don't believe </v>

1593
01:11:39.351 --> 01:11:40.680
<v Speaker 5>that it has to just be speaking truth to</v>
<v Speaker 5>power.</v>

1594
01:11:40.681 --> 01:11:45.681
<v Speaker 5>I think that's part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think that as long as your </v>

1595
01:11:45.681 --> 01:11:48.000
<v Speaker 5>intention is genuinely to be funny and </v>
<v Speaker 5>not to humiliate a person for real,</v>

1596
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:53.750
<v Speaker 5>I think it's allowable and it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it gets to be too subjective </v>

1597
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.750
<v Speaker 5>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1598
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:55.650
<v Speaker 5>it's an art form and if you don't like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that art form,</v>

1599
01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:00.680
<v Speaker 5>I completely and totally understand that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to participate to </v>

1600
01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:00.680
<v Speaker 5>participate in the shelves.</v>

1601
01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.260
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you're,</v>

1602
01:12:02.261 --> 01:12:05.910
<v Speaker 5>you're being hypercritical about and </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to get people to stop doing it,</v>

1603
01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:09.270
<v Speaker 5>you're going to make it so that that art</v>
<v Speaker 5>form is not available.</v>

1604
01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:13.770
<v Speaker 5>Like the really fucked up thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't mean art form is not available.</v>

1605
01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.450
<v Speaker 5>Just like rap music.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1606
01:12:15.451 --> 01:12:18.600
<v Speaker 5>what is going on in rap music or they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>really running around killing people and</v>

1607
01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:20.300
<v Speaker 5>selling cocaine every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1608
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:22.830
<v Speaker 5>most of what they're doing is talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit about something.</v>

1609
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:25.290
<v Speaker 5>It's no different than the movie </v>
<v Speaker 5>scarface.</v>

1610
01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:27.500
<v Speaker 5>Nobody really died in that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1611
01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:29.130
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're painting a picture.</v>

1612
01:12:29.131 --> 01:12:31.020
<v Speaker 5>It's a gross,</v>
<v Speaker 5>horrific picture,</v>

1613
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:34.470
<v Speaker 5>but some people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They liked to watch scarface,</v>

1614
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:39.560
<v Speaker 5>that liked to listen to rap music.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want to hear a dirty comic say </v>

1615
01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.800
<v Speaker 5>horrendous inappropriate things that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked up.</v>

1616
01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:43.830
<v Speaker 5>One of my favorites is Otto,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Otto and George.</v>

1617
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:46.590
<v Speaker 5>He would say some of the most fucked up.</v>

1618
01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:51.590
<v Speaker 5>Ridiculous over the top shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the reason why I did it is because </v>

1619
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:55.190
<v Speaker 5>that's like what shocks us shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>you and makes you laugh when you least </v>

1620
01:12:55.190 --> 01:12:55.190
<v Speaker 5>expect it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was like,</v>

1621
01:12:55.190 --> 01:12:57.300
<v Speaker 5>well crafted in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on top of that.</v>

1622
01:12:57.330 --> 01:12:59.850
<v Speaker 5>He made me laugh harder than anybody's </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever made me laugh in a club.</v>

1623
01:12:59.851 --> 01:13:02.520
<v Speaker 5>We were doing a pizzeria in Pennsylvania</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he said something.</v>

1624
01:13:02.521 --> 01:13:05.310
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was barbarism and it made me,</v>

1625
01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:08.100
<v Speaker 5>it was because of the imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was such,</v>

1626
01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:08.850
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

1627
01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:12.210
<v Speaker 5>it was such poetry that he flew off the </v>
<v Speaker 5>top with that.</v>

1628
01:13:12.211 --> 01:13:14.620
<v Speaker 5>It was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1629
01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.750
<v Speaker 5>I've ever told you this story and it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1630
01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:18.870
<v Speaker 5>it won't hold,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if I say it now,</v>

1631
01:13:18.871 --> 01:13:20.850
<v Speaker 5>it's not gonna be the greatest jokey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the beauty of it,</v>

1632
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:23.040
<v Speaker 5>we were in a pizzeria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was an awful gig.</v>

1633
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.500
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

1634
01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:26.570
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1635
01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.400
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're like real pizzeria bench seats.</v>

1636
01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.570
<v Speaker 5>It stunk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1637
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:33.240
<v Speaker 5>there was a bar next to it and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>watching it.</v>

1638
01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:36.120
<v Speaker 5>It was just up there fucking struggling </v>
<v Speaker 5>and hitting it.</v>

1639
01:13:36.690 --> 01:13:41.690
<v Speaker 5>And in the middle of this dirty act,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bookers girlfriend walks down the </v>

1640
01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:45.051
<v Speaker 5>aisle with her seven year old son,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was so inappropriate.</v>

1641
01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:48.210
<v Speaker 5>And everybody looked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just derails the show.</v>

1642
01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:50.330
<v Speaker 5>And Auto,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1643
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:51.630
<v Speaker 5>just said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1644
01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:55.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because everyone looked at the fucking,</v>

1645
01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:58.660
<v Speaker 5>the puppet addressed it and said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1646
01:13:58.850 --> 01:14:01.140
<v Speaker 5>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't that cute.</v>

1647
01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:05.340
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to grab him by the ankles and </v>
<v Speaker 5>smashes Scotland to a fucking sink.</v>

1648
01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:09.330
<v Speaker 5>And it was a caligula reference to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>end of Caligula.</v>

1649
01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.980
<v Speaker 5>And it made me the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1650
01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:11.830
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the</v>

1651
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.710
<v Speaker 4>speed at which he put those words </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

1652
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:15.440
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1653
01:14:15.441 --> 01:14:18.300
<v Speaker 4>the violence attached to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1654
01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:23.320
<v Speaker 4>and the imagery of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never laughed harder than anything </v>

1655
01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:23.830
<v Speaker 4>anybody's ever said in a comedy club </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I knew what had just happened is</v>

1656
01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:29.190
<v Speaker 4>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I immediately saw the end of Caligula </v>

1657
01:14:29.190 --> 01:14:29.980
<v Speaker 4>where they grabbed the ankles and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>smash the fucking head into the steps.</v>

1658
01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:35.220
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the genius to pull that out in this </v>

1659
01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:35.220
<v Speaker 4>moment and word it that quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

1660
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:36.100
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1661
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.960
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was beauty.</v>

1662
01:14:37.961 --> 01:14:40.820
<v Speaker 4>But it was a horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And nobody laughed.</v>

1663
01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:45.370
<v Speaker 4>Of course they didn't affiliate </v>
<v Speaker 4>pizzeria.</v>

1664
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:50.550
<v Speaker 4>Nobody understood how funny that was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had just said that and I hadn't seen </v>

1665
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:52.600
<v Speaker 4>Caligula.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might not have laughed as hard,</v>

1666
01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:55.450
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that I immediately saw what</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did with it,</v>

1667
01:14:55.451 --> 01:14:57.820
<v Speaker 4>I was just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to hug them for that.</v>

1668
01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:59.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you brilliant,</v>

1669
01:14:59.201 --> 01:15:01.000
<v Speaker 4>brilliant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a brilliant fuck man.</v>

1670
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:03.970
<v Speaker 4>He's a very funny guy and his style of </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy,</v>

1671
01:15:03.971 --> 01:15:08.971
<v Speaker 4>much like dyson style of comedy is </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous over the top things.</v>

1672
01:15:09.041 --> 01:15:14.041
<v Speaker 4>They don't really mean like dice has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>some bit about about how a woman gets </v>

1673
01:15:14.041 --> 01:15:16.810
<v Speaker 4>pregnant and it's one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>hilarious,</v>

1674
01:15:16.811 --> 01:15:21.811
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous bits because it goes into </v>
<v Speaker 4>like this medical or how you can make a </v>

1675
01:15:21.811 --> 01:15:25.951
<v Speaker 4>gay kid like how fucking so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous idiocy it's completed,</v>

1676
01:15:27.131 --> 01:15:30.970
<v Speaker 4>but it's hilarious and for people to say</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's a homophobic joke,</v>

1677
01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:33.610
<v Speaker 4>know he doesn't believe he doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>a word.</v>

1678
01:15:33.611 --> 01:15:35.650
<v Speaker 4>He's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you understand that this is.</v>

1679
01:15:35.651 --> 01:15:37.870
<v Speaker 4>This is like an art piece that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching.</v>

1680
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:41.650
<v Speaker 4>This is just a ridiculous over the top </v>
<v Speaker 4>art piece,</v>

1681
01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.820
<v Speaker 4>and for you to say that it's not viewed </v>
<v Speaker 4>to say that I shouldn't be enjoying it,</v>

1682
01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:50.970
<v Speaker 4>well then we have to go with a fine </v>
<v Speaker 4>tooth comb over virtually all of pop </v>

1683
01:15:50.970 --> 01:15:51.700
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every song.</v>

1684
01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:55.170
<v Speaker 4>We have to find out what the true </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning behind movies are,</v>

1685
01:15:55.210 --> 01:15:57.340
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the implication on society?</v>

1686
01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:00.020
<v Speaker 4>Because it can't just be humor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this.</v>

1687
01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:01.930
<v Speaker 4>It's a dumb way of looking at it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>

1688
01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:04.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a joke.</v>

1689
01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.820
<v Speaker 4>If it's a standup comedy show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1690
01:16:06.821 --> 01:16:10.210
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least in that sense.</v>

1691
01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.690
<v Speaker 4>There's no excuse with a rap music with </v>
<v Speaker 4>a rap song.</v>

1692
01:16:13.691 --> 01:16:14.020
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1693
01:16:14.021 --> 01:16:16.510
<v Speaker 4>it's not a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he's being serious with a movie.</v>

1694
01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:17.920
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they're trying to promote that </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifestyle.</v>

1695
01:16:17.921 --> 01:16:20.050
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a standup comedy show.</v>

1696
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:24.040
<v Speaker 4>The only reason why people are laughing </v>
<v Speaker 4>is because it's a joke.</v>

1697
01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:25.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people do know that,</v>

1698
01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:27.880
<v Speaker 4>but it's unfunny people attempting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>influence these people,</v>

1699
01:16:27.881 --> 01:16:31.240
<v Speaker 4>trying to influence what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the same mentality and I don't</v>

1700
01:16:31.241 --> 01:16:36.241
<v Speaker 4>mean individually like let's just say </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same mentality that would target </v>

1701
01:16:36.241 --> 01:16:37.570
<v Speaker 4>dice or that would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1702
01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:42.580
<v Speaker 4>you should get in trouble for a gay joke</v>
<v Speaker 4>are the exact same people who would </v>

1703
01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:46.651
<v Speaker 4>stand up and defend Maple Thorp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the same people who would defend </v>

1704
01:16:46.651 --> 01:16:50.671
<v Speaker 4>piss Christ and say that the national </v>
<v Speaker 4>endowment of the arts should have paid </v>

1705
01:16:50.671 --> 01:16:51.070
<v Speaker 4>for piss Christ because who tell people </v>
<v Speaker 4>what that is?</v>

1706
01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:51.500
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1707
01:16:51.501 --> 01:16:52.020
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1708
01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:57.030
<v Speaker 4>it's at the NDA and I think paid for it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was an artist who pissed into a jar and </v>

1709
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.490
<v Speaker 4>you put a crucifix in it and he called </v>
<v Speaker 4>it piss Christ.</v>

1710
01:16:57.910 --> 01:17:02.910
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that that's particularly </v>

1711
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:02.910
<v Speaker 4>clever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't offend me on any level.</v>

1712
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:04.740
<v Speaker 4>And here's more inconsistency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is the same people clever.</v>

1713
01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:05.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was,</v>

1714
01:17:05.351 --> 01:17:05.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1715
01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:07.580
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't mind if I wish I would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought of that.</v>

1716
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:08.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1717
01:17:08.171 --> 01:17:10.090
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't fill the jar with my pis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would've been</v>

1718
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.540
<v Speaker 1>like two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1719
01:17:11.541 --> 01:17:13.910
<v Speaker 1>I really wasn't a big jar too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very impressive.</v>

1720
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

1721
01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:15.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a two kegger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1722
01:17:15.861 --> 01:17:16.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he,</v>

1723
01:17:16.730 --> 01:17:21.730
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they support that and they're the same </v>

1724
01:17:21.730 --> 01:17:23.921
<v Speaker 1>people who would have attacked Giuliani </v>
<v Speaker 1>for going after the fucking Brooklyn </v>

1725
01:17:23.921 --> 01:17:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Museum of art because that Guy Pin </v>
<v Speaker 1>African artists painted,</v>

1726
01:17:25.690 --> 01:17:27.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Virgin Mary and Dung.</v>

1727
01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:30.260
<v Speaker 1>So they would call him a fascist for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1728
01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1729
01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.150
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1730
01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:37.210
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand the art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you attack Maple Thorp and you don't </v>

1731
01:17:37.210 --> 01:17:37.210
<v Speaker 1>understand art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you attack piss Christ.</v>

1732
01:17:37.210 --> 01:17:37.670
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you attack a common well,</v>

1733
01:17:37.671 --> 01:17:40.550
<v Speaker 1>that comic is insensitive and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying something racially,</v>

1734
01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:42.620
<v Speaker 1>racially insensitive or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or gender intensive.</v>

1735
01:17:42.621 --> 01:17:44.540
<v Speaker 1>And it shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's inconsistency.</v>

1736
01:17:44.541 --> 01:17:47.750
<v Speaker 1>You can't fucking respect if you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge any of it with respect,</v>

1737
01:17:47.751 --> 01:17:50.900
<v Speaker 1>it's people have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to leave room for art.</v>

1738
01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:56.020
<v Speaker 1>And that sounds ridiculous when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about Dick Jokes or any kind of </v>

1739
01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:59.531
<v Speaker 1>jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to leave room for art </v>

1740
01:17:59.531 --> 01:17:59.531
<v Speaker 1>because that's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just an art.</v>

1741
01:17:59.531 --> 01:18:00.020
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't appreciate that style </v>
<v Speaker 1>of art,</v>

1742
01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:05.200
<v Speaker 1>it's no different than you deciding to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to a metallica show and not liking </v>

1743
01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:05.200
<v Speaker 1>the lyrics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1744
01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.290
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to like it.</v>

1745
01:18:06.450 --> 01:18:08.510
<v Speaker 1>There's jody Mitchell's planned down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>block,</v>

1746
01:18:08.511 --> 01:18:09.350
<v Speaker 1>go see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

1747
01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:14.351
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go see sheryl crow or go see Dave </v>

1748
01:18:14.351 --> 01:18:14.351
<v Speaker 1>Matthews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of variety out there,</v>

1749
01:18:14.351 --> 01:18:18.970
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that someone creates and </v>

1750
01:18:18.970 --> 01:18:18.970
<v Speaker 1>when Otto says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1751
01:18:18.970 --> 01:18:23.441
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to pick him up by his ankles </v>
<v Speaker 1>and slammed his head into a sink and </v>

1752
01:18:23.441 --> 01:18:26.651
<v Speaker 1>you're laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means he delivered art to the </v>

1753
01:18:26.651 --> 01:18:29.380
<v Speaker 1>person who likes that art and I feel the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way when I.</v>

1754
01:18:29.410 --> 01:18:30.470
<v Speaker 1>When I see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1755
01:18:30.471 --> 01:18:32.600
<v Speaker 1>when I saw dykes or when I saw you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Austin,</v>

1756
01:18:32.601 --> 01:18:36.740
<v Speaker 1>same feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy ridiculous over the top humor.</v>

1757
01:18:36.741 --> 01:18:39.530
<v Speaker 1>It's my one of my favorite things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

1758
01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:44.620
<v Speaker 1>So when someone comes along and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do jokes about violence </v>

1759
01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:45.440
<v Speaker 1>against children because it's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes you can.</v>

1760
01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

1761
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Even if your kid killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well unfortunately for you,</v>

1762
01:18:50.541 --> 01:18:52.790
<v Speaker 1>this one hit home and it's not fun to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1763
01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:57.880
<v Speaker 1>but everybody else doesn't have a kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was killed by slamming their head </v>

1764
01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:58.160
<v Speaker 1>into a sink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes fun for them and it sucks,</v>

1765
01:18:58.161 --> 01:19:02.600
<v Speaker 1>but you can't just stop the art form </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's going to hit you and that's</v>

1766
01:19:02.601 --> 01:19:05.750
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that came up in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with Lindy Lindy,</v>

1767
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Lindy West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lindy West,</v>

1768
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:12.430
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that came up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with her was that she was </v>

1769
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:16.211
<v Speaker 1>talking about rape jokes and meanwhile </v>
<v Speaker 1>she had a photo on her twitter of Jeff </v>

1770
01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Goldbloom who was in death wish with a n</v>
<v Speaker 1>w who enacted a really horrific rape </v>

1771
01:19:24.831 --> 01:19:26.300
<v Speaker 1>scene at barbera grape signo.</v>

1772
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Scary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>

1773
01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:30.020
<v Speaker 1>No joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no jokes involved.</v>

1774
01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:31.330
<v Speaker 1>There was no hee hee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ha ha,</v>

1775
01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:36.360
<v Speaker 1>no double entendres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet an actor doing that in that </v>

1776
01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:41.180
<v Speaker 1>piece of art somehow or another is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exonerated from the impact and this idea</v>

1777
01:19:41.181 --> 01:19:43.970
<v Speaker 1>that you should know that one third of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience.</v>

1778
01:19:43.971 --> 01:19:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I think the current thing they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoying banding about.</v>

1779
01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.880
<v Speaker 1>When people talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say they're enjoying,</v>

1780
01:19:49.881 --> 01:19:54.881
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to dismiss it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people who really believe this </v>

1781
01:19:54.881 --> 01:19:57.851
<v Speaker 1>believe that one third of all women have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been either sexually assaulted or raped </v>

1782
01:19:57.851 --> 01:20:01.991
<v Speaker 1>and there's people that dispute that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of it is based on a </v>

1783
01:20:01.991 --> 01:20:06.491
<v Speaker 1>certain study from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was 1987 and there was a </v>

1784
01:20:06.491 --> 01:20:08.310
<v Speaker 1>lot of questions that are very in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>study,</v>

1785
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:13.550
<v Speaker 1>like they'd say if you ever had sex with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone and then regretted it or do we </v>

1786
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:16.020
<v Speaker 1>are coerced into having sex and things </v>
<v Speaker 1>along those lines.</v>

1787
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:19.050
<v Speaker 1>They called all of those rates and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think,</v>

1788
01:20:19.051 --> 01:20:21.060
<v Speaker 1>but I think their findings was like one </v>
<v Speaker 1>in five,</v>

1789
01:20:21.061 --> 01:20:22.530
<v Speaker 1>but now people are saying it's one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

1790
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:26.340
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you have to like not.</v>

1791
01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:30.120
<v Speaker 1>You have to censor yourself because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the you can choose to.</v>

1792
01:20:30.370 --> 01:20:32.760
<v Speaker 1>You can choose to if that's your style </v>
<v Speaker 1>of comedy,</v>

1793
01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:37.880
<v Speaker 1>you can choose to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for you to get mad at someone who </v>

1794
01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:37.880
<v Speaker 1>doesn't choose to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1795
01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

1796
01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:41.520
<v Speaker 1>This is a slippery slope and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't think it's a slippery slope</v>

1797
01:20:41.521 --> 01:20:44.700
<v Speaker 1>because you think it's all just about </v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting people's feelings,</v>

1798
01:20:44.701 --> 01:20:47.970
<v Speaker 1>especially victim's feelings and I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>your point,</v>

1799
01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:53.180
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go over this whole motherfucker </v>

1800
01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:54.960
<v Speaker 1>with a fine tooth comb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to do that.</v>

1801
01:20:55.080 --> 01:21:00.080
<v Speaker 1>You can't just single out standup comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's coming from one person and </v>

1802
01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:03.621
<v Speaker 1>not a giant movie where a woman gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>assaulted and beaten or raped or </v>

1803
01:21:03.621 --> 01:21:04.950
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of it has to be looked at,</v>

1804
01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:06.390
<v Speaker 1>but you have to look at the whole thing.</v>

1805
01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:09.470
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I and I also feel like I give myself the</v>

1806
01:21:09.471 --> 01:21:11.690
<v Speaker 5>same credit I give the audience like I </v>
<v Speaker 5>really do,</v>

1807
01:21:11.691 --> 01:21:16.691
<v Speaker 5>and it's like we all say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we want to just just treat people like </v>

1808
01:21:16.691 --> 01:21:16.691
<v Speaker 5>you want to be treated well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I treat the audience with the same level</v>

1809
01:21:16.691 --> 01:21:21.581
<v Speaker 5>of intellectual respect that I want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I went and saw Joan rivers and it's </v>

1810
01:21:21.581 --> 01:21:25.420
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the edgiest set I've ever seen a </v>

1811
01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:25.850
<v Speaker 5>comic do and I mean it's a few years ago</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the cutting room in New York.</v>

1812
01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:30.980
<v Speaker 5>She's doing nine slash 11 jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ai mean fucking brutal,</v>

1813
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:36.430
<v Speaker 5>and I was when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I literally wanted to cry at the end of </v>

1814
01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:38.570
<v Speaker 5>it because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is what we should be doing.</v>

1815
01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:43.730
<v Speaker 5>It is taking everything horrible that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>experienced and I mean horrible and </v>

1816
01:21:44.361 --> 01:21:48.050
<v Speaker 5>making a room full of people laugh about</v>
<v Speaker 5>it and when we walked out of there,</v>

1817
01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.280
<v Speaker 5>my feelings about nine slash 11 had not </v>
<v Speaker 5>changed my feelings about rape,</v>

1818
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:56.350
<v Speaker 5>my feelings about aids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not one thing she said made me value </v>

1819
01:21:56.350 --> 01:22:00.461
<v Speaker 5>those real experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 5>less not one thing she said made me </v>

1820
01:22:00.461 --> 01:22:02.090
<v Speaker 5>devalue anything made me lose respect </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the horror of nine.</v>

1821
01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:07.240
<v Speaker 5>Nothing changed for me other than I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>able to temporarily laugh at something </v>

1822
01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:10.961
<v Speaker 5>that I knew was awful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so why wouldn't I give my audience the </v>

1823
01:22:10.961 --> 01:22:14.171
<v Speaker 5>same credit for being able to come to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the conclusion I came to watching Joan </v>

1824
01:22:14.171 --> 01:22:14.171
<v Speaker 5>rivers well</v>

1825
01:22:14.171 --> 01:22:15.420
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take their argument.</v>

1826
01:22:15.421 --> 01:22:18.030
<v Speaker 1>It would be because you haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 1>raped,</v>

1827
01:22:18.210 --> 01:22:23.210
<v Speaker 1>you haven't been murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't lose loved ones in nine slash </v>

1828
01:22:23.210 --> 01:22:25.851
<v Speaker 1>11 and that what you should be doing by </v>
<v Speaker 1>omitting rape jokes is you should be </v>

1829
01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:29.520
<v Speaker 1>avoiding triggers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get ptsd triggers,</v>

1830
01:22:29.521 --> 01:22:32.490
<v Speaker 1>avoiding people freaking out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the rape while they're at</v>

1831
01:22:32.491 --> 01:22:37.491
<v Speaker 1>a comedy show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just try and have a good time and so </v>

1832
01:22:37.491 --> 01:22:39.651
<v Speaker 1>their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their opinion is set up entirely to </v>

1833
01:22:39.651 --> 01:22:42.891
<v Speaker 1>protect the victims of these crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a person like you has a </v>

1834
01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:46.611
<v Speaker 1>certain sensibility about nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joan rivers defies that sensibility but </v>

1835
01:22:46.611 --> 01:22:48.930
<v Speaker 1>does it in a humorous way and you walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>away with the same opinions that you had</v>

1836
01:22:48.931 --> 01:22:51.180
<v Speaker 1>going in because that's not really what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with.</v>

1837
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:53.820
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with is a victimization </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime,</v>

1838
01:22:53.821 --> 01:22:58.821
<v Speaker 1>a crime or someone's been dehumanized </v>
<v Speaker 1>and them being in the audience watching </v>

1839
01:22:58.821 --> 01:23:00.060
<v Speaker 1>you talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be more sensitive than that.</v>

1840
01:23:00.061 --> 01:23:05.061
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are very good argument and a lot </v>

1841
01:23:05.061 --> 01:23:05.061
<v Speaker 1>of ways.</v>

1842
01:23:05.061 --> 01:23:06.490
<v Speaker 5>My point back to them would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do understand</v>

1843
01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:07.420
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I said,</v>

1844
01:23:07.421 --> 01:23:09.640
<v Speaker 4>whenever I talk about tiger woods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his text messages,</v>

1845
01:23:09.641 --> 01:23:11.860
<v Speaker 4>I reveal my own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I talk about my own.</v>

1846
01:23:12.190 --> 01:23:14.710
<v Speaker 4>I also talk about things that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>injured me,</v>

1847
01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:18.160
<v Speaker 4>talk about my own suicide attempts in my</v>
<v Speaker 4>own sexual proclivities like so.</v>

1848
01:23:18.161 --> 01:23:23.161
<v Speaker 4>I include will you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you use certain things horrible and </v>

1849
01:23:23.161 --> 01:23:24.520
<v Speaker 4>things that have affected me and things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that haven't.</v>

1850
01:23:24.850 --> 01:23:29.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like I exclude things and if </v>

1851
01:23:29.850 --> 01:23:29.850
<v Speaker 4>you break down here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're like that.</v>

1852
01:23:29.850 --> 01:23:30.880
<v Speaker 4>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine tooth comb.</v>

1853
01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:35.170
<v Speaker 4>Every single joke or 90 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>jokes you do,</v>

1854
01:23:35.171 --> 01:23:37.690
<v Speaker 4>unless you're talking about balloons are</v>
<v Speaker 4>bouncing a ball,</v>

1855
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:39.630
<v Speaker 4>have hurt somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1856
01:23:39.670 --> 01:23:41.350
<v Speaker 4>he's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1857
01:23:41.351 --> 01:23:42.880
<v Speaker 4>was I drunk driving?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1858
01:23:42.881 --> 01:23:45.060
<v Speaker 4>That's children being killed by drunk </v>
<v Speaker 4>driving is not.</v>

1859
01:23:45.061 --> 01:23:50.061
<v Speaker 4>But if we get that literal with humor </v>
<v Speaker 4>than almost all jokes comics tell our </v>

1860
01:23:51.151 --> 01:23:56.151
<v Speaker 4>are going to be up for a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a careful examination and I think matt </v>

1861
01:23:56.151 --> 01:23:58.360
<v Speaker 4>and Trey said it's either all or none of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's okay.</v>

1862
01:23:58.630 --> 01:24:03.630
<v Speaker 4>I won't make pedophile jokes when Kevin </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking bacon can't play them in the </v>

1863
01:24:03.630 --> 01:24:05.530
<v Speaker 4>woodsmen I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't do gun jokes when fuck it.</v>

1864
01:24:05.531 --> 01:24:07.540
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood can't tell me how bad guns </v>
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

1865
01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:11.560
<v Speaker 4>And then they make a movie called two </v>
<v Speaker 4>guns with which I have no objection to,</v>

1866
01:24:11.710 --> 01:24:13.660
<v Speaker 4>but then don't fucking preach to me </v>
<v Speaker 4>about guns.</v>

1867
01:24:13.661 --> 01:24:15.990
<v Speaker 4>Motherfuckers just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1868
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:19.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what you do as an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>leave me alone as an artist.</v>

1869
01:24:19.241 --> 01:24:20.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't tell you what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't tell me what to do.</v>

1870
01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:22.200
<v Speaker 4>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1871
01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:25.230
<v Speaker 4>your point is dead on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a,</v>

1872
01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:27.310
<v Speaker 4>it's a very important point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1873
01:24:27.311 --> 01:24:28.720
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of censorship.</v>

1874
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:33.870
<v Speaker 4>I can understand that people don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone in the audience to be impacted </v>

1875
01:24:34.661 --> 01:24:39.661
<v Speaker 4>negatively about you making light of </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's a horrific crime that </v>

1876
01:24:39.661 --> 01:24:41.800
<v Speaker 4>they've suffered from personally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that doesn't mean you should stop.</v>

1877
01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:47.460
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it doesn't mean that you're a dick </v>

1878
01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:47.460
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it means is you're saying something</v>

1879
01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:51.841
<v Speaker 4>that hits them personally and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then maybe you shouldn't go see Jim </v>

1880
01:24:51.841 --> 01:24:56.460
<v Speaker 4>Norton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that sounds like a fucked up thing </v>

1881
01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:56.460
<v Speaker 4>to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But really that's,</v>

1882
01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:59.460
<v Speaker 4>that's the reality of the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what you're doing is a style of </v>

1883
01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:01.420
<v Speaker 4>art.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who don't want to be scared don't</v>

1884
01:25:01.421 --> 01:25:03.430
<v Speaker 4>go see the conjuring or the evil dead </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they don't.</v>

1885
01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:08.431
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't like horror movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How come nobody's trying to stop horror </v>

1886
01:25:08.431 --> 01:25:11.341
<v Speaker 4>movies?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People that don't like them don't go to </v>

1887
01:25:11.341 --> 01:25:13.861
<v Speaker 4>see them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the same way she'd be with certain </v>

1888
01:25:13.861 --> 01:25:14.020
<v Speaker 4>types of humor and what's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you break it down,</v>

1889
01:25:14.021 --> 01:25:17.920
<v Speaker 4>what's the worst that can happen if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>see something like,</v>

1890
01:25:17.921 --> 01:25:22.921
<v Speaker 4>am I going to talk about something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't show on law and order </v>

1891
01:25:22.921 --> 01:25:22.921
<v Speaker 4>constantly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

1892
01:25:22.921 --> 01:25:23.710
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing's a fucking rape murder </v>
<v Speaker 4>fest.</v>

1893
01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:28.950
<v Speaker 4>Everything people like it is a rape or a</v>
<v Speaker 4>murder or some kind of voyeurism and I </v>

1894
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:33.511
<v Speaker 4>will acknowledge and honor people's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>porn to violence.</v>

1895
01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:38.940
<v Speaker 4>When does an accident in the southbound </v>
<v Speaker 4>lane and the traffic in my lane doesn't </v>

1896
01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:42.961
<v Speaker 4>slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People slow down to look because they </v>

1897
01:25:42.961 --> 01:25:46.591
<v Speaker 4>want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to fucking see it on some </v>

1898
01:25:46.591 --> 01:25:49.531
<v Speaker 4>level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't admit they want to see </v>

1899
01:25:49.531 --> 01:25:49.531
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I hate their lack of admission.</v>

1900
01:25:49.531 --> 01:25:50.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a weird exclusion thing too.</v>

1901
01:25:50.981 --> 01:25:55.981
<v Speaker 4>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're discussing rape and you're not </v>

1902
01:25:55.981 --> 01:25:55.981
<v Speaker 4>discussing murder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1903
01:25:55.981 --> 01:26:00.060
<v Speaker 4>if you have anything that involves a </v>
<v Speaker 4>rape in a tweet or something,</v>

1904
01:26:00.191 --> 01:26:02.160
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a piece of shit or you know,</v>

1905
01:26:02.170 --> 01:26:07.170
<v Speaker 4>you should have had a tour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a trigger warning in there like this is </v>

1906
01:26:07.170 --> 01:26:07.170
<v Speaker 4>the attitude that a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking about this stuff,</v>

1907
01:26:07.170 --> 01:26:10.160
<v Speaker 4>but why does it have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why doesn't anybody have the same issues</v>

1908
01:26:10.161 --> 01:26:10.940
<v Speaker 4>about murders?</v>

1909
01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:13.650
<v Speaker 4>You can talk about a murder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can talk about like,</v>

1910
01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:19.320
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very rare that people get upset at </v>

1911
01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:20.270
<v Speaker 4>murder jokes or murder movies or </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything murder.</v>

1912
01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:24.920
<v Speaker 4>But there was a obama thing recently </v>
<v Speaker 4>where Obama said that,</v>

1913
01:26:24.921 --> 01:26:29.921
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could have been trayvon Martin and I </v>

1914
01:26:29.921 --> 01:26:29.921
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know who else he could've been?</v>

1915
01:26:29.921 --> 01:26:31.460
<v Speaker 4>It could've been a little kid that got </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed by drones,</v>

1916
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:32.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1917
01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:33.840
<v Speaker 4>nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1918
01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:35.080
<v Speaker 4>That's A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1919
01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:37.400
<v Speaker 4>it's not really a joke per se,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

1920
01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:41.930
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of like blocking him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mocking the idiocy of this.</v>

1921
01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:46.280
<v Speaker 4>But it's also bringing up murder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's bringing up people getting hit with</v>

1922
01:26:46.281 --> 01:26:47.990
<v Speaker 4>missiles now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bodies exploding.</v>

1923
01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:53.090
<v Speaker 4>Why is that image any less disturbing </v>
<v Speaker 4>than the image of rape?</v>

1924
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:55.460
<v Speaker 4>Are they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they equally disturbing or they both</v>

1925
01:26:55.461 --> 01:26:58.190
<v Speaker 4>off the menu or why are we only going </v>
<v Speaker 4>with rape off the menu?</v>

1926
01:26:58.191 --> 01:27:01.790
<v Speaker 4>How come there's like zero push to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>murder off the menu?</v>

1927
01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:03.290
<v Speaker 4>Their argument with bb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

1928
01:27:03.291 --> 01:27:05.390
<v Speaker 4>this is what they would say is because </v>
<v Speaker 4>rape,</v>

1929
01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:07.480
<v Speaker 4>murder victims were people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Murder,</v>

1930
01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:10.040
<v Speaker 4>is that you're not taught to be silent </v>
<v Speaker 4>about murder.</v>

1931
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:15.550
<v Speaker 4>You're taught to be silent about rape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of rape victims who </v>

1932
01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:18.761
<v Speaker 4>are too scared to report the crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one is scared to report a murder </v>

1933
01:27:18.761 --> 01:27:18.761
<v Speaker 4>lists mob thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1934
01:27:18.761 --> 01:27:20.960
<v Speaker 4>They're saying the perception of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>crime is different.</v>

1935
01:27:21.230 --> 01:27:26.230
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's such a shame with it where </v>

1936
01:27:26.230 --> 01:27:28.031
<v Speaker 4>there's not ashamed with murder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not ashamed with these other </v>

1937
01:27:28.031 --> 01:27:28.031
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

1938
01:27:28.031 --> 01:27:31.550
<v Speaker 4>I heard what she said and I listened to </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and I did get it,</v>

1939
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:37.330
<v Speaker 4>but I won't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't do a whole shitload of jokes on </v>

1940
01:27:37.330 --> 01:27:37.330
<v Speaker 4>rape victims anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1941
01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:42.640
<v Speaker 4>but if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it probably is the case then be for </v>

1942
01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:46.301
<v Speaker 4>castration of rape rapists or were fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that the recidivism rate is so </v>

1943
01:27:46.301 --> 01:27:48.290
<v Speaker 4>high in these fucking pigs because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're being.</v>

1944
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:53.290
<v Speaker 4>Let out of jail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like fight that don't worry about with </v>

1945
01:27:53.290 --> 01:27:56.080
<v Speaker 4>dumb jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>contributing to a fucking rape culture </v>

1946
01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:59.080
<v Speaker 4>is nonsense and it is to say comedian </v>
<v Speaker 4>contributes to rape culture is simply </v>

1947
01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:03.190
<v Speaker 4>bullshit and it's simplistic thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a way of saying I don't like what </v>

1948
01:28:03.190 --> 01:28:05.150
<v Speaker 4>you're saying and I don't want you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say it,</v>

1949
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:08.870
<v Speaker 4>but I can't come out with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I have to find a higher reason.</v>

1950
01:28:08.871 --> 01:28:11.120
<v Speaker 4>Which makes it sound like you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>say it for this reason.</v>

1951
01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even the term rape culture,</v>

1952
01:28:13.570 --> 01:28:15.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone in my message bird said,</v>

1953
01:28:15.330 --> 01:28:17.660
<v Speaker 4>do they have meetings?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a magazine.</v>

1954
01:28:17.661 --> 01:28:19.540
<v Speaker 4>Like is it really a culture?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

1955
01:28:19.570 --> 01:28:22.250
<v Speaker 4>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by calling it that,</v>

1956
01:28:22.251 --> 01:28:26.120
<v Speaker 4>by defining it in those terms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're calling it rape culture.</v>

1957
01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:31.240
<v Speaker 4>You would you put quotes around that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>starts to be real and what I don't mean </v>

1958
01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:32.270
<v Speaker 4>that it's going to encourage people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>rape,</v>

1959
01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:37.420
<v Speaker 4>but I mean the idea that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture that supports rape is going to </v>

1960
01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:41.141
<v Speaker 4>be real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be something that people </v>

1961
01:28:41.141 --> 01:28:41.660
<v Speaker 4>address as if it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Regardless of whether or not it is,</v>

1962
01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.240
<v Speaker 4>is it real that people rape?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely,</v>

1963
01:28:44.241 --> 01:28:46.250
<v Speaker 4>but it isn't real that our culture </v>
<v Speaker 4>supports it.</v>

1964
01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:49.040
<v Speaker 4>Fuck no man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course that most people have moms.</v>

1965
01:28:49.041 --> 01:28:50.930
<v Speaker 4>Most people have sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we,</v>

1966
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:55.990
<v Speaker 4>what we have a problem with in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>country is a lot of people are making </v>

1967
01:28:55.990 --> 01:29:00.011
<v Speaker 4>shitty human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of terrible fucking </v>

1968
01:29:00.011 --> 01:29:02.771
<v Speaker 4>parents are doing a shitty job and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>making shitty human beings and they're </v>

1969
01:29:02.771 --> 01:29:02.771
<v Speaker 4>also</v>

1970
01:29:02.771 --> 01:29:07.070
<v Speaker 1>raising these shitty human rings around </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of other kids that were created </v>

1971
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:11.181
<v Speaker 1>by shitty human beings and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what the fuck they're doing either </v>

1972
01:29:11.181 --> 01:29:11.181
<v Speaker 1>and no one's paying attention to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

1973
01:29:11.181 --> 01:29:15.711
<v Speaker 1>Making a human being and raising a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being is a massive undertaking and all </v>

1974
01:29:15.751 --> 01:29:17.460
<v Speaker 1>the people out there that are doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>their best.</v>

1975
01:29:17.610 --> 01:29:22.610
<v Speaker 1>I commend you and congratulate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the parents out there that are </v>

1976
01:29:22.610 --> 01:29:27.111
<v Speaker 1>taking their kid to wrestling classes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and martial arts and their daughter to </v>

1977
01:29:27.111 --> 01:29:28.410
<v Speaker 1>dance classes or martial arts if she </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to do it or anything.</v>

1978
01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Were you getting them involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities D,</v>

1979
01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:33.360
<v Speaker 1>building discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplining them,</v>

1980
01:29:33.361 --> 01:29:37.080
<v Speaker 1>developing their character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't get that in this life,</v>

1981
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:39.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't get taught how to behave,</v>

1982
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:44.270
<v Speaker 1>how to be a good human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the qualities and the values of </v>

1983
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:47.331
<v Speaker 1>friendship and community that should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>bestowed upon children at a very early </v>

1984
01:29:47.331 --> 01:29:48.600
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for most of us,</v>

1985
01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.070
<v Speaker 1>we have to get the fuck out of the house</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

1986
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:54.240
<v Speaker 1>We can even figure out that on our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we figured it out by friendships and</v>

1987
01:29:54.241 --> 01:29:57.120
<v Speaker 1>we figured it out by meeting people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and learning from them,</v>

1988
01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:02.160
<v Speaker 1>but we're doing a real shit job of </v>
<v Speaker 1>raising kids right out of the box and so</v>

1989
01:30:02.161 --> 01:30:07.161
<v Speaker 1>you come into life with a deficit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that deficit manifests itself in a bunch</v>

1990
01:30:07.351 --> 01:30:12.351
<v Speaker 1>of Shitty fucking behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's violence or whether it's </v>

1991
01:30:12.351 --> 01:30:12.570
<v Speaker 1>rape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's stealing,</v>

1992
01:30:12.571 --> 01:30:14.580
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's plagiarism,</v>

1993
01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:19.760
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's taking advantage of of of </v>

1994
01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:20.250
<v Speaker 1>people in any way like what are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing?</v>

1995
01:30:20.251 --> 01:30:25.251
<v Speaker 1>Like why you doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you being such a shitty human </v>

1996
01:30:25.251 --> 01:30:26.100
<v Speaker 1>being?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what is not emphasized enough</v>

1997
01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:27.780
<v Speaker 1>in our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about.</v>

1998
01:30:27.810 --> 01:30:30.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not just about making money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about getting ahead.</v>

1999
01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:34.440
<v Speaker 1>It's about cultivating good friendships </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a happy life,</v>

2000
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:36.510
<v Speaker 1>and the only way you could do that is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be nice.</v>

2001
01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Those motherfuckers that are ruthless </v>
<v Speaker 1>businessman,</v>

2002
01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:44.420
<v Speaker 1>those guys are all depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all a bunch of fucking crazy </v>

2003
01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:47.740
<v Speaker 1>assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taken Ambien to go to sleep abused and </v>

2004
01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:48.090
<v Speaker 1>hookers and others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2005

<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

2006
01:30:50.190 --> 01:30:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Most of them had their throats cut like </v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

2007
01:30:51.841 --> 01:30:56.841
<v Speaker 1>I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that would change a little bit </v>

2008
01:30:56.841 --> 01:30:56.841
<v Speaker 1>if we dragged a few of those business </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

2009
01:30:56.841 --> 01:30:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Not all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a few of them into the street and </v>

2010
01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:01.341
<v Speaker 1>killed him in the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that they would stop stealing </v>

2011
01:31:01.341 --> 01:31:01.341
<v Speaker 1>people's money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>coconuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different animal.</v>

<v Speaker 1>tall ones.</v>

<v Speaker 1>those aren't so good.</v>

01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:45.710
<v Speaker 1>But then the Thai coconuts.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So like if you're hung over,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu came in and brought a case of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit and started handing it out to </v>

<v Speaker 2>top and you have a little good to eat a </v>

2043

<v Speaker 2>little of the skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scoop it out with a spoon.</v>

2044
01:32:14.110 --> 01:32:19.110
<v Speaker 2>That's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can just hack the top off of a </v>

<v Speaker 2>delicious coconut and get a straw in </v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just found out like the blue </v>

<v Speaker 2>largest tobacco company.</v>

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

2056
01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:43.690

<v Speaker 2>a new company.</v>

2057
01:32:43.810 --> 01:32:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what their thing is now.</v>

2058
01:32:45.731 --> 01:32:48.280
<v Speaker 2>That's the way they're hit hooking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids on nicotine.</v>

2059
01:32:48.281 --> 01:32:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Now we have these fake cigarettes with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cool blue lights.</v>

<v Speaker 2>watermelon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now that's how they're getting there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they're making it better.</v>

2063
01:32:59.081 --> 01:33:04.081
<v Speaker 2>Now the kids are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know somebody that just got one of </v>

2069
01:33:07.450 --> 01:33:12.450

<v Speaker 2>I watched her for probably like five </v>

2070
01:33:12.450 --> 01:33:14.701
<v Speaker 2>hours nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just sucking on that thing like it was </v>

2071
01:33:14.701 --> 01:33:15.880
<v Speaker 2>air and those batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty impressive.</v>

2072

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those battery lasts pretty well.</v>

<v Speaker 2>plugs.</v>

2075
01:33:19.991 --> 01:33:23.260
<v Speaker 2>So they seem like a cool technology toy </v>
<v Speaker 2>box.</v>

2076
01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:23.770
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>box,</v>

2078

<v Speaker 2>pitching.</v>

2083
01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:38.920
<v Speaker 2>She's got the opposite of the Stephen </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dorff commercial.</v>

01:33:38.921 --> 01:33:40.260
<v Speaker 2>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing blue commercial.</v>

01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:41.500
<v Speaker 2>She's fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2086
01:33:41.530 --> 01:33:45.850
<v Speaker 2>I was the gathering of the Juggalos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you do anything crazy happen when?</v>

2087
01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:46.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2088
01:33:46.511 --> 01:33:51.511
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those guys off my cpa have been really </v>

2089
01:33:51.511 --> 01:33:52.570
<v Speaker 2>nice to me and I was hesitant to do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gig because I hear it's like,</v>

2090
01:33:52.571 --> 01:33:54.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the woods.</v>

2091
01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have never watched this.</v>

2092
01:33:55.901 --> 01:33:57.640
<v Speaker 2>I can't watch myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was this?</v>

2093
01:33:57.670 --> 01:33:59.770
<v Speaker 2>This was a TV show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right show on fuse.</v>

2094
01:33:59.950 --> 01:34:02.190
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the first interviews </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done confused.</v>

2095
01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:07.260
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where they just watched videos and kind </v>

2096
01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:07.260
<v Speaker 2>of mock them a second beavis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>butthead thing.</v>

2097
01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:08.830
<v Speaker 2>They smashed you in between them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what uncomfortably close?</v>

2098
01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of it to make.</v>

2099
01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was one of the first </v>

2100
01:34:15.610 --> 01:34:15.610
<v Speaker 2>interviews I ever did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did they want to touch you like that</v>

2101
01:34:15.610 --> 01:34:15.670
<v Speaker 2>while they're sitting there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2102
01:34:15.690 --> 01:34:19.360
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just for camera framing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a shitty job of camera framing.</v>

2103
01:34:19.410 --> 01:34:21.280
<v Speaker 2>They just block us all in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>

2104
01:34:21.281 --> 01:34:22.540
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the,</v>

2105
01:34:22.570 --> 01:34:27.570
<v Speaker 2>who's the cousin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that they just liked the </v>

2106
01:34:27.570 --> 01:34:27.570
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the fact that just really weird.</v>

2107
01:34:27.570 --> 01:34:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But together can I,</v>

2109
01:34:33.871 --> 01:34:36.310
<v Speaker 2>for the travel to it is an abomination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a really good gig and that </v>

2110
01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:39.580
<v Speaker 2>there's like 700 people in a tent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were nice.</v>

2111
01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:44.880
<v Speaker 2>They were a little bit chatty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nowhere near what you'd expected an </v>

2112
01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:48.930
<v Speaker 2>outdoor festival gig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I loved them and they will no </v>

<v Speaker 2>because she's a big fan of them and I </v>

<v Speaker 5>You get her back to hang out with </v>
<v Speaker 5>friends?</v>

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:18.410
<v Speaker 5>I have no shot at fucking or um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

<v Speaker 5>but I still like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I genuinely like her.</v>

2130
01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:21.410
<v Speaker 5>She's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:24.140
<v Speaker 5>Well there'll be no sexual and she </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't mind you beat off thinking about</v>

2132

<v Speaker 5>her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh no,</v>

<v Speaker 5>behind her and beat off.</v>

2135
01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:33.740
<v Speaker 5>Had she said she'd been listening to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ONA about you talking about or has he </v>

2136
01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:33.860
<v Speaker 5>said anything about that?</v>

2137
01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:36.230
<v Speaker 5>People tweet her and she's happy that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

2138
01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:37.730

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:51.590
<v Speaker 5>premieres on epics on uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this month,</v>

2146
01:35:51.591 --> 01:35:53.400
<v Speaker 5>August the 23rd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2147
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:54.260
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking all over.</v>

2148
01:35:54.261 --> 01:35:56.060
<v Speaker 5>What an unprofessional.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How to look at the camera.</v>

2149
01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:57.930
<v Speaker 5>Am I looking at the wrong one right </v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

2150
01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:58.960
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's the uh,</v>

2151
01:35:59.350 --> 01:36:04.350
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're showing them talking and it's </v>

2152
01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:04.350
<v Speaker 5>August 23rd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's on Epix.</v>

2153
01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:05.780
<v Speaker 5>And if you don't have that because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>epics hd.com</v>

2154
01:36:05.781 --> 01:36:08.120
<v Speaker 5>and you can get a free trial </v>
<v Speaker 5>subscription.</v>

2155
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:11.330
<v Speaker 5>So whether or not you want to keep epics</v>
<v Speaker 5>is up to you,</v>

2156
01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:16.360
<v Speaker 5>but get the trial subscription online </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you can watch it whenever you </v>

2157
01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:16.360
<v Speaker 5>want.</v>

2158
01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.340
<v Speaker 5>But I'm actually really happy with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2159
01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:20.090
<v Speaker 5>is this something that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>eventually like,</v>

2160
01:36:20.091 --> 01:36:21.030
<v Speaker 5>do you own this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

2161
01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:22.760
<v Speaker 5>Only you can sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will,</v>

2162
01:36:22.761 --> 01:36:23.500
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>

2163
01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:26.900
<v Speaker 5>But I want people to go and see it there</v>
<v Speaker 5>because epics gave me money to do it and</v>

2164
01:36:26.901 --> 01:36:31.901
<v Speaker 5>they artistically got out of my way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are amazing as far as for a </v>

2165
01:36:31.901 --> 01:36:35.231
<v Speaker 5>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the only thing you could do better than </v>

2166
01:36:35.231 --> 01:36:36.770
<v Speaker 5>with them as a network is just do it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>shoot it yourself and put it on your own</v>

2167
01:36:36.771 --> 01:36:39.590
<v Speaker 5>tv because they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very good about leaving you alone,</v>

2168
01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:43.130
<v Speaker 5>which is a lot of comedian wants us to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be left the fuck alone from a network.</v>

2169
01:36:43.190 --> 01:36:45.050
<v Speaker 5>I know that Sam Roberts is in town right</v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

2170
01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:47.740
<v Speaker 5>You guys are going to get to hook up and</v>
<v Speaker 5>do anything when he,</v>

2171
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:49.130
<v Speaker 5>I think he's coming into tonight.</v>

2172
01:36:49.190 --> 01:36:51.200
<v Speaker 5>I probably won't see him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just too busy.</v>

2173
01:36:51.201 --> 01:36:54.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing a bunch of shit today and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of shit tomorrow.</v>

2174
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:56.060
<v Speaker 5>And then I go home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2175
01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:58.250
<v Speaker 5>and Wednesday I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very busy every day.</v>

2176
01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:03.640
<v Speaker 5>But I came out and I want it because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll be on Netflix and like eight </v>

2177
01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:06.401
<v Speaker 5>months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I legitimately wanted to do promo </v>

2178
01:37:06.401 --> 01:37:09.221
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for this network because they've taken </v>

2179
01:37:09.221 --> 01:37:09.290
<v Speaker 5>good care of me and you don't get many </v>
<v Speaker 5>people like that anymore.</v>

2180
01:37:09.291 --> 01:37:11.260
<v Speaker 5>That give you the fucking freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2181
01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:16.300
<v Speaker 5>because every network person wants to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get their hands on your business and </v>

2182
01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:17.060
<v Speaker 5>they don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What for you and your special for epics?</v>

2183
01:37:17.061 --> 01:37:18.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've been really good about it,</v>

2184
01:37:18.381 --> 01:37:19.850
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm the opening.</v>

2185
01:37:19.851 --> 01:37:24.851
<v Speaker 5>They were little heads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got an opening which I was really </v>

2186
01:37:24.851 --> 01:37:26.801
<v Speaker 5>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I got someone special for my </v>

2187
01:37:26.801 --> 01:37:26.801
<v Speaker 5>opening and they were a little like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2188
01:37:26.801 --> 01:37:26.801
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2189
01:37:26.801 --> 01:37:29.510
<v Speaker 5>it wound up working out and they left me</v>
<v Speaker 5>alone and they were happy with it.</v>

2190
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:31.370
<v Speaker 5>Who's on your opening?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to say I'll show.</v>

2191
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:34.490
<v Speaker 5>I'll show it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a secret.</v>

2192
01:37:34.491 --> 01:37:36.020
<v Speaker 5>Jimmy and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should,</v>

2193
01:37:36.021 --> 01:37:41.021
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because last year I had ozzie do it and </v>

2194
01:37:41.021 --> 01:37:41.021
<v Speaker 5>ozzy and Sharon both tweeted like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they really helped me out.</v>

2195
01:37:41.021 --> 01:37:41.940
<v Speaker 5>Oh that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this one,</v>

2196
01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:43.160
<v Speaker 5>Jonathan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're listening,</v>

2197
01:37:43.161 --> 01:37:48.161
<v Speaker 5>could you email it to me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll email it to joke because I have </v>

2198
01:37:48.161 --> 01:37:48.161
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2199
01:37:48.161 --> 01:37:48.161
<v Speaker 5>no one has seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like for people that have seen it,</v>

2200
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:50.180
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean like that's big,</v>
<v Speaker 5>special secret.</v>

2201
01:37:50.181 --> 01:37:51.130
<v Speaker 5>Nobody gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

2202
01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:52.610
<v Speaker 5>I just haven't it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand.</v>

2203
01:37:52.611 --> 01:37:54.440
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to let out the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got a secret.</v>

2204
01:37:54.441 --> 01:37:55.710
<v Speaker 5>You create,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you crafted something.</v>

2205
01:37:55.770 --> 01:37:56.140
<v Speaker 5>Put together</v>

2206
01:37:56.140 --> 01:38:01.140
<v Speaker 1>a little secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use it to promote the </v>

2207
01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:02.581
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nice it epics is not fucking with </v>

2208
01:38:02.581 --> 01:38:02.581
<v Speaker 1>you and letting you do whatever you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

2209
01:38:02.581 --> 01:38:02.581
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2210
01:38:02.581 --> 01:38:03.360
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done.</v>

2211
01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:06.390
<v Speaker 1>I tried before I ever did my first </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy central special.</v>

2212
01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Why was on spike first?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

2213
01:38:08.501 --> 01:38:10.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was on comedy central,</v>

2214
01:38:10.021 --> 01:38:14.430
<v Speaker 1>but before that there was a round I went</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they went over some of my material</v>

2215
01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:15.600
<v Speaker 1>and then be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2216
01:38:15.690 --> 01:38:17.730
<v Speaker 1>you can't say this now you can't say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2217
01:38:17.731 --> 01:38:21.480
<v Speaker 1>This is no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even beat that out like this.</v>

2218
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:22.530
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got to be like,</v>

2219
01:38:22.531 --> 01:38:23.490
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't do this.</v>

2220
01:38:23.610 --> 01:38:27.150
<v Speaker 1>It's too frustrating to have to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have all that stuff.</v>

2221
01:38:27.210 --> 01:38:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2222
01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:31.080
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have any content issue like </v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

2223
01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:33.570
<v Speaker 1>As long as you're not slandering </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody or liable,</v>

2224
01:38:33.571 --> 01:38:36.280
<v Speaker 1>whichever is the spoken word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

2225
01:38:36.290 --> 01:38:36.990
<v Speaker 1>you got to be careful.</v>

2226
01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:39.150
<v Speaker 1>You can't walk up and just say things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are going to get you sued.</v>

2227
01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing they care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they were like fine with it.</v>

2228
01:38:41.850 --> 01:38:44.010
<v Speaker 1>They were very hands off and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>

2229
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.390
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2230
01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.630
<v Speaker 1>it was refreshing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2231
01:38:45.631 --> 01:38:47.250
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is Jimmy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that this,</v>

2232
01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:52.320
<v Speaker 1>this the same thing that we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how there's a broad spectrum of </v>

2233
01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:57.050
<v Speaker 1>art that people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's music or movies or </v>

2234
01:38:57.050 --> 01:38:59.811
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also a broad spectrum of of </v>

2235
01:38:59.811 --> 01:39:03.000
<v Speaker 1>content distribution methods and the one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've all been stuck with.</v>

2236
01:39:03.001 --> 01:39:06.090
<v Speaker 1>It was television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes commercial,</v>

2237
01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:11.110
<v Speaker 1>another 15 minutes commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these fucking commercials and all </v>

2238
01:39:11.110 --> 01:39:14.631
<v Speaker 1>these breaks and all this editing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this censorship and all this shit </v>

2239
01:39:14.631 --> 01:39:19.041
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to sell in between and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Toyota cars and tide detergent and all </v>

2240
01:39:19.041 --> 01:39:22.590
<v Speaker 1>this shit that they're doing it other </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the actual performance itself.</v>

2241
01:39:22.590 --> 01:39:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden the internet comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>along and then like Louis,</v>

2242
01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:25.770
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k,</v>

2243
01:39:25.771 --> 01:39:28.290
<v Speaker 1>did you release it all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sell it for five bucks,</v>

2244
01:39:28.291 --> 01:39:29.880
<v Speaker 1>you watched the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an entirety,</v>

2245
01:39:30.150 --> 01:39:31.380
<v Speaker 1>and then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2246
01:39:31.381 --> 01:39:33.480
<v Speaker 1>why would I ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would I ever fucking do it any other</v>

2247
01:39:33.481 --> 01:39:38.481
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would I try to listen to a bunch of </v>

2248
01:39:38.481 --> 01:39:41.901
<v Speaker 1>other people try to shape it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>put sandwich commercials in it and then </v>

2249
01:39:41.901 --> 01:39:45.591
<v Speaker 1>sensor it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's such a shitty way of </v>

2250
01:39:45.591 --> 01:39:45.591
<v Speaker 1>distributing content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2251
01:39:45.591 --> 01:39:45.591
<v Speaker 1>and if became can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

2252
01:39:45.591 --> 01:39:47.730
<v Speaker 1>The only way we knew was that it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>we ever had.</v>

2253
01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a new way and Louis changed </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things because the networks </v>

2254
01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:53.460
<v Speaker 1>realize that they have a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of power still,</v>

2255
01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:56.290
<v Speaker 1>but that is slipping and slipping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

2256
01:39:56.310 --> 01:40:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I think you could do an online special </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to identity.</v>

2257
01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did?</v>

2258
01:40:01.111 --> 01:40:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my last one was totally online.</v>

2259
01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:04.860
<v Speaker 1>I did it on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I paid for it,</v>

2260
01:40:04.861 --> 01:40:09.000
<v Speaker 1>did it online and then sold it to comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>central comedy central now and I'm going</v>

2261
01:40:09.001 --> 01:40:13.440
<v Speaker 1>to do another one and I'm going to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way and it's like Louis said,</v>

2262
01:40:13.441 --> 01:40:15.720
<v Speaker 1>a perfect bar too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so nobody can get greedy.</v>

2263
01:40:15.930 --> 01:40:17.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

2264
01:40:17.221 --> 01:40:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Louise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like top shelf a plus standup comic,</v>

2265
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:23.080
<v Speaker 1>one of the greatest step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2266
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:28.310
<v Speaker 1>of our generation without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like between him and rock and Chappelle </v>

2267
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:29.310
<v Speaker 1>was like four or five people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest of our generation.</v>

2268
01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:34.520
<v Speaker 1>So if he puts up a $5 special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it costs now everybody's </v>

2269
01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:38.730
<v Speaker 1>going to do five bucks now because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody stepped up first and try to do </v>

2270
01:40:38.730 --> 01:40:39.030
<v Speaker 1>20 and then if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2271
01:40:39.031 --> 01:40:41.430
<v Speaker 1>it would have been one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like kind of what do I price it at?</v>

2272
01:40:41.730 --> 01:40:46.730
<v Speaker 1>He made it a super reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just that he was the pioneer </v>

2273
01:40:46.730 --> 01:40:49.911
<v Speaker 1>and doing the first one like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that he set the bar as far as </v>

2274
01:40:49.911 --> 01:40:50.360
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2275
01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:50.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2276
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:53.500
<v Speaker 1>the expense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it really reasonably.</v>

2277
01:40:53.501 --> 01:40:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's</v>

2278
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.110
<v Speaker 4>very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very smart to do that.</v>

2279
01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:57.650
<v Speaker 4>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>

2280
01:40:57.690 --> 01:41:00.340
<v Speaker 4>And it's also when you cut out all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other bullshit,</v>

2281
01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:03.790
<v Speaker 4>like as far as like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he cut out all the other bullshit as far</v>

2282
01:41:03.791 --> 01:41:07.180
<v Speaker 4>as like networks and commercials and </v>
<v Speaker 4>putting them on,</v>

2283
01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:07.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

2284
01:41:07.991 --> 01:41:12.991
<v Speaker 4>the amount of production money that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be paid off by commercials and all </v>

2285
01:41:12.991 --> 01:41:17.551
<v Speaker 4>that jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we take all that out of the </v>

2286
01:41:17.551 --> 01:41:19.621
<v Speaker 4>equation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like pretty easy to get your money </v>

2287
01:41:19.621 --> 01:41:19.621
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2288
01:41:19.621 --> 01:41:22.470
<v Speaker 4>you have to sell that much to get your </v>
<v Speaker 4>money back and then it becomes </v>

2289
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.470
<v Speaker 4>profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2290
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:24.040
<v Speaker 4>unless you're dealing with one of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking networks or production companies</v>

2291
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:28.420
<v Speaker 4>that want to sneak in a 30 percent a </v>
<v Speaker 4>distribution fee on top of everything,</v>

2292
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:30.610
<v Speaker 4>they fucked so many guys doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>

2293
01:41:30.611 --> 01:41:31.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2294
01:41:31.090 --> 01:41:36.090
<v Speaker 4>Like you get some back end money but </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't tell you that the 30 percent </v>

2295
01:41:36.090 --> 01:41:36.090
<v Speaker 4>distribution fee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a vague,</v>

2296
01:41:36.090 --> 01:41:38.470
<v Speaker 4>you're paying a vague comes off.</v>

2297
01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:40.420
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we made $100 but no,</v>

2298
01:41:40.421 --> 01:41:42.760
<v Speaker 4>we only made 70 because it's 30 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>distribution becomes other.</v>

2299
01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:43.630
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's it for?</v>

2300
01:41:43.631 --> 01:41:44.990
<v Speaker 4>Well it's just the distribution of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2301
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:48.730
<v Speaker 4>it's a nonexistent fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

2302
01:41:48.731 --> 01:41:53.350
<v Speaker 4>it's nice to be on my own with this one </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I own it and epics is leasing it and</v>

2303
01:41:53.351 --> 01:41:58.351
<v Speaker 4>they were amazing about well you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on serious and you guys are on </v>

2304
01:41:58.351 --> 01:42:00.650
<v Speaker 4>five days a week or some time Monday </v>
<v Speaker 4>through Friday,</v>

2305
01:42:00.650 --> 01:42:01.540
<v Speaker 4>Monday through Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

2306
01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.850
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever think about doing something </v>
<v Speaker 4>on your own?</v>

2307
01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:06.490
<v Speaker 4>Do you see like in the time that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

2308
01:42:06.850 --> 01:42:11.850
<v Speaker 4>like you guys were one of the first on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sirius satellite radio and you know,</v>

2309
01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:17.160
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion like that move that where </v>
<v Speaker 4>we got shifted over to Sirius Satellite </v>

2310
01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:21.010
<v Speaker 4>Radio that changed a lot of like </v>
<v Speaker 4>people's ideas of how to do a radio show</v>

2311
01:42:21.190 --> 01:42:26.190
<v Speaker 4>because between you guys and Stern,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden we heard swearing on a </v>

2312
01:42:26.190 --> 01:42:28.330
<v Speaker 4>regular basis on a radio show and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>became brewer brewer show,</v>

2313
01:42:29.050 --> 01:42:29.890
<v Speaker 4>brewer unleashed.</v>

2314
01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:32.860
<v Speaker 4>You got to hear like people just hanging</v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

2315
01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:36.850
<v Speaker 4>And then I think that is what gave birth</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a lot of podcasts.</v>

2316
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:39.210
<v Speaker 4>But you don't do a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No lie.</v>

2317
01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:40.090
<v Speaker 4>You know what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get,</v>

2318
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:43.420
<v Speaker 4>I get 20 hours a week with those guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we replay all day.</v>

2319
01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:45.910
<v Speaker 4>I have five nights a week on Ozzy's </v>
<v Speaker 4>boneyard.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's my new obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one talk show and I have one scripted</v>

2333
01:43:16.121 --> 01:43:19.420
<v Speaker 4>show which I actually think is good and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm ultra critical.</v>

2334
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:24.430
<v Speaker 4>My Shit and I always think it stinks but</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm actually happy with this so </v>

<v Speaker 4>do it online.</v>

2336
01:43:25.931 --> 01:43:27.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm just not big enough to do it online </v>
<v Speaker 4>yet.</v>

2337
01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:29.730
<v Speaker 4>I hope you never leave Ona,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you ever did leave on a,</v>

2338
01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:31.720
<v Speaker 4>you would have a gigantic fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>

2339
01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:36.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I wouldn't and I mean maybe </v>

2340
01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:36.780
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like,</v>

2341
01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:36.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would be like,</v>

2342
01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:39.130
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be afraid to do that.</v>

2343
01:43:39.131 --> 01:43:44.131
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love interviewing people that are </v>

2344
01:43:44.131 --> 01:43:44.131
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love doing it,</v>

2345
01:43:44.131 --> 01:43:47.460
<v Speaker 4>but I'm said East Coast podcast man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just don't trust podcast on the </v>

2346
01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:51.451
<v Speaker 4>east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only one I got spoiled with radio </v>

2347
01:43:51.451 --> 01:43:51.451
<v Speaker 4>because I'm so used to doing it that </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

2348
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2349
01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:53.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do it on my own.</v>

2350
01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:58.600
<v Speaker 3>I love your set up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a bigger studio that we do and </v>

2351
01:43:58.600 --> 01:43:59.330
<v Speaker 3>I love the way you've got to set up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a great hang and it's well done.</v>

2352
01:43:59.450 --> 01:43:59.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2353
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.000
<v Speaker 3>this place I just had realized that </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere along the line I was </v>

2354
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:05.000
<v Speaker 3>eventually going to have to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2355
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.970
<v Speaker 3>So I found this office space and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the course of a few months put it </v>

2356
01:44:09.970 --> 01:44:13.631
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really only become functional </v>

2357
01:44:13.631 --> 01:44:15.820
<v Speaker 3>over the last few months because for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>longest time we had a terrible Internet </v>

2358
01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:15.820
<v Speaker 3>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a pain the Deq to build something.</v>

2359
01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:16.360
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2360
01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:20.100
<v Speaker 3>We had to get a fat pipe put in here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like 100 megabytes up and down.</v>

2361
01:44:20.101 --> 01:44:25.101
<v Speaker 3>It's a tremendous Internet connection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now we can stream and like easy with </v>

2362
01:44:25.101 --> 01:44:29.021
<v Speaker 3>no hiccups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>download things at ridiculous speeds </v>

2363
01:44:29.021 --> 01:44:29.300
<v Speaker 3>before we were like crippled with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty DSL connection.</v>

2364
01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:31.520
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things that go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>building.</v>

2365
01:44:31.521 --> 01:44:33.890
<v Speaker 3>One of these things are hiring people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>build these things,</v>

2366
01:44:33.891 --> 01:44:36.860
<v Speaker 3>but it's cool to do because it's cool to</v>
<v Speaker 3>like make it your way.</v>

2367
01:44:36.861 --> 01:44:38.060
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a brick behind me.</v>

2368
01:44:38.061 --> 01:44:39.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's make it bricks.</v>

2369
01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.750
<v Speaker 3>I want a werewolf in the lobby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2370
01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:41.480
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2371
01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:42.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to.</v>

2372
01:44:42.731 --> 01:44:45.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oak wall or Oak table that's made out of</v>

2373
01:44:45.321 --> 01:44:49.190
<v Speaker 3>100 year old reprocessed farm wood or </v>
<v Speaker 3>reclaimed barn wood.</v>

2374
01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:51.410
<v Speaker 3>So you can do shit like that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's yours.</v>

2375
01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:56.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you don't have to go through a </v>

2376
01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:56.460
<v Speaker 3>bunch of producers like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we want is the.</v>

2377
01:44:56.460 --> 01:45:00.160
<v Speaker 3>You see this thing behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This goofy fucking fell in love that is </v>

2378
01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:02.450
<v Speaker 3>created by producers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want one of these things on the wall,</v>

2379
01:45:03.050 --> 01:45:05.120
<v Speaker 3>these black things that look like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>swastika.</v>

2380
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:09.440
<v Speaker 3>They were claiming that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>claiming that they're supposed to go.</v>

2381
01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:11.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind it though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

2382
01:45:11.730 --> 01:45:16.730
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't hurt the room at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the whole setup here is great </v>

2383
01:45:16.730 --> 01:45:16.730
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2384
01:45:16.730 --> 01:45:18.320
<v Speaker 3>I will be too nervous to do my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

2385
01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:19.280
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're so crazy.</v>

2386
01:45:19.281 --> 01:45:20.800
<v Speaker 3>You'd be awesome at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I dunno,</v>

2387
01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:22.760
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bore myself a lot.</v>

2388
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:27.790
<v Speaker 3>Like I hate listening to myself unless </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing uncle Paul then it doesn't </v>

2389
01:45:27.790 --> 01:45:28.760
<v Speaker 3>sound like me at all and I can listen to</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2390
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Well that is the problem with doing like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of hours,</v>

2391
01:45:31.071 --> 01:45:36.071
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do a lot of hours on the radio and </v>

2392
01:45:36.071 --> 01:45:36.071
<v Speaker 3>after awhile you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn it.</v>

2393
01:45:36.071 --> 01:45:39.431
<v Speaker 3>I don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that sometimes we do three in a </v>

2394
01:45:39.431 --> 01:45:39.431
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do three,</v>

2395
01:45:39.431 --> 01:45:39.650
<v Speaker 3>three hour shows in a week I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2396
01:45:39.651 --> 01:45:41.540
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but after like three,</v>

2397
01:45:41.570 --> 01:45:44.030
<v Speaker 3>like three is where I feel like I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to hear me anymore,</v>

2398
01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:45.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired of me.</v>

2399
01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:47.440
<v Speaker 3>So you must be tired of me to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2400
01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:49.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 20 hours a week we do and uh,</v>

2401
01:45:49.611 --> 01:45:50.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2402
01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:53.180
<v Speaker 3>it's draining sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also fun,</v>

2403
01:45:53.210 --> 01:45:58.210
<v Speaker 3>but it's also developed your </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation skills and that's one of </v>

2404
01:45:58.210 --> 01:46:00.500
<v Speaker 3>the reasons why I really enjoy you like </v>
<v Speaker 3>in that a lindy west thing.</v>

2405
01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:02.600
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a fascinating debate.</v>

2406
01:46:02.601 --> 01:46:07.601
<v Speaker 3>You were the perfect person for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're so succinct with your </v>

2407
01:46:07.601 --> 01:46:10.571
<v Speaker 3>words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're so used to being involved in </v>

2408
01:46:10.571 --> 01:46:11.810
<v Speaker 3>disagreements with people that you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2409
01:46:11.811 --> 01:46:16.811
<v Speaker 3>how to keep things civil no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one of my favorite disagreements </v>

2410
01:46:16.811 --> 01:46:20.591
<v Speaker 3>with you was the Jesse Ventura one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesse Ventura got all dickie with you </v>

2411
01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:22.820
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he tried to get like,</v>

2412
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:27.910
<v Speaker 3>he tried to get abusive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he tried to get like put his hand on </v>

2413
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:27.910
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tried to bully you a little bit,</v>

2414
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:29.420
<v Speaker 3>a little bit and you called him out on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and it was,</v>

2415
01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:31.070
<v Speaker 3>it was really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2416
01:46:31.071 --> 01:46:32.900
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm much more likely,</v>

2417
01:46:32.901 --> 01:46:34.610
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't like to see weak people.</v>

2418
01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:35.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2419
01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:40.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm much more likely to argue with a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>who could throw me through a wall and </v>

2420
01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:42.020
<v Speaker 3>it's not a little man complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2421
01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:44.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't like when Paris Hilton was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was not a good guest.</v>

2422
01:46:44.871 --> 01:46:46.880
<v Speaker 3>She's a Vapid jazz bagging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hated her,</v>

2423
01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 3>but she wasn't being vicious eyesight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

2424
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:51.630
<v Speaker 4>just too easy to attack her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2425
01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:56.680
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She gives a fuck if I do Jesse then </v>

2426
01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:59.041
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did not want to have this interaction </v>

2427
01:46:59.041 --> 01:46:59.041
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have preferred it to be civil.</v>

2428
01:46:59.041 --> 01:47:00.860
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the video does not tell the whole story.</v>

2429
01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:03.150
<v Speaker 4>The audio tells the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the video because opiates,</v>

2430
01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:08.160
<v Speaker 4>so ocd and nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't take all of the taped like </v>

2431
01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:10.940
<v Speaker 4>when it started to get heated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Jessie was more aggressive with me </v>

2432
01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:12.000
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2433
01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:14.820
<v Speaker 4>when he patted me on the way out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew he wasn't trying to hurt me.</v>

2434
01:47:15.150 --> 01:47:20.150
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way for me to equal him was to pat </v>

2435
01:47:20.150 --> 01:47:20.200
<v Speaker 4>him and he was fucking sick.</v>

2436
01:47:21.210 --> 01:47:22.910
<v Speaker 6>Why you want to go back that far with </v>
<v Speaker 6>the Kennedy?</v>

2437
01:47:22.911 --> 01:47:25.790
<v Speaker 6>We can't go back to Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You said to me were with those guys.</v>

2438
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:33.470
<v Speaker 6>We're not going to send,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we send our guys love to war without </v>

2439
01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:34.300
<v Speaker 6>giving a shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm telling you that's not true.</v>

2440
01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:37.030
<v Speaker 6>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When did you go to war?</v>

2441
01:47:37.210 --> 01:47:39.220
<v Speaker 6>I've never been in the industry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't know,</v>

2442
01:47:39.221 --> 01:47:42.130
<v Speaker 6>but I say pull them out of everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I've never been in the military.</v>

2443
01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:47.020
<v Speaker 6>When we are attacked by a nation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we should not be proven first.</v>

2444
01:47:47.021 --> 01:47:48.790
<v Speaker 6>I feel we proved that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You feel we did.</v>

2445
01:47:48.850 --> 01:47:51.550
<v Speaker 6>You also feel that fucking Bush was </v>
<v Speaker 6>behind nine slash 11,</v>

2446
01:47:51.610 --> 01:47:55.150
<v Speaker 6>so we're always going to district very </v>
<v Speaker 6>go put fucking words in my mouth.</v>

2447
01:47:55.210 --> 01:47:57.220
<v Speaker 6>You feel that the US government was </v>
<v Speaker 6>behind it.</v>

2448
01:47:59.290 --> 01:48:01.760
<v Speaker 6>Who Do you think you are covering it </v>
<v Speaker 6>all?</v>

2449
01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:03.860
<v Speaker 6>You have not been told the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you feel like,</v>

2450
01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:04.690
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

2451
01:48:04.691 --> 01:48:05.890
<v Speaker 6>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>

2452
01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:08.530
<v Speaker 6>if you'll calm down the moment you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>yelling,</v>

2453
01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:13.720
<v Speaker 6>you're the governor talking your </v>
<v Speaker 6>language,</v>

2454
01:48:13.721 --> 01:48:16.000
<v Speaker 6>so you're wondering how you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>bring it down to my level.</v>

2455
01:48:16.001 --> 01:48:21.001
<v Speaker 6>Bring me up to yours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw that you said about not going to </v>

2456
01:48:23.651 --> 01:48:26.310
<v Speaker 6>let me talk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm out the door talking the whole time.</v>

2457
01:48:26.311 --> 01:48:29.140
<v Speaker 6>All you do is yell over people and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't want to address point by point.</v>

2458
01:48:29.770 --> 01:48:32.070
<v Speaker 6>You Act like we say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>send our boys to fuck them.</v>

2459
01:48:32.290 --> 01:48:34.570
<v Speaker 6>We've never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I agree with you.</v>

2460
01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:37.900
<v Speaker 6>I want to pull them out of Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to pull them everywhere.</v>

2461
01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:40.360
<v Speaker 6>The US military should never be dying </v>
<v Speaker 6>for other countries.</v>

2462
01:48:40.630 --> 01:48:44.250
<v Speaker 6>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't care if Kim's job,</v>

2463
01:48:44.251 --> 01:48:46.150
<v Speaker 6>you'll take this out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not my business.</v>

2464
01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:51.540
<v Speaker 6>I just think that if we're attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have the right to want our military </v>

2465
01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:52.120
<v Speaker 6>to respond,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so that's not some warmonger saying,</v>

2466
01:48:52.121 --> 01:48:53.350
<v Speaker 6>fuck the voice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Send them over.</v>

2467
01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:01.320
<v Speaker 6>That's what I walked in and he sits and </v>
<v Speaker 6>looks at Jimmy.</v>

2468
01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:05.050
<v Speaker 6>Why Awkward?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was a fair point.</v>

2469
01:49:05.051 --> 01:49:06.700
<v Speaker 6>I just made you a raw when you said </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

2470
01:49:06.730 --> 01:49:11.730
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't listen to over,</v>

2471
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:19.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yelling at me because I'm not talking.</v>

2472
01:49:19.721 --> 01:49:21.610
<v Speaker 6>I'm not yelling at you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just telling you back to your point.</v>

2473
01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:25.450
<v Speaker 6>You accused us of something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So let's say that you guys are just full</v>

2474
01:49:25.451 --> 01:49:27.310
<v Speaker 6>of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Interesting</v>

2475
01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:27.840
<v Speaker 4>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy,</v>

2476
01:49:27.841 --> 01:49:29.430
<v Speaker 4>because you're a liberal and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways,</v>

2477
01:49:29.431 --> 01:49:31.500
<v Speaker 4>but you're also conservative in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>

2478
01:49:31.590 --> 01:49:32.340
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2479
01:49:32.341 --> 01:49:33.090
<v Speaker 4>thank you John.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2481
01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:39.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're very conservative and right wing </v>

2482
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:39.990
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Certainly you're also very liberal.</v>

2483
01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:45.020
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you still like to hear what you're </v>

2484
01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:47.451
<v Speaker 4>saying in this and you still stand by </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're saying about pulling our </v>

2485
01:49:47.451 --> 01:49:47.451
<v Speaker 4>government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our military out of everywhere.</v>

2486
01:49:47.451 --> 01:49:48.250
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

2487
01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:50.770
<v Speaker 5>You think fuck the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck Egypt.</v>

2488
01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:53.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm sick of given them money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When people hear,</v>

2489
01:49:53.171 --> 01:49:53.950
<v Speaker 5>don't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2490
01:49:54.090 --> 01:49:59.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm tired of US fucking telling </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody else how to live their lives </v>

2491
01:49:59.090 --> 01:49:59.200
<v Speaker 5>and we don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We tell,</v>

2492
01:49:59.201 --> 01:50:01.570
<v Speaker 5>we tell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we tell people don't do this,</v>

2493
01:50:01.630 --> 01:50:03.310
<v Speaker 5>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And meanwhile,</v>

2494
01:50:03.550 --> 01:50:05.590
<v Speaker 5>if two guys want to get married,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can't.</v>

2495
01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:08.350
<v Speaker 5>If we were not full of shit and we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>consistent,</v>

2496
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:10.720
<v Speaker 5>I'd be fine with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just don't.</v>

2497
01:50:10.721 --> 01:50:13.420
<v Speaker 5>I just think that the rest of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck them.</v>

2498
01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:16.900
<v Speaker 5>But do you really believe that we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>attacked by country?</v>

2499
01:50:17.390 --> 01:50:22.390
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe about sending troops into </v>

2500
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.390
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in Afghanistan,</v>

2501
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:23.790
<v Speaker 5>not Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What did you think?</v>

2502
01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:25.430
<v Speaker 5>We were attacked by Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2503
01:50:25.450 --> 01:50:27.370
<v Speaker 5>but what I meant by that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this was more to this,</v>

2504
01:50:27.371 --> 01:50:32.371
<v Speaker 5>was the fact that the Taliban held bin </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ladin and shielded Bin Ladin and refused</v>

2505
01:50:33.901 --> 01:50:38.901
<v Speaker 5>to give him to us was what I felt </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened and I felt that they were,</v>

2506
01:50:39.190 --> 01:50:43.660
<v Speaker 5>they were complicit in allowing him to </v>
<v Speaker 5>operate there.</v>

2507
01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:46.150
<v Speaker 5>So while the whole country didn't attack</v>
<v Speaker 5>us,</v>

2508
01:50:46.151 --> 01:50:48.100
<v Speaker 5>I feel have they just given us bin </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ladin,</v>

2509
01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:51.360
<v Speaker 5>we never would've attacked Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a smart</v>

2510
01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:54.670
<v Speaker 1>guy and you know that the line that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get from the media,</v>

2511
01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:57.790
<v Speaker 1>the press releases or what have you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2512
01:50:57.791 --> 01:51:02.791
<v Speaker 1>it's garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why would you think that they really </v>

2513
01:51:02.791 --> 01:51:05.311
<v Speaker 1>were shielding Osama bin Ladin in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan when you know what you know </v>

2514
01:51:05.311 --> 01:51:09.661
<v Speaker 1>about Jessica Lynch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they lied about Jessica Lynch </v>

2515
01:51:09.661 --> 01:51:12.331
<v Speaker 1>being rescue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was kidnapped and meanwhile she's </v>

2516
01:51:12.331 --> 01:51:12.580
<v Speaker 1>just in a hospital in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Iraq,</v>

2517
01:51:12.610 --> 01:51:17.610
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't even fire a bullet when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they got her out of there and she </v>

2518
01:51:17.610 --> 01:51:20.731
<v Speaker 1>actually was pretty vocal about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that received death threats and </v>

2519
01:51:20.731 --> 01:51:24.061
<v Speaker 1>was threatened by numerous people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was called a trader because she </v>

2520
01:51:24.061 --> 01:51:24.880
<v Speaker 1>didn't go along with the company line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>

2521
01:51:24.881 --> 01:51:29.881
<v Speaker 1>you know the Pat Tillman story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the difference between his </v>

2522
01:51:29.881 --> 01:51:32.101
<v Speaker 1>brothers version of the events and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers version of how his son or his </v>

2523
01:51:32.101 --> 01:51:35.971
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pat Tillman felt about being in the war </v>

2524
01:51:35.971 --> 01:51:36.580
<v Speaker 1>once he was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So different from what,</v>

2525
01:51:36.650 --> 01:51:39.130
<v Speaker 1>what the government was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their press releases.</v>

2526
01:51:39.250 --> 01:51:42.040
<v Speaker 1>And then when we found out that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually friendly fire that killed him,</v>

2527
01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:43.720
<v Speaker 1>he was actually killed by American </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops.</v>

2528
01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:47.500
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing becomes incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex and really fucked up.</v>

2529
01:51:47.501 --> 01:51:52.501
<v Speaker 1>And you're realizing that someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>lying to you and they're painting a bad </v>

2530
01:51:52.501 --> 01:51:55.231
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why would you assume that they're </v>

2531
01:51:55.231 --> 01:51:57.511
<v Speaker 1>telling you the truth about Osama bin </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladin being hit by the Taliban in </v>

2532
01:51:57.511 --> 01:51:57.511
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan?</v>

2533
01:51:57.511 --> 01:51:58.720
<v Speaker 5>In that case?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believed it.</v>

2534
01:51:58.810 --> 01:52:01.500
<v Speaker 5>They have at the time you did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I still probably.</v>

2535
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:05.020
<v Speaker 5>I still think the Taliban knew he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and was happy he was there.</v>

2536
01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:06.520
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't blame them.</v>

2537
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:08.690
<v Speaker 5>That's their religious fanatics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a religious guy.</v>

2538
01:52:08.710 --> 01:52:10.180
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>

2539
01:52:10.181 --> 01:52:10.240
<v Speaker 5>Have</v>

2540
01:52:10.460 --> 01:52:11.660

<v Speaker 1>Sorry to interrupt you,</v>

2541
01:52:11.661 --> 01:52:13.340
<v Speaker 1>but have you ever talked to special </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces guys?</v>

2542

<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the guy who was killed.</v>

2545
01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot of them.</v>

2548
01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Don't think that that guy wasn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

2549
01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:28.280
<v Speaker 1>They think he had been dead a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

2550
01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:32.320
<v Speaker 1>that they just decided to use it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good time to say they got them.</v>

2551
01:52:32.610 --> 01:52:35.510
<v Speaker 1>And that Benazir Bhutto that will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was killed in a,</v>

2552
01:52:35.511 --> 01:52:37.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an explosion.</v>

2553
01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2554
01:52:38.430 --> 01:52:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Is that her name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was she the one who was shot,</v>

2555
01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:42.170
<v Speaker 1>killed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was the woman that was killed?</v>

2556
01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:44.210
<v Speaker 1>She was president or she was running for</v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

2557
01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:46.130
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

2558
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:51.130
<v Speaker 4>wish I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm such a fucking idiot when it comes </v>

2559
01:52:51.130 --> 01:52:51.130
<v Speaker 4>to foreign policy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Killed.</v>

2560
01:52:51.130 --> 01:52:51.170
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she said,</v>

2561
01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:53.450
<v Speaker 4>whoever this woman was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she said that,</v>

2562
01:52:53.451 --> 01:52:54.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2563
01:52:54.561 --> 01:52:55.790
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Benazir Bhutto.</v>

2564
01:52:56.090 --> 01:53:00.560
<v Speaker 4>She was killed in 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She said that she went to his funeral,</v>

2565
01:53:01.850 --> 01:53:04.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was a prime minister of Pakistan,</v>

2566
01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:07.100
<v Speaker 4>two consecutive term nonconsecutive </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms.</v>

2567
01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:08.380
<v Speaker 4>Which shot though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that?</v>

2568
01:53:08.381 --> 01:53:11.630
<v Speaker 4>Or was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the bar and she.</v>

2569
01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:12.890
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2570
01:53:12.891 --> 01:53:14.720
<v Speaker 4>this is not a woman that has any reason </v>
<v Speaker 4>to lie.</v>

2571
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:16.160
<v Speaker 4>She said she went to his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>funeral.</v>

2572
01:53:16.610 --> 01:53:18.470
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it was one of those fake funerals,</v>

2573
01:53:19.770 --> 01:53:21.320
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2574
01:53:21.321 --> 01:53:23.420
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or just as fucking put out.</v>

2575
01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:28.010
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they knew that bitch would tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's bring it to a fake funeral.</v>

2576
01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:33.100
<v Speaker 4>She'll talk some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We made a fake Osama bin Ladin and then </v>

2577
01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:33.320
<v Speaker 4>he can hide in Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's possible too.</v>

2578
01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:34.700
<v Speaker 4>It didn't really help Obama.</v>

2579
01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:36.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I firmly believe.</v>

2580
01:53:36.291 --> 01:53:38.420
<v Speaker 4>I do think that he was there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2581
01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:40.610
<v Speaker 4>and I do think that they just caught </v>
<v Speaker 4>them the way they said.</v>

2582
01:53:40.611 --> 01:53:42.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe everything the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government tells me at all,</v>

2583
01:53:42.650 --> 01:53:45.680
<v Speaker 4>but in this particular case it makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense to me and I,</v>

2584
01:53:45.681 --> 01:53:48.410
<v Speaker 4>it's not that difficult to stretch them </v>
<v Speaker 4>to make that.</v>

2585
01:53:48.411 --> 01:53:50.490
<v Speaker 4>He was holed up there and they finally </v>
<v Speaker 4>got it.</v>

2586
01:53:50.491 --> 01:53:52.200
<v Speaker 4>But it took 10 fucking years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2587
01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:57.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't see the government being patient</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough or anybody not wanting to grab,</v>

2588
01:53:57.081 --> 01:53:59.630
<v Speaker 4>like Bush was getting slaughtered in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2589
01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:04.720
<v Speaker 4>in the polls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way anybody would like a rip </v>

2590
01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:08.890
<v Speaker 4>on the Republican side would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed that to continue or you know </v>

2591
01:54:08.890 --> 01:54:13.141
<v Speaker 4>what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether they could have grabbed the </v>

2592
01:54:13.141 --> 01:54:13.790
<v Speaker 4>glory for it as opposed to a under </v>
<v Speaker 4>Obama's watch.</v>

2593
01:54:14.090 --> 01:54:17.270
<v Speaker 4>So do I believe that the Taliban was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it was the French government,</v>

2594
01:54:17.271 --> 01:54:18.860
<v Speaker 4>I would not have believed they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>hiding him.</v>

2595
01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:24.160
<v Speaker 4>Even Saddam Hussein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I probably wouldn't have believed and I </v>

2596
01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:26.480
<v Speaker 4>was at originally for the Iraq war and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then I'm against it.</v>

2597
01:54:26.690 --> 01:54:28.370
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't have been for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2598
01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:32.750
<v Speaker 4>but with Afghanistan I feel they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>much more religious fanatics and you see</v>

2599
01:54:32.751 --> 01:54:37.751
<v Speaker 4>the way the Taliban are and I do think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they were protecting him and they </v>

2600
01:54:37.751 --> 01:54:41.831
<v Speaker 4>were okay with him being there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was why I was okay with us </v>

2601
01:54:41.831 --> 01:54:43.050
<v Speaker 4>lashing out at them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2602
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:48.550
<v Speaker 4>Iraq was a mistake and I wish we hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>gone there because I think that most of </v>

2603
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:52.541
<v Speaker 4>the rack people don't give a fuck about </v>
<v Speaker 4>us and I don't think our American lives </v>

2604
01:54:52.541 --> 01:54:53.850
<v Speaker 4>should be shed over that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I believe in pulling,</v>

2605
01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:56.600
<v Speaker 4>get them out of Germany to Wiley and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking Germany.</v>

2606
01:54:56.601 --> 01:54:57.500
<v Speaker 4>It's a waste of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2607
01:54:57.501 --> 01:55:02.501
<v Speaker 4>But do you think that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're really in Iraq for the Iraqi </v>

2608
01:55:02.501 --> 01:55:02.501
<v Speaker 4>people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2609
01:55:02.501 --> 01:55:02.501
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course not.</v>

2610
01:55:02.501 --> 01:55:07.470
<v Speaker 4>We're in Iraq to make some money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're there to control oil then we </v>

2611
01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:08.090
<v Speaker 4>should say most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2612
01:55:08.650 --> 01:55:11.390
<v Speaker 4>You can't say that because nobody's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to agree to go to war then.</v>

2613
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:16.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's been the strategy from the </v>

2614
01:55:16.570 --> 01:55:19.030
<v Speaker 4>beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what Eisenhower warned people </v>

2615
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.820
<v Speaker 4>about when he was leaving office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what people have always said.</v>

2616
01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:21.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you ever read that?</v>

2617
01:55:21.111 --> 01:55:22.190
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2618
01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:26.630
<v Speaker 4>Smedley Butler thing he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a general in 1935.</v>

2619
01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:28.070
<v Speaker 4>He wrote both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2620
01:55:28.071 --> 01:55:31.010
<v Speaker 4>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what's kind of a famous piece?</v>

2621
01:55:31.011 --> 01:55:34.880
<v Speaker 4>It's called war is a racket and he wrote</v>
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing about his entire career</v>

2622
01:55:34.881 --> 01:55:38.930
<v Speaker 4>in the military being a racket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was all about really about money,</v>

2623
01:55:38.931 --> 01:55:43.931
<v Speaker 4>about bankers and about oil companies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and about all these different things </v>

2624
01:55:43.931 --> 01:55:44.670
<v Speaker 4>where he was really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he thought he was doing one thing,</v>

2625
01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:49.820
<v Speaker 4>but he's really just protecting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>interests of these gigantic </v>

2626
01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:49.820
<v Speaker 4>institutions.</v>

2627
01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:53.600
<v Speaker 4>And when you read it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really hard to read because it's </v>

2628
01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:56.211
<v Speaker 4>hard to wrap your head around the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that this was 1930 something and it's </v>

2629
01:55:56.211 --> 01:55:56.550
<v Speaker 4>the same now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same way now,</v>

2630
01:55:56.580 --> 01:55:59.970
<v Speaker 4>almost 100 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>18 years later.</v>

2631
01:56:00.210 --> 01:56:02.460
<v Speaker 4>And it's basically the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2632
01:56:02.461 --> 01:56:05.730
<v Speaker 4>I agree with a lot more of that than I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have five or six years ago.</v>

2633
01:56:06.610 --> 01:56:08.720
<v Speaker 4>What's changed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just just,</v>

2634
01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:10.020
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2635
01:56:10.530 --> 01:56:15.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys like Bernie madoff and all of </v>

2636
01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:17.741
<v Speaker 4>these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just growing up a little bit more or </v>

2637
01:56:17.741 --> 01:56:17.741
<v Speaker 4>looking at things differently or reading</v>
<v Speaker 4>more about,</v>

2638
01:56:17.741 --> 01:56:17.741
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just whatever,</v>

2639
01:56:17.741 --> 01:56:22.281
<v Speaker 4>whatever changes in opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And over time I've never afraid of </v>

2640
01:56:22.281 --> 01:56:22.590
<v Speaker 4>looking back and going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2641
01:56:22.591 --> 01:56:23.850
<v Speaker 4>I should have thought another way on </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2642
01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:25.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I don't.</v>

2643
01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:30.920
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't try to convince the audience </v>

2644
01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:30.920
<v Speaker 4>that I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just honest about my opinion.</v>

2645
01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:31.060
<v Speaker 4>500.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2646
01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:33.450
<v Speaker 4>you're brave with your opinions too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is important.</v>

2647
01:56:33.451 --> 01:56:34.030
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2648
01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:39.280
<v Speaker 4>if you really believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a reason for believing it and </v>

2649
01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:39.280
<v Speaker 4>you're willing to talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2650
01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:40.570
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

2651
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:42.810
<v Speaker 4>that's a rare thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't want to do that.</v>

2652
01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:45.090
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to take chances with </v>
<v Speaker 4>controversial subjects.</v>

2653
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:49.200
<v Speaker 4>It's a very controversial subject to </v>
<v Speaker 4>defend war or even criticize war.</v>

2654
01:56:49.201 --> 01:56:50.310
<v Speaker 4>It's controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2655
01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:51.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes a,</v>

2656
01:56:51.921 --> 01:56:56.010
<v Speaker 4>it becomes a topic of heated discussion </v>
<v Speaker 4>always.</v>

2657
01:56:56.580 --> 01:57:00.270
<v Speaker 4>I feel like with the Afghan government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2658
01:57:00.271 --> 01:57:00.680
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

2659
01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:02.530
<v Speaker 4>if I found out that they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>shielded,</v>

2660
01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:03.330
<v Speaker 4>been loud,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I say,</v>

2661
01:57:03.331 --> 01:57:04.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was wrong about that.</v>

2662
01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:07.920
<v Speaker 4>To really find out about the Afghan </v>
<v Speaker 4>government is that we pay the brother of</v>

2663
01:57:07.921 --> 01:57:10.500
<v Speaker 4>cars by the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a drug dealer.</v>

2664
01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:15.680
<v Speaker 4>The CIA has been paying him for almost a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking decade or something crazy like </v>

2665
01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:15.680
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2666
01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:18.300
<v Speaker 4>Have you interviewed sod any know who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a buddy of Jonathan's?</v>

2667
01:57:18.301 --> 01:57:20.340
<v Speaker 4>Although he knows everything about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's from Afghanistan.</v>

2668
01:57:20.370 --> 01:57:21.860
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>What's moby?</v>

2672

2673
01:57:28.091 --> 01:57:28.740
<v Speaker 4>it's a media company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a TV station there,</v>

2674
01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:33.860

<v Speaker 4>He knows everything about it and he </v>

2675
01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:38.751
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could tell you about the Taliban </v>

2676
01:57:38.751 --> 01:57:40.131
<v Speaker 4>because he's communicated with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knows and he's a guy you would love,</v>

2677

<v Speaker 4>a very well and he would be very </v>

<v Speaker 4>accurate and whatever he said because he</v>
<v Speaker 4>knows those guys.</v>

2681
01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:56.600
<v Speaker 4>You know what my favorite story about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Afghanistan is how they talk the Taliban</v>

2682
01:57:56.630 --> 01:57:58.840
<v Speaker 4>to giving up the position or they how </v>
<v Speaker 4>they talk,</v>

2683
01:57:58.841 --> 01:58:03.841
<v Speaker 4>the war lords,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the local guys into giving up the </v>

2684
01:58:03.841 --> 01:58:03.841
<v Speaker 4>position for the Taliban.</v>

2685
01:58:03.841 --> 01:58:04.770
<v Speaker 4>I Agora,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

2686
01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:09.840
<v Speaker 4>Given Viagara Viagra like guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need guns.</v>

2687
01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:14.760
<v Speaker 4>Plus I have 20 was then I cannot even </v>
<v Speaker 4>get it up and then they're like,</v>

2688
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:15.720
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2689
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:20.750
<v Speaker 4>we got you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the sudden he's old dudes are just </v>

2690
01:58:21.331 --> 01:58:23.480
<v Speaker 4>naked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The perpetual hard ons.</v>

2691
01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:27.590
<v Speaker 4>This running these heroines that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have up there and what would it be?</v>

2692
01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:30.890
<v Speaker 4>Barbaric way of living life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have mean they,</v>

2693
01:58:30.891 --> 01:58:33.930
<v Speaker 4>they have these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these with a lot of people don't realize</v>

2694
01:58:33.931 --> 01:58:38.931
<v Speaker 4>about Afghanistan is if you watch </v>
<v Speaker 4>documentaries on it or talk to people </v>

2695
01:58:38.931 --> 01:58:41.350
<v Speaker 4>that have been there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really is like it's frozen in time.</v>

2696
01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:45.310
<v Speaker 4>Like there's people that are warlords </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they control segments of the,</v>

2697
01:58:45.340 --> 01:58:50.340
<v Speaker 4>of the land and then there are bordered </v>
<v Speaker 4>by other warlords and these guys have </v>

2698
01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:53.460
<v Speaker 4>like 20 wives and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird wacky sort of a way of </v>

2699
01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:53.770
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fifteenth Century.</v>

2700
01:58:53.771 --> 01:58:55.080
<v Speaker 4>It feels century.</v>

2701
01:58:55.180 --> 01:59:00.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't relate to it at all and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we should be over there </v>

2702
01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:00.180
<v Speaker 4>interacting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2703
01:59:00.190 --> 01:59:02.110
<v Speaker 4>not that we should never have </v>
<v Speaker 4>interaction with the countries,</v>

2704
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:07.470
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that we try to throw our </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas into other people's business like </v>

2705
01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:13.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what North Korea does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nothing to do with me.</v>

2706
01:59:13.740 --> 01:59:18.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm all that money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We waste on fucking other countries </v>

2707
01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:21.430
<v Speaker 4>should be spent on American citizens and</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we want obamacare,</v>

2708
01:59:21.690 --> 01:59:23.380
<v Speaker 4>finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's take care of everybody.</v>

2709
01:59:23.381 --> 01:59:28.381
<v Speaker 4>Take that billion you're given to Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then fucking give it back to the </v>

2710
01:59:28.381 --> 01:59:31.831
<v Speaker 4>American people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like give people here who have their </v>

2711
01:59:31.831 --> 01:59:32.230
<v Speaker 4>fucking pensions taken away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2712
01:59:32.231 --> 01:59:37.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give them that billion dollars like </v>

2713
01:59:37.231 --> 01:59:39.570
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we waste so much money and I think </v>

2714
01:59:39.570 --> 01:59:39.570
<v Speaker 4>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

2715
01:59:39.570 --> 01:59:40.750
<v Speaker 4>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the asterisk with that should be,</v>

2716
01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:45.990
<v Speaker 4>if anybody attacks us physically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our response should be embarrassingly </v>

2717
01:59:46.450 --> 01:59:46.900
<v Speaker 4>bad.</v>

2718
01:59:47.170 --> 01:59:49.910
<v Speaker 4>Linkedin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she'd be embarrassingly strong and,</v>

2719
01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:50.360
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2720
01:59:50.361 --> 01:59:53.140
<v Speaker 4>and devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think that should be the only.</v>

2721
01:59:53.740 --> 01:59:55.420
<v Speaker 4>That should be the thing that you do </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you want,</v>

2722
01:59:55.421 --> 01:59:58.080
<v Speaker 4>but if you come into our yard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2723
01:59:58.210 --> 01:59:58.930
<v Speaker 4>we will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2724
01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:01.960
<v Speaker 4>we will blast you out of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Childish,</v>

2725
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.470
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

2726
02:00:02.970 --> 02:00:04.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm childish in a lot of ways to it,</v>

2727
02:00:04.791 --> 02:00:08.650
<v Speaker 4>but as a standup comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's ridiculous for me to try to</v>

2728
02:00:08.651 --> 02:00:10.810
<v Speaker 4>even attempt to understand what it must </v>
<v Speaker 4>be locked,</v>

2729
02:00:10.850 --> 02:00:13.710
<v Speaker 4>running foreign policy just to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>

2730
02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:14.170
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

2731
02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:19.320
<v Speaker 4>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the entirety of the </v>

2732
02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:20.500
<v Speaker 4>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would see that they would,</v>

2733
02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:23.770
<v Speaker 4>I would think that there's probably a </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefit and giving a lot of people money</v>

2734
02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:26.350
<v Speaker 4>because they make you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>indebted to you.</v>

2735
02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:29.650
<v Speaker 4>Those people are indebted to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you can kind of do things.</v>

2736
02:00:29.770 --> 02:00:31.870
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can put bases over there,</v>

2737
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:33.940
<v Speaker 4>you can extract resources,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could do all this shit.</v>

2738
02:00:33.941 --> 02:00:35.060
<v Speaker 4>The United States does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2739
02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:39.400
<v Speaker 4>And we can't do all that if we don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>give the money and if we don't give them</v>

2740
02:00:39.401 --> 02:00:44.401
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they all start fucking forming </v>

2741
02:00:44.401 --> 02:00:45.730
<v Speaker 4>their own organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's not one world power anymore.</v>

2742
02:00:45.731 --> 02:00:50.731
<v Speaker 4>Like it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the reason why one world power </v>

2743
02:00:50.731 --> 02:00:52.981
<v Speaker 4>works is because we put the whole world </v>
<v Speaker 4>into sort of a perpetual welfare state </v>

2744
02:00:52.981 --> 02:00:56.940
<v Speaker 4>where the whole world relies on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>United States either for military </v>

2745
02:00:56.940 --> 02:00:58.150
<v Speaker 4>support or from financial support or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

2746
02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:00.650
<v Speaker 4>And by doing that you kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2747
02:01:00.710 --> 02:01:03.160
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a terrible way of looking at it.</v>

2748
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:06.340
<v Speaker 4>But the reality is when you have these </v>
<v Speaker 4>countries that are indebted to you,</v>

2749
02:01:06.341 --> 02:01:07.700
<v Speaker 4>those countries kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh you,</v>

2750
02:01:07.930 --> 02:01:11.350
<v Speaker 4>you can get them to do shit and stay </v>
<v Speaker 4>calm and they don't try to take over the</v>

2751
02:01:11.351 --> 02:01:11.770
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

2752
02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:13.000
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they oh fuck,</v>

2753
02:01:13.001 --> 02:01:18.001
<v Speaker 4>load of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have military bases there and you </v>

2754
02:01:18.001 --> 02:01:18.001
<v Speaker 4>keep things on that level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when,</v>

2755
02:01:18.001 --> 02:01:21.460
<v Speaker 4>when you tell people how many bases the </v>
<v Speaker 4>United States has in other countries,</v>

2756
02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:26.520
<v Speaker 4>most people have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's more than a hundred different </v>

2757
02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:28.570
<v Speaker 4>countries in the world that have United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States military presence.</v>

2758
02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:30.490
<v Speaker 4>Like when you hear about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll go,</v>

2759
02:01:30.491 --> 02:01:33.000
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we,</v>

2760
02:01:33.220 --> 02:01:34.510
<v Speaker 4>this is what I love about us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

2761
02:01:34.511 --> 02:01:35.650
<v Speaker 4>I love America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>

2762
02:01:35.651 --> 02:01:40.651
<v Speaker 4>And I do think we're a great country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they talk about American </v>

2763
02:01:40.651 --> 02:01:40.651
<v Speaker 4>exceptionalism and believe a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And some</v>

2764
02:01:40.651 --> 02:01:41.930
<v Speaker 5>of it I think is a bit overblown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

2765
02:01:41.931 --> 02:01:46.931
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have patriotism and pride and you </v>

2766
02:01:46.931 --> 02:01:46.931
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not about me.</v>

2767
02:01:46.931 --> 02:01:51.100
<v Speaker 5>Oh Fuck America at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just hate the hip because the same </v>

2768
02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:52.520
<v Speaker 5>mentality that got do as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not as I do,</v>

2769
02:01:52.540 --> 02:01:57.540
<v Speaker 5>Shit trickles down into our daily lives </v>
<v Speaker 5>and eventually effects us as comics and </v>

2770
02:01:57.540 --> 02:02:01.961
<v Speaker 5>performers because the people feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>comfortable being self righteous are </v>

2771
02:02:01.961 --> 02:02:02.390
<v Speaker 5>duplicitous and it makes me fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>

2772
02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:04.580
<v Speaker 5>But like we're bellyaching about </v>
<v Speaker 5>snowden.</v>

2773
02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:09.760
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck do we think the Soviets </v>

2774
02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:12.011
<v Speaker 5>are going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have had our door open to Soviet </v>

2775
02:02:12.011 --> 02:02:14.930
<v Speaker 5>defectors forever and we cry that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're keeping him.</v>

2776
02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:19.010
<v Speaker 5>Of course they should keep him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't blame the Soviets for not giving</v>

2777
02:02:19.011 --> 02:02:24.011
<v Speaker 5>him back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to huff and puff when all </v>

2778
02:02:24.011 --> 02:02:24.011
<v Speaker 5>we've done is say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2779
02:02:24.011 --> 02:02:28.000
<v Speaker 5>if you're a defect or come on over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll take care of you and we should do </v>

2780
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:28.000
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>

2781
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.220
<v Speaker 5>do you know what the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the critical boiling</v>

2782
02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:31.960
<v Speaker 1>point was when they decided to accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

2783
02:02:31.961 --> 02:02:34.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his acceptance for his,</v>

2784

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2786
02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Can Stumble through that quick enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States was criticizing Russia</v>

2787
02:02:42.821 --> 02:02:46.750
<v Speaker 1>for trying to silence political dissent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>

2788
02:02:46.810 --> 02:02:50.380

<v Speaker 1>criticize Russia for silencing political</v>

2789
02:02:50.381 --> 02:02:55.381
<v Speaker 1>dissent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the biggest whistleblower in the </v>

2790
02:02:55.381 --> 02:02:58.480
<v Speaker 1>history of our country is sitting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their airport and they were like,</v>

2796
02:03:07.140 --> 02:03:12.140
<v Speaker 1>You guys that arrogant that you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can criticize us while we're </v>

2797
02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:15.451
<v Speaker 1>holding the guy that fucking released </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those documents that prove that you </v>

2798
02:03:15.451 --> 02:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>guys are lying twats yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the government,</v>

2799
02:03:16.271 --> 02:03:21.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean he went on Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went on the tonight show with Jay Leno </v>

2800
02:03:21.271 --> 02:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>and was lying about it.</v>

2801
02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't telling the truth about releasing</v>

2802
02:03:24.641 --> 02:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2803
02:03:25.991 --> 02:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>he was saying that people are not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>spied on,</v>

2804
02:03:28.451 --> 02:03:33.451
<v Speaker 1>but that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are being spied on and they're </v>

2805
02:03:33.451 --> 02:03:36.151
<v Speaker 1>telling the dea to there showing them </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to fake a investigation so that they</v>

2806
02:03:37.631 --> 02:03:42.631
<v Speaker 1>don't show that they got the records </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the NSA there showing them how to </v>

2807
02:03:42.631 --> 02:03:44.930
<v Speaker 1>retroactively piece together an </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigation investigation.</v>

2808
02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:45.580
<v Speaker 1>So they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2809
02:03:45.581 --> 02:03:47.620
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we arrived at our results this way.</v>

2810
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:51.070
<v Speaker 1>If you already know someones guilty </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have the NSA,</v>

2811
02:03:51.071 --> 02:03:52.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paperwork on them,</v>

2812
02:03:52.900 --> 02:03:54.280
<v Speaker 1>email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone calls,</v>

2813
02:03:54.281 --> 02:03:59.281
<v Speaker 1>what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is zoom in on this </v>

2814
02:03:59.281 --> 02:04:01.580
<v Speaker 1>guy and then you could find the evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and find a reason to,</v>

2815
02:04:01.950 --> 02:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>to investigate him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

2816
02:04:03.671 --> 02:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>he's guilty already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just piece it together easily</v>

2817
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:10.750
<v Speaker 5>and again on where are they doing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>to American citizens for normal </v>

2818
02:04:10.750 --> 02:04:15.201
<v Speaker 5>interactions or was it really for people</v>
<v Speaker 5>who were using the a loophole of being </v>

2819
02:04:17.761 --> 02:04:20.450
<v Speaker 5>here and communicating so we couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>get into like we're the.</v>

2820
02:04:20.460 --> 02:04:22.270
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like somebody once said </v>
<v Speaker 5>after 9:11</v>

2821
02:04:22.271 --> 02:04:24.420
<v Speaker 5>this the constitution is on a suicide </v>
<v Speaker 5>pact.</v>

2822
02:04:24.810 --> 02:04:27.300
<v Speaker 5>Like were they attempting to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

2823
02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:32.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the answer to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Were they attempting to use like a </v>

2824
02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:32.880
<v Speaker 5>America's law is kind of against it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2825
02:04:32.881 --> 02:04:34.540
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was American consistency</v>

2826
02:04:34.580 --> 02:04:39.580
<v Speaker 1>using the dea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dea was investigating citizens for </v>

2827
02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:39.580
<v Speaker 1>selling drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always draw the.</v>

2828
02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do as you were saying that.</v>

2829
02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as I know,</v>

2830
02:04:41.191 --> 02:04:43.460
<v Speaker 1>it's American citizens and believe so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go to the store.</v>

2831
02:04:43.510 --> 02:04:45.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want this to that.</v>

2832
02:04:45.091 --> 02:04:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to use not just that.</v>

2833
02:04:46.650 --> 02:04:51.650
<v Speaker 1>The real problem with is not just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact they're catching people doing </v>

2834
02:04:51.650 --> 02:04:51.650
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for you.</v>

2835
02:04:51.650 --> 02:04:52.530
<v Speaker 1>Removing meth labs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>

2836
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:56.820
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you're also asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigators to fake an investigation,</v>

2837
02:04:57.030 --> 02:05:00.420
<v Speaker 1>and when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're asking public servants to lie and</v>

2838
02:05:00.421 --> 02:05:03.900
<v Speaker 1>you're asking people that are in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>noble position,</v>

2839
02:05:03.901 --> 02:05:08.901
<v Speaker 1>the position of law enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually asking them to behave </v>

2840
02:05:08.901 --> 02:05:08.970
<v Speaker 1>unethically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what the fucking laws are,</v>

2841
02:05:09.210 --> 02:05:14.210
<v Speaker 1>and you know if you catch someone doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and you don't want to reveal </v>

2842
02:05:14.210 --> 02:05:16.200
<v Speaker 1>the message in what you caught them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you think it's okay to lie.</v>

2843
02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a slippery goddamn slowly </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets real slippery.</v>

2844
02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:23.290
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking an investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else are you fake and what I mean?</v>

2845
02:05:23.340 --> 02:05:26.280
<v Speaker 1>That opens the door to you faking </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence that opens the door to you.</v>

2846
02:05:26.281 --> 02:05:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Faking a lot of shit if you think that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person is is,</v>

2847
02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:32.250
<v Speaker 1>is guilty if you can't prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's always been what said.</v>

2848
02:05:32.251 --> 02:05:37.251
<v Speaker 1>That's how Oj got off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole mark furhman thing that </v>

2849
02:05:37.251 --> 02:05:37.251
<v Speaker 1>he might have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People said,</v>

2850
02:05:37.251 --> 02:05:38.310
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be fucking planting evidence.</v>

2851
02:05:38.311 --> 02:05:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of.</v>

2852
02:05:39.181 --> 02:05:41.010
<v Speaker 1>That shit is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see it all the time.</v>

2853
02:05:41.011 --> 02:05:46.011
<v Speaker 1>There's a million videos on youtube of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cops that got busted planting things or </v>

2854
02:05:46.011 --> 02:05:47.040
<v Speaker 1>stories online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get busted.</v>

2855
02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:52.160
<v Speaker 1>So that sort of mentality is extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and that's why I'm against it </v>

2856
02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:53.210
<v Speaker 1>and that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2857
02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm against it for is basically a </v>

2858
02:05:58.220 --> 02:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>perverse reason.</v>

2859
02:05:58.220 --> 02:06:01.860
<v Speaker 1>It is just simply a dislike of this nosy</v>
<v Speaker 1>con culture we have become and it makes </v>

2860
02:06:02.581 --> 02:06:04.240
<v Speaker 1>me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

2861
02:06:04.241 --> 02:06:08.640
<v Speaker 1>I like to see people getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I like to see people going,</v>

2862
02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:10.740
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's me,</v>

2863
02:06:10.741 --> 02:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2864
02:06:12.150 --> 02:06:13.530
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone could sit down and go,</v>

2865
02:06:13.531 --> 02:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

2866
02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Of course I understand the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the government doing it and us </v>

2867
02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:20.380
<v Speaker 1>looking at tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course I get that.</v>

2868
02:06:20.490 --> 02:06:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2869
02:06:20.821 --> 02:06:25.821
<v Speaker 1>sociologists have an interesting take on</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on and it's as far as our </v>

2870
02:06:25.821 --> 02:06:28.950
<v Speaker 1>attraction to gossip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gossip magazines and tmz type things and</v>

2871
02:06:28.951 --> 02:06:31.980
<v Speaker 1>celebrity gossip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they're saying is that we're in</v>

2872
02:06:31.981 --> 02:06:36.090
<v Speaker 1>a weird point in time where we have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>largest populations,</v>

2873
02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:39.300
<v Speaker 1>big giant populations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know each other anymore.</v>

2874
02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:42.240
<v Speaker 1>You mean you live in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live in an apartment building,</v>

2875
02:06:42.241 --> 02:06:47.241
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people live in your apartment </v>

2876
02:06:47.241 --> 02:06:47.241
<v Speaker 1>building?</v>

2877
02:06:47.241 --> 02:06:47.241
<v Speaker 1>40 five stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

2878
02:06:47.241 --> 02:06:49.990
<v Speaker 1>40 five stories of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many is that?</v>

2879
02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:52.470
<v Speaker 1>7,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>500.</v>

2880
02:06:52.471 --> 02:06:57.471
<v Speaker 1>A thousand maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know how some people will </v>

2881
02:06:57.471 --> 02:06:57.471
<v Speaker 1>think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about what a big neighborhood that</v>

2882
02:06:57.471 --> 02:06:58.590
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a massive neighborhood.</v>

2883
02:06:58.710 --> 02:07:00.540
<v Speaker 1>How many people in that fucking building</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know?</v>

2884
02:07:00.750 --> 02:07:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Literally my neighbor and a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe two.</v>

2885
02:07:03.090 --> 02:07:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's craziness.</v>

2886
02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:09.680
<v Speaker 1>So they're saying that we're missing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>need for a community and we're missing.</v>

2887
02:07:10.290 --> 02:07:15.290
<v Speaker 1>There's like a draw of like busy body </v>
<v Speaker 1>about each other like finding what the </v>

2888
02:07:15.290 --> 02:07:19.731
<v Speaker 1>cultural parameters and boundaries are </v>
<v Speaker 1>and establishing them by talking about </v>

2889
02:07:19.731 --> 02:07:23.751
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And normally there would be like a </v>

2890
02:07:23.751 --> 02:07:23.940
<v Speaker 1>village and everybody in the village,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like 50 a hundred people.</v>

2891
02:07:23.941 --> 02:07:28.941
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we would all kind of know each </v>

2892
02:07:28.941 --> 02:07:28.941
<v Speaker 1>other's business and figure out what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool and what's not cool.</v>

2893
02:07:28.941 --> 02:07:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're in this weird situation </v>

2894
02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:33.600
<v Speaker 1>where you don't even know the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you and then you're watching,</v>

2895
02:07:33.601 --> 02:07:36.460
<v Speaker 1>keeping up with the Kardashians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fills the void</v>

2896
02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:41.460
<v Speaker 4>where community should be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why people are so God damn </v>

2897
02:07:41.460 --> 02:07:44.731
<v Speaker 4>attracted to quote unquote reality shows</v>
<v Speaker 4>as opposed to scripted shows because </v>

2898
02:07:44.731 --> 02:07:46.180
<v Speaker 4>they know when someone's being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dickhead,</v>

2899
02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:48.640
<v Speaker 4>there's no script to just be in a decade</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>

2900
02:07:48.641 --> 02:07:51.150
<v Speaker 4>oh that bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe she said that to him and</v>

2901
02:07:51.420 --> 02:07:56.420
<v Speaker 4>they're really drawn into it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're lacking like a real community </v>

2902
02:07:56.420 --> 02:08:00.331
<v Speaker 4>and a real established like group of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that you interact with on a </v>

2903
02:08:00.331 --> 02:08:04.261
<v Speaker 4>regular basis all the time and you in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your village and Plus Network tv did it </v>

2904
02:08:04.261 --> 02:08:08.601
<v Speaker 4>to themselves by emasculating comedies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and language and making everything so </v>

2905
02:08:08.601 --> 02:08:12.811
<v Speaker 4>soft and wrapped up and palatable that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it be that reality now stands out so </v>

2906
02:08:12.811 --> 02:08:17.551
<v Speaker 4>much more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Part of that is a lot of extra what </v>

2907
02:08:17.551 --> 02:08:20.341
<v Speaker 4>you're saying and some of it is because </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the writing on regular television is </v>

2908
02:08:20.341 --> 02:08:20.500
<v Speaker 4>so soft and that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not.</v>

2909
02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:24.160
<v Speaker 4>The writers are probably very good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just such fucking predictable.</v>

2910
02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:26.980
<v Speaker 4>Dereck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of it is such shit.</v>

2911
02:08:27.130 --> 02:08:28.870
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of comms,</v>

2912
02:08:28.871 --> 02:08:31.960
<v Speaker 4>especially that's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no honest language.</v>

2913
02:08:31.961 --> 02:08:33.810
<v Speaker 4>There's no honest interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2914
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:36.790
<v Speaker 4>everything is presented in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2915
02:08:36.791 --> 02:08:41.791
<v Speaker 4>is going to be presented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen the ads for the new </v>

2916
02:08:41.791 --> 02:08:42.190
<v Speaker 4>jackass movie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bad grandpa?</v>

2917
02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:43.540

2918
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:45.460
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's a film they did were they made up </v>
<v Speaker 4>these scenarios and did all these little</v>

2922
02:08:55.211 --> 02:09:00.211
<v Speaker 4>stunts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they did them in front of real </v>

2923
02:09:00.211 --> 02:09:02.431
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people had no idea why it was going </v>

<v Speaker 7>time.</v>

2929
02:09:24.090 --> 02:09:25.920
<v Speaker 7>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What</v>

2930
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:30.560

2944
02:10:41.090 --> 02:10:42.590
<v Speaker 7>We just never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's different.</v>

2945
02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:06.650
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to tell people who are </v>
<v Speaker 6>listening to this,</v>

2946
02:11:06.651 --> 02:11:11.651
<v Speaker 6>what's happening because I could </v>
<v Speaker 6>probably get in trouble for describing </v>

2947
02:11:11.651 --> 02:11:12.260
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at the graph.</v>

2948
02:11:13.460 --> 02:11:15.400
<v Speaker 4>Made it rain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking funny.</v>

2949
02:11:15.530 --> 02:11:17.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch it on Youtube.</v>

2950
02:11:17.511 --> 02:11:19.570
<v Speaker 4>Why Watch the that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>

2951
02:11:19.571 --> 02:11:24.571
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what they did was instead of making </v>

2952
02:11:24.571 --> 02:11:24.571
<v Speaker 4>just another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Am I on?</v>

2953
02:11:24.571 --> 02:11:29.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they did was instead of making </v>

2954
02:11:29.130 --> 02:11:30.811
<v Speaker 4>another goofy comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they made a hilarious thing where they </v>

2955
02:11:30.811 --> 02:11:31.720
<v Speaker 4>did it in front of people and the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>had no idea.</v>

2956
02:11:31.721 --> 02:11:36.721
<v Speaker 4>So it is like a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do have like a boar at sort of a </v>

2957
02:11:36.721 --> 02:11:38.400
<v Speaker 4>situation where they use real people as </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're filling them.</v>

2958
02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:43.840
<v Speaker 4>So great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to have to do shit like </v>

2959
02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:43.840
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>over again,</v>

2961
02:11:44.231 --> 02:11:49.231
<v Speaker 4>like I haven't been to a comedy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>quite awhile it's been awhile since I </v>

2962
02:11:49.231 --> 02:11:50.830
<v Speaker 4>saw like an actual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sit,</v>

2963
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:52.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of those movies,</v>

2964
02:11:52.980 --> 02:11:54.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>date movies or whatever.</v>

2965
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:55.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2966
02:11:55.420 --> 02:11:56.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

2967
02:11:56.561 --> 02:11:59.710
<v Speaker 4>I know what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're both going to get together in the</v>

2968
02:11:59.710 --> 02:12:01.030
<v Speaker 4>end and everything's going to be funny </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Yay,</v>

2969
02:12:01.031 --> 02:12:03.640
<v Speaker 4>ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm tired of it.</v>

2970
02:12:03.970 --> 02:12:08.970
<v Speaker 4>And everybody's tired of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why something like this comes </v>

2971
02:12:08.970 --> 02:12:08.970
<v Speaker 4>along and it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

2972
02:12:08.970 --> 02:12:09.550
<v Speaker 4>It feels different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a great idea.</v>

2973
02:12:09.610 --> 02:12:14.610
<v Speaker 4>It hits you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it catches you off guard the way comedy </v>

2974
02:12:14.610 --> 02:12:14.610
<v Speaker 4>is supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where the film is supposed to.</v>

2975
02:12:14.610 --> 02:12:14.730
<v Speaker 4>It feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2976
02:12:14.740 --> 02:12:15.970
<v Speaker 4>this is fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you,</v>

2977
02:12:15.971 --> 02:12:16.970
<v Speaker 4>what did you see?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boron?</v>

2978
02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:18.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never saw it.</v>

2979
02:12:18.701 --> 02:12:21.610
<v Speaker 4>I saw parts of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you how dare you.</v>

2980
02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:23.440
<v Speaker 4>Did see a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't love it.</v>

2981
02:12:23.470 --> 02:12:24.760
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you why,</v>

2982
02:12:25.060 --> 02:12:30.060
<v Speaker 4>because I love the allergy show so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like the parts of it were </v>

2983
02:12:30.060 --> 02:12:30.380
<v Speaker 4>scripted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2984
02:12:30.670 --> 02:12:35.670
<v Speaker 4>I liked the g,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the allergy show where I believe it was </v>

2985
02:12:35.670 --> 02:12:38.191
<v Speaker 4>all real people and I didn't like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that a lot of it was scripted in </v>

2986
02:12:38.191 --> 02:12:38.191
<v Speaker 4>Bora.</v>

2987
02:12:38.191 --> 02:12:38.191
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think it stunk,</v>

2988
02:12:38.191 --> 02:12:39.910
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really do much for me,</v>

2989
02:12:40.090 --> 02:12:42.640
<v Speaker 4>but they kind of had to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2990
02:12:43.300 --> 02:12:45.430
<v Speaker 4>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were some very funny moments where</v>

2991
02:12:45.431 --> 02:12:50.431
<v Speaker 4>it brings the bag of shit down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a lot of stuff that really </v>

2992
02:12:50.431 --> 02:12:50.431
<v Speaker 4>made me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2993
02:12:50.431 --> 02:12:50.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2994
02:12:50.441 --> 02:12:51.890
<v Speaker 4>it was amazing man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2995
02:12:52.030 --> 02:12:57.030
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that kind of comedy more than </v>

2996
02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:57.030
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His show,</v>

2997
02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:57.670
<v Speaker 4>the leg show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people today don't even</v>

2998
02:12:57.671 --> 02:13:02.671
<v Speaker 4>know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if he's going into hiding so </v>

2999
02:13:02.671 --> 02:13:02.671
<v Speaker 4>that he can do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3000
02:13:02.671 --> 02:13:06.460
<v Speaker 4>because it's really almost like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>show will never be erased from the.</v>

3001
02:13:06.570 --> 02:13:11.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no way in this day and age you </v>

3002
02:13:11.570 --> 02:13:11.570
<v Speaker 4>could sneak that pass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The publicist,</v>

3003
02:13:11.570 --> 02:13:12.420
<v Speaker 4>he needs another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He needs another character.</v>

3004
02:13:12.450 --> 02:13:17.450
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the character that no one has seen </v>

3005
02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:17.450
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it would not just have to be another</v>

3006
02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:20.911
<v Speaker 4>character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd almost have to be another person </v>

3007
02:13:20.911 --> 02:13:20.911
<v Speaker 4>because it's too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too the Internet.</v>

3008
02:13:20.911 --> 02:13:22.900
<v Speaker 4>It's too goddamn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too much information about.</v>

3009
02:13:22.930 --> 02:13:24.850
<v Speaker 4>Will you shoot them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot them all first.</v>

3010
02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:26.470
<v Speaker 4>You shoot them all and then you show </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

3011
02:13:26.471 --> 02:13:28.690
<v Speaker 4>You don't shoot them week to week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can definitely do that.</v>

3012
02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:30.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to do like one season,</v>

3013
02:13:30.161 --> 02:13:30.940
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot.</v>

3014
02:13:31.110 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 4>TV production.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Consider</v>

3015
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:34.200
<v Speaker 5>I can't get shit on the air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

3016
02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:36.510
<v Speaker 5>Fucking pontificating waiver and Lucky </v>
<v Speaker 5>Louie.</v>

3017
02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:42.800
<v Speaker 5>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody else does something and I just </v>

3018
02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:42.800
<v Speaker 5>come along for the ride.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking I'll be riding shotgun.</v>

3019
02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:43.780
<v Speaker 5>My name should be your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3020
02:13:43.781 --> 02:13:45.090
<v Speaker 5>your thing that you're doing at </v>
<v Speaker 5>scripted.</v>

3021
02:13:45.091 --> 02:13:46.410
<v Speaker 5>Is this something that you created </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself?</v>

3022
02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:48.800
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's a sitcom or Wednesday.</v>

3023
02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:54.080
<v Speaker 5>It's like a single camera comedy about </v>
<v Speaker 5>me being a comic and a sex addict and I </v>

3024
02:13:55.070 --> 02:13:56.930
<v Speaker 5>think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's funny and uh,</v>

3025
02:13:57.150 --> 02:13:59.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like nine episodes written.</v>

3026
02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:00.780
<v Speaker 5>Who are you going to bring it to?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3027
02:14:00.781 --> 02:14:02.790
<v Speaker 5>I've brought it to a few different </v>
<v Speaker 5>networks and they liked it,</v>

3028
02:14:02.791 --> 02:14:04.280
<v Speaker 5>but the problem was that Louise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a comedian,</v>

3029
02:14:04.281 --> 02:14:04.620
<v Speaker 5>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3030
02:14:04.621 --> 02:14:05.370
<v Speaker 5>we don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could lose,</v>

3031
02:14:05.550 --> 02:14:10.550
<v Speaker 5>which I get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I changed it to being a radio show </v>

3032
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:11.070
<v Speaker 5>host,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I actually like a lot better.</v>

3033
02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:14.550
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I've just been kind of frazzled with</v>

3034
02:14:14.551 --> 02:14:15.950
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just haven't done anything with it.</v>

3035
02:14:15.951 --> 02:14:17.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>

3036
02:14:17.281 --> 02:14:18.660
<v Speaker 5>What's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

3037
02:14:18.670 --> 02:14:19.590
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3038
02:14:19.890 --> 02:14:22.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't get this stuff done.</v>

3039
02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:25.110
<v Speaker 5>Like I should get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a manager,</v>

3040
02:14:25.230 --> 02:14:27.980
<v Speaker 5>I have a personal appearance agent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't have an agent and uh,</v>

3041
02:14:28.020 --> 02:14:30.330
<v Speaker 5>we get as much done as we can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you have an agent?</v>

3042
02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:32.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a good question.</v>

3043
02:14:33.330 --> 02:14:35.190
<v Speaker 5>He's so logical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but other aspects of your life?</v>

3044
02:14:35.450 --> 02:14:36.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's see.</v>

3045

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

3046
02:14:36.511 --> 02:14:41.511
<v Speaker 5>can I zone out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I'm just fucking online being </v>

3047
02:14:41.511 --> 02:14:44.871
<v Speaker 5>a creep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And how much of your time was spent </v>

3048
02:14:44.871 --> 02:14:46.380
<v Speaker 5>being a sex addict?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much of your daily?</v>

3049
02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:48.650
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to say when I'm doing good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing good.</v>

3050
02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:51.060
<v Speaker 5>When I'm doing bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's been times where literally I get</v>

3051
02:14:51.061 --> 02:14:54.120
<v Speaker 5>home from Radio at 11 and then all of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>sudden it's like,</v>

3052
02:14:54.121 --> 02:14:55.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've eaten and stuff,</v>

3053
02:14:55.171 --> 02:14:55.580
<v Speaker 5>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3054
02:14:55.581 --> 02:14:56.070
<v Speaker 5>it's 8:30.</v>

3055
02:14:56.070 --> 02:14:58.860
<v Speaker 5>I gotta go to work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the whole day was wasted.</v>

3056
02:14:58.890 --> 02:15:01.470
<v Speaker 5>It's like so many of those days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like being in a fog.</v>

3057
02:15:01.770 --> 02:15:06.770
<v Speaker 5>Plus I don't sleep at all really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm always tired because I fucking dumb </v>

3058
02:15:06.770 --> 02:15:07.470
<v Speaker 5>sleep apnea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you didn't,</v>

3059
02:15:07.471 --> 02:15:08.880
<v Speaker 5>you haven't done anything with your </v>
<v Speaker 5>sleep apnea?</v>

3060
02:15:08.881 --> 02:15:11.910
<v Speaker 5>I've done two tests.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm literally,</v>

3061
02:15:11.911 --> 02:15:15.750
<v Speaker 5>the only thing worse than a pedophile is</v>
<v Speaker 5>a fucking sleep apnea test technician.</v>

3062
02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:17.820
<v Speaker 5>Those fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3063
02:15:17.821 --> 02:15:21.870
<v Speaker 5>I knew what I needed and I'll never </v>
<v Speaker 5>forgive the woman for not testing me for</v>

3064
02:15:21.871 --> 02:15:23.820
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need an asv machine which,</v>

3065
02:15:23.940 --> 02:15:27.810
<v Speaker 5>which handles complex apnea and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm finally going in for a test with the</v>

3066
02:15:27.811 --> 02:15:30.090
<v Speaker 5>new company probably within the next few</v>
<v Speaker 5>weeks,</v>

3067
02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:32.750
<v Speaker 5>but I need a mask that fits me properly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3068
02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:37.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need a custom made mask and there was </v>

3069
02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:38.430
<v Speaker 5>a place that did him in Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I can't find them anymore.</v>

3070
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:40.170
<v Speaker 5>You lost weight?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3071
02:15:40.171 --> 02:15:40.800
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did.</v>

3072
02:15:40.830 --> 02:15:43.980
<v Speaker 5>Did that make an impact on your sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't that,</v>

3073
02:15:43.981 --> 02:15:45.750
<v Speaker 5>it might've made,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might've made the,</v>

3074
02:15:45.751 --> 02:15:47.370
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3075
02:15:47.371 --> 02:15:49.560
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obstructive apnea a bit different,</v>

3076
02:15:49.590 --> 02:15:52.410
<v Speaker 5>which is when your throat closed up </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of your tongue blocking it.</v>

3077
02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:53.030
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3078
02:15:53.110 --> 02:15:58.110
<v Speaker 5>the central apnea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it affected by weight at </v>

3079
02:15:58.110 --> 02:16:00.921
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the difference when your brain </v>

3080
02:16:00.921 --> 02:16:00.921
<v Speaker 5>just doesn't say breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that's what's going on with you and</v>

3081
02:16:00.921 --> 02:16:05.701
<v Speaker 5>I both complex like obstructive is your.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll lay there on my back and my tongue </v>

3082
02:16:05.701 --> 02:16:06.600
<v Speaker 5>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3083
02:16:06.650 --> 02:16:11.650
<v Speaker 5>let's make that horrible sound.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then there's times where I'm laying </v>

3084
02:16:11.650 --> 02:16:14.331
<v Speaker 5>on my side and I'll just go and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>wake up and I'll realize I haven't </v>

3085
02:16:16.921 --> 02:16:19.380
<v Speaker 5>breathed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My Body didn't try to breathe.</v>

3086
02:16:19.410 --> 02:16:24.410
<v Speaker 5>So what happens is I wake up with an </v>
<v Speaker 5>intense itch somewhere like in my neck </v>

3087
02:16:24.410 --> 02:16:26.320
<v Speaker 5>or my stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or I have to piss or I wake up like,</v>

3088
02:16:27.150 --> 02:16:30.790
<v Speaker 5>because your brain sends adrenaline to </v>
<v Speaker 5>your heart to wake you up because you're</v>

3089
02:16:30.791 --> 02:16:31.360
<v Speaker 5>not breathing.</v>

3090
02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:36.660
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what is the cause of that </v>

3091
02:16:36.660 --> 02:16:37.570
<v Speaker 5>oxygenation of the blood?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something off with that.</v>

3092
02:16:37.860 --> 02:16:39.280
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't know completely.</v>

3093
02:16:39.690 --> 02:16:43.750
<v Speaker 5>The central apnea is a newer one that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're addressing obstructive,</v>

3094
02:16:43.751 --> 02:16:48.751
<v Speaker 5>they've done a lot with at a central </v>
<v Speaker 5>apnea they don't know as much about and </v>

3095
02:16:48.751 --> 02:16:48.751
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the masks are okay,</v>

3096
02:16:48.850 --> 02:16:50.950
<v Speaker 5>but it's hard to find a mass that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>totally comfortable with,</v>

3097
02:16:51.430 --> 02:16:51.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because,</v>

3098
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:52.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3099
02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:53.160
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3100
02:16:53.710 --> 02:16:58.710
<v Speaker 5>for the asv machines are very advanced </v>
<v Speaker 5>machine and it monitors your breathing </v>

3101
02:16:58.710 --> 02:17:00.280
<v Speaker 5>and when I'm not attempting to take a </v>
<v Speaker 5>breath,</v>

3102
02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:03.390
<v Speaker 5>it will do it for me and it will force </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Aaron,</v>

3103
02:17:03.460 --> 02:17:06.280
<v Speaker 5>whereas most cpap machines just are </v>
<v Speaker 5>patterned.</v>

3104
02:17:06.740 --> 02:17:09.270
<v Speaker 5>Shh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shh.</v>

3105
02:17:10.170 --> 02:17:15.170
<v Speaker 5>They're kind of patterning your </v>
<v Speaker 5>breathing just to keep your throat open </v>

3106
02:17:15.170 --> 02:17:15.170
<v Speaker 5>so your tongue doesn't block it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

3107
02:17:15.170 --> 02:17:16.270
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the breathing.</v>

3108
02:17:16.630 --> 02:17:21.630
<v Speaker 5>So this asb machine has to do that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it has to calculate when your brain </v>

3109
02:17:21.630 --> 02:17:21.630
<v Speaker 5>isn't trying to breathe.</v>

3110
02:17:21.630 --> 02:17:26.280
<v Speaker 5>It's really fucking weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>frustrating situation because I'm an </v>

3111
02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:27.940
<v Speaker 5>insomniac anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I can't fall asleep with the mask.</v>

3112
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:33.150
<v Speaker 5>Do you think any of this has to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there any psychological things going </v>

3113
02:17:33.150 --> 02:17:33.420
<v Speaker 5>on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure some of it,</v>

3114
02:17:33.421 --> 02:17:37.900
<v Speaker 5>the falling asleep part is like when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>acting out sexually,</v>

3115
02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:42.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't sleep as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if I'm sharing to you off the </v>

3116
02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:42.960
<v Speaker 5>videos right before it fucks my mind up </v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3117
02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:47.310
<v Speaker 5>like when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I'm off sex shit for a week or so </v>

3118
02:17:47.310 --> 02:17:47.310
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not jacking off and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 5>obsessing.</v>

3119
02:17:47.310 --> 02:17:51.660
<v Speaker 5>It's like my brain goes and I can </v>
<v Speaker 5>breathe and think normally and live </v>

3120
02:17:51.881 --> 02:17:54.430
<v Speaker 5>normally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when I am constantly fucking getting</v>

3121
02:17:54.431 --> 02:17:57.730
<v Speaker 5>that dopamine drip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I literally was recently.</v>

3122
02:17:57.940 --> 02:18:00.190
<v Speaker 5>I kept jerking off before sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I wasn't coming.</v>

3123
02:18:00.430 --> 02:18:01.420
<v Speaker 5>I was just getting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would add too,</v>

3124
02:18:01.421 --> 02:18:03.780
<v Speaker 5>I get myself clothes and then stop and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then get myself clothes.</v>

3125
02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:06.670
<v Speaker 5>And I realized this the other night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel high,</v>

3126
02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:12.360
<v Speaker 5>like I'm getting myself fucking high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm like a chimp or a fucking a </v>

3127
02:18:12.590 --> 02:18:15.640
<v Speaker 5>journal going for a little fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just,</v>

3128
02:18:15.641 --> 02:18:18.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm going for this high feeling and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can sleep.</v>

3129
02:18:18.761 --> 02:18:20.500
<v Speaker 5>It's sickening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long have you had this issue?</v>

3130
02:18:20.530 --> 02:18:22.390
<v Speaker 5>My whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's been before I drank,</v>

3131
02:18:22.391 --> 02:18:24.430
<v Speaker 5>long before I did drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was this.</v>

3132
02:18:24.610 --> 02:18:25.300
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3133
02:18:25.630 --> 02:18:26.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sexual shit,</v>

3134
02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:29.770
<v Speaker 5>like the jerking off didn't start till I</v>
<v Speaker 5>was like 10 or 12 or whatever it was.</v>

3135
02:18:30.190 --> 02:18:31.330
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the edging,</v>

3136
02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:34.120
<v Speaker 5>I don't come a lot of times because </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the end of the high,</v>

3137
02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:38.620
<v Speaker 5>that's the end of the Ra.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like I just keep it going and to</v>

3138
02:18:38.621 --> 02:18:43.621
<v Speaker 5>keep it going because then you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>know where it's going to go and I don't </v>

3139
02:18:43.621 --> 02:18:43.621
<v Speaker 5>come for days or weeks on end because </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3140
02:18:43.621 --> 02:18:43.780
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we're,</v>

3141
02:18:43.781 --> 02:18:44.580
<v Speaker 5>we kinda just there.</v>

3142
02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:49.800
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because when I come I piss more because </v>

3143
02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:50.510
<v Speaker 5>in my fucking prostates all fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's a disaster.</v>

3144
02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:53.740
<v Speaker 5>Your prostate fucks up because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>come.</v>

3145
02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:54.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I,</v>

3146
02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:54.980
<v Speaker 5>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I,</v>

3147
02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:00.000
<v Speaker 5>when I went on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I start and stop and start and stop and </v>

3148
02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:01.951
<v Speaker 5>start and stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I finally come that the pis like an </v>

3149
02:19:01.951 --> 02:19:01.951
<v Speaker 5>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3150
02:19:01.951 --> 02:19:05.640
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it just fucks you up a little </v>

3151
02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:05.640
<v Speaker 5>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know exactly what that is.</v>

3152
02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:05.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is,</v>

3153
02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:07.720
<v Speaker 5>but this is obviously something that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't like about yourself.</v>

3154
02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:09.250
<v Speaker 5>I hate it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate it,</v>

3155
02:19:09.490 --> 02:19:11.500
<v Speaker 5>but I'm a huge joke or joke around about</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3156
02:19:11.501 --> 02:19:13.690
<v Speaker 5>And you make a lot of comedy about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's there.</v>

3157
02:19:13.691 --> 02:19:18.691
<v Speaker 5>It's always present.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you ever thought about doing </v>

3158
02:19:18.691 --> 02:19:18.691
<v Speaker 5>something to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3159
02:19:18.691 --> 02:19:18.691
<v Speaker 5>Without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3160
02:19:18.691 --> 02:19:19.450
<v Speaker 5>What would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3161
02:19:19.451 --> 02:19:22.810
<v Speaker 5>I would need to go to a certain 12 step </v>
<v Speaker 5>meetings which I've attempted to go to.</v>

3162
02:19:22.811 --> 02:19:27.811
<v Speaker 5>I've gone to talk to people in those </v>
<v Speaker 5>fellowships that get it and understand </v>

3163
02:19:27.811 --> 02:19:27.811
<v Speaker 5>and don't go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3164
02:19:27.811 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 5>you're just</v>

3165
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:30.090
<v Speaker 1>a guy being a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they get it man,</v>

3166
02:19:30.140 --> 02:19:30.680
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3167
02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:34.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would have to just stop doing it.</v>

3168
02:19:34.521 --> 02:19:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really difficult because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you act out.</v>

3169
02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Like if I drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drank.</v>

3170
02:19:39.621 --> 02:19:40.430
<v Speaker 1>If I get high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get high.</v>

3171
02:19:40.431 --> 02:19:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Of course I don't do those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sexual shit of thought and it's like</v>

3172
02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:46.940
<v Speaker 1>eat food is really hard because you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat to live.</v>

3173
02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:48.770
<v Speaker 1>But with sexual shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3174
02:19:48.771 --> 02:19:49.590
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm,</v>

3175
02:19:49.730 --> 02:19:52.220
<v Speaker 1>if I start thinking at that trigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and it's really,</v>

3176
02:19:52.221 --> 02:19:55.520
<v Speaker 1>really difficult to not fall into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern.</v>

3177
02:19:56.040 --> 02:19:58.530
<v Speaker 1>I could offer you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3178
02:19:58.580 --> 02:20:00.890
<v Speaker 1>I could offer you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you could do it,</v>

3179
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:04.340
<v Speaker 1>but what you should think about doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>an Iowaska session.</v>

3180
02:20:04.460 --> 02:20:06.390
<v Speaker 1>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>WASCO is a,</v>

3181
02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:11.400
<v Speaker 1>is a shamanic session in Peru.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually they do it improve Brazil.</v>

3182
02:20:11.481 --> 02:20:14.170
<v Speaker 1>You could do it in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not legal where you're.</v>

3183
02:20:14.260 --> 02:20:19.260
<v Speaker 1>You're doing this a common atory </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drug that allows you to look</v>

3184
02:20:19.311 --> 02:20:24.311
<v Speaker 1>at your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't look at all the issues that </v>

3185
02:20:24.311 --> 02:20:24.311
<v Speaker 1>you have that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a drug like that.</v>

3186
02:20:24.311 --> 02:20:25.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not a drug like it gets you high </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fucked up.</v>

3187
02:20:25.610 --> 02:20:26.800
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get you fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

3188
02:20:26.801 --> 02:20:29.990
<v Speaker 1>it shows you what's going on with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

3189
02:20:30.190 --> 02:20:32.470
<v Speaker 1>It'll show you all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the recidivism rate,</v>

3190
02:20:32.500 --> 02:20:37.500
<v Speaker 1>like the rate of fixing recidivism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like a heroin addiction and it's </v>

3191
02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:38.810
<v Speaker 1>one of the best cures ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one is another one.</v>

3192
02:20:38.990 --> 02:20:40.850
<v Speaker 1>And other psychedelic drug called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ibogaine.</v>

3193
02:20:41.710 --> 02:20:46.710
<v Speaker 1>I began,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know anything about hunter s </v>

3194
02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:48.551
<v Speaker 1>Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he accused Ed Muskie of </v>

3195
02:20:48.551 --> 02:20:48.551
<v Speaker 1>being on during the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3196
02:20:48.551 --> 02:20:52.340
<v Speaker 1>it was in 1970 political campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a presidential campaigns.</v>

3197
02:20:52.370 --> 02:20:57.370
<v Speaker 1>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote some stories in the rolling </v>

3198
02:20:57.370 --> 02:20:59.411
<v Speaker 1>stone saying that there was rumors that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ed Muskie had brought into Brazilian </v>

3199
02:20:59.411 --> 02:21:00.650
<v Speaker 1>doctor and he was high on Ibogaine.</v>

3200
02:21:01.350 --> 02:21:03.760
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I began is actually a different kind</v>

3201
02:21:03.761 --> 02:21:07.160
<v Speaker 1>of drug than what he was describing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a self reflective drug,</v>

3202
02:21:07.460 --> 02:21:09.860
<v Speaker 1>massively effective at curing people </v>
<v Speaker 1>addictions.</v>

3203
02:21:10.100 --> 02:21:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an oxycontin addiction and uh,</v>

3204
02:21:13.090 --> 02:21:14.780
<v Speaker 1>he was really fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had hurt his back,</v>

3205
02:21:14.781 --> 02:21:17.690
<v Speaker 1>started getting on Oxycontin's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then developed a real problem.</v>

3206
02:21:17.691 --> 02:21:21.740
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly physically addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did Ibogaine once,</v>

3207
02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:23.720
<v Speaker 1>cured him of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's never touched it since.</v>

3208
02:21:23.721 --> 02:21:27.440
<v Speaker 1>And now he runs a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an Ibogaine center and helps people with</v>

3209
02:21:27.441 --> 02:21:32.441
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem with me to a lot of </v>

3210
02:21:32.441 --> 02:21:34.181
<v Speaker 1>it comes down to lack of willingness or </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lack of willingness to act like I </v>

3211
02:21:34.181 --> 02:21:37.190
<v Speaker 1>intellectually I know what I have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have a pattern in your mind that</v>

3212
02:21:37.191 --> 02:21:42.191
<v Speaker 1>needs to be reset and you could reset </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind slowly over time or you can </v>

3213
02:21:42.191 --> 02:21:46.841
<v Speaker 1>reset it in one big fucking dump of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information like a dmt trip or like an </v>

3214
02:21:47.871 --> 02:21:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Ibogaine trip.</v>

3215
02:21:48.830 --> 02:21:53.060
<v Speaker 1>And I know you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this thing about not wanting to</v>

3216
02:21:53.090 --> 02:21:55.190
<v Speaker 1>get high or not wanting to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>intoxicated,</v>

3217
02:21:55.640 --> 02:22:00.640
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're thinking of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different effect than what </v>

3218
02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:02.030
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this experience.</v>

3219
02:22:02.060 --> 02:22:03.170
<v Speaker 1>You might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3220
02:22:03.171 --> 02:22:05.480
<v Speaker 1>it scares me too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's something you should be scared</v>

3221
02:22:05.481 --> 02:22:10.481
<v Speaker 1>of what you're doing though too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you don't like it and you </v>

3222
02:22:10.481 --> 02:22:10.481
<v Speaker 1>can't fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3223
02:22:10.481 --> 02:22:10.481
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

3224
02:22:10.481 --> 02:22:11.210
<v Speaker 1>but I can fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lack of.</v>

3225
02:22:11.211 --> 02:22:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Will it like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a really weird thing that I,</v>

3226
02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:18.140
<v Speaker 1>I know what the answer is and like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like it too much.</v>

3227
02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I like it too much and they said to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of liking.</v>

3228
02:22:21.501 --> 02:22:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Lust is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like it.</v>

3229
02:22:23.210 --> 02:22:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let me ask you this then.</v>

3230
02:22:24.441 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 1>What don't you like about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't</v>

3231
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:28.470
<v Speaker 5>like the fact that it distracts me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's consuming.</v>

3232
02:22:28.680 --> 02:22:30.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm much more creative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Without it I am,</v>

3233
02:22:30.990 --> 02:22:31.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

3234
02:22:31.540 --> 02:22:34.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm much more connected without it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I'm on it,</v>

3235
02:22:34.710 --> 02:22:39.710
<v Speaker 5>I see I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm always behind glass and I feel like </v>

3236
02:22:39.710 --> 02:22:42.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm not seeing any real human </v>
<v Speaker 5>interaction at all,</v>

3237
02:22:42.710 --> 02:22:47.710
<v Speaker 5>so it just overwhelmed Sukato completely</v>
<v Speaker 5>overwhelming and I make enough money </v>

3238
02:22:48.271 --> 02:22:49.700
<v Speaker 5>where I can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I want to know.</v>

3239
02:22:49.701 --> 02:22:50.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't be stupid,</v>

3240
02:22:50.731 --> 02:22:52.410
<v Speaker 5>but I mean if I want to get a horse I </v>
<v Speaker 5>can get a horse,</v>

3241
02:22:52.411 --> 02:22:53.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I do.</v>

3242
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:59.550
<v Speaker 5>Do you think there's a way that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could ever just sort of manage it?</v>

3243
02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:05.000
<v Speaker 5>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it a way where you can still indulge </v>

3244
02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:05.610
<v Speaker 5>and enjoy a little bit of sex but not </v>
<v Speaker 5>let it overwhelm you?</v>

3245
02:23:05.670 --> 02:23:10.670
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

3246
02:23:10.670 --> 02:23:10.670
<v Speaker 5>with being kinky or having a </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship with dirty.</v>

3247
02:23:10.670 --> 02:23:10.810
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm not looking to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3248
02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:12.480
<v Speaker 5>in and out through a sheet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3249
02:23:12.480 --> 02:23:14.820
<v Speaker 5>I just don't want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a difference between that.</v>

3250
02:23:14.821 --> 02:23:19.821
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be obsessed with it and </v>

3251
02:23:19.821 --> 02:23:21.900
<v Speaker 5>making it my whole point of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just too much.</v>

3252
02:23:22.050 --> 02:23:27.050
<v Speaker 5>It don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you probably can cure it </v>

3253
02:23:27.050 --> 02:23:29.370
<v Speaker 5>without a psychedelic assurance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in the way you're talking about it,</v>

3254
02:23:29.371 --> 02:23:31.340
<v Speaker 5>it sounds like a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic,</v>

3255
02:23:31.660 --> 02:23:36.660
<v Speaker 5>a lot of other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm obsessive compulsive sort of things </v>

3256
02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:38.090
<v Speaker 5>that psychedelics can cure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you don't.</v>

3257
02:23:38.100 --> 02:23:41.130
<v Speaker 5>Maybe don't go to my free cams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you been there yet?</v>

3258
02:23:41.330 --> 02:23:43.350
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go to [inaudible] dot com.</v>

3259
02:23:43.470 --> 02:23:45.390
<v Speaker 5>Who Doesn't love some good consulting </v>
<v Speaker 5>porn?</v>

3260
02:23:45.410 --> 02:23:50.410
<v Speaker 5>How challenging it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Coc holding everything that I wouldn't </v>

3261
02:23:51.091 --> 02:23:52.410
<v Speaker 5>really want that though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like.</v>

3262
02:23:52.440 --> 02:23:55.500
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what I love cold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't like that black guy to fuck</v>

3263
02:23:55.501 --> 02:23:56.460
<v Speaker 5>your woman in front of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never.</v>

3264
02:23:56.760 --> 02:23:59.160
<v Speaker 5>Never tell you what I like about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>movies.</v>

3265
02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:02.160
<v Speaker 5>It's not necessarily the black guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking the woman.</v>

3266
02:24:02.760 --> 02:24:05.310
<v Speaker 5>It's the husband being there and filming</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3267
02:24:05.330 --> 02:24:10.330
<v Speaker 5>Like there's something that the dynamics</v>
<v Speaker 5>of that is so like if it's just a black </v>

3268
02:24:11.041 --> 02:24:11.850
<v Speaker 5>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking a woman,</v>

3269
02:24:11.851 --> 02:24:14.580
<v Speaker 5>like I don't really watch interracial </v>
<v Speaker 5>porn so I can't relate to the coc in it.</v>

3270
02:24:15.230 --> 02:24:19.230
<v Speaker 5>When it's a husband watching,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all about the woman.</v>

3271
02:24:19.231 --> 02:24:22.560
<v Speaker 5>She's being so dirty and so </v>
<v Speaker 5>inappropriate.</v>

3272
02:24:23.010 --> 02:24:28.010
<v Speaker 5>It makes me feel something and I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a problem is I'm so numb that </v>

3273
02:24:28.171 --> 02:24:31.680
<v Speaker 5>like if I didn't do this shit for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>while then I get my dick sucked.</v>

3274
02:24:31.681 --> 02:24:33.210
<v Speaker 5>It feels good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you,</v>

3275
02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:35.460
<v Speaker 5>when I'm fucking just won't leave my </v>
<v Speaker 5>dick alone.</v>

3276
02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:41.480
<v Speaker 5>Fucking I'm fucking wheatland my nipples</v>
<v Speaker 5>and trying to get a fucking disaster.</v>

3277
02:24:43.310 --> 02:24:45.720
<v Speaker 5>It's a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can get numb,</v>

3278
02:24:45.930 --> 02:24:50.930
<v Speaker 5>totally numb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when I lay off for awhile then it </v>

3279
02:24:50.930 --> 02:24:50.930
<v Speaker 5>feels good again.</v>

3280
02:24:50.930 --> 02:24:53.220
<v Speaker 5>Then I don't need to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I don't need to go there.</v>

3281
02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:55.260
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do manage it to a certain degree.</v>

3282
02:24:55.560 --> 02:25:00.560
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm more responsible than I should </v>
<v Speaker 5>be considering how fucking far gone I </v>

3283
02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:04.521
<v Speaker 5>am.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm much more careful than you think </v>

3284
02:25:05.070 --> 02:25:10.070
<v Speaker 5>that comes with being sober.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there are consequences I'm aware </v>

3285
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.070
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm.</v>

3286
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:11.160
<v Speaker 5>You've been sober since you were like </v>
<v Speaker 5>19,</v>

3287
02:25:11.161 --> 02:25:12.600
<v Speaker 5>18 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twenty six.</v>

3288
02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:13.770
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3289
02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:18.780
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's an amazing [inaudible] you gave </v>

3290
02:25:18.780 --> 02:25:20.220
<v Speaker 5>up on it real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not for me.</v>

3291
02:25:20.221 --> 02:25:20.670
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3292
02:25:20.671 --> 02:25:24.070
<v Speaker 5>If you rob see robbed three banks and </v>
<v Speaker 5>every time</v>

3293
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:25.900
<v Speaker 4>one of your friends get shot and you go </v>
<v Speaker 4>to jail,</v>

3294
02:25:25.901 --> 02:25:27.820
<v Speaker 4>he liked robin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Banks is just not for me.</v>

3295
02:25:27.970 --> 02:25:29.830
<v Speaker 4>That's what it was with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't do it.</v>

3296
02:25:29.831 --> 02:25:33.250
<v Speaker 4>Every time I do it there's a problem and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's only gonna get worse and worse.</v>

3297
02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:38.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that along the same lines of </v>

3298
02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:40.201
<v Speaker 4>your obsessive thing with sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get that obsessive with </v>

3299
02:25:40.201 --> 02:25:40.201
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3300
02:25:40.201 --> 02:25:45.030
<v Speaker 4>and it could be good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you get that obsessed about </v>

3301
02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:45.030
<v Speaker 4>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3302
02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:45.820
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think especially if you go back</v>

3303
02:25:45.821 --> 02:25:50.821
<v Speaker 4>to your early days like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember like what it was like </v>

3304
02:25:50.821 --> 02:25:54.271
<v Speaker 4>when you first get an onstage that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like really was like a drug you were </v>

3305
02:25:54.271 --> 02:25:54.280
<v Speaker 4>seeking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a high.</v>

3306
02:25:54.670 --> 02:25:57.040
<v Speaker 4>The thing is though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't turn me into somebody I don't</v>

3307
02:25:57.041 --> 02:25:58.900
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas when I drink,</v>

3308
02:25:58.930 --> 02:26:01.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm an ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>angry drunk.</v>

3309
02:26:01.061 --> 02:26:02.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm a violent drunk.</v>

3310
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:04.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm a self destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Physically drunk.</v>

3311
02:26:04.270 --> 02:26:05.910
<v Speaker 4>Do you think you still would be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it.</v>

3312
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:11.550
<v Speaker 4>I know there's not a doubt in my mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not giving the sobriety company </v>

3313
02:26:12.191 --> 02:26:14.950
<v Speaker 4>line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just know how I think you know,</v>

3314
02:26:14.951 --> 02:26:18.190
<v Speaker 4>you and literally after I shot please be</v>
<v Speaker 4>offended,</v>

3315
02:26:18.191 --> 02:26:22.330
<v Speaker 4>which was over a year ago in Cleveland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't happy with it and I'm like,</v>

3316
02:26:22.331 --> 02:26:22.870
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3317
02:26:22.890 --> 02:26:25.450
<v Speaker 4>I just wanted to hang myself in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>closet and I was like,</v>

3318
02:26:25.451 --> 02:26:30.451
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put a belt up and I wasn't going to </v>

3319
02:26:30.451 --> 02:26:30.451
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew I wasn't gonna do it.</v>

3320
02:26:30.451 --> 02:26:30.451
<v Speaker 4>You put a belt on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3321
02:26:30.451 --> 02:26:30.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I knew I wouldn't do it.</v>

3322
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:33.640
<v Speaker 4>This is not some psychotic cry for help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew it wasn't gonna happen,</v>

3323
02:26:34.030 --> 02:26:35.770
<v Speaker 4>but I was so mad at myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3324
02:26:35.771 --> 02:26:40.771
<v Speaker 4>you fucking stink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That I all I could think about was just </v>

3325
02:26:40.771 --> 02:26:41.200
<v Speaker 4>that feeling of my fucking throat being </v>
<v Speaker 4>cut off.</v>

3326
02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:42.610
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3327
02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:47.760
<v Speaker 4>I wound up editing the special with </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and then liking it once it came </v>

3328
02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:50.740
<v Speaker 4>out a little bit and then I saw it </v>
<v Speaker 4>recently and I'm like,</v>

3329
02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:51.910
<v Speaker 4>it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

3330
02:26:51.911 --> 02:26:52.930
<v Speaker 4>What's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Fuck?</v>

3331
02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:54.760
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked it a lot more.</v>

3332
02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:58.750
<v Speaker 4>This one I actually am very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very happy with immediately,</v>

3333
02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:04.020
<v Speaker 4>but the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it took a while and I think I had just </v>

3334
02:27:04.020 --> 02:27:06.360
<v Speaker 4>been doing the material a little longer </v>
<v Speaker 4>than I should have and by that I was </v>

3335
02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:06.360
<v Speaker 4>done with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That does happen.</v>

3336
02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:07.840
<v Speaker 4>How long had you been doing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>material?</v>

3337
02:27:07.841 --> 02:27:08.620
<v Speaker 4>For?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many years?</v>

3338
02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:09.730
<v Speaker 4>Not Too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too Long.</v>

3339
02:27:09.731 --> 02:27:10.470
<v Speaker 4>A couple of year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3340
02:27:10.471 --> 02:27:11.140
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3341
02:27:11.141 --> 02:27:13.030
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this one I shot 10 months later.</v>

3342
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:15.400
<v Speaker 4>I was ready to get this one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still,</v>

3343
02:27:15.490 --> 02:27:18.390
<v Speaker 4>I missed the material now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I loved doing it so.</v>

3344
02:27:18.430 --> 02:27:19.360
<v Speaker 4>But I know how crazy.</v>

3345
02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:22.540
<v Speaker 4>I think in irrational and moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's why I don't own a pistol.</v>

3346
02:27:22.541 --> 02:27:27.541
<v Speaker 4>It's why I don't know because I know I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have that one moment that you can </v>

3347
02:27:27.541 --> 02:27:27.541
<v Speaker 4>take back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3348
02:27:27.541 --> 02:27:32.521
<v Speaker 4>I have a real similar problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's as extreme as you </v>

3349
02:27:32.521 --> 02:27:34.240
<v Speaker 4>don't have a problem with drinking or </v>
<v Speaker 4>with drugs,</v>

3350
02:27:34.510 --> 02:27:37.630
<v Speaker 4>but I do have a lot of extremity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of,</v>

3351
02:27:37.631 --> 02:27:42.631
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a lot of impulses and a lot of </v>

3352
02:27:42.631 --> 02:27:42.790
<v Speaker 4>craziness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I keep it under wraps.</v>

3353
02:27:43.140 --> 02:27:48.140
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the reasons why I have to </v>

3354
02:27:48.140 --> 02:27:48.140
<v Speaker 4>work out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I work out on a regular basis,</v>

3355
02:27:48.140 --> 02:27:49.570
<v Speaker 4>like I need discipline in my life in </v>
<v Speaker 4>order to keep order.</v>

3356
02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:51.220
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if I got like that,</v>

3357
02:27:51.250 --> 02:27:56.250
<v Speaker 4>whether it was jerking off or if I got </v>
<v Speaker 4>into a drug or became like super </v>

3358
02:27:56.531 --> 02:28:01.531
<v Speaker 4>impulsive like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to think that I'd be able to </v>

3359
02:28:01.531 --> 02:28:06.061
<v Speaker 4>pull myself back because my objective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I looked at myself and I'm </v>

3360
02:28:06.061 --> 02:28:08.970
<v Speaker 4>self-analyze lot but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not that confident and it's one </v>

3361
02:28:08.970 --> 02:28:09.550
<v Speaker 4>of the reasons why I've never touched </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything really addictive.</v>

3362
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:11.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Besides alcohol,</v>

3363
02:28:11.230 --> 02:28:15.220
<v Speaker 4>which isn't addictive to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've never fucked with anything that</v>

3364
02:28:15.221 --> 02:28:17.590
<v Speaker 4>could get you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Anthony's a fun drunk.</v>

3365
02:28:17.770 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Columbia is a fun drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am not a</v>

3366
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:23.540
<v Speaker 5>fun drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not.</v>

3367
02:28:23.541 --> 02:28:28.541
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just have so much different than you </v>

3368
02:28:28.541 --> 02:28:28.541
<v Speaker 5>were when you were 18 to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

3369
02:28:28.541 --> 02:28:32.170
<v Speaker 5>That's very true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But because so many of these other </v>

3370
02:28:32.170 --> 02:28:34.241
<v Speaker 5>feelings are still there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I'm the drunk that all of a sudden </v>

3371
02:28:34.241 --> 02:28:35.120
<v Speaker 5>after four beers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my nose is down,</v>

3372
02:28:35.121 --> 02:28:37.500
<v Speaker 5>but my eyes are up and I looked like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking,</v>

3373
02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:39.080
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>give us remembering the shiny.</v>

3374
02:28:39.081 --> 02:28:40.670
<v Speaker 5>When Nicholson's wearing the maroon </v>
<v Speaker 5>coat,</v>

3375
02:28:40.671 --> 02:28:42.830
<v Speaker 5>that psych,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the look I have.</v>

3376
02:28:43.010 --> 02:28:44.420
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3377
02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:45.680
<v Speaker 5>I just don't trust it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the,</v>

3378
02:28:45.681 --> 02:28:48.550
<v Speaker 5>and the price to pay is just too much </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's not worth it.</v>

3379
02:28:48.551 --> 02:28:49.190
<v Speaker 5>And nobody knows</v>

3380
02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:51.340
<v Speaker 1>better than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend tastes the same way.</v>

3381
02:28:51.341 --> 02:28:52.210
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

3382
02:28:52.450 --> 02:28:54.220
<v Speaker 1>we can't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't smoke a joint,</v>

3383
02:28:54.221 --> 02:28:55.270
<v Speaker 1>can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3384
02:28:55.770 --> 02:29:00.770
<v Speaker 1>it might be great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I might wake up three days </v>

3385
02:29:00.770 --> 02:29:00.770
<v Speaker 1>later not knowing how the fuck I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3386
02:29:00.770 --> 02:29:00.770
<v Speaker 5>And I don't miss it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3387
02:29:00.770 --> 02:29:01.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't knock it either.</v>

3388
02:29:01.981 --> 02:29:06.981
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you smoke pot and you have to run </v>

3389
02:29:06.981 --> 02:29:06.981
<v Speaker 5>this career.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're driven.</v>

3390
02:29:06.981 --> 02:29:07.680
<v Speaker 5>You're a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the best announcer in sports.</v>

3391
02:29:07.681 --> 02:29:08.810
<v Speaker 5>You have an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>

3392
02:29:08.850 --> 02:29:13.850
<v Speaker 5>literally your life is very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very professional and functional and </v>

3393
02:29:13.850 --> 02:29:14.100
<v Speaker 5>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have a wife and kid,</v>

3394
02:29:14.130 --> 02:29:17.940
<v Speaker 5>like you do all these things and smoke </v>
<v Speaker 5>pot and like for you,</v>

3395
02:29:17.941 --> 02:29:21.990
<v Speaker 5>it's cool if I could do that gladly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I can't.</v>

3396
02:29:22.140 --> 02:29:23.610
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know I can't,</v>

3397
02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:24.560
<v Speaker 5>not for any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3398
02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:26.040
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're just wired differently,</v>

3399
02:29:26.590 --> 02:29:29.020
<v Speaker 1>wired differently and people need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really recognize that.</v>

3400
02:29:29.350 --> 02:29:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

3401
02:29:30.311 --> 02:29:32.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really important point for me.</v>

3402
02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:35.380
<v Speaker 1>It helps me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps me calm,</v>

3403
02:29:35.381 --> 02:29:38.230
<v Speaker 1>makes me nicer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me more relaxed so I wouldn't,</v>

3404
02:29:38.231 --> 02:29:40.180
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be productive stones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3405
02:29:40.181 --> 02:29:40.870
<v Speaker 1>you're productive.</v>

3406
02:29:40.900 --> 02:29:43.660
<v Speaker 5>Do you smoke a joint and come in and </v>
<v Speaker 5>talk for three hours?</v>

3407
02:29:43.900 --> 02:29:44.890
<v Speaker 5>If I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I smoke,</v>

3408
02:29:44.891 --> 02:29:47.710
<v Speaker 5>if I took two hits to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just look at the microphone.</v>

3409
02:29:48.460 --> 02:29:50.110
<v Speaker 5>Fucking dunce.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would do nothing.</v>

3410
02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't,</v>

3411
02:29:51.140 --> 02:29:53.300
<v Speaker 1>but you don't need it for whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

3412
02:29:53.301 --> 02:29:58.301
<v Speaker 1>It's for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives me a perspective that's not </v>

3413
02:29:58.301 --> 02:29:58.730
<v Speaker 1>available without the pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

3414
02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously I can get </v>

3415
02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:05.891
<v Speaker 1>introspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can think about things deeply without </v>

3416
02:30:05.891 --> 02:30:07.160
<v Speaker 1>any help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need any marijuana or drugs,</v>

3417
02:30:07.161 --> 02:30:08.570
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I take them,</v>

3418
02:30:08.571 --> 02:30:13.571
<v Speaker 1>I often feel like there's windows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are open that wouldn't be open </v>

3419
02:30:13.571 --> 02:30:13.571
<v Speaker 1>ordinarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3420
02:30:13.571 --> 02:30:18.521
<v Speaker 1>Carl Sagan had a quote about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see if I can remember it because </v>

3421
02:30:18.521 --> 02:30:21.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascinating quote because Carl </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sagan is one of my favorite.</v>

3422
02:30:21.250 --> 02:30:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is great.</v>

3423
02:30:22.340 --> 02:30:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Science Katz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a bad motherfucker.</v>

3424
02:30:24.681 --> 02:30:29.681
<v Speaker 1>This is what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am convinced that there are genuine </v>

3425
02:30:29.681 --> 02:30:32.111
<v Speaker 1>and valid levels of perception available</v>
<v Speaker 1>with cannabis and probably other drugs </v>

3426
02:30:32.111 --> 02:30:36.461
<v Speaker 1>which are through the defects of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>society and our educational system </v>

3427
02:30:36.461 --> 02:30:37.190
<v Speaker 1>unavailable to us without such drugs.</v>

3428
02:30:37.640 --> 02:30:38.960
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3429
02:30:39.380 --> 02:30:41.570
<v Speaker 1>but that's just me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably correct.</v>

3430
02:30:41.720 --> 02:30:46.720
<v Speaker 1>For me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana lets me know what I actually </v>

3431
02:30:46.720 --> 02:30:46.720
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it sounds ridiculous,</v>

3432
02:30:46.730 --> 02:30:48.380
<v Speaker 1>but when I get high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I.</v>

3433
02:30:48.410 --> 02:30:51.080
<v Speaker 1>If I enjoy something when I'm high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I really enjoy it.</v>

3434
02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:54.290
<v Speaker 1>But if I get high and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get me away from this fucking thing,</v>

3435
02:30:54.590 --> 02:30:57.320
<v Speaker 1>usually that's my actual feelings about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3436
02:30:57.500 --> 02:31:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's with people or whether it </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhances what,</v>

3437
02:31:01.340 --> 02:31:06.340
<v Speaker 1>how I already feel about certain people </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhances already feel about food or </v>

3438
02:31:06.340 --> 02:31:07.730
<v Speaker 1>about sex or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's just me,</v>

3439
02:31:08.390 --> 02:31:09.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

3440
02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:14.360
<v Speaker 1>I took me till I was 30 before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized that even worked for me right </v>

3441
02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:15.620
<v Speaker 1>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was all for idiots.</v>

3442
02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:16.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3443
02:31:16.621 --> 02:31:17.190
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>

3444
02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:17.840
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3445
02:31:17.950 --> 02:31:20.280
<v Speaker 5>I wish I could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

3446
02:31:20.281 --> 02:31:22.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm okay with the fact that I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3447
02:31:22.890 --> 02:31:27.890
<v Speaker 5>I would like to manage the sec shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>better because I'm a better person when </v>

3448
02:31:27.890 --> 02:31:29.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a more connected person,</v>

3449
02:31:30.030 --> 02:31:35.030
<v Speaker 5>like I care about people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I can become very uncaring and very </v>

3450
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:37.680
<v Speaker 5>distracted and very distant when I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that mode because it's addiction.</v>

3451
02:31:37.710 --> 02:31:40.830
<v Speaker 5>It's like any other addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not present.</v>

3452
02:31:40.870 --> 02:31:42.150
<v Speaker 5>And I think that it makes me not </v>
<v Speaker 5>present.</v>

3453
02:31:42.330 --> 02:31:43.860
<v Speaker 5>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the big point.</v>

3454
02:31:43.861 --> 02:31:46.620
<v Speaker 5>And that's what people don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>An addiction will never understand.</v>

3455
02:31:46.830 --> 02:31:48.640
<v Speaker 5>I've had many addictions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3456
02:31:48.750 --> 02:31:53.750
<v Speaker 5>I've had a lot of video game problems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>behavioral type shit that really is just</v>

3457
02:31:54.931 --> 02:31:59.931
<v Speaker 5>like a drug addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It becomes an addiction of video game </v>

3458
02:31:59.931 --> 02:32:02.721
<v Speaker 5>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Might as well be a drug addiction and </v>

3459
02:32:02.721 --> 02:32:02.721
<v Speaker 5>it's really similar to a sexual </v>
<v Speaker 5>addiction.</v>

3460
02:32:02.721 --> 02:32:05.640
<v Speaker 5>It focuses you on something outside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gets to zone out.</v>

3461
02:32:06.270 --> 02:32:10.450
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it's just zone out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just the feeling numb,</v>

3462
02:32:10.470 --> 02:32:14.260
<v Speaker 5>the numbness and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to think and I like to create and</v>

3463
02:32:14.261 --> 02:32:16.170
<v Speaker 5>I like to fucking sit at my computer and</v>
<v Speaker 5>write.</v>

3464
02:32:16.470 --> 02:32:19.320
<v Speaker 5>This is how it a fucking pervert.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when I wrote my books,</v>

3465
02:32:19.321 --> 02:32:21.450
<v Speaker 5>the second book especially I wrote at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the comedy cellar.</v>

3466
02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:25.200
<v Speaker 5>I would come up with stuff and I would </v>
<v Speaker 5>write it in the cellar because it was.</v>

3467
02:32:25.201 --> 02:32:27.930
<v Speaker 5>I was surrounded by people so I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>jerk off.</v>

3468
02:32:28.440 --> 02:32:31.270
<v Speaker 5>Like I had to be in a public place to </v>
<v Speaker 5>sit on my laptop and right,</v>

3469
02:32:31.860 --> 02:32:32.490
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

3470
02:32:32.491 --> 02:32:34.180
<v Speaker 5>I would just be in the corner writing </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I couldn't.</v>

3471
02:32:34.190 --> 02:32:39.190
<v Speaker 5>I could do enough instant messaging like</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk dirty so I could get a little </v>

3472
02:32:39.190 --> 02:32:40.410
<v Speaker 5>dopamine drip,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I couldn't go the extra route,</v>

3473
02:32:40.650 --> 02:32:44.390
<v Speaker 5>which was the fucking Yank out my Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my Dick soft.</v>

3474
02:32:44.570 --> 02:32:46.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm just yanking it against my dumb </v>
<v Speaker 5>stomach,</v>

3475
02:32:46.770 --> 02:32:47.820
<v Speaker 5>zone out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>zone out,</v>

3476
02:32:47.821 --> 02:32:48.660
<v Speaker 5>zone out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>click,</v>

3477
02:32:48.690 --> 02:32:50.460
<v Speaker 5>zone out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing real.</v>

3478
02:32:50.580 --> 02:32:52.830
<v Speaker 5>Nothing to feeling good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many times a day would you say?</v>

3479
02:32:52.920 --> 02:32:57.920
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't even come all day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever thought about taking a </v>

3480
02:32:57.920 --> 02:32:58.470
<v Speaker 5>laptop and disabling the Wifi </v>
<v Speaker 5>connection?</v>

3481
02:32:58.530 --> 02:32:59.440
<v Speaker 5>You could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3482
02:32:59.490 --> 02:33:01.800
<v Speaker 5>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I needed it for research and I liked</v>

3483
02:33:01.801 --> 02:33:05.300
<v Speaker 5>him being gay with the fucking research </v>
<v Speaker 5>because bashing public figures,</v>

3484
02:33:05.301 --> 02:33:06.910
<v Speaker 5>so I had to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3485
02:33:06.911 --> 02:33:08.590
<v Speaker 5>like I was shocked and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3486
02:33:09.260 --> 02:33:14.260
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes you need that for </v>
<v Speaker 5>reference and I also liked the </v>

3487
02:33:14.260 --> 02:33:14.260
<v Speaker 5>distraction of it because it puts less </v>
<v Speaker 5>pressure on me.</v>

3488
02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:16.430
<v Speaker 5>Like even if it's on watching black </v>
<v Speaker 5>sabbath videos,</v>

3489
02:33:16.460 --> 02:33:21.460
<v Speaker 5>I'll go on youtube and watch Sabbath </v>
<v Speaker 5>live in fucking to Melbourne again </v>

3490
02:33:21.460 --> 02:33:24.891
<v Speaker 5>because I feel like watching Ozzie </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying God is dead for the front and </v>

3491
02:33:24.891 --> 02:33:24.891
<v Speaker 5>that will distract me from it.</v>

3492
02:33:24.891 --> 02:33:24.930
<v Speaker 5>And then creatively like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3493
02:33:24.931 --> 02:33:29.931
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It allows me to step away for a second </v>

3494
02:33:29.931 --> 02:33:29.931
<v Speaker 5>mentally because I'm just forcing myself</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3495
02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:31.200
<v Speaker 5>write,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't write.</v>

3496
02:33:31.530 --> 02:33:35.220
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever thought about trying some </v>
<v Speaker 5>other form of discipline,</v>

3497
02:33:35.221 --> 02:33:36.960
<v Speaker 5>like yoga or something along those </v>
<v Speaker 5>lines?</v>

3498
02:33:37.170 --> 02:33:42.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say that yoga would keep you </v>

3499
02:33:42.170 --> 02:33:44.301
<v Speaker 5>from being a sex addict,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the fucking head of beef crumbs is </v>

3500
02:33:44.301 --> 02:33:47.991

<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

3505
02:33:58.290 --> 02:34:00.990
<v Speaker 5>He dresses like a pimp and almost </v>
<v Speaker 5>literally.</v>

3506
02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:02.870
<v Speaker 5>How do you fucking not become a sex side</v>
<v Speaker 5>when?</v>

3507
02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:05.550
<v Speaker 5>When the girl in front of you was </v>
<v Speaker 5>wearing cellophane pants and her fucking</v>

3508
02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:08.850
<v Speaker 5>Qantas jumping out at you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks like Al Jolson's face.</v>

3509
02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:11.670
<v Speaker 5>How do you not get turned on by that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not him.</v>

3510
02:34:11.700 --> 02:34:13.080
<v Speaker 5>Is that him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3511
02:34:13.081 --> 02:34:15.510
<v Speaker 5>That's not the image I was thinking of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's a good one.</v>

3512
02:34:15.750 --> 02:34:18.130
<v Speaker 5>Just thinking about him slinging and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Indian Dick all</v>

3513
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:19.510
<v Speaker 4>over that room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3514
02:34:21.730 --> 02:34:22.960
<v Speaker 4>yoga is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've tried.</v>

3515
02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:27.430
<v Speaker 4>Working out has helped a little bit like</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes me feel better about myself.</v>

3516
02:34:27.431 --> 02:34:30.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm more comfortable and confident like </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know where I want to be,</v>

3517
02:34:30.251 --> 02:34:34.150
<v Speaker 4>but I'm much better than I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like I feel like I see results.</v>

3518
02:34:34.210 --> 02:34:36.670
<v Speaker 4>I bet if you did yoga four or five days </v>
<v Speaker 4>a week,</v>

3519
02:34:36.730 --> 02:34:39.200
<v Speaker 4>you could fucking hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet you could hold on.</v>

3520
02:34:39.620 --> 02:34:42.370
<v Speaker 2>I think I roommate take off all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>doors in your place.</v>

3521
02:34:42.780 --> 02:34:45.720
<v Speaker 4>Probably just be jerking off in front of</v>
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>

3522
02:34:45.721 --> 02:34:50.721
<v Speaker 4>After a while they would just sit back </v>
<v Speaker 4>to back like a fucking Rom composter </v>

3523
02:34:50.721 --> 02:34:52.320
<v Speaker 4>juggling at the same laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that like prisoners,</v>

3524
02:34:52.490 --> 02:34:55.430
<v Speaker 4>they not jerk off because there's other </v>
<v Speaker 4>prisoners around it.</v>

3525
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:58.410
<v Speaker 4>Just fucking do it just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>cells and dudes just jacking it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like looking right at him after a while </v>

3528
02:35:06.111 --> 02:35:07.470

<v Speaker 4>You just get used to it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>far as like what really gets us in some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets us on a track and now it's so </v>

3531
02:35:15.741 --> 02:35:18.390
<v Speaker 4>difficult to get off that track and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>obsession.</v>

3532
02:35:18.570 --> 02:35:23.570
<v Speaker 4>Like they just constantly wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>find another video or another video or </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like nonstop.</v>

3539
02:35:39.140 --> 02:35:40.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just not as self aware as he is.</v>

3540
02:35:40.730 --> 02:35:45.730
<v Speaker 4>You're not trying to fix yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Realizing that he's a mess and you're </v>

<v Speaker 2>And I was at starbucks and I had a </v>

3547
02:35:55.711 --> 02:35:55.711
<v Speaker 2>little bit of a lotion still on my hand </v>

<v Speaker 4>Get to the Guidestar,</v>

3552
02:36:02.090 --> 02:36:05.170
<v Speaker 4>but he's not going to discuss that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to talk about the times you</v>

3553
02:36:05.171 --> 02:36:07.900
<v Speaker 4>slimed people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I can't get onto the morning.</v>

3554
02:36:07.901 --> 02:36:09.140
<v Speaker 4>I can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sexual activity.</v>

3555
02:36:09.150 --> 02:36:11.500
<v Speaker 4>Busy clearing out my sinuses and my had </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

3556
02:36:11.501 --> 02:36:13.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to fuck in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to talk.</v>

3557
02:36:13.180 --> 02:36:15.880
<v Speaker 4>I smelled your load once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember you picked it out of your belly</v>

3558
02:36:15.881 --> 02:36:17.550
<v Speaker 4>button.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3559
02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:20.390
<v Speaker 4>From the night before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he knows you're welcome.</v>

3560
02:36:21.400 --> 02:36:23.920
<v Speaker 4>It's one thing if you smell your own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is pretty disgusting,</v>

3561
02:36:24.580 --> 02:36:29.080
<v Speaker 4>but when you smell other people's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I'm a disgusting person when I,</v>

3562
02:36:29.140 --> 02:36:31.270
<v Speaker 4>when I jerk off and I don't even bother </v>
<v Speaker 4>cleaning up,</v>

3563
02:36:31.271 --> 02:36:35.020
<v Speaker 4>I just wipe it with my underwear and put</v>
<v Speaker 4>them right back in my underwear and then</v>

3564
02:36:35.021 --> 02:36:40.021
<v Speaker 4>I get up in the morning and take a leak </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I smell it usually on the road </v>

3565
02:36:40.021 --> 02:36:43.110
<v Speaker 4>maintenance jerking off and then I get </v>
<v Speaker 4>up in the morning on the road to Piss </v>

3566
02:36:43.110 --> 02:36:43.110
<v Speaker 4>and I lift up the toilet and pull my </v>
<v Speaker 4>dick out.</v>

3567
02:36:43.110 --> 02:36:46.370
<v Speaker 4>My what is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just like,</v>

3568
02:36:46.660 --> 02:36:47.890
<v Speaker 4>like the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3569
02:36:48.340 --> 02:36:53.340
<v Speaker 4>like the banks of a polluted river.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so gross.</v>

3570
02:36:54.940 --> 02:36:57.910
<v Speaker 4>Wipe it right off live and right off </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes right off.</v>

3571
02:36:58.810 --> 02:37:03.810
<v Speaker 4>If you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could fix one aspect of yourself </v>

3572
02:37:03.810 --> 02:37:07.050
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing that you would like to </v>

3573
02:37:07.050 --> 02:37:07.050
<v Speaker 4>get on track?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

3574
02:37:07.050 --> 02:37:09.871
<v Speaker 4>Because I think it stops me career wise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I have a good career where like I </v>

3575
02:37:09.871 --> 02:37:10.950
<v Speaker 4>enjoy where I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

3576
02:37:10.980 --> 02:37:15.980
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it allows me to stagnate on a level </v>

3577
02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:16.190
<v Speaker 4>where I should</v>

3578
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:21.190
<v Speaker 5>not be stagnating and it permits me to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be comfortable where I shouldn't be </v>

3579
02:37:21.190 --> 02:37:22.330
<v Speaker 5>comfortable and it's like a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>safety signal,</v>

3580
02:37:22.340 --> 02:37:26.210
<v Speaker 5>little security blanket where it </v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't be about getting maybe like,</v>

3581
02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:31.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a cock lock or one of those </v>

3582
02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:31.600
<v Speaker 5>chastity belt locks where he has a key </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you turn them on.</v>

3583
02:37:31.650 --> 02:37:34.500
<v Speaker 5>You had to find something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would just get Mr to put a strap on,</v>

3584
02:37:34.501 --> 02:37:35.900
<v Speaker 5>on and spit on me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3585
02:37:36.870 --> 02:37:38.960
<v Speaker 5>always.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's always a way.</v>

3586
02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:40.700
<v Speaker 5>Do you still like that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you're,</v>

3587
02:37:40.701 --> 02:37:41.080
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3588
02:37:41.090 --> 02:37:43.580
<v Speaker 5>you're in a dominatrix isn't sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3589
02:37:43.581 --> 02:37:45.530
<v Speaker 5>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't in a while,</v>

3590
02:37:45.531 --> 02:37:47.000
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can be very sexy.</v>

3591
02:37:47.001 --> 02:37:47.580
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they're,</v>

3592
02:37:47.581 --> 02:37:49.810
<v Speaker 5>they're good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they know what they're doing,</v>

3593
02:37:50.100 --> 02:37:51.830
<v Speaker 5>if they're just like the whole dirtiness</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>

3594
02:37:52.700 --> 02:37:53.600
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>

3595
02:37:53.601 --> 02:37:57.230
<v Speaker 5>I love the perversion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love a woman who can read me.</v>

3596
02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:00.260
<v Speaker 5>Every guy wants to be owned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether you're dominant or submissive,</v>

3597
02:38:00.470 --> 02:38:03.860
<v Speaker 5>and when a woman can read me and </v>
<v Speaker 5>anticipate what I want,</v>

3598
02:38:04.340 --> 02:38:07.830
<v Speaker 5>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So fired up,</v>

3599
02:38:07.890 --> 02:38:10.130
<v Speaker 5>but it's hot man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just enjoy that though.</v>

3600
02:38:10.210 --> 02:38:11.990
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why does it have to be an obsession?</v>

3601
02:38:12.110 --> 02:38:14.780
<v Speaker 5>Is Is there a balance that can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>achieved here?</v>

3602
02:38:15.170 --> 02:38:17.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can just enjoy the sex and sexuality</v>

3603
02:38:17.781 --> 02:38:20.060
<v Speaker 5>and just not tweak on all day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's greed.</v>

3604
02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:25.300
<v Speaker 5>It's being greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's wanting one as they say more than </v>

3605
02:38:25.300 --> 02:38:27.701
<v Speaker 5>my share.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twenty more than my share of pleasure </v>

3606
02:38:27.701 --> 02:38:30.190
<v Speaker 5>and more than my share of experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's walk into a candy store and not </v>

3607
02:38:30.190 --> 02:38:33.821
<v Speaker 5>picking a candy bar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's grabbing for everything and then </v>

3608
02:38:33.821 --> 02:38:34.430
<v Speaker 5>shoving it into my fucking face and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>crime that I have a stomach ache,</v>

3609
02:38:34.610 --> 02:38:37.640
<v Speaker 5>but you've got enough discipline to work</v>
<v Speaker 5>out and lose all this weight like you've</v>

3610
02:38:37.641 --> 02:38:40.580
<v Speaker 5>changed your body over the last six </v>
<v Speaker 5>months or a year or so.</v>

3611

<v Speaker 5>wraps,</v>

02:39:18.660 --> 02:39:20.501
<v Speaker 5>physicality getting out of control.</v>

02:39:20.501 --> 02:39:23.951
<v Speaker 5>healthy for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I got a trainer sessions at least </v>

<v Speaker 5>just get another pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it was funny.</v>

3664
02:40:34.230 --> 02:40:35.730
<v Speaker 4>That was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

3665
02:40:35.731 --> 02:40:36.800
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3666
02:40:36.810 --> 02:40:39.610
<v Speaker 4>those shows that you guys used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how come you guys stopped doing those,</v>

3667
02:40:39.630 --> 02:40:41.660
<v Speaker 4>those big comedy shows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3668
02:40:41.850 --> 02:40:42.660
<v Speaker 4>it just became,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3669
02:40:42.661 --> 02:40:44.970
<v Speaker 4>we lost terrestrial radio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I was happy for it,</v>

3670
02:40:44.971 --> 02:40:49.971
<v Speaker 4>but it became harder to do and it became</v>
<v Speaker 4>harder to get guys booked and now we </v>

3671
02:40:49.971 --> 02:40:50.790
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just went away.</v>

3672
02:40:50.810 --> 02:40:54.120
<v Speaker 4>The merger happened and things changed </v>
<v Speaker 4>once we merged,</v>

3673
02:40:54.121 --> 02:40:56.670
<v Speaker 4>there was disadvantages to it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's advantages to it.</v>

3674
02:40:56.730 --> 02:40:58.100
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3675
02:40:58.110 --> 02:41:02.460
<v Speaker 4>I liked being in our old studio at Xm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked the thing about Sirius I like is</v>

3676
02:41:02.461 --> 02:41:04.920
<v Speaker 4>the guests we can get are much better </v>
<v Speaker 4>because already in the building.</v>

3677
02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:07.470
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of times we get people that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>would not have gotten ever.</v>

3678
02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:08.730
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3679
02:41:08.731 --> 02:41:13.731
<v Speaker 4>there's been some great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're open to a much larger group of </v>

3680
02:41:13.731 --> 02:41:13.731
<v Speaker 4>people now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3681
02:41:13.731 --> 02:41:14.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the good with the bad.</v>

3682
02:41:14.490 --> 02:41:16.260
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what your numbers are?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No idea.</v>

3683
02:41:16.261 --> 02:41:18.150
<v Speaker 4>I probably could find out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't ask.</v>

3684
02:41:18.151 --> 02:41:20.160
<v Speaker 4>I just don't want to know because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't wanna be disappointed.</v>

3685
02:41:20.480 --> 02:41:21.090
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

3686
02:41:21.091 --> 02:41:26.091
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I have a decent amount of </v>

3687
02:41:26.091 --> 02:41:26.290
<v Speaker 4>followers and decent amount of fans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3688
02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:31.520
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no fucking idea what I mean as </v>

3689
02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:31.520
<v Speaker 4>far as like how many people listened to </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

3690
02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:33.150
<v Speaker 4>kill me every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know how we'd find that out</v>

3691
02:41:33.151 --> 02:41:35.130
<v Speaker 4>because they know arbitron diary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they do,</v>

3692
02:41:35.131 --> 02:41:39.930
<v Speaker 4>but they don't want to tell us because </v>
<v Speaker 4>we sent out surveys tuned in you,</v>

3693
02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:43.440
<v Speaker 4>you have to be tuned into that frequency</v>
<v Speaker 4>or that it doesn't tell you that way.</v>

3694
02:41:43.510 --> 02:41:48.510
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think through a lot of times they </v>

3695
02:41:48.510 --> 02:41:48.510
<v Speaker 4>could do listeners surveys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

3696
02:41:48.510 --> 02:41:49.500
<v Speaker 4>which I guess work like arbitron </v>
<v Speaker 4>diaries,</v>

3697
02:41:49.501 --> 02:41:50.370
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3698
02:41:50.430 --> 02:41:51.690
<v Speaker 4>So antiquated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

3699
02:41:51.790 --> 02:41:54.690
<v Speaker 4>That's shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do I really think that if you weren't on</v>

3700
02:41:54.691 --> 02:41:59.691
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would have the biggest fucking </v>

3701
02:41:59.691 --> 02:41:59.691
<v Speaker 4>podcast in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>

3702
02:41:59.691 --> 02:41:59.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you'd have a huge podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I've been,</v>

3703
02:41:59.870 --> 02:42:00.550
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

3704
02:42:00.551 --> 02:42:01.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm not fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really mean like,</v>

3705
02:42:01.621 --> 02:42:03.210
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I'm boring when I talked to </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot.</v>

3706
02:42:03.211 --> 02:42:08.211
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't I fuck it wouldn't be out of my </v>

3707
02:42:08.211 --> 02:42:08.211
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to snipe.</v>

3708
02:42:08.211 --> 02:42:11.091
<v Speaker 4>I like to fucking sit there and watch </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking Greg and Tony do the heavy </v>

3709
02:42:11.091 --> 02:42:11.970
<v Speaker 4>lifting and I pipe in with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

3710
02:42:11.971 --> 02:42:14.310
<v Speaker 4>the fucking quick shot or I fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the,</v>

3711
02:42:14.311 --> 02:42:16.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm the fucking sniper and full metal </v>
<v Speaker 4>jacket.</v>

3712
02:42:16.530 --> 02:42:21.530
<v Speaker 4>I'll just shoot a few bullets and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>sit back and let them do the heavy </v>

3713
02:42:21.530 --> 02:42:21.530
<v Speaker 4>lifting and I liked that.</v>

3714
02:42:21.530 --> 02:42:21.850
<v Speaker 4>Well you guys have a great relationship </v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

3715
02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:23.340
<v Speaker 4>You guys have been doing it together so </v>
<v Speaker 4>long,</v>

3716
02:42:23.370 --> 02:42:25.410
<v Speaker 4>but I think if the three of you build </v>
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>

3717
02:42:25.740 --> 02:42:27.210
<v Speaker 4>it would just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could still.</v>

3718
02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:29.700
<v Speaker 4>I think you could maintain the exact </v>
<v Speaker 4>same amount of income.</v>

3719
02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:33.060
<v Speaker 4>I think it'd be the exact same amount of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people listening if not more,</v>

3720
02:42:33.290 --> 02:42:38.290
<v Speaker 4>just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the future being Anthony </v>

3721
02:42:38.290 --> 02:42:38.290
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3722
02:42:38.290 --> 02:42:38.750
<v Speaker 4>I was just about bringing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

3723
02:42:38.780 --> 02:42:40.100
<v Speaker 4>we do the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3724
02:42:40.101 --> 02:42:41.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and how does that work?</v>

3725
02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:47.000
<v Speaker 4>They just go on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's on itunes and a lot of times it's </v>

3726
02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:47.390
<v Speaker 4>best of the week plus a couple of old </v>
<v Speaker 4>bits are a part.</v>

3727
02:42:47.820 --> 02:42:49.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an old bit in there.</v>

3728
02:42:49.270 --> 02:42:54.270
<v Speaker 4>It's basically just to get people </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they don't want to give away </v>

3729
02:42:54.270 --> 02:42:57.081
<v Speaker 4>content either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just to get people who have heard </v>

3730
02:42:57.081 --> 02:42:57.540
<v Speaker 4>of the show to check it out and see if </v>
<v Speaker 4>they like it.</v>

3731
02:42:57.800 --> 02:43:00.360
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of times the fans already have</v>

3732
02:43:00.390 --> 02:43:02.010
<v Speaker 4>the content because they've heard it </v>
<v Speaker 4>already.</v>

3733
02:43:02.430 --> 02:43:03.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell you this man,</v>

3734
02:43:03.721 --> 02:43:08.721
<v Speaker 4>if it wasn't for you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I would've ever started a </v>

3735
02:43:08.721 --> 02:43:11.421
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if it wasn't for Anthony Anthony </v>

3736
02:43:11.421 --> 02:43:12.400
<v Speaker 4>doing live from the compound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian and I would've never started doing</v>

3737
02:43:12.401 --> 02:43:17.401
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ustream show this show that kind of </v>

3738
02:43:17.401 --> 02:43:17.401
<v Speaker 4>started it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And before that,</v>

3739
02:43:17.401 --> 02:43:18.040
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the Justin TV.</v>

3740
02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:19.690
<v Speaker 4>We did a few of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3741
02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:21.130
<v Speaker 4>we did a few of those in the green </v>
<v Speaker 4>rooms.</v>

3742
02:43:21.131 --> 02:43:23.830
<v Speaker 4>Like we kind of had an idea of doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like this a long time ago.</v>

3743
02:43:23.831 --> 02:43:28.831
<v Speaker 4>But seeing anthony do it from his place </v>
<v Speaker 4>really motivated me because anthony set </v>

3744
02:43:28.831 --> 02:43:33.821
<v Speaker 4>up a green screen and put a professional</v>
<v Speaker 4>desk in there and had professional </v>

3745
02:43:33.821 --> 02:43:35.770
<v Speaker 4>microphones and cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he really went balls out.</v>

3746
02:43:35.890 --> 02:43:40.890
<v Speaker 4>He told me he spent like a stupid amount</v>
<v Speaker 4>of money to convert the downstairs of </v>

3747
02:43:40.890 --> 02:43:41.320
<v Speaker 4>his house until the recording studio.</v>

3748
02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:45.310
<v Speaker 4>And this is a guy already has a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>full time gig and if you never seen live</v>

3749
02:43:45.311 --> 02:43:50.311
<v Speaker 4>for the compound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did some with his ex girlfriend </v>

3750
02:43:50.311 --> 02:43:52.360
<v Speaker 4>Melissa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where he would get fucking shit faced.</v>

3751
02:43:52.361 --> 02:43:57.361
<v Speaker 4>Hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would do karaoke while holding a </v>

3752
02:43:57.361 --> 02:43:57.361
<v Speaker 4>machine gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3753
02:43:57.361 --> 02:44:00.970
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was hammered and he would take calls.</v>

3754
02:44:01.060 --> 02:44:03.850
<v Speaker 4>I called him once he was on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was watching.</v>

3755
02:44:03.851 --> 02:44:05.080
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is amazing.</v>

3756
02:44:05.081 --> 02:44:07.150
<v Speaker 4>And he was just hammered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hammered,</v>

3757
02:44:07.151 --> 02:44:09.130
<v Speaker 4>drinking wine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holding it up,</v>

3758
02:44:09.610 --> 02:44:14.610
<v Speaker 4>loving it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the fun thing is the accomplished </v>

3759
02:44:14.610 --> 02:44:14.610
<v Speaker 4>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he built that studio.</v>

3760
02:44:14.610 --> 02:44:14.680
<v Speaker 4>All this while,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

3761
02:44:14.681 --> 02:44:19.681
<v Speaker 4>doing a full time Gig and drinking like </v>
<v Speaker 4>William Holden and I'm fucking jerking </v>

3762
02:44:19.681 --> 02:44:20.670
<v Speaker 4>off and I can't get myself to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivated like that.</v>

3763
02:44:20.810 --> 02:44:22.520
<v Speaker 4>That's humiliating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like.</v>

3764
02:44:22.740 --> 02:44:25.180
<v Speaker 4>And I've watched anthony build that </v>
<v Speaker 4>studio and I'm like,</v>

3765
02:44:25.181 --> 02:44:28.000
<v Speaker 4>look at what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't even rearrange my apartment.</v>

3766
02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.370
<v Speaker 4>I fucking just stagnate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Start and don't finish.</v>

3767
02:44:30.371 --> 02:44:32.290
<v Speaker 4>Start and don't finish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Start and don't finish it.</v>

3768
02:44:32.291 --> 02:44:33.310
<v Speaker 4>I fucking hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3769
02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:36.380
<v Speaker 4>I had always had this idea to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that when,</v>

3770
02:44:36.460 --> 02:44:38.620
<v Speaker 4>after seeing him do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did his,</v>

3771
02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:41.650
<v Speaker 4>his thing was so interesting because at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time when he was doing that,</v>

3772
02:44:41.651 --> 02:44:45.010
<v Speaker 4>nobody was doing something live on </v>
<v Speaker 4>ustream.</v>

3773
02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:50.160
<v Speaker 4>Like professionally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would like have different </v>

3774
02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:50.160
<v Speaker 4>backgrounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3775
02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:53.911
<v Speaker 4>he could have a background that was like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the city because the green screen it </v>

3776
02:44:53.911 --> 02:44:54.400
<v Speaker 4>gets switched the background and turn </v>
<v Speaker 4>into whatever the fuck he wanted,</v>

3777
02:44:54.401 --> 02:44:56.560
<v Speaker 4>which was so bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a great idea.</v>

3778
02:44:56.561 --> 02:45:01.561
<v Speaker 4>And he know when he does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he eventually just turns it on and </v>

3779
02:45:01.561 --> 02:45:03.991
<v Speaker 4>pots up the mix anytime he wants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just goes downstairs and hits the </v>

3780
02:45:03.991 --> 02:45:04.180
<v Speaker 4>switch and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3781
02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:05.220
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3782
02:45:05.290 --> 02:45:10.290
<v Speaker 4>Brian set up the place of the ice house </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's like the natural progression </v>

3783
02:45:10.290 --> 02:45:10.290
<v Speaker 4>of setting this place up.</v>

3784
02:45:10.290 --> 02:45:12.310
<v Speaker 4>I need a technical partnership with </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody.</v>

3785
02:45:12.311 --> 02:45:16.120
<v Speaker 4>I need somebody in New York who can </v>
<v Speaker 4>technically box idea.</v>

3786
02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:17.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously.</v>

3787
02:45:17.081 --> 02:45:22.081
<v Speaker 4>But then Richard intellectually just </v>
<v Speaker 4>take it and make it so much better as </v>

3788
02:45:22.081 --> 02:45:24.250
<v Speaker 4>well as intellectual dominated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What can't serious.</v>

3789
02:45:24.251 --> 02:45:26.140
<v Speaker 4>Don't they have sound guys?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean with that.</v>

3790
02:45:26.141 --> 02:45:27.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with somebody's independence,</v>

3791
02:45:27.331 --> 02:45:28.200
<v Speaker 4>like if I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I want it,</v>

<v Speaker 4>far as I want to do it on and let it </v>

3797

3798
02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:42.670
<v Speaker 4>It was beginning to cause me great pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a secret.</v>

3799
02:45:45.190 --> 02:45:50.190
<v Speaker 4>So I would like to do that.</v>

3809
02:46:11.110 --> 02:46:16.110
<v Speaker 4>It's really fun to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to Ben Kingsley on time </v>

3810
02:46:16.110 --> 02:46:16.110
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well how great is this?</v>

3811
02:46:16.110 --> 02:46:20.831
<v Speaker 4>He has to answer my questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I bumped into him in a fucking Oscar </v>

3812
02:46:20.831 --> 02:46:20.831
<v Speaker 4>party,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd spit on me,</v>

3813
02:46:21.020 --> 02:46:22.210
<v Speaker 4>but here he is sitting next to me.</v>

3814
02:46:22.250 --> 02:46:23.100
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

3815
02:46:23.130 --> 02:46:24.770
<v Speaker 4>Answering because he doesn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at it.</v>

3816
02:46:24.771 --> 02:46:26.490
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's the cool part about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3817
02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:31.600
<v Speaker 4>and especially if they come in </v>
<v Speaker 4>specifically to sit down with you for x </v>

3818
02:46:31.600 --> 02:46:32.260
<v Speaker 4>amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3819
02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:37.480
<v Speaker 4>you could really dig into somebody if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking to them for an hour or </v>

3820
02:46:37.480 --> 02:46:37.650
<v Speaker 4>two hours or whatever it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3821
02:46:37.651 --> 02:46:38.390
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

3822
02:46:38.420 --> 02:46:43.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be great if you did like a Bob </v>

3823
02:46:43.420 --> 02:46:45.640
<v Speaker 4>Costas type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are Bob Costas had later with Bob </v>

3824
02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:45.640
<v Speaker 4>Costas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3825
02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:49.660
<v Speaker 4>And he just was just real simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that Kim at a desk with a person or </v>

3826
02:46:49.660 --> 02:46:50.600
<v Speaker 4>sit down with them for a full hour?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3827
02:46:50.750 --> 02:46:55.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could hold the audience for an </v>

3828
02:46:55.750 --> 02:46:55.750
<v Speaker 4>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to do sketches to that.</v>

3829
02:46:55.750 --> 02:46:55.970
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate like I have some things I </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to do.</v>

3830
02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.800
<v Speaker 4>So you want to essentially host the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tonight show type situation,</v>

3831
02:46:58.850 --> 02:47:01.160
<v Speaker 4>but nothing that quite that structured </v>
<v Speaker 4>or that,</v>

3832
02:47:01.610 --> 02:47:02.150
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

3833
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:07.150
<v Speaker 4>It would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would have to have a much different </v>

3834
02:47:07.150 --> 02:47:08.861
<v Speaker 4>feeling than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But would you want to do it like </v>

<v Speaker 4>showtime style uncensored?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>where there are a couple of language </v>

3840
02:47:19.290 --> 02:47:19.650
<v Speaker 4>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not many millions channels.</v>

02:47:19.670 --> 02:47:24.670
<v Speaker 4>Now they're starting to open up and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of people don't realize the FCC </v>

3842
02:47:24.670 --> 02:47:26.480
<v Speaker 4>doesn't control cable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They only control broadcast television,</v>

3843
02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:28.280
<v Speaker 4>NBC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>CBS,</v>

3844
02:47:28.330 --> 02:47:29.300
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of shit.</v>

3845
02:47:29.630 --> 02:47:34.630
<v Speaker 4>When you get to cable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they essentially self-impose </v>

3846
02:47:34.630 --> 02:47:34.630
<v Speaker 4>advertisers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>say shit and asshole and everybody was </v>

<v Speaker 4>but they can.</v>

<v Speaker 4>me you'll like this if you ever see the </v>

3855

<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3897
02:49:26.600 --> 02:49:27.460
<v Speaker 1>west.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was,</v>

3898
02:49:27.790 --> 02:49:30.090

<v Speaker 1>was really important that you did it.</v>

02:49:30.320 --> 02:49:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I actually liked her too.</v>

3900
02:49:32.010 --> 02:49:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I genuinely liked her and we talked </v>

3901
02:49:37.010 --> 02:49:37.010
<v Speaker 1>after on the following and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually really nice.</v>

3902
02:49:37.010 --> 02:49:38.580
<v Speaker 1>She's not some psychotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3903
02:49:38.630 --> 02:49:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I think that a lot of our takes on these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3904
02:49:41.130 --> 02:49:46.130
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the interaction that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a blog to blog or twitter </v>

3905
02:49:46.130 --> 02:49:46.130
<v Speaker 1>to twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3906
02:49:46.130 --> 02:49:47.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a limited way of communicating</v>

3907
02:49:47.711 --> 02:49:51.210
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of these same people that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have disagreements with online.</v>

3908
02:49:51.210 --> 02:49:56.210
<v Speaker 1>If we sat down with them in a rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of normal setting like this and </v>

3909
02:49:56.210 --> 02:50:00.171
<v Speaker 1>just talked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd probably see each other's point a </v>

3910
02:50:00.171 --> 02:50:02.901
<v Speaker 1>lot better and have like some healthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions about these things as </v>

3911
02:50:02.901 --> 02:50:07.011
<v Speaker 1>opposed to these like these snipe </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks that people like to do in blogs </v>

3912
02:50:07.011 --> 02:50:09.510
<v Speaker 1>and twitter and go back and forth with </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

3913
02:50:09.511 --> 02:50:14.511
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot missing in those one way </v>

3914
02:50:14.511 --> 02:50:17.631
<v Speaker 1>interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I say something and then you say </v>

3915
02:50:17.631 --> 02:50:17.631
<v Speaker 1>something and you know when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with each other,</v>

3916
02:50:17.631 --> 02:50:22.461
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get to know someone a lot </v>

3917
02:50:22.461 --> 02:50:23.940
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I liked that conversation was</v>

3918
02:50:24.300 --> 02:50:26.610
<v Speaker 1>you could tell there was some real </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse going on there,</v>

3919
02:50:27.480 --> 02:50:29.610
<v Speaker 1>which regardless of which side you take.</v>
