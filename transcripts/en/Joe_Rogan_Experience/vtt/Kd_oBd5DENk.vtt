<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience of Decorah.</v>

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I did a karate Guy Story to street karate guy.</v>

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.880
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>This is a funny story.</v>

5
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.111
<v Speaker 1>We're at,</v>

7
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:10.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.161
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

9
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:11.994
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Kimbo has to fight and um,</v>

11
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.920
<v Speaker 1>before the fight would go to a tap out party and those people are there.</v>

12
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:21.030
<v Speaker 1>And then these guys,</v>

13
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>he stuff guys that they're one of us,</v>

14
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>I think selling jewelry or something and he was with a bunch of guys and,</v>

15
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.560
<v Speaker 1>and from the guys,</v>

16
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.320
<v Speaker 1>I think he was the toughest guy.</v>

17
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.281
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

18
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

19
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.430
<v Speaker 1>we're talking and of course you know it,</v>

20
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't know who I was.</v>

21
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:33.660
<v Speaker 1>So that was the best thing.</v>

22
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.860
<v Speaker 1>And that people were talking about finding a,</v>

23
00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>suddenly he comes to fourth and he goes,</v>

24
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.023
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

25
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>I used to do a karate.</v>

26
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.251
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

27
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>but not a normal cardiac goes to do street karate.</v>

28
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.101
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

90
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>he gets back to contact with me and it stops,</v>

91
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:00.414
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92

<v Speaker 1>you practiced this in the mirror and it looks really cool,</v>

99
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>but you never did this.</v>

100
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

101
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.000

<v Speaker 1>It was his glory.</v>

107
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>And then when at the moment I said,</v>

108
00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:23.994
<v Speaker 1>total bullshit.</v>

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:31.510
<v Speaker 1>But the fact the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the facial expression from all those guys,</v>

117
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:36.720
<v Speaker 1>they're all dressed the same.</v>

118
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.910

<v Speaker 1>Express the streets.</v>

124
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:45.721
<v Speaker 1>Karate guy.</v>

125
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>His routine saves his life seven times,</v>

126
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>and they tell me they extreme that you believe that crap.</v>

128
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>It was the most insane thing I've ever seen.</v>

129
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 1>And I did it.</v>

130
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>And then here comes the boom you remember had but need to the face throwaway</v>

136
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.471
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

137
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 2>this is a true story.</v>

138
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Somebody told me this technique,</v>

139

<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of those knuckleheads,</v>

140
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.301

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.230
<v Speaker 2>They're like fake karate guys.</v>

143
00:03:13.231 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

144
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 2>the worst part is they say,</v>

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.701
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

146
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 2>we cannot use it in the ring because it's way too dangerous.</v>

147
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.791
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

148
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 2>well if you could kill somebody like this,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean what?</v>

152
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean they kind of control that kind of control or you just,</v>

153
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 2>a techniques are too lethal boss.</v>

154
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm standing there like it's like dropping a nuclear explosion on</v>

155
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

156
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

157
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 2>The one inspiring shoulder.</v>

158
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

159
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 2>I love those videos.</v>

160
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 2>Like Kung Fu videos or grass at demonstrating techniques and how they're going</v>

161
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 2>to work.</v>

162
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 2>And have you seen the one where the old man who's got this class where he throws</v>

163
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 2>like people and then a karate guy,</v>

164
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 2>Pankratz guy comes in and beats the shit out of all the shit out of him.</v>

165
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.680
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

166
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.920
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

167
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

168
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 2>you see him bleed.</v>

169
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:53.381
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

170
00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 2>he's seeing himself.</v>

171
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 2>He cannot believe it.</v>

172
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.373
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work.</v>

173
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 2>He's trying.</v>

174
00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.321
<v Speaker 2>The one guy,</v>

175
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 2>he does take it to get to get the guy goes,</v>

176
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

177
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 2>He goes and he makes a somersault and he falls under ground.</v>

178
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like he believed his own bullshit.</v>

179
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

180
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.590
<v Speaker 2>What are these guys doing?</v>

181
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.520
<v Speaker 2>They're all faking it.</v>

182
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 2>They know they are,</v>

183
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 2>but they're probably,</v>

184
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 2>it's like mass hypnosis or mass hysteria,</v>

185
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

186
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 2>like cult behavior.</v>

187
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 2>They get locked into believing.</v>

188
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:20.480
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember when I was in my,</v>

189
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 2>my taekwondo school was not like cultish in the sense,</v>

190
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:25.061
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>

191
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:26.590
<v Speaker 2>nobody had to do anything crazy.</v>

192
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 2>They didn't try to get your money or get you to leave your family or anything</v>

193
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:29.921
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

194
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 2>But the devotion that some people had towards the instructor was a pretty crazy,</v>

195
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing and they didn't exploit it,</v>

196
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 2>but if someone did exploited,</v>

197
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 2>you could see that how they could get some weak people that would really fall</v>

198
00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:42.641
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

199
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:43.160
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

200
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.810
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of a disturbing aspect of martial arts that I,</v>

201
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I really loved about Brazilian Jujitsu was that you</v>

202
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 2>didn't kind of see that you didn't see like all the bowing.</v>

203
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 2>It was more like friendly.</v>

204
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Like when I trained with the Machados like,</v>

205
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 2>hey my friend,</v>

206
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:56.674
<v Speaker 2>how are you?</v>

207
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 2>And it was much once they show you the techniques,</v>

208
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 2>but they're very friendly and more,</v>

209
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.433
<v Speaker 2>more like,</v>

210
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

211
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

212
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:06.160
<v Speaker 2>they don't try to place themselves above anyone.</v>

213
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:07.390
<v Speaker 2>There's no master though,</v>

214
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.233
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

215
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.760
<v Speaker 2>they're going to let you know that it is really effective right there and there</v>

216
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 2>on the respect that you get from them.</v>

217
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.461
<v Speaker 2>You'll,</v>

218
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 2>they'll earn it just by being amazing.</v>

219
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.940
<v Speaker 2>But it's because they're good.</v>

220
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.791
<v Speaker 2>All the other guys,</v>

221
00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 2>she'll preach and talk about it like that.</v>

222
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.061
<v Speaker 2>They're not good.</v>

223
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 2>They suck.</v>

224
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Like every guy who tells me that he is unbelievable,</v>

225
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Speaker 2>but he never fought.</v>

226
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 2>It's full of Shit.</v>

227
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.691
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

228
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 2>you know how many times indeed it's not possible.</v>

229
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 2>You never,</v>

230
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 2>he will not know if he can do it under pressure.</v>

231
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:36.244
<v Speaker 2>He will not.</v>

232
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.150
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

233
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 2>Do you know when you guys have told me though that they could never lose?</v>

234
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.680
<v Speaker 2>I never lose money.</v>

235
00:05:40.681 --> 00:05:41.990
<v Speaker 2>You don't know about my mentality.</v>

236
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Palatine yelling,</v>

237
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:44.410
<v Speaker 2>get choked.</v>

238
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm like an animal,</v>

239
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:45.671
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

240

241
00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:49.241

242
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:50.280
<v Speaker 2>It's done dropping.</v>

243
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.181

246
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

247
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.580
<v Speaker 2>That's the easiest.</v>

248
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't named Jess coming into my class one time.</v>

249
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

250
00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm no kidding.</v>

251
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy walking in with the stash glasses and a big belly and a blue blue</v>

252
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:10.880
<v Speaker 1>chemo knows and they came in my NGO in Holland and he walked in,</v>

253
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 1>there was six girls following him.</v>

254
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 1>It was like a cult.</v>

255
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:14.880
<v Speaker 1>It was the weirdest thing ever.</v>

256
00:06:14.881 --> 00:06:17.320
<v Speaker 1>And later on we find out he could even like a pushups.</v>

257
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>It was like bizarre.</v>

258
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>And every time when I was show something,</v>

259
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>they would say something like one time,</v>

260
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

261
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

262
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I had an arm bar and this girl says,</v>

263
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.481
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

264
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 1>we would bite and the leg,</v>

265
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

266
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 1>so I started slowly but surely,</v>

267
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 1>I figure I'm not gonna say anything,</v>

268
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.601
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>

269
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:32.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 1>it kept going,</v>

271
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 1>kept going and have somebody in a rear naked choke.</v>

272
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.560
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

273
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 1>what's up and explaining as she goes to somebody else.</v>

274
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>

275
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.530
<v Speaker 1>we were Boogie.</v>

276
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.901
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

277
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:42.141
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

278
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:42.610
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

279
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.950
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

282
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.090
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

283
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 1>we will poke your eyes out right now.</v>

284
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.571
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

285
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:48.404

00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 1>put my arm around her neck.</v>

295
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.781

00:07:50.591 --> 00:07:50.701
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

339
00:07:50.701 --> 00:07:52.290
<v Speaker 2>if someone has a rear naked choke on you,</v>

340
00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:54.200
<v Speaker 2>especially if you don't really know defense.</v>

341
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:55.530
<v Speaker 2>He haven't been choked a lot before.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work.</v>

399
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.030

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.080
<v Speaker 1>They could knock you out.</v>

403
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.100
<v Speaker 1>I got a great story,</v>

00:09:43.931 --> 00:09:44.830
<v Speaker 1>I'd looked into gamma.</v>

407
00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:45.271
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

408
00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:45.670
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

409

410
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.710
<v Speaker 1>if you have a person who gets,</v>

411
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:55.360
<v Speaker 1>who says that he can knock me out with a punch like it just pressing somewhere.</v>

412
00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.710
<v Speaker 1>We invite him,</v>

413
00:09:56.711 --> 00:09:57.610

417
00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:02.920
<v Speaker 1>He can knock me out.</v>

418
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:03.341
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

419
00:10:03.341 --> 00:10:05.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a no lose situation for me because if it works,</v>

420
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm signing up to do that stuff.</v>

421
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.750
<v Speaker 1>But I tell you it's not going to work.</v>

422
00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.220

00:10:12.221 --> 00:10:13.500
<v Speaker 1>you know a mirror Pareto.</v>

424
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.770
<v Speaker 1>You know most of where my buddy,</v>

425
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.870
<v Speaker 1>we see these guys on stage and the touch guys,</v>

426
00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:20.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

427
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:21.370
<v Speaker 1>So one guy goes,</v>

428
00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:22.160
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

429
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:22.790
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

430
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:23.171
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>

431
00:10:23.171 --> 00:10:24.004
<v Speaker 1>the person has this.</v>

432
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.050
<v Speaker 1>They just fall back.</v>

433
00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.370
<v Speaker 1>And then the guy said,</v>

434
00:10:27.371 --> 00:10:29.260
<v Speaker 1>did you see his eyes roll back in his skill?</v>

435
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.420
<v Speaker 1>That means you was out for real.</v>

436
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.100
<v Speaker 1>So I'd go to America.</v>

437
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.360
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be fun.</v>

438
00:10:34.361 --> 00:10:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Why is this so these guys,</v>

439
00:10:36.041 --> 00:10:37.760
<v Speaker 1>they come walking down after the set.</v>

440
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:38.051
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

441
00:10:38.051 --> 00:10:38.291
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

442

<v Speaker 1>You wanted him to know couch.</v>

445
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:42.850
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:43.690
<v Speaker 1>are you sure about that?</v>

447

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:47.651

458
00:10:50.021 --> 00:10:51.370

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

499
00:11:41.421 --> 00:11:41.920
<v Speaker 1>because if,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work.</v>

502
00:11:44.991 --> 00:11:46.220
<v Speaker 1>It needs to be that balance.</v>

503
00:11:46.221 --> 00:11:47.480
<v Speaker 1>So I know it was this way out.</v>

504
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.700
<v Speaker 1>So I walked over to him and I'm standing like this.</v>

505
00:11:49.701 --> 00:11:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I say kick me into pills and he says,</v>

506
00:11:52.191 --> 00:11:52.410

509
00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.360
<v Speaker 1>He did want to do it.</v>

510
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.203
<v Speaker 1>Needless to say,</v>

511
00:11:59.410 --> 00:11:59.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

512
00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:02.800
<v Speaker 1>but they're idiots that truly believe that is true.</v>

513
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:03.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

514
00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 1>it's so easy to take someone who doesn't know anything like it was a student and</v>

515
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:08.780
<v Speaker 1>trick them like that and be a con man like that.</v>

516
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.720
<v Speaker 1>And you know what the worst thing is?</v>

517
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:12.100
<v Speaker 1>There's teachers out there,</v>

518
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.630
<v Speaker 1>they give you a false sense of security and then you,</v>

519
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.210
<v Speaker 1>they teach you how to defend a knife,</v>

520
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:16.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

521
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:17.231
<v Speaker 1>grabbing the wrist.</v>

522
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

523
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.160
<v Speaker 1>never did.</v>

524
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's so dangerous.</v>

525
00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Knife is dangerous than a gun on a short distance.</v>

526
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:24.130
<v Speaker 1>At least they teach them the wrong way.</v>

527
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:25.960
<v Speaker 1>And then something happens on the street.</v>

528
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Somebody pulls a knife and he goes to his buddy,</v>

529
00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:28.141
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

530
00:12:28.141 --> 00:12:28.780
<v Speaker 1>it's that bag.</v>

531
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.560
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

532
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:29.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

533
00:12:29.811 --> 00:12:30.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

534
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.143
<v Speaker 1>and they get killed.</v>

535
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo has a crazy story about that guy's fault.</v>

536
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:34.834
<v Speaker 1>It's theirs.</v>

537
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
