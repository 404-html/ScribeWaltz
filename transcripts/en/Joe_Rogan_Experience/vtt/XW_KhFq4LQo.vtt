1
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.320
Here we go in five,
four,
three,
two,
one.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.580
Yes,
at all.

3
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.090
The fucking people that make me feel lazy in this world is to make me feel you

4
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.260
in the rock.
You fuckers don't look like.
Do you ever sleep?
Not Enough.

5
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.950
No days off.
That's what I love is unattractive as he's,
uh,

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.140
he's a,
he's a person that,
that motivates me,

7
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.580
inspires me in the fact that where we're coworkers,
we're friends.

8
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.330
Um,
I think it's a,
I think it's like a,
it's a blessing.

9
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.710
It's a blessing to be around that because it truly,
it's,
it's uplifting.
You know,

10
00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:44.140
it makes you,
it just makes you weed out to circle.

11
00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:48.060
When you're around people that truly give you,
like,
uh,

12
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.810
give you some good,
serve a good value to you and your life,

13
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.640
you then look at those that don't,
and you can,
you can then push away.

14
00:00:57.641 --> 00:01:01.870
So I'm big on,
I'm big on personality.

15
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.860
I'm big on energy.
I'm big on will.
And once,

16
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.070
uh,
I believe that is contagious.
So if you have a,

17
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.680
a bunch of laziness and a bunch of bullshit around you,

18
00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:12.820
naturally it's going to feed off.

19
00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:15.640
You're going to find yourself becoming what's in your environment.

20
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.810
So I feel the exact same way.
And when I see it though,
can I see that in you?

21
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.790
I see that in,
you know,
so I feel like it's a scene that Avatar I see you.

22
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.390
I see you.
Yeah,
but a guy like that,
I was like,

23
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.850
I always wonder like how much of that is like I've had sleep experts on the

24
00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:33.700
podcast and tell you like,
like this real problems.

25
00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:35.320
If you don't get enough sleep like you could,

26
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.890
you have a much higher risk of Alzheimer's.
All those other serious issues.

27
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.280
But I see a guy like the rock,
I'm like,
how the fuck does he sleep?
Well,

28
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.090
where's the room to fall asleep?
You know that,
that's true.
I can't say that,
um,

29
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.190
that I've witnessed the sleep patterns,
but he's a,
he's a late ass,

30
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.410
so he does,
I know he's sleeping is something,

31
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.210
where are we waiting on DJ?
God Damn it.
He's probably getting his rest,

32
00:02:01.211 --> 00:02:03.940
which is well deserved.
Um,
but you know when you,

33
00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:06.070
when you say you had these sleep experts and stuff on,

34
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.900
it's always a thing that I go back and forth about it because what is enough

35
00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:12.070
sleep like I'm a person.

36
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.810
I function high off of six to seven hours.

37
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.520
Yeah.
Six seven hours.
I'm,
I'm functioning.
Yeah,
five hours.

38
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.910
I'm great.
Do I do the five hour thing all the time?
No,

39
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.980
but if I have to I'm fine.
Um,
I don't need the eight and a nine.

40
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.310
I thought like that's too much for me.
Like I'm,
I'm,

41
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.940
I'm an early riser and now that I'm getting older,
you know,

42
00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:41.410
if I can get in that bed by nine 30 or 10 on a off work day,

43
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.340
I'm very happy with that.
But then I'm up at five 30 I'm up at five.

44
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.590
So what is enough sleep?
What did they tell you is enough?

45
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.060
It really depends on the person.

46
00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:52.600
There are people that have a gene where they can just sleep four hours a night.

47
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.930
I got fine.
You might got it.
I got that.
Is that a,
does it,
what does that,

48
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.280
what does that mean?
Motherhood is gold.
What does that,
what does it means?

49
00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:02.670
You've got special jeans day.
Write a mail.
He got some shit.
There are,

50
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.350
there are people that just don't need as much.
They can,

51
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.990
they can go a long time without sleep.
Diagnosed me,

52
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:09.820
I'm one of those people he brought in.
You might be,

53
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.930
I bet a lot of high functioning people are because your body tends to get more

54
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:18.210
efficient.
You know,
like you're,
you're always going,
you're always burning yard.

55
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.220
So your body's like,
when it's time to shut down,
it's like shut down.

56
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.140
Get that five,
six hours in.
All right.
I will,
I will confess this.

57
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.000
I am an amazing Catnapper.
Uh,
yeah,
I'm,

58
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:35.620
I'm,
I'm one of those guys.
If you stop talking to me long enough,

59
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.160
I'm a fault slip right here.

60
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.020
I something about silence real and just not doing anything and I just,
well,

61
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:46.840
it's probably,
you're probably going on momentum all the time.
You probably,

62
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:49.060
you're probably going on motivation and momentum.

63
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.730
Then when your body has his break,
he probably was like,

64
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.860
we could use a little sleep right here at 100% right.
I'm dead serious.
That's,

65
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.920
I know for sure that that's accurate because I'm,
how can happen heartbeat.

66
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.320
Do you feel like you've hit a good balance?

67
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:05.230
So this is what I was wondering about with guys like you are guys like the rock.

68
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:07.030
When I look at your Instagram,
your social media,

69
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:09.040
and you're just constantly going like,
God damn.

70
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.920
Do you ever feel like you do too much?

71
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:15.160
Like maybe I just need to take a little break here.
Do you ever feel like that?

72
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.960
I think the perception definitely perceives reality.
You know,
uh,

73
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.020
what it looks like so much isn't always so much because you have a schedule and

74
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.561
you know,

75
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:31.561
within that schedule there's the things that mean the most that come and act as

76
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:35.560
downtime.
You know,

77
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.500
me and my house is downtime even though it's still active and I've got to be dad

78
00:04:40.501 --> 00:04:44.200
and I'm with the kids and a wife in this conversation and I'm running around in

79
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:47.020
the back and forth.
That's still acts as downtime for me.

80
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.060
Like I'm shutting a work off.
So the phone is any office,

81
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:56.770
I'm not going back to get it until the morning.
And it's all conversation.

82
00:04:56.771 --> 00:05:00.190
It's all TV,
it's all Taco Tuesdays.

83
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.840
It's couching Cuddlin uh,
you know,
baby time,
whatever.

84
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.060
That's my downtime because,
um,

85
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.190
I've taken a step outside of the other shit that's was,
that's,

86
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:16.930
that's what I think I do very well.
I can step outside the other shit.

87
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:21.070
I can separate it.
So I think when you're able to do that,
then you're,

88
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:24.100
you're managing your mental,
you know what I mean?
Like if it's,

89
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.500
if it's always one thing all the time,

90
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.290
that's how you fucking drive yourself crazy because you'd never,

91
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.880
you'd never shutting it off.
Yeah.
And I think I do a good job of shutting,

92
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.710
shutting this off in focusing on this.
Like when I'm with my family,

93
00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:42.370
I want my family.
Nothing is,
nothing interjects or comes in between.

94
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.720
That's fantastic.
That's so important.
It's 100%.
That's beautiful.

95
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.070
That's gigantic.
I think I figured it out.
That's it,
man.
I think I figured it out.

96
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.170
You mean you've got so much success?

97
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:56.140
It's not like you have to be with that fucking phone all the time.

98
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.070
It's that the phone is the big one

99
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.000
<v 2>right on the phone.
The phone is,
is the gift and a curse.
You know,</v>

100
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:05.960
I think that we,
we shot out the gate and saw the Gif.

101
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.700
Oh my God.
It's,
it's,
it's community is connecting us.
We're able to share,

102
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.530
we're able to meet new people where we're able to stay in communication with,

103
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.490
with old people,
find new people as entertainer.

104
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.290
I can engage with my fans and this is so dope.
And then after that,

105
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.550
you get hit with the,
the curse.
And the curse is,
there's a,

106
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.140
there's a high level of negativity that's out there that's on that shit.

107
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.370
You know,
there's,
there's a lot of people that are,
you know,

108
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.530
not happy or,

109
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.070
or going through things and they interject,
uh,

110
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.110
a certain amount of negativity and hatred through these devices.

111
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.830
These devices are the easiest way to touch everybody.

112
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.130
So when you're just consumed on that shit all day,

113
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.360
you start to see yourself being a part of the negative shit.

114
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.350
So what I've learned to do is go,
I don't,
I don't need to see that.

115
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.380
I don't need to see that shit.
I don't,
I don't pay that any mind.

116
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.770
I don't read that Shit for what?
It's not,
it's not helping me.

117
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:13.970
It's not making me better.
It's not,
it's not a pushing me to new limits.

118
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.650
If anything is taken up,

119
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:20.651
just creative space by me literally spending time going and,

120
00:07:21.071 --> 00:07:23.800
and,
and navigating through what I think is,

121
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.070
is a bunch of bullshit so I don't let the device beat me.

122
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:31.490
And at one point I definitely did.
At one point it was everything.

123
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.030
It was everything.
It was,
you know,
now separated.

124
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:39.440
I'm not clear of it would work when you realize what it is,
when you see,

125
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.910
when you see the bed,
you know when you see the bad side of it.

126
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.400
I thought the other day this is some real shit and it really made me think my

127
00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:50.234
phone died,

128
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.550
my phone died and I'm driving and I was using the fucking maps and I was like,

129
00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:57.870
Oh shit,
what the fuck?

130
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.670
How am I get to where I don't know where I'm going.
And I sat and I was like,
Yo,

131
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:02.504
how did we,

132
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.460
how did we get from point a to point B before the map shit.

133
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:12.140
What are we doing that I used to print out directions from Google maps.

134
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:14.300
I remember that,
but then before that,

135
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:18.140
how did you get to the places where you were going that you didn't know how to

136
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:21.260
get to?
I don't even remember.
Do you remember Thomas Guides?

137
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:23.690
Do you ever have a Thomas Guide?
I did have a Thomas Guide.

138
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.340
When I first moved to la I would get one of them.

139
00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:29.590
I did have a Thomas Guide giant ask a hundred percent bill burr had

140
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.580
bill probably still uses it.
Shouts out to bill burr,

141
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.620
but it really fucked me up because I was like,
how do we don't even know how,

142
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.080
how to do the common,

143
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.480
the the the norm anymore because the device has made everything available and I

144
00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:52.961
literally had to to drive to a store rack it,

145
00:08:53.031 --> 00:08:58.031
buy a charger to charge up my phone to get back and use the mat to get to where

146
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:01.230
the fuck I was going.
I said I had no idea how to get there.
I had no,

147
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:02.670
I didn't know know numbers by heart.

148
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.510
I didn't know who I was going to call like,
Yo,

149
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:10.880
this is the moment where I was like,
what level of success have I reached?

150
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.410
I just pulled over and I sat there and I was like,

151
00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:15.840
how the fuck am I going to get the round goes spare phone man.

152
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.350
I don't know what it would backup phone.
It felt like the end of the world.

153
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.080
It felt,
it felt like it was over.

154
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.110
I was like shit and the crazy head of pen that you are,

155
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:30.140
but that's when the light bulb started to click started.

156
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:33.810
They click like how?
How do we function with out?

157
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.560
I want to go backwards a little bit.
It's still there.
I still need it.

158
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.280
I still think it's dope with all of the things that we can do on it,

159
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.480
but I still want to be able to put it down and step away from it and then my

160
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:48.900
kids to be able to step away from it.
That's why when I come in the house,

161
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.930
my phone was up cause I can't,
I can't bitch.

162
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:54.990
You could plan at y'all about being on your phone if you see me doing the same

163
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:59.700
thing.
Right.
So that time,
those conversations,
me wanting to know about your day,

164
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:04.050
you talking to me about your day,
your friends,
who you like,

165
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:08.170
who don't you like my daughter.
You what boy?
Who?
What?

166
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.270
Ha No,
I got my son.
Yeah,

167
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.150
I like somebody who,
oh,
Jesus.
Here coms.
It's,
yes,

168
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:20.700
it's a great thing and I want to be able to have those moments and you know,

169
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:25.260
I think it's,
it's,
it's big to make sure that you prioritize that.

170
00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.440
Are you worried about what comes next?
100%.

171
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.580
I'm worried that something's going to be way more intrusive than that.
It's,
it's,

172
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.760
what do you mean it's already happening?

173
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.630
The biggest scare happened already with the,
the,

174
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.860
the facetime shit that happened where?
Well Apple,
uh,

175
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.460
on the iPhone it was like people could listen in to your,
oh yeah,

176
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:48.720
if you didn't need to pick up.
Yeah.
They could just listen into it and you know,

177
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:51.360
that was the scariest shit ever because it's,

178
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:54.690
if it's that easy to have a bug like that,

179
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.200
what's the thing that's not a bug that's there that you just don't know about?

180
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.940
Oh there's definitely government listened to us 100% 100% everything everybody

181
00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:06.620
says and then in case one day you do something wrong,
they go back to,

182
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.700
sorry Mr. Hart was like,
you sit down for a minute,

183
00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:13.701
why am I you something hundred percent so the fear is the next level of

184
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:21.090
immersion intrusive.
You know,
I think everything is become intrusive now.

185
00:11:21.091 --> 00:11:23.880
Like the toughest thing for me is that there is no,

186
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.740
there is no privacy outside my home.
You know,

187
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:29.550
the,

188
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:34.050
the amount of money that you have to now spin just on security,

189
00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:36.900
on,
you know,
people to be with me,

190
00:11:36.901 --> 00:11:39.780
security to be on my home.
You know,

191
00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:44.640
it's like there literally is no privacy and it's not a bitch and complain about

192
00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:47.220
it because without the fans,
without the people that support me,

193
00:11:47.221 --> 00:11:51.540
I wouldn't be where I am.
But there is no middle ground.
You know,

194
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.040
there is no handshakes anymore.
It's,

195
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.420
<v 0>it's how you doing.
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah.</v>

196
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.570
The handshake is so much better to get a moment like we didn't talk if that's

197
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:06.571
what you were not an all y'all was saying now it's kind of weird cause you doing

198
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:09.820
this to me,
it's kind of weird to have a conversation.

199
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:14.550
So you're just starting to see yourself become a little older and wiser and uh,

200
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.970
just really see the times for what they are and see the direction that we're

201
00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:23.971
going in this people and just hope and pray that we find a middle ground.

202
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:28.630
Because I think right now there isn't one.
Yeah,
that's what I'm feeling now.
No,

203
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:31.540
I feel it too.
And especially,
I mean,

204
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:35.500
what you're talking about is you being super famous and losing all your privacy,

205
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.760
but everyone's losing their privacy and slowly but surely it's,

206
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:42.700
it's happening to you because you're very famous and because you do something

207
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:45.830
that's in the public eye and people want to see you and they want to stick the

208
00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:46.664
camera in front of you.

209
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.610
But there's gonna come a point in time where what we're dealing with now,

210
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.750
which is like you have to turn your phone on,
you have to,
you know,
yeah.

211
00:12:54.751 --> 00:12:57.450
I have to reach out to somebody.
You have to put something up that's,

212
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.190
that step's going to be out of the way and it's just going to be people being

213
00:13:00.191 --> 00:13:03.580
able to access your life.
Yeah.
Pretty,
you know,
you know,
to bad,

214
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.570
here's what I'll say is bad.
That really fucks with me.

215
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:14.070
I don't like that negativity is the,

216
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.340
the want,
you know,
like,
like the,

217
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.970
the thing that's popular is the failure the fuck up.

218
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:28.300
You know,
the,
the fight that I can catch,

219
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.720
the hateful moment that I can catch and posts like the bad is being highlighted

220
00:13:34.751 --> 00:13:39.610
and celebrated.
That's what fucks with me.
What the social media shit.

221
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:42.610
Now,
what,
what really bothers me is,
you know,

222
00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:46.350
when you see these things online,
like,
you know,
uh,

223
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.620
a fight and there's a man hitting a woman and is captured.
Right.

224
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:51.903
That's bad.

225
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.840
The bad thing is that you watched that the video was more important than the

226
00:13:58.151 --> 00:14:01.930
actual help.
Right.
Or the moment to step in.
And you know,

227
00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:06.090
when you see these things where you're catching people do these things to kids

228
00:14:06.091 --> 00:14:10.330
in this caught the moment of what you got in,

229
00:14:10.331 --> 00:14:15.331
what you want to post and get likes or whatever on is the focus instead of the

230
00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:19.810
help and that,
and that's,
that's the part that is just,

231
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.300
I just have a hard time processing.

232
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:27.360
I have a hard time processing what the likes mean to certain people.

233
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:28.941
Well,

234
00:14:28.941 --> 00:14:33.160
you get an extraordinary amount of attention so it doesn't mean anything to you.

235
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.010
It means something to a regular person.
Went to a regular person,

236
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.610
they can catch some worldstar video and put it up there.
Like,
dude,

237
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.240
that's my video.
That's my video hooked my video,
got 5 million hits,

238
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.350
my video has gone viral,
my videos everywhere.
For them it's like,

239
00:14:47.351 --> 00:14:50.560
it's a point of excitement.
That's why when they see you,
they're like,
oh shit.

240
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.550
How often are they going to run into Kevin Hart

241
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:57.230
<v 2>at Costco or wherever the fuck you were?
Why did to me on a,</v>

242
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.950
you know,
I'm in,
I'm in the bathroom,
um,

243
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.100
restaurant and I go to the bathroom,
you know,

244
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.070
by the way that I went to the bathroom,
you could definitely tell I had to shit.

245
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.530
I was,
I was moving fast.
I was,
you know,
it was one of those bro,

246
00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:13.730
why you eating?
Yeah,

247
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.900
I'm eating bad so I didn't eat bad and while my stomach immediately said this is

248
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:18.740
not going to happen today.

249
00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:24.090
So I get up and I go and literally like,

250
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.660
like three seconds.

251
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.550
I hear it as I'm walking over there go Kevin Hart and as I'm walking by,

252
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.210
a guy gets up,
follows me in the bathroom and he's like,
Yo,

253
00:15:35.211 --> 00:15:38.000
I gotta get a picture man.
And I said,
let me,

254
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.400
let me go to the bathroom when I'm done,
I'll take a picture with you.

255
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:45.500
I go to the bathroom.
This is a true story.
Hannah,
her bible hand on the Bible.

256
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.730
I assume the guy is outside the bathroom cause I,
as I'm going,

257
00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:54.190
I seen him and I say what?
I say,
I get done.
I go to the sink,

258
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.890
wash my hand.
He was just sitting behind a wall and he's like,

259
00:15:57.891 --> 00:16:00.050
got his phone out and I'm like,
he probably did.

260
00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:04.190
He just take me while I was shitting did put the phone over the thing.

261
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:09.020
Jesus like I'm about to be on.
Oh my God,
it's over.

262
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:11.300
This is it doesn't my nightmare.
Here we go.

263
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.710
They're about to put something up of me.
Shitting is the bottom of my feet.

264
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:20.660
It's whatever.
But he's just waited and in that moment was so,

265
00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:24.940
it was so important that he was in the bathroom and as soon as I got a call and

266
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.530
let's take an asset,
let's go outside the bathroom,

267
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.760
let's take a picture that's a bathroom.
I said,
I'm not going well.
I'm a nice guy,

268
00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:34.550
man.
I'm going to take the picture.
He's,
I just didn't want to lose you.

269
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:39.560
And I'm like,
there's not even a thought.
It's not even a thought about,

270
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:44.060
it's a bath.
Right.
So weird as us and pass the minister.
This is a,

271
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.930
this is a pretty fucking weird moment,
man.
This is weird.

272
00:16:47.931 --> 00:16:51.710
And all when you were waiting for me to finish it and now know what you got on

273
00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:55.010
your phone,
right?
You're too big for me to ask to go through your phone,

274
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.500
whatever you got you got.

275
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.070
But I had to go out and take the picture and I remember going back to the table

276
00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:05.960
just like what's happening?
This has strange at this point,

277
00:17:05.961 --> 00:17:08.780
what is happening.
Yeah.
That didn't exist before.

278
00:17:08.781 --> 00:17:09.980
I think if you were famous before,

279
00:17:09.981 --> 00:17:13.580
people just wanted to get an autograph or shake your hand.
What pat?
We're past.

280
00:17:13.581 --> 00:17:17.080
The autograph stage was all the time you get an autograph.
It's been awhile.

281
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.490
I don't know how to write it.
I would think I would know what to put down.

282
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.240
It's been a minute man.
And I don't,
and I want to make this very clear,
you know,

283
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:31.100
I don't,
I don't know it,
you know,
I understand.
Like once again,

284
00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:34.940
I want people to more importantly understand the fact that I welcome it.

285
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.880
I welcome the moment that I can talk in and converse with the fan.

286
00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.460
But it should be that like,
it's normal to date.

287
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:47.060
The moments are better whenever real,
you know,

288
00:17:47.061 --> 00:17:51.960
and after a real moment you,
you get a picture because you're like,
Yo,

289
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:57.380
he was actually a nice guy or I know I did it that you would be this calm and

290
00:17:57.781 --> 00:17:58.410
cool.

291
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:02.130
You don't even get to see how genuine of a person I am because the first thing

292
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:06.900
you do,
you,
you,
you stick the camera in the face,
you,

293
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:11.000
and that's when people think that you're an asshole because they,
they,
they,

294
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.610
they have the intrusive moment that then gets met with it.
Can you,

295
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.890
can you please,
I'm sorry.
You don't have to just take it in my face.
Damn.

296
00:18:17.891 --> 00:18:22.010
You ain't gotta be like that.
Wait,
look for that.
Yeah.
Turn on you.

297
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.170
Because now you get your moment.
You look for the negative moment.

298
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.830
When does she start getting weird for you?
But how many years in?
Um,

299
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.440
I know it's been,
it's been pretty crazy.

300
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.770
It's been pretty crazy for like the last four to five,

301
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:39.270
the last four to five years and the last three,
you know,

302
00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:41.790
if it's gotten insane because now you know,
you're,

303
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:47.290
you're on an international level so it was global and the following is,

304
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:52.350
is bigger.
Um,
and it's all ages,
which is,
which is really,

305
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:52.851
really good about.

306
00:18:52.851 --> 00:18:57.851
Thank you know for Comedians it's a different thing because you feel like,

307
00:18:58.831 --> 00:19:00.840
you know,
Comedians,
you know,

308
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:04.860
you're laughing where in your homes everything is met with warmth.

309
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:09.390
So when you see a comedian,
and especially if you're a fan of a comedian,

310
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.390
you're associating everything with funny and you're just looking for the funny

311
00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:17.070
moment.
You're looking past the normal moment,

312
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:21.810
you know,
it's like you almost are frowned upon if you're normal,

313
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.530
if you're just chill.
Right,
right,
right.
Cause everybody wants to find a moment.

314
00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:28.830
They thought you were going to be funny all the time.
I'm supposed to,

315
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:33.480
I was supposed to pop lock
right on site.
You know,

316
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.310
if it's two in the morning and you run into me and I say,
hey,
how you doing,
man?

317
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.190
That's not enough.
When you work out your shit.

318
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:45.480
Now I've seen you at the comedy store,
but only once.
Where,

319
00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:49.020
where do you work out your shirt?
I like to go to random comedy clubs.
You know,

320
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:53.670
I think I'll go to New York first.
Uh,
New York has always been a home.

321
00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:57.090
Um,
when it comes to building,
uh,

322
00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:01.080
putting some structure within a set that you're trying to figure out.

323
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.850
Once I got a skeleton of what I want to do,
I'll just go to west palm.

324
00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:09.090
I love that comedy club,
the Improv down there,
and I'll stay,

325
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.740
I'll stay for two weeks.
Oh real.
And just go and run through some jokes.

326
00:20:13.741 --> 00:20:17.640
I'll go to Utah,
I'll go to Denver.

327
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.970
Who Do the wiseguys.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I'll go to comedy clubs.

328
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:23.040
Just random comedy clubs that you wouldn't expect to see me yet.

329
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.990
But I'll do a hell of a run.

330
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.440
And the goal is to get out of there with just a foundation.

331
00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.730
It's not to have a complete set.
I just want to get a foundation.

332
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:37.380
So when I'm done getting a foundation,
then I'll do a little comedy club run.

333
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.330
I do a full comedy club,
Ryan,

334
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.410
where I just put two or three months in and it's coming to club comedy club

335
00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:45.750
comedy club and I'm doing seven shows a weekend.

336
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:50.230
And people were shocked that I'm there and then I'm doing it.
But you know,

337
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.840
that's my,
that's my gym.
That's how I work.

338
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:57.870
And I ended up leaving that period of time with a complete set after the first

339
00:20:58.271 --> 00:21:01.390
three or four months that I spent,
now I have to do a comedy club,

340
00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:04.660
three to four months,
don't that run.
Then I'll take it to like a small theater.

341
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:08.050
I see what my laugh to feels like in a small theater and I'll do a little run in

342
00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:08.890
small theaters.

343
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:13.630
And then when I finally feel like it's at a point where I'm getting the,

344
00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:18.220
the laugh consistently and the punchlines are working and I flipped it back

345
00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:20.080
frontwards,
forward every direction.

346
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:25.030
And my story is a real rollercoaster and it has an ending where I feel like we

347
00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:28.420
get off the rollercoaster and we're happy and you don't feel like you were there

348
00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:33.130
for an hour because then when I go test it out in El arena and if the arena,

349
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.670
if the last or sounds the way it's supposed to,
then I'll say,
okay,
I'm ready.

350
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.533
If it doesn't,

351
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:41.200
then I'll go back to small theaters and then I'll go to an arena again.

352
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.910
So not too bad of Rina sounds way it's supposed to do.
I say I'm going on tour,

353
00:21:45.911 --> 00:21:50.380
so sometimes it takes me about a year,
a year and three months here,
four months.

354
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:50.990
You know,

355
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.610
people don't understand how hard it is to develop an hour of standup material.

356
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.480
You know,
people act like you just turn on a new hour.
It's,

357
00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.280
it's an hour to get to an hour.

358
00:22:00.281 --> 00:22:04.510
You're going through four to five hours of bullshit that you thought was funny.

359
00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:08.200
Yeah.
To come up to that hour that you finally say,

360
00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.040
this is going to be the representation of me this year.
Yeah.

361
00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.380
It's a lot for me to do that.
Especially at this level,
you know?

362
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.650
Well especially while you're always doing movies and you're always busy with a

363
00:22:17.651 --> 00:22:19.700
bunch of other stuff too.
Stuff that you don't have.

364
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:24.880
I mean you don't take any breaks.
Why tour?
I actually,
you know,
when I'm touring,

365
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.790
if there's a movie,
I made the movie schedule around the tour,

366
00:22:28.791 --> 00:22:33.640
so my shooting days,
we'll go Monday,
Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday wrapped Thursday,

367
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.470
maybe have a show Thursday night and then I'm going Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday,

368
00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.030
sometimes no show Sunday,

369
00:22:40.031 --> 00:22:43.870
sometimes show Sunday depending on what the work schedule and the workload for

370
00:22:43.871 --> 00:22:46.390
the following week would look like.
So I'm implementing that in,

371
00:22:46.391 --> 00:22:50.200
so when I say I'm out,
I'm out,
I'm gone.

372
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:54.430
So I knocked that movie out in two months and then when I'm not that tour

373
00:22:54.431 --> 00:22:58.930
schedule shifts.
So the Monday,
Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday,
dedicated to family,

374
00:22:58.931 --> 00:23:01.810
dedicated to the office,
everything.
Then those weekends a tour,

375
00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.840
but the tour lasts for a year and a half.

376
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:09.460
I mean this year we did 157 shows on my air responsible to her wow.

377
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.000
Hundred and 57 show before you decided to put it on the Netflix special?
Yeah,

378
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:18.040
we did the Netflix,
the taping.
I think I did it three weeks before we were done,

379
00:23:18.041 --> 00:23:21.490
so we were probably at 143 shows.
Oh Wow.

380
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.200
Then I taped it and finished the tour.

381
00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.080
Did you always have this kind of structure?
Like when did you,

382
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:29.820
how did you design this thought out individually?
You seem like I'm a,

383
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:34.270
I'm a well thought out individual.
Everything is,
it's not random.
No.

384
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.360
Everything is planned.
If you look at all my standup specials,

385
00:23:37.361 --> 00:23:38.920
there's a two year gap in between them.

386
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:43.330
So the two year gap is because at the end of that second year,

387
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:47.450
my new special should be coming out when a new special should be coming out.

388
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.870
I'm now focusing on what the next special is going to be.

389
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:56.120
So that first year is all development.
Like right now I'm off,

390
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.140
I'm not touring,

391
00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:02.470
but now I'm mentally in the gym and throwing all the old stuff that I talked

392
00:24:02.901 --> 00:24:06.590
about a way that's now thrown out.
Can't repeat it,
can't say it.

393
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.700
Now it's talking about what the new version of myself is going to be.

394
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.950
What do I want the conversation to be?
What's my thanking and just taking notes.

395
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:20.450
So eventually now I'm going to start just popping up a random comedy clubs and

396
00:24:20.451 --> 00:24:24.230
trying to figure out what the next thing is.
So by mid,

397
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:28.790
mid 20 I'd probably be doing comedy clubs.
By the end of 20,

398
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:34.210
I should have a full fledge concept that that new hour and by the beginning of

399
00:24:34.611 --> 00:24:37.430
21 I should be ready to go out with my new hour.

400
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.810
End of 21 film.

401
00:24:39.811 --> 00:24:43.160
I knew our mid 20 to the hour would come out.

402
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:46.890
That seems like a schedule a lot of people are doing now.
The two years schedule.

403
00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:51.770
It's a perfect get.
That's how I do.
I,
I know Louis C K did a year every year.

404
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:53.060
George Carlin did every year,

405
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.630
but I think even he said that really wasn't the right way.
That's tough.

406
00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:01.310
A year's tough.
Yeah.
I mean that's a,
that's a shouts out to those that can do it.

407
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.390
I think that's amazing.
Um,

408
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.240
I think just for everything that I have going on and all of the different things

409
00:25:08.241 --> 00:25:10.790
that my hands are in within the brand,
the business,

410
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.980
I need to make sure that I'm giving a 100% to those things so they have the

411
00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:20.540
highest opportunity to be successful.
If I'm trying to cheat it,

412
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:26.110
then it's going to show it's not going to come out to the best of my ability and

413
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.990
will then stand up.
You gotta you gotta fucking magnifying glass on you,
you know,

414
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.250
you're always being judged off of what you did at one point.

415
00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:35.780
Just like a musician,

416
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:40.810
you're always judged off of the album that everybody thought was whatever.

417
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.230
So the biggest thing for an entertainer,
artists,
whatever your craft is,

418
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:49.610
his creation,
how you recreating yourself,

419
00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:52.790
how you constantly showing that you're growing.
For me,

420
00:25:52.791 --> 00:25:57.590
the only way to do that is to talk about my life and the things that grow along

421
00:25:57.591 --> 00:26:01.040
with me.
The only thing that grows in long with me,

422
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:06.530
my experiences,
my family,
my marriage,
my mistakes,

423
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.020
my ups,
my downs.

424
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:14.300
Those are the things that I can talk about forever.
Because as you get older,

425
00:26:14.301 --> 00:26:16.130
things change.
Shit gets different.

426
00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.820
But it's all coming from my personal opinion of me,

427
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.790
my view on me and how I see life.

428
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.120
You can't lose material in this state.

429
00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:31.610
That's why I stay away from certain things because those things can become

430
00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:36.440
boring after awhile for me because I don't have the knowledge of everything that

431
00:26:36.441 --> 00:26:39.860
I should like what,
what kind of thought?
Well,
politics,
I don't joke.

432
00:26:39.861 --> 00:26:42.620
And the politics,
I don't,
I don't joke.

433
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:47.870
And anything that has to do with the slander of others or other communities,

434
00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:51.870
I don't do anything divisive.
Good for you.
That's my,
that's my biggest thing.

435
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.010
And you know,
uh,
this past year was,

436
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.920
was one that got a little weird because I was like,
Yo,

437
00:26:58.921 --> 00:27:03.780
I've really dedicated myself to bringing people together.
Like,

438
00:27:03.781 --> 00:27:08.040
um,
I know that was my,
my goal.
That's my priority.

439
00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:12.960
I damn sure.
Dot.
That's what I was doing on a global scale.
Everybody,
all races,

440
00:27:12.961 --> 00:27:16.650
shapes,
sizes,
whoever you are,
whatever you are,
you can come to a Kevin Hart.

441
00:27:16.651 --> 00:27:17.484
She don't have a good time.

442
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:22.140
So when it came off as if I was a person that was divisive,

443
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:25.500
that was tough.
You're talking about the Oscars,
the Oscars,
Shit.
Yeah.

444
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.350
<v 3>Time where people were just looking to be upset about things.
100 [inaudible].</v>

445
00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.760
They're not looking to looking at you.
Kevin Hart has just a human being like,

446
00:27:32.761 --> 00:27:36.300
what?
What?
Who is he overall super positive.

447
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.400
They're not even concentrating on that.
I mean,

448
00:27:38.401 --> 00:27:42.330
think about how positive you are and yet they tried to concentrate on some jokes

449
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.430
that you did what,
nine years ago?

450
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.350
<v 2>It was a,
it's a,
it's a wake up call of understanding the towns,</v>

451
00:27:49.351 --> 00:27:53.820
but then more importantly,
you know,
for me it was okay,
I went through it.

452
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:59.420
I made sure that the people of the Lgbtq community really understand it.

453
00:27:59.431 --> 00:28:02.730
Hey guys,
I apologize before,
but I'm apologizing again.

454
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:06.120
I'm sorry I'm not that guy.
I don't want you to think I'm that guy.

455
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.340
Then it just became the constant conversation.
They never happy that it,

456
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:16.390
it just became the constant conversation and now it is because I'm not only,

457
00:28:17.221 --> 00:28:18.054
sorry,

458
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:22.710
I don't condone anything that has to do with hate to anybody.

459
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.550
This is no longer a conversation.
So guys,

460
00:28:26.551 --> 00:28:31.551
I'm going to stop talking about it because now I feel like I'm feeding into what

461
00:28:32.251 --> 00:28:33.310
I'm not.
I,

462
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:38.700
I know I'm not the world in public should understand and know to them not

463
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:43.200
because over this time period I've shown that I'm not.

464
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:47.700
So the apology,
once again,
I'm sorry,

465
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.260
genuinely,
I'm sorry,
but then it just kept,
it just,

466
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:57.420
it never stopped.
And at that point I just made a decision and I'm like,
guys,

467
00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.870
at this point,
I just am making a decision to not talk about it anymore.

468
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.330
That doesn't mean that I'm being disrespectful to anybody.
That doesn't mean,

469
00:29:04.331 --> 00:29:08.370
and I'm shutting down anything.
It means that for me,

470
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.280
I'm going to stop talking about it because at this point,

471
00:29:11.281 --> 00:29:15.390
I don't know what to do.
At this point.
I thought,

472
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:19.460
I thought the apology is what you wanted me to do.
I did it.
Uh,

473
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:22.860
may sure did you understand that I'm not a hateful person at Nocca.
Don't hate,

474
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:26.730
I did that as stepped down.
So I don't take attention off of that night.

475
00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:29.280
And those people that are there to be celebrated.

476
00:29:29.281 --> 00:29:33.270
I don't want to draw attention to myself and what's around me.
I stepped down.

477
00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:38.330
Everything I did was for the better of good [inaudible] stubbing away guys,

478
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:43.060
because I don't want this to be a negative night or a negative thing,

479
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:47.710
and then it still became a conversation.
So I waited for it to die down.

480
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.250
I went on my radio show,
gave another public apology,

481
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:56.380
may shouldn't he understand it?
I'm sorry.
I hope these words didn't hurt anybody.

482
00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.730
I once again apologize.
I don't cook.
Don't hate to anyone.

483
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.090
I hope that you guys can forgive me for those jokes of all.

484
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.340
So now I say if you don't understand and that you don't believe it,

485
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:13.180
I don't know what else to give.
I don't know what else to do.

486
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:16.210
It does nothing else you can do that's very wise of you.
Nothing.

487
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:19.270
It's very wisely to step away,
locked up because if you didn't,

488
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.780
they would probably pursue it forever.
I mean,

489
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.630
does it becomes a point of attention.
That's all it is.

490
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.890
They just decide that this is something that they're going to focus on.

491
00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.920
What I had,
uh,
I had a good talk,
and I'm not talking about this a minute.

492
00:30:29.921 --> 00:30:34.900
A friend of mine,
Lee Daniels,
you know,
manly Daniels,
uh,
Lee called me,

493
00:30:34.901 --> 00:30:38.170
told me what to talk to him.
You know,
Lee Daniels is director,

494
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:43.120
a producer,
the show empires of his biggest shows.
Um,

495
00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:47.410
you know,
so he calls me,
he's like,
Kevin won't talk to you.
And,
and us talking,

496
00:30:47.411 --> 00:30:48.850
he's like,
look,

497
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:54.330
this is a time where you could speak up and talk about,

498
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.800
you know,

499
00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:01.800
the community that's been affected by hatred and you know,

500
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.390
hateful crimes.

501
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:09.630
You can step up and be a voice and say that you don't condone or don't,

502
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:15.610
uh,
stand with any type of hate or whatever.

503
00:31:15.611 --> 00:31:19.860
You can take that stage and do that.
And I said,
Lee,
I said,
that's,

504
00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.730
I understand what you're saying.
I said,
well,

505
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:27.090
why didn't you expect me to know what's been happening with in this community in

506
00:31:30.341 --> 00:31:34.960
regards to hate and crimes?
I said,
I,
I'm not aware.
I said,

507
00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.920
some people can just not be aware.
I'm not in the know.

508
00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.660
I have no idea what's going on.
I have no idea.

509
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:49.180
Yes.
Within net community.
I have no idea.
When you tell me this,

510
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.730
I'm now educated and I understand,

511
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.790
so it's easy to simply inform.
Right?

512
00:31:56.350 --> 00:32:00.850
Information is key.
When people get information,
they processed the information.

513
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:05.830
When you can process the information,
you go,
oh,
wait a minute.
That makes sense.

514
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:09.850
Hey,
if you guys think that I can,
don't hate,
wait a minute,

515
00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:14.530
I don't in anybody that does,
fuck you,
man,
that's bad.
You shouldn't.

516
00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.910
I can say that,
but instead when this happened,

517
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:23.470
it was become an ally,
become a voice,

518
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.790
you know,
and that's,
that's where there was just a miscommunication.

519
00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:33.040
That's where a back and forth Kinda was establish that.

520
00:32:33.041 --> 00:32:37.630
I think people just started to take things and run with it and I'm just not,

521
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:42.810
I'm just not one to feed into what I feel isn't going to eventually evolve into

522
00:32:47.721 --> 00:32:52.370
a positive thing in a real conversation.
Yes.
When I'm,
when I'm trying my best to,

523
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:56.540
it was becoming tablet bullshit.
Pretty much talk a real discussion,
clickbait,

524
00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:58.760
clickbait.
If that's the problem.

525
00:32:58.761 --> 00:33:01.550
There's so much clickbait out there because it's such an effective way to get

526
00:33:01.551 --> 00:33:03.530
people to pay attention at things.
Cause as you said,

527
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.860
people focus on failure and negative and anger.

528
00:33:06.861 --> 00:33:08.780
That's where we want to say controversy as well.

529
00:33:08.781 --> 00:33:13.700
We want to see what to see the anger and,
and you know,

530
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:18.080
why do you think that is?
Because he's just the times.
It's,
it's,

531
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:22.340
that's what's cool.
Now is that what it is?
[inaudible] call is being negative.

532
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.550
You know how you always have some people is a great example.

533
00:33:25.551 --> 00:33:29.870
How you have people who mean you can talk about a movie.
All right,

534
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:34.850
we can talk about titanic.
Wow.
And Titanic.
One of the biggest movies of all time.

535
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:39.150
Fucking great movie.
He'll yes,
it was great movie.
And why guy for no reason go.

536
00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:44.030
I fucking hated it.
Why?
Yeah,
like titanic.

537
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:48.080
Fucking bullshit.
Why Manga the Noah?

538
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:53.300
Now tell me why.
Why did you hate it?
I ain't got time told you about that.

539
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.450
The cool thing is just being different.

540
00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.130
I wanna I wanna be completely opposite.
Denali's and treasury has the people,

541
00:34:01.131 --> 00:34:03.800
you know what?
Nah,
Nah,
Nah.
That shit was ass.

542
00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:07.250
Wow.
Wow.

543
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:12.670
Why was it as you had people that just like to do that?
Oh yeah,
for sure.
And and,

544
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:17.510
and what happens when one person does it?
Another person for no reason.
I'll go.

545
00:34:17.511 --> 00:34:22.100
Yeah,
me too.
Yeah,
she was ass man.
Hey,
I ain't like it either.

546
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.380
Did you see it?
Which I was talking about.

547
00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:26.870
You don't have to know what they're talking about,

548
00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:31.940
but she just want to harp on the negative tray because that's what's cool.

549
00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:36.560
It's not cool to be positive.
Isn't that cool?
To be happy?

550
00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:37.850
I don't know if it's a cool thing.

551
00:34:37.851 --> 00:34:40.190
I think it's usually people that are really frustrated with their lives.

552
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:44.750
100% what's the,
that's the factual side to it.
I did a joke before.
It was like,

553
00:34:44.751 --> 00:34:48.540
do you think Michael Jordan leaves Youtube comments like,
I bet he does now.

554
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.230
That's awful winters.
No,
not at all.

555
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.530
People that want to get mad and complain constantly about shit like that.

556
00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.350
Do you know what it takes to do this right here?

557
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:07.580
Right here?
I would tell you how I feel riding your comments section.
Joe Rogan,

558
00:35:07.581 --> 00:35:09.490
you king,
Kiss My,

559
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:14.680
you know what that takes you or do you have going on that you have the time to

560
00:35:15.111 --> 00:35:20.111
just simply be that negative and and do it in this world and uniforms.

561
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:22.730
Just a mismanagement of your time.

562
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:28.310
Time is so valuable and I don't think people understand how valuable they can be

563
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:34.310
if they use their time correctly.
Yeah.
Now,
have you always been like this?

564
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.080
You always been this outages fucking guy,
man,

565
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.390
but Hawaii's always really,

566
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:43.290
I find a light in every dark tunnel.

567
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:48.270
I will find a goddamn lightning.
I hear it all.

568
00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:51.720
You'd listen when I tell you to wait on my back is so heavy of all the stuff

569
00:35:51.721 --> 00:35:53.610
that I deal with and I'm fine.

570
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.900
The reason why I'm fine is because I'm genuinely happy.

571
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:03.120
I'm happy and I'm not happy.
Just because of the success.

572
00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:05.460
The success acts as a bonus.

573
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
I'm happy because I truly know the definition and the feeling that comes with

574
00:36:11.641 --> 00:36:14.850
happiness.
I truly know it.
I've felt it.

575
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:16.890
I felt it when I said,
Yo,

576
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:20.460
what really makes me happy and I'm looking at heaven and Hendrickson.

577
00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:23.160
I look as though I look at my wife,
I go,
Yo,

578
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.960
I didn't have the family shit when I was coming up.
Y'All got one.

579
00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.490
I got one.
Look,
what I done did,
look what I built.

580
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:37.080
These people depend on me.
I provide for these people.
That makes me happy.

581
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:42.390
That makes me happy.
When my daughter comes up,
dad,
you're not only my dad,

582
00:36:42.391 --> 00:36:46.560
you're my best friend.
Yo,
I'm happy.
That's my world.

583
00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:51.180
So everything else from the outside that comes in,
you're,
you're,

584
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:55.920
you're throwing shit at a,
at a,
at a bubble that can't be popped.

585
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.750
There's a force field around me.

586
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:00.720
There's a force field around me because what matters,

587
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:04.590
what really matters loves me wholeheartedly.

588
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:09.710
And when you had that and you understand that you're unbreakable,

589
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.260
so if you don't add to that force field,

590
00:37:13.261 --> 00:37:16.680
if you don't make my force field stronger,
you don't,
you don't,

591
00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:22.170
you don't get time for me.
My team hartbeat productions,

592
00:37:22.171 --> 00:37:25.230
the people underneath my umbrella.
You're part of my force field.

593
00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:29.400
You believe what I believe.
We all see the same things.

594
00:37:29.401 --> 00:37:31.740
We want the same things.

595
00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:37.020
So we march with the same beat.
You can't,

596
00:37:37.021 --> 00:37:39.470
you can't shake that.
We,

597
00:37:39.471 --> 00:37:44.471
you're an individual that seen it and understands that if you've never felt that

598
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:48.660
we had no idea what that feels like,
then it's easy to shake you.

599
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.590
That's why some people are easily broken.

600
00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:57.630
Being broken is not a hard thing.
It's not a hard thing.

601
00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:01.320
So those that do get broken,
those that do get down,
those that do get depressed.

602
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:05.370
I understand,
I understand.
I don't,

603
00:38:05.371 --> 00:38:09.150
I don't knock people for it.
I don't knock anybody for it.

604
00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:14.300
What I also understand is that the encouragement that can come from so many can

605
00:38:14.911 --> 00:38:18.720
add value for those that may need a little push,

606
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.360
that may need a little a Mepi Kitchener.

607
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:27.230
It's so easy to be that positive reinforcement for somebody and add value.

608
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:32.760
It's so easy,
but some people choose to throw that aside and kick.

609
00:38:32.761 --> 00:38:37.761
Why your dad I to put out the light of positivity because whoever's out there

610
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:41.260
you,
I don't know what it could do for somebody else,

611
00:38:41.261 --> 00:38:43.360
but somebody else may just simply look at it and say,
Yoda waiting.

612
00:38:43.361 --> 00:38:46.030
He embraces his kids,
makes me want to be a better father.

613
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:50.410
You're where did this man doesn't stop in a way that every day he wakes up and

614
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:51.160
he's just positive.

615
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.430
Regardless of what's going on makes me realize that this shit ain't so bad.

616
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:59.350
The way that he gets up and says,
Hey,
today's another day.
It's a morning.

617
00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.150
Let's all be better than we were yesterday.

618
00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:02.890
Somebody probably needed to hear that.

619
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.820
The more that I can give that out and I can take my platform to throw good

620
00:39:06.821 --> 00:39:07.654
energy out,

621
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:12.750
I'm doing my part because there's so many that throw out the complete opposite.

622
00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:18.550
Yeah.
I don't want to be a part of that.
That's beautiful and that's true.

623
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:22.390
I believe you.
It's not,
it's not forced.
It's not phony.

624
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.200
It's not fake.
I guess.
Shit,

625
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:29.540
every day I hear shit every day.
It's very contagious too.

626
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:32.930
I had a lady,
I heard a lady right now,

627
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:40.420
lady rolled down the window.
She goes,

628
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:42.190
where are you going to make a good movie again?

629
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:52.210
I said,
did you see the upside?
I thought the upside was good.
What's that?

630
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:57.220
Oh Shit.
It's a movie.
It's one of my movies that's out us think.

631
00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:00.310
I think it's a good movie.
I didn't see that.

632
00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.050
Alright ma'am,
you have a beautiful day.

633
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:10.010
That's it.

634
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.630
With such conviction,
like literally I could have said a lot of shit.

635
00:40:19.631 --> 00:40:22.360
Like she rolled her window down.
You could tell she still had the crank,

636
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:27.480
so I'm like,
I got to set a lot of shit.
I
goes,

637
00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.190
a lot of things that I can say to you,
ma'am.

638
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:33.420
Where are you going to make a good movie?
It's snapping

639
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:39.430
that one out the upside and you see the upside.
What's that?
Oh,

640
00:40:39.431 --> 00:40:43.960
it's a movie so it's out now.
Amazing it.
That's how she chose to come out here.

641
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:48.780
I see it.
I get it.
She chooses to come at you with a negative.
I get it every day.

642
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.360
We're going to be funny again.
Try My best,

643
00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:57.640
try my best.
If it's not working for you,
hopefully I do better soon.

644
00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:02.850
What do you,
what do you what?
What am I going to feed into that and it why?

645
00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:06.280
Why?
Why?
Why?
For what?

646
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:11.380
For what?
It seems to have been working thus far.

647
00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:16.120
Are you getting this positive attitude towards life from life experience?

648
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.920
Are you getting it from books?
Did someone teach you how to find this?

649
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:24.990
I'm getting it from the experiences and from the,

650
00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:30.960
the real understanding of perfection doesn't exist.

651
00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.030
Don't exist.
Joe Know,
well,

652
00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:39.470
we're in a time right now where people expect perfection.

653
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:42.890
You expect perfection and I don't know where this came from.

654
00:41:42.891 --> 00:41:46.940
I don't know what happened that this is the criteria for living.

655
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:52.850
My true understanding is,
all right,
you got one life and at one life,

656
00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:59.020
the goal for us is to live it to the best of our ability from the beginning to

657
00:42:00.681 --> 00:42:05.000
what said the n in the middle and the beginning.
Middle,

658
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.180
you're going to do things.
You're going to make mistakes.
You're going to fuck up.

659
00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:13.780
You're supposed to learn and then move forward with the understanding of what

660
00:42:13.911 --> 00:42:18.620
not to do and when you move forward,
life may get better.
It may not,

661
00:42:18.621 --> 00:42:22.490
but somewhere along the lines is going to click and everything that I went

662
00:42:22.491 --> 00:42:26.960
through back here was supposed to happen so that now that I'm here,

663
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:32.710
I'm able to go ahead with such a high level of knowledge and I can make other

664
00:42:34.611 --> 00:42:38.660
people better.
I can make myself better.
I could do more from a family.

665
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.050
Something happens.
My Dad is the prime example.

666
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:47.150
Crazy drug addict and not a jail.
Life was very bad,

667
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:50.840
very fucking bad for my dead son,

668
00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:54.290
got successful son,
then took money,

669
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:58.430
gave it to his day.
Here's your house,
here's your truck.

670
00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:03.470
Here's your monthly.
At this age,
I want you to live your life.

671
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:05.210
You'd have made mistakes.

672
00:43:05.211 --> 00:43:09.770
You can't rebuild and correct the things that you've done.
I'm your son.

673
00:43:09.771 --> 00:43:12.830
I love you.
You can't go back in and Redo.

674
00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:17.120
You can't try to keep going backwards and about me.
You got grandkids,

675
00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.740
go be the best grandpop you can be for these grandkids.
That's your focus now.

676
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:25.760
Where's this energy devoted to being a grandpop for the grandkids?

677
00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.120
Don't worry about me,
but something happened in your life.

678
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:34.870
Something happened that took you in the direction to reap the benefits of your

679
00:43:35.391 --> 00:43:36.890
son's happiness and success.

680
00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:39.920
My energy is now contagious enough and I hand it to you,

681
00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:44.060
so now you're able to give that off to all these other people that you're
around.

682
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:49.960
Something happens and that's an every single life in every life I under stand

683
00:43:51.621 --> 00:43:56.270
that there's a payoff for Baird eventually cause payoff.

684
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:58.520
It can't be bad,
but for so long,

685
00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:03.620
if you got the strength and the understanding to realize that shit will change,

686
00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.970
it will change.
It's impossible.
Just like poker.

687
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:11.210
I don't know if you play poker nut,
I don't.
You play poker.

688
00:44:11.211 --> 00:44:15.170
You can run bad forever,
but it will eventually turn around.

689
00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.510
Once you grasp the understanding of the game,

690
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:22.490
eventually it's want to turn around blackjack.
You Never gonna beat the casino,

691
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:25.880
but eventually you're going to have a good run.
If you catch a run,

692
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.070
you'll do good.
Get the fuck out of there.

693
00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:33.000
You waited long enough with the happened hair,
come catch it.
Leave.

694
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:37.200
Anything in life will eventually tie.
Good.

695
00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.330
<v 3>No,
but this is coming just from your own personal experiences.</v>

696
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:43.880
How many role models that my mother do this way.
Nancy Hart.

697
00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.990
Did she speak to you like this?
About positivity and about

698
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:52.750
<v 2>my mom reinforced knowledge.</v>

699
00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:59.030
My mom reinforced you don't start things and not finish them.
You don't quit.

700
00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:04.250
There is nothing that comes out of quitting besides knowing that you didn't

701
00:45:04.251 --> 00:45:07.940
finish.
We finish everything.
You start it,
finish it.

702
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.240
If you're going to do it,
do it to try and be the best,

703
00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.450
not be better than other people.
Be the best for you.

704
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:17.900
If you're in school and you're going to class,

705
00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.300
I'm not asking you to get straight A's.

706
00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:24.200
I'm asking you to get the best grade that you can possibly get.

707
00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:30.040
Give me a 100% all the time and I'm a happy mother when you half as me,

708
00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:35.510
I'm on.
Yes
Mam.
I want to do this.
I want to.

709
00:45:35.511 --> 00:45:39.770
I want to play baseball.
Well then you go and play Mama like that.

710
00:45:39.771 --> 00:45:43.310
No more than why did you start the season?
Cause I thought I wanted to do it.

711
00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:45.320
Then you gonna finish the season.
You don't quit.

712
00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:47.510
There's other people that invest time and energy into you.

713
00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:51.410
You don't just quit on people,
but I don't want to do it.
Finish the season.

714
00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:55.970
Mama want to swim,
then you going to finish women.
It didn't matter what I did,

715
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:59.900
I was never allowed to quit.
So now in anything I do,

716
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:04.250
when I pick it up and say I'm gonna Start it,
I've got to finish it at all.

717
00:46:04.251 --> 00:46:08.130
Don't work.
It all linked the best.
Hmm?

718
00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:13.790
It all ain't knocked out the park.
But I walk away saying,
I finished it.
I did it.

719
00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:19.640
I did it right now.
Been Boxing.
I saw us.
How you working out with Rico?

720
00:46:19.641 --> 00:46:23.150
Verhoeven fucking um,
first of all,
very strong kicker.

721
00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:29.900
Manage man.
Huge man.
Okay.
He's a fucking beast.
He's a good guy too,

722
00:46:29.901 --> 00:46:34.460
man.
Good guy.
But I started the jeans.
I started it and I said,

723
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.660
why am I doing this?
I'm not gonna be a professional fighter.

724
00:46:38.661 --> 00:46:42.200
I'm not trying to be average a fighter.
I'm done with getting to shape.
All right?

725
00:46:42.201 --> 00:46:44.530
Then I'll start getting shaved and said,
oh,

726
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:46.940
so much that don't know about the sport.

727
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.020
I at least want to make sure that I'm paying homage to the people that do this

728
00:46:51.021 --> 00:46:55.130
for living by really understanding and learning it.
You know what,

729
00:46:55.131 --> 00:46:56.480
I'm gonna get a real trainer.

730
00:46:57.130 --> 00:46:59.780
I'm gonna get some real people to show me everything.

731
00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:04.190
So when it's all said and done and I look back after my training,
I can go,

732
00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:09.110
I gave it 100% and look at how good I got.
Look at what I'm a product though.

733
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.590
I spar.
I go get it.

734
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:16.240
<v 3>Yeah.
Just to feel it did.
So I can say I did it.
You know else bars.</v>

735
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.290
Brian Cowen does this.
You serious

736
00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:21.820
<v 2>me?
That's me.
Come on.
That's me dude.</v>

737
00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:25.450
That's me is getting it to look at this

738
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.200
blue is teaching yet.
Uh,
his name is big.

739
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.900
<v 0>He's in Atlanta.
That's me learning how to turtle shell within punches.
Uh,</v>

740
00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:38.800
but you know,
he's a former golden glove guy.
Really good.

741
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:40.210
So you were in a cup and everything.

742
00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:44.440
What I was at the sparring session when I'm like real tired,
Damn Yada,
got touch.

743
00:47:44.441 --> 00:47:46.630
I think got my ass whipped and every couple of times,
um,

744
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:49.450
I can go over the guy worried about that at all getting up.
Cause I'm not,

745
00:47:49.451 --> 00:47:51.310
I don't go crazy.
We head gear and,

746
00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:55.630
but I'm not in there with guys that are trying to hurt.
Yes.

747
00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:00.250
And that in neo was touching you guys that have no concept of reality or

748
00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:03.220
control.
Like they're,
they're just helping me understand,

749
00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.860
here's why you have to keep your hand.

750
00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:10.520
That is a problem with celebrities trying to spar.
I think if you try to like,

751
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.240
you know,
that's why you work started getting all that facial surgery.

752
00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:16.910
I series James Tony,
she beat them,

753
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:23.830
which is not a smart move right here.
James.
Tony is a mean man.

754
00:48:23.831 --> 00:48:27.700
It's just an eye you can't like I don't,
I don't go in that space.

755
00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.320
And you ever seen James Tony Talk Shit?

756
00:48:29.321 --> 00:48:31.930
Well he spars and there's some of the most entertaining thing you'll ever find

757
00:48:31.931 --> 00:48:35.930
on youtube.
He's just,
he just won't shut the fuck up all the time.

758
00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:39.670
Beating your ass.
Just talking shit.
That's her Fitch got bitch.

759
00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:43.270
Oh this ain't shit.
That's her.
That's him.

760
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:47.440
He's one of the best defensive fighters ever.
So he's really difficult to hit.

761
00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:50.520
He's got that Shell going and standing right in front of you and you can't hit.

762
00:48:50.521 --> 00:48:52.050
It was most frustrating thing in the world.
Yeah.

763
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:55.570
I had a guy that's got any Mikey have barn with Mikey.

764
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:59.650
Mikey hit me with three punches.
I thought,

765
00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:04.780
I thought Mikey literally had like six arms.

766
00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:06.640
This is a true story.
I said,

767
00:49:06.641 --> 00:49:11.050
I don't know what just happened but I thought I had my hands up and no matter

768
00:49:11.051 --> 00:49:13.000
where I put them he just tapped me.

769
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:16.720
He lets me feel it but not to where I'm like getting knocked out.

770
00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.900
But I understand now movement,
I understand pivots,

771
00:49:19.901 --> 00:49:22.840
I understand shoulder protection and that's my goal.

772
00:49:22.841 --> 00:49:26.090
My goal is just to understand cause I can't do anything halfway.
Kev,

773
00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.060
you trying to fight somebody?
Nope.
Nope.

774
00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:31.180
I just want to say to that did it and I learned and I can move and I looked

775
00:49:31.181 --> 00:49:35.260
apart cause I put time into it.
Well as you learn it too,

776
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.210
and as you watch it and you start get trimmed,

777
00:49:37.211 --> 00:49:41.870
then you start to look at a guard like a Terrence Crawford or Aloma Chenko and

778
00:49:41.871 --> 00:49:45.910
he'd go,
oh,
now I appreciate what you're doing.
Because before you'd see like,

779
00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.460
Oh yeah,
he beat that guy up.
Oh yeah,
he knocked the guy out.

780
00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:53.170
But then you see like how he ducks under the left and fires back with the right.

781
00:49:53.171 --> 00:49:56.380
You know what I'm saying?
Oh Jesus.
This is precision.
It's insane.

782
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:58.660
The respect that I have,

783
00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:01.930
people that do that or the day to day is through the roof.

784
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:07.530
[inaudible] people that fight in the most amazing shape and the universe.

785
00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:12.880
Yeah.
You're in the most amazing shape ever to move,

786
00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:17.320
get hit for three to five minutes around,

787
00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:22.240
come back,
do it,
come back to it,
and he's fights.

788
00:50:22.241 --> 00:50:26.620
Go on and on and on.
I take my hat off to you.
You get three rounds out of me.

789
00:50:26.621 --> 00:50:27.620
I'm breathing.
I'm a,
but

790
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:30.890
<v 3>I don't know where the air is coming from.
I'm searching for it.</v>

791
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:35.180
It's a crazy way to make a living too much in your brain.

792
00:50:35.181 --> 00:50:39.050
Like thank God I don't,
ah,
I didn't have to go down that route.
And you know,

793
00:50:39.051 --> 00:50:43.010
to those that do,
just make sure you just put your body first.
Like you said,

794
00:50:43.011 --> 00:50:46.760
it's a,
it's hurtful when you see the damage that it can cause.
Yeah.

795
00:50:46.761 --> 00:50:47.900
We were talking about that earlier,

796
00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:51.860
like seeing guys as they start to deteriorate and it's hard because nobody wants

797
00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:52.700
to tell him that either.

798
00:50:52.701 --> 00:50:56.660
Everybody wants to tell him they got one more good fight and I'm,
and let's,
uh,

799
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.760
maybe at the end of the year then we'll decide.

800
00:50:58.761 --> 00:51:02.270
But right now we're going to train hard and stuff.
It's hard to,

801
00:51:02.271 --> 00:51:03.620
because there's no option c.
Dot.

802
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:07.220
Once you've established yourself as a professional fighter and you don't have an

803
00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.790
exit strategy,
you don't want to do,
you know,
now at least,

804
00:51:10.791 --> 00:51:14.680
thankfully because of the Internet guys are getting podcasts and they started

805
00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:18.830
doing commentary shows that talking about fighting and just the positive.
Yeah.

806
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.840
Would you just sit there and just found the positive,

807
00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:26.300
the positive within the end and yet there is positive.
Oh for sure.
Just don't,

808
00:51:26.301 --> 00:51:28.730
you just don't hear it.
Celebrate it as much.
Well,
the dinner,

809
00:51:28.731 --> 00:51:32.390
it was very positive for me.
I mean this is this show we do on the Internet.

810
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:34.180
I mean all that.

811
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:38.240
Not just podcasts but youtube videos and also information.

812
00:51:38.241 --> 00:51:41.210
I know more because of the Internet than I ever would have without it.

813
00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.900
There's not a,
not a doubt in my mind,
a more educated,

814
00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:48.610
more aware person,
I want to say the Internet.
Yeah.

815
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:52.460
You get the things that you're able to find and search and I mean like you said,

816
00:51:52.461 --> 00:51:56.600
you're,
you're able to self educate at a,
at a very high level.

817
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:58.940
These are the goods.
Yeah.
But talking about the goods.

818
00:51:58.941 --> 00:52:02.480
So when you talk about positive Kevin,
how are You Ben?
Yeah,
I always liked that.

819
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:05.540
It's,
this is the things that I look at that is so easy.

820
00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:08.180
You're not just positive though.
You're like crazy ambitious.

821
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:11.180
That's the thing that gets me about you and the rock for sure.

822
00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.840
It's like the ambitions off the charts.
Like I know your richest fuck.
Like when,

823
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:16.970
when do you think you got enough?
You don't have enough.

824
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.690
There's no doesn't know enough.
I don't have enough because it's not over.

825
00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.130
It's not over.
It's not over.

826
00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:27.260
<v 2>You know when when you put a cap on it yet you're putting a punctuation to it</v>

827
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:29.960
and the the,

828
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:35.770
the ambition comes from seeing what's out there that can be obtained.

829
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:41.060
You know,
when you see what's out there.

830
00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.430
Like what can you mean physical things like what do you see?

831
00:52:43.431 --> 00:52:48.431
What's out there when you see where people are really gaining wealth in

832
00:52:50.421 --> 00:52:52.280
knowledge from,
okay.

833
00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:55.760
The business relationships that you're able to acquire,

834
00:52:56.090 --> 00:53:01.090
the people that you're able to partner with a creates certain things,

835
00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.520
different revenue streams.

836
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:09.410
What I found is as a young black guy from North Philadelphia,

837
00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:15.040
the biggest problem with the biggest problem with Finn,

838
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:19.610
our community is knowledge.
We don't know debt.

839
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:23.750
Debt is welcomed because it's celebrated.
That's all we know.

840
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.220
Hey Nah,
good that credit card on them.

841
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.730
Fuck that credit card up and it is what it is.
They've got to figure that out.

842
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:33.180
I ain't got it after that.
Yeah.
Well you know what?
I'm getting student loans.

843
00:53:33.181 --> 00:53:35.250
They gave it to me.
Then after that shit,
it is what it is.

844
00:53:35.251 --> 00:53:39.690
I'm figuring out and I put the capability,
your name,
you put it in my name,

845
00:53:39.691 --> 00:53:41.230
we could switch it up.
Whatever they do it,

846
00:53:41.231 --> 00:53:45.720
then let's just put it in somebody else name.
It's welcome.
The hustle is welcome.

847
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:51.120
The knowledge of banks and what you can do or can't do is it's fucking,

848
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:54.030
you don't even get it cause you go to check cashing places.

849
00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.830
He's like go check cash places cause I don't want to go through that shift.

850
00:53:56.831 --> 00:53:59.640
The banks,
I don't trust that.
Go right there to check has,
please let me get my,

851
00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:02.160
let me get my now take $30 whatever.
Let me get it.

852
00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:05.760
The knowledge isn't given so it's not to,

853
00:54:05.761 --> 00:54:09.270
you obtain that knowledge and understanding that you go,
oh shit.

854
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:14.580
Oh this is why you put money up.
Oh this is,

855
00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.700
this is how you increase vs decrease.

856
00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:21.210
Oh this is how you earn on your money.
Oh Wow.

857
00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:26.130
I can gain wealth by investing in what the stock world is,
what,

858
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:30.840
how many people partake in the stock world and is there a part that isn't

859
00:54:30.841 --> 00:54:34.520
necessarily gambling?
Is there a low risk part?
These,
the snap,

860
00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:36.880
the information is in there,
right?
So it's not too,

861
00:54:36.881 --> 00:54:38.930
I got to a certain level and a certain group,

862
00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.310
people where I got it and now that I got it,

863
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.520
I want to give it so now I'm going to give it,

864
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:48.240
I'm going to give it to the people that I know needed most.

865
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:53.490
And for me that younger generation of black people that don't understand.

866
00:54:53.491 --> 00:54:57.270
The cool thing is in financial longevity,

867
00:54:57.930 --> 00:55:01.080
not in the now,
it's not in the moment for jewelry,

868
00:55:01.081 --> 00:55:05.380
not in the moment for the car it's in.
The longevity is in building.

869
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:07.890
So at the end of the day you can say,
look at what I have,

870
00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:12.630
look at what I worked for,
look at what I have.
That's mine.
Monopoly is real,

871
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.860
but you have to have the financial understanding.
And I teamed up,

872
00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:20.490
I got chased on and we've done some called financial fitness where it's just

873
00:55:20.491 --> 00:55:25.020
about me educating people on money really how to manage money,
how to,

874
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:26.670
how to be smart with your money,

875
00:55:26.671 --> 00:55:28.410
but it's coming from a person that fucked up money.

876
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:30.690
I didn't always understand it.

877
00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:35.220
I owed in taxes before because I didn't understand that in the beginning I've

878
00:55:35.221 --> 00:55:39.990
had bad credit.
Credit cards wouldn't take me because I maxed out whatever.

879
00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:41.040
I've been there,
I've done it,

880
00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:45.390
thank God I was able to fix it and get on the right path and now that I have the

881
00:55:45.391 --> 00:55:48.000
knowledge I want to give it because we simply don't know.

882
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:50.880
So when you say the end game,

883
00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:55.260
the end game is getting to a point where I've taken all the knowledge that I've

884
00:55:55.261 --> 00:56:00.261
been able to get over these years and really applying it and providing family

885
00:56:00.871 --> 00:56:02.940
wealth when it's all said and done.

886
00:56:02.941 --> 00:56:04.830
The last name Hart is going to mean just more,

887
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:09.960
a lot more than just Kevin hearted comedy hartbeat productions.

888
00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:13.410
Hartbeat digital.
You got heartbeat ventures,
your heartbeat real estate.

889
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:17.430
There's so many things that the last name Hart will be attached to you.

890
00:56:17.431 --> 00:56:21.180
So real estate,
Kevin Hart and sell real estate,
buy real estate.

891
00:56:21.181 --> 00:56:24.880
I don't Saturday talk about yourself.
Yes,
I don't sell it,

892
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:29.620
I buy it.
But the reason why is because the investment investment.

893
00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:34.930
But as you get older,
you learn this,
you learn it.
And,
and you know,

894
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:38.740
it's such a thing where you talk about um,
black versus white.
You know,

895
00:56:38.741 --> 00:56:42.950
a lot of people do that and,
and ifly.
So like there,
there is racism.

896
00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:45.520
Racism exists.
I'm not unaware of that.

897
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:48.460
But there is a high volume of it that's,

898
00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:51.100
that's nonexistent to people that have good people.

899
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:56.370
And when you can merge yourself with good people and follow the paths that you

900
00:56:56.951 --> 00:57:00.700
seated,
these good,
successful people have taken,

901
00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:05.220
you didn't become a part of a world and group that nobody expected you to be it.

902
00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:06.401
So for me,

903
00:57:06.401 --> 00:57:09.860
I now have the position to do that and take all of these relationships and all

904
00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:12.280
this knowledge and take it back to the people that need the most.

905
00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.410
I like to share.
I don't want it all by myself.

906
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.170
Now are you doing this and the financial stuff,

907
00:57:17.171 --> 00:57:21.270
you're doing this in videos or you look releasing videos?
No,
we're starting,

908
00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.770
we're going to start off.
We're going to start financial fitness.

909
00:57:23.771 --> 00:57:28.650
Like I said with chase,
JP Morgan Chase,
um,
Jamie diamond,
very good guy,
uh,

910
00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:29.830
to shine de as well.

911
00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:34.330
They're there help leading in charge of just saying how can we get to the people

912
00:57:34.331 --> 00:57:38.230
that we feel neat,
they financial information the most.
So I said,

913
00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:42.880
put me out there like let's,
let's go directly to the consumer.

914
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.260
So from colleges,
uh,
from high schools,

915
00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:49.870
um,
senior classes,
junior classes,

916
00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:52.930
going out and talking to people before they go into the next stages of their

917
00:57:52.931 --> 00:57:53.620
life,

918
00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:57.340
about the things that you should know before you get to speak to them and just

919
00:57:57.341 --> 00:57:58.780
share personal information.

920
00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:01.390
Are you going to put this stuff online as well though?
Yeah.
Yeah.

921
00:58:01.391 --> 00:58:04.510
You'll be able to track and find content from it.
But I'm authentic,

922
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.460
so I said the best way to really do it,

923
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:10.150
there's a put me in a position to be heard.
I want to be heard like,

924
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:14.740
like it's a different story.
What I explained to,
uh,
the,

925
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:18.370
the people of JP Morgan Chase just when we were talking about this and that's an

926
00:58:18.371 --> 00:58:20.770
amazing board of people,
uh,
that,

927
00:58:20.771 --> 00:58:24.610
that are just figuring this out and the best way to go and do it.
And I said,

928
00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.830
you can't have,
uh,

929
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:31.860
the white guy that's never been to the hood or who's not from the hood or has no

930
00:58:33.941 --> 00:58:38.710
idea how the economy works here and what the real troubles are.

931
00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:43.150
You can't throw that man and the situation to talk to people because I'm not

932
00:58:43.151 --> 00:58:45.970
listening to you from the gate because you don't relate.
I don't relate to you.

933
00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:50.440
But there was somebody in a situation,
Ned's lived it,
that's been in it,

934
00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:55.840
that's been fucked up in it,
made it out of it,
and is now coming back to help.

935
00:58:55.930 --> 00:59:00.580
Right?
It's a different ball game.
And that's what I want to be.
And you know,

936
00:59:00.581 --> 00:59:02.800
we have other voices outside of myself.

937
00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:05.440
I'm very powerful voices that are going to do it as well.

938
00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:09.040
But the purpose is to align ourselves to really make a change.

939
00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:12.880
So you can either be the conversation about making change and you can be actual

940
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:14.800
a part of the action to do it.

941
00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.590
I want to be a part of the action and and doing it.

942
00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:22.580
You'll also be able to understand my drive.
You'll get,
I do so much.

943
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:27.380
You'll get why my hand is in so much because I have access to it in.

944
00:59:27.381 --> 00:59:30.680
The question should be why not?
Yeah.
The question shouldn't be,
Yo,

945
00:59:30.681 --> 00:59:32.690
why is he doing everything you should be?
Why aren't you?

946
00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:36.390
Why aren't you trying to do everything?
Why not?
Well,

947
00:59:36.391 --> 00:59:39.110
that's the thing about a girl or que te becomes contagious.

948
00:59:39.111 --> 00:59:41.990
Like what you were saying about surrounding yourself with positive people and

949
00:59:41.991 --> 00:59:45.560
people that are constantly ambitious and that that there's fuel to that.

950
00:59:45.561 --> 00:59:48.320
You feel good about that.
That's what you're doing.
I can,

951
00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:51.980
I can say seeing you here,
right?

952
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:57.170
We walked around.
You show me a facility.
Loved it.
Beautiful facility.

953
00:59:57.890 --> 01:00:02.470
You talk to me about how your podcast has grown to where you are now.

954
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:03.590
The success behind it.

955
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:09.200
I don't leave here and go Jada's dope shit.
I go,
Hey,

956
01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:14.420
I need to do more work on my radio station.
Laugh out loud radio.
I own it.

957
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.790
It's mine.
I got a show on air.
But you know what,

958
01:00:16.791 --> 01:00:20.420
Joe fucking motivated me to do more.

959
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:24.410
I want to make sure that we understand really what's out here within his radio

960
01:00:24.411 --> 01:00:29.411
world because I just saw my guy in his space and I saw happy he is.

961
01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:33.050
What's the success that he has?
I don't want to be you or beat you.

962
01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.610
I want to take this energy and apply it to myself.

963
01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.060
That's the purpose of scene.

964
01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:44.360
That's the purpose of being smart with your eyeballs.
You should be a sponge.

965
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:48.480
So I'm a sponge.
So I come here and I look at how you maneuver.

966
01:00:48.481 --> 01:00:51.770
I look at your set up.
I not only bowed down to congratulate you,

967
01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.100
I leave and I said,
Yo man,
aspired to as dope as hell.

968
01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.010
Jack can't wait the two years you're going to call me.
You got to see my shit.

969
01:00:58.011 --> 01:00:59.510
And you remember I said I was inspired.

970
01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.280
But you're gonna see what I let it grow into.

971
01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:05.600
That's the proper way to get encouraged.

972
01:01:05.601 --> 01:01:09.770
And motivated as opposed to being a hater,
hater,
and and competitive.

973
01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.370
I'm a beat you.
It's not a competition.
I'm not interested in that either.

974
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:16.640
I share the exact same feelings.
It's not a competition at all.

975
01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:20.420
So if you don't have people like that that are inspiring around you,

976
01:01:20.421 --> 01:01:24.590
you might not know how positive it is and how it 100% how powerful it is.

977
01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.800
If you see someone that's on television or on social media and you see them,

978
01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:34.640
it's hard to be inspired.
You don't know them.
But I can say,

979
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:38.210
look at your circle,
right?

980
01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.150
And in your circle,

981
01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.850
if the conversation is all about what we hate,
I can't stand that song.

982
01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:50.330
You see that new fucking car came out.
Okay,
that's shit his ass.

983
01:01:50.331 --> 01:01:52.940
I can't stand that fucking car,
Yo man.

984
01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:58.160
I can't stand in this city a lot of fuck we even in the city,
well we eat.

985
01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:02.510
I hate that place so easy.
If you,
people don't even listen to it.

986
01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.530
It's how easy it can be.
The smallest shit in the world,
the smallest shit.

987
01:02:06.531 --> 01:02:09.560
But if it's always hate,
can't stand his fucking hair falls.

988
01:02:09.561 --> 01:02:14.120
While we got these headphones.
I hate these fucking a hardwood.
Why the buzz here?

989
01:02:14.850 --> 01:02:17.840
Stan is horrible table.
Hey Harwood.
How could you get around with a tape?

990
01:02:17.841 --> 01:02:20.460
I fucking hate this shit.
Fucking cheers.
You ain't got better chairs.

991
01:02:20.461 --> 01:02:25.080
I hate this shit.
Easy,
right?
So easy.
It's so easy to talk about.

992
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:29.610
Yeah.
Yeah.
And so many people don't realize it in a group.
You do it.

993
01:02:29.611 --> 01:02:33.330
You Ping Pong.
Hate off of one another.
Yeah.
Alas.
It's funny.

994
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:37.010
It can be funny.
Funny,
funny.

995
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:42.720
It's just between yourselves.
So Patrice was,
it was one of the best,

996
01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:47.370
one of the best funny haters.
Okay.
You okay?
You,
you bring up a good point.

997
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.530
Comedic hate is a different kind of a different kind of,
hey,
yeah,
comedic hate.

998
01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:59.010
Rest in peace.
One of the,
not one of the,
probably the best Patrice.
Patrice.

999
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:04.020
I remember when I would talk and if I was saying something that you would just

1000
01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:04.863
hear,

1001
01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:12.870
what would you tell him about he's what?
What are you talking about?

1002
01:03:12.871 --> 01:03:16.270
You like just the way you talk bugs,

1003
01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:22.370
what your voice thing about your voice just makes me want to punch you in the

1004
01:03:23.641 --> 01:03:26.230
face.
We talking about here.

1005
01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:32.410
<v 3>What do you would go after you too.
It kinda made you feel good too.</v>

1006
01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:36.040
Like if you're a commerce it,
especially if you're a comic like a,

1007
01:03:36.041 --> 01:03:37.270
I called opie and Anthony wants,

1008
01:03:37.271 --> 01:03:40.670
I was talking to them and Anthony Anthony always has a gun on him.
Yeah.

1009
01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.320
He carries a gun everywhere.
Like he has a concealed carry permit and shit.

1010
01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:45.580
And I said to him,
I said,

1011
01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:50.530
do you ever worry that maybe you're putting out this energy and you're

1012
01:03:50.531 --> 01:03:54.430
manifesting something like some sort of an attack on you?
Yeah.

1013
01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:58.000
Because you're constantly dwelling on it and you always have this gun and

1014
01:03:58.001 --> 01:04:00.280
Patrice goes,
Joe believe in magic,

1015
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:06.060
<v 1>jumbled Levy,
conjuring up the warehouse.
Hey man,
a positive.</v>

1016
01:04:06.061 --> 01:04:09.290
Ready to just start laugh at sea.
He is mad.

1017
01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:16.360
He would go after

1018
01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:18.540
<v 3>you mad.
It was like you just want to step back and watch.</v>

1019
01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:23.680
<v 2>I remember he got bill burst.
So marijuana.
Oh,
Bill used to get so fucking mad.</v>

1020
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:26.380
Beautiful thing about Bill Barbara.
We'd be snapping at bill.

1021
01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:31.040
Bill was got to get my bag.
It's just,
it's not funny if you went up to him,

1022
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:36.250
none of his funny you build like where's the punchline in it?

1023
01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:40.990
There's no punchline.
He,
he is so fucking mad.
We,
the comedy cellar,

1024
01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:45.970
the days that we had their man,
Bill Barber,
Patrice O'Neal,
Keith Robinson,

1025
01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:50.740
Jim Norton,
Collin Quinn,
myself.
Um,

1026
01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.210
when I say we would sit at this table,
Woo,

1027
01:04:55.211 --> 01:05:00.010
said this table for four to five hours and it will be nothing but beautiful

1028
01:05:00.011 --> 01:05:02.500
trash bins to one another.

1029
01:05:02.590 --> 01:05:05.710
When I say they used to give me so much shit,

1030
01:05:05.711 --> 01:05:08.440
that's probably why it's so hard to bother me.

1031
01:05:08.441 --> 01:05:13.441
Now the trashcans that I took from the age 20 to 24 and my young comedic career

1032
01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:19.030
about how awful I was,
I had a joke.

1033
01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:22.510
I had a joke way at the beginning of my career because of the times.

1034
01:05:22.511 --> 01:05:27.460
Let me preface this.
This was way in the beginning of my career.

1035
01:05:27.461 --> 01:05:31.510
This was a joke that I had about,
uh,
about a little people,

1036
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:35.740
midgets at the time.
And it's,
you know,
it was so bad.
It was,

1037
01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:38.110
I got robbed by a cross side,
Mitch.

1038
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:43.500
And the joke was I didn't know he was robbing me cause I was with somebody else.

1039
01:05:44.501 --> 01:05:48.790
So he was looking at my friend,
but he was robbing me.

1040
01:05:48.791 --> 01:05:51.880
It was like a play on being was very,
very awful joke.

1041
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:57.630
I remember telling this joke and a phonebook comes flying on the state,

1042
01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:04.900
put trees through a fucking phone book at me.
I'm talking,

1043
01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:09.490
this is the where the Boston comedy club,
people in the crowd,
tiny little place.

1044
01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:13.750
All you heard was,
and you sit back,

1045
01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:18.640
it hits the floor.
I said,
Yo,
what the fuck was that?
And Patrice said,

1046
01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:22.430
read it is better material in it than what you're saying.

1047
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.890
Crowds does.
Laughing.
He's Ugh.
They all,

1048
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:35.830
they used to trash me so bad.
So bad man.
Uh,

1049
01:06:35.970 --> 01:06:37.510
Geo,
legendary Patrice,
some news story.

1050
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:40.030
I corporate trees jerking off in my house before

1051
01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:46.410
I moved to La.
I'm staying in the two bedroom apartment.
I just got there,

1052
01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:49.720
but she was coming out.
I said,
Yo,
what you need play status.
I got two bedrooms.

1053
01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:54.520
You can come there.
My ex wife at the time,
uh,
you know I come home,

1054
01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:59.080
it's like afternoon,
like Patrice.
I'm like,
Yo,
you home.

1055
01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:04.660
But trace portrays,
I go on the back,

1056
01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.410
open up the door.
I said his big ass computer,

1057
01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.120
all I see is this back hunched over.

1058
01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:20.740
It's like baby oil.
Right?
And I come in,
I'm like,
Yo,
what you doing?
And he's like,

1059
01:07:20.741 --> 01:07:23.800
Yo,
get out.
Get Out,
get out.
You can check it off at my house.

1060
01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:28.720
He's so sick.

1061
01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:32.890
He's so fucking sick that he didn't stop.

1062
01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:41.950
He was so concerned with finishing that he didn't even break stride.

1063
01:07:41.951 --> 01:07:45.270
He didn't turn around and not have me.
Nothing.
You get out,
get out.

1064
01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:49.930
You just saw his back hunch.
He came out like seven minutes later.

1065
01:07:49.931 --> 01:07:51.780
It was like my bad.
I ain't know you was coming home,
dude.

1066
01:07:55.980 --> 01:08:00.550
I fucking Patrice ma'am.
I love him to death.
Love him to death.
Yeah,

1067
01:08:00.551 --> 01:08:02.890
he had the most,
don't give a fuck.

1068
01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:08.170
Hundred most 100% good and bad though.
You know,
there was,

1069
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:12.040
there was a good to it and there was also some bad to,
you know,

1070
01:08:12.041 --> 01:08:16.040
a lot of things that didn't have been for Patrice probably could have happened,

1071
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.200
<v 3>but I think the level of not give a fuck yeah.
Uh,</v>

1072
01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:23.160
prevented some of those days where he was almost too authentic.
Yes.

1073
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:25.370
Like his like did you ever see that?

1074
01:08:25.371 --> 01:08:29.240
What was it Charlie Sheen's rose who's roast was it that he did where he just

1075
01:08:29.241 --> 01:08:34.241
torching everybody else that was on the roast and then he got up there and after

1076
01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:39.440
the fuckers on,
on my level,
why am I here?
Be here.

1077
01:08:39.441 --> 01:08:42.500
What you guys who,
who the fuck is this?
Who is this bitch?

1078
01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:48.590
Oh my God.
Patrice has so many of those things.
Yeah.
So many things.
One of,

1079
01:08:48.730 --> 01:08:52.440
one of the best to do it.
Uh,
if you,
if you are listening,
you're not educated.

1080
01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:53.330
I'm Patrice on now.

1081
01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:57.850
<v 2>I asked did you just watch a Elvin and the room</v>

1082
01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.480
<v 3>bachelors,
some of that,
some of the funniest shit ever.
Man.
And so insightful.</v>

1083
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:07.460
He was so wide,
very smart.
The way people thought and behaved would say shit.

1084
01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:10.680
Like one of the things that he's said that I,
I tell people all the time,
it's a,

1085
01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:15.680
it's a brilliant thing that he said it was,
um,
I forget what controversy it was,

1086
01:09:15.681 --> 01:09:17.990
but he was on television with some woman.

1087
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.750
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1088
01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:22.580
<v 3>Was saying that you should never tell jokes about certain things,
you know,
and,</v>

1089
01:09:22.581 --> 01:09:24.220
and they were,
they were getting mad at someone,

1090
01:09:24.221 --> 01:09:27.220
I think it was opie and Anthony about a joke.
And he said,

1091
01:09:27.221 --> 01:09:30.970
you got to understand that all jokes come from the same place,
the ones you like,

1092
01:09:31.150 --> 01:09:33.670
and the ones you don't like,
the ones they make you laugh.

1093
01:09:33.671 --> 01:09:35.590
And the ones that make you mad,
they all come from the same place.

1094
01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:38.780
Someone's just trying to be funny.
Yeah.
Like sometimes they just don't work.
Work.

1095
01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:43.440
<v 2>I had a talk,
I had a talk with the,
the,</v>

1096
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:46.630
I forgot her name,
I forgot her name,

1097
01:09:46.631 --> 01:09:49.660
but it was when I was doing all the promo for upside and they kept trying to

1098
01:09:49.661 --> 01:09:53.230
break down,
you know,
where,
where,

1099
01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:58.450
where the jokes come from.
You know,
Kevin,
these uh,

1100
01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:03.070
insensitive jokes that you told back then why,
what,
what makes you,

1101
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:07.600
why would you even say those things and the hardest thing for me to explain,

1102
01:10:07.601 --> 01:10:08.434
I was like,

1103
01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:13.650
do you think people think of jokes and while thinking of them think that they're

1104
01:10:15.101 --> 01:10:16.480
not going to be funny?

1105
01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.140
Everything that you think of an a joke form,

1106
01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.530
you're thinking of it because you think you're going to get a laugh behind it.

1107
01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:24.160
Yeah.

1108
01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.750
The gamble is if I get the lab versus not get the lab and you don't get the

1109
01:10:28.751 --> 01:10:33.550
laugh.
The joke was not funny.
If I get a laugh than I guess I'm on to something.

1110
01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:37.600
There isn't a bunch of thought that goes into the funny moments that we think

1111
01:10:37.601 --> 01:10:40.130
may be great bits.
Yeah.

1112
01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:44.620
I wish that I had a more logical answer to put behind it.
I said,
but I don't,

1113
01:10:44.621 --> 01:10:45.970
especially at that time of my career,

1114
01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:51.290
I just thought it would be funny the same way that some people think sir jokes,

1115
01:10:51.291 --> 01:10:52.540
one of the offer,
it's a thought.

1116
01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.240
Comedians are constantly throwing shit out there.
Yeah.

1117
01:10:55.530 --> 01:11:00.430
Constantly rolling a dice and throwing shit out there had the shit you role and

1118
01:11:00.431 --> 01:11:04.900
good.
Right.
It's not going to be good.
The other half,
maybe all right,

1119
01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:06.730
may be kind of good,

1120
01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:11.950
but it's all with the intent of entertaining is not with the intent of being

1121
01:11:11.951 --> 01:11:16.951
malicious is not what the intent of sparking hatred is all trying to make you

1122
01:11:17.431 --> 01:11:19.380
laugh.
Yeah.
That's it.
Like it's,

1123
01:11:19.381 --> 01:11:24.381
it's literally that simple from a thought within a comedian's mind.

1124
01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.610
Yeah.
Nothing,
nothing else.

1125
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:32.270
And they kept trying to look for this like hard definition of why.

1126
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:34.980
And I was like,
I don't have it.

1127
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:40.050
I don't have the reason why I thought it would be funny.

1128
01:11:40.051 --> 01:11:44.610
And it wasn't.
That's the downfall.
That's it.

1129
01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:45.503
That's it.

1130
01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.730
<v 3>And the thing is about this art form is that up until 10 15 years ago,</v>

1131
01:11:49.731 --> 01:11:53.720
there was never any discussion like this.
It wasn't so much.

1132
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:57.920
So when we developed and when we were coming up,
there was no,
it was just like,

1133
01:11:57.921 --> 01:12:00.320
and there was always guys that would push the envelope way too far.

1134
01:12:00.321 --> 01:12:03.430
I believe Jesus Christ,
you see as new bid,
what the fuck?
Yeah.

1135
01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:06.810
And you'd be laughing.
Yeah.
You tell it to each other and be like,
well,
yeah.

1136
01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:11.000
And it didn't matter what it was a joke about murder or rape or what are the,

1137
01:12:11.001 --> 01:12:13.610
some people just date choose those dark subjects.

1138
01:12:13.611 --> 01:12:17.000
It's like they're trying to make us laugh.
Yeah.
Comedians,

1139
01:12:17.001 --> 01:12:18.050
the comedian's comedian.

1140
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:20.880
There's always going to be though what you just in about your own,

1141
01:12:21.010 --> 01:12:23.990
do you know Brian Holtzman a hundred percent Brandon Holtzman.
Is that God?

1142
01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:29.290
What am I enjoying?
My funniest dudes and,
and,
and there's no way,

1143
01:12:29.291 --> 01:12:33.470
like I say no,
some of the stuff that I,
and we say Susan Smith,

1144
01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:38.350
that lady who drowned her kids,
I know,
I know who you're talking about.
Yeah.

1145
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:42.710
And I know the moment.
Yeah.
But I,
I'm not familiar with all,

1146
01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:47.570
all that involve Holtzman was on stage that week and he's like,

1147
01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:52.100
I heard those kids were bad.
Oh my God.
I heard they sat that close to the TV.

1148
01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:54.380
They never put away their blocks.
There was spilt the milk.

1149
01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:58.880
Those kids will not be missed.
Yeah.
And you were just like,
what in the fuck?

1150
01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:02.610
I was like nine 11,
when nine 11 happened,
they wouldn't let him onstage.
Wow.

1151
01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:06.530
Mitzi shore would not let him onstage for months after nine 11.
She's like,

1152
01:13:06.531 --> 01:13:10.250
no way.
Keep them off the stage.
I can't,
I mean do you have,

1153
01:13:10.251 --> 01:13:14.960
do you have the people that just are dead?
They go for that.
They go for it.

1154
01:13:14.961 --> 01:13:17.090
Cause they want to hear you how in the back of the room,

1155
01:13:17.150 --> 01:13:20.810
they know that like if it's,
you know,
comics are there in the back of the room,

1156
01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:23.030
they're going to laugh their fucking ass off at that shit.

1157
01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:28.000
<v 2>And,
and you know,
it's weird because right now within the times,</v>

1158
01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:33.990
um,
I'm the comedian that chooses to be sensitive to the times,

1159
01:13:34.330 --> 01:13:38.470
you know,
I've made the choice to say,
I understand.

1160
01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:44.940
I get why he shouldn't say certain things and why you should avoid this,

1161
01:13:45.401 --> 01:13:48.520
that or this.
I,
I understand and I am.

1162
01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:53.490
But then there's other comedians that go,
you know what,
I'm more stage.

1163
01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:57.670
I'm going to be me and I'm not going to do that because people are telling me

1164
01:13:57.671 --> 01:14:02.580
that this is what I,
I'm going to go harder.
And do that.
That's,
yeah,

1165
01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:05.410
that just exists.
It just exists.

1166
01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:08.140
But I think it's easier to just say,

1167
01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:11.890
I'm not a fan that comedy for me.
Right.

1168
01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:17.080
<v 0>You know what?
I don't,
I don't like the taste of this particular comedian,</v>

1169
01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.810
so I'm not going to support a watch that comedian.

1170
01:14:19.811 --> 01:14:22.540
I'm going to find another comedian.
There's more to my liking.

1171
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:27.460
I'm going to go and just turn my head like I want us to get back to just

1172
01:14:27.461 --> 01:14:32.110
understanding that you just don't have to support it.
Yeah,
that's it.
Well,

1173
01:14:32.111 --> 01:14:36.190
there's a lot of fucking options.
It's very,
I mean there's so many today,

1174
01:14:36.191 --> 01:14:39.170
yet there's never been more,
never been more comics,
high level.

1175
01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:42.590
I think about how many people were doing Netflix specialists.
There's so many.

1176
01:14:42.591 --> 01:14:44.870
He's never been more,
it's so many stories,

1177
01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:49.980
so I don't understand why there's a push to destroy,

1178
01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:52.230
which you just don't have to support her.

1179
01:14:52.231 --> 01:14:55.900
Like I think it's just a bunch of people that have an ability to influence

1180
01:14:55.901 --> 01:14:59.410
things now that didn't have an ability before and it's like they see a window

1181
01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:01.120
when they want to throw a rock.
It's right there.

1182
01:15:01.121 --> 01:15:05.050
It makes sense and I think there's something that,
but I also think for us,

1183
01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:10.660
like Amit,
for me in particular,
I really like fucked up comedy.
It's one of my,

1184
01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:14.260
it's like I like Quintin Tarantino movies where people get shot and killed.

1185
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:16.520
I don't want anybody to get shot and killed in real life.
Yeah.

1186
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:20.500
But I like fucked up comedy.
Do you know Tim Dillon is?
Yes.

1187
01:15:20.501 --> 01:15:24.190
So do you pull up that fucking video?
Him Being Megan Mccain?

1188
01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:29.800
No,
I'll write it out.
He is a savage dude.

1189
01:15:29.801 --> 01:15:34.540
He goes so hard.
But I saw this video.
I was,
tears are rolling down my eyes.

1190
01:15:34.541 --> 01:15:37.690
I was crying and I was like,
okay,
this guy's needed.

1191
01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:41.410
We need this right now because during this political correct push,

1192
01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:46.510
you got this big giant gay dude.
It doesn't give a fuck.
Let me see is an animal.

1193
01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:47.920
I want to say,
watch this shit.

1194
01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:49.511
<v 1>Father died.</v>

1195
01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:53.830
I had a baby will be raised in captivity.

1196
01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:58.010
It'll be raised privately to be greatest politician that has ever [inaudible].

1197
01:15:58.450 --> 01:16:02.410
My name is Meghan Mccain and I'm on a new show.
Donald Trump,

1198
01:16:02.411 --> 01:16:06.730
that fucking riverboat casino captain is talking about my father again.

1199
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:11.290
My father was tortured for a hundred years for this fucking country and he came

1200
01:16:11.291 --> 01:16:15.850
back and he started seven wars because he's a gentleman.
Fuck you Trump.

1201
01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:19.990
I'm gonna wear my father's skin mask and I'm going to primary Trump from the

1202
01:16:19.991 --> 01:16:24.280
right.
Come on the view,
bitch,
if you're that tough,
come on the view.

1203
01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:28.630
You want it all this time to get a costume drama,
club dance.
You want the shit?

1204
01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:30.610
You want to fuck touch Trump.

1205
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:37.270
You want to suck cock,
but I won't fuck you because the only person I'll fuck.

1206
01:16:37.271 --> 01:16:40.930
I started his clothes off

1207
01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:45.070
before my father died.
I had a baby.

1208
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:51.400
He's the animal folks.
You don't know.

1209
01:16:51.401 --> 01:16:55.510
He's wearing lipstick and a wig and he's smoking a cigarette and address and

1210
01:16:55.511 --> 01:17:00.460
he's all over 300 pounds.
He's such a fucking animal

1211
01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:03.400
fucking animal

1212
01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:09.853
to

1213
01:17:10.570 --> 01:17:14.360
<v 2>fuck you.
Why?
He's only five daddy.
Oh my goodness.</v>

1214
01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:20.530
That's pretty damn.
That's great.
It's out there.
They need that guidance.

1215
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:23.360
We need him.
We need guys like that.

1216
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:28.310
I mean the the where we're just talking about when we said it's like,
it's just,

1217
01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:33.080
it's very easy to just to just say,
you know what,

1218
01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:37.790
the snuff me,
it's fine with it is like
everybody,

1219
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:43.760
everybody's humor is different.
I,
I laughed,
I laughed.
There's a,

1220
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:46.490
there's a,
there's a viral video.

1221
01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.180
It is this old guy trying to hover board.

1222
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:53.020
He's like,
fuck,

1223
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:57.530
he's got to be like 69 70 and you know,

1224
01:17:57.531 --> 01:18:01.370
his grandkids are there.
And he's like,
let me,
let me try it.
Let me,
let me try it.

1225
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:05.660
And this man gets on this hover board and tastes.

1226
01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:08.750
If you saw Mike Tyson following the hover board,

1227
01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:11.330
his fall was worst than Mike Tyson's.

1228
01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:16.420
I'll never seen somebody hit their head harder and my life.

1229
01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:22.180
And I didn't laugh out of wanting to see his old man hurt herself.

1230
01:18:23.690 --> 01:18:28.580
I laughed because it was stupid to try to get on his hoverboard and the first

1231
01:18:28.581 --> 01:18:33.500
place.
And when he got up,
he tells the kids,
was it moving?

1232
01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.133
I

1233
01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:44.280
played this video with everybody because that should make me laugh.

1234
01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:49.280
Some people will watch it and go,
oh no,
no.
Some people will watch it and go,

1235
01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.153
oh,

1236
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:54.590
Oh and other than just died laughing because everybody's humor is different.

1237
01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:58.250
Everybody's fucking hammer is different.
My humor is different.

1238
01:18:58.370 --> 01:19:02.990
Falling makes me laugh.
I don't care who you are.
Falling makes me laugh.

1239
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:06.200
I don't give a shit who you are if you fall in front of me.

1240
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:10.640
No shadow them holding their laughing cause no shot,
no shot.

1241
01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:13.990
You don't stand a chance.
If you fall and hurt and me,

1242
01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:19.670
there is no shadow that I'm not
bust your ass something.

1243
01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:22.520
Something has got to come out.
Falling is funny.

1244
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:27.640
I still think it's hacky.
I still think farts are funny.
When my kids Fart,
I left.

1245
01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:31.300
I still until this day,
it's the funniest shit ever.
Me I it goes out of it.

1246
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:35.850
You stick,
get out of it.
Stay gas.
My little son,
17 months when he fired,

1247
01:19:35.851 --> 01:19:37.220
I laugh.
Something,

1248
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:42.310
something within just the ability to just be fucking silly and stupid.

1249
01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.090
It doesn't always have to have a meaning behind it.
Some shit.
It's just stupid.

1250
01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:51.650
My eight year old farts on cue,
she thinks it's hilarious.
She'll tell you,
listen,

1251
01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:55.580
I got to talk to you about something and she starts laughing.

1252
01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.570
She thinks it's hilarious.
She'll fall down on the couch.
Last thing in the world,

1253
01:19:58.571 --> 01:19:59.690
she can't stop laughing.

1254
01:19:59.691 --> 01:20:02.180
It's the best thing was when you're talking about as a kid,

1255
01:20:02.181 --> 01:20:07.181
that's all you got and should only bit as a kid you got nothing else but farts.

1256
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.250
That's all you get.

1257
01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:12.950
<v 0>That's all you got to.
Maybe we'll have.
You should enjoy it.
This shit.</v>

1258
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:15.870
I still think it's funny folly,
but falling is number one for me.

1259
01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:19.500
Falling is number one.
My wife fell down the steps.

1260
01:20:19.501 --> 01:20:22.710
She got so mad cause I didn't rush to help her.
I laugh.

1261
01:20:23.970 --> 01:20:28.260
She had a wine glass.
Wine was all over the walls.
Oh my God.

1262
01:20:28.650 --> 01:20:32.970
What are the worst falls I've ever seen in my damn life got up cause she was on

1263
01:20:32.971 --> 01:20:36.690
one step.
The of the shoe was all following is funny.
I like it.

1264
01:20:36.810 --> 01:20:40.020
I don't laugh at phone that much.
I just deal with too many injuries.

1265
01:20:40.021 --> 01:20:41.820
I've seen too many people get hurt.
It's not for you.

1266
01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:45.210
Especially old dudes falling down,
hitting their hand.
I'm like,

1267
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:50.100
I'll start thinking about brain trauma and CTE longterm repercussions and that

1268
01:20:50.101 --> 01:20:54.420
the last name after,
after the lab I'm near,
I'm right there with you.

1269
01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.160
They get the less,
probably better.

1270
01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:58.770
I'm right there with you was the one that's going on today.

1271
01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:00.960
If this dude trying to come up the stairs on this other dude,

1272
01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:04.620
did you see that one?
The stumped him and send him flying.
I'm like,

1273
01:21:04.621 --> 01:21:07.040
all I could think of is we don't see it in the video with that guy's head has

1274
01:21:07.041 --> 01:21:11.250
got gotta be smithereens.
Oh my God.
Key.
He had hit his head.
He fell back.

1275
01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:14.700
You haven't seen one of the guy who slipped and fell down a bunch of steps at

1276
01:21:14.701 --> 01:21:16.050
the museum and he falls in the water.

1277
01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:21.810
Keeps going to the goals and what a brilliant,
brilliant.
You can't,

1278
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.520
you can't beat that.
Here's this dude.

1279
01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:26.230
This dude's walking up the stairs and this dude's like,

1280
01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:30.870
get the fuck off my porch.
Stop.
Leave me alone.
And he keeps calling me.
He's like,

1281
01:21:30.871 --> 01:21:35.070
don't do it.
I'll go do it.
And he got smacked.

1282
01:21:35.071 --> 01:21:38.640
The way he fell back.
He was no hands behind them.
That's all head.

1283
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:40.920
That's all head Presevo to Nazi.

1284
01:21:40.921 --> 01:21:45.540
See that kick coming from a guy that says it's sad,

1285
01:21:45.541 --> 01:21:48.960
but you also have to realize a guy that size is carrying all that weight,

1286
01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:52.230
not modeling of a donkey kicks.
Yes,

1287
01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:57.120
100% is caved in and I got stumped,
but to not see it once again.

1288
01:21:57.390 --> 01:22:00.480
I've always thought that about fat people that if you really,
really fat,

1289
01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:04.260
imagine how strong your fucking legs must be.
It's the strongest should ever.

1290
01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:04.770
Yeah.

1291
01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:08.610
If you really get some power behind that kit and also if you've lost the weight,

1292
01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:11.910
you'd have these incredible legs.
That's a,
that's always a a theory.

1293
01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:15.900
Just what's entered here,
but I always wonder if the needs are going to shrink.

1294
01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:20.130
Wait,
what?
Because you see someone from behind,
they're like 500 pounds,

1295
01:22:20.131 --> 01:22:22.710
like their knees or that wine.
I'm like,
okay,
is that the bone?

1296
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:24.870
Is that fat around the bone?

1297
01:22:24.871 --> 01:22:29.220
Like has the bone grown really wide took because your body does.

1298
01:22:29.310 --> 01:22:32.730
Your bones do get denser if you do like heavyweight like this.

1299
01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:35.880
If you look at like power lifter dudes there because they're dense.

1300
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.710
Well heart of it is not just their frame,

1301
01:22:37.711 --> 01:22:41.860
it's that they're constantly lifting heavy things so your body thickens up to

1302
01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:44.280
you as you go.
But you know when,

1303
01:22:44.281 --> 01:22:48.780
when you know people that are large and make the dedication to actually losing

1304
01:22:48.781 --> 01:22:52.230
the weight and they stay away from like the weights and stuff and just do cardio

1305
01:22:52.290 --> 01:22:52.981
is sheds off.

1306
01:22:52.981 --> 01:22:56.720
So fans but he can't like I know I know a couple of friends of mine and lost

1307
01:22:56.730 --> 01:23:01.730
like 130 140 pounds and like if now just fallen in love with fitness to the

1308
01:23:02.851 --> 01:23:07.851
point where it's unbelievable like how their body is transformed and taking a

1309
01:23:08.381 --> 01:23:09.490
liking to the new,

1310
01:23:09.850 --> 01:23:13.780
the new process that they now they get addicted instead of food.

1311
01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:16.450
They get addicted to be in health.
Exactly.
It's totally possible.

1312
01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.130
Totally possible.
I've had,

1313
01:23:18.670 --> 01:23:22.030
I don't know how many people come up to me and said they've lost a hundred

1314
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:25.620
pounds plus because of listening to my show and having fitness experts on and

1315
01:23:25.621 --> 01:23:30.240
diet experts and just talking about staying the fuck away from sugars.

1316
01:23:30.241 --> 01:23:32.090
Say don't eat late at night.
Yes,

1317
01:23:32.091 --> 01:23:36.490
Don sweeting stop eating at a certain time and give yourself more than enough

1318
01:23:36.491 --> 01:23:40.210
time to digest cal.
Your calories.
Start exercising.
Well,
let me,

1319
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:44.770
I think the thing with me that helps me so much as I'm not a food.
You're not,

1320
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:48.180
I'm not a foodie man.
I'm just not.
I mean,

1321
01:23:48.181 --> 01:23:51.760
I was born guy to go eat with I.
I'm just making a turn.
That's it.

1322
01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:56.460
I'm literally just,
what does that,
what does it,
yeah,
that's fine.
Let me get that.

1323
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:59.260
This big chicken,
some brown rice.
That's fine.
I'm good.

1324
01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:02.920
You don't worry about eating healthy,
clean,
healthy eater.

1325
01:24:02.921 --> 01:24:07.120
Because I'm not a Foodie,
so it's not like it doesn't,
it doesn't matter.

1326
01:24:07.121 --> 01:24:10.630
Like I don't have the will or want to eat the bad shit.

1327
01:24:10.690 --> 01:24:14.650
So if you're passing by in and out Burger,
no,
nothing.
No nothing.
Naw,
man,

1328
01:24:14.710 --> 01:24:16.750
I'm black Frat chicken fried chicken cook tonight.

1329
01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:20.590
Now you showed me a pump house.
Popeye's.
Roscoe's is good too,

1330
01:24:20.591 --> 01:24:24.690
but Popeye's really pops over Roscoe's.
Yes,
man.
Popeye's.

1331
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.130
Popeye's is fucking,
I don't know what.

1332
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:30.980
I don't know what's in that chicken bed mats.
Pretty damn good at spicy.
Dammit.

1333
01:24:30.981 --> 01:24:34.090
Do you like the spicy spicy?
Set my ass on fire,
but I'm still going to do it.

1334
01:24:34.190 --> 01:24:35.920
Yeah,
I'm still going to do it,
but I'm just not.

1335
01:24:36.130 --> 01:24:40.050
I can consistently eat the same thing and be fine.
How was pop?

1336
01:24:40.051 --> 01:24:43.450
I was the only one who figured out that red beans and rice is a great thing to

1337
01:24:43.451 --> 01:24:46.210
have on the size.
No one else has it.
It's the best thing ever.

1338
01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:47.171
You know what I mean?

1339
01:24:47.171 --> 01:24:51.790
Why does in Burger King or Mcdonald's Popeye's red beans and rice pop pods is so

1340
01:24:51.791 --> 01:24:52.624
good,

1341
01:24:52.690 --> 01:24:57.460
so good that when I was younger I was about 22 I was on a bike.

1342
01:24:57.461 --> 01:25:01.870
I got hit by a car.
Right.
Not too hard to where I was damaged,

1343
01:25:02.050 --> 01:25:03.940
but I have Popeye's in my hand.

1344
01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:08.860
Like the bag I was riding on my bike and holding it one hand,
but got hit.

1345
01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.130
Never let go of the bag.
Wow.

1346
01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:16.390
That's how good pop Oz's the bike,
everything else.

1347
01:25:16.810 --> 01:25:20.410
Boom.
I'm there.
Popeye's held on to it.

1348
01:25:20.710 --> 01:25:24.310
Nothing was damaged.
It still took her home,
finished at meal.
That's incredible.

1349
01:25:24.311 --> 01:25:28.030
That's how get Popeye's is.
100%.
So that's my cheat,
my cheat.

1350
01:25:28.031 --> 01:25:30.940
It's Popeye's all day.
Other than that,
I'm a consistent either.
I'm healthy guy.

1351
01:25:31.450 --> 01:25:35.740
So do you take vitamins or supplements or anything?
I used to take,
uh,

1352
01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.860
multivitamins,
which inspired me to start doing my own.

1353
01:25:38.890 --> 01:25:43.780
Like right now we got bicycle shorts.
I'm a,

1354
01:25:43.781 --> 01:25:46.030
I'm starting my own supplement line.

1355
01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:50.800
Vital Hustle is like the love of vitamin that will kind of put it out.

1356
01:25:50.801 --> 01:25:52.210
But let me tell you why though.

1357
01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:54.580
I'm going to tell you why I'm even getting into this space.

1358
01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:58.300
So when I look at physical fitness and I look at this world,

1359
01:25:58.690 --> 01:26:02.680
I noticed that you know,
you have,
uh,
you have uh,
uh,

1360
01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:04.370
a great

1361
01:26:04.850 --> 01:26:09.530
<v 2>what in need to look like.
Everything around you that you see,
like everybody.</v>

1362
01:26:09.531 --> 01:26:11.300
Like everybody that's a part of this world.

1363
01:26:11.301 --> 01:26:15.440
They look so fucking great and fit when a talking about these products and the

1364
01:26:15.441 --> 01:26:17.960
things that they can do.
And I said,
you know what,

1365
01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:22.040
what I'm able to do and what I've done in my past,

1366
01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:27.380
I'm always bringing people together of all,

1367
01:26:27.381 --> 01:26:30.500
like in whole like there is nobody's alienated.
You know,

1368
01:26:30.501 --> 01:26:34.490
when I did my runs with Nike and before I got signed my Nike,

1369
01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:38.210
it was about bringing a bunch of people that never ran before and getting you

1370
01:26:38.211 --> 01:26:40.580
guys to get up,
just come run with me,
just try it.

1371
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.670
And you notice I got people out that never thought they would fucking do it.

1372
01:26:43.671 --> 01:26:47.270
And we doing five miles,
we don't tend miles,
whatever.
It's just a group run.

1373
01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:49.400
Something to say we did.
I said,

1374
01:26:49.401 --> 01:26:54.401
how can I create a product where I'm putting people in a position to understand

1375
01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:58.580
there's a hustle and all of us?

1376
01:26:59.150 --> 01:27:03.350
That's what my multivitamin is about is the energy is to recharge.

1377
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:08.510
It's the ability to focus is to approach a day with all of the tools that you

1378
01:27:08.511 --> 01:27:11.330
basically need.
It's not just about the physical fitness aspect,

1379
01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:12.403
it's about the health.

1380
01:27:12.650 --> 01:27:17.540
So if I can actually motivate people to take the step in the right direction of

1381
01:27:17.541 --> 01:27:22.541
health with a line of supplements that are driven for the every day individual

1382
01:27:25.131 --> 01:27:29.420
that may not know or be aware,
but once to engage,

1383
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:31.730
but you're not in it to look like all these different people,

1384
01:27:31.731 --> 01:27:34.520
you're in it to be the best version of yourself.
How can I do that?

1385
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:39.050
Teamed up with a great group of people to create the best possible products that

1386
01:27:39.051 --> 01:27:41.660
I want to do.
And I said I want to be patient.
So it took me four years,

1387
01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:44.810
four years to create by the hustle and how many different products you go right

1388
01:27:44.811 --> 01:27:49.070
now,
just vitas.
Vita hustle was my only one right now.
So it's just a vitamin.

1389
01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:51.710
Just a multivitamin,
but it's an amazing multivitamin.

1390
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.130
But is it a single pill or is it a packet?
But now it's a,
it's a jar.

1391
01:27:55.131 --> 01:27:59.220
I should've fucking bought one.
Good job.
Jar.
Jesus Christ.
Let's mix it.

1392
01:27:59.221 --> 01:28:03.460
And so it was stuff.
No,
it's a jar full.
It like a pill.
Yes.
Pills.
Okay.

1393
01:28:03.690 --> 01:28:08.310
Um,
I'm gonna tell you the dope stuff.
This that's in it.
Um,

1394
01:28:08.430 --> 01:28:11.900
cause I don't want to not say anything and have it to where it's wrong.

1395
01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:16.250
So I always show up on the screen,
man.
Look,

1396
01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:21.650
how good is he,
man?
Jesus Christ.
I get it,
man.
Hey,
you got to see it.

1397
01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:26.680
That's why you hear the same thing on my phone.
Blueberry fruit,
extra scroll,

1398
01:28:26.690 --> 01:28:30.020
Scroll back up there.
Boron,
Biotin,
bit of carrots,
right in my name.

1399
01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:34.880
It's all good shirt.
It's all good shit.
It's more than a multivitamin.

1400
01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:38.080
I'll put them in a good e.

1401
01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:42.760
What does that stuff Toko.
Trenell,
tocotrienols.

1402
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:47.450
Tocotrienols,
vitamin E family.
You've heard of that gym.
Vitamin K,

1403
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:51.470
look it up.
All right,
look it up.
Gastrointestinal.

1404
01:28:51.471 --> 01:28:55.580
It's a good thing too.
Is that everything that's in it,
you know,

1405
01:28:55.670 --> 01:28:59.870
it's not only as a researchable,
but you'll see why.

1406
01:29:00.170 --> 01:29:04.710
Like my biggest,
like as a guy who's not as familiar with the space,

1407
01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:07.290
I said,
who are the people that are,

1408
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:11.430
they do it at a high level that I can incorporate into helping me build this

1409
01:29:11.431 --> 01:29:15.570
product.
So I feel like you're never going to do it by yourself.

1410
01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.900
You shouldn't try to do by yourself and you don't cut corners.

1411
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:21.840
You don't go the cheap route,
you don't,
you don't do it wrong.

1412
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:23.600
So then you have to go back and do it again.
Right.

1413
01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:27.330
So I went and I looked at the people that were involved with creating the quote

1414
01:29:27.331 --> 01:29:31.920
unquote best market,
the best things on the market.
And I put that team together,

1415
01:29:31.970 --> 01:29:33.930
put up a team of like four to five.

1416
01:29:33.931 --> 01:29:36.450
I'm going to tell you four years I spent a lot of money developing this shit

1417
01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:39.960
because it wasn't right in the beginning.
Had to go back,
had to do it again.

1418
01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.400
It wasn't right.
It had to go back,

1419
01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:43.950
find out the other things that made of the things better of things.

1420
01:29:43.951 --> 01:29:48.270
Great had to go,
right,
go get it again,
go try it,
go do it again.
Not Right.

1421
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:50.100
What else is out there?
What do we compare it to?

1422
01:29:50.101 --> 01:29:52.260
And so I felt that now when I launch,

1423
01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:55.920
there's going to be a place for my product in a market where people will

1424
01:29:55.921 --> 01:30:00.480
understand that it's exactly what I said it was.
There's no lying.

1425
01:30:00.481 --> 01:30:03.630
There is no,
you know,
false presentation behind a product.

1426
01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:07.380
Kevin Hart's Multivitamin as much more than a multivitamin,
but more importantly,

1427
01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:12.150
it's something for everybody and more importantly is to spark the hustle within

1428
01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:15.420
all of us.
And this is the first,
there will be more,

1429
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:18.840
but it will be after I've mastered,
done this at the highest level,

1430
01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:21.630
then I moved to product number two,
then I moved the product number three.

1431
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:22.583
Before you know it,

1432
01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:26.370
you want to see a fucking whole line that Kevin Hart to slowly developed and

1433
01:30:26.371 --> 01:30:31.260
that people can actually believe in because I'm a be a product of my own
product.

1434
01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:33.480
That's the best thing in the world.

1435
01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:37.190
When you're a product of your product has to work for me before I say it's going

1436
01:30:37.191 --> 01:30:40.710
to work for everybody else.
So you take this stuff,
he got damn right,
I take it.

1437
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:42.980
How long were you taking that?
I spent all his fucking money on it.

1438
01:30:42.990 --> 01:30:45.480
That might have taken a bit.
Taking the,

1439
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:49.010
the one that's launching now for about five to six months.
Nice.

1440
01:30:49.050 --> 01:30:50.130
I've been taking this one.

1441
01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:55.530
I'm very happy because I actually feel the difference and the differences just

1442
01:30:55.531 --> 01:31:00.000
in the energy that you have with them.
There's not an energy fucking pill,

1443
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:03.270
but I do feel a difference in my,

1444
01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:09.300
in my ability to last throughout my day.
Like I'm,
I do a lot,
man.

1445
01:31:09.570 --> 01:31:12.270
I do a fucking lot.
So I told you I'm starting at that five,

1446
01:31:12.271 --> 01:31:17.271
five 30 and I'm not shutting down to let nine 10 so our video once where you

1447
01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:22.350
were taking a video of your,
your trainer passed out.
Yeah.

1448
01:31:22.770 --> 01:31:24.050
And you're like this lifestyle.

1449
01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:29.290
It was right around when he shuts down a very unattractive sleeper about away

1450
01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:33.870
shuts out to to balls.
Ronald ever lie,
one of the worst sleepers you'll ever see.

1451
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:37.530
So you take him with you everywhere.
Yeah.
My train has with me everywhere.
Wow.

1452
01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:40.840
Everywhere.
So he trained every day.
Every day.
Wow.
Every day.

1453
01:31:40.841 --> 01:31:45.750
Sunday's a light days.
Light Cardio maintenance will be,
call it.
Uh,

1454
01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:48.270
not doing the same thing all the time.
We switch it up.

1455
01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:53.700
Love switching to the love,
finding new things within fitness to make it fun.

1456
01:31:53.701 --> 01:31:55.750
You never want to get bored within it.
So your,

1457
01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:59.100
your whole purpose is just to keep your vitality up,
keep your energy up,

1458
01:31:59.110 --> 01:32:01.630
just to keep it.
It's,
if I don't do it,

1459
01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:07.440
then there's a leg at a need to train.

1460
01:32:08.771 --> 01:32:13.771
I need to do it because I am mentally so invested in it now that when I don't do

1461
01:32:14.741 --> 01:32:18.040
it,
I feel like I've cheated myself in a,

1462
01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:22.750
in a day or a week that I've taken off.
I feel like Yo,
man,

1463
01:32:22.751 --> 01:32:25.990
I'm not myself because when I am doing it,

1464
01:32:26.410 --> 01:32:28.930
I feel like I'm always,
I'm committed,

1465
01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:33.760
committed to constantly building in reshaping,
in molding.

1466
01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:37.570
I'm working on me.
So when I'm not working on me,

1467
01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:42.960
I don't feel like my day that's supposed to be about me is starting off with the

1468
01:32:44.771 --> 01:32:46.060
biggest bang.
Right.

1469
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:50.080
This is my advantage to starting off like nobody else.

1470
01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:54.960
My Day starts off before fucking worms in birds get up.
I'm,

1471
01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:58.530
we're time to get up five,
five.
And that's when you start working out a gym.

1472
01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:02.800
Five 15,
five,
25,
15,
five 20,
no food.

1473
01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:05.010
I don't eat.
I don't eat before a workout.
Yeah.

1474
01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:06.730
And that I'm not eating before I work out.

1475
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.840
Never had been now what I am now because I'm getting older,

1476
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:15.550
I'm more conscious of my body.
So I'm big with sports massages.
I'm big with,

1477
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:18.640
you know,
making sure that Ah,
I'm,

1478
01:33:18.641 --> 01:33:22.940
I'm not putting myself in a position to get injured and overworked.
Right.

1479
01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:27.190
So,
uh,
getting stretched,
you know,
trying to,

1480
01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:31.510
to do as much movement,
um,
that as I possibly can.

1481
01:33:31.511 --> 01:33:35.950
Like when I say I'm a little walking muscle,
I really am.

1482
01:33:35.951 --> 01:33:39.430
So my flexibility is limited.
So right now that's my biggest focus.

1483
01:33:39.431 --> 01:33:42.100
So I'm about to start yoga,
trying to do that.

1484
01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:45.460
Things that can just kind of keep me in a position to,
to not tie in notes.

1485
01:33:45.461 --> 01:33:48.890
I don't pull anything cause I do so much.
You're going to do hot yoga.
Yoga.
Yeah.

1486
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:51.700
How y'all do that shit all the time.
Do you really love it?
Amazing

1487
01:33:51.810 --> 01:33:52.970
<v 3>Dude.
Every week.
Yeah.
On it.</v>

1488
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:55.440
Then it's kept me from doing it as the smell at as possibly in Navajo.

1489
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:58.470
That's the only thing that's kept me out of it.
I was like,

1490
01:33:58.490 --> 01:34:01.410
you gotta move past that.
Yeah,
but that's what I hear.
I get pretty bad.

1491
01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:04.440
That's how sometimes it can hurt the police.
I go,
it was nice.

1492
01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:08.500
You just got to make sure that the people take care of themselves well,
you know,

1493
01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:11.400
be around smelly people.
I'll be honest with you,
I'm worried about myself.

1494
01:34:11.401 --> 01:34:12.234
I don't know what I'm gonna get.

1495
01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:16.230
Especially if you get there early in the morning and you know eat,

1496
01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:19.410
you won't worry about farting.
Yeah.
But the people that eat breakfast,

1497
01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:23.180
you're letting off and everything.
I had explained that to killer Mike.

1498
01:34:23.190 --> 01:34:27.390
He was talking to me about farting in the yoga class.
Can't be eating.
No,

1499
01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:30.030
you can't be eating before that earlier you gone.

1500
01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:34.980
I like to go either 6:00 AM which is rare most of the time,

1501
01:34:35.010 --> 01:34:39.180
eight eight eight 30 depends on where,
which place I go to too.

1502
01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:42.060
But you love it though.
Yeah,
I love it.
It's great for your head too.

1503
01:34:42.061 --> 01:34:46.450
It's 90 minutes of suffering,
you know it's hard.
It's fucking 105 degrees,

1504
01:34:46.451 --> 01:34:49.810
140 degrees.
When you get out of there,
you feel like you did something.
Yeah.

1505
01:34:50.010 --> 01:34:54.540
And it just changes the way your body feels too in terms of your range of
motion,

1506
01:34:54.541 --> 01:34:58.310
your flexibility,
all those weird connecting knots and everything

1507
01:34:58.310 --> 01:35:01.970
<v 0>just get opened up.
And so my question is when you,</v>

1508
01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:05.300
when you're just starting now,
like,
like I will be,

1509
01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:09.560
is it extremely tough in the beginning because you just got to bring a lot of

1510
01:35:09.561 --> 01:35:13.320
ice water.
Just bring a big old fucking 64 ounce,
one of those uh,

1511
01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:16.850
thermal flasks of ice water.

1512
01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:20.930
Make sure you have enough water and drink enough water before it put me in a
bag.

1513
01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:23.360
Yeah,
I understand that.
I don't need to be where people could see me.

1514
01:35:23.361 --> 01:35:26.150
Just wa what did he got?
Like a section in the back.
Yeah,

1515
01:35:26.151 --> 01:35:28.510
but you turn left and you turn right.
Everyone's going to see you.

1516
01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:29.080
That's what I'm saying.

1517
01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:32.360
Can I be in a place where they don't see me in the beginning?

1518
01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:35.360
Like I don't want anybody to see your athletic man.
You're going to be fine.

1519
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:36.170
You're going to be tight.

1520
01:35:36.170 --> 01:35:39.590
It's going to be difficult for you to pull off certain poses,
but you'll be fine.

1521
01:35:39.650 --> 01:35:42.380
I'm definitely gonna do it.
I'm done.
And then you realize it's a challenge.

1522
01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:47.100
I'm definitely 100% going to try.
You ever fuck would you do to no,
that's next.

1523
01:35:47.150 --> 01:35:51.080
Yeah.
That's next to hear that has an x.
Just just listen.

1524
01:35:51.081 --> 01:35:55.990
This is what Rico was laughing because I say,
Oh man,
the left on the taters,

1525
01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:00.530
I've never thrown a kick.
As I said,
whatever you shoved me right now.

1526
01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:04.640
It was my first time doing it.
I don't,
I don't kick,
I don't know how to kick.

1527
01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.670
So whatever you show me this is,

1528
01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:11.330
this'll be me processing it for the first time and that day we did it.

1529
01:36:11.331 --> 01:36:13.760
We worked on in that they have to do a couple good kicks,

1530
01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:17.360
a couple of good front kick and I said,
I said,
look,
after I'm done with boxing,

1531
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:21.440
I said this will be my next task is to learn how to properly throw some kicks

1532
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:24.440
and to move with my bottom half.

1533
01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:28.580
Now that I've worked on my top and that's my next hobby.
That's your next house.

1534
01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:30.200
But Jujitsu,

1535
01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:36.220
Jujitsu is like Tussen and chokes and talking about you want to do that too.

1536
01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.430
Just this stuff.
As you get older you have to find shit to do.

1537
01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:43.490
If you don't find shit to do,
you want to lose your mind.

1538
01:36:43.610 --> 01:36:45.980
You would get addicted to that.
I just want to tell her shit.

1539
01:36:45.981 --> 01:36:48.440
You would like it because there's so much to learn.
That's the thing about it.

1540
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:51.740
It's,
it's a long,
long never ending,
never ending,

1541
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:54.320
never ending journey of shit.
There's also,

1542
01:36:54.321 --> 01:36:58.490
there's so many different variations of each different individual move and

1543
01:36:58.550 --> 01:37:02.960
entries into new moves and defense.
And then the structure of it is,

1544
01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:08.110
it gets so crazy.
It's so,
it's super complicated.
And my son,
my son does,
uh,

1545
01:37:08.210 --> 01:37:12.110
my son is heavy and to boxing and karate,
I got him into those.
So he,

1546
01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.900
he does them both.
So the reason why I want to do,

1547
01:37:14.901 --> 01:37:18.860
I'd just like to keep up with him so we can,
you know,
do things together.

1548
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:22.100
I have trainers come to the house and we'll work out together.
He loves it.

1549
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:25.790
So I just don't want to get left behind too.
I can't do,

1550
01:37:27.190 --> 01:37:31.630
you know,
when he get 17,
18,
which you say,
Daddy,
hold on.
Oh boy,

1551
01:37:31.670 --> 01:37:32.690
I don't want that boy.

1552
01:37:32.691 --> 01:37:35.840
You better back up when he started getting that much confidence.

1553
01:37:35.841 --> 01:37:38.630
I just want to be able to keep up and maintain.

1554
01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:41.810
So that's why I like to do it with them.
What's good for a kid?

1555
01:37:41.811 --> 01:37:45.080
To have them in your head to defend yourself.
Confidence.

1556
01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:49.340
You need that for confidence.
It'll help you avoid things too.
Well,

1557
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:50.930
I tell my kids,

1558
01:37:51.110 --> 01:37:56.110
you know your last name puts a target your back that you didn't ask

1559
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:59.520
<v 2>for.
And we don't go and create problems,</v>

1560
01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:03.960
but you should always be prepared for problems if they were to occur.

1561
01:38:03.961 --> 01:38:07.470
And if they do,
I just want you guys to know how to defend yourself.

1562
01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:10.330
So the things that I have my kids doing,

1563
01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:12.610
just have the knowledge and understanding.

1564
01:38:12.611 --> 01:38:14.730
And the worst thing is just not knowing.
You know,

1565
01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:18.510
they're growing up complete different than I grew up where I grew up.

1566
01:38:18.511 --> 01:38:21.930
You had no choice but to know if you ain't know how to fight that shit ass

1567
01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:24.600
because you're going to get tested.
There's no way around it.

1568
01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:27.630
You're going to get tried.
You're going to get robbed.

1569
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:29.460
You're going to get your book bag.
Take it.

1570
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:32.310
So am I gonna try to take you sneaks like it's the reality.

1571
01:38:32.311 --> 01:38:35.940
It's not a false reality that's real.
So if you're not prepared for it,

1572
01:38:35.941 --> 01:38:39.510
if you don't have any type of heart,
you won't.
Last.

1573
01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:44.490
From where I grew up,
heart was everything.
And heart was sometimes saying,

1574
01:38:44.491 --> 01:38:48.660
I don't care if I get my ass whooped.
I'm not going to be a bitch.
I'm not gonna.

1575
01:38:48.690 --> 01:38:51.330
I'm not gonna allow y'all to think that this can happen.

1576
01:38:51.331 --> 01:38:52.560
So I'm going to lose today,

1577
01:38:53.130 --> 01:38:55.940
but tomorrow I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna find you.
I'm gonna talk.

1578
01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:57.420
Whatever that moment was,

1579
01:38:57.810 --> 01:39:02.370
it was about establishing any level of respect that you could and I respect

1580
01:39:02.371 --> 01:39:04.290
eventually turned into friendship from all.

1581
01:39:04.530 --> 01:39:08.310
So my kids don't know what that world is like.
They're never going to have it.

1582
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:09.900
So as a parent,

1583
01:39:09.901 --> 01:39:14.580
I just have to make sure that you have all the tools that I can possibly equip

1584
01:39:14.581 --> 01:39:19.050
you with because my parents didn't have the ability to provide me with that.

1585
01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:23.540
They weren't in a financial space to to take me here and had this extra

1586
01:39:23.541 --> 01:39:25.910
curricular activity or this extracurricular activity and learn this,

1587
01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:27.450
learn that didn't exist.

1588
01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:31.110
That is the big conundrum of successful clay bird.

1589
01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:34.890
When successful people have kids,

1590
01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:38.370
the what made them successful is dry.
I grew up poor too.

1591
01:39:38.371 --> 01:39:41.640
We were on welfare and food stamps and we'll do it when I was a little kid.

1592
01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:44.610
And that always stuck in my head.

1593
01:39:44.611 --> 01:39:46.950
This thought like we might not have enough food.

1594
01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:48.990
Like I remember thinking that when I was little,
like,

1595
01:39:49.090 --> 01:39:51.360
what if we don't have any food?
What if we run out of food?

1596
01:39:52.110 --> 01:39:54.840
My kids will never feel that.
They don't understand what that is.

1597
01:39:55.050 --> 01:39:58.770
And everybody that I've ever met that's interesting came from some crazy

1598
01:39:58.771 --> 01:40:02.330
struggle when they were young.
Yeah.
And that's the thing of you're,

1599
01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:06.660
you and I and most people that are doing well in life,

1600
01:40:06.661 --> 01:40:10.410
you're raising your kids in a completely different way than literally what

1601
01:40:10.411 --> 01:40:11.460
brought you to the dance.

1602
01:40:11.461 --> 01:40:15.270
And the first one is the hunger of not being one of those people that's left

1603
01:40:15.271 --> 01:40:19.200
behind is what makes you successful in the first place.
And it's scary.

1604
01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:23.910
It's scary because,
you know,
my wife,
my wife told me,
she was like,
you know,

1605
01:40:24.450 --> 01:40:26.310
I love that you're not hard on your kids,

1606
01:40:26.311 --> 01:40:30.540
but you always make sure there's a lesson within your conversation.

1607
01:40:30.541 --> 01:40:32.790
Like I don't yell,
I don't yell at my kids.

1608
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:36.990
Nothing's going to register when I'm yelling,
so I'll try my best to talk to you.

1609
01:40:36.991 --> 01:40:38.310
Even when I met my angers,

1610
01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:42.180
I'm a talk to you so you can process this because you need to understand what's

1611
01:40:42.181 --> 01:40:44.310
the problem.
You need to understand what's wrong.

1612
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:49.790
And what I had to really realize is they didn't ask to be born into this.

1613
01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:51.960
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1614
01:40:51.961 --> 01:40:56.961
Like it's not their fault that they're coming up completely different then how

1615
01:40:57.221 --> 01:40:58.240
we were raised.
Right.

1616
01:40:58.630 --> 01:41:03.630
And we can't have anger or frustration that's dedicated and thrown towards them

1617
01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:07.450
because they got it so much better than what we had.

1618
01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:13.080
How do we make sure we passed down to proper lessons so that they appreciate and

1619
01:41:14.111 --> 01:41:18.100
understand and not take for granted,
right.
They have.
For me,

1620
01:41:18.101 --> 01:41:21.880
it's tough because I got good kids because students,

1621
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:27.130
they apply themselves to school.
They listen,
they don't do dumb shit.

1622
01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:30.880
Yeah.
They want to play video games and stay up like any other kid.

1623
01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:35.050
There's no signs of a bad or or or crazy.

1624
01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:40.500
And the fear and panic is that you got to know that bad and crazy exists,

1625
01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:46.810
right?
This fairy tale they were in isn't real,

1626
01:41:46.811 --> 01:41:51.370
and at some point when I'm not around,
when your mother's not around,

1627
01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:54.010
when your friends or other family on around,

1628
01:41:54.130 --> 01:41:59.130
you may get tested with the other side that's out here that you've never seen,

1629
01:42:00.030 --> 01:42:04.300
right?
So I got to prepare you for the shit that you don't know exists.

1630
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:07.330
I got to take you to Philadelphia so you can see.

1631
01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:11.710
I tried to show my kids where I grew up thinking it's going to be like a,

1632
01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:16.510
Oh my goodness backfired.
That's so cool.
Can we live here?
Shut up.

1633
01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:20.850
Fuck you talking about everybody hit a car right now around,

1634
01:42:20.890 --> 01:42:24.190
we talk about this when we get back.
Very,
there's,
this does not go as opposed to,

1635
01:42:24.610 --> 01:42:28.630
oh my gosh,
so cool.
Dad is so different.
Oh my goodness.

1636
01:42:28.631 --> 01:42:32.390
Walked him around a neighborhood and it's like,
it's,
it's,

1637
01:42:32.630 --> 01:42:37.270
it's not a reality.
You didn't have grass kindness,

1638
01:42:37.271 --> 01:42:41.100
dad.
Oh,
that's great.
What'd you play?
Wow.

1639
01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:44.710
When you hear,
when you hear these things,

1640
01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:49.600
it's so different,
man.
These were your steps.
The steps are broken.

1641
01:42:49.601 --> 01:42:54.490
How did you even play?
Oh my God,
that,
so wait,
where?

1642
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:59.350
Where did was yours?
We lived on the top floor.
Not the whole thing.
No,

1643
01:43:00.090 --> 01:43:02.500
it's,
this is three separate units.

1644
01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:05.710
So the top floor was me and grandmom's the middle.

1645
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:09.100
That was somebody else that was a neighbor and downstairs,
somebody else,

1646
01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:13.520
three different people lived in is one thing together.
Y'All are strangers.
Like,

1647
01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:18.910
Hey,
shut up.
Get my own answers.
Everybody in the car get a car.

1648
01:43:18.911 --> 01:43:21.550
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to say at this park.

1649
01:43:21.551 --> 01:43:22.384
Get right in the car.

1650
01:43:22.990 --> 01:43:27.480
But when you see that that's the reality that you get hit with of,

1651
01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:29.650
I gotta make sure that I'm talking.

1652
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:34.150
I got to make sure that I'm constantly teaching.
If I'm not,

1653
01:43:34.810 --> 01:43:37.630
then I'm not doing my part.
I'm failing.
You know,

1654
01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:41.970
took them to the neighborhood and showed them how stores are in the
neighborhood.

1655
01:43:41.971 --> 01:43:43.690
It's what we got candy from.
Here's,

1656
01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:46.490
here's what we would get little sandwiches from y'all walk.

1657
01:43:46.491 --> 01:43:49.360
We don't have no stores like this.
We can't walk to stuff.

1658
01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:52.290
It's a completely different world.
Why?

1659
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:55.310
It's a completely different world.

1660
01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:58.690
See people standing on street corners,
what they do on their B,

1661
01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:02.060
they selling drugs.
That's tough right there.

1662
01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:05.510
Those are people that your dad still knows they'd been there forever.

1663
01:44:06.230 --> 01:44:07.460
That's what you don't want to do,

1664
01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:10.880
but they're forced with these decisions just because of what they have to do.

1665
01:44:11.570 --> 01:44:16.190
You just need to see this dad is take you here to see this drove them all
around,

1666
01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:18.290
all around North Philadelphia,

1667
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:23.770
all around South Philadelphia made sure they could see it physically.

1668
01:44:23.901 --> 01:44:26.630
See,
we go out the country,

1669
01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:29.150
we go to these resorts and islands before we go there.

1670
01:44:29.151 --> 01:44:33.410
We won't drive around so you can see what exists before you get to this.

1671
01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:36.110
This is why we have to be good people.

1672
01:44:36.590 --> 01:44:40.820
This is why we treat everybody with respect.
This is why your dad likes to give.

1673
01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:43.400
Everybody doesn't have,

1674
01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:48.950
I'm constantly beaten my kids with that information because then you assume that

1675
01:44:48.951 --> 01:44:49.910
everybody does.

1676
01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:53.830
You come off like such an ass hole when you're around people that don't.
Yeah,

1677
01:44:54.230 --> 01:44:55.490
what you don't

1678
01:44:56.530 --> 01:45:00.460
<v 0>awesome.
The advantage that they had grown up the way they are now.</v>

1679
01:45:00.850 --> 01:45:04.120
It's such a rare thing and they don't understand it.

1680
01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:07.990
There's no way they could small percentage,
a very small percentage.

1681
01:45:08.410 --> 01:45:10.420
<v 2>And that's something that I'd never want to let go of either.</v>

1682
01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:14.290
So I was in the back of my head so high.
You're talking about how,
you know,

1683
01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:16.480
are we going to have enough food when you were coming up?

1684
01:45:17.050 --> 01:45:22.050
Chris rock's joke is so great that he said tell by how he keeps a bag packed at

1685
01:45:22.481 --> 01:45:23.740
the front door.
Cause he don't

1686
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:25.900
<v 0>believed that this shit is,
he is,</v>

1687
01:45:28.530 --> 01:45:32.990
I truly believe that at any point somebody's going to go,
Gotcha.

1688
01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:38.750
You thought you lived here,
did this eight joy.
And I was like,
it's so real.

1689
01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:40.880
Because even though you have it,

1690
01:45:40.881 --> 01:45:45.810
you can't lose the sight of reality of where you once was.
Yeah.

1691
01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:47.270
Do you,

1692
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:50.840
are you comfortable where you are now or do you still have those thoughts?

1693
01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:53.750
Like this is this real cause you're,

1694
01:45:53.751 --> 01:45:58.510
you're at the stratosphere of fame and success.
That's it.

1695
01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:02.450
It's rare amongst the rare,
you know,
it's uh,
like David Goggin said,

1696
01:46:02.451 --> 01:46:04.730
you are uncommon amongst uncommon men.

1697
01:46:05.410 --> 01:46:10.410
<v 2>I will be a hundred percent honest and say I'm comfortable</v>

1698
01:46:13.210 --> 01:46:18.210
with the understanding of hard work brings great rewards.

1699
01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:24.300
This is a reminder of the hard work and dedication that I put into everything

1700
01:46:24.431 --> 01:46:25.264
that I've done.

1701
01:46:26.110 --> 01:46:31.110
I'm not content because I know where I came from and I don't ever want to go

1702
01:46:32.890 --> 01:46:36.550
back.
That doesn't mean I don't want to go back to the city.

1703
01:46:36.551 --> 01:46:39.190
That doesn't mean I'm going to go back to the people that made that don't want

1704
01:46:39.191 --> 01:46:42.490
to go back to living like I once was.

1705
01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:46.660
I'm going to go back and I want to help.
I want to inspire them,
motivate.

1706
01:46:46.930 --> 01:46:51.330
I want to show people to,
there is a way out.
That is a way to do more,

1707
01:46:51.331 --> 01:46:53.070
to get more,
to obtain more.

1708
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:57.510
But I personally don't want to lose all that I've been able to get.

1709
01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:03.650
So I need to make sure I do everything to keep it
so I can't be consent.

1710
01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:08.400
Hmm.
So there is an understanding,

1711
01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:13.560
but I refuse to click on the switch of hi.

1712
01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:16.180
<v 3>So even if you like,</v>

1713
01:47:16.410 --> 01:47:19.590
even if you have more money than you'll ever spend for the rest of your life,

1714
01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:21.380
that's not what it's about.

1715
01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:27.140
It's about the inspiring people and the influence and constantly giving back and

1716
01:47:28.141 --> 01:47:31.220
moving forward in a positive way.
And the only way you can do that as a stack,

1717
01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:34.270
<v 2>it's the story,
man.
Yeah.
You know where,</v>

1718
01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:38.680
where we're all writing a book.
What's your book look like?

1719
01:47:40.690 --> 01:47:44.410
What is your fucking book look like?
Like,
yeah,
your life is a book.

1720
01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:48.400
You got a bunch of chapters in your book,
but when they closed that book,

1721
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:53.780
how good was the book?
How good was your book?

1722
01:47:53.781 --> 01:47:56.330
What was the ending to your book?

1723
01:47:56.990 --> 01:48:01.990
If the ending to my book can be so amazing because of all that was done,

1724
01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:05.510
not the money,

1725
01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:10.520
all that was accomplish the first to do the man that did this.

1726
01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:14.690
He calls the merger between this,
because of his commitment and growth to this,

1727
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:17.870
the communities would then,
given this made education,

1728
01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:22.370
this change the way to schooling was blah,
blah,
blah,
gave books,

1729
01:48:22.610 --> 01:48:23.600
gave computers,

1730
01:48:23.601 --> 01:48:28.601
gave all of the things that can be associated with you and your existence become

1731
01:48:29.391 --> 01:48:34.340
a part of the chapters in your book.
So my drive is about my book.

1732
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:40.050
I was in New York Times number one bestseller.
People will be done.

1733
01:48:40.051 --> 01:48:44.400
He did it right in another book.
Yeah.

1734
01:48:44.430 --> 01:48:45.263
What's it happened?

1735
01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:49.620
What happens if you are to Tom New York Times number one bestseller?

1736
01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:54.510
If you get the two,
what happens if you get the three hey man,

1737
01:48:54.511 --> 01:48:56.670
how to books become successful?
Who publishes them?

1738
01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:00.000
I want to start a publishing company.
Hartbeat publishing.
Why not?

1739
01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:02.190
That's the thing.

1740
01:49:02.190 --> 01:49:07.190
All I'm doing is sparking the awareness in others to go,

1741
01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:11.580
why not?
Why can't I create?
Why can't I start?

1742
01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:15.060
Why can't I be a business?
Why can't I be a CEO?

1743
01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:17.040
Why came I be a Tech Guru?

1744
01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:21.600
Why came I fucking create cooking products,
lotions.

1745
01:49:21.601 --> 01:49:25.770
Since there's so much that some people just don't understand,
they can do.

1746
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:30.360
Let me be a spark to show how much,
how many different that you don't have to do.

1747
01:49:30.361 --> 01:49:32.790
Just one thing.
When it's all said and done,

1748
01:49:32.791 --> 01:49:37.290
my book is going to be full of all the shit that Kevin Hart date cause I never

1749
01:49:37.291 --> 01:49:40.770
was content with doing just one,
two or three.

1750
01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:44.550
Why not,
Kevin?

1751
01:49:44.551 --> 01:49:48.730
Why are you creating fucking health and wellness products?
Why not?

1752
01:49:49.670 --> 01:49:51.480
I'm big one,
health and wellness.
Why can't I?

1753
01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:57.360
Why can't I try to create something that I've filled is fucking great and jump

1754
01:49:57.911 --> 01:50:02.530
into a space that I'm already in.
I already give 100% of me in this space.

1755
01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:03.993
Why not?

1756
01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:08.890
Why can't I talk about financial wealth?

1757
01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:12.850
Why can I go back in,
educate those that don't know.
Why not?

1758
01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:16.230
You don't get Tom,
I make town,
which you certainly can.

1759
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:20.650
It's just so unusual that someone dedicates that much energy and time to giving

1760
01:50:20.651 --> 01:50:24.610
back and getting involved with the kind of projects that you're talking about as

1761
01:50:24.611 --> 01:50:29.200
well as be super ambitious with your own career.
It makes me happy.
Yeah.

1762
01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:31.900
I could tell I'm,
I'm genuinely happy.

1763
01:50:32.590 --> 01:50:34.990
Discovery makes me happy.

1764
01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:39.700
Like when you find different things to be excited about,

1765
01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:44.530
it makes me happy and it's weird when it clicks in school.

1766
01:50:44.531 --> 01:50:46.720
They used to tell you all the time,
information is key.

1767
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:49.900
Read these books is so much knowledge.
He man fuck that book.

1768
01:50:50.530 --> 01:50:52.720
Got Ton of read that book.
I want to go home,

1769
01:50:53.150 --> 01:50:55.420
got damn sonic the hedgehog that that want to play.

1770
01:50:55.421 --> 01:50:57.910
I'm at level three I ain't got time to read this book.

1771
01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:03.610
The information and stuff that was forced down your throat at a certain age,

1772
01:51:03.611 --> 01:51:08.020
you just,
you just may not be receiving it correctly,
but then it clicks.

1773
01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:13.900
You may gain information differently and what you do with that information is up

1774
01:51:13.901 --> 01:51:17.920
to you,
but people,
people have different roles.
They can go down.

1775
01:51:18.850 --> 01:51:23.030
The education wasn't my pick of choice,
it,

1776
01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:24.580
it didn't do it for me,

1777
01:51:25.150 --> 01:51:30.150
but the knowledge and the common sense that I have naturally allow me to gain

1778
01:51:30.461 --> 01:51:32.950
information,
apply it differently.

1779
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:37.950
It allowed me to grow smart in so many different avenues to where I said,

1780
01:51:38.861 --> 01:51:40.540
oh my God,
I found my niche.

1781
01:51:40.541 --> 01:51:45.400
I found my talent and now there's other things that my talent can take me to.

1782
01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:48.010
I don't have the all the knowledge and awareness,

1783
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:51.280
but I can align myself with people to do that can teach me because now guess

1784
01:51:51.281 --> 01:51:54.140
what?
Learning is cool.
Yeah.

1785
01:51:54.170 --> 01:51:57.280
That's what happens when you don't have to do it anymore.
Right.
It's its own.

1786
01:51:57.281 --> 01:52:01.270
Your kid,
they force you into this school,
don't want to learn,

1787
01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:04.570
but then when you get out and you realize like,
oh,
this actually benefits me.

1788
01:52:04.571 --> 01:52:06.790
This make me a better person.
It makes me wiser.

1789
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:11.950
It's 100% the reality and it's weird how it happens,

1790
01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:17.110
but when you go,
oh my God,
learning and knowledge is power.

1791
01:52:17.710 --> 01:52:22.660
Fuck.
They used to tell me this when I was 10 yes,
10 11 years old.

1792
01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:26.710
I heard that shit all the time.
Now I finally get it.

1793
01:52:27.370 --> 01:52:27.671
Damn,

1794
01:52:27.671 --> 01:52:32.500
I'm about to be 40 he all his time to get the Goddamn code,

1795
01:52:33.010 --> 01:52:34.030
but I got it.
Yeah.

1796
01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:39.220
It hits you at a different time and when it does be excited about it,

1797
01:52:39.221 --> 01:52:44.200
man.
Excited.
I'm excited about with 50 years.

1798
01:52:44.930 --> 01:52:47.240
I'm just now getting the 40.
Do you read books?

1799
01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:51.320
I don't read a lot of books.
Do you listen to books on tape?

1800
01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:55.910
I have listened to books in our wireless to what?
Tony Robbins.
He's great.

1801
01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:58.190
Tony's uh,
uh,
uh,
like

1802
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:03.400
I like his approach to giving information.
Um,

1803
01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:06.170
I like his attitude in general.

1804
01:53:06.770 --> 01:53:09.230
I like podcasts.

1805
01:53:10.130 --> 01:53:14.780
I like things that are real and that are presented in front of me.

1806
01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:19.970
I like information that I can go to the source and,
and touch and talk.

1807
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:22.190
So for my,
if I'm reading a book,

1808
01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:26.390
it's a book that was recommended by such and such and the person that gave it to

1809
01:53:26.391 --> 01:53:27.770
me and after reading that book,

1810
01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:31.070
I learned more about the individual than I thought I already knew.

1811
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:35.330
And now I gained more.
Michelle Obama's book.
Great Book,

1812
01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:40.490
great fucking book.
I met her,
talked to her.

1813
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:46.310
I've been in the same rooms as seen her success.
What is her book gonna be about?

1814
01:53:46.570 --> 01:53:49.940
Mm.
Oh,
read a book.
Wow.

1815
01:53:51.710 --> 01:53:55.430
I get it.
I get why it's moving.
All the units that it's moving.

1816
01:53:56.150 --> 01:53:59.480
I get while women are reading his book and walking away feeling better,

1817
01:53:59.930 --> 01:54:04.720
feeling like they can't,
I get it.
Oh Wow.
Hmm.

1818
01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:10.280
Certain friends,
Dwayne Wade,
he wrote a book.
It's focused on being a father,

1819
01:54:10.281 --> 01:54:12.380
his road to becoming a better father.

1820
01:54:12.381 --> 01:54:14.780
What he went through with this kid's mother.

1821
01:54:15.090 --> 01:54:18.470
How you developed a relationship than a bond with his son's like nobody else.

1822
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:22.460
Wow.
Didn't know that.
D that's dope.

1823
01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:26.330
I love how you put it on page.
There's certain things that you just want to know.

1824
01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:30.110
Uh,
certain books help.

1825
01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:32.600
I understand why people read books.

1826
01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:37.460
I get what the information does.
You know,

1827
01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:42.490
the book that I'm working on now is all about the mental approach that you have

1828
01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:49.460
with life and people not understanding that your biggest enemy is you.

1829
01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:53.720
My whole book is about you battling yourself.

1830
01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:56.330
People don't understand is you against you.

1831
01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:01.970
The only person that gets in your way is you.
Nobody else is.
You know,

1832
01:55:01.971 --> 01:55:05.300
when you write a book like this,
and especially about something like this,

1833
01:55:05.301 --> 01:55:09.440
this is the way you've managed to navigate through life are,

1834
01:55:09.590 --> 01:55:13.400
do you do write it out in essays?
Do you,
do you,

1835
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:15.610
do you have like bullet points that you,
you,

1836
01:55:15.650 --> 01:55:18.740
you think about and then once you have those bullet points and you head and then

1837
01:55:18.741 --> 01:55:22.370
you ride on those out,
how do you do it?
I was showing you that on your phone.

1838
01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:27.230
It's all,
all voice notes and transcripts.

1839
01:55:27.290 --> 01:55:31.490
Okay.
So because of your time you don't have,

1840
01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:36.170
you don't have the,
the time to sit and actually write.

1841
01:55:36.710 --> 01:55:41.710
So you need somebody that you can talk to for hours,

1842
01:55:42.290 --> 01:55:46.820
hours,
hours on it.
Hey,
I need an hour block,

1843
01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:49.320
an hour for me.
I got some stuff we want to talk to you about.
Kev.

1844
01:55:49.321 --> 01:55:54.100
What was that all right.
Book title,
idea,
subtitle,
ideas.
My dedications,

1845
01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:57.480
my introductions.
Um,
within my introductions,

1846
01:55:57.630 --> 01:56:01.890
these all powerful paragraphs and things that I was just sad that a now

1847
01:56:01.891 --> 01:56:05.880
transcript,
I get to go back and read it.
Um,
let me see here.

1848
01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:11.670
There's no conversation at all.
Marie,
one of them.
Um,
no conversation or,

1849
01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:13.530
and that's what the Internet has allowed people to do.

1850
01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:18.480
Any of that does allow people to skip steps one through 30 is allow people to

1851
01:56:18.481 --> 01:56:23.250
jump straight to 100 fuck you got a job off.
Take them down.
You should be dead.

1852
01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:26.640
Oh God.
Fucking can't stand this.
Whatever.

1853
01:56:26.641 --> 01:56:30.840
The hate of the anger is when listen,
one,
listen.
Okay.

1854
01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:34.260
When I listen and I can change,
I'm not that guy.

1855
01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:39.330
We're doing these weird things now that people aren't taking the time to sit and

1856
01:56:39.331 --> 01:56:40.164
think through.

1857
01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:44.490
What I've understood is that what people are doing has nothing to do with me.

1858
01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:49.770
I should always be a step ahead because I'm thinking differently because I'm

1859
01:56:49.771 --> 01:56:51.180
thinking about myself.

1860
01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:55.440
Making myself better puts me in a position to make others better.

1861
01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:58.140
Be the example,
not the problem.

1862
01:56:58.770 --> 01:57:03.510
The best way to take away the problem is to alienate yourself from it.

1863
01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:07.290
These are just thoughts.
Ah,
it was fucking thoughts.

1864
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:08.990
I can go through and just read it.

1865
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000
This is a sort of just have these philosophies you your life and you just just

1866
01:57:14.071 --> 01:57:18.330
speak.
It was,
it does speak Dan,
so now this is all transcript.

1867
01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:21.180
Look along with this.
That's incredible.
This is all fucking transcript.

1868
01:57:21.181 --> 01:57:24.660
This is all.
So I'll just go back throughout the day and I've read it and I say,

1869
01:57:24.661 --> 01:57:28.560
this is great.
This makes sense.
This didn't let me reword this.

1870
01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:32.100
I mean make sure that it's all flowing together and at the end of the day,

1871
01:57:32.610 --> 01:57:36.300
what's my reason for the book?
My reason for the book is to make people better.

1872
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:40.800
My reason for the book is to make people understand.
Yeah,
we all agree.

1873
01:57:41.730 --> 01:57:43.320
We all should think that we're great.

1874
01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:46.110
There's no reason for you to not think that you're great.

1875
01:57:47.070 --> 01:57:49.980
If you don't think you're great,
ask yourself why?

1876
01:57:50.970 --> 01:57:55.970
Why don't you think the highest of yourself when you do people who have no,

1877
01:57:56.600 --> 01:58:00.570
you have no choice but to follow suit.
Hmm.
You got no choice but the pharmaceutic

1878
01:58:01.410 --> 01:58:03.600
<v 0>a lot of people,
their base it on their past.</v>

1879
01:58:03.690 --> 01:58:07.170
They base it on the life that they've experienced up until this moment makes you

1880
01:58:07.171 --> 01:58:10.440
better.
Yeah,
it does make a batch of bad.
Better makes you smarter.
Yeah.

1881
01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:14.010
Like you say it.
Yeah man.
That's what's interesting about it.

1882
01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:15.150
That's what's interesting about life.

1883
01:58:15.180 --> 01:58:18.540
You can hear a guy like you say that and then it changes your perspective and

1884
01:58:18.541 --> 01:58:21.390
then you'll go out and take action that you might not have taken before.

1885
01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:24.120
I had a five 85 on my sat confessions.

1886
01:58:25.170 --> 01:58:28.890
I didn't even take my confession and get you 400 for putting your name on a

1887
01:58:28.891 --> 01:58:33.540
paper.
It's true story.
Wow.
I guess a,
B,
a,
c,
a d.
A.
I did advocate Daba

1888
01:58:35.210 --> 01:58:39.480
true stories.
Swear to God.
My hand on my mother's grave,
a,
B,
a c,

1889
01:58:39.481 --> 01:58:42.070
a d eight all the way.
I didn't care

1890
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:45.640
<v 2>because it was a class trip that saved day.
I wanted to go.
Great adventure.</v>

1891
01:58:47.590 --> 01:58:50.770
I was told that not taking my sats seriously,

1892
01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:54.670
but prohibit me from furthering myself in life.

1893
01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:59.050
That's what I was told at the moment.
I said,
damn,
maybe I should have.

1894
01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:01.950
Maybe I should apply myself.
Maybe I shouldn't did different.

1895
01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:05.800
When I saw all my friends get their test scores back and they were static,

1896
01:59:06.190 --> 01:59:09.070
800 909 sixties everybody's going to college.

1897
01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:10.960
Fellow at the biggest idiot in the fucking world.

1898
01:59:11.890 --> 01:59:14.360
The biggest idiot in the fucking world because the same people that I want to

1899
01:59:14.361 --> 01:59:17.980
rush to go to great adventure with.
They had taken an sat the week before.

1900
01:59:18.730 --> 01:59:22.030
They already got their work done.
They did everything they were supposed to do.

1901
01:59:22.031 --> 01:59:23.740
So that moment of fun was real fun for them.

1902
01:59:24.460 --> 01:59:28.870
I was the only dumb ass that didn't prioritize and take care of my shit.

1903
01:59:29.650 --> 01:59:31.750
So I'm the only one going to community college.

1904
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:36.160
Everybody's else off the Villanova Temple University,
Drexel University.

1905
01:59:36.850 --> 01:59:39.820
God Damn,
I just got left behind.

1906
01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:43.330
Why didn't y'all tell me that y'all did it the week before?

1907
01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:47.230
How do I tell me that we was serious about the college shit?

1908
01:59:47.231 --> 01:59:51.070
Y'All ain't telling me y'all was trying to go to temple or Drexel.
All weight

1909
01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:56.140
is because my life isn't their life.

1910
01:59:56.141 --> 02:00:00.550
Then they're focused on themselves.
Wow.

1911
02:00:00.551 --> 02:00:04.250
That they're doing what they're supposed to do.
A Jack Ass.

1912
02:00:05.170 --> 02:00:08.710
Go sit by yourself and figure it out because this is where you should be less

1913
02:00:08.711 --> 02:00:09.544
than learn.

1914
02:00:10.090 --> 02:00:14.950
Any opportunity given should be taken serious from this point on because if not,

1915
02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:17.200
you can find yourself feeling just like this.

1916
02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:19.960
It's hard to get down on myself a fucking moment and learn from it.

1917
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:25.600
Learn from it.
Now if I got to take a Goddamn test,

1918
02:00:25.601 --> 02:00:28.180
you best believe I'm studying for that fun test cause I don't want to feel like

1919
02:00:28.181 --> 02:00:31.360
I'm the guy that didn't prepare.
No,

1920
02:00:31.361 --> 02:00:35.440
I got a story to tell my kids about what it feels like to be the kid in class

1921
02:00:35.441 --> 02:00:36.181
that didn't prepare it.

1922
02:00:36.181 --> 02:00:38.470
It's got the worst grade when they give all those grades back.

1923
02:00:39.130 --> 02:00:42.940
But because of my experience,
I don't look down on those moments.

1924
02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:46.570
You take those moms,
you make the best of them because they'd live lessons.

1925
02:00:46.770 --> 02:00:51.460
It's that simple.
You're saying it's positive,
but it's really just simplicity.

1926
02:00:51.461 --> 02:00:54.340
That's real drill.

1927
02:00:55.010 --> 02:00:58.730
<v 3>It's real and it's your life experience and it's your life's lessons 100% but</v>

1928
02:00:58.731 --> 02:01:01.520
the fact that a guy like you comes out and talks about it like that,

1929
02:01:01.521 --> 02:01:04.280
that's where it makes it really powerful cause it's not just something that you

1930
02:01:04.281 --> 02:01:07.700
learned from,
but now other people can learn from your past too.

1931
02:01:07.730 --> 02:01:10.310
That's what I'm hoping.
They'll look at themselves and they,

1932
02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:13.340
they realize like we all start from a different spot.

1933
02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:18.780
<v 2>You're not saying,
yeah,
this is why I'm so candid.
I'm so candid.</v>

1934
02:01:18.781 --> 02:01:20.850
I'm so open.
They're there.

1935
02:01:20.851 --> 02:01:24.500
There is no like guys,
I'm,

1936
02:01:24.501 --> 02:01:29.190
I'm fine with being an open book.
I'm fine with the good,
the bad,

1937
02:01:29.191 --> 02:01:31.470
the ugly.
I'm fine being flawed.

1938
02:01:32.190 --> 02:01:35.970
I'm fine with all the things that have happened to me that have been exposed.

1939
02:01:36.570 --> 02:01:41.420
I'm fine with it all.
I don't hide from it.
I don't run from it.

1940
02:01:42.530 --> 02:01:46.670
I don't,
I don't,
uh,
avoid any of it.
I'm fine.

1941
02:01:47.570 --> 02:01:50.930
It's all right.
It's a bed that I made for myself.

1942
02:01:50.931 --> 02:01:55.670
I happily lay in it and I'll be fine figuring it out.
Moving forward.

1943
02:01:56.430 --> 02:01:59.900
Sonos,
stop for nobody,
man.
Sundo fuck.
Stop.

1944
02:01:59.901 --> 02:02:01.460
Sign going to be up in the morning regardless.

1945
02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:05.370
As son is going to be up in the morning,
we,

1946
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:08.900
regardless of how I fucking feel and how depressed I am,

1947
02:02:08.901 --> 02:02:13.901
the sun is going to fucking Shannon in the morning and a night time to move on

1948
02:02:13.931 --> 02:02:16.130
and be there and you want to look up these days going to keep going by.

1949
02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:21.140
So do you let the days go by and look up and you waste wasted a year doing what?

1950
02:02:22.130 --> 02:02:25.610
Or do you just pick it up?
All right.
Well and figured out,

1951
02:02:25.611 --> 02:02:29.030
made some mistakes that life goes on.
We figure out life from this point.

1952
02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:31.310
I'm a life goes on type of guy.

1953
02:02:32.910 --> 02:02:37.720
<v 0>You're a bad motherfucker.
Kevin Hart.
Very,
very,
very inspirational and I'm,</v>

1954
02:02:37.721 --> 02:02:40.450
I'm really glad you came down here and talked about it.
Um,

1955
02:02:40.940 --> 02:02:42.870
<v 2>I'm more than glad.
I think</v>

1956
02:02:42.930 --> 02:02:46.500
<v 0>that it took too long actually.
And this is the first of a,</v>

1957
02:02:46.501 --> 02:02:49.590
of what will be many men.
I'm for sure.
I'm a fan too.

1958
02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.730
I just think what you're doing is not just inspirational in terms of like what

1959
02:02:53.731 --> 02:02:55.680
you've been able to achieve and who you are,

1960
02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:59.910
but also inspirational and how you're so dedicated to helping other people.

1961
02:02:59.911 --> 02:03:03.950
That means a lot to me.
It,
it's very,
it's very motivating.
It's very powerful.

1962
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:08.370
I want to,
I want all your listeners to know that is not,
um,
it's not the top.
No,

1963
02:03:08.430 --> 02:03:12.040
this is,
this is no way it could be you,
if you were doing that just for talk,

1964
02:03:12.041 --> 02:03:12.874
it'd be like listen,

1965
02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:16.840
just fake it and then become that guy because you know you're onto something.

1966
02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:20.850
If you could do that and just say it and dark web,

1967
02:03:20.851 --> 02:03:23.580
fucking forget about whatever it's fake or not.

1968
02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:29.310
You're on.
No,
I want you guys trust me.
You will be seeing more.

The financial fitness is real artist relationship with chase and now it's just

1970
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:37.950
making sure you put me in a position to give the information that I have and to

1971
02:03:37.951 --> 02:03:40.510
the people that have really needed,
that's the priority.
Uh,

1972
02:03:40.511 --> 02:03:43.650
I will be sending more kids to college this year.
Um,

1973
02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:48.360
shout out to Tony Robins who's a matching my donation.
So you know,

1974
02:03:48.361 --> 02:03:53.361
I think I'm going to end up probably probably having about a good million to 1.5

1975
02:03:53.850 --> 02:03:58.200
where we take and we just dedicate that money and we just provide free
education.

1976
02:03:58.690 --> 02:04:03.120
You NCF helps me as well.
That's a priority.
Like I said,

1977

Irresponsible on Netflix filming,

1980
02:04:14.150 --> 02:04:16.320
We were about to come out with that and Christmas.
