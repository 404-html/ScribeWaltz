1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.000
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience watching and I'm gonna say this in.</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Then the idea's going to be there.</v>

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>All the business guys take off their jackets.</v>

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>You know they have the shirt and ties and they throw him over the back of their</v>

5
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:10.734
<v Speaker 1>chairs.</v>

6
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm a new invent suit.</v>

7
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Jackets that aren't real ones.</v>

8
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>They just cover the back of your chair.</v>

9
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.420
<v Speaker 1>So you see that as a piece of year suit,</v>

10
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to wear the jacket.</v>

11
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

12
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:22.180
<v Speaker 1>You got to tackle brilliant,</v>

13
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 1>brilliant idea.</v>

14
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:25.420
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about signage.</v>

15
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Jackets are never a good idea.</v>

16
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:27.061
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

17
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:27.820
<v Speaker 1>half run.</v>

18
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>They're going to go in the back conference room yourself too long.</v>

19
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:35.931
<v Speaker 1>Virtual fist pump you jackets that are going to go on the back of,</v>

20
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>because here's the thing,</v>

21
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:37.711
<v Speaker 1>when you do those,</v>

22
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to wear dress pants because they can't it.</v>

23
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>They're like newscasters.</v>

24
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>So the new look,</v>

25
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>you can go board shorts,</v>

26
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.110
<v Speaker 1>flip flops,</v>

27
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>maybe a nice shirt with a tie,</v>

28
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 1>fake jacket cover over the thing.</v>

29
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>You look like you're wearing a suit and you've got probably talent,</v>

30
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>brain dog dies or a NASA.</v>

31
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning of the show brain doctor,</v>

32
00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>you need to go see one telling you you're going to,</v>

33
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see it.</v>

34
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>You're all gonna throw it out there.</v>

35
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>John Heffron I'd be willing to bet you an insane amount of money.</v>

36
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>That fake jackets that you put on the back of your study will exempt to catch on</v>

37
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.651
<v Speaker 1>because he will exist.</v>

38
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'll create them.</v>

39
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>You will.</v>

40
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 1>They will exist and they will be a money pit of disastrous proportions for I</v>

41
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>need a sanction as your direct message.</v>

42
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:19.351
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

43
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I need a seamstress.</v>

44
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.120
<v Speaker 1>What is it like dealing with those people in that world and doing like squeaky</v>

45
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 1>clean comedy only and not being able to take any chances up there or go into any</v>

46
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>weird directions.</v>

47
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.723
<v Speaker 1>What does that like?</v>

48
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.430
<v Speaker 1>I've always done that type of comedy so it's not weird you your Carmoney has,</v>

49
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>

50
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm an adult but I'm not,</v>

51
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't get ever super grand.</v>

53
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

54
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 1>I believe you can turn a clean bit dirty,</v>

55
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>just buy things then vice versa.</v>

56
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 1>But yet you are one of the most perverted people I've ever met my wife up with</v>

57
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:49.920
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

58
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Plus I think it's weird when you have jobs that then affect you.</v>

59
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Like when I used to do morning radio with Bonaduce,</v>

60
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.970
<v Speaker 1>we are on a soccer mom station.</v>

61
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>You guys run a soccer mom station.</v>

62
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.593
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

63
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 1>well Danny tried to get in a fight at a matchbox 20 concert.</v>

64
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.560
<v Speaker 1>So that shows you what kind of enhancing,</v>

65
00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:10.011
<v Speaker 1>try match.</v>

66
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:11.750
<v Speaker 1>But in a fight and a matchbox,</v>

67
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.683
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

68
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.621
<v Speaker 1>it was a great,</v>

69
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>he took off his shirt and was going to fight the entire row.</v>

70
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>J J at Pine Knob.</v>

71
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Why would the shirt off?</v>

72
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Because he cleaned the bathroom.</v>

73
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>I think this is back when Danny partied.</v>

74
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I think Danny met up with the listener and the disappeared.</v>

75
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

76
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.831
<v Speaker 1>whatever happened.</v>

77
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>So he came back in an altered state?</v>

78
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

79
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.190
<v Speaker 1>he was never that type of guy liquor.</v>

80
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 1>I think we resigned and he's talking,</v>

81
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about this story.</v>

82
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:39.111
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not thinking of,</v>

83
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>but it was that date rape drug.</v>

84
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:40.781
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

85
00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Everything he did GHB.</v>

86
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

87
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

88
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.381
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

89
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:44.214
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

90
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

91
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.630
<v Speaker 1>but Danny scar tissue,</v>

92
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 1>he did admit to all this stuff.</v>

93
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that guy,</v>

94
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.971
<v Speaker 1>but so he did.</v>

95
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>So then he came out crazy.</v>

96
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Did you say Danny is scar tissue?</v>

97
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.871
<v Speaker 1>His whole body is,</v>

98
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:54.450
<v Speaker 1>or there's no way you can be alive with all the stuff that he's done.</v>

99
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

100
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.970
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you,</v>

101
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.970
<v Speaker 1>you have to be totally embalmed.</v>

102
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.150
<v Speaker 1>What did they do that with frogs?</v>

103
00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.550
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

104
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>the body body's preserved.</v>

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>that's his entire body.</v>

110
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

111

115
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.503
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with him?</v>

116
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>He's just done so much stuff to his body.</v>

117
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>What was it like working with that guy?</v>

<v Speaker 1>26.</v>

148
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Why would you ever want to sleep then you go radio bar appearances,</v>

149
00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 1>like I was that guy movie premieres,</v>

151
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>but he got paid a lot of money.</v>

152
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>How crazy was daddy?</v>

153
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

154
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>beyond crazy?</v>

155
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Because the thing with Danny as you never knew which guy you were going to get.</v>

156
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 1>You can have a guy that you work with that's a consistent ass,</v>

157
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>but at least then you know how to tip toe.</v>

158
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.733
<v Speaker 1>Other Times,</v>

159
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

160
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>you'll be the coolest human being you've ever met.</v>

161
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 1>And then you come in the next day and you'd go,</v>

162
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 1>he's going to literally slit my throat.</v>

163
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>The only advantage,</v>

164
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean did it.</v>

165
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.321
<v Speaker 1>Now we're,</v>

166
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:28.080
<v Speaker 1>we're really good friends and at first he,</v>

167
00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:29.050
<v Speaker 1>he hated me.</v>

168
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to hate you.</v>

169
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

170
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

171
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.990
<v Speaker 1>I never did radio before I met him.</v>

172
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>I was just a comic round town and I didn't know how to talk to that person.</v>

173
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>It's try having a conversation with him.</v>

174
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:40.450
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>

175
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>So imagine being a 22 year old kid,</v>

176
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

177
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:44.120
<v Speaker 1>David [inaudible].</v>

179
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

180
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.771
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

181
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 1>but one time I,</v>

182
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't have my rhythm.</v>

184
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't know.</v>

185
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.760
<v Speaker 1>So he hated you because,</v>

186
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

187
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.943
<v Speaker 1>hated me.</v>

188
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Hated working with you.</v>

189
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Hated just,</v>

190
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.913
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

191
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

192
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.300
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to work with you.</v>

193
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to know why did we fired?</v>

194
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I just moved back from Los Angeles.</v>

195
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 1>So I moved to from Detroit to Los Angeles and then got that job and move back to</v>

196
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Detroit and then got fired maybe three or four weeks later.</v>

197
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 1>And then did he get you fired?</v>

198
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

199
00:05:10.271 --> 00:05:10.551
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

200
00:05:10.551 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 1>he got me fired and then we went to Chicago together.</v>

201
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.280
<v Speaker 1>It was odd for some weird thing.</v>

202
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.530
<v Speaker 1>And then we,</v>

203
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>he didn't suddenly liked me and then,</v>

204
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 1>then I was on the shelf.</v>

205
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.770
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

206
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

207
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 1>We did a radio show together for some reason.</v>

208
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Why we were doing it in Chicago.</v>

209
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Something clicked where he's like,</v>

210
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.141
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 1>He did that for a couple months and then,</v>

251
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

252
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:32.570

253
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>you know where they can ISD and at where he could do it in thing.</v>

254
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 1>But he was doing that every day is insane.</v>

<v Speaker 1>40 F yeah.</v>

261
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.300

262
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:49.160
<v Speaker 1>and forth and then do his radio show.</v>

266
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.201
<v Speaker 1>So he got,</v>

267
00:06:55.201 --> 00:06:56.390
<v Speaker 1>had to be on drugs to do that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So I was fired,</v>

269
00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:58.880

270
00:06:58.881 --> 00:06:59.211
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

271
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they did that.</v>

304
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.450

305
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

306

313
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Was this because why were they giving you a pay cut?</v>

314
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.243
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>

315
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.661
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

316
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:48.321
<v Speaker 1>because I was,</v>

317
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I had no management or anything and they're a huge corporation.</v>

318
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.030
<v Speaker 1>this huge radio guy,</v>

322
00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Dick Curtin in Detroit,</v>

323
00:07:57.411 --> 00:08:01.040
<v Speaker 1>was leaving the radio station and he suggested to that management,</v>

324
00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:02.450
<v Speaker 1>you need to bring this Heprin kid in.</v>

325
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:02.991
<v Speaker 1>Keep in mind,</v>

326
00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm just starting college,</v>

327
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:04.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

328
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:06.440
<v Speaker 1>so then they go and you know,</v>

329
00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Dick knows your most standup comedian.</v>

330
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:08.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

331
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:11.900
<v Speaker 1>And it was on a show and he was probably the most famous radio guy in Detroit.</v>

332
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.480
<v Speaker 1>So they hired me just because of that and put me with Danny.</v>

333
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.363
<v Speaker 1>But Danny,</v>

334
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.930
<v Speaker 1>how crazy.</v>

335
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.500
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] he's the guy who,</v>

336
00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:19.334
<v Speaker 1>and I've told him,</v>

337
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 1>well anyway,</v>

338
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.650
<v Speaker 1>he's the one who got me into fighting.</v>

339
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.903
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

340
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.040
<v Speaker 1>he was really in the boxing and stuff.</v>

341
00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:29.340
<v Speaker 1>So then what he did was he came to the radio station and he had like headgear</v>

342
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.313
<v Speaker 1>cups,</v>

343
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.330
<v Speaker 1>a boxing gloves and says,</v>

344
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

345
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm friends with Jackie Callan,</v>

346
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.870
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go to her place and we're going to,</v>

347
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.670
<v Speaker 1>I want you to learn to box so I have somebody to spar with.</v>

348
00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:42.590
<v Speaker 1>So he bought me all my appointments.</v>

349
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.210
<v Speaker 1>He bought me all my equipment,</v>

350
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Speaker 1>got me crazy coaches and goes after it and I'm going to take you out of box.</v>

351
00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:48.734
<v Speaker 1>So I have somebody to,</v>

352
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.210
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to spar everyday from,</v>

353
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.040
<v Speaker 1>from 12 to 12 to three.</v>

354
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.053
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

355
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>So long time to get good at boxing kid,</v>

356
00:08:54.891 --> 00:08:55.621
<v Speaker 1>just start sparring.</v>

357
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Someone had been doing it forever.</v>

358
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

359
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.051
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

360
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:00.750
<v Speaker 1>so I got the stuff and then um,</v>

361
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 1>then me and Danny fought and I would never been more afraid of my entire life.</v>

362
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

363
00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.890
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing about fighting.</v>

364
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:09.030
<v Speaker 1>You can be a really good,</v>

365
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:09.751
<v Speaker 1>you go to class,</v>

366
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 1>you want to think,</v>

367
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.250
<v Speaker 1>but you have to have that thing in you that makes you want to kill people,</v>

368
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>which I've never had.</v>

369
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.940
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy fighting and I learned learning stuff,</v>

370
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:19.330
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have that morale.</v>

371
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.573
<v Speaker 1>There's that thing.</v>

372
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Danny is a complete psycho.</v>

373
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.630
<v Speaker 1>He completely has that thing and we'll kill you.</v>

374
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Then that's when that shortly after,</v>

375
00:09:27.121 --> 00:09:28.620
<v Speaker 1>that's when he gave me a concussion.</v>

376
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Hit me right in the back of the head,</v>

377
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

378
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.370

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:34.740
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

398
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 1>This was in the nineties when people bought DVD players.</v>

399
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.090
<v Speaker 1>So I actually went backwards in technology.</v>
