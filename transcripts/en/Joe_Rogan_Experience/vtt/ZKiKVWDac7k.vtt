1
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.940
Do I look to you?
Look fantastic.
You look great.
Beautiful.

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.550
All right.
Feel better.
All downhill from here.
Got Joe to think I'm pretty,

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.580
you're alive.
Hey,
what's up?
How are you?
I'm good.

4
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:22.440
I'm,
I'm insecure.
I'm very insecure.
I'm very,
I want you to like me,

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.380
but you know already like,
you know,
you're going to read.

6
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:28.680
You're very hard to read.
Shut up.
Yes.
When you're sober,
you're hard to read.

7
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.330
When I'm sober,
wanting to get high,
when I'm high,
I'm hard to read.

8
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.100
No sober me to read.
Or at least you just like people more.
I was like,
everybody,

9
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.070
here's the thing about you that you don't know about with our relationship.

10
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.130
When I easy,

11
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.650
when I know you did just arch your back there for us,
like different.

12
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.250
Um,
when I started doing standup,

13
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.380
you were like this very mythical,
um,

14
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.340
hero at the comedy store.

15
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.960
I came into the comedy store when you and Carlos had your big,

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.660
uh,
saga.
Oh,

17
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:09.510
so you had just like your exodus,

18
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:13.410
you're very ceremonious or unceremonious rather exodus when the comedy store was

19
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:15.450
happening.
So I never really met you,

20
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.780
but you were like this deity at the comedy store.

21
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.380
Oh,
well then no.
Do you want to weigh in on that?

22
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.240
You were there and going there for,
so I never really knew you.

23
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:29.890
Like I feel like so many other comedians that I admire,

24
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.040
I at least have had some facetime with and you,

25
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:36.120
I only sort of started knowing and last year we met,

26
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:40.170
met at the laugh factory.
True.
But I'd seen you a bunch of times and I'd like to,

27
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.550
yeah.
But we had no vibe.
We never told me have since then.
That's true.

28
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:49.551
But I'm just saying because I have nine years of you being this sort of very

29
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.650
elusive,
you know,

30
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.340
big foot like I never quite knew if you really existed.

31
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.340
It's weird when people have perceptions of you outside of you and yellow then.

32
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.800
Yep.
It's weird when you meet someone perception then when you're like,
oh,

33
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:08.530
I like them.
I didn't think I did.
Yeah,
that happens.
Well,

34
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.830
I think a lot of it is it becomes a Rorschach test,
right?

35
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:13.590
If it comes like my projections onto you and my insecurities,

36
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:16.380
like if I see you and you don't give me what I need to feel secure,
I'm like,

37
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:18.830
he hates,
he doesn't like me.
I'm just didn't.
I had a friend,

38
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.740
a friend tell me something about a celebrity that they met and they were like,

39
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.690
yeah,
I'm at all.
And when I said a hard one,
but he's a fucking Dick,
you know,

40
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:30.020
you didn't even talk back to me.
I'll go,
okay.
Yeah.
You just said hi to them.
Yeah.

41
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.090
That's it.
And all sudden he's a dick.
Oh,
you anything.
Yeah.

42
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.050
It's like you have this idea of what someone is and then based on a limited

43
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:40.880
interaction,
you create a narrative.
You know?
I know that when people,
um,

44
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.910
this is going to sound like,

45
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:45.120
if I can do person bloviating about people that recognize them,

46
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:48.150
but when someone does get to use that word,
it's a good word.

47
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:51.090
I've never used that in my life.
It's a good word because it does fit.

48
00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:54.900
Sometimes I ramble and I want you to reign me in if I start getting boring or

49
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:59.550
being redundant.
And bloviating,
but when someone comes up to,
uh,

50
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.500
like at the airport and he's like,
Hi Whitney.
Like I instantly,

51
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.910
sometimes I have to say that I'm like,

52
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.700
I just feel like I cannot give you what you need right now.
Like,

53
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:10.180
what you need from me.
I can't give you,
like,
I can take a picture with you,

54
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:11.020
but I can't,

55
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.060
there's no way you're going to walk away from this exchange feeling good about

56
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:18.250
this.
She was this,
she was this,
you know,

57
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:21.550
I get very insecure that I can't deliver what someone needs from a person.

58
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:23.490
They know where the guy,

59
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.420
I'll never forget this because I didn't know this guy at all.
And uh,

60
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.750
it was after show,
you know,
I say hi to people,
you know,
the whole thing.

61
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:34.450
Take pictures.
And then he goes,
hey man,

62
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.120
I'm dating this girl and she's about to have a baby.
Um,

63
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.370
what do you think I should do?
Like what?
I go,
I don't,

64
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:45.240
what am I supposed to tell you?
Have you seen the movie,
the staircase?

65
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.710
A staircase,
the staircase?
You haven't seen the staircase.

66
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:52.570
The documentary is that when he throws her downstairs,

67
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.470
two women are found at the bottom of the staircase.
It's actually,

68
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.460
it's what people think the jinx is.
It's was a Sundance channel documentary.

69
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:03.760
It was like 12 part documentary series.
It's phenomenal.
You'll love it.

70
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.270
Really 12 yes,
12 parts.

71
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.660
I don't want to give away too much if you guys have seen it.
Um,
uh,

72
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.040
tweet Joe of what your thoughts are on it and let's all convince him to dedicate

73
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:17.830
12 hours of his life.
Because I am fascinated.
Speaking of Warshak test,

74
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:21.910
I'm fascinated whether you think he's guilty or not because usually it is all,

75
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.780
um,
whether someone thinks it's guilty or not says more about them than it does

76
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:29.530
about the case really.
Because again,
we projected her 12 parts.
It's a lot of,

77
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:34.300
I know,
that's what I said.
I made the mistake of only downloading one at a time.

78
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.490
I watched six and my first sitting,

79
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.810
it's that addictive half hour,
hour,
hour.
I promise you,

80
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.190
I promise you,
I will bet you you have a lot more money than me,

81
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:46.810
so maybe we shouldn't do this.
Um,

82
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.630
I will bet you any amount of money that you'll watch it in two days.

83
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.020
That's not going to happen.
It made me want to quit writing because I was like,

84
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.570
I will never be able to write something that's compelling is this true life

85
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:01.450
thing.
Wow.
Phenomenal.
The staircase.

86
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.870
Why wouldn't you just be inspired to write because you want to quit.

87
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.010
That's the fundamental difference between me and you just reared its ugly head.

88
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.480
I'm a quitter and you are not.
You're not a quitter.
That's what,
that's not true,

89
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:17.320
but you're a hustler.
I'm a hus.
Yes.
People say that a lot and I never know.

90
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.080
I never know if it's an insult at all and in my estimation are mine.

91
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.570
The way I'm defining it is you,
you're always working.
You know,

92
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:29.080
when we think maybe the difference between the similarity between me and you,

93
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.400
I grew up playing sports and you learn,
I think a lot of comedians don't.

94
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:34.660
You learned the harder you work,

95
00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:37.870
the better you get and you get that sort of mentality that like,

96
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.010
you know what sport?
I played basketball really seriously,
blah,

97
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.620
sprinting,
a lot of running around and just like the,
yeah,
I,
you know,

98
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:50.890
this acid is pretty new.
Actually.
I didn't have,
I seen you didn't,

99
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:53.520
you didn't know me six years ago when I was like anorexic,

100
00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.230
anorexic.
Yeah.
I use,
I don't want to be clinically throw that term around,

101
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:02.750
but I was like,
um,
I was like a hundred pounds.

102
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.990
I was when I was doing the show with Pr.
You're ready Chris on NBC.

103
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.590
I was like UB zero.
Yeah.
And I had a lot of eating disorders in college,

104
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.050
which is why I had to stop playing sports.
Really?
Yeah.

105
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.470
Eating disorders made you stop playing sports.
I had to choose.

106
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:18.440
So I was really serious.
Basketball,
played Aau.
I played in Europe,

107
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:22.520
like super psycho about it.
And then I started modeling just for money,

108
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:26.540
not really fancy modeling,
don't believe Wikipedia.
Um,
and uh,

109
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.260
I was sort of starving myself for modeling and starving yourself and playing

110
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:32.720
basketball for hours a day.
I don't go well together,

111
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.010
so I had to sort of give up basketball.
Wow.
So you went with that over food?

112
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.180
Yes.
Yes.
Why did you do that?
Well,

113
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.650
modeling was paying my bills.
It was the way I was raised was,
um,

114
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.510
you know,
your appearance was very valued.
My mom,

115
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:53.420
I now realize as an adult in retrospect,

116
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:57.380
had an eating disorder and being thin was very valued in our home.

117
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.230
The messages I heard where my mom,
who was very,
you know,

118
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.180
skinny was I have to lose five pounds.

119
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:04.670
I still don't lose that fat at any one time.
Some will compliment her.

120
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:07.130
She'd be like,
no,
I'm at,
I'm so fat right now.
Like,
those are just,

121
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:11.240
that's how I was.
We don't realize the impact that those messages have on kids.

122
00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:12.980
Something that we just think it's a flippant comment.

123
00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:16.100
I need to lose five pounds for me.
Like I was like,
oh,
she's a size zero,

124
00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:17.450
but she still needs to lose five pounds.

125
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:19.490
That's what women are supposed to look like and how they're supposed to,

126
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.390
you know,
that just morphea was ingrained in me very young.
Um,

127
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.120
and there was a sort of culture of perfectionism.
Uh,
uh,

128
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.710
where I grew up in my household because I had,
was not,
um,

129
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.230
I was neglected quite a bit and it's a natural sort of reaction for kids to have

130
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:41.090
perfectionism as a result of that.
So yeah,
because you think,
you know,

131
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.900
you can't,

132
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.310
the children can't understand that their parents have flaws because it would be,

133
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.210
you know,
just too traumatic to their psyche.

134
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.420
So we think parents are perfect.
If I'm not getting attention,
that must be,

135
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:56.870
something's wrong with me,
so I need to work harder,
be prettier or thinner,

136
00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.210
a more successful,
achieve more,

137
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.740
which I think is where a lot of my achievements stuff to try to get your parents

138
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:08.210
to pay attention to,
or a kid that's when it started is if I'm just perfect,

139
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.750
I'll get this attention from these people who weren't capable of giving it to
me.

140
00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:15.470
And then it sorta started manifesting in other ways.
Uh,
as an adult,

141
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.270
I think I had a very similar thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.

142
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.050
It was definitely neglected as a child,

143
00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:25.550
but I think that I sought it out from other people,
not necessarily frame.

144
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.480
Yeah.
Well,
that's what I,
you know,
and,
and similarly,
which is I think why I had,

145
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.500
and I'm in Alanon so I'm,
I'm in recovery for this,

146
00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:36.260
but people pleasing Alanon is like,
um,

147
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.050
if you had any kind of alcoholism in your home growing up,

148
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.850
which is not necessarily like I did have an alcoholic parent and I have a,

149
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:48.500
a drug addict sibling,
but alcoholism,
um,
you know,

150
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.770
for alcoholism to be present,
alcohol doesn't necessarily need to be present.

151
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:54.500
So it could still be signified by,
um,
compulsive behavior.

152
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:58.330
Workaholism a codependent relationship and addictive relationship among your

153
00:08:58.331 --> 00:09:02.460
parents,
uh,
gambling,
sex,
food,
all that sort of stuff.

154
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.510
Anything that's a down on stand for Allen on his,
um,

155
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.700
that's actually a really good question.
I do ACA,

156
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:10.590
which is adult child of alcoholics.

157
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.170
Alanon is more for like if you're married to an alcoholic,

158
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:14.550
if you have a kid who's an alcoholic,

159
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:18.450
like because addiction is a family disease and it affects everybody.

160
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.620
So I am,

161
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.940
I know it's such a fucking pain in the ass in that regard.

162
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.970
It's a very sort of pernicious disease because sometimes good word pernicious is

163
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:33.720
a good one because it's,
um,
we're live,

164
00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:38.010
I've got to pull out all the stops and we can't fix this in post.
Um,

165
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.130
is that,
uh,
it sometimes alcoholism affects the people not drinking the most.

166
00:09:43.131 --> 00:09:47.250
So I wasn't drinking,
growing up,
but I,
uh,
because of here's another one,

167
00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:51.600
how insidious alcoholism is.
I was acting like an alcoholic.

168
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.720
I just wasn't drinking.
So I was like arrogant and developed an ego of like,

169
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:58.290
I'm the angel in the house.
Everyone else is an asshole.
I'm awesome.

170
00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:03.240
But I was still manipulating,
lying,
managing,
controlling,
you know,

171
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.840
and codependence alcoholics are addicted to alcohol.

172
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:10.620
Codependence are addicted to alcoholics.
So I,
as a result,

173
00:10:10.621 --> 00:10:13.430
I'm dating alcoholics.
I'm dating guys who are literate,

174
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.940
people who need to get rescued.

175
00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.570
A saved you dated guys who were illiterate.

176
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.340
I dated one guy who couldn't read,
couldn't really smell,

177
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.810
kind of lots of,
um,
lots of auto correcting.

178
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:33.660
Uh,
yeah.
Hey,
are you a basketball later?
What?
Um,

179
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.770
so,
uh,
yes,
I did.
I did go through that.
I did a lot of like alcoholics,

180
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:38.880
needy people,

181
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.190
troubled people who'd always date girls that were really,
really fucked up.

182
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.920
Just
stag.
Fiona Apple.

183
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.540
Well that's the best one ever day.
Oh,
but I did same thing.
Bam.

184
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.740
He calls him vampires.
Oh,
he had some bad ones,

185
00:10:55.741 --> 00:10:57.420
but so it's recreating your childhood circumstances.

186
00:10:57.421 --> 00:11:00.900
So I was the caretaker as a child.
Right.
You know,
I would put my mom too bad.

187
00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:01.800
I would cook dinner.

188
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:05.550
I was always the one fixing things and trying to stop fights because I was,

189
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.240
you know,
based on my mom basically told me I was like a mistake.
I was born,

190
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.370
no one planned me.
And when he told you that?
Yeah.
Jesus.
Yeah.
It wasn't good.

191
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:18.600
It wasn't the,
the um,
our shine,
our shining moment as a family.

192
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.810
When I don't send money,
I get reminded money to your mom.
Yeah,

193
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:28.170
yeah.
Yes.
It's dark fairy malls.

194
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:30.360
Chris Rock said in the hallway,
the comedy store one night,

195
00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:33.570
I think you were actually probably there.
Uh,
he said,
um,

196
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:35.220
when you give money to people,

197
00:11:35.221 --> 00:11:37.200
it's only a matter of time before they start hating you,

198
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.870
because then they start resenting you for supporting them and sort of robbing

199
00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:45.760
them of their own dignity.
And then if you have any kind of boundaries there,

200
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.090
all of a sudden like,
oh,
we'll just,
because you give me money,

201
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:51.960
you think you can talk to me that way.
And it's like,
well,
no,
I'm just like,

202
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.190
you have self respect.

203
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.570
<v 1>It's it,
it seems to me that the people that need money always need money.</v>

204
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.430
Like you,
you,
when you give the money,
it's not really helping them.
It's enabling.

205
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.090
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean there's some people that just need money.
I mean,

206
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:10.810
I've had friends who just needed money.
Yes.
Someone wrong transmission broke.

207
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:15.190
Fuck.
You know,
that's one thing.
But this,
the people that always need money.
Yeah.

208
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.990
They just,
you can't fix that hole.
That hole is just,
they'd come back to,
oh,

209
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:23.590
it turns out we were late with the payment and now there's interest in this and

210
00:12:23.591 --> 00:12:26.770
that.
And so do you think that,
okay.
And then there's,

211
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.640
we just had an issue with Bubba Bubba and like,
Oh fucking Christ,

212
00:12:30.641 --> 00:12:31.690
this doesn't end.
Does it?
Yeah.

213
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.950
<v 0>And so,
uh,
and it's interesting.</v>

214
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.630
I've had to work really hard on the parameters of when I can give money,

215
00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:37.464
when I can't,

216
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.970
my system now is basically to only pay bills directly cause that way.

217
00:12:41.971 --> 00:12:44.670
I know you do this all the time.
So this is an all the time thing.

218
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.070
I am cash burner Gel.

219
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:53.430
They being hemorrhaged hemorrhaging money through my family.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah,

220
00:12:53.431 --> 00:12:56.250
because I didn't grow up in an environment.
No one had health insurance.

221
00:12:56.251 --> 00:12:59.520
No one went to the doctor.
So now,
you know,
both my parents had strokes.

222
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.110
Nursing facilities are crate and no insurance,
like the whole deal.
So it's been,

223
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.770
but it's,
it's,
you know,
you talked about me working hard.

224
00:13:07.771 --> 00:13:10.950
I worked hard initially because I needed,
you know,
I didn't have a choice,

225
00:13:10.951 --> 00:13:14.640
I didn't have money and now I still have to work hard to sort of pay for all

226
00:13:14.641 --> 00:13:18.060
these other things,
which I think maybe in some ways keeping me,
you know,

227
00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.690
I'm motivated because I'm never going to get ahead.
I'm never going to be,

228
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.490
you're very aware of the solvent.

229
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:28.370
<v 1>You might be like kind of frantic and all over the place and motivated and you</v>

230
00:13:28.371 --> 00:13:33.230
know,
you give all this frantic a little bit,
but in a good way.
How so powerful.

231
00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.730
You've got like a lot of really?
Yeah.
I feel like that's off.
It's an armor.
I'm a,

232
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.630
it is,
it's not like a negative thing,
but it's like,
wow,

233
00:13:41.631 --> 00:13:45.680
that girl is getting shit done.
You know,
when I say frantic,

234
00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.250
maybe that's not the word.
Maybe the word is,
um,
pretty kinetic.
Yes.

235
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.080
Fabulous.
There's a lot of good ones,
but you know,
you're,

236
00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:01.070
you're not stagnant.
You know,
you're,
you're constantly in motion.

237
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.830
<v 0>Well that is a,
uh,
yes.
I define it.</v>

238
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.970
<v 1>You texted,
sorry to interrupt with what you texted me.
Like,</v>

239
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:11.350
here's a perfect example though.
I'm doing a documentary on head trauma.

240
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.360
What,
what the fuck?
I mean,
I know she's touring,

241
00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:18.160
you're in the middle of doing an HBO special.

242
00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:21.310
You've always got some shit going on.
Your,
you've always got these projects.

243
00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:24.220
Then you're like,
I'm directing a documentary on head trauma.
I'm like,
what?

244
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.780
What was violence?
Violence.
You wanted to talk about violence and just like,
Whoa,

245
00:14:28.781 --> 00:14:30.760
what does this fucking chick is crazy.

246
00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:36.160
<v 0>I,
um,
yes,
I am a,
I mean it is a literal disease.</v>

247
00:14:36.161 --> 00:14:39.520
I do have workoholism which means you define yourself through productivity.

248
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.220
And that's how we,

249
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.620
my self esteem is derived essentially through what I'm able to make.

250
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.020
So as you're so aware of all this,
well yeah,

251
00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:50.830
I'm in pretty hardcore a recovery for it.
So you know,

252
00:14:50.831 --> 00:14:54.680
I am an Alanon.
I do EMDR.
I'm in trauma therapy,

253
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:57.920
so I'm addicted to therapy.
I,
you know,
what,
I wish,

254
00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:00.590
I wish that I could actually find a healthy addiction.

255
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.890
I've found a lucrative addiction work as I was somewhat of a lucrative
addiction,

256
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:04.933
but um,

257
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:09.470
I'm definitely addicted to waking up and being conscious and self aware.

258
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:09.861
You know,

259
00:15:09.861 --> 00:15:14.861
like that's something that appeals to me and I wasn't in my twenties but again,

260
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:18.980
like we were just talking about someone earlier being being a mess isn't cute in

261
00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:23.120
your thirties and forties being asleep and unconscious and just being a

262
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.190
disaster.
It's just not cute anymore.

263
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:30.170
There's something about lazy people in their twenties that I find adorable.
Yeah.

264
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.770
But when I see a lazy can you turn 30 cute,

265
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:38.300
41 of 46 year old lazy guy.
Nope.
You didn't do that yet.
No.

266
00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:41.690
I got to get to it.
What?
And also as a girl,
I mean this is,

267
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.190
I mean guys have the stigma too,

268
00:15:43.191 --> 00:15:45.500
but as a girl like you can be crazy and you're 20 minutes,

269
00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:49.370
you can't be crazy in your thirties it's not sexy.
That's not true at all.
Really.

270
00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:55.500
Yeah.
Long as you don't show up at someone's house and break windows.
Yeah.

271
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.950
Those days are over.
Those days are really fast.
You know?

272
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.910
It's like what kind of crazy?

273
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.720
My kids aren't big enough to behave like that and get away with it.

274
00:16:04.721 --> 00:16:09.470
Unfortunately.
That's not really,
like,

275
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:13.520
that doesn't really help.
Yeah.
You can get away with,

276
00:16:13.521 --> 00:16:15.950
you can either get away with her.
You can't like tits.
Don't ever that,

277
00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:20.180
never that tipping point.
Really.
I don't think so.
I just feel like I'm,

278
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:25.040
as a woman,
you're already,
anything you do.
People want to call you crazy.
And,

279
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:29.660
uh,
even if you just talk sanely at a little too high,
but decibel level,

280
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.590
um,

281
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:35.030
and people are so quick to call us crazy anyway that I don't want to actually be

282
00:16:35.031 --> 00:16:39.050
crazy.
That's interesting because guys will never have to worry about that.

283
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.110
They don't have to worry about the idea that you're too ambitious or that you're

284
00:16:42.111 --> 00:16:47.030
too forceful if you don't like it.
No.
But for a man,
a man,

285
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:51.380
no,
no,
no,
no.
That guy before,
he's decisive.
He's an Alpha.

286
00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:55.550
He's got his shit together.
It's a turn on.
And then for a girl to be like that,

287
00:16:55.551 --> 00:16:59.360
it's like she's crazy.
She mega bitch,
pms psycho.

288
00:16:59.361 --> 00:17:03.410
She's a psycho.
She's stalking me.
It's like,
no,
I just,

289
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.580
I like you.
Yeah.

290
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:09.620
Or like I need to make plans because I have to schedule my flight.

291
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:13.130
Are we hanging out or not?
She still stalking me like,
okay,

292
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:16.490
am I stalking?
You know,
you think that that's a power move though,

293
00:17:16.491 --> 00:17:20.360
that people do that to try to like make you feel unsecure saying something like

294
00:17:20.361 --> 00:17:24.530
you're stalking them or saying,
you know,
like when people act like that now,

295
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.660
I don't overthink it as much now.
To me it's just more um,
uh,
uh,
signifies

296
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.640
unintelligence like when someone in a fight with me,

297
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:38.150
if we're together and you say crazy psycho or bitch,

298
00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:39.680
I just lose respect for you because I'm like,

299
00:17:39.681 --> 00:17:42.050
I know you have a bigger vocabulary than that.

300
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.670
And if you're leaning on these sort of like pop terms and these vague terms that

301
00:17:46.671 --> 00:17:49.990
get us nowhere,
like I'm just gonna lose respect for you.
Well,
those words,

302
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.980
unless someone really is crazy and if they are crazy,

303
00:17:52.981 --> 00:17:55.800
we'll stop hanging out with them.
It's like calling someone stupid.
It's not,

304
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.560
it's not productive.
It's not helpful like sometimes called stupid.

305
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:03.210
It's very productive.
It is actually,

306
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:07.930
you know what?
Some good words,
idiot is pretty good if you don't overuse it.
Dumb,

307
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.560
dumb,
dumb me.
I love dummy.

308
00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:14.610
I Love Dominique and dumped up dummy because it's so belittling.

309
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.140
I'm not even going to call you stupid dumb.
It's really less silly.

310
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:22.410
Goose is pretty good.
He's silly.
Silly.
Goose is like,

311
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.250
you can kind of get away with it,
which just silly goes.
Yeah.

312
00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:28.890
You can't really like get mad at someone for calling you a silly goose.

313
00:18:28.891 --> 00:18:31.170
You know what the worst insult?
Like if you,

314
00:18:31.171 --> 00:18:33.660
if you want to hurt the person you're with,

315
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:36.470
what do you say it's going to hurt them?
I don't know.

316
00:18:36.471 --> 00:18:40.520
What do I know that I,
uh,

317
00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:45.780
the most hurt I've been is when a guy said to me in a fight,
not bitch,

318
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:50.010
are we allowed to curse?
I'm sorry.
I think we already have,

319
00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:54.320
I don't know these days,
bitch.
I don't fucking know.
Uh,

320
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:58.340
who's ever told you we can't hardly getting sued?
I don't know.
I'm just,
it's,

321
00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:59.880
it's an instinctive,

322
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:04.560
I have PTSD microphones and sang [inaudible] it's just,
I'm sweating.

323
00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:09.030
I'm already sweating.
None of those words hurt me.

324
00:19:09.031 --> 00:19:12.060
They actually just make me lose respect for you and you personally,
Joe,

325
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.950
what?
I'm pissed at.
These,
they're like clam shells.
I grab grab,

326
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.850
I am like fly trap.
Um,
and is,
uh,
I,

327
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.730
I mean our relationship was going to be over anyway,

328
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.410
but we were arguing about something and he goes,
you know what,
Whitney,

329
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.780
you're a lot,
a lot.

330
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:39.150
You're a lot that bothers you that you know,
it was number one.

331
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.180
You don't even respect me enough to be specific with your insults.

332
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:45.720
You're going to be vague.
And it just meant like all of you is too much.

333
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:50.340
Like you're just too many opinions,
too many things to say.
You're too loud.

334
00:19:50.341 --> 00:19:52.800
It was just like be less of what you are.

335
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:57.720
And that weirdly hurt me more than anything.
That's so strange.
You're a lot.

336
00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.580
If someone,
somebody have said that to me,
I'd be like,
yeah,
bitch.
Yeah.

337
00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:05.640
But it tapped into an insecurity that I already have,
that I'm too much for men,

338
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:10.500
that they,
that I have too much,
too many ideas,
too many opinions.
I'm to Alpha.

339
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.640
Oh,
we're getting deep here.

340
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:16.910
Too much for men guys to guys are not super onboard with girls like having

341
00:20:17.851 --> 00:20:22.470
opinions and,
and appointments and you know,
that sort of thing I've noticed.

342
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:26.070
Really.
Yeah,
like opinions and appointments for the last year.

343
00:20:26.071 --> 00:20:29.670
I've hit my car from guys that I've dated.
Why have you hit your car?

344
00:20:29.671 --> 00:20:31.980
What kind of car you got?
Well,
I had a g,
I have a Tesla now,

345
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:36.510
but I had a g wagon and I used to park it at the guy's house.
I was dating a,

346
00:20:36.511 --> 00:20:37.710
they'd be like,
can I walk to your car?
I'd be like,

347
00:20:37.711 --> 00:20:42.090
I ubered I would Uber like two blocks back to my g wagon.
Shuck and drive home.

348
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.540
Why would you do like weird the mountain emasculate them?

349
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.890
Cause you have a nice car.
Dayton broke dude.

350
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.980
<v 1>I know,
I know Oregon that Seth Macfarlane hit me up.</v>

351
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.900
Um,
I don't know cause I was like,
I don't,

352
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.140
I would never like not date a guy cause he didn't have money.
I don't see my,

353
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:03.360
you know,
I don't think of,
but I guess I did uh,

354
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:08.060
gravitate towards God.
I work,
guys gravitate towards me.
Who,
um,

355
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.970
were intimidated by sort of my alpha.
They're gravitating towards you though.

356
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.740
Yes,
there are those guys.
He'd get taken care of by women and it's very strange.

357
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:22.570
Call me,
I'll make you don't want this guy.
But there's this guy that I know,

358
00:21:22.571 --> 00:21:27.571
he's an actor and he's gone from one older wealthy woman to another older

359
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:33.040
wealthy woman,
divorced,
wealthy woman to another divorce.

360
00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:37.360
Who is a habit too is you're looking for it.
But what he does,
he,
he,

361
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.750
he gets these girls to pay his bills cause he's trying to act.

362
00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.840
He's trying to be an MRI.
That's so not sexy though.
Oh,
it's pathetic.

363
00:21:43.841 --> 00:21:48.520
I've done both.
He's got a ponytail in sold.

364
00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:52.360
I would pay for that high,
um,
suede boots.

365
00:21:52.361 --> 00:21:56.020
Sometimes I want to kill him.
You can't do that when you're broke.

366
00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:57.670
You can do that when you're a rich black man.

367
00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.780
You can't do that when you're a broke.
Like I can't even do that if you're white.

368
00:22:01.781 --> 00:22:03.380
If you're rich,
you can do that.
If you're Farell,

369
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.190
you can't Richard Branson wear knee highs swayed.
But no,

370
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:08.410
it's completely naked moccasins.

371
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:13.840
The guy with the stitching on the bottom around the actions.
You,

372
00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:17.410
would you be attracted to a girl who had more money than you who earned it,

373
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.060
who didn't get it bequeath to her?

374
00:22:19.061 --> 00:22:21.310
I have a theory that guys like girls who inherit money,

375
00:22:21.311 --> 00:22:25.660
but they don't like girls who earn their own money.
Wow.
More money than you.

376
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.830
I don't think they would bother me.
Why don't I have a money problem?
You don't,

377
00:22:29.831 --> 00:22:33.670
but,
but because money represents resources and on a primal,
primordial level,

378
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:38.680
she's the alpha.
What does it mean me?
I'm not worried about money.

379
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.980
You know what I mean?
So that once you have it,
yeah,
I've got plenty.
Yeah.

380
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.660
So it's not like
when you have enough money,

381
00:22:46.661 --> 00:22:50.280
this is the way I've always said,
everything good comes free.
Yes.
You know,

382
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.250
like do you want to buy a car?
We'll go get a car.
Yeah.
Like things become free.

383
00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.910
And when things become free than money stops being an issue.

384
00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.390
When money's really an issue is when you don't have it.
When you don't have it,

385
00:23:01.391 --> 00:23:04.390
someone else has like,
fuck,
I wish I had it right.
How do I get it?

386
00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.930
I'll give you some going to kill me,
so I'm just going to give me sure.

387
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.050
What about the money going to give me sense,

388
00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.310
symbolic and it's still going to money.
She'll come in my womb,

389
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.300
you know?
Right.
It gets this weird fucking,

390
00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:23.560
you get this weird relationship and it starts to represent more than just paying

391
00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:26.020
for a cup of coffee.
It's,
am I a man?
Am I a woman?

392
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:30.010
But I do feel like I have become,

393
00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:32.230
this is gonna sound so sexist.
Uh,

394
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:37.210
I feel like me making or being whatever this thing that has happened where I'm

395
00:23:37.211 --> 00:23:41.620
able to pay my bills,
I'm doing,
I'm miming a weird thing and judge,

396
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.020
um,
funnel

397
00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.450
<v 0>and what movie is,</v>

398
00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:52.451
this isn't going away going indeed it's true guys,

399
00:23:53.001 --> 00:23:57.050
or it has changed a guys' relationship to me.

400
00:23:57.051 --> 00:23:58.940
I've noticed that ever since I started making money.

401
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:04.070
Guys sexually want to dominate me,
choke me,
spit on me.

402
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:08.040
Oh,
I've gotten spit on.
Uh,

403
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.520
that did happen in my twenties when I was broke though I was 20s in Britain and

404
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:16.580
my brain broke.
Guys wanted to coddle me and contact and grab your face.

405
00:24:16.581 --> 00:24:19.520
And where did it,
now that I have money,
I'm getting choked.
I mean,
spanked.

406
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.840
I gotta I gotta I gotta tell me what this is.

407
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:27.830
I had a guy put his four fingers in my mouth and just leave him there for like

408
00:24:27.831 --> 00:24:32.160
two minutes.
Um,
what's that?
I don't know.
Wash your hands.

409
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.520
You have a seven year old.

410
00:24:37.521 --> 00:24:41.690
She's sick because she touches things and then touches her mouth.
Yeah.
Well,

411
00:24:41.691 --> 00:24:45.590
I mean,
you just learn so much about you.
You could never be saying,
oh,
by the way,

412
00:24:45.591 --> 00:24:49.120
today you better make this marriage work forever because you're not going to be

413
00:24:49.121 --> 00:24:51.890
able to handle it because the hands in the mouth,
it's very unsanitary out there,

414
00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:54.500
Joe.
Oh,
hands on.
Well,
I'm not worried about myself,

415
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.110
so he stuck his hand in my mouth and it was,
I've,

416
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.490
I've spent every night at the comedy store for 10 years.

417
00:25:01.491 --> 00:25:02.960
My immune system is on point.

418
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.390
I know I've got to shake about a thousand hands and night

419
00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.810
sharing a microphone with 3,300 road comics every night.

420
00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:15.450
Does a number on your immune system.
I've never been sick and never gets it.
Yeah,

421
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.870
she didn't hold those hands.
Does it?
Or just

422
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.460
sharing a microphone with Jay London.
You're good for a while.

423
00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.110
Um,
he's like pig pen.

424
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:30.440
Everyone's googling j London and no results found on last comic standing.

425
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.670
So he stuck his hand in my mouth and I was like,

426
00:25:34.671 --> 00:25:37.460
this did not happen in my twenties.
And I,
and I'm thinking,
am I,

427
00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.600
or we gagging me,
whatever,
I've lost the plot at this point.

428
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.150
Did you ask them right?
Well,
I'm sitting there and I'm like,

429
00:25:44.151 --> 00:25:48.030
just waiting for something that happened.
I can't wait.

430
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.980
Um,
and so I'm sitting there and I'm like,
and then for a minute I was like,

431
00:25:54.981 --> 00:25:59.240
maybe he lost his balance and he just had,
and he just

432
00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.380
like had to commit to it because it'd be too hard to be like,
sorry.

433
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.960
And then I was like,
maybe he was worried I was going to speak,
or

434
00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:12.320
maybe he just wanted to stop me from talking.
I don't know what it was,

435
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.800
but this did not happen in my twenties when I was broke.
Well,

436
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:17.150
spit on in the face.

437
00:26:17.151 --> 00:26:21.990
Spit in the face was a bit in the dark.
Yes.

438
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:26.430
No,
actually wealthy.
Yes.
Hmm.

439
00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:31.400
Maybe more wealthy than you.
Maybe.
Here's the thing.
Here's the thing.

440
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:36.020
Here's the thing about my,
my,
uh,
this nebulous wealth that I have.

441
00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:40.460
Everyone thinks I have way more than I have and it's been in the press that I

442
00:26:40.461 --> 00:26:41.510
have all this money.

443
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:45.750
So I think guys that do have more money than me think I have more money than

444
00:26:45.751 --> 00:26:50.560
that,
which I sort of,
I see.
So maybe it was,
he,
he thought I had more than I,

445
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.970
so you want to spit on you?
Yeah,
he wanted to go.
Just so you know,

446
00:26:53.971 --> 00:26:58.770
bitch with the Tesla,
you think you're so cute with your TV shows.

447
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.520
I'm about to fucking just treat you like a Thai hooker.

448
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.260
There are people that like that though.
That's where it gets weird.

449
00:27:05.261 --> 00:27:07.740
And if you date someone who likes weird shit,
yes.

450
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:09.660
And then you go to someone else.

451
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:14.160
I've had that recently where I dated,

452
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:18.420
I was in a relationship that was relatively sexually perverse and then dated

453
00:27:18.421 --> 00:27:22.230
someone who was very not.
And I was like way overshot the mark.

454
00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.130
I mean,
am I this?
I'm just fuck it.
Um,

455
00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.840
I am going to be single forever after this bike goes.
Um,

456
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:34.200
I did have a guy whatnot.
Cause here's what you do now.

457
00:27:34.201 --> 00:27:35.760
I need more coffee from Jesus Christ.

458
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:41.490
When you see this is too graphic,
um,

459
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.910
I feel like I'm covering a lot of this stuff so that Neil degrasse Tyson and

460
00:27:43.911 --> 00:27:47.280
covered on this podcast,
are we being,
are we just talking about the moon landing?

461
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:53.110
Um,
you have to gag on Dick's now.
No you don't.
Yeah.

462
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.780
Well if you don't,
you will be exercised.
Yes,

463
00:27:57.781 --> 00:28:00.960
you will be.
Your head will be pushed down.
Um,

464
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.740
yeah guys push your head down and you're like,
oh shit.

465
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:08.070
Okay this is happening.
I'm like,
I have a fucking,

466
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.430
I have a Tesla two blocks away.
Why are you jamming my head on it?

467
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:15.980
And then so I just thought that's how you did it.
And then I dated this guy,
uh,

468
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:19.200
and I did that and he goes,
oh no,
no,
no

469
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.100
bear's name.
He goes,
he goes,
oh,

470
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:29.790
I'm actually not turned on by girls hurting themselves.
And I was like,

471
00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:34.590
Oh God,
I was so embarrassed.
I was so embarrassed.
And I was like,
okay,

472
00:28:34.591 --> 00:28:38.710
I'm till I'm off the grid.
I've been off the grid.
Now I'm back.
Uh,

473
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:41.370
and I just don't know what's normal anymore.

474
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:44.543
Like I don't even know.

475
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.720
<v 1>That's fascinating.
It's was,</v>

476
00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.660
it's fascinating to be a woman who's got a lot of money.

477
00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.370
He's got a lot of power in that,

478
00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:56.880
but in that pretty well you got plenty.
All right.

479
00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:00.620
We don't have to go over to number hopeless.
I'm not a damsel in distress.

480
00:29:00.621 --> 00:29:03.380
I don't need to be rescued,
which a lot of guys want to rescue girls.

481
00:29:03.381 --> 00:29:08.040
I think if you make more than $34,000 you were in the 1% of the world.
Wow.

482
00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:14.180
So you're in the 1% of America.
So that's it.

483
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:15.583
You got a lot of money.

484
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:20.710
So most men are dating girls that are like waitresses or bartenders.

485
00:29:23.001 --> 00:29:26.330
All the costumes you dress up to play role play by the way.
Oh really?

486
00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.440
We're interested is in bartending.

487
00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:31.450
<v 0>Yeah,
it's it.
That is when I really realized like,
oh my gosh,</v>

488
00:29:31.451 --> 00:29:35.530
guys love us to be in like subservient positions cause like roleplay.
Well,
no,

489
00:29:35.531 --> 00:29:40.531
I'm just saying it's very telling that the only sexy costumes available or like

490
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.180
candy striper,
secretary.
Well,
that's a good point.
There's cop,

491
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:50.290
nurse nurses not subservient.
They're kind of taking care of,

492
00:29:50.291 --> 00:29:54.400
it's not doctor true.
There's no doctor.
There's no CEO.

493
00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:57.280
There's no,
yeah,
but there's always been a fighter.

494
00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.360
There is the fantasy of like the boss who calls into the office.

495
00:30:01.361 --> 00:30:04.850
It makes you eat her pussy.
That standpoint,
that's,
there's a lot

496
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.190
that's now I'm,
that's encouraging.
Yeah,

497
00:30:09.191 --> 00:30:13.420
but it's always like the guy has to dominate the boss,
right?
Yeah.
Well,
yeah,

498
00:30:13.421 --> 00:30:14.950
it's always,
she's like,
where's that paper?

499
00:30:14.951 --> 00:30:18.580
And he's like this paper to Dick in your mouth.
It's always like that.

500
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.270
It's never like,
she's like,
you're fired.
And then he just leaves in Jarvis off.

501
00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:27.550
You know?
That's a weird dynamic though.
The one I'm in now that you're,

502
00:30:27.551 --> 00:30:30.190
you're making me think about it.
I never dated a girl who made a lot of money,

503
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.640
never dated a girl who made more money than me.
That's for sure.

504
00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.210
I'm thinking about it.
Never.
I don't think so.

505
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.370
Maybe when I was like really broke.

506
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:43.900
I think that like I'm recently divorced,
guys are into it.

507
00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:48.280
Oh right.
Cause they don't have to pay.
They just had to pay,

508
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.340
give half of their shit away.
So I feel like they're a little more receptive to,

509
00:30:51.341 --> 00:30:53.380
so I literally was saying to friends of mine,
like,
Hey,
set me up with,

510
00:30:53.381 --> 00:30:55.240
you're recently divorced friends.
They'll be into it.

511
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.910
But don't you think that there's like this a broad dynamic,
right?
There's a lot.

512
00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.990
There's a lot of different kinds of people.

513
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.180
I used to have to find someone who's into a strong woman,

514
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:08.770
but not like a Beta man.
That's the thing.
Like someone who's more alpha than me.

515
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:12.160
You don't want like a male feminist who's like catering to you,

516
00:31:12.161 --> 00:31:13.180
who's like a Beta,

517
00:31:13.181 --> 00:31:17.980
who wants to take care of the kids who doesn't want to work and stay home and an

518
00:31:17.981 --> 00:31:21.910
equal.
I lose respect for people very quickly.

519
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.720
And so it needs to be your competitive,
it's what it is.
You're a predator.

520
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:29.420
That's true.
Not a Predator in a bad way,
but you have predatory instincts.

521
00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:34.480
You see weaknesses pretty quickly.
I do,
yeah.
And once I see it,
I can't unsee it.

522
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.930
That's why that guy freaked you out when he said you're a lot,

523
00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.670
because I'll tell you a lot,
but I'd say it's a good thing.
Like you're a lot.

524
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:47.210
He hit all my insecurity of I'm not feminine and like I just want like in a

525
00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.970
relationship.
I don't want to be the alpha.

526
00:31:48.971 --> 00:31:53.590
I want to be like the subservient obsequious Asian girl.
Quite frankly,

527
00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.020
I don't want to have to be the boss in my relationship.

528
00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:00.310
I want this to turn into some weird sort of dating advice.
Well,

529
00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.130
you stop letting me talk to the dog.

530
00:32:03.131 --> 00:32:06.970
It's so good for disaster.
Fascinating.

531
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:08.830
People are excited about this right now.

532
00:32:08.831 --> 00:32:11.710
It's dudes at their pants off all around the world.
Thank God.
Hit me up.

533
00:32:11.711 --> 00:32:15.760
I'll pay you
just,

534
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:22.150
you don't want to pay their bills.
It'll get ugly,
ugly.
I'll pay the,

535
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:26.890
I won't pay the ostensible bill.
I'll pay the valet.
You pay the,

536
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:32.980
I'll pay the half of the house in the vacations you cover the valet.
Oh,

537
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:34.690
how about that?
That sounds like a good dude.

538
00:32:34.691 --> 00:32:37.930
I don't want anyone to think I'm pink because I did date a guy that did not have

539
00:32:37.931 --> 00:32:42.931
money and I would wire him money and so that he could pay him.

540
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.180
When we basically said that when we went out to dinner,
he could pay.

541
00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.120
Whoa.
So that people didn't think I was paying.
Yeah,
that was a mistake.

542
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:54.230
I'm not going to do that again.
That was like a week ago.
That was

543
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:58.423
Hashtag [inaudible]

544
00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:02.160
<v 1>bizarre.
Well,
I would imagine it's probably very hard.
I mean,</v>

545
00:33:02.161 --> 00:33:03.840
you're saying it's very hard,
but I would imagine that

546
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.910
<v 0>it's hard anyway.
I,
you know,
again,
it's,
you know,
I'm not like,</v>

547
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:12.500
I need to get married tomorrow and did a Ba da Da da,
you know,
so I'm not,
um,

548
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.840
but it's all,
you know,
it's good comedian.

549
00:33:14.841 --> 00:33:16.310
The good news about it being a comedian is you're like,

550
00:33:16.311 --> 00:33:20.930
I got to use it all I could to alchemize this and sublimated this pain and to

551
00:33:20.931 --> 00:33:23.320
jokes.
Yeah.
I just try to use it.

552
00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:23.701
<v 1>Well,</v>

553
00:33:23.701 --> 00:33:27.060
you've been doing that a lot on stage talking about this kind of stuff on stage.

554
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.690
<v 0>Oh yeah.
Yes I did in my last session.
I was like,
Huh?
I have not.</v>

555
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:36.000
I have not done standup,
and since I shot my special,
I try to take it back.

556
00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.370
I tried to take like three months off after every special because I feel like

557
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.210
number one,
I don't like doing old material because I feel like a half,

558
00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.970
like I just feel like gross.
And then number two,

559
00:33:46.971 --> 00:33:50.780
I feel like I start doing a bad impression of myself if I do it,

560
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.920
if I don't take a break and rewire my brain.
Right.

561
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.770
<v 1>Okay.
That's interesting.
Reboot Stan hope blocks to do that.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.</v>

562
00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:01.290
Stan hope takes back chunks of time off.
Yeah,
he's detoxing probably.

563
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:05.970
He's got aids right now.
He just told me as aids.

564
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:06.840
She told me

565
00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.690
<v 0>that's not true.
No.
Oh,
she,
I was like,
you should fucking Charlie Sheen.</v>

566
00:34:09.691 --> 00:34:13.320
I'm coming.
Jesus Christ.
Oh my God.
That was good enough.
Sucks.
So he's really,

567
00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:17.310
yeah.
Yeah.
Very gone.
Do you have him?
No.
Very drunk of him.
Oh,

568
00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.510
God killed his dick with booze.
Is that something you can,

569
00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.920
they can bounce back your concern.

570
00:34:26.390 --> 00:34:29.250
He's on my hit list,
but he's literally my tie.
Hi.

571
00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:31.110
<v 1>He's the perfect guy for me.</v>

572
00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:33.870
I know you have to talk to you thinking problem needs money.

573
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.200
Cam doesn't need money.
He makes a lot of money.
Yeah,
I guess that's true.

574
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:40.650
It doesn't have a big overhead.
Doesn't even live in New Mexico.
Arizona.

575
00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:44.010
Bisbee Arizona.
He owns like a shock.
He's got the most bizarre house.

576
00:34:44.011 --> 00:34:47.160
Pull up an image of Doug's Tan hope's house cause he puts it up online.

577
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.440
Not only as he put it up online,
he tells you where he lives.

578
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.660
He knows no one's going to rob them.
Oh they do?
They could.

579
00:34:51.661 --> 00:34:53.340
Problem does nothing there go,
go rob.

580
00:34:53.341 --> 00:34:55.750
When he goes to do steal one was wacky suits.
Do you get someone straight store?

581
00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.550
He doesn't.
He doesn't pop off vodka.

582
00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:02.880
He's got like a laptop.
He'll,
you know,
he's still,
that'll go get another one.

583
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:05.540
I saw a comedy joke books,
comedy star.

584
00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:09.960
He had that like plastic gallon of pop hall.
Vod.

585
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:13.350
There's this house.
This is a,
this is a party that he puts on.

586
00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:17.970
I fucking love him cause he's the real deal.
He's like a real American original.

587
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:20.670
He has a house in Bisbee,
Arizona.

588
00:35:20.671 --> 00:35:25.210
He gives out the address online and people come to his house for a Superbowl

589
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:29.220
party.
Regular people,
he doesn't anybody,
anybody.
They drive.

590
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:33.630
People have flown in from other countries and driven the Bisbee Arizona to come

591
00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:33.961
to Doug,

592
00:35:33.961 --> 00:35:36.580
Stan hope's house and they come into his living room and hang out with them.

593
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.970
He's got a girlfriend Bingo.
Who's doing the shit out of her fucking mind.

594
00:35:41.971 --> 00:35:46.320
Crazy like medicated sees things that aren't there like suicidal or I heard them

595
00:35:46.321 --> 00:35:50.100
on stern I think could be,
you know,
I don't know if she's suicidal.

596
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:54.750
She's hilarious.
He's still having,
he still has a relationship and I don't,

597
00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.870
yeah,
all of the on sex relationship.

598
00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:02.650
I guess it's just not sexual because he can't fuck or because doesn't,

599
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:07.260
it doesn't have any desire to.
Interesting.
Yeah.
Very interesting.

600
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:09.180
You know,

601
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.960
I think if you just drank all the time and don't take care of your body,

602
00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.350
just that Surratt.
Yup.

603
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:19.650
Well I think most of you go into survival mode.

604
00:36:19.651 --> 00:36:21.630
I'm sure his body's just trying to keep him alive.

605
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:26.280
I don't have time to fuck right now.
I don't know.
Maybe we shouldn't procreate.

606
00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:31.550
That's just stop this.
It could be that it's cigarettes to cigarettes definitely.

607
00:36:31.551 --> 00:36:34.320
And Kill your sex drive.
How old is he?
He's my age.

608
00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:38.400
He's 48 but you look like you're like Benjamin Button.

609
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.790
You're like aging backwards.
Well I work out a lot.
He doesn't,

610
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:44.640
but he makes fun of me.
He's like,
how many surgeries have had,
I'm like,

611
00:36:44.641 --> 00:36:48.480
I've had a bunch surgeries,
cracking joints and all that kind of stuff.

612
00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.393
It was ripping them.

613
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:54.170
Are you worried about your body from um,

614
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:59.280
martial arts?
I used to be worried.
Yeah,
but everybody dies.

615
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:00.960
Everybody dies.
Yeah.

616
00:37:00.961 --> 00:37:03.510
I mean I worry about some things when things aren't going so well.

617
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:07.860
What happens when you don't work out?
Get this fixed your shoulder?
No,
no,
no.

618
00:37:07.861 --> 00:37:11.860
I'm saying like when things go wrong,
I started going,
oh this,

619
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:15.240
this one might not be good.
What's going on here?
This is clicking shit.

620
00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:19.110
Don't get an Mri and might break things up.
But I've had so many things fixed,

621
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:23.730
you know.
Do you think that surgery is now improved?

622
00:37:23.731 --> 00:37:28.710
Cause I heard that the RG three surgeries on his knee and it wasn't as that the

623
00:37:28.711 --> 00:37:31.950
quarterback for the Redskins who's a RG three know football.

624
00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:35.190
Oh literally don't even know the rules.
God love that.

625
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.100
I don't know anything really.
Yeah.
The only thing Chris,

626
00:37:38.101 --> 00:37:40.950
sexier than a guide knowing everything is the guy knowing nothing.
I just left.

627
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:41.850
I don't know anything.

628
00:37:41.851 --> 00:37:45.780
Like I had a friend of mine invite me over to a Superbowl party and I thank God

629
00:37:45.781 --> 00:37:48.120
I had a fucking excuse,
but he,
look,
he just

630
00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:54.450
wasn't a super bowl party I guess.
Super Bowl's in February.

631
00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:57.480
It was a football party on Monday night football party.

632
00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.410
Only reason I know it's because the um,

633
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.990
a guy that owns it was explaining to me that the,
um,

634
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:08.010
the knee surgeries made his knees better than they were before the injury.

635
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.050
My knee's would definitely better than they were before.

636
00:38:10.051 --> 00:38:12.680
My surgeries can now improve your,
well,

637
00:38:12.681 --> 00:38:16.440
I've had ACL reconstruction on both my knees and the way they do it now.

638
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.130
Why have one that did the older way,
which is a Patella tendon graft,

639
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:23.880
who they take a big slice of your patella tendon and then they open you up like

640
00:38:23.881 --> 00:38:28.770
a fish and then they drill it into the knee,
the uh,
the Tibia and the fibula.

641
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:32.610
And um,
that one's definitely stronger than a regular ACL.

642
00:38:32.611 --> 00:38:36.040
And then my other one I had replaced with a cadaver ACL,

643
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.250
<v 2>which is even stronger because it's,
um,</v>

644
00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:44.170
they use a achilles tendon,
which is much larger.
Oh,
wow.
And it's,

645
00:38:44.171 --> 00:38:45.004
uh,

646
00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:48.820
that one is much less invasive to like the recovery time was incredibly quick.

647
00:38:48.821 --> 00:38:53.680
Like I was a,
I went to a party five days afterwards.
No cane,
no nothin.

648
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:57.700
Yeah.
It was crazy.
Just walk around,
pimp,
pimp lamp,
just walked around.

649
00:38:57.701 --> 00:39:00.550
I didn't even have a limp.
Wow.
I mean w I didn't have full flex Asian,

650
00:39:00.551 --> 00:39:01.780
like I couldn't bend it all the way,

651
00:39:01.781 --> 00:39:05.420
but Aquino get enough where it looked normal.
Like I just walk in my shoulder

652
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:10.100
<v 0>and I should have gotten surgery.
Surgery would have like dramatic,</v>

653
00:39:10.101 --> 00:39:11.840
like the way he would've done it would've made it better.

654
00:39:11.841 --> 00:39:14.900
I just didn't want to get surgery.
Wow.
Long goes us.
Ah,
two years.

655
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.980
<v 2>I just had,
um,
four,</v>

656
00:39:16.981 --> 00:39:20.370
four months ago I had stem cell shots in my shoulder.
Yeah.

657
00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:24.810
That was going to go Vegas.
Oh.
I was going to,
um,

658
00:39:24.811 --> 00:39:28.410
get soldier shoulder surgery cause I had a labor room tear and a rotator cuff

659
00:39:28.411 --> 00:39:29.640
tear and there's some bro.

660
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:33.210
I apparently I've dislocated my shoulder before and Jujitsu didn't know it.

661
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:38.130
I didn't know.
But that's,
Jujitsu is fucking so brutal.
Yeah.
When you're,

662
00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:38.760
you know,

663
00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.780
engaging in sport for 20 years and the whole purpose of the sport is trying to

664
00:39:42.781 --> 00:39:46.160
break bodies,
things go wrong,
you know.
And um,

665
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:49.500
I guess my shoulder got dislocated and pop back in place and I didn't know

666
00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.600
broken shit in there.
Yeah.

667
00:39:51.601 --> 00:39:56.250
And then I heard it again from practicing archery and from lifting too much

668
00:39:56.251 --> 00:40:00.330
weight.
So I just literally pulled some of the tendon off the bone,

669
00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.110
literally pulled it off myself.
Like I didn't,
I didn't do it.
Nope.

670
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.080
It wasn't like someone yanked on it or I fell,

671
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.050
I just kept pulling my shoulder gets sore.
I'm like,
shut up pussy.

672
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:16.390
<v 0>Oh yeah.
See that.
And you've got,
see I have that inner monologue of if it hurts,</v>

673
00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:20.170
you're doing something right.
That's how I grew up.
You know,
if you're in pain,

674
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.550
like you'd think shit hurt.
And so I never athletic thing though.
Yeah.

675
00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:25.150
I never say uncle,

676
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:28.830
<v 2>but you can get,
if your shoulders still fucked up,
you get these uh,</v>

677
00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.230
stem cell shots.
Now the around,
I'm sorry,

678
00:40:31.231 --> 00:40:34.890
I got the plasma where they spin out the white blood cells.
Is it that one?
No,

679
00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:39.480
definitely platelet rich plasma.
Prp.
Prp.
Yeah.

680
00:40:39.481 --> 00:40:42.660
And that's really good that that helps.
Healing reduces inflammation.

681
00:40:42.661 --> 00:40:45.690
And there's a more advanced version of that,
which is called Regena keen,

682
00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.870
which I had a series of those done in my shoulder and which helped a lot,

683
00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:51.750
but it was more of a temporary fix.
It would help.

684
00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.970
It would reduce the inflammation,
it would help the pain.

685
00:40:53.971 --> 00:40:57.930
But then slowly but surely,
cause I kept working out,
the pain would,
you know,

686
00:40:57.931 --> 00:40:58.770
sort of reemerged,

687
00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:03.900
but the stem cell shots were a fucking complete game changer.
Wow.

688
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:07.500
And people always ask,
how much does it cost?
It costs,
it costs $2,500,

689
00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:12.240
which is a lot of money.
I know,
but the fucking result,
one shot,

690
00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:17.310
I mean my shoulders.
Fantastic.
Now I worked out today.
No problems,

691
00:41:17.311 --> 00:41:21.390
no pain.
Yeah.
I mean I did chin-ups a,
I did rose and all these different things.

692
00:41:21.391 --> 00:41:24.990
It doesn't bother me at all.
Like,
nope,
no pain.
I was like that close to surgery.

693
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.500
I was like,
I just can't keep doing this.
Like it used to make all these clicks.

694
00:41:28.501 --> 00:41:31.800
It makes way less clicks now.
I used to have to wear that shirt

695
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:34.100
<v 0>that the,
the good,
the shirt</v>

696
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.980
<v 1>that has velcro on the back that pulls your shoulders down.</v>

697
00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.440
It's like I'd have to wear it like 30 minutes to wait.
The one that,

698
00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:43.550
who's that basketball player?
Uh,
that,
where is it?
Yeah,
the tall,

699
00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:48.400
tall black guy.
Does that narrow it down?
Um,
it's a whatever.

700
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:51.800
It's a shirt that it's probably a compression shirt but has velcro on the top of

701
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:55.010
the bottom and they adjust it so that it changes the way that you walk and
stuff.

702
00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:57.790
Cause there's,
well,

703
00:41:57.791 --> 00:42:02.680
there's just amazing new innovations in science and medicine.
Like the,

704
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:06.230
what they're able to do.
There's this guy,
I think his name's Peter Willing,

705
00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:10.370
the guy who invented Regena king,
uh,
who's in Germany,
Dusseldorf,
Germany,

706
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:12.710
and he has fucking Germans always,

707
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:16.130
well they don't have the same restrictions that we had for the longest time.

708
00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:17.781
The fucking,

709
00:42:17.781 --> 00:42:21.860
the entire Bush administration fucked science and medicine in this country where

710
00:42:21.861 --> 00:42:23.390
they couldn't do stem cell research.

711
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:27.060
And then they finally figured out how to do all tall autonomous stem cell.

712
00:42:27.061 --> 00:42:31.870
I'll Tom Wallace.
Wow.
Are you saying I'll Google that tall Agus autologous,
uh,

713
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.990
three fat.
They take stem cell through your own fat or through your bone marrow.

714
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:39.740
They drill a hole in your hip.
They suck marrow out,
make stem cells out of that,

715
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.230
but they don't even have to do that anymore.

716
00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:45.200
Now they use placenta from a woman who has a sincerity and section.
Yeah.

717
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:47.510
They take that placenta,
make stem cells out of that.

718
00:42:47.511 --> 00:42:49.940
And that's what I got on my face.
Did you do?

719
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:55.070
You put that text placenta and claustrum claustrum and spit apparently

720
00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:00.950
lot of weird fluids on my face.
Well,
this guy,
this doctor is,

721
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:05.990
they are literally months away from releasing this new procedure that they have

722
00:43:05.991 --> 00:43:08.930
that reinvigorates Collagen in your skin,

723
00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.800
like changes your body's production of Collagen.

724
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:16.340
They have some sort of an injection and through that injection your body

725
00:43:16.341 --> 00:43:19.430
reproduces college and like it did when you were 20 wow.
Yeah.

726
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:23.090
People's faces just couldn't go.
Right.
Those are just going to go away.

727
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.870
They're like,
this is fucking complete.
Total game changer.
Wow.

728
00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.280
When is that coming out?
Well,

729
00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:30.500
they're setting up the infrastructure when now just to deal with the amount of

730
00:43:30.501 --> 00:43:33.440
patients,
the overwhelming amount of patients that are going on debt.

731
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.590
As soon as this happens,

732
00:43:34.591 --> 00:43:36.860
there's going to be like a trillion dollar business once it launches.

733
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:41.450
Let me ask you a question.
Would you as a man do it?
Fuck yeah.
Why not?
Yeah,

734
00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:43.960
why not?
Good.
Why not?
I'm glad to know.
I mean,

735
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:47.180
I don't think I could get my fucking face.
I wouldn't get my nose fixed.

736
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.700
I don't think I would get my lips done.

737
00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:54.340
I had my nose fixed the inside of it.
Oh,
got it.
Like a,

738
00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:55.820
the cartilage and all this shit.

739
00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:58.700
But it actually made my nose wider in some way cause I think they showed these

740
00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:01.830
wedges in your face.
You don't want to smell it.
No,

741
00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:03.590
I don't want us to have you broken in a ton of times.

742
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:09.570
I don't even know how many times.
Oh yeah.
Steven go to get it fixed.
Broken.

743
00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.610
And once I did,

744
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:15.440
but I didn't get it fixed until I was 39 or something like that.
38,

745
00:44:15.441 --> 00:44:19.820
39 maybe when I got it done.
But it was amazing.
Oh God.

746
00:44:19.821 --> 00:44:22.130
It was the craziest thing.
I broke it for the first time when I was five.

747
00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:25.760
I fell down a flight of stairs when I was five.
He smashed my is like,

748
00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:31.980
well I was a latchkey kid.
Opened the door,
get outside,
you know?
Yes.
And uh,

749
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.550
<v 2>I fell down a flight of stairs,
smash my nose.
And it's been crooked ever since.</v>

750
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.440
But the inside of it was all fucked up.

751
00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:42.360
And then from a lifetime of martial arts,
kickboxing,

752
00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.450
it's just been hit so many times.
It was always bleeding.

753
00:44:45.451 --> 00:44:48.930
There's always something in there.
So yeah,
when you were nosebleeds,

754
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:54.270
you've seen cauliflower ear.
Cauliflower ear is from the break in the ear.

755
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.900
When the tissue breaks away,
uh,

756
00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:01.080
it fills up with blood and that blood calcifies that also happens in your nose.

757
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:06.380
So the inside of my nose was sealed with hard calcified blood that had just,

758
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:10.560
it had just spins smash so many times that I couldn't breathe.

759
00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:13.920
Like I had no breathing out of my nose.
Like this one was like my left nostril,

760
00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:17.000
right nostril was just walking

761
00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:19.830
<v 0>down the wall is not good for an athlete's terrible.
Yeah.</v>

762
00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.420
Especially for kickboxing.
So I always had my mouth open.
Yeah.

763
00:45:22.421 --> 00:45:25.300
And you have three race or a mouth guard.
Yeah,

764
00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.160
<v 2>exactly.</v>

765
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.100
So it's hard to breathe and if you open your mouth and you can hit with your jaw

766
00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:32.100
open,
you get fucked up.
So it was never good,

767
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.820
but I didn't get it fixed for the longest time.
But once I did get it fixed,

768
00:45:35.821 --> 00:45:36.840
it was amazing.
It was like,

769
00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:40.480
<v 0>I know
you're like,</v>

770
00:45:40.481 --> 00:45:42.860
is this how everybody just lives all the time?

771
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:45.710
<v 2>They shove these,
these big fucking things up my nose.</v>

772
00:45:45.711 --> 00:45:49.330
He's big like foam tubes and stretched it out and he cut it.

773
00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:52.670
There's things called turbinates in their big trim,
the turbinates.

774
00:45:52.671 --> 00:45:56.450
So they literally changed the shape of the inside of my nose and shove these

775
00:45:56.451 --> 00:45:58.610
things up my nose like a little wider.

776
00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:03.550
<v 0>Um,
uh,
I get really bad migraines.
And when we were brainstorming,</v>

777
00:46:03.551 --> 00:46:06.730
like trying to figure out what it was like playing like whack a mole with how to

778
00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:08.770
eliminate certain variables,

779
00:46:08.771 --> 00:46:13.390
they did cortisone in my sinuses and that made me breathe so much better.

780
00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.170
Quarter cortisone in my sinus.
So you had some sort of inflammation.

781
00:46:17.171 --> 00:46:20.940
A lot of us have like sinus inflammation we just don't know about.

782
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:24.970
And it wasn't like much less nasal.
And I sounded less like Fran Drescher,
which

783
00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:33.400
people like that though.
Don't know.
That sounds so like five minutes.

784
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:38.410
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
There's no surgery.
Whatever.</v>

785
00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.710
<v 0>No surgery.
Yeah.
So,
but if your shoulders still fucks with you,</v>

786
00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.960
you should really think about all women have,

787
00:46:43.961 --> 00:46:48.250
we hold a lot of our emotion here and in our shoulders and necks and purses.

788
00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.080
So my surgeon was like,

789
00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:53.680
you cannot carry of 30 pound purse with all your shit and what you need.

790
00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.210
What is fanny fanny man

791
00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:02.140
get you really?
Can I get a uh,
Joe Rogan Manny back please?

792
00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:06.160
When you're new shipment,
contact them.
Get a ship.
Yeah,

793
00:47:06.161 --> 00:47:10.450
because women we carry,
I was carrying a purse on my broken shoulder.

794
00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.840
Oh really?
Fuck me up and I do it.
Why won't you carry on your other shoulder?

795
00:47:13.841 --> 00:47:15.850
Because I mean it's just like,
even when this was,

796
00:47:15.851 --> 00:47:18.490
I did six months of physical therapy on this right.
One,

797
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:21.640
which is as I'm sure you've gone through is so fucking boring.

798
00:47:21.641 --> 00:47:24.430
You just sit there and have to rock it back and forth and like hold you,

799
00:47:24.431 --> 00:47:27.610
get to a place to do it.
Yeah.
Colon.
Hello.
Yeah,
I did it right once

800
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:29.650
<v 2>and then I went home and I got these band.
I'm like,</v>

801
00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.850
<v 0>you're just resizes my come just do it at home.
It's crazy.
It's so annoying.</v>

802
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:37.810
And then I had to,
um,
because of,
you know more about this than anyone,

803
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:38.920
if I heard this thing,

804
00:47:38.921 --> 00:47:42.400
it affects the left and then it affects my hips and then cause it's all

805
00:47:42.401 --> 00:47:45.880
connected.
So I started sort of having to do my whole body and written in that.

806
00:47:45.881 --> 00:47:48.380
That's when I got an ass.
[inaudible] Yep.
That happens.

807
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:50.380
A lot of people not getting an ass,
but you're like,

808
00:47:50.381 --> 00:47:52.540
you hurt your knee and then because of your knee,

809
00:47:52.541 --> 00:47:56.030
you'll get all the gold paint left hip problem because it's all about the badge.

810
00:47:56.050 --> 00:48:00.060
Right.
And I am hyper mobile,
hypermobile,
hypermobile,

811
00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:04.480
which means I lift and Ron and everything with my bones and not my muscles.

812
00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:06.970
So I had to relearn how to like,
fuck this up man.

813
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:12.400
Very like western European inbred bullshit sort of thing.

814
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:16.220
I also have,
um,
uh,
Osgood slaughter is in my knees.
What does,

815
00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:20.770
which just means you're,
you get like a bone spurt and your bones grow too fast.

816
00:48:20.771 --> 00:48:25.770
So I have like this,
oh hollow,
it's a tumor.

817
00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:29.070
It's just like a box.
It's like a ball of nerves and aliens,

818
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:34.420
just gee it probably GMOs plus like a,
I would imagine.

819
00:48:34.421 --> 00:48:38.710
Plus like you know,
a western European Mutt,
alcoholism gene.

820
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:42.270
And so the bones get like,
does it hurt or do you just,

821
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:47.140
I had like a just grew too fast.
Real,
you know,
that happened to my massive,

822
00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:52.990
huge with dogs,
especially purebred dogs.
They were sick.
Like he was getting,

823
00:48:52.991 --> 00:48:57.460
getting some like limping issues and it was when he was a puppy and they were

824
00:48:57.461 --> 00:48:59.860
saying that his,
he has too much protein is food.

825
00:48:59.861 --> 00:49:04.240
You have to buy him blow large dog food.
And I'm like,
what?

826
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.190
Like real large breed.
Cause I was feeding him like raw eggs.
Yeah.

827
00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:13.000
It really healthy stuff.
And his,
uh,
his body was growing too fast.
Wow.

828
00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:15.400
He's getting like you would have like a limp and I thought,
oh,

829
00:49:15.401 --> 00:49:16.121
it might have hurt himself.

830
00:49:16.121 --> 00:49:20.210
So I brought him in because I've had dogs that had ACL surgery.
I had,
um,

831
00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:22.540
yeah,
they have notorious,

832
00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.960
I have a pit and a great Dane puppy who I'm going to the same thing with.

833
00:49:25.961 --> 00:49:29.920
He's just growing stuff.
I had this female pit that had a rear legs done.

834
00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.330
She had one rear leg,

835
00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:34.210
like Halston shed this weird limp when she was walking around with one foot off

836
00:49:34.211 --> 00:49:35.250
the ground.
So I brought her in.

837
00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:39.340
They had a fix that they do it by changing the angle of the bone.

838
00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.730
They cut the bone so the bone like it doesn't,
you know,

839
00:49:42.731 --> 00:49:45.640
like instead of it like falling backwards,

840
00:49:45.641 --> 00:49:48.940
they cut it at an angle so that it doesn't do that.
Interesting.

841
00:49:48.941 --> 00:49:50.020
It's weird how they do it.

842
00:49:50.021 --> 00:49:52.690
They don't do it like a person where they replaced the ligament.

843
00:49:52.691 --> 00:49:57.160
They change the shape of the bone.
Can I just say something random?
I'm so glad.

844
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.401
I mean,

845
00:49:57.401 --> 00:50:00.460
I'm sure we'll look back in 20 years and there'll be so much new technology and

846
00:50:00.461 --> 00:50:02.830
we're like,
I can't believe we live in a day where we didn't have the,
the,

847
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:07.560
the stem cell injectors at our home or whatever.
But like,

848
00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.720
my dad got sick with my animals getting sick.
I'm like,

849
00:50:10.721 --> 00:50:13.780
thank God we don't live in the fucking 20s when they were guessing,

850
00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:17.590
they were just guessing like they worked out all the kinks.
Yes.

851
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:23.230
Did you ever see that movie I'm with in order to Caprio uh,

852
00:50:23.231 --> 00:50:28.190
where he played the aviator?
He was,
he was there with his parents,

853
00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:28.640
Howard Hughes.

854
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.000
His parents were telling him like listen to the doctor you need to smoke

855
00:50:32.001 --> 00:50:34.690
cigarettes cause it would make you more vigorous.
Oh Geez.

856
00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:39.810
Let's say they used to tell people that is milk is good for you is it's supposed

857
00:50:41.001 --> 00:50:41.870
to be.
Um,

858
00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:44.900
definitely not good for explaining that because of the amount of it actually

859
00:50:44.901 --> 00:50:49.310
strips your bounds of vitamin D in some way.
I don't know.

860
00:50:49.311 --> 00:50:52.310
I'm not an expert but we might look back when I'd be like milk isn't as good for

861
00:50:52.311 --> 00:50:54.080
you as we thought.
Here's the deal with milk.

862
00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:57.590
This is a big part of what's wrong with milk,
homogenization and pasteurization.

863
00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:00.740
So when you're drinking milk you're drinking milk with no enzymes in it cause

864
00:51:00.741 --> 00:51:03.650
it's all boiled down here on the shelf for a year.
Yeah.

865
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:06.290
Even cooked overcooking vegetables.
You're not really getting that,
you know,

866
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:09.980
and some vegetable ordering a salad at a restaurant could be the most unhealthy

867
00:51:09.981 --> 00:51:12.340
thing cause it has so much fertilizers and chemicals and stuff on it.

868
00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:18.130
That's a big one because Wa water that's running off from the fields,

869
00:51:18.131 --> 00:51:22.210
from pastures where cows are shitting and that can,
that can be a real issue.

870
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.300
Women get over 50% of their calories from salad dressing.

871
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.110
What I brought that

872
00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:36.250
challenged
Jesus Christ,

873
00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:41.000
I
always eat salads and they think they're eating so healthy and they're just

874
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:45.380
eating like salad crew tones.
The GARP,
trans fats,

875
00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:48.590
the almost sometimes the worst thing you can get the grocery store is just an

876
00:51:48.591 --> 00:51:52.700
apple because of all the shit in it and chemicals on it and the dyes and the

877
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:56.060
know what I like on Salad.
I like oil,
olive oil and vinegar,

878
00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.990
but good luck trying to find that shit at a restaurant.
Yeah,

879
00:51:58.991 --> 00:52:02.390
it's hard to get oil and vinegar.
Most restaurants do.
I want to give you a ball.

880
00:52:02.391 --> 00:52:04.790
Sorry,
age.
It's true.
It's true.
Garbage.

881
00:52:04.791 --> 00:52:09.170
Garbage be that guy that shows up with the dressing and it's flat.
It's not good.

882
00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:14.200
That guy is not my vagina will dry up and can you imagine,

883
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:16.970
would have a guy shows up with his own wine

884
00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.920
at a restaurant alone.
Okay.

885
00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:25.220
Drink it out of a flask like an adult.

886
00:52:25.221 --> 00:52:28.880
How would you feel if you went to a date with a guy and you went to a fancy

887
00:52:28.881 --> 00:52:33.470
restaurant and he pulled out?
He had a bag with him,
like a velvet pulled out,

888
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:35.223
pulled out

889
00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:43.010
a Sutter home.
You got to bring your own wine and it's like a white one.

890
00:52:43.011 --> 00:52:44.960
You should really go die.
I have a good one.

891
00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:47.090
I went out with a guy who was an actor,

892
00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:52.550
said that that's how you start mocking.
You want to be an actor.

893
00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:57.450
What a great idea.
There's none of those and flood the market.

894
00:52:57.451 --> 00:52:59.000
It was more of an actress actually.

895
00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:04.460
He had long hair and he likes sort of economy and to going out to dinner with

896
00:53:04.461 --> 00:53:08.210
them and it's the guy that was dating my,
my friends.
The older ladies,

897
00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:10.270
the same guy with the knee high.

898
00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.610
I don't know who that guy is,

899
00:53:13.611 --> 00:53:16.580
but possibly actually works quite a bit.

900
00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:20.990
And we went out and comfortably a foot and a half shorter than me or less feels

901
00:53:20.991 --> 00:53:25.380
like it.
And he was wearing his hair down.
When the food came,

902
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:30.180
he put his hair up,
oh Christ.
And then when they took the plate away,

903
00:53:30.181 --> 00:53:35.040
he took it back down and he's going to die.
I mean,
I literally was like,
I can't,

904
00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:39.990
I don't,
what do I do?
Is that why we should own guns?

905
00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:44.010
As I was like,
I now feel like we all need it all at a handgun.
I need to hang up.

906
00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:47.910
And he did when he was talking about like a trip to like Italy or something.

907
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:51.240
And when he taught he'd be like,
you know,

908
00:53:51.241 --> 00:53:54.030
and then the police said to me are saying,
but GE,
Ge,

909
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:56.010
which means take a left there and that.

910
00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:00.300
So he would talk in Italian and then translate it for me.
It was such a bummer.

911
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.260
He's trying to let you know that he's bilingual.
Yeah,

912
00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:07.950
I don't like it when guys hurt themselves.
You don't need to.

913
00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.270
<v 1>Oh Man.
It's on a turn on my mouth is numb.</v>

914
00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:12.830
<v 0>I've had a lot of really,</v>

915
00:54:12.831 --> 00:54:17.831
cause I haven't just stom sort of single goalie and like I also went on a date

916
00:54:17.991 --> 00:54:20.780
with a guy who at the end of the day,
um,

917
00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:25.220
put his hand up and said,
all right dude.

918
00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:32.150
Wow.
Yeah.
That's a rough one.
That was rough.
I thought I had been shot.

919
00:54:32.151 --> 00:54:36.380
I felt like I had been shot.
All right dude.
It was actually like a,
what's this?

920
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:37.543
What's this thing when you're,

921
00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:41.470
<v 1>it's like a springing back.
Yeah.
Going forward.</v>

922
00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.550
Roll a ball and you're gonna go for it.

923
00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:54.660
<v 0>That's what I got.
I was like,</v>

924
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:59.150
that's when I realized like,
Oh,
I'm now gender neutral.

925
00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.450
<v 1>I don't even,
I think,</v>

926
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:05.870
I think what you've nailed it already is that there's a lot of guys that are

927
00:55:05.871 --> 00:55:09.630
intimidated by the fact you're successful and ambitious.
And I think that's a,

928
00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:11.360
that's a legit concern.
You know,
I was,

929
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:15.280
I was listening to this Ted talk a Ted radio hour rather than,

930
00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:21.260
have you heard about the salad dressing?
It was one of the recent ones.

931
00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:25.700
Um,
I forget what the name of the title was,
but um,
uh,

932
00:55:25.701 --> 00:55:26.870
disruptive leadership,

933
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:32.150
that was the one where the woman was talking about the word bossy and about how

934
00:55:32.151 --> 00:55:36.590
women are told to not be bossy.
Like if a man does it,
he's assertive.

935
00:55:36.591 --> 00:55:40.460
But if a woman does it,
it's the first time that ever heard that,
that I thought,

936
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:44.390
Ooh,
maybe there's something to that.
But then you never,
I've never,

937
00:55:44.391 --> 00:55:47.060
no one's ever gonna say,
Joe Rogan's Bossy.
Well,
don't,
I don't,

938
00:55:47.061 --> 00:55:50.000
no one wants to be called bossy.
Not going to say like,
he's like a survey.

939
00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:53.720
But if say I was Bossy,
I'd be like,
okay,
well maybe I'm doing something wrong.

940
00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:54.930
You know,

941
00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:58.690
like a lot of times people get carried away or get caught up in there the

942
00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:01.790
momentum of their own behavior and don't even realize how they're acting.

943
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:04.370
Someone has to tell you,
hey,
you're being bossy.
And you know,
oh,

944
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:08.050
but they don't say that about guys.
Like they can say the guys,

945
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:12.140
he's a dick or he's overbearing or whatever,
but a woman becomes bossy.

946
00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:13.670
But then she was going on about it.

947
00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:18.850
We should encourage men to not work and take the role of child rearing and let

948
00:56:18.951 --> 00:56:20.870
the women work.
And I was like,
okay,
this bitch is crazy.

949
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:25.810
It's like this whole men and women.
It's like,
it was personal.
I think it was,

950
00:56:25.811 --> 00:56:30.280
I think it was her own trip that she was like trying to like make it more normal

951
00:56:30.281 --> 00:56:32.200
for men to do that,

952
00:56:32.201 --> 00:56:36.790
to be the one who takes care of the children and we should encourage this and I

953
00:56:36.791 --> 00:56:39.310
don't think you should encourage it one way or the other.
You know,

954
00:56:39.311 --> 00:56:41.720
I think there's going to be a bunch of people that liked that.
This,

955
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:46.030
I know a guy who's of a mom,
his,
his wife works all the time.

956
00:56:46.031 --> 00:56:49.480
She's like a high powered executive,
but she's fucking miserable.

957
00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:52.120
She works all the time.
And the,
the,
the husband's always like,

958
00:56:52.121 --> 00:56:54.280
let's go on vacation.
And I'm like,
she makes a ton of money.

959
00:56:54.281 --> 00:56:57.550
He doesn't make Jack Shit.
Yeah.
He's a very bright guy too.
He's a professor,

960
00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.940
but he like teaches like one class rides his bike everywhere.

961
00:57:00.941 --> 00:57:05.240
He's a fucking total hippie and she's fucking winding.
Yeah.

962
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.900
Every day.
And they make tons of money,
but it's not on him.

963
00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.890
It's a weird dynamic one.
Whenever we're all together,
I'm like,
what?

964
00:57:13.891 --> 00:57:15.400
This fucking relationship is so odd.

965
00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.690
<v 3>I mean,
it's interesting.
I was talking to this,
um,</v>

966
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:23.010
neuro anthropologist hollow hollow.
He,
um,
you would like him actually.

967
00:57:23.011 --> 00:57:27.600
So I'm in this project that I'm doing has a lot of like sort of experts in it,

968
00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:32.430
like project,
it's a pilot for HBO where I have instead of like a,
you know,

969
00:57:32.431 --> 00:57:34.710
a friend who's like the exposition friend who's like,

970
00:57:34.711 --> 00:57:38.040
you know what you should do,
you should get a makeover.
I instead have,
um,

971
00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:40.620
you know,
people,
Ted talk people and you know,

972
00:57:40.621 --> 00:57:43.890
Malcolm Gladwell and Michael Morin ner anthropologists and neurologists come in

973
00:57:43.891 --> 00:57:46.620
and sort of explain what's happening because I think a lot of us sort of our

974
00:57:46.621 --> 00:57:47.750
pretending,
uh,

975
00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:52.470
or are misinformed thinking that we have choices and all of the decisions we

976
00:57:52.471 --> 00:57:56.550
make when so much of it is our primal reptilian brain just running the show and

977
00:57:56.551 --> 00:58:01.470
human nature taking over.
And we like feminism.
Like,
of course I'm pro feminism,

978
00:58:01.471 --> 00:58:06.450
but human nature and evolution of neurology doesn't catch up as fast as social

979
00:58:06.451 --> 00:58:11.070
progress does.
You know?
So a lot of this is against some level of human nature.

980
00:58:11.310 --> 00:58:14.880
So I was asking him if he thought humans,
we're inherently a matriarch.

981
00:58:14.881 --> 00:58:18.330
You're patriarchy.
And what animals are a patriarchy in which our matriarchy,

982
00:58:18.331 --> 00:58:22.170
so like lions are pretty much major article in terms of they sort of do all the

983
00:58:22.171 --> 00:58:25.010
work and the male lions sleep 22 hours a day.
Right.

984
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:28.930
<v 1>Sort of.
But the male lines are much larger in the male lions protect the pride.</v>

985
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:32.830
Yes.
The real matriarchal societies.
Hyenas.
Hyenas,
yeah.
Yeah.

986
00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:37.660
And Bonobo apes,
the females have faked dicks.
No.
Yes,

987
00:58:37.661 --> 00:58:40.990
they have a pho penis.
They have an actual penis and they give birth out of it.

988
00:58:40.991 --> 00:58:44.530
It's an enormous penis.
And they mount the male.
So the only mammals,

989
00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:48.570
females are larger than the males.
Well,
and it's because life is a heinous,

990
00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:51.580
so ruthless that male hyenas were regularly eat the babies.

991
00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:55.080
So to keep them from eating the babies,
the woman or the gangster be bigger.
Yeah.

992
00:58:55.081 --> 00:58:58.270
A bigger and stronger.
And they've dominate the men and fuck them,

993
00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:00.800
they fucked them with their giant fake dicks.

994
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:05.950
Um,
uh,
that's the happiest I've ever seen.
You,
by the way,

995
00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:10.630
explaining that and glean a real problem with wildlife.

996
00:59:10.631 --> 00:59:12.160
I fucking love it.
Love

997
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:15.280
<v 3>it.
But it's also what,
what does patriarchal mean and what does matriarchal me,</v>

998
00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:18.370
maybe it does it mean physically bigger?
Does it mean the ones,
so you know,

999
00:59:18.371 --> 00:59:21.620
the female lions doing the hunting,
the male lion is pretty much the boss.
They,

1000
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:23.840
you know,
call the shots in are like bigger,

1001
00:59:23.841 --> 00:59:27.140
but they have to sleep most of the time to preserve their energy and it's not

1002
00:59:27.141 --> 00:59:31.730
economical for the them to be up and running around.
Um,
Bonobo Apes,

1003
00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.360
the women sort of call the shots in terms of who kills who and who's in charge

1004
00:59:35.361 --> 00:59:37.430
and they're sort of like,
have the resources and stuff.

1005
00:59:37.431 --> 00:59:41.540
And because there are a guy knock cracy,
is that what it's called?

1006
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:45.620
They use their vagina's too.
You know,
like if someone's pissed off,
they fuck up.

1007
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:47.110
Yes.
A Guy,
Nah.
Ocracy interest.

1008
00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:50.450
So they use sex to sort of placate and to get what they want.

1009
00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:54.890
And I want it for yes,
essentially.
Exactly.
And so is that,

1010
00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:58.940
you know,
and in humans we would say that's a weakness and that's,
you know,

1011
00:59:58.941 --> 01:00:01.940
you're being
fucking standard.

1012
01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:04.560
You're using what you have to make it as me.
Um,

1013
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.540
so we were talking about that and he sort of was making a strong argument that

1014
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:14.530
humans could have a inherent matriarchal traits that we,

1015
01:00:14.901 --> 01:00:19.240
um,
you know,
oh,
press.
Yeah.

1016
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:23.060
Just in terms of like,
you know,
if,
you know,
what does power mean?

1017
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:24.260
And you know,

1018
01:00:24.261 --> 01:00:28.220
men are sort of designed to do the hunting and the killing and the protecting

1019
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:32.420
and were sort of designed to do all the organizing and all of the like real shit

1020
01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:35.620
work.
But we're not sort of allowed to do that a lot in this society.
So it's just

1021
01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:42.380
primal organizing,
raising the kids,
making decisions about allowed to,

1022
01:00:42.381 --> 01:00:47.160
you don't think so?
Well,
I don't know.
I mean,
it's,
it's,
I think that we're,
um,
uh,

1023
01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.590
criticized a lot when we do what we do best at,
you know,

1024
01:00:51.591 --> 01:00:55.490
we're called crazy and neurotic and obsessive and she's obsessed with getting

1025
01:00:55.491 --> 01:00:58.670
married and nesting in the house.
And she wants to change the carpet.

1026
01:00:58.671 --> 01:01:00.520
It's like that's what we're wired very much.

1027
01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:03.820
<v 2>Didn't do the way men,
the reason why men will criticize that,</v>

1028
01:01:03.821 --> 01:01:05.840
it's because they don't understand those instincts like mine,

1029
01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.080
my wife takes care of everything.
She's,

1030
01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:10.690
she's the one who's like responsible for all the,

1031
01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:14.230
like if you go to my house you'd be like,
Oh,
this is even your fucking house.

1032
01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.790
Some chicks house.
Like I have a few rooms in my house that her mine.
Yeah,

1033
01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:19.480
clearly.
Yeah.
But most of the houses,

1034
01:01:19.481 --> 01:01:23.390
my wife's designed and all her shit and she just let her,
but I,

1035
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:27.160
I'm my market because I don't understand it.
I'll make fun of it.
But it's,

1036
01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:30.530
<v 3>and I think what I should mention is I think that women are shamed for that more</v>

1037
01:01:30.531 --> 01:01:31.730
than men shaming women.

1038
01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.760
I think that there's this thing now where if you're like great at organizing the

1039
01:01:34.761 --> 01:01:37.530
house and cooking and cleaning,
like you're not a feminist.
It's like,
well

1040
01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.680
<v 2>I hate that word.
I don't like the word feminist.
So loaded.
It's so loaded.</v>

1041
01:01:41.681 --> 01:01:44.200
And it's not that I don't like the quality,
I just don't like,

1042
01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:46.390
there's so many hashtag feminists,

1043
01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:49.510
there's so many people that there's people that I,
I'm obsessed with.

1044
01:01:49.511 --> 01:01:50.700
I go to their Twitter page.
Do you,

1045
01:01:50.701 --> 01:01:54.610
cause every fucking post they make is about gender.
It's like the,

1046
01:01:54.611 --> 01:01:56.860
most of their identity is based on feminism.

1047
01:01:56.861 --> 01:02:00.070
There's a giant chunk of what they do and they think they're being activists.

1048
01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.113
But you're not

1049
01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:05.040
<v 3>a lot of feminists are a lot of feminism doesn't mean being equal.</v>

1050
01:02:05.041 --> 01:02:07.410
It means women should be superior.
It's like,
wait a second.

1051
01:02:07.411 --> 01:02:10.050
I thought the goal was that we were supposed to be superior at,

1052
01:02:10.051 --> 01:02:13.260
which means that we should equally be judged and criticized and all these other

1053
01:02:13.261 --> 01:02:15.060
things that it can't be like,
I'm going to speak out,

1054
01:02:15.061 --> 01:02:19.700
but you're not allowed to attack me or question anything.
I said,
you're a right.

1055
01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:22.710
If you question anything I say,
it's like,
no.
Um,

1056
01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:24.660
so I think that is a very tricky place and I'm,

1057
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:28.560
I'm working on this thing that's sort of about how our primal neurology,

1058
01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.500
like what annoys you about your wife today?
Not You,

1059
01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:34.110
particularly Joe or whatever it was.
I know.
Again,

1060
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:37.980
I wouldn't noise you about your boyfriend today is what kept you alive 2000

1061
01:02:37.981 --> 01:02:38.730
years ago.

1062
01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:42.060
So I essentially all the things that are not your girl going through your cell

1063
01:02:42.061 --> 01:02:42.930
phone today,

1064
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.730
2000 years ago was her surveying land for tigers and threats.
You know,

1065
01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:49.770
today it just manifests in going through your cell phone.

1066
01:02:49.771 --> 01:02:53.810
Are Your threats to the chest?
Yeah,
there's,
we have street lights now,
right?

1067
01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:55.770
We have alarm systems.
We don't that,
you know,

1068
01:02:55.771 --> 01:02:59.070
you don't need to be looking for paw prints cause there was a tiger around.

1069
01:02:59.071 --> 01:03:01.530
You need to be like checking the cell phone and going through his computer on

1070
01:03:01.531 --> 01:03:03.180
his emails.
You know,
that's the same impulse.

1071
01:03:03.181 --> 01:03:06.050
We're not just going to evolve overnight to catch up with cell phones and street

1072
01:03:06.051 --> 01:03:06.560
lights.

1073
01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.690
<v 2>Well there's just so many classic there.</v>

1074
01:03:08.691 --> 01:03:12.620
There's so many classic stereotypes when it comes to,
to,
to gender roles.

1075
01:03:12.621 --> 01:03:14.510
And one of my favorites is the feminist.

1076
01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:17.960
That's a always concerned with rape and they constantly have all these,

1077
01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:21.440
these rape,
uh,
tweets and rape awareness.

1078
01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:25.580
And then you look at them and they're morbidly obese and they have pink hair and

1079
01:03:25.581 --> 01:03:29.750
you're like,
well,
what's going on here?
Like what,
why is your entire existence?

1080
01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.960
Why is he so much of your thoughts?
What have your,

1081
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:35.120
whatever you're projecting online.
So much of it is about gender.

1082
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:39.050
And then they mock men.
Like there's all this Mra mocking.

1083
01:03:39.051 --> 01:03:41.750
Like someone called me an Mra and I literally had to Google it because I didn't

1084
01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:44.120
know what it meant is that men's rights advocate.

1085
01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:48.920
So feminists who mock men who want rights,
which is hilarious.

1086
01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:52.700
It's above her.
Well,
let me say so like loaded.
It's all so loaded.

1087
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:57.180
<v 3>No.
So loaded.
And it's the,
we all the few um,</v>

1088
01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.900
radical ones give everyone a bad name.
It's like,

1089
01:03:59.901 --> 01:04:03.740
does every football player beat up his girlfriend?
No.
Ray Rice did.
So we,

1090
01:04:03.741 --> 01:04:04.960
now it's in the zeitgeists.

1091
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.911
<v 2>Well,
I have this woman,</v>

1092
01:04:05.911 --> 01:04:08.840
Christina Summers on my podcast a couple of weeks ago and she calls herself the

1093
01:04:08.841 --> 01:04:13.460
factual feminist and she's an older woman who grew up as a feminist in a time

1094
01:04:13.461 --> 01:04:15.320
where she believes that it had a different meaning.

1095
01:04:15.321 --> 01:04:17.180
And it was a true search for quality,

1096
01:04:17.181 --> 01:04:21.110
but now she thinks that it's been sort of hijacked with fake facts and bias

1097
01:04:21.111 --> 01:04:25.820
statistics and a bunch of studies that aren't really based on reality.

1098
01:04:25.821 --> 01:04:29.990
And she,
she read confronts them and she's like,
this is bad for feminism.

1099
01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:32.840
When you go around saying that women make 75 cents on the dollar,

1100
01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:35.720
this is bad for feminism because what you're not talking about is,
well,

1101
01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:37.250
what are the jobs they choose?

1102
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:40.330
And this is the difference between the jobs they choose.
They,

1103
01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.570
they're not as dangerous.

1104
01:04:41.571 --> 01:04:46.340
They don't when they do the same jobs that the difference in pay is very
similar.

1105
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:48.010
Yeah.
Like this.
So this is,

1106
01:04:48.011 --> 01:04:51.560
these are disingenuous comparisons and these statistics are biased and,
okay.

1107
01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:52.520
<v 3>Agreed.
And I think that,
you know,</v>

1108
01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:56.180
I talked to Maureen Dowd wrote this article or two weekends ago in the New York

1109
01:04:56.181 --> 01:04:59.570
Times about less women in Hollywood and less women directors on that kind of

1110
01:04:59.571 --> 01:05:02.180
stuff.
And I think that my sort of point,

1111
01:05:02.181 --> 01:05:04.580
and she's a friend of mine and we're working on something together,

1112
01:05:04.581 --> 01:05:06.650
but I think my point when people ask me about like,

1113
01:05:06.651 --> 01:05:08.900
what do you think about less women directors in Hollywood?
And I'm like,

1114
01:05:09.110 --> 01:05:11.690
no one is talking about all the offers we get that we pass on.

1115
01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.250
So no women in late night,

1116
01:05:13.251 --> 01:05:16.670
you think that they wouldn't make a show with Amy Poehler right now is the host

1117
01:05:16.671 --> 01:05:17.600
of a late show,
right?

1118
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.050
<v 0>They don't cover the women that pass.</v>

1119
01:05:20.051 --> 01:05:22.570
Amy Schumer was offered the daily show when she passed.
Right.

1120
01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.600
No one talks about that.

1121
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:27.100
So it's like I've been offered direct movies and I am directing maybe next year,

1122
01:05:27.101 --> 01:05:30.580
but I've said no because it's just not something that I really want to do.

1123
01:05:30.581 --> 01:05:32.740
Why are there less female comedians?
It's like,
I mean,

1124
01:05:32.741 --> 01:05:34.390
now I feel like there's not as much,
but it's like,

1125
01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:36.400
because the lifestyle is fucking stressful.

1126
01:05:36.401 --> 01:05:38.770
It's the same reason we might not have our own football league because we don't

1127
01:05:38.771 --> 01:05:41.800
want to play a sport where we have to put a helmet on.
It's just like,
you know,

1128
01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:44.620
so I think it's a harder gig for a woman stand up.

1129
01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:49.270
I think name one female comedian who's married with kids.
I can't,

1130
01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:55.030
um,
there was,
there were wanting macfarlane.
Oh yeah,
there you go.
That's right.

1131
01:05:55.031 --> 01:05:58.390
But she's married to a comedian and she gets to open for him on the road and

1132
01:05:58.391 --> 01:05:59.920
they pass the baby back and forth,
like

1133
01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:08.800
comedian soccer,
football.
So that kid probably hits the ground.
She's a child now.

1134
01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:12.730
They get to do it together and then you have a great relationship.
Yes.

1135
01:06:12.731 --> 01:06:15.780
You're funny together.
Yes.
And she's very talented as well.

1136
01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:19.810
It's a good point.
It's a very good point.
I haven't like,
I mean,

1137
01:06:19.811 --> 01:06:23.560
I even struggled if I kept female comedians who have like good relationships are

1138
01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:24.720
kind of stable relationships.

1139
01:06:24.721 --> 01:06:26.620
So it's not like it's the same thing that you were talking about.

1140
01:06:26.621 --> 01:06:30.400
It's hard to find a guy who can deal with a woman that's got a strong

1141
01:06:30.401 --> 01:06:34.900
personality.
You want to see my stamina?
What?
No Way.

1142
01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.870
No fucking way.
I don't let them come see me.
Nope.

1143
01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.310
Nope.
It's like,
it's like my dirty little secret.
It's like I'm cheating.

1144
01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.680
I'm literally will be like cheating on the guy and with with stand up,
I'm like,

1145
01:06:47.681 --> 01:06:48.550
I'm gonna run to Starbucks.

1146
01:06:48.551 --> 01:06:52.080
Then I'll like go do a set of the comedy store and come home.
Wow.
I will not lie.

1147
01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:54.190
I will not let the guy I'm dating see it.

1148
01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.570
We should probably talk about all this off stage.
I think you,
uh,
there's,
there's,

1149
01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:02.800
there's work arounds.
I Dunno.
Maybe it's just the wrong guy,

1150
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:08.590
but I think that it's true.
You know what?
So who else said that to me?

1151
01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:12.700
It might've been callin.
Actually I do date the I am fine.

1152
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:15.550
I'm a yes,
like a chauvinist.

1153
01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:19.620
I was dating like professional athletes and like male models.
Well that's why,

1154
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:23.280
you know,
I said I used to word frantic,
energetic.
There's two,

1155
01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:28.240
you've got too much.
Like a lot of men,

1156
01:07:28.241 --> 01:07:31.030
you know,
they just don't,
they're not going to match that.
You know?

1157
01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:35.230
And sometimes when,
when you see like when people,
like if they hate it,

1158
01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.190
they hate on someone.

1159
01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:39.730
There's a lot of people that hate on like Kevin Hart or someone like that.

1160
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:41.560
Why is he getting a backlash?

1161
01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:48.970
We saw ambitious,
ambitious,
ambitious,
and he makes you feel lazy.

1162
01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.660
Like I'm ambitious and I see Kevin Hart,
I'm like,
I might be lazy.
Yeah.

1163
01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:54.130
I might be lazy in comparison to him.

1164
01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:57.160
I mean it's really what successful people do,
right?

1165
01:07:57.161 --> 01:07:59.470
As they just sort of eliminate our insecurities about ourselves.

1166
01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:03.610
They hold a mirror up to what we don't have a lot of people,

1167
01:08:03.611 --> 01:08:07.920
they don't do well with that and instead they started attacking that mirror.
Yes.

1168
01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:11.080
Yes.
And I heard a quote a long time ago that stuck with me,

1169
01:08:11.081 --> 01:08:14.200
which is that comparison is the worst form of violence against yourself.

1170
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.980
And it's one that,
I know

1171
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.290
<v 3>you're probably not a big quotes like inspirational quote person,</v>

1172
01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:20.780
but that's one that I stick to whenever I get stuck in the heat.

1173
01:08:20.781 --> 01:08:22.690
She's got this and I don't,
and she did this and I did and,

1174
01:08:22.691 --> 01:08:24.490
and I'm falling behind and all that sort of,

1175
01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:27.580
<v 1>that's a good way to look at it because instead you should look at it.</v>

1176
01:08:27.581 --> 01:08:30.940
It like fuel that uncomfortable feeling that you get when you see someone

1177
01:08:30.941 --> 01:08:34.540
kicking ass.
Yeah.
You're supposed to go kick some ass.
Yeah.
Go,
go home and write.

1178
01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:39.700
Exactly.
Go workout.
Go.
Yeah.
They have the same 24 hours,
you know,
we do.

1179
01:08:39.790 --> 01:08:42.370
Presumably.
And that's how you get better.
Yeah.

1180
01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.730
Like you don't get better because you're the shit like,

1181
01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:47.470
and you're better than everybody.
Like Ah,
wow.
Why would I even try?

1182
01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:50.190
Like those days are gone.
That doesn't exist anymore.

1183
01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.750
There's not this one genius that comes down from the mountain with all the great

1184
01:08:52.751 --> 01:08:56.720
ideas.
No.
You have to be surrounded by other people that also have amazing ideas.

1185
01:08:56.830 --> 01:08:58.180
Yes.
Each other.

1186
01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:02.590
<v 3>I mean,
it's tricky because I feel like when I hear the word ambitious,</v>

1187
01:09:02.591 --> 01:09:05.470
maybe it's to your point about the word bossy and the disruptive leadership

1188
01:09:05.471 --> 01:09:09.670
thing.
I feel like when we say a woman is ambitious,
there's this weird,
um,

1189
01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:12.670
stink on that word.
Like it gives me like a little bit of,

1190
01:09:12.671 --> 01:09:15.820
it makes me recoil a tiny bit cause it makes,
I don't know why,

1191
01:09:15.821 --> 01:09:18.430
it's like kind of a dirty word when people say I'm ambitious,

1192
01:09:18.431 --> 01:09:21.430
I get uncomfortable.
Um,
but I think for me,

1193
01:09:21.431 --> 01:09:24.040
I noticed recently I'm third just turned 33.

1194
01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:27.220
I don't need to be famous.

1195
01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.700
Like that's not something that like I need or I realized that I want,

1196
01:09:30.701 --> 01:09:34.030
I think in the beginning I was like,
oh,
I was not seen and heard as a child.

1197
01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:36.010
All I want to do is be seen and heard.

1198
01:09:36.310 --> 01:09:40.560
And then in the last like three years is I've like done some like work on myself

1199
01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.830
and woken up.
I'm not like,

1200
01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:47.490
like just flying through space unconsciously the way I used to now that's made

1201
01:09:48.221 --> 01:09:50.500
things very clear for me in terms of when I wake up in the morning,

1202
01:09:50.501 --> 01:09:55.270
what my goals are and how I,
I just want to be good.
I don't want to be famous.

1203
01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:58.840
And that makes my life a lot more sort of chill.

1204
01:09:58.841 --> 01:10:01.930
And I also think that if I had a relationship with kids,
I wouldn't work as hard.

1205
01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:03.920
It's just I don't have kids.
Right.
You know,

1206
01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.600
<v 1>when you say you want to be good,
what,
what,
what do you define that by?
D Dee.</v>

1207
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.690
Good.
With your standup?
Yeah.
Yeah,

1208
01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.020
that's pretty much every good standup that I know.

1209
01:10:13.021 --> 01:10:17.190
And I think you're very funny by the way.
Every person like you.

1210
01:10:17.191 --> 01:10:20.370
Anyone that's good.
That's pretty much the most important thing.
Like,
you know,

1211
01:10:20.371 --> 01:10:23.130
I do a lot of different shit,
but if anybody ever said,
all right Joe,

1212
01:10:23.131 --> 01:10:26.040
you have to pick one only one thing.
It wouldn't even be,

1213
01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:28.470
there's not even a thing.
It's,
there's no thought.

1214
01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:31.710
Like I could always enjoy conversations with people without putting them in a

1215
01:10:31.711 --> 01:10:35.280
podcast.
Yeah.
I can always enjoy watching the UFC without being a commentator.

1216
01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:38.970
Yeah.
Yeah.
But w what would you do for free for an occupation?
What,

1217
01:10:38.971 --> 01:10:41.070
would you still do it for free or do you stand up for failure?

1218
01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:44.250
I don't think I've ever gotten paid to do stand up.
Actually,
I have to lose that.

1219
01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:48.540
Honestly.
I've never picked up one of my $50 jives with the comment.
Sorry,

1220
01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:51.240
I don't pick a mommy picked him up.
Yeah.
Tommy probably ate them

1221
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:55.590
fucking creep.
But I,
uh,
I think that,

1222
01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:59.940
<v 3>you know,
for the first time,
and I'm curious when you know you're good cause no,</v>

1223
01:10:59.941 --> 01:11:03.540
I mean no comedian,
it's comes off stage and he's like crushed it.

1224
01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:07.200
We're always just like,
I shouldn't,
I shouldn't suck,
suck,
you know?

1225
01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:12.210
And so I know that my last two specials,
I can't even,
why can't I cringe?

1226
01:11:12.211 --> 01:11:12.931
Even thinking about them,

1227
01:11:12.931 --> 01:11:15.210
it's looking at a photo of yourself in the 80s with what you were wearing.

1228
01:11:15.211 --> 01:11:19.740
Your just like,
Oh God.
Like this last one is the first time I wasn't like,

1229
01:11:19.741 --> 01:11:21.150
this is great.
It's the first time I was like,

1230
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:24.110
<v 2>okay,
like I that was,
well,</v>

1231
01:11:24.111 --> 01:11:27.620
it's so hard because it's so close to it.
You're there with it all the time.

1232
01:11:27.621 --> 01:11:29.840
So none of those jokes were surprising to you.
Nope.

1233
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:32.810
None of those jokes sneak up on you.
And that's what comedy is all about.

1234
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:35.600
Comedy is all about like you have an idea,

1235
01:11:35.601 --> 01:11:40.010
you start with a premise and then you say something in that premise.

1236
01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.100
Like when you say if you start talking about um,

1237
01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:45.380
a clock and you started doing a bit about a clock,

1238
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:47.000
you're doing a bit about the clock.
I'm like,
okay,

1239
01:11:47.001 --> 01:11:50.210
we're talking about clocks and then you surprise me with some shit.
I'm like,
ah,

1240
01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:52.100
that's half of what comedy is.

1241
01:11:52.101 --> 01:11:56.210
And that's not available to you because you were saying,
and I know the tree no,

1242
01:11:56.211 --> 01:11:58.130
the trick.
So it's so hard to like,

1243
01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:01.700
and also you're so close to it because you're chipping away on it and the only

1244
01:12:01.701 --> 01:12:06.680
way to be good is to be like constantly introspective and constantly objective

1245
01:12:06.681 --> 01:12:10.910
and constantly analytical and it's fucking brutal.
It beats you down.

1246
01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:15.000
<v 3>I just know that if I know that this last one I taped on tape night,</v>

1247
01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:20.300
I still kind of giggled at some of the con I still cared.

1248
01:12:20.401 --> 01:12:22.890
I still gave a shit about what I was talking about.
I wasn't phoning it in,

1249
01:12:22.891 --> 01:12:26.820
I wasn't rote just saying something I had said 600 times and I was like,

1250
01:12:26.821 --> 01:12:31.290
I still felt this sense of like I'm saying something I care about,

1251
01:12:31.291 --> 01:12:32.510
which to me is all I can ask.

1252
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:36.230
<v 2>That's the key,
right?
To be in the moment while you're talking about the subject,</v>

1253
01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:37.910
<v 3>right.
It,
you film it and your later,</v>

1254
01:12:37.911 --> 01:12:42.860
if a year later it's still relevant to you or matters.
It's like,
okay,

1255
01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:43.750
that I've succeeded.

1256
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:47.290
<v 2>Do you,
this is my thought about standup and tell me if you agree.</v>

1257
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:50.980
I think that when you're,
when you're on,
like everything's going great.

1258
01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.610
The audience is laughing really loud.
You know,
it's like everyone's tuned in.

1259
01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:58.780
I feel like it's a form of hypnosis.
Yes.
It feels now

1260
01:12:59.000 --> 01:12:59.780
<v 3>interesting and I don't,</v>

1261
01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:03.260
and I'm actually not bringing this up because of your occupation,

1262
01:13:03.261 --> 01:13:07.190
but I think it is very,
standup is very much a sport for me.
Um,

1263
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:10.070
I agree that it's hypnosis.
Yes.
It's very,
it's like,
to me,

1264
01:13:10.071 --> 01:13:11.060
the only things I compare it to,

1265
01:13:11.061 --> 01:13:14.240
or like sex and boxing because you can't be a second ahead.

1266
01:13:14.241 --> 01:13:18.470
You can't be a second behind the other.
The audience is 50% of it.

1267
01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:22.040
I can't just do 90% it's like what I do next.

1268
01:13:22.041 --> 01:13:25.460
It depends on what you just did and it does become the very like hypnotic

1269
01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:26.820
symphonic.

1270
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:31.220
<v 2>Well,
that's why hecklers don't realize what a fucking disaster they are.</v>

1271
01:13:31.221 --> 01:13:33.350
Like how they're fucking things up because you're,

1272
01:13:33.351 --> 01:13:35.810
you're fucking up the rhythm of the interaction.

1273
01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:39.830
Like all of a sudden you have reared you're ugly head and now everything has to

1274
01:13:39.831 --> 01:13:43.850
focus on you and the whole trance has been transformed.

1275
01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:46.750
<v 3>Yes,
totally.
And you've truncated this like vibe.</v>

1276
01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:51.630
I am not encouraging this because if I talk about this,
maybe I'll get increased.

1277
01:13:51.631 --> 01:13:52.510
The amount of hecklers I get,

1278
01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:55.240
I sometimes like hecklers because they keep me awake.

1279
01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:57.830
<v 2>You don't fall asleep at the wheel.</v>

1280
01:13:57.831 --> 01:14:00.770
Sometimes I fall asleep at the wheel to do a lot of sets.
Is that what it is?

1281
01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:02.570
<v 3>Yeah.
When I'm getting ready for a special,</v>

1282
01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:04.430
I'm like good at like trying to time it out.

1283
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:09.140
I'm very embarrassed about this and I have shame around it but I won't write it

1284
01:14:09.141 --> 01:14:12.070
out in the word document and I'm a geek.
I record

1285
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:15.970
<v 0>every set and I do the same set and time it out and have four new tags I'm going</v>

1286
01:14:15.971 --> 01:14:16.311
to try.

1287
01:14:16.311 --> 01:14:20.530
I try wanted each show like I'm not a savant that gets up on stage and just

1288
01:14:20.531 --> 01:14:24.190
writes on stage.
I wish I was that person.
I wish I could pretend like,

1289
01:14:24.191 --> 01:14:27.880
I just wish that though I feel like there's shame and maybe this is just like a

1290
01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:30.490
high school attitude.
But in comedy there's still that,

1291
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.650
you know the person that gets an f is cool.

1292
01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:36.070
Like the person who tries the least is the coolest.
Wow.
That's so weird.

1293
01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:38.500
That's because you come from athlete.
I,

1294
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:43.920
I feel like people think I'm a nerd because I try so hard and it's so fucking

1295
01:14:44.291 --> 01:14:46.630
strange.
Really ought to be a woman thing.

1296
01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:49.420
Maybe suppression of the ambitious woman.

1297
01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:53.470
Cause I literally have like all my jokes typed out in a word document.

1298
01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:56.050
I'd come to the comedy store,
just pretend like I'm winging it and I'm like wow,

1299
01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:59.200
I don't know what I'm going to do.
Gives me shit for having a notebook sometimes

1300
01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:05.660
to shame a man for like preparing.
That's so good.

1301
01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:09.140
Well that's why you're you and he's,
I write shit out.

1302
01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.300
Two of my favorite things to tell.

1303
01:15:10.301 --> 01:15:13.570
I remember one time cause you know what tell has a new hour every six months and

1304
01:15:13.571 --> 01:15:16.270
he was like writing in his composition but before a show and I can't remember

1305
01:15:16.271 --> 01:15:19.420
what comedian come up to him.
You know,
some middle guy was like,

1306
01:15:19.421 --> 01:15:22.140
what are you doing?
What are you writing joke?
Or what are you doing?

1307
01:15:22.141 --> 01:15:26.290
And at a tug goes,
I'm writing jokes.
Ever heard of it?
And it was just,
you know,

1308
01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:29.860
not particularly funny,
but she's just so like,
yeah,
the greats write shit down.

1309
01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:33.870
Try Greg Giraldo and Denis leary going at it

1310
01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.320
the fucking best.
First of all,

1311
01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:41.440
Dennis is sitting there and a leather jacket.

1312
01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:47.440
He's got sunglasses on inside during the filming.

1313
01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.310
Everything's going great for him.

1314
01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:54.040
He's on top of the world and Geraldo keeps coming up with these funny lines and

1315
01:15:54.041 --> 01:15:56.620
then he goes to this guy,
he's always got lines.
He goes,
yeah,
Dennis,

1316
01:15:56.621 --> 01:15:59.890
this is a common,
should we write?
We write down how many writers?
Yes.

1317
01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:03.460
Oh my gosh.
Gosh,
I don't even have a TV show.

1318
01:16:03.461 --> 01:16:05.900
What's your show has actually had a show Dennis canceled.

1319
01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:09.970
Mark Marin made fun of me one time about that too.

1320
01:16:09.971 --> 01:16:13.900
Like I was on his podcast and he was like,
uh,
he's like,

1321
01:16:13.901 --> 01:16:18.040
you like write jokes,
you do like jokes.
And I remember being like,

1322
01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:22.660
I'm so,
can we,
I don't,
we isn't that what we're doing here?

1323
01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:25.870
Like I was saying that alternative community,

1324
01:16:25.871 --> 01:16:30.250
it's very looked down upon to have like debt to bad punchline set up punchline.

1325
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:35.280
He was trying to say that that's a bad thing.
I annoy mark very much.
Why?

1326
01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:40.240
Just the fact that I like have jokes and write jokes and prepare and like come

1327
01:16:40.241 --> 01:16:44.500
on,
guy has jokes he writes,
Joe does,
but it's a little more,

1328
01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.560
it feels more unscripted and extemporaneous and like an inner monologue.

1329
01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:55.320
Just he's,
you know,
naturally funny or something and I'm not,

1330
01:16:56.530 --> 01:17:00.910
I'm not,
not extemporaneously funny.
I have to work.
I'm a geek.

1331
01:17:00.911 --> 01:17:04.970
I have to be a geek.
I feel like there's both things.

1332
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:09.310
I think there's benefit in free balling and trying to come up with things and

1333
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:10.100
Improv,

1334
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:14.390
<v 2>improvising and exploring the bits.
Like,
a lot of times I'll set myself up,</v>

1335
01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.850
like I'll dig a hole on stage,

1336
01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:21.110
on purpose and then try to fight my way out of the hole.
And sometimes I don't.

1337
01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:23.970
And that that opens a door to headquarters for sure.
Yeah.
You know,

1338
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:27.980
but you've got to deal with that,
you know?
Um,
but this,
in that process,

1339
01:17:27.981 --> 01:17:31.070
like sometimes bits come out,
but I also write,

1340
01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:33.260
I sit in front of the fucking keyboard all the time.

1341
01:17:33.261 --> 01:17:36.890
I sit in front of a notepad all the time and I feel like if I don't do that,

1342
01:17:36.891 --> 01:17:39.620
there are bits that won't emerge.
They just won't.

1343
01:17:39.690 --> 01:17:43.470
<v 3>Nope.
And amount of write them down.
I'll forget them.
And I just,
I was always,</v>

1344
01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:47.250
you know,
people always,
people always.
But when people ever,
people say I'm smart,

1345
01:17:47.251 --> 01:17:52.170
I get so confused because I got smart because I was not smart enough.

1346
01:17:52.171 --> 01:17:54.810
I was always in the kid in class asking a million questions and taking a
million.

1347
01:17:54.811 --> 01:17:58.200
Now it's like I work.
So had to overcompensate for the fact that I wasn't smart.

1348
01:17:58.201 --> 01:18:02.790
That that's how I,
I think smart's a loaded word too.
It's a very vague nebulous,

1349
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:04.480
it's a nothing word.
Yeah.

1350
01:18:05.230 --> 01:18:06.240
<v 2>Well what do you know?
Like it's,</v>

1351
01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:09.310
it's accumulation of information is not necessarily intelligence.

1352
01:18:09.311 --> 01:18:11.390
Like there's some people that will say they'll,

1353
01:18:11.391 --> 01:18:15.790
they'll try to equate the two together and I think you can learn things you

1354
01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:18.600
remember things doesn't necessarily mean you're smart.
You get out of your hands.

1355
01:18:18.710 --> 01:18:20.760
<v 3>Wait Shit.
I,
there's difference between being,</v>

1356
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:24.920
like you're articulate and like you're smart and that way,

1357
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:29.180
like I just read a lot of shit and spouting out facts doesn't make you smart.

1358
01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:32.980
<v 2>That's the same thing I do.
I just bout shit out that I remember.
Yeah.</v>

1359
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:36.650
<v 3>Right.
I'm not smart.
I'm plagiarizing someone else that I just read.
Exactly.</v>

1360
01:18:36.651 --> 01:18:39.110
I'm busy.
I just set a percentage.
And you think I'm smart.

1361
01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:41.280
<v 2>I mean I'm smart about certain things.</v>

1362
01:18:41.281 --> 01:18:43.050
Like if you want to ask me about martial arts,

1363
01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:44.800
I know a lot about it because I've studied it,

1364
01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:49.770
<v 3>but you're insightful and intuitive and the,
you know,</v>

1365
01:18:49.771 --> 01:18:52.110
like an artist when it comes to that kind of stuff.

1366
01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:54.180
You're a brilliant with that stuff.
Well thank you.

1367
01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.990
Cause you have like a sixth sense.
You,
you know,
that's a magical,
yeah,

1368
01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:00.760
<v 2>it's not a sixth sense.
It's just I've been doing it so long.</v>

1369
01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.290
It's just data chunking.

1370
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:04.380
<v 3>Well it's like when people,
um,
you know,</v>

1371
01:19:04.381 --> 01:19:06.960
and not to demystify sort of what we do or pull the curtain back too much,

1372
01:19:06.961 --> 01:19:08.970
when people are like,
you're so good with hecklers.
It's like,

1373
01:19:08.971 --> 01:19:10.260
well there's no heckler.

1374
01:19:10.261 --> 01:19:14.970
I haven't encountered any exchange I have with a Heckler I've done 500 times.

1375
01:19:14.971 --> 01:19:16.740
So at hecklers,
like,
hey bitch.

1376
01:19:16.741 --> 01:19:19.140
And they think it's the first time I've ever heard it.
And I'm like,
okay,

1377
01:19:19.141 --> 01:19:22.950
do you really want to do comedian club comics?
There's nothing we haven't.
Yeah.

1378
01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:26.310
<v 2>Yeah.
Especially if you work the store cause there's no crowd control.</v>

1379
01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:27.870
But do you know,
like I've,
I've had,

1380
01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:31.260
there's like so many videos online of me dealing with hackers and be like,

1381
01:19:31.261 --> 01:19:33.180
well how do you get so good at that fucking work?

1382
01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:36.750
<v 3>You can't even see them because what people don't understand the common shares</v>

1383
01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:40.200
the way Mitzi lidded is you,
you're blinded by the light and you,

1384
01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:43.080
they're completely anonymous.
You can't even go,
hey fucking v-neck.

1385
01:19:43.090 --> 01:19:45.190
Cause you don't know what anyone's wearing.
Cause you see a black man.

1386
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:49.590
<v 2>Well there's also this thing that's going on in Hollywood that's very different</v>

1387
01:19:49.591 --> 01:19:53.460
than anywhere else where there's a bunch of people that they're not fulfilled.

1388
01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:57.970
Like if you come to Pasadena and you do a set in Pasadena,
like those,

1389
01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:01.500
a lot of those people are not actors.
So not in Showbiz.
You'd work in Denver.

1390
01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:03.590
Those are not showbiz people.
You know what I mean?

1391
01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:06.780
You'll occasionally get the non showbiz tackler but a point.

1392
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:08.090
But that was fucking show.

1393
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:13.090
<v 1>Biz failures are the most bitter weird people you'll ever encounter.</v>

1394
01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.620
<v 0>Well,
here's the other thing is I think that every people,</v>

1395
01:20:15.621 --> 01:20:18.110
a lot of times that people that come to comedy clubs say they're,

1396
01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:22.010
they're the funniest friend in their group.
Oh yeah.
Do you know what I mean?

1397
01:20:22.011 --> 01:20:25.250
You always know when the guy's like,
oh,
you're the funny guy in the group.

1398
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:29.850
You're the funny lawyer.
Yeah,
you're the funny lawyer,
but you're the terror.

1399
01:20:29.851 --> 01:20:33.670
But you know,
but I don't,
I don't hecklers for some reason.
Don't,
um,

1400
01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:37.790
piss me off that much.
I don't know.
Maybe because I'm so sick of my own material.

1401
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:43.210
<v 1>An insult is like a respite from door.
I know.
I really am,</v>

1402
01:20:43.211 --> 01:20:44.560
but I don't totally,

1403
01:20:44.561 --> 01:20:48.840
my maybe it's cause I usually agree with them to something when they yell in

1404
01:20:48.841 --> 01:20:52.030
Salt.
I'm like,
that's a good point.
I don't know what it is.

1405
01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:55.500
They're good natured.
And you know,
sometimes you,

1406
01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:58.150
you counter people that are just trying to have fun and those people aren't

1407
01:20:58.151 --> 01:21:02.230
nearly as as Shitty as the ones you'll encounter that are just rude.

1408
01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:04.790
<v 0>I am so desperate and I'm interested in your thought on this.</v>

1409
01:21:04.791 --> 01:21:09.320
I am so desperate to figure out how to be present because I can't do it.

1410
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:14.300
It doesn't come natural to me to meditate present in the moment I do to Gilgo
no,

1411
01:21:14.301 --> 01:21:17.700
I can't do yoga.
I can't do it.
It's not for me.
Uh,

1412
01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:20.480
my inner monologue is too treacherous.
The whole idea.

1413
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:22.070
I think most of beat that down.

1414
01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:26.540
I'm now doing this meditation practice that's based on John Bowlby's theory of

1415
01:21:26.541 --> 01:21:27.374
attachment,

1416
01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:32.330
which is a show try to rewire your neural pathways in terms of how we attach to

1417
01:21:32.331 --> 01:21:34.610
people.
And when you grew up in a Catholic environment,

1418
01:21:34.611 --> 01:21:39.510
your Amygdala doesn't develop the pathways to I think is hippocampus.

1419
01:21:39.511 --> 01:21:43.240
And tell me if I'm wrong and bloviating um,
that,
uh,

1420
01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.950
calms your brain down because you're held such high alert as a kid.

1421
01:21:45.951 --> 01:21:49.610
I developed an adrenaline addiction so early on that it's so hard for me to calm

1422
01:21:49.611 --> 01:21:52.790
myself down,
which is something I want to mention about smoking.
A,

1423
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:57.080
a doctor told me that,
um,
that,
not that I was going to,

1424
01:21:57.081 --> 01:22:01.430
but was saying something about smoking is the inhaling of smoking because you,

1425
01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.830
when you inhale,
when you smoke,
you take 10 deep breaths.

1426
01:22:03.831 --> 01:22:06.650
Let's say if you take 10 deep breaths without a cigarette,

1427
01:22:06.710 --> 01:22:07.910
that's going to calm you down.

1428
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:10.640
So sometimes the placebo of smoking is just the inhaling,

1429
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:11.840
which I thought was interesting.

1430
01:22:12.490 --> 01:22:15.980
That makes a lot of people go outside and just take 10 deep breaths.

1431
01:22:15.981 --> 01:22:17.750
You're going to feel better with or without a cigarette.

1432
01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:21.810
<v 1>You know who Wim Hoff is?
Yeah.
The,
the ice guy climbed to the top of the,</v>

1433
01:22:21.811 --> 01:22:26.360
I do his breathing method before.
It's amazing.
Wow.
Have you gotten sick?

1434
01:22:26.361 --> 01:22:29.430
Doesn't he say you can control your immune system,
which by the way as you can,

1435
01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:32.050
I mean I haven't gotten sick but like I was feeling sick the other night but I

1436
01:22:32.051 --> 01:22:34.790
eat a giant chunk of garlic.
My kids are sick.

1437
01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:37.250
Like when you have kids they get sick all the time and everybody in the house

1438
01:22:37.251 --> 01:22:39.920
gets sick.
Like my wife has a little bit of a cold.
My Yacht,

1439
01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.540
my middle daughter has a pretty good call.

1440
01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:44.980
She's been home from school for a couple of days.
Oh No,
I just ate.

1441
01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:48.430
I was feeling little scratchy last night.
Sorry.
Just chunks of garlic,
frank,

1442
01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.420
all this Kombucha and went to sleep.
Yeah,
I'm fine.

1443
01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:52.310
But my immune system is on point.

1444
01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:55.640
I bet that mean I'd be interested in if it changed.

1445
01:22:57.340 --> 01:22:59.870
It's comedy clubs.
I am telling you though,
something to do with that.

1446
01:22:59.910 --> 01:23:04.370
Never get sick,
but it's also healthy food.
I eat really healthy.
I'm like,

1447
01:23:04.371 --> 01:23:06.160
come on marrow bone

1448
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:10.430
<v 0>marrow is my new thing.
Bone marrow game changer.
Do you eat elk?
I don't want,</v>

1449
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:13.480
I was waiting for this to come up.
I follow you on Instagram.

1450
01:23:13.481 --> 01:23:17.420
So I'm just worried like I'm not going to go home with so much fucking meat.

1451
01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:20.830
You Cook.
You know what I do.
But I pretty much bone broth,

1452
01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:25.120
bone marrow and eggs are the only meats I do.
Wow.
Yeah.
Bone marrow,

1453
01:23:25.121 --> 01:23:29.950
bone broth.
And so I'm about to go fucking wolf.
I am alone.

1454
01:23:31.230 --> 01:23:34.270
I am the lone wolf now.
I'm essentially,

1455
01:23:34.271 --> 01:23:38.560
my ex boyfriend used to call me Nell because now remember that Jodi foster movie

1456
01:23:38.561 --> 01:23:42.730
where she was raised by wolves cause I got no attention as a kid and all light

1457
01:23:44.710 --> 01:23:47.710
cause I have no social skills or people skills.
That's not true at all.

1458
01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:49.810
I'm working on it.
I'm getting,
I'm not socialized.

1459
01:23:49.811 --> 01:23:52.180
I also have an extra bone in my foot.
I'm not fully evolved.

1460
01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:55.530
Like I'm still a primate.
I swear to God you have an extra bone,

1461
01:23:55.550 --> 01:24:00.060
your forehead like where?
Like a webbing or like I'm basically um,

1462
01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.410
have you got your,
um,
what is it?
Your saliva test,

1463
01:24:02.411 --> 01:24:06.040
your DNA test thing that they're 23 and me,
you shouldn't vote.

1464
01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:10.630
They won't let you vote if you,
if you yeah,
if they see,
so I am in the,

1465
01:24:10.631 --> 01:24:15.070
I think 99 percentile of neanderthal deviation.
Really?
Yeah.

1466
01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.980
So you definitely have some neanderthal.
Oh yeah.
I'm an animal.

1467
01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:23.050
I'm a chocolate dark chocolate.
Died like an animal.

1468
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:27.530
Like I eat things like I'll just eat like I was out with um,

1469
01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.710
a friend of mine the other night and there was like a drink on the,

1470
01:24:29.711 --> 01:24:33.140
and I'll just drink other,
like I'll just drink trash.
Like I'm just like,
uh,

1471
01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:37.090
I'm like a barn yard culture.
Just the way you grew up.
Yeah,

1472
01:24:37.091 --> 01:24:40.270
like I just as like scarcity complex.
If you've never knew when food was coming,

1473
01:24:40.271 --> 01:24:43.090
you never knew when you were going to get attention again.
I wasn't socialized.

1474
01:24:43.091 --> 01:24:47.170
Like I learned,
I just learned how to make eye contact like two years ago.

1475
01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:52.690
I swear to God,
I'm not kidding.
The most basic shit.
I was like not,

1476
01:24:52.691 --> 01:24:55.330
I used to look like,
okay,
so I'm looking at you now.

1477
01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.480
I used to just look here for eye contact and someone like,

1478
01:24:58.481 --> 01:24:59.860
I'm looking at the like right side of your head.

1479
01:25:00.230 --> 01:25:02.560
And this guy worked with Rob Anderson.
Finally one day was like,

1480
01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.270
do you know that you're looking at like,

1481
01:25:04.330 --> 01:25:06.950
it's like he was like self conscious about like his hairline and I was like,

1482
01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.500
what?
What are you looking at?
I was like,

1483
01:25:08.501 --> 01:25:11.560
what do you mean I'm looking in your eyes?
He's like,
no you're not,

1484
01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:13.240
and I asked all my friends,
they're like,
oh yeah,

1485
01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:17.230
you always look to the right of our eyebrow.
Like I would just look over here.

1486
01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:19.750
I'm looking at your eyebrow right now.
What do you think?

1487
01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:23.950
I'm looking at your eyes.
I can't see.
I'm so bad at this.
I don't know.

1488
01:25:24.010 --> 01:25:28.610
I'm looking at your right eyebrow right now.
Can you tell kind of like,

1489
01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:30.190
here was my question.
I was like,

1490
01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:32.830
is the right I supposed to look in the right eye and the left eye is supposed to

1491
01:25:32.831 --> 01:25:36.610
look in the left die or do I look like to the center of your nose?

1492
01:25:36.630 --> 01:25:39.040
I think as long as you're looking at the eyes,
it's okay.

1493
01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:42.760
I think two eyes look at one eye.
That's kind of what I'm doing now.

1494
01:25:42.850 --> 01:25:44.770
You know when you're some guys,

1495
01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.620
this is always insecurity from an insecurity with me.

1496
01:25:47.621 --> 01:25:51.280
Some guys when they would fight,
they would look their opponent in the eye.

1497
01:25:51.281 --> 01:25:56.030
So aggressive,
so intimate.
I always looked like in the chin,

1498
01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:01.330
I look peripherally like abstract.
I see the whole body.

1499
01:26:01.331 --> 01:26:03.980
I would always look at people like I know that when I

1500
01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:08.900
<v 3>am on stage and if someone's not laughing or if I'm not connected,</v>

1501
01:26:08.901 --> 01:26:10.940
like I'll look them in the eye and then I,

1502
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:14.540
that's how you get them to be obsequious yeah,
that's how you get them.

1503
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:15.940
That's obsequious

1504
01:26:18.810 --> 01:26:19.700
you're attacking.

1505
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:23.060
But eye contact is like the most aggressive shit you can think about it.

1506
01:26:23.061 --> 01:26:23.630
If someone's,

1507
01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:25.940
you're in trader Joe's and someone looks you in the eye or like what you want to

1508
01:26:25.941 --> 01:26:28.640
fucking go.
I mean you say hi,

1509
01:26:30.190 --> 01:26:32.090
how's it possible that I'm more aggressive than your job?

1510
01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:35.840
People make eye contact with me cause you're famous and you know that's what

1511
01:26:35.841 --> 01:26:37.820
they're doing.
But if they weren't,
I would just say hi.

1512
01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:40.830
If you were in another country and someone just stared at you in the eyes,
Oh,

1513
01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.440
you looked at them and they didn't look away.

1514
01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.310
I would think that trying to steal my liver.
Yeah.

1515
01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:49.010
Well the chances are you probably are carrying a liver with the amount of meat

1516
01:26:49.011 --> 01:26:49.960
you would just have on you at all.

1517
01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:55.580
You have had liver read this book called source nutrition or something

1518
01:26:55.581 --> 01:26:56.414
nutrition.

1519
01:26:56.660 --> 01:27:00.590
It's about how the organs of the animal have more nutrients in the meat.

1520
01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:03.020
<v 2>Oh,
they definitely do.
Yeah.
Wolves always go right to the liver.</v>

1521
01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:05.000
That's how they established the alpha.

1522
01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:07.660
When they kill something or you've killed a Caribou,
the,

1523
01:27:07.661 --> 01:27:09.020
the Alpha Wolf will eat them.

1524
01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:13.810
<v 3>They were first there.
And it's all about how the human evolution of the brain,</v>

1525
01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:14.450
uh,

1526
01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:19.270
was largely expedited once we started eating bone marrow because humans couldn't

1527
01:27:19.271 --> 01:27:20.710
kill their own food in the beginning.

1528
01:27:20.711 --> 01:27:24.760
So they would rely on eating the leftovers of wolves in lions and shit.

1529
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.470
And what was leftover was always the bones and the shit that they didn't eat.

1530
01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:31.480
So they start eating the marrow and then their brains started growing

1531
01:27:31.481 --> 01:27:35.350
exponentially and then they were able to start developing tools and hunt their

1532
01:27:35.351 --> 01:27:38.590
own food.
Then he started eating meat again because they hunted their own food,

1533
01:27:38.591 --> 01:27:42.580
stopped eating the bones and what they thought was the leftover trash and then

1534
01:27:42.581 --> 01:27:44.770
sort of plateaued.
It's so fast,

1535
01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:46.160
<v 2>meaning when you think about human beings,</v>

1536
01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:50.210
because what I've read is that human beings had been in the shape as far as we

1537
01:27:50.211 --> 01:27:53.960
know for roughly 200 plus thousand years,

1538
01:27:54.170 --> 01:27:57.500
but we've only been talking for 70.
Wow.

1539
01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:03.100
So like our ability to communicate was only established about 70,000 years ago.

1540
01:28:04.341 --> 01:28:08.990
So for the first hundred 30 plus thousand years,
there was no talking,

1541
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:14.030
<v 3>which sometimes talking is just confuses people.</v>

1542
01:28:14.850 --> 01:28:18.030
I feel like we can communicate so much better non verbally then we can verbally.

1543
01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:21.780
That's not true at all.
I definitely,
I'm being,
um,
what's the word?

1544
01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:27.120
MALEC facetious.
Yes.
Yes.
Um,
I know that I talk too much I should talk about,

1545
01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:31.060
<v 2>but there's always these theories about like why the brain is the size that it</v>

1546
01:28:31.061 --> 01:28:32.890
is like the doubling of the human brain size.

1547
01:28:32.891 --> 01:28:37.150
Apparently it's like the biggest mystery in the entire fossil record of any

1548
01:28:37.151 --> 01:28:39.790
animal.
Like they don't know.
They don't know what it is.

1549
01:28:39.791 --> 01:28:44.350
There's all these theories about maybe it was the consumption of more protein,

1550
01:28:44.351 --> 01:28:47.110
but then the problem with that theory is,
well what about mountain lions?

1551
01:28:47.111 --> 01:28:49.610
How come they don't have giant fucking brains?
What about,
you know,

1552
01:28:49.690 --> 01:28:52.410
what about bears?
Why don't they have the biggest brains?
It there's,

1553
01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:56.440
then there's the other theories that we developed the throwing arm and that are

1554
01:28:56.441 --> 01:28:59.290
throwing arm,
the ability to throw at something and hit it.

1555
01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:02.570
It led us to these problem solving skills.
All these different,

1556
01:29:02.571 --> 01:29:06.510
cause we figured out,
oh I can develop a tool now I can develop a weapon.

1557
01:29:06.690 --> 01:29:08.070
But that doesn't make any sense either.

1558
01:29:08.190 --> 01:29:11.730
The most fascinating was Terence Mckenna's cause Terence Mckenna's is,

1559
01:29:11.731 --> 01:29:16.731
he has a theory called the stoned ape theory and his is based on silicide and he

1560
01:29:16.861 --> 01:29:17.694
believes that.

1561
01:29:17.770 --> 01:29:21.750
And the crazy thing about this theory is it coincides with climate change.

1562
01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:26.520
Cause 2 million years ago,
the,
uh,
rain forest,
the climate has shifted,

1563
01:29:26.521 --> 01:29:31.380
rainforest receded into grasslands and he thinks that these primates came down

1564
01:29:31.381 --> 01:29:34.680
from trees and started experimenting with different food sources.

1565
01:29:34.681 --> 01:29:38.580
And one of the things he's Angela animals cows and like they would shit and then

1566
01:29:38.581 --> 01:29:40.890
these silicide mushrooms would grow on cow patties.

1567
01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:44.250
Well they would flip over these 10 cow patties looking for bugs and worms

1568
01:29:44.251 --> 01:29:45.660
because they were always underneath there to eat.

1569
01:29:45.930 --> 01:29:49.200
But they also had these mushrooms that were growing on the cow patties on a lot

1570
01:29:49.201 --> 01:29:52.920
of them were siliciden mushrooms and that the silicide mushrooms,

1571
01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:57.690
which were incredibly common in this area.
When you eat them in low doses,

1572
01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:00.760
they increased visual acuity to make you horny.
Um,

1573
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:03.630
so that would make a better hunter and more likely to breed.

1574
01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:08.840
And then in high doses they have these transcendent psychedelic experiences and

1575
01:30:09.271 --> 01:30:13.200
they would allow them to think out of the box,
be more creative,

1576
01:30:13.410 --> 01:30:14.260
come up with your right.
Right.

1577
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:19.060
Then also silicide but has been known to regenerate neurons.
Like there's,

1578
01:30:19.061 --> 01:30:20.400
there's all these subjects are doing it right

1579
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:23.430
<v 0>now about the properties or psilocybin.
This pill.</v>

1580
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:26.600
What pill of some mushroom pill?
Sorry,
I keep pointing.
It goes,

1581
01:30:26.610 --> 01:30:31.370
I'm going to stop doing,
that's okay.
Point the,
is there a cordyceps shroom tech?

1582
01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:35.110
Yes.
This one.
This is Alpha brain.
This is,
this is not mushroom,

1583
01:30:36.210 --> 01:30:39.630
cordyceps mushroom,
but it's not the same one from tech.
Same Company.

1584
01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:42.510
Same thing that you're talking about right now.
No,
no,
no,
no.

1585
01:30:42.511 --> 01:30:46.170
Silicide been his magic mushrooms.
Psychedelic mushrooms.
Okay.
For Real.

1586
01:30:46.171 --> 01:30:50.190
You don't have any psychedelic experience?
Nothing can be done.
Mushrooms,

1587
01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:54.830
mushrooms.
I did LSD.
Uh,
I still have scars on my,
I'm not calling

1588
01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:02.430
myself barring the wall and one.
Um,
no.

1589
01:31:02.431 --> 01:31:04.950
I remember the one time I did like acid acid,

1590
01:31:04.951 --> 01:31:09.120
like the tabs of acid was in Rehobeth beach,
Maryland.
I'll be Dallas.
Um,

1591
01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:12.690
and uh,
we were playing,
do you know the card game asshole?
You know,

1592
01:31:12.691 --> 01:31:16.830
were you like we would do,
when you lost the card deck,
you would,

1593
01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:20.120
would cut someone's knuckles with the card deck until the white led.

1594
01:31:20.130 --> 01:31:21.750
I know hardcore white trash it.

1595
01:31:22.110 --> 01:31:26.390
And so I still have like little scars on my knuckles from that.
And then on acid.

1596
01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:29.130
Yeah.
And then I like lost my mind,
so I never did that again.

1597
01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:35.550
I go hard.
I am a ride or die and it's why I never did acid.

1598
01:31:35.610 --> 01:31:38.130
And then I spent the next like 18 hours being like,
this is never going to end.

1599
01:31:38.131 --> 01:31:41.220
This is never going to end.
This is all fall.
And then,
um,

1600
01:31:41.370 --> 01:31:43.350
I did mushrooms a couple times,
but it's not

1601
01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:44.453
<v 2>go thing.</v>

1602
01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:48.230
That's the thing about psychedelics is the bad trips come from the Il and

1603
01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:49.380
inability to let go.

1604
01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:52.320
I had a hard time with it when I first started doing psychedelics.
Well,

1605
01:31:52.890 --> 01:31:55.380
it's like you try to battle it and you can't battle it.

1606
01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:59.620
<v 0>You have to just succumb to it.
Got to give in.
I was 13.
I mean,
I had no</v>

1607
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.410
<v 3>ability.
I had.
Right.</v>

1608
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:06.190
<v 1>That's crazy.
You're 13.
She's like,
if I did it now,
I probably could,
uh,</v>

1609
01:32:06.710 --> 01:32:09.650
acquiesce a little bit,
most likely,
hopefully.
Have you,
uh,

1610
01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:11.180
ever done isolation tank?

1611
01:32:12.690 --> 01:32:17.490
<v 3>No,
I did.
You know,
I'm in Gary in Utah.
The Amon.
It's like,
uh,</v>

1612
01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:22.060
I did like a debt pervasion tank.
That's different.
Sensory deprivation tank.
Yeah,

1613
01:32:22.170 --> 01:32:25.860
same thing.
Different.
Um,
what is an almond Gary relevant Gary.
It's like a,

1614
01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:30.330
this like wellness place and they have a giant sensory deprivation tank where

1615
01:32:30.331 --> 01:32:32.820
it's like two inches of water.
And you float

1616
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:37.930
<v 1>in this black.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Paul should be a lot deeper than two inches.</v>

1617
01:32:38.290 --> 01:32:40.370
Two inches.
Or maybe it was more than that.
Well,

1618
01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:45.130
in order to free your body weight,
however,
however many is required.
12.
Okay.
12.

1619
01:32:45.131 --> 01:32:48.710
Okay.
Now you're just thinking,
oh fat.
No,
no.
I'm saying the person's body.
Yes.

1620
01:32:48.711 --> 01:32:52.690
You're two inches smaller than half of your body has to be underwater.

1621
01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:58.020
Whatever it is.
Float.
So obviously,
you know,
you're dealing with some maps.
Yes,

1622
01:32:58.021 --> 01:33:01.090
yes.
I have to have like 11 inches of water.

1623
01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.630
<v 3>Right.
I love how literal you are.
You know what you are.</v>

1624
01:33:03.690 --> 01:33:07.560
You're the guy in a fight who you can never win because you just stick to the

1625
01:33:07.561 --> 01:33:10.500
literal facts in any one.
Exaggerating is going to lose.

1626
01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.990
So I feel like you're the guy who was like,
I didn't say,

1627
01:33:13.410 --> 01:33:15.600
I didn't say you were a bitch.
I said you were being a bit,
yeah,

1628
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:18.930
<v 1>I would never do that.
No.
Like,
like on the form,</v>

1629
01:33:18.970 --> 01:33:22.280
like you're going to win on a technicality is way to have an argument.
Yeah.

1630
01:33:22.890 --> 01:33:24.300
<v 3>Find that smart guys.</v>

1631
01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:28.710
Like I was dating this guy who's a doctor and I could never,
I'd be like,
well,

1632
01:33:28.711 --> 01:33:31.140
I mean it's not like you were there.
He's like,
I was there at two 30 I'm like,

1633
01:33:31.141 --> 01:33:34.230
but you were late.
He's like,
I was an like stuck to the technicalities.

1634
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.511
<v 1>Well,</v>

1635
01:33:34.511 --> 01:33:37.640
I think truly smart people don't get involved in relationships with people that

1636
01:33:37.641 --> 01:33:41.090
argue over shit like that.
Interesting.
You got me.

1637
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:44.800
You got me.
But I'm a comedian,
so I'm,

1638
01:33:44.850 --> 01:33:48.410
I don't know if this is cut short chicken or egg.
I tend to exaggerate things.

1639
01:33:48.411 --> 01:33:51.350
I'm looking at this.
There's two inches of water I will find.
Yes.

1640
01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:56.380
And it screws up my relationships because I think you'll lose credibility.

1641
01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:59.330
Everything goes back to you fucking up these relationships with these

1642
01:33:59.331 --> 01:34:03.890
relationships,
not going well comedian,
I just,
it's fucked me.

1643
01:34:03.891 --> 01:34:04.760
Or maybe it's a crutch.

1644
01:34:04.761 --> 01:34:08.030
I lean on to a so that I don't have to just take responsibility for my bank.

1645
01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:10.910
It's going to fuck you until you find the right guy and then it'd be great.
Yeah.

1646
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.760
It's not that,
it's just,
it's,
it's,
it's all,
I mean,
I,

1647
01:34:13.761 --> 01:34:16.050
it's the same thing with everybody.
It's like whatever,

1648
01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:19.130
it's like some people have personalities that are more compatible with more

1649
01:34:19.131 --> 01:34:22.700
people,
but your personality,
I'm sure it's compatible with somebody.

1650
01:34:22.701 --> 01:34:27.040
You just gotta find that person who can,
who's,
you know,
the right key.

1651
01:34:27.050 --> 01:34:29.110
Do your lock or vice a versa.

1652
01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:34.160
Impressed by you because you have your career and your personal life are equally

1653
01:34:34.161 --> 01:34:38.900
successful.
This is fortunate,
very lucky,
very lucky.

1654
01:34:39.170 --> 01:34:43.320
But also I'd like think about it,
a lot of work on in a lot and you do things,

1655
01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:43.760
you know,

1656
01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.740
I think if you are not like comfortable in either or like I read something today

1657
01:34:48.741 --> 01:34:53.470
that made me sad,
I cried,
I crowds,
I'm such a bitch.
I love it.
No,

1658
01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:56.930
don't do that.
It's strength.
Check the road.
Um,

1659
01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:01.040
it was about Scott Wieland from stone temple pilots and it was a story that his

1660
01:35:01.041 --> 01:35:05.120
wife rolling stone one glorify God birthed by tragedy.

1661
01:35:05.690 --> 01:35:08.690
So sad addiction is now.
It was not just the addiction,

1662
01:35:08.691 --> 01:35:13.580
it was the way he treats his kids,
the way he sort of replaced his children.

1663
01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:17.990
He had a son and a daughter with the first wife and then once he got the new

1664
01:35:17.991 --> 01:35:19.550
wife and he had a new family,

1665
01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:23.210
he replaced his family and he just stopped paying attention to his son,

1666
01:35:23.211 --> 01:35:24.470
stopped paying attention to his daughter.

1667
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:28.310
They never went to his new house and all that was just such a bummer.

1668
01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:32.610
<v 3>Addiction.
No is like,
it is nasty.
I,
by the way,</v>

1669
01:35:32.611 --> 01:35:34.770
the kids that didn't live with him,
we're probably better off.

1670
01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:37.880
<v 1>Maybe you might be right.
You might be right.</v>

1671
01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:42.870
Maybe being raised in addiction and heroin.
God dammit.
Yeah.
I look at Erwin is,

1672
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:48.530
Jerry can never,
you'll never win.
You'll never,
you're right,
you're right.

1673
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:51.180
But I work at it.
I think you have to work at it.

1674
01:35:51.181 --> 01:35:53.930
And if you don't work like especially like taking care of kids,

1675
01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:56.180
like it's just so fucking important.

1676
01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:59.460
I know because you were neglected because I was neglected.
I think we don't,

1677
01:35:59.510 --> 01:36:04.510
we have that thing in our head and I am fucking bound and determined to like let

1678
01:36:04.851 --> 01:36:06.080
my kids know that I love them,

1679
01:36:06.081 --> 01:36:08.350
I care about him and I spent a lot of time with them.
Yeah.

1680
01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:09.790
And I'll talk about it too much

1681
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:12.970
<v 3>time.
It's,
I'm not on my phone cause I had,</v>

1682
01:36:13.150 --> 01:36:15.840
I wasn't like alone in a base ignored.

1683
01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:20.500
I had people next to me who were not who they were with me,

1684
01:36:20.501 --> 01:36:21.910
but they weren't hearing me or seeing me.

1685
01:36:21.911 --> 01:36:24.050
I was invisible even though people were around me interacting,

1686
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:28.240
which is sometimes more confusing to a child then just complete absence.
Yeah.

1687
01:36:28.290 --> 01:36:29.230
Cause then I'm going,

1688
01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:32.290
I'm being rejected on a minute by minute basis by someone who's choosing

1689
01:36:32.291 --> 01:36:33.670
something else over me.
So when you,

1690
01:36:33.850 --> 01:36:36.850
the most tragic thing is when you see the new alcoholism I think is,

1691
01:36:36.851 --> 01:36:40.630
is kids with their parents,
their parents are on their phone right next to them,

1692
01:36:40.631 --> 01:36:44.290
completely checked out.
But right next to them.
So you're there,
but you're not.

1693
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:48.160
<v 1>Yeah,
that's a,
that's a really common thing.
But here's what's fucked up.</v>

1694
01:36:48.430 --> 01:36:51.460
And this is something that I struggle with and a lot of my friends who have kids

1695
01:36:51.461 --> 01:36:52.300
struggle with as well.

1696
01:36:53.530 --> 01:36:57.320
A lot of people become interesting because of adversity they faced when they

1697
01:36:57.321 --> 01:36:58.154
were children.

1698
01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:00.880
And then you have children in the last thing you want is your children to

1699
01:37:00.881 --> 01:37:04.240
experience adversity.
Yeah.
And,
but the people that you like,
all come,

1700
01:37:04.241 --> 01:37:07.990
ever all my friends came from fucked up households.
Every single one of them.

1701
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:12.140
<v 3>Well,
the good news is with bullying and your kids will find it.</v>

1702
01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:14.570
I'm sure there'll be plenty of adverse,
I hate to break it to you,

1703
01:37:14.571 --> 01:37:17.740
but there'll be a lot of adversity.
I would imagine that you can't,
you know,
well,

1704
01:37:17.770 --> 01:37:20.250
there's always going to be inside of your sanctuary of your home.
Right.

1705
01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:23.260
<v 1>But,
um,
what I'm saying is the all came from fucked up houses.</v>

1706
01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:26.530
<v 3>This is all,
but there's also no,
you tell me.</v>

1707
01:37:26.531 --> 01:37:30.010
I feel like the last generation was just kind of a wash.
Like,

1708
01:37:30.011 --> 01:37:33.040
I don't know that many people who had like great childhoods just because like

1709
01:37:33.041 --> 01:37:34.120
that generation of men,

1710
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:38.830
alcoholism was so rampant in the fifties I mean people don't think about the

1711
01:37:38.831 --> 01:37:43.060
fact that like in the 20s this country had to outlaw drinking.

1712
01:37:43.061 --> 01:37:46.560
That's how bad it was for 10 years.
Why it happened though in the 20s

1713
01:37:46.730 --> 01:37:47.930
<v 1>it's not why it happened.
Why did it happen?</v>

1714
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:52.520
It happened because they outlawed marijuana.
Right,
right.
But this is,

1715
01:37:52.521 --> 01:37:56.280
this is what happened.
Okay.
They,
what what they did was they

1716
01:37:56.310 --> 01:38:00.690
<v 2>tried to control the population and one of the ways they were going to control</v>

1717
01:38:00.691 --> 01:38:03.060
the population was outlawing drinking,
right?

1718
01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:06.870
They tried to put a shackle on people cause they didn't want people going out in

1719
01:38:06.871 --> 01:38:07.800
the streets and doing these things.

1720
01:38:07.801 --> 01:38:11.760
But what they did is they empowered organized crime.
And in doing that,

1721
01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:15.300
what they did was they just made al Capone ranch and they made all these people

1722
01:38:15.301 --> 01:38:17.520
rich.
And then once they did that,

1723
01:38:17.521 --> 01:38:21.450
then they tried to put a stop to other drugs so they can take these people that

1724
01:38:21.451 --> 01:38:25.320
they use to enforce the alcohol laws and they enforced other laws.

1725
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:28.050
Like that's when marijuana became elite.
Right,
right.
But all of it,

1726
01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:31.500
it's just a control issue.
It's not that it was necessary.
Right.
In fact,

1727
01:38:31.501 --> 01:38:35.400
the best way to keep people from drinking is to let people drink around them.

1728
01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:38.850
See the disastrous effects.
Like this is why you don't like,

1729
01:38:38.851 --> 01:38:40.710
you're in all these groups,
why you went all these groups,

1730
01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:43.400
you in all these groups cause you grew up with people that were fucked up.
Yeah.

1731
01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:44.730
You know,
I never touched coke.

1732
01:38:44.731 --> 01:38:47.430
And one of the reasons why I never touched coke because I grew up with coke

1733
01:38:47.431 --> 01:38:49.930
heads,
right.
I had coke heads that were friends of mine.

1734
01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:54.270
One of my good friend's cousin was a coke head and I saw it from a bunch of

1735
01:38:54.271 --> 01:38:57.180
people.
And then I had a buddy who died from heroin.
Yeah.
I've never,

1736
01:38:57.210 --> 01:38:58.590
I've never even thought about dying.
Yep.

1737
01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:02.560
<v 0>So when you tell people they can't do something,
they want to do it more.</v>

1738
01:39:02.561 --> 01:39:03.520
So like in Europe,

1739
01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:06.910
I mean there's a lot of alcoholism but it's not like as bad as it is here

1740
01:39:06.911 --> 01:39:08.140
because it's like yeah,
go for it.

1741
01:39:08.170 --> 01:39:10.720
They drink at 14 and they've got it out of their system and they have nothing to

1742
01:39:10.721 --> 01:39:14.570
prove and there's not,
yeah,
exactly.
They let kids try driving around it.

1743
01:39:15.310 --> 01:39:18.220
<v 2>I think it was more of a control issue than it was anything.</v>

1744
01:39:18.221 --> 01:39:21.250
And it all coincided with World War One and I think,
you know,

1745
01:39:21.251 --> 01:39:24.580
there was a bunch of people that wanted everyone to get back to work and make

1746
01:39:24.581 --> 01:39:25.420
America strong.

1747
01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:29.290
<v 0>But you need to just create slaves.</v>

1748
01:39:29.291 --> 01:39:32.560
You can't tell people what they can and can't do with their body.
You just can't.

1749
01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:37.030
You can't.
And then initially because drinking is fun,
I like it for fun.

1750
01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:41.620
And,
and then in the fifties the fucking mad men generation,

1751
01:39:41.621 --> 01:39:42.700
the three Martini lunch,

1752
01:39:42.701 --> 01:39:45.490
like people were just drinking during the day at the office.

1753
01:39:45.491 --> 01:39:46.480
It was socially acceptable.

1754
01:39:46.481 --> 01:39:49.930
So that was our parents and our parent's parents were the first generation.

1755
01:39:49.931 --> 01:39:50.620
I mean,

1756
01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:54.850
trying to be good parents that even have the information to be able to be good

1757
01:39:54.851 --> 01:39:58.060
parents and we have the information on the psychology and the sociology and

1758
01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:01.690
alcoholism.
Like you're the first parent that's going like,
you know what,

1759
01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:05.470
I'm going to see my kid and let my kid cry and let my,

1760
01:40:05.530 --> 01:40:10.420
if I have a boy I'm gonna let him say like I don't feel good and not be like man

1761
01:40:10.421 --> 01:40:12.070
up and catch this ball.
You know,

1762
01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:14.690
it's the first generation that I feel like we're really um,

1763
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:17.350
know enough to be able to be good parents.

1764
01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:20.830
What'd you gotta know when to tell them the man up too though?
Yes,
of course.

1765
01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:24.430
The one to walk it off,
you know,
like,
like my five year old,

1766
01:40:24.431 --> 01:40:27.430
she'll cry where everything cause she knows the crying gets her attention.
Yeah.

1767
01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:30.670
And then I'll go,
look sweetie,
if you want a hug,
I'm happy to give you a hug.

1768
01:40:30.671 --> 01:40:33.190
But I know that that didn't hurt.
I saw what happened.
Yes.

1769
01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:37.800
There's really nothing she can enable.
Victimizing yourself willy.

1770
01:40:37.810 --> 01:40:42.110
Willy hurt cause she's five so she still has a lot of extra W's.
Yeah.

1771
01:40:42.170 --> 01:40:45.760
They put wheelie topped up my foot.

1772
01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:49.650
This like all these woo woo woo noise cause there's still have like honeybees,

1773
01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:52.810
your daddy's Joe Rogan.
You did a man the fuck up right now.
Suck it up.

1774
01:40:52.811 --> 01:40:56.590
You're embarrassing me.
Be Fine if we didn't love.
But you also let them know.

1775
01:40:56.610 --> 01:40:59.800
Yeah.
But I don't ignore,
I don't go,
hey stop fucking crying.
Yeah.

1776
01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:04.210
If your foot's fine and don't say that.
I go look,
you got to let it go.

1777
01:41:04.211 --> 01:41:07.540
It's just a sensation.
Yeah.
You know I read this thing,

1778
01:41:07.541 --> 01:41:10.670
there's this book called the fantasy bond.
Um,
about uh,

1779
01:41:10.810 --> 01:41:12.220
what happens when kids are ignored,

1780
01:41:12.221 --> 01:41:15.990
neglect and all that kind of stuff at kids would rather be physically abused and

1781
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.610
then ignored.
Yeah.
I've read that because at least they're getting their,

1782
01:41:19.630 --> 01:41:22.300
their existence is being validated and they don't,

1783
01:41:22.630 --> 01:41:26.980
they don't feel like their life is at stake.
I dated this girl and we broke up.

1784
01:41:27.850 --> 01:41:31.060
She dated some guy that hit her and I've told this story before,

1785
01:41:31.061 --> 01:41:34.720
but it was very bizarre.
It was a long time ago.
It was a long time.
Okay.

1786
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:39.500
Hit me up.
I was like 17 at the time.
Um,

1787
01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:43.180
but she was telling me that this guy hit her and I was like,
fuck.
And she's like,

1788
01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:47.740
you know what's fucked up is I like it.
And I was like,
whoa.
Context easy.

1789
01:41:47.741 --> 01:41:49.960
You don't want him to like hit you because you,

1790
01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:54.550
you know the thing in the dishwasher,
you want the light slap in bed.

1791
01:41:54.610 --> 01:41:57.790
I don't think it was a light slap.
I think there was like some beating up.

1792
01:41:58.570 --> 01:42:02.140
It was weird.
But also,
did he,
was he trained in Jujitsu?
Like you,

1793
01:42:02.141 --> 01:42:03.640
I don't think she'd want you to hit her.

1794
01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:07.360
Some random guy who's not trained fighter.
Yeah.

1795
01:42:09.050 --> 01:42:12.030
Shit.
He text me.
Hey,
I'm fine with Tony Hinchcliffe hitting me.

1796
01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:15.130
I don't want Joe Rogan.
Tony's like

1797
01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:22.010
Vegan.
Tony Hinchcliffe got off the Vegan.
No,

1798
01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:27.560
we're back influenced him.
Okay.
There you go to the gym a few times.
Okay.

1799
01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:31.150
So look,
you're not going to get this weight and beans.
Okay.
Maybe not him,

1800
01:42:31.330 --> 01:42:34.810
but yeah,
I think it's like,
depends on who's doing the hitting.

1801
01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:35.860
I wasn't even there when he hit me.

1802
01:42:35.890 --> 01:42:38.760
He did it last week for the first time I went to Fogo the child,

1803
01:42:38.770 --> 01:42:41.420
you know that places the Brazilian steakhouse.
I know what you're talking about.

1804
01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:48.400
Fucking meat.
Do you know my arch fair story about when he hazed me,

1805
01:42:48.690 --> 01:42:49.990
please use me at the comedy store.

1806
01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:53.040
He's June the beginning when I started the Commissar Hill.
I think he,

1807
01:42:53.050 --> 01:42:56.410
we told the story on his podcast but yeah,
he mentioned it.

1808
01:42:56.650 --> 01:42:59.660
Which is that like in the beginning when I got,
hey,
it's so hard,

1809
01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:04.060
you are not there to protect me because you had made your mass exodus from the

1810
01:43:04.061 --> 01:43:04.894
comic store.

1811
01:43:04.990 --> 01:43:08.170
It was like him and like David Taylor and all these guys used to just fucking

1812
01:43:09.150 --> 01:43:09.910
kill me.

1813
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:13.690
I mean they would just make my life miserable because I was like showed up in my

1814
01:43:13.691 --> 01:43:17.620
backpack and like,
you know,
Hoodie and I was like,
had,
she was like,

1815
01:43:17.621 --> 01:43:19.540
I'm going to make it as a comedian.
And they were like,

1816
01:43:19.541 --> 01:43:23.410
we're going to crush your soul.
And One Night Ari,

1817
01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:27.190
stall my backpack and hit it because I would always come with a backpack.

1818
01:43:27.190 --> 01:43:31.090
But he didn't know that my credit card had just gotten stolen and I just got a

1819
01:43:31.091 --> 01:43:33.820
call from the bank saying,
Hey,
some guy stole your credit card.
So he was like,

1820
01:43:33.821 --> 01:43:37.150
it's probably someone around you who stole your credit card,
copied it,
et cetera.

1821
01:43:37.450 --> 01:43:41.980
And then Ari stole my book bag,
put it like up in the back bar,

1822
01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:45.070
like hit it.
And then I instantly,
I couldn't find it,

1823
01:43:45.071 --> 01:43:50.071
started hysterically crying and made Tommy turn on the house lights in the or,

1824
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:54.530
which have you ever even seen lights on in the ocean?
It's very weird.

1825
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:59.510
She goes in there looking at a one night stand in the face.
Yeah,
totally.
And uh,

1826
01:43:59.810 --> 01:44:03.860
and yeah,
and he didn't admit that it was him for like a years until,

1827
01:44:03.861 --> 01:44:08.570
I think like seven years later was he was so like embarrassed or upset or

1828
01:44:08.571 --> 01:44:10.250
whatever.
That's probably not the word.

1829
01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:12.950
I don't think he is out of these capable of that.

1830
01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.930
Those are those kind of emotions.

1831
01:44:14.931 --> 01:44:19.490
But he then admitted to me finally that was made that stole your backpack.

1832
01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:24.080
Wow.
Yeah.
That didn't seem,
that wasn't as good as story telling him.

1833
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:30.590
Do you think there is a concerted effort to fuck with women when they start

1834
01:44:30.591 --> 01:44:34.880
doing standup comedy?
Fuck with them emotionally,
obviously.
Mentally.
Yeah.

1835
01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:39.620
And I'm grateful for it.
I'm glad they did.
I'm grateful they made me tougher.

1836
01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:42.470
You say though,
not a lot of women would say that.
Right?
Look,

1837
01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:47.040
I know maybe I'm not being feminist or Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
But I heard again,
I know,

1838
01:44:47.041 --> 01:44:51.740
I know.
That's why I'm,
that's why I said it with a tinge on it because I,
I again,

1839
01:44:51.741 --> 01:44:53.390
because I grew up playing sports,

1840
01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:58.010
I welcome adversity cause I know it makes me stronger so I don't complain about

1841
01:44:58.011 --> 01:45:01.590
it.
I know like pain,
muscle soreness,
all that stuff.

1842
01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:05.390
Like if I'm not sore after a workout the next day I'm bummed because I know that

1843
01:45:05.391 --> 01:45:06.290
I didn't work that hard.

1844
01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:11.510
So adversity at the comedy store and stuff I like knew instinctively you guys

1845
01:45:11.511 --> 01:45:13.370
are helping me.
You don't know you're helping me.

1846
01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:14.960
You're cause you're trying to hurt me,

1847
01:45:14.961 --> 01:45:18.470
but you're actually making me stronger and I'm grateful.

1848
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:23.450
That's a very unusual attitude though,
right?
Even for men or a woman.
Yeah,

1849
01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:27.500
for anybody.
And when you grow.
I grew up in an environment that was very like,

1850
01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:28.371
you know,

1851
01:45:28.371 --> 01:45:31.460
idle hands is the devil's work and if it doesn't hurt you're not doing it right.

1852
01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:36.090
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I'm grateful that I have that mentality because it,

1853
01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:40.220
it helps in doing standup.
So you stop for three months,

1854
01:45:40.221 --> 01:45:45.221
you've stopped for three months time it these decide three months sort of like,

1855
01:45:45.831 --> 01:45:50.500
I think stand up for me is very much like a haunting,
you know,
you get an Itch,

1856
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:53.810
you sort of like have stuff you have to talk about and instead of like boring

1857
01:45:53.811 --> 01:45:56.480
your friends at dinner with it or you have a podcast,
you have other outlets.

1858
01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:58.910
I wait till I'm like,
this is a gross word,

1859
01:45:58.911 --> 01:46:03.440
but like constipated with like an obsession of injustice.

1860
01:46:03.441 --> 01:46:06.050
Like right now there's nothing that's like keeping me up at night.

1861
01:46:06.051 --> 01:46:09.330
That's me that I have to get on stage and yell about.
And I,
if,

1862
01:46:09.370 --> 01:46:12.740
if I'm not obsessed with it,
why would I waste an audience member's time?

1863
01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:17.510
So when did you do your special?
Is first week of September.
Okay.

1864
01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:22.370
So when do you think you'll start getting that itch?
You're like a month.

1865
01:46:22.371 --> 01:46:25.970
I need to go on a couple of bad dates and like get pissed on or something,

1866
01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:29.810
you know,
cause they just did,

1867
01:46:29.811 --> 01:46:34.811
I did 50 cities in a year or something and like said so much.

1868
01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:40.300
And now I need to like get that 50 cities and I think I did figure out is this

1869
01:46:40.750 --> 01:46:44.750
like every week or is it like dude,
several different cities a week?
Uh,
yeah,

1870
01:46:44.751 --> 01:46:47.980
I was doing like Friday,
Saturday,
like one city Friday,
one city's Saturday,

1871
01:46:47.981 --> 01:46:49.980
sometimes one Sunday.
Where'd you film

1872
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:54.270
<v 3>for?
Like Santa Monica?
No,
I knew upset.
This is such a dorky comedian thing.</v>

1873
01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:57.300
My new obsession is to do and my did.
My last one in Irvine,

1874
01:46:57.301 --> 01:47:00.480
my new obsession is to go all around the country to tour.

1875
01:47:00.481 --> 01:47:04.470
And then when you shoot your special sleep in your own bed,
get your crew,

1876
01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:07.170
get your everybody and,
and shoot it here.

1877
01:47:07.171 --> 01:47:10.520
So I shut my last one in Irvine and then this one in Santa Monica and Santa

1878
01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:15.270
Monica,
the brode theater on Santa Monica College.
It's a beautiful theater.

1879
01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:19.320
I wanted it to feel like a club.
500 seats.
Gorgeous.
Looks like a spaceship,

1880
01:47:19.530 --> 01:47:22.080
you know,
cause when you shoot and you know I loved your,

1881
01:47:22.370 --> 01:47:24.480
the one you did in Denver,
but when you,
and I would love to,

1882
01:47:24.481 --> 01:47:27.890
I've been obsessed with shooting special at comedy works in Denver.
The um,

1883
01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:32.740
the other way you did the downtown one.
I love the other,
uh,
Tim looks like it.

1884
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.400
It's gorgeous.
Letterman square one.
And I was like,
should I do that?

1885
01:47:35.401 --> 01:47:36.234
But then you're in,

1886
01:47:36.250 --> 01:47:39.330
you're in a hotel and you're not and then the night out and then you're tired

1887
01:47:39.331 --> 01:47:40.380
and you don't have your restaurant,

1888
01:47:40.381 --> 01:47:42.930
you've got to get up and you're in a hotel room and you're like,
where's food?

1889
01:47:42.931 --> 01:47:44.490
And it just throws off your rhythm.

1890
01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:49.680
So my indulgence is to shoot a special in sleep in my bed the night before and

1891
01:47:49.681 --> 01:47:54.210
then after.
That's fucking smart,
you know,
cause no one be comfortable.
See you,

1892
01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:55.500
your last batch of the Denver one,

1893
01:47:55.501 --> 01:47:58.540
you talked about Denver and weed and that got into legalization,

1894
01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:01.380
we and all that kind of stuff.
But it's like,
for me it's like,

1895
01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:05.250
I don't think most people give a shit where you shoot it unless you make it a

1896
01:48:05.251 --> 01:48:06.390
cornerstone of what you're doing.

1897
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:10.020
So it's like I'm going to go all the way to Chicago to shoot it for no one cares

1898
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:12.270
that I've schlepped all the way to Chicago.
You know?

1899
01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:17.580
Isn't that my ego?
It's in your mind.
I think.
Yeah,
maybe.

1900
01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:18.840
I feel like for me,

1901
01:48:18.841 --> 01:48:22.010
and maybe it's just cause I'm a girl and I need my shit and my makeup artists,

1902
01:48:22.130 --> 01:48:26.070
I'm like fucking hair extensions and if I don't,
if I don't sleep eight hours,

1903
01:48:26.071 --> 01:48:29.910
I look like Steve Buscemi like I can't fuck around.
So being on the road is just,

1904
01:48:29.911 --> 01:48:31.530
I think that's where the being the girl comes in.

1905
01:48:31.531 --> 01:48:34.320
It just gets a little more complicated because when people are like,

1906
01:48:34.321 --> 01:48:35.610
is it harder?
Being a female comedian,

1907
01:48:35.611 --> 01:48:40.530
I'm like literally the differences I need my shit.
My like makeup,

1908
01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:42.720
I have to like schlepped my have to check luggage.

1909
01:48:42.721 --> 01:48:44.400
When I travel a furrowed one night,

1910
01:48:44.610 --> 01:48:48.810
I'm bound and determined to do all my specials from now on in smaller places.

1911
01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:51.450
Why would it bigger places all ego,
no one cares.

1912
01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:53.610
Like when you're watching at home,

1913
01:48:53.611 --> 01:48:55.800
you're sitting in your living room and you're sitting on a couch.

1914
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:57.150
It loses all the magic,

1915
01:48:57.151 --> 01:49:02.151
all the scope it no one cares and no one's doing oh look so and so sold 2000

1916
01:49:02.911 --> 01:49:06.240
tickets and Kevin Hart,
I like no one cares,
nobody cares.

1917
01:49:06.241 --> 01:49:10.110
And I don't even do audience reaction shots anymore.
It's for ego.

1918
01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:12.660
And then it also dates the special because number one,

1919
01:49:12.661 --> 01:49:15.780
if you can see the audience,
it's too brightly lit.
Number two,

1920
01:49:15.810 --> 01:49:17.640
you cut to it and then you see the like,

1921
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:21.810
you know Ross Perot t shirt so you'd know exactly what like,

1922
01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:23.730
it's like

1923
01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:29.280
nothing throws me off more than seeing a no fear tee shirt.
And I'm like,
oh,

1924
01:49:29.281 --> 01:49:33.600
that was shot in 1998 it takes away the timeless classic thing.

1925
01:49:34.110 --> 01:49:37.320
There's definitely some assholes in shorts and you're like,
Oh God,

1926
01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:40.020
I just think that that's a cheap way to cut away.

1927
01:49:40.590 --> 01:49:44.130
Cut away the director and he,
this was fucking insisting on that.

1928
01:49:44.131 --> 01:49:48.100
He wanted to keep the room that we had a fight about,
like even turned the lights

1929
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:51.460
<v 0>up during the first showing.
I was like,
why the fuck are the lights on?</v>

1930
01:49:51.461 --> 01:49:52.610
We had like a problem with it.

1931
01:49:52.611 --> 01:49:56.260
Standup specials are so fascinating to me because it's like we get so good at

1932
01:49:56.261 --> 01:49:57.700
something that's incredibly hard.

1933
01:49:57.701 --> 01:50:00.490
That's very much thought of is one of the hardest things you can do.
I mean,

1934
01:50:00.491 --> 01:50:03.910
how many people can get up on a stage and make a crowd laugh for an hour?

1935
01:50:03.911 --> 01:50:07.870
How many,
how many of you think housing and the housing in the world?

1936
01:50:09.190 --> 01:50:13.430
Maybe really good ones for an hour to kill it for an hour and might be a

1937
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:17.320
thousand in the country.
Maybe.
Maybe.
I mean there's more,

1938
01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:22.060
there's more heart surgeons where I think if you really had to be honest,

1939
01:50:22.150 --> 01:50:25.960
how many do you think are great?
How many do you think are really funny?

1940
01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:31.060
When I have set the hundred,
I would say 500
300 million people,

1941
01:50:31.150 --> 01:50:35.950
plus in this country,
three 50 with Mexicans.
I think that's,

1942
01:50:35.951 --> 01:50:38.800
uh,
that's probably write 500 people.
And I mean,

1943
01:50:38.801 --> 01:50:41.340
how many hearts surgeons are there?
How many neurosurgeons are there?
Oh,

1944
01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:46.320
thank God.
There's bond tons.
So it's like this is such a weird specialized thing.

1945
01:50:46.570 --> 01:50:49.810
And then we get so good at something that's so few people can get good at.

1946
01:50:49.811 --> 01:50:53.590
That's so hard.
I hope this doesn't come off like ego maniacal.
But um,

1947
01:50:53.710 --> 01:50:56.200
and then all of a sudden you're shooting your special,
the taping.

1948
01:50:56.201 --> 01:50:59.320
And then we changed the circumstances entirely.
We'd make it light.

1949
01:50:59.321 --> 01:51:02.530
We do it at 6:00 PM instead of an eight.
We totally changed the circuit.

1950
01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:06.550
We changed the rules of the game the one night that it really matters the most.

1951
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:12.100
Boom.
Cameras flying around.
There's stay behind me now.

1952
01:51:12.110 --> 01:51:16.350
I wear high heels and wear your hair down and you've never worn your hair down

1953
01:51:16.351 --> 01:51:17.530
and stand up before.

1954
01:51:17.530 --> 01:51:20.230
But the night that accounts are gonna wear your hair down and have makeup on.

1955
01:51:20.231 --> 01:51:20.980
It's just like,

1956
01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:25.980
so I tried to make the night that I shoot the special as replicate at night at a

1957
01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:29.110
normal night of the club as much as possible.
Same lighting,

1958
01:51:29.230 --> 01:51:33.150
same number of people.
I was only like 400 people,
you know,

1959
01:51:33.190 --> 01:51:35.050
no cameras in my face.
This,

1960
01:51:35.051 --> 01:51:38.650
my hair is down in this and it was a very big drama that my hair was down

1961
01:51:38.651 --> 01:51:40.720
because HBO wanted my hair to be down.
I was like,

1962
01:51:40.721 --> 01:51:42.780
I've never wore my hair down and doing stand up.

1963
01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:45.670
People want your hair to be done.
Well,
this is actually kind of a funny story.

1964
01:51:45.671 --> 01:51:49.790
Apparently Chris Rock suggested to them that I put my hair down.
Fuck Chris.

1965
01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:54.820
Jaime.
Yeah.
What does he know that calm and know about your hair?
He,
he did it.

1966
01:51:54.821 --> 01:51:57.850
I can battery called good hair.
What does he,

1967
01:51:57.860 --> 01:52:00.280
that's like me telling you not to wear makeup.
It's very,

1968
01:52:00.490 --> 01:52:03.940
it don't wear lipstick bitch.
I don't wear lipstick.
I

1969
01:52:06.110 --> 01:52:06.430
look,

1970
01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:11.430
I'm a fan of his and he's smart and he told Hbo that and then they were like,

1971
01:52:11.861 --> 01:52:16.600
we want you to wear your hair down.
And I was like,
no,
no,
no.
Fuck.

1972
01:52:16.601 --> 01:52:20.920
I know.
I got to know Chris rock get the fuck Outta here.

1973
01:52:21.330 --> 01:52:23.050
And I was like,
look,
I had some,

1974
01:52:23.051 --> 01:52:27.700
I do believe in kind of things that not always my ideas are the best ideas and

1975
01:52:27.701 --> 01:52:29.080
maybe other people know more than I do,

1976
01:52:29.081 --> 01:52:33.490
especially people who are doing comedy for 30 years.
So I just decided to do it.

1977
01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:37.000
And do you feel weird?
I felt very weird.

1978
01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:41.260
I felt like I was being attacked by like a wild animal the entire time.

1979
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:42.880
You see me like my hair,

1980
01:52:42.881 --> 01:52:47.170
like forgetting and I'm like super tweaked out in the special because my hair is

1981
01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:48.860
attacking me the whole time.
But yeah,
it's like,

1982
01:52:49.110 --> 01:52:52.130
it's like playing a sport with your hair down.
That's what it felt like to me.

1983
01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:54.380
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's,

1984
01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:57.890
and you've got muscle memory and you've got all of the sudden I'm fighting it,

1985
01:52:57.891 --> 01:53:00.950
but anything that throws a curve ball at me while I'm performing,

1986
01:53:00.951 --> 01:53:02.880
I welcome because it keeps me present.
Well,

1987
01:53:02.881 --> 01:53:05.420
especially something that throws a curve ball at you while you're doing a

1988
01:53:05.421 --> 01:53:07.010
special,
it's not just performing,

1989
01:53:07.011 --> 01:53:10.920
you're performing something that's going to be like a walk down forever.
Yeah.

1990
01:53:11.150 --> 01:53:11.391
Yeah.

1991
01:53:11.391 --> 01:53:15.800
But that's what I think we are best at having shit thrown in us and US having to

1992
01:53:15.801 --> 01:53:17.930
deal with it.
Sure,
sure.

1993
01:53:18.190 --> 01:53:21.770
But like sometimes it's not representative of the actual material itself and its

1994
01:53:21.771 --> 01:53:24.260
best form.
Never.
Never.
Well,
I mean there's,

1995
01:53:24.261 --> 01:53:26.660
you ideally never do the same show twice.

1996
01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:30.830
So I think for me and the first couple it was all about how do I do the same

1997
01:53:30.831 --> 01:53:32.660
thing every time like acting or something.

1998
01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:36.800
Like how do I replicate the same thing and then as I grow more as a comedian I'm

1999
01:53:36.801 --> 01:53:41.801
like how do I not do the same thing in a perfunctory phoned in way every time.

2000
01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:42.280
Right.

2001
01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:47.280
How do you have just a real present performance and then also be aware that

2002
01:53:47.661 --> 01:53:48.910
you're filming this.
Yes.

2003
01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:53.420
How do I like nail it but also like be fresh and surprise myself.

2004
01:53:53.450 --> 01:53:55.550
Isn't that why it's important to do more than one show in a night?

2005
01:53:55.551 --> 01:53:59.450
I think that's super important.
I actually did one show Friday watch Saturday.

2006
01:53:59.690 --> 01:54:02.540
That's great.
Yeah,
it was actually great.
I mean that's the benefit of HBO has,

2007
01:54:02.541 --> 01:54:03.321
they have a little more money.

2008
01:54:03.321 --> 01:54:06.170
But that was helpful to me because the first show was just working out the kinks

2009
01:54:06.171 --> 01:54:09.560
with the camera guys so that you know you do a great performance and God forbid

2010
01:54:09.561 --> 01:54:11.060
they don't want to catch it and you're like fuck,

2011
01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:13.310
but you're really trying to catch lightening in a bottle and a special,

2012
01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:16.670
I mean when you do one show,

2013
01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:21.200
do you ever see Bill Hicks is relentless?
I mean,
yeah,

2014
01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:22.633
it's on Youtube.

2015
01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:27.440
It's kind of flat and one of the reasons why it's kind of flat as he did one

2016
01:54:27.441 --> 01:54:31.220
show in a theater in London and it was for HBO.

2017
01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:35.470
So it's like this one didn't do too.
No one.

2018
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:37.310
Also the same thing with multicam.

2019
01:54:37.311 --> 01:54:40.280
I think a lot of the reason people think multicam suck is that it's like,

2020
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:44.180
it's like filming a play,
being there,
stand up is meant to be live.

2021
01:54:44.590 --> 01:54:47.750
It's if you're watching it on Netflix or if you're watching an HBO,

2022
01:54:47.751 --> 01:54:49.670
you're getting like an in its second iteration.

2023
01:54:49.671 --> 01:54:51.920
Like it's always going to lose 40% of the magic.
I mean,

2024
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:56.540
you go see Joe Rogan at the,
uh,
um,

2025
01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:59.750
fucking comedy works.
You're dying every joke,
clapping,

2026
01:54:59.751 --> 01:55:02.720
fucking slapping her knee going crazy and then you watch it and you're like

2027
01:55:02.721 --> 01:55:04.760
laughing out loud.
But it's just the different,

2028
01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:08.240
we are not in the flesh in front of me.
Yeah.
You're not caught up in the trance.

2029
01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:11.570
You're not in that five.
Same with multi cams.
Like,
you know,

2030
01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:15.980
we'll shoot like an um,
uh,
an episode of something and I swear when it's there,

2031
01:55:15.981 --> 01:55:18.020
it's funny.
We're all like,
that was so funny.

2032
01:55:18.021 --> 01:55:20.510
The audience is going crazy and everyone's laughing and then you go see it in

2033
01:55:20.511 --> 01:55:22.850
the editing room and you're like so much funny.

2034
01:55:22.851 --> 01:55:27.851
If you'd been there always this weird about being there while someone's

2035
01:55:27.921 --> 01:55:31.730
performing music too.
You know,
you go to like really good music,

2036
01:55:31.731 --> 01:55:33.890
you like really good music and you listen to it,
it's great.

2037
01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:36.010
But if you go see someone do it live,
it's like,

2038
01:55:38.530 --> 01:55:42.140
I rarely get to see people perform like music wise.
I mean seal,

2039
01:55:42.141 --> 01:55:44.070
I see a lot of standup.
It's so rare that I get

2040
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.780
<v 2>to see music.</v>

2041
01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:48.170
<v 0>I went and saw,
um,
Justin,
Tim,
when I was in Vegas at a year,</v>

2042
01:55:48.171 --> 01:55:51.520
we're in Vegas a lot of times at the same time.
We,
I was in Vegas,
uh,

2043
01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:54.380
and after the show I went and saw Justin Timberlake and I was like,

2044
01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:58.250
after the show?
After my show,
yeah.
And then I went,
he does a three hour show.

2045
01:55:58.251 --> 01:56:01.310
By the way,
Jesus creed.
It's three hours.
It was dancing the entire time.

2046
01:56:01.311 --> 01:56:02.031
Like Michael Jackson.

2047
01:56:02.031 --> 01:56:05.540
I had to sit down 45 minutes of watching his show cause my backyard,

2048
01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:09.260
and he was dancing for three hours.
That motherfucker does not play.

2049
01:56:09.290 --> 01:56:11.900
I want to know what he's up to,
what he's putting in his joints.

2050
01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:17.120
He's at semen.
It really is very tissue regenerating.

2051
01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:19.460
No,
in that case,
I'd be 12 feet tall.

2052
01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:25.100
And so I was watching him.
I was just like,

2053
01:56:25.101 --> 01:56:29.330
holy fuck.
Like I was like,
he is amazing.
Like he,

2054
01:56:29.630 --> 01:56:32.840
he dazzled me.
I was dazzled and I was like,

2055
01:56:32.841 --> 01:56:35.180
is it news to you that Justin Timberlake is talented?
And I was like,
no,

2056
01:56:35.181 --> 01:56:38.140
I'm just used to seeing it on tiny screens.
Right,
right.
You know,
I'm you.

2057
01:56:38.141 --> 01:56:39.450
That's the same reason that you know,

2058
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:41.930
people can come up to us in airports and go,
Joe,
what's up man?

2059
01:56:41.931 --> 01:56:43.130
What did you fucking eat for breakfast?

2060
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:46.850
We're on small screens and then when an actor's on big screens,

2061
01:56:46.851 --> 01:56:49.100
people that come got to look over that.
That's Brad Pitt.
They don't go up to him.

2062
01:56:49.101 --> 01:56:50.120
Ask him what he's eating.

2063
01:56:50.210 --> 01:56:53.270
Do you ever take a picture with people and you feel them shaking?
Yes.

2064
01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:56.990
How weird is this?
Very,
very feel.
Their,
their body shaking.

2065
01:56:57.020 --> 01:56:58.820
It's just so weird to me because I don't,

2066
01:56:58.870 --> 01:57:03.320
I have such career body dysmorphia but also career dysmorphia and it varies.

2067
01:57:03.321 --> 01:57:04.280
Shocking.
I'm always like,

2068
01:57:04.580 --> 01:57:06.920
she thinks I'm sure as a Lumberman who does she think I am?

2069
01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:11.370
<v 2>Well,
women like are really powerful woman.
Like you,
like women.
Like,
oh my God,</v>

2070
01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:13.800
you're right.
They're like,
yeah,
I love you.
You're my idol.

2071
01:57:13.801 --> 01:57:15.630
Like you wouldn't want to be like,

2072
01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:18.930
a lot of women want to be assertive and powerful and they want,

2073
01:57:19.130 --> 01:57:21.960
they just want to feel confident and they look at you.
You're on stage,

2074
01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:25.410
you're talking about sex and you're talking all this crazy shit and you're

2075
01:57:25.411 --> 01:57:28.760
saying it in a funny way and people are laughing and you have that.

2076
01:57:28.770 --> 01:57:32.750
Your assertion and the way you're annunciating is all this clear and the,

2077
01:57:32.751 --> 01:57:35.160
I can't do that shit.
You know,
and then

2078
01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:39.530
<v 0>I cannot,
no.
Oh,
I'm so scared and insecure.
I can't not do standup.</v>

2079
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:43.970
I'm the opposite.
I'm so terrified of being invisible and no one,

2080
01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:48.320
I literally do stand up out of weakness,
not abstract,
but I do not operate.

2081
01:57:48.321 --> 01:57:51.680
My motives are completely out of like insecurity and fear.
It's funny though,

2082
01:57:51.681 --> 01:57:53.330
the talk about Indian mid dot though.

2083
01:57:53.331 --> 01:57:57.170
That's what makes it really rare because most people who would feel those things

2084
01:57:57.171 --> 01:58:00.530
would just like shut up.
Yeah.
Put 'em in a closet there.
Good point.

2085
01:58:00.531 --> 01:58:05.420
I need to fucking hammer boards on the closet.
I need to work on line more.
Um,

2086
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:07.070
I did try to impress you today.

2087
01:58:07.071 --> 01:58:10.790
I put a eyeliner or a eyebrow pencil on and I feel like if melting off,

2088
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:14.950
press me not to.
I'm a big fan of eyebrows.
Really.
No,
you're right.

2089
01:58:15.140 --> 01:58:19.580
It does is I don't even know yet the entire dot till I had to look at the one

2090
01:58:19.581 --> 01:58:21.800
eyebrow to not look in your eyes.
I see what that would be like.

2091
01:58:21.801 --> 01:58:24.710
I just noticed that you had eyebrows.
No eye contact.
No,
but I mean,

2092
01:58:24.711 --> 01:58:28.640
I stand up for me is completely fear driven.
It's not confidence.
I'm good.

2093
01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:29.533
I'm doing,

2094
01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:34.550
I'm afraid that I feel like you've never done what you just did before.
Yes,

2095
01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:38.150
definitely.
I'm out of Ammo.
I so can't remember.

2096
01:58:38.151 --> 01:58:40.860
Does your wife fill in her eyebrows?
I don't know.
I don't know your wife at all.

2097
01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:44.140
That's so funny that there's that.
You don't know that about your wife?
Um,

2098
01:58:44.230 --> 01:58:47.010
I want to ask questions.
Yeah,
smart.
Uh,
they,

2099
01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:52.210
I sometimes at night smoke weed and start plucking my eyebrows and then I wake

2100
01:58:52.211 --> 01:58:55.360
up the next morning and they're just half the size and I'm just like,
fuck,

2101
01:58:55.810 --> 01:58:58.840
did I get a new face last night?
So I put the tweezers,

2102
01:58:58.841 --> 01:59:00.790
I can't smoke weed and have tweezers in the house.

2103
01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:04.960
And then so like three nights ago I tweeze like an entire chunk out of my

2104
01:59:04.961 --> 01:59:09.040
eyebrows type to fill it in with an eyebrow pencil.
Hashtag feminism you should,

2105
01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:11.380
you should smoke weed and do yoga.
Maybe you would like it.

2106
01:59:11.381 --> 01:59:14.860
Then here's the problem with me and exercise.
I really like to feel,

2107
01:59:14.861 --> 01:59:19.360
I need to feel some kind of pain and feel like I'm burning so many calories.

2108
01:59:19.620 --> 01:59:22.500
<v 2>Think of Yoga is exercise.
There you go.</v>

2109
01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:27.060
Smart as body maintenance smart because of the stretching,
moving meditation.

2110
01:59:27.061 --> 01:59:30.030
For me it's been,
it's like really helpful for me mentally,

2111
01:59:30.330 --> 01:59:34.530
but it's also really helpful for my body because everything I do is like,
yes,

2112
01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:37.500
yes.
It's all explosion.
Fucking,
yeah,

2113
01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:42.580
<v 0>well just stretching especially because mobile people,
which I have,</v>

2114
01:59:42.581 --> 01:59:45.190
which is that we use are our bones instead of our muscles,

2115
01:59:45.191 --> 01:59:47.170
which is a lot of people.
It doesn't make any sense to me.

2116
01:59:47.171 --> 01:59:52.171
I don't understand what that means basically means like so I can like like knock

2117
01:59:52.691 --> 01:59:57.380
my hip out of like,
I'm just like too flexible.
Basically my hips are just lab,

2118
01:59:57.381 --> 02:00:01.390
just Janky.
I'm a lemon.
You're very,
yeah,
I'm very flexible.

2119
02:00:01.391 --> 02:00:06.391
My hips can pop out of socket and when I like when I pop out a second and then

2120
02:00:06.611 --> 02:00:09.880
when I um,
like would run and walk,

2121
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:14.590
I would walk with my bones,
my hips and my knees instead of my quad muscles.

2122
02:00:14.591 --> 02:00:15.250
Does that make sense?

2123
02:00:15.250 --> 02:00:18.060
<v 2>You would be a good striker cause it's one of the things that you,</v>

2124
02:00:18.130 --> 02:00:19.580
when you teaching martial arts,

2125
02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:23.950
one of the things I would teach people them back when I used to teach is you got

2126
02:00:23.951 --> 02:00:27.220
to think about you're using your bones.
Don't think about your muscle,

2127
02:00:27.790 --> 02:00:29.170
think about fighting with your bones.

2128
02:00:29.171 --> 02:00:34.171
Yeah because that's the way to do it correctly is like mechanically you have to

2129
02:00:35.471 --> 02:00:36.430
be using your bones.

2130
02:00:36.431 --> 02:00:39.690
You can't think about using your muscles cause then you're like ah yes

2131
02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:43.360
everything becomes circular and she's trying to use your muscles but we were

2132
02:00:43.361 --> 02:00:47.140
trying to use your bones.
Everything is like done correctly.

2133
02:00:47.141 --> 02:00:48.220
If you do it correctly,

2134
02:00:48.250 --> 02:00:51.790
interest as much more effortless than it seems like if you watch like some of

2135
02:00:51.791 --> 02:00:55.130
the best strikers,
they strike in a sort of an effortless way.

2136
02:00:55.140 --> 02:00:58.660
Miss the guys that do it kinetically and they use a lot of muscle that get the

2137
02:00:58.661 --> 02:01:03.250
job done,
but efficiency like the best way to do it efficiently.

2138
02:01:03.410 --> 02:01:07.180
It's kind of been mapped out and the way they do it correctly,

2139
02:01:07.181 --> 02:01:09.940
it's almost like seems counterintuitive.
But you're using your skeleton.

2140
02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:12.370
<v 0>Do you know Martin Snow?
No,</v>

2141
02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:15.910
he's got a gym called Trinity,
uh,

2142
02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:20.130
boxing on Melrose I think.
And his was,
he was um,

2143
02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:21.850
helping me with the,

2144
02:01:21.851 --> 02:01:24.700
what are those little things you put in pools that help you float?
Floating.

2145
02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:29.860
He would hit me.
Punched the floaty thing.
Boxing trainers.
Yeah,
exactly.

2146
02:01:29.861 --> 02:01:32.770
So that I would do,
so I would do that.

2147
02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:36.040
What exactly what you're talking about because I would try to hit to,

2148
02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:39.980
cause I'm too much.
I'm alive,
I'm too

2149
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:42.170
<v 1>much.
But yeah,
so I was putting so much</v>

2150
02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:46.470
<v 3>pressure on my knees and my hips and my ass.
I had no ass development at all.</v>

2151
02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:49.650
Like I wouldn't use my ass.
I would use my back if I was going to live something,

2152
02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:52.560
I would use my vertebrae.
Dangerous.
Yes.
Instead of,

2153
02:01:52.561 --> 02:01:54.990
and then what happens is if your debt over time,

2154
02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:57.060
that's how we get non collision injuries.

2155
02:01:57.061 --> 02:01:59.820
When you just add 55 you sneeze and throw out your back.

2156
02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:02.970
It's just so much pressure is built up on your bonds micro.

2157
02:02:02.971 --> 02:02:06.330
You know when people are like I just sat on the couch and throughout my neck,

2158
02:02:06.750 --> 02:02:07.610
you know,
stuff like that.

2159
02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:10.670
<v 1>I did that once in the fucking in the shower.</v>

2160
02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:14.690
I like turned to grab the shampoo or something like that.

2161
02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:19.340
Ah Yes.
Yeah.
Just hits you.
But it's a straw that breaks the camel's back.

2162
02:02:19.341 --> 02:02:20.900
It's like the straw that breaks the camel's back.

2163
02:02:20.901 --> 02:02:25.340
And I had to drive to Vegas and this is a long time ago in my car driving.

2164
02:02:25.370 --> 02:02:27.380
I remember I couldn't turn around and look behind me.

2165
02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:31.670
So when I had to look behind me I'd literally have to [inaudible].

2166
02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:36.680
So for you is yoga about stretching and my mind too,

2167
02:02:36.890 --> 02:02:40.760
I know my mind cause it cause I have the same sort of internal dialogue issues

2168
02:02:40.761 --> 02:02:44.610
and I'm sure you probably do.
So I just dialogue.
That means you have to,

2169
02:02:45.410 --> 02:02:49.000
there's a bunch of people that's a monologue.
Animals and

2170
02:02:50.630 --> 02:02:53.760
plants.
There's all sorts of shit going on there.
Yeah.
As elves,

2171
02:02:54.650 --> 02:02:58.670
there's lot of stuff going on in my head that's about keeping it together.
Yeah.

2172
02:02:58.700 --> 02:02:59.720
That's what it's about.

2173
02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:02.530
<v 3>No,
I know that that's the next thing.
I just,</v>

2174
02:03:02.531 --> 02:03:04.660
I have so many prejudices against Yoga I have yet.

2175
02:03:04.661 --> 02:03:07.330
You might be the first person I have yet to meet someone who does yoga,

2176
02:03:07.331 --> 02:03:08.530
who is not batshit crazy

2177
02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:10.610
<v 1>or annoying or knowing,
oh,</v>

2178
02:03:10.770 --> 02:03:13.860
I can literally every whole foods parking lot is a bunch of people with yoga

2179
02:03:13.861 --> 02:03:15.460
mats being complete asshole.
I'm like,

2180
02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:18.000
just cause you have the yoga mat doesn't mean you're cool.

2181
02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:21.090
Like it's fair that I've meet someone who does yoga,

2182
02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:24.510
who abides by the principles of yoga at all.
It's hard.

2183
02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:28.650
You can find this all like anorexic,
unemployed people.
What's also where we live.

2184
02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:29.750
That's true.

2185
02:03:29.751 --> 02:03:32.520
We live in a place where everybody's trying to reinvent themselves or pretend to

2186
02:03:32.521 --> 02:03:35.640
be something.
We create this false narrative that's,
that's,

2187
02:03:35.940 --> 02:03:40.020
that's a giant part of why we're here.
We are.
We're in this like magnet.
Okay.

2188
02:03:40.021 --> 02:03:45.021
This Hollywood attention magnet and all these metal filings use people that just

2189
02:03:45.340 --> 02:03:47.430
so desperately want to be special.

2190
02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:50.790
They come to this place and if they don't feel like they're special,
they go,

2191
02:03:50.791 --> 02:03:52.380
well that guy seems special.
What's he doing?

2192
02:03:52.381 --> 02:03:56.030
Well he's wearing wooden beads and he likes yoga.
I got some of the wrongdoing.

2193
02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:59.940
No mass day I'm doing,
yeah,
I'm eating Tofu.
I don't even,
I don't,
yeah,

2194
02:03:59.941 --> 02:04:02.820
no animals were harmed.
Modified.
It's,
no.
Yeah,

2195
02:04:02.930 --> 02:04:05.150
<v 3>I and I also am like at this place,
I don't know where you are on this.</v>

2196
02:04:05.151 --> 02:04:08.420
I'm like on self improvement overwhelm.
So it's like,

2197
02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:12.320
it's by the time I do all the things I need to do to improve myself.

2198
02:04:12.321 --> 02:04:17.300
It's like four 30 by the time you go to like therapy and work out and meditate

2199
02:04:17.301 --> 02:04:18.920
and yoga.
It's like I don't even have time to,

2200
02:04:18.950 --> 02:04:21.560
it's a full time job to try to take care of yourself.

2201
02:04:21.700 --> 02:04:24.340
<v 1>It's definitely a full time job if you do it right and that's why it's really</v>

2202
02:04:24.341 --> 02:04:27.400
hard for people that have full time jobs.
Yeah.
To take care of themselves.

2203
02:04:27.401 --> 02:04:31.100
You find it overwhelming.
Yeah.
We get out of shape,
you get tired.
You know,

2204
02:04:31.101 --> 02:04:32.800
you can't indulge in hobbies.

2205
02:04:33.070 --> 02:04:37.500
If you're a full time job and you have a family and God forbid you're behind on

2206
02:04:37.501 --> 02:04:38.160
your bills,

2207
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:41.130
<v 2>so then you have to work over time or pick up a second job.</v>

2208
02:04:41.330 --> 02:04:45.740
<v 3>Like it's a luxury to not be crazy and it's a luxury to not have like the body</v>

2209
02:04:45.741 --> 02:04:50.120
trauma and to hurt your,
you know,
it's like I go to this woman who helps me cry,

2210
02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:55.340
you know,
the grit woman to help the crime.
This Israeli can help you cry.

2211
02:04:58.610 --> 02:05:02.330
I was like,
see,
I just figured out what was wrong with me.
I thought that was hot.

2212
02:05:03.710 --> 02:05:07.430
I just learned everything I need to know about myself.

2213
02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:11.400
I failed that Roderick Tass um,
she,
um,
her whole thing is that you,
um,

2214
02:05:11.450 --> 02:05:14.420
your basically your body's a blueprint to everything that ever happened to you

2215
02:05:14.421 --> 02:05:15.260
and as a kid,

2216
02:05:15.261 --> 02:05:18.860
all the trauma and emotions that you were pressed or like held in your muscles

2217
02:05:19.010 --> 02:05:21.980
and because of our bodies react faster than our brains.

2218
02:05:21.981 --> 02:05:25.040
Is that true to something that if as a kid,

2219
02:05:25.041 --> 02:05:29.360
if I was abused and I used to do this,
I'm flinching.
For those of you listening,

2220
02:05:29.650 --> 02:05:32.690
uh,
as an adult,
if I flinch at something,

2221
02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:35.450
all of a sudden it's going to signal my hippocampus.
They make bill,

2222
02:05:35.451 --> 02:05:37.920
it tells me hippocampus,
something bad is happening.
Even if it's not okay.

2223
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:40.980
<v 2>You know,
for thinking shit,
is that possible?
Probably.</v>

2224
02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:44.170
You go to a chick to make you cry.
Go for a jog.

2225
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:48.720
<v 3>Cried until I was like 27 what?
I never cried.
I never,</v>

2226
02:05:48.721 --> 02:05:52.350
so I have all this like the bane of my existence.
Real estate.
No,

2227
02:05:52.351 --> 02:05:55.710
that's why you're healthy and that it's release.
Crying is a solution.

2228
02:05:55.740 --> 02:05:56.573
Not a problem.

2229
02:05:56.690 --> 02:05:59.780
<v 2>Yeah.
Well I don't cry about,
shoot with me though.
That's what's weird.</v>

2230
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:02.150
You didn't happen to me.
Doesn't make me cry.

2231
02:06:02.540 --> 02:06:04.340
Interesting Shit that happens to other people,

2232
02:06:04.940 --> 02:06:09.540
other people's tragedies and bads and even sometimes positive things,
right?

2233
02:06:10.150 --> 02:06:10.840
<v 3>That's healthy.</v>

2234
02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:14.400
I learned that crying is a weakness and you're not allowed to cry.

2235
02:06:14.401 --> 02:06:15.540
And if you do cry,

2236
02:06:15.690 --> 02:06:18.540
you're going to attract attention of dangerous people who are just going to make

2237
02:06:18.541 --> 02:06:20.760
things worse.
So just like pretend like everything's fine.

2238
02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:22.260
<v 2>Well I think that this,</v>

2239
02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:27.300
that there's whatever crying is this overwhelming emotion that that is also like

2240
02:06:27.721 --> 02:06:32.460
horsepower but overwhelming emotion when it's manifested itself or when,

2241
02:06:32.461 --> 02:06:37.461
when it's manifested in a positive way or like when you turn it on and use it in

2242
02:06:38.581 --> 02:06:42.330
some way like you'll for something else.
Well I think when someone says to you,

2243
02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:46.800
this is like your thing,
right?
That you're a lot with this.
That's what that is.

2244
02:06:46.801 --> 02:06:47.910
What they're saying is,

2245
02:06:47.911 --> 02:06:50.250
I mean even though it makes you feel uncomfortable because you're insecure

2246
02:06:50.251 --> 02:06:52.890
because you have this like the self judging thing.

2247
02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:55.320
What that is is you got a lot of fucking horsepower.

2248
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:57.070
There's a lot of shit going on.
It's a lot of it.

2249
02:06:57.210 --> 02:07:00.420
So when you funnel that stuff into something,

2250
02:07:00.421 --> 02:07:03.630
you can achieve spectacular results.

2251
02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:08.850
And that a lot of people that are like doll or they're,
they're just,

2252
02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:13.230
there's not much going on there.
They can't do that.
Yeah.
You know,

2253
02:07:13.231 --> 02:07:17.470
and that's the difference.
Like it will overwhelm you in a negative way.
It'll it,

2254
02:07:17.540 --> 02:07:20.270
it'll fucking burn your house down if you don't control it.
Yeah.

2255
02:07:20.430 --> 02:07:23.520
But whatever it is,
when you focus in on something,

2256
02:07:23.521 --> 02:07:25.500
you can do some shit that other people can't do.

2257
02:07:25.710 --> 02:07:29.770
But then it's like this balancing act of trying to keep this fucking tiger in

2258
02:07:29.970 --> 02:07:34.700
under control.
Yeah.
And that's that tiger is your mind,
your emotions,
your,

2259
02:07:34.710 --> 02:07:37.690
your being,
whatever the fuck you are.
You know?

2260
02:07:37.691 --> 02:07:41.970
And some people just have more of it.
There's some people that are just more Olin

2261
02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:45.270
<v 3>pure.
And I would interested in your take on this is that I wonder if,</v>

2262
02:07:45.450 --> 02:07:49.500
because I was very nervous when I like decided,
okay,
I'm going to to heal my,

2263
02:07:49.501 --> 02:07:51.240
I'm going to fix all these invisible wounds.

2264
02:07:51.241 --> 02:07:54.760
I'm going to like fix all this brokenness of like,
will I still be funny?
Well,

2265
02:07:54.761 --> 02:07:57.570
I still be ambitious.
Oh to a real problem with that.
When I was young,
I'm,

2266
02:07:57.750 --> 02:07:59.610
what if I get mentally healthy while I still be funny

2267
02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:04.110
<v 2>tap dance for people.
When I was like in my early twenties,
I used to like,</v>

2268
02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:08.400
there was always the concept that I would always chase as a martial artist,

2269
02:08:08.401 --> 02:08:10.290
the chase,
this concept of enlightenment,

2270
02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:14.760
this unachievable goal of being complete total control of your mind and being

2271
02:08:14.761 --> 02:08:19.680
present at all times and being just absent of weakness.
Right.

2272
02:08:19.710 --> 02:08:21.510
You,
you,
you fix yourself.

2273
02:08:21.511 --> 02:08:25.830
You get to this point where you're operating this pure zen state in competition.

2274
02:08:25.831 --> 02:08:28.000
That's what I chased all throughout my,

2275
02:08:28.050 --> 02:08:31.710
my youth and all through my teenage years up until I started doing comedy.

2276
02:08:31.950 --> 02:08:34.030
And then when I started doing comedy,
I,
uh,

2277
02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:36.180
I was at this weird place where I was like,

2278
02:08:36.810 --> 02:08:41.810
I shouldn't like try to meditate and I shouldn't try to calm myself because I

2279
02:08:42.151 --> 02:08:44.430
should be kind of fucked up.
Cause that's all the great ones.

2280
02:08:44.431 --> 02:08:47.610
Like whether it was prior or Kinison,
which is,
they're all fucked up.
Yup.

2281
02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:48.633
Lenny Bruce,

2282
02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:53.820
<v 3>Dow gray prior would have been if he was a little more sober.
How long?
Much?
La,</v>

2283
02:08:53.821 --> 02:08:58.710
who knows?
I don't know,
but I was like,
okay,
I cannot,
um,

2284
02:08:59.430 --> 02:09:03.510
I mean I'm killing myself.
Right.
It's like,
I can't live this way anymore.
And if,

2285
02:09:03.511 --> 02:09:06.360
if,
if I'm only doing comedy because I'm fucked up,

2286
02:09:06.361 --> 02:09:08.940
I probably shouldn't be doing comedy.
That's the club.
You know,

2287
02:09:09.570 --> 02:09:13.820
like Scott Wieland's wife was talking about,
yeah,
we're fine.

2288
02:09:13.890 --> 02:09:17.730
Tragedy and glorifying elimination addiction.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know,

2289
02:09:17.790 --> 02:09:21.900
actually that fucking drug,
God dammit.
I hate that.
Fucking nineties.

2290
02:09:22.410 --> 02:09:23.243
So nine.
Yep.

2291
02:09:23.790 --> 02:09:26.430
<v 2>It's 2015 now because all the people that are addicted to pills,</v>

2292
02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:30.900
Anthony Bordain did a show recently about Massachusetts and one of the things

2293
02:09:30.901 --> 02:09:34.740
that they were talking about in the Massachusetts show 'em of his show,

2294
02:09:34.741 --> 02:09:39.270
I'm on Coleman,
Howard's moving car parts unknown.
Um,

2295
02:09:40.570 --> 02:09:40.780
he,

2296
02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:44.340
he was talking about these people who they were interviewing because you know,

2297
02:09:44.341 --> 02:09:48.060
Anthony had a serious heroin problem when he was younger and he was talking

2298
02:09:48.061 --> 02:09:52.350
about all these people that became addicted to heroin because they got on pills

2299
02:09:52.740 --> 02:09:56.490
and it was so easy to get.
And then they were prescribing and like fucking crazy.

2300
02:09:56.510 --> 02:09:59.820
Yeah.
When I got my nose fixed,
my doctor prescribed me two different opioids.

2301
02:10:00.450 --> 02:10:03.930
Yeah.
What?
And I didn't take any of it.
I was like,
man,
my nose doesn't even hurt,

2302
02:10:03.931 --> 02:10:07.650
man.
Yeah.
It was like mildly uncomfortable once it was done.

2303
02:10:07.950 --> 02:10:12.950
But they get that addiction and then they change the laws,

2304
02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:15.240
made it much more difficult to get the pills.

2305
02:10:15.241 --> 02:10:17.760
And then people got desperate because they were addicted and they need it.

2306
02:10:17.761 --> 02:10:21.420
And then they went to heroin and they were talking about this overwhelming

2307
02:10:21.421 --> 02:10:25.280
heroin issue in western Massachusetts.
I guess a lot of parts of our country.

2308
02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:28.070
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean a lot.
I mean,
just the more I learned about addiction,</v>

2309
02:10:28.071 --> 02:10:32.320
this Garrett are more scared I got because a lot of it is genetic too.
You know,

2310
02:10:32.330 --> 02:10:36.380
they say,
um,
uh,
genetics loads.
The gun environment pulls the trigger for drugs,

2311
02:10:36.381 --> 02:10:39.810
you know,
so I know that's in my genetics.
It's a tattoo.

2312
02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:44.090
Some really hot girl who I met Ahmed dates.

2313
02:10:49.450 --> 02:10:52.140
Um,
and uh,

2314
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:56.660
I know that because I am an addict,
I just,
my drug is not substances.

2315
02:10:56.661 --> 02:11:01.270
My drug is control and work and people who aren't,
you know,
and adrenaline do,

2316
02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:01.461
you know,

2317
02:11:01.461 --> 02:11:04.850
because adrenaline is an addictive substance and you can get addicted to

2318
02:11:04.851 --> 02:11:09.010
adrenaline in Utero if your mother is under stress,
it's called,
um,

2319
02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:10.250
epigenetic imprinting,

2320
02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:13.670
whatever chemicals that your mother is producing and you'd order your,

2321
02:11:13.671 --> 02:11:18.380
so if your mother in Utero is producing,
uh,
the adrenaline and cortisol,

2322
02:11:18.381 --> 02:11:19.820
you're going to get addicted to that very young.

2323
02:11:19.821 --> 02:11:24.800
So I was an adrenaline addict when I was out of the gate.
And so,
uh,
yeah,
so

2324
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:28.700
<v 2>Michael Irvin was telling me that Michael Irvin was telling me about the problem</v>

2325
02:11:28.701 --> 02:11:31.610
with young kids that were raised in really

2326
02:11:33.110 --> 02:11:34.460
horrible environments,

2327
02:11:34.461 --> 02:11:38.120
violence and crime and we constantly in fight and flight mode when you were

2328
02:11:38.121 --> 02:11:39.470
around violence all the time,

2329
02:11:39.471 --> 02:11:44.060
your body just becomes a engineered to handle that yes.
From the wound.

2330
02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:45.690
<v 3>Yes.
And I found that I,</v>

2331
02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:49.000
and this is sort of what half of what I'm in recovery for is that,
um,

2332
02:11:49.110 --> 02:11:53.700
I found that I felt very comfortable in dangerous situations and in completely

2333
02:11:53.701 --> 02:11:55.440
benign situations felt fear.

2334
02:11:55.770 --> 02:11:59.910
<v 2>Do you think that's because in dangerous situations it's like the circumstances</v>

2335
02:11:59.911 --> 02:12:00.610
are already late.

2336
02:12:00.610 --> 02:12:03.620
<v 3>Familiar.
I know how to handle this.
Yeah.
Right.
In drug addict,</v>

2337
02:12:03.670 --> 02:12:06.300
someone being abusive,
violent.
This is my comfort zone,
right?

2338
02:12:06.301 --> 02:12:09.270
This has given me the,
uh,
adrenaline quota that I need.

2339
02:12:09.271 --> 02:12:11.250
This is what I'm designed for.
I'm in the ring.

2340
02:12:11.251 --> 02:12:14.070
I only know how to live with my gloves on when the gloves are off.

2341
02:12:14.250 --> 02:12:16.380
That's when I could concern cause I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.

2342
02:12:16.490 --> 02:12:19.570
<v 2>And then you're also in your own head and it's like spiral out of control.</v>

2343
02:12:20.220 --> 02:12:24.240
<v 3>Hyper vigilant,
hypervigilant,</v>

2344
02:12:24.610 --> 02:12:25.443
you know?

2345
02:12:25.770 --> 02:12:30.770
And because in my own growing up silence meant it's a calm before the storm.

2346
02:12:31.270 --> 02:12:34.890
Oh Man.
Things were calm and men,
someone's about to come home drunk.

2347
02:12:34.891 --> 02:12:37.140
Someone's about to Shit's about to hit the fan.

2348
02:12:37.290 --> 02:12:39.060
So it's very hard for me to relax,

2349
02:12:39.061 --> 02:12:41.850
which is probably why yoga is hard for me cause it's like when's the other shoe

2350
02:12:41.851 --> 02:12:42.684
going to drop?

2351
02:12:42.710 --> 02:12:46.290
<v 2>Well,
you know,
it's interesting,
the PTSD is a huge problem with soldiers.</v>

2352
02:12:46.291 --> 02:12:50.040
But yeah,
I talked to a lot of guys that were special forces guys,

2353
02:12:50.041 --> 02:12:54.000
like special ops with the Rangers or Green Berets or navy seals.

2354
02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:56.410
They don't have nearly as much of a problem.
Interesting.

2355
02:12:56.490 --> 02:12:58.930
Because they're the antagonists.
Mm.

2356
02:12:59.010 --> 02:13:00.730
<v 3>Yes sir.
They create the drama</v>

2357
02:13:01.390 --> 02:13:03.490
<v 2>diff guys.
They're going out,
they're in control.</v>

2358
02:13:03.491 --> 02:13:06.370
They're going out and to going there,
hunting down people.

2359
02:13:06.550 --> 02:13:09.530
Whereas the guys were sitting around waiting to be attacked.
Yes.

2360
02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:11.020
Those are the ones that are freaking out.

2361
02:13:11.021 --> 02:13:14.500
Creditors versus the ones who were stationed in a place and they're being

2362
02:13:14.501 --> 02:13:17.900
attacked all the time.
Those guys get rattled in there.
I would also

2363
02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:19.670
<v 3>be fascinated in the special forces.</v>

2364
02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:23.030
A couple of things that interest me about them is that,
number one,

2365
02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:27.080
the ones that have the most PTSD and depression when they come home are the ones

2366
02:13:27.081 --> 02:13:30.600
that didn't kill anyone because they feel guilt and shame.
Really?
Yup.

2367
02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:34.950
That they kill anyone.
Really?
Yes.
There is this,
I'll send it to you.

2368
02:13:34.951 --> 02:13:38.250
I dated a guy who was really into seals and made a movie about navy seals and

2369
02:13:38.251 --> 02:13:43.080
stuff.
Um,
and then,
uh,
so they probably,
because they're again,

2370
02:13:43.081 --> 02:13:46.560
like the perpetrators like you said.
Um,
and I would imagine,

2371
02:13:46.561 --> 02:13:47.820
I'm curious if it's chicken or an egg,

2372
02:13:47.821 --> 02:13:50.580
the guy that the guys that end up being navy seals if there,

2373
02:13:50.581 --> 02:13:52.560
I don't want to say sociopathic that's being extreme,

2374
02:13:52.561 --> 02:13:57.060
but like if they became seals because they have less of a,

2375
02:13:57.150 --> 02:13:58.890
they're less sensitive,
you know what I mean?

2376
02:13:58.891 --> 02:14:01.080
Cause the guys that make an aren't always the toughest of the biggest and the

2377
02:14:01.081 --> 02:14:03.090
strongest and the fastest.
It's the most emotionally tough.

2378
02:14:03.330 --> 02:14:08.330
So if you become a seal or you already predisposed to be less traumatized,

2379
02:14:09.370 --> 02:14:12.550
<v 2>well there's a,
that's the case with a lot of fighters as well.</v>

2380
02:14:12.551 --> 02:14:16.390
There's a lot of really physically talented guys that never make it.
They just,

2381
02:14:16.420 --> 02:14:20.500
they fall apart emotionally and they fall apart mentally and they can never,

2382
02:14:20.710 --> 02:14:24.010
they can never achieve greatness.
They get real fucking clothes.

2383
02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:28.180
And there's these guys that we would call Jim Legends were in the gym when

2384
02:14:28.181 --> 02:14:32.350
there's no stakes,
it's not difficult.
They fucking shine.
They look fantastic.

2385
02:14:32.610 --> 02:14:36.180
<v 3>It's like people,
actors who are good at auditions.
Yeah.
Some are,
some aren't.</v>

2386
02:14:36.181 --> 02:14:38.740
Some are good with this weird,
uh,

2387
02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.870
an authentic thing and they have to perfor I mean

2388
02:14:41.950 --> 02:14:45.720
<v 2>comics who are hilarious in the parking lot bomb on stage.
Yes.
You think it.
Yes,</v>

2389
02:14:45.850 --> 02:14:49.630
<v 3>totally.
Do you think that it is a,
um,
level of Nar?
I mean,</v>

2390
02:14:49.631 --> 02:14:53.770
I've been around,
you've been around more athletes and I have,
but um,
what,

2391
02:14:53.771 --> 02:14:57.700
I haven't dated a couple of athletes.
There's this disconnect,

2392
02:14:57.730 --> 02:15:02.730
this lack of empathy and I dare I say narcissism that I don't know if must work

2393
02:15:04.151 --> 02:15:06.700
for them in order to become an elite athlete.

2394
02:15:06.701 --> 02:15:09.730
I would imagine you'd have to have a healthy level of like narcissism and ego.

2395
02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:14.210
<v 2>I think there's probably something in the,
I think ego and athletes,</v>

2396
02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:18.560
like it goes so hand in hand,
especially with pro athletes,

2397
02:15:18.830 --> 02:15:20.600
it's so hand in hand that you gotta think,
man,

2398
02:15:20.630 --> 02:15:23.320
there's gotta be some sort of connection there.
Here's where it gets interesting.

2399
02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:26.330
Illusional on some level doing a lot of ways.
Yeah,
I'm invincible.

2400
02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:29.660
But here's where it gets interesting with fighters.
It's not the case.

2401
02:15:30.490 --> 02:15:35.490
The best fighters almost have like sort of a zen ability to block all that

2402
02:15:36.081 --> 02:15:37.940
bullshit out.
They have a belief in themselves,

2403
02:15:38.210 --> 02:15:40.620
but they have a zen ability to block all that shit out.

2404
02:15:40.621 --> 02:15:42.470
And that's why there was some of the most friendly people.

2405
02:15:42.650 --> 02:15:45.080
Some of the best fighters are some of the nicest people you got.

2406
02:15:45.081 --> 02:15:48.020
Like Anderson Silva is one of the fucking nicest guys you'll ever meet.

2407
02:15:48.290 --> 02:15:51.950
He's so friendly and sweet and he's always like hugging people and smiling and

2408
02:15:51.951 --> 02:15:55.460
laughing.
And he was a fucking murderer when he was the champ.
I mean,

2409
02:15:55.461 --> 02:15:57.130
he was one of the best ever.
Yeah.

2410
02:15:57.380 --> 02:15:59.480
Like I could go down the list of some of the best guys.

2411
02:15:59.481 --> 02:16:02.690
Frankie Edgar is one of the best w featherweights in the world.

2412
02:16:02.750 --> 02:16:06.260
Used to be lightweight,
like sweetheart fucking nicest guy.
He's so nice.

2413
02:16:06.261 --> 02:16:08.530
And he's a fucking assassin.
One gun

2414
02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:13.060
<v 3>box or person from the,
I don't know anything about this field,
but,
um,</v>

2415
02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:15.850
my ex had a boxing gym who had,

2416
02:16:15.910 --> 02:16:20.910
I think it was Canelo Canelo Alvarez and he doesn't watch horror movies or only

2417
02:16:21.131 --> 02:16:24.580
watches like will Ferrell,
like sweet,
like,
you know,

2418
02:16:24.610 --> 02:16:29.350
doesn't allow negativity in his brain at all because negativity breeds and

2419
02:16:29.351 --> 02:16:29.980
paranoia and

2420
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.920
<v 0>he doesn't even want to strengthen the part of your brain that even goes there.</v>

2421
02:16:33.110 --> 02:16:37.360
No fucks with a lot of fighters.
Social media,
I can't even imagine.

2422
02:16:37.780 --> 02:16:41.500
I can't even imagine on these message boards and these people calling them

2423
02:16:41.501 --> 02:16:44.230
pussies and faggots and that work for or against,

2424
02:16:44.231 --> 02:16:47.770
you can use that as fuel or do you most of them against them.

2425
02:16:48.130 --> 02:16:49.360
Most of them against,
because their day,

2426
02:16:49.430 --> 02:16:51.100
they're dealing with their own fears constantly.

2427
02:16:51.101 --> 02:16:56.101
So they don't want more like what you are and who are you are in some ways

2428
02:16:56.771 --> 02:17:01.000
defined by what you believe and if you are insecure,

2429
02:17:01.001 --> 02:17:04.270
and then that insecurity gets reinforced by other people calling you a loser.

2430
02:17:04.570 --> 02:17:07.450
You know that guy fucking jokes.
I'm a chunker shit.
You know,

2431
02:17:07.470 --> 02:17:09.230
and then you get in there and you're like,
Fuck God,

2432
02:17:09.370 --> 02:17:14.080
a choker strengthen the neural pathway.
Like my,
I worked with this therapist,

2433
02:17:14.081 --> 02:17:17.290
she's like a trauma therapist and when I was going through a really bad breakup,

2434
02:17:17.470 --> 02:17:19.660
I was not allowed to talk.
What?

2435
02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:23.800
I swear you're going to like this,
you're not allowed to talk.

2436
02:17:24.010 --> 02:17:28.810
I was not allowed to mention the person for 90 days so that the,

2437
02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:31.900
we weaken the neural pathway of even thinking about the person.

2438
02:17:32.110 --> 02:17:34.090
So you're strengthening real.
Yeah.

2439
02:17:34.091 --> 02:17:37.420
You're strengthening neural pathways when you think like when you read tweets

2440
02:17:37.421 --> 02:17:41.350
about it and you're an idiot and whatever those ideas.
Yeah.

2441
02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:43.660
And then it's like the same way you quit coffee,

2442
02:17:43.661 --> 02:17:46.150
it takes 28 days to create a new habit.
Right.

2443
02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:48.010
Cause that's how long it takes to develop an our counseling.

2444
02:17:49.210 --> 02:17:53.500
I think it's 28 for a new neural pathway.
90 for,
I don't know.
You probably,

2445
02:17:53.650 --> 02:17:57.910
you probably know more about this than I do.
I think it depends on the habit.

2446
02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:01.190
Obviously.
We're both saying,
I think,
I think neither one of us fucking nowhere.

2447
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:04.900
Someone Google it and hit us up.
Twitter,

2448
02:18:04.930 --> 02:18:07.460
I read someone's face bar,

2449
02:18:07.461 --> 02:18:10.370
call Neil degrasse Tyson backcheck or not,

2450
02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:15.130
but I know that 28 days is the minimum for Rehab because of that.

2451
02:18:15.131 --> 02:18:17.870
But 90 is really when it really matters.
Well,

2452
02:18:17.890 --> 02:18:20.740
it makes sense that there's pathways for sure,

2453
02:18:20.741 --> 02:18:23.770
because it's one of the hardest things for people to break his habits.

2454
02:18:24.580 --> 02:18:29.500
And that's also like one of the best ways to develop new creative thoughts is to

2455
02:18:29.501 --> 02:18:30.334
do new things.

2456
02:18:30.490 --> 02:18:33.190
Like take yourself completely out of your hundred percent out of your

2457
02:18:33.191 --> 02:18:36.610
environment,
out of your comfort zone.
That says,

2458
02:18:36.611 --> 02:18:40.210
when I'm trying to write something new,

2459
02:18:40.211 --> 02:18:43.880
I'll rearrange the furniture in my house because it just isn't great,

2460
02:18:43.881 --> 02:18:45.530
but it didn't knew like the couches in it.

2461
02:18:45.531 --> 02:18:49.750
It just gets your brain thinking outside of,
I like to go places.
Oh,
that's smart.

2462
02:18:49.870 --> 02:18:52.860
I go places and sometimes I would go places like,
I'll be in my car,
I'm gonna,

2463
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:53.061
you know,

2464
02:18:53.061 --> 02:18:55.930
I'm a fucking drive somewhere I've never been before and just get out of my car.

2465
02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:59.720
Just go somewhere.
I think it's good to just be in a place that you,

2466
02:18:59.750 --> 02:19:03.610
you're not used to just like mix up your brain hall.
You get new perfume.

2467
02:19:03.611 --> 02:19:07.480
That sounds Dorky.
But like,
I know that sounds crazy,
but new smells,
new site,

2468
02:19:07.481 --> 02:19:11.890
new colors,
new everything.
So,
um,
uh,
I won't wear black when I write.
I know.

2469
02:19:11.891 --> 02:19:14.110
That's so stupid.
It might just be superstition.

2470
02:19:15.310 --> 02:19:18.070
I tried to work colors because it stimulates different parts of your brain,

2471
02:19:18.490 --> 02:19:23.140
different colors,
music,
smells,
candles.
If I'm starting a new script,

2472
02:19:23.141 --> 02:19:27.320
I'll have new candles.
Sage,
like stuff that just like stimulates.
You're bringing,

2473
02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:28.220
you know,
Benicio Del

2474
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:32.080
<v 1>Toro.
I'm interested.
I'm Mustang.
Oh No,
no,
no,</v>

2475
02:19:33.930 --> 02:19:38.600
sorry.
Yeah,
I was like,
I know that did seem very random.
Guillermo del Toro,

2476
02:19:38.980 --> 02:19:42.410
which is a fat,
ugly guy,
so don't,
don't have the same thoughts,

2477
02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:47.600
but he's very creative and he,
um,
was doing this thing where he took this,

2478
02:19:47.601 --> 02:19:51.530
uh,
these,
this camera crew minute tour of where he writes and his,
you know,

2479
02:19:51.531 --> 02:19:53.410
he's a horror writer.
Yeah.
So he,

2480
02:19:53.411 --> 02:19:58.411
his office is filled with like all these weird trinkets and objects and statues

2481
02:19:58.851 --> 02:20:01.400
and books and,
and all this cool shit.

2482
02:20:01.401 --> 02:20:04.900
And the reason being is that like he has designed this area,

2483
02:20:04.901 --> 02:20:09.650
this creative space to sort of stimulate his imagination.
Awesome.
Awesome.

2484
02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:13.910
What do you do when you sit down and write?
What's your process?
No,

2485
02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:18.800
we,
that's what I do.

2486
02:20:19.260 --> 02:20:22.400
I get rid of what I write.
So over to,
yeah,
but I,
I like to,

2487
02:20:22.460 --> 02:20:26.780
I like to write so high that I like feel like I have to get the words out before

2488
02:20:26.781 --> 02:20:28.760
they slip away.
Oh,
that's smart.

2489
02:20:28.850 --> 02:20:31.070
Well it's like what you do on stage when you dig a hole for yourself.

2490
02:20:31.071 --> 02:20:32.500
It's almost like sort of,

2491
02:20:32.510 --> 02:20:34.880
but it's obviously there's not as much pressure when you're riding,

2492
02:20:34.881 --> 02:20:39.740
but I feel like when I'm writing I like to get outside of my own comfort,

2493
02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:42.770
my own on my own control.

2494
02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:46.550
Like that's the thing that freaks people out most about pot is the paranoia.

2495
02:20:46.670 --> 02:20:50.510
What do you do?
Sativa or Nica?
I'll do both,
but I like sativa.

2496
02:20:50.540 --> 02:20:54.820
But do you do both?
Pick one for like hanging versus working.
You just,

2497
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:59.510
I just like pot.
Yeah.
Okay.
We notice there's definitely a,

2498
02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:02.720
you investing in a weed thing.
There's something going on right now.

2499
02:21:02.721 --> 02:21:07.250
Talk to you about offstage,
offstage,
pyramid scheme.
No.
How dare you?
I'm joking.

2500
02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:09.730
Um,
I think it's probably a,

2501
02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:13.700
there's probably benefits to both to sativa and Indica.
Yeah.

2502
02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:17.720
Like indic is better for sex.
It's better for food.
It's better for relaxing.

2503
02:21:18.020 --> 02:21:21.380
Sativas I think probably a little bit better for creativity,

2504
02:21:21.381 --> 02:21:24.680
but sometimes it's not sometimes indicates great for us.
They're both good.
Yeah.

2505
02:21:24.681 --> 02:21:28.250
There's not that much of a difference in the effect is there's differences,

2506
02:21:28.251 --> 02:21:33.200
but both of them have very similar,
um,
creative enhancing effects,

2507
02:21:33.201 --> 02:21:34.580
at least to me.
Right.
I'm,

2508
02:21:34.581 --> 02:21:37.290
I'm convinced that everybody has a different reaction to it because I've

2509
02:21:37.570 --> 02:21:41.810
explained my reaction to marijuana to other people and they're like,
what?
Yeah.

2510
02:21:41.930 --> 02:21:43.810
You know,
and then you also have to be

2511
02:21:44.290 --> 02:21:46.420
<v 3>to be as smart as you,
you know what I mean?</v>

2512
02:21:46.421 --> 02:21:48.490
And creative and driven and et cetera.

2513
02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:51.200
<v 1>I think alcohol too,
like I've talked to people that get like,</v>

2514
02:21:51.210 --> 02:21:53.940
I know people that get angry and mean on alcohol.

2515
02:21:53.941 --> 02:21:56.500
Like they want to go out and get him to think that that's,
uh,

2516
02:21:56.670 --> 02:21:58.410
who they really are.
Maybe.

2517
02:21:58.440 --> 02:22:01.110
Do you think that like the truth comes out when your dream?
Maybe we could,

2518
02:22:01.111 --> 02:22:04.460
but I know people that drink in their fucking eyes turned like hamster eyes.

2519
02:22:04.461 --> 02:22:06.690
They're like gloss over there.
Like they're not even there anymore.

2520
02:22:06.730 --> 02:22:09.000
Something happened to me the day

2521
02:22:09.130 --> 02:22:13.030
<v 3>I turned 30,
where I could not drink tequila anymore.
I was like,</v>

2522
02:22:13.060 --> 02:22:15.460
the day I turned 30,
I was like,
I was having like a dinner.

2523
02:22:15.461 --> 02:22:18.520
It was like a birthday or something.
And it was at Chateau Marmont.

2524
02:22:19.150 --> 02:22:21.010
Someone sent over,
um,
uh,

2525
02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:24.250
something like kind of new sent over a Tequila and he was like,

2526
02:22:24.251 --> 02:22:26.100
I bet you can't do shots to kill an icon.

2527
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:26.933
<v 0>Was it bill Cosby?</v>

2528
02:22:30.660 --> 02:22:35.160
No day I woke up with my underwear or insulted that he didn't try to rape me.

2529
02:22:35.161 --> 02:22:38.260
But that's another story.
Um,
that same thing with crux dreammaker.

2530
02:22:38.261 --> 02:22:40.590
Everyone's like,
oh,
did you choose Georgia to hit on you?
I'm like,
no,

2531
02:22:40.591 --> 02:22:45.240
and now I feel bad and so sent over shots and I'm competitive,
so I was like,

2532
02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:50.160
I will crush you.
Wow.
Uh,
I woke up in my bed fully clothed,
looked at my phone,

2533
02:22:50.370 --> 02:22:54.420
80 miss text messages.
Did you go home with John Mayer?
And I was like,

2534
02:22:54.630 --> 02:22:58.290
I'm never drinking Tequila again.
Wow.
Yeah.
When you get it,
when you get a deed,

2535
02:22:58.291 --> 02:23:02.220
you go home with John Mayer.
Was it from a guy or girl?
It was from Oh,

2536
02:23:02.221 --> 02:23:05.040
tons of gun.
It was like,
it was a whole staff I was working with,

2537
02:23:05.041 --> 02:23:07.140
so it was like 30 people texting me.

2538
02:23:07.230 --> 02:23:09.140
You're not going home at John May or we're not going to let you go home.

2539
02:23:09.150 --> 02:23:12.030
What are you doing?
What's your cock block?
I know

2540
02:23:14.250 --> 02:23:18.630
that's a good plan.
I know you do anything for John Mayer.

2541
02:23:18.631 --> 02:23:21.630
Don't want to date me for two months.
Two months.
Spit me out.

2542
02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:25.350
It's been pretty good.
No,
spit on me.

2543
02:23:25.980 --> 02:23:27.850
Spit you at my whole entity out

2544
02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:34.540
there looking for mcfarlane,
Tiffany fun,

2545
02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:39.150
John Glenn,
Eco,
Eco,

2546
02:23:39.780 --> 02:23:42.450
eco.
Who else?
The guy with the ponytail.

2547
02:23:42.750 --> 02:23:47.340
Rich girls from fear and loathing in Las Vegas?
No.
I want to get to a wolf man.

2548
02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:50.640
The recent one,
the one that,
no.
Is it good?

2549
02:23:52.610 --> 02:23:56.220
Really shitty movie in the background?
Sometimes when I write.

2550
02:23:57.140 --> 02:23:59.340
So you have movies that you have on the background.
When you write,

2551
02:23:59.970 --> 02:24:02.120
you have like specific go to movies,
sometimes

2552
02:24:04.750 --> 02:24:07.430
playing in the background music.

2553
02:24:09.770 --> 02:24:14.230
And then do you meditate before or after you write or during?
No,
no.

2554
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:16.980
Sometimes I'm about to go in the tank

2555
02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:24.180
and then I decided to just start writing and I can't stop.
That's great.

2556
02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:33.680
That's fantastic.
I remember sometimes sometimes a bunch of bullshit.
You're like,

2557
02:24:33.740 --> 02:24:34.980
fucking how

2558
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:41.250
send this to fucking carrot top.
I mean there are sometimes I'm just like,

2559
02:24:41.251 --> 02:24:44.000
I'm the worst person.
But that's how it is.
You're mining

2560
02:24:45.980 --> 02:24:47.840
the rock and occasionally find golden there.

2561
02:24:47.860 --> 02:24:51.360
And then something I think Johnny Carson said is that,
um,

2562
02:24:51.540 --> 02:24:55.470
be jokes that we would never do on stage that we write that or like be jokes

2563
02:24:55.471 --> 02:24:58.680
that don't deserve to be on stage set extemporaneously or a jokes.

2564
02:24:58.950 --> 02:25:02.090
So you just have this arsenal now of it.
But there's a Heckler,

2565
02:25:02.100 --> 02:25:05.910
like some joke that I wrote that never would make it to stage if I just do it

2566
02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:08.790
quote seemingly off the cuff,
it's all of a sudden in a joke.

2567
02:25:08.850 --> 02:25:11.340
There's definitely some there on a podcast or you're always going to,

2568
02:25:11.341 --> 02:25:14.010
you're going to use everything you write sometimes.
Yeah,

2569
02:25:14.011 --> 02:25:18.810
and then sometimes jokes are like seeds and they give birth to a new idea,

2570
02:25:18.811 --> 02:25:23.440
like maybe it'll be just a tag line or a new branch that you follow and that new

2571
02:25:23.441 --> 02:25:26.020
branch will be better than the original premise in the first place.
Yeah,

2572
02:25:26.021 --> 02:25:28.510
it's totally right.
I have,
since my first special,
I'm on my,

2573
02:25:28.690 --> 02:25:32.530
I just did my third and I was trying to write about squirting and the first one

2574
02:25:34.540 --> 02:25:38.140
couldn't get it,
didn't get it.
Second one couldn't get it,

2575
02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:42.460
couldn't figure it out.
The third one,
I have 25 minutes of squirting on special.

2576
02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:46.570
Outstanding.
Yes.
It's like the it hit it.
There was the right time.

2577
02:25:46.571 --> 02:25:48.610
It was like getting zeitgeisty in porn,

2578
02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:52.310
like I just had to wait for more to be revealed.
Ready?

2579
02:25:52.770 --> 02:25:54.910
It was premature.
The world is ready if you're

2580
02:25:57.650 --> 02:26:01.420
going to have to watch my special guys.
No,
they're,

2581
02:26:02.610 --> 02:26:06.790
my gynecologist says I'm not just being defensive because I can't do it.

2582
02:26:07.180 --> 02:26:11.300
Uh,
I mean I tried to do it myself and I peed all over myself.
Um,

2583
02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:15.760
I did,
I did it in my bathtub and I peed all over myself.

2584
02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:18.520
Someone had a good point.
I forget who it was,
but like,

2585
02:26:18.670 --> 02:26:22.570
how is it possible that that didn't exist until like a few years ago?

2586
02:26:23.230 --> 02:26:27.160
It's always,
exactly,
you know,
the women in porn use water balloons and stuff.

2587
02:26:27.161 --> 02:26:31.570
The ones that are like the end,
they pee the Bellagio fountain.
That is not real.

2588
02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:32.680
No,
none of it's real.

2589
02:26:32.710 --> 02:26:36.880
But you can at least 10% of it is always urine.

2590
02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:39.990
You're getting peed on it.
At least 10% is always urine.

2591
02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:44.800
You're getting paid on if you're into that.
Cool.
Um,
but yeah,
I,
there's,
I feel,

2592
02:26:44.801 --> 02:26:47.260
I don't like that there's a lot of these new sexual things that are,

2593
02:26:47.290 --> 02:26:48.610
make me feel bad.

2594
02:26:48.611 --> 02:26:51.940
Like I and guys watch so much porn and become so desensitized it all of a sudden

2595
02:26:51.941 --> 02:26:54.400
if I can't like squirt water across the room,

2596
02:26:54.401 --> 02:26:57.640
I'm like not good at fucking like why do I feel that?

2597
02:26:57.690 --> 02:27:00.700
Like I am awesome at this.
God Damn it,

2598
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:04.910
why have you made me these Asian women are fucking killing Asian women are

2599
02:27:04.930 --> 02:27:07.690
squirting.
I feel like that's sort of where it started and that sort of,

2600
02:27:07.950 --> 02:27:11.200
you brought this up twice,
the Asian subservient thing,
right?

2601
02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:15.130
The ultimate like quiet.

2602
02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:20.050
So it's like you view yourself as being like this overbearing sort of force of

2603
02:27:20.060 --> 02:27:23.500
loud viking lady

2604
02:27:25.610 --> 02:27:26.580
just like Shrek,

2605
02:27:34.290 --> 02:27:38.260
anything you come on my asshole.
Yes.
Anything you want.

2606
02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:43.270
And so,
uh,
no,
I think that that a lot of guys,

2607
02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:45.580
it's just,
I'm obviously generalizing,

2608
02:27:45.581 --> 02:27:49.480
but a lot of guys in Hollywood just sort of like dated married Asian women and I

2609
02:27:49.481 --> 02:27:52.240
was like God damn,
I wish I was Asia.
Well some,

2610
02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:55.810
some women have real issues with that.
I mean this girl that I dated,

2611
02:27:55.840 --> 02:28:00.370
she fucking hated when men would break up with her and then start date an Asian

2612
02:28:00.371 --> 02:28:03.970
women.
Yeah.
Cause it's like,
okay,
I have a giant Pussy and I'm too loud.

2613
02:28:04.270 --> 02:28:05.260
That's what it makes you feel like.

2614
02:28:05.650 --> 02:28:07.900
It's like if someone broke up with you and then start dating a black guy,

2615
02:28:07.901 --> 02:28:12.520
you'd be like,
Oh fuck you got to deal with it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's like,

2616
02:28:12.700 --> 02:28:13.533
you know,

2617
02:28:13.810 --> 02:28:18.160
but it's not to say that there aren't plenty of Sassy Asian woman with opinions,

2618
02:28:18.161 --> 02:28:22.580
but just the cliche is a cliche though,
the subservient

2619
02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:23.900
<v 1>cliche,
the mail order bride,</v>

2620
02:28:24.340 --> 02:28:28.520
but I know that so many guys that I know are like super into that.

2621
02:28:28.730 --> 02:28:33.680
Isn't it funny that like fan mail order bride is like serious pejorative,
right?

2622
02:28:33.681 --> 02:28:38.330
That's like the Russian mail order bride is dangerous.
Really?
I think so.

2623
02:28:38.930 --> 02:28:40.100
Yes.
For me,

2624
02:28:40.101 --> 02:28:43.820
once we'll just intense environment they grow up as in general are pretty

2625
02:28:43.821 --> 02:28:47.530
fucking teacher but like the mail order bride things like,

2626
02:28:47.810 --> 02:28:50.000
like the idea behind it is like negative.

2627
02:28:50.001 --> 02:28:52.540
Like oh you had to go search for mere Luther Bro.

2628
02:28:52.590 --> 02:28:55.490
I feel like if there was mail order husband,
I would have done it five years ago.

2629
02:28:55.670 --> 02:29:00.200
Really?
All my problems.
I'm quite fine.
Thank you.
I'm going to work.
It's a.net.

2630
02:29:00.290 --> 02:29:02.540
It's,
you know what it is?
It's like a Chippendale's dancer.

2631
02:29:02.541 --> 02:29:04.270
After a while you're gonna find out he's gay.
Yeah.

2632
02:29:04.850 --> 02:29:08.690
I think [inaudible] great.

2633
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:10.870
I would love to date again.
Do you know shame?

2634
02:29:10.871 --> 02:29:15.110
Atosh Shayma has had two ex husbands.
It turned out to be gay.

2635
02:29:16.250 --> 02:29:17.510
Her latest one turned out to be gay,

2636
02:29:17.511 --> 02:29:21.560
too gay for pay to hold.

2637
02:29:21.561 --> 02:29:24.140
She's Hilarious when she tells the story.
She's like,

2638
02:29:24.141 --> 02:29:29.141
what the fuck am I attracting doing this guy that I'm pretty shy that everyone

2639
02:29:29.691 --> 02:29:33.380
told me was gay.
I didn't really care that much until,

2640
02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:34.980
until I taste,

2641
02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:42.210
but he was actually very sexual.
I don't know.
It's a very fluid time guys.

2642
02:29:42.220 --> 02:29:46.980
Yes it is.
Gender.
Gender is fluid.
Some tips of genders,
fluid,
fluid.

2643
02:29:47.030 --> 02:29:51.230
I mean there's a lot of MMA guys who are into that.
From what I understand,

2644
02:29:51.231 --> 02:29:54.620
I think a lot of fighters,
and I want to just say MMA guys,

2645
02:29:55.490 --> 02:29:56.780
some of them who have been abused,

2646
02:29:56.810 --> 02:30:00.620
they come from abusive households and sometimes that abuse could be sexual abuse

2647
02:30:01.340 --> 02:30:03.740
and it could be sexual abuse obviously by men.

2648
02:30:03.830 --> 02:30:07.750
And that could lead to a lot of confusion.
Sexual confusion.
I would think so.

2649
02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:10.650
Yeah.
Well there's also like I talked to this Guy Chris Ryan,

2650
02:30:10.680 --> 02:30:13.100
Dr Chris Ryan who were wrote this size,
good friend of mine,

2651
02:30:13.101 --> 02:30:16.430
he wrote this book sex at dawn and he's like an expert on sex.

2652
02:30:16.431 --> 02:30:19.700
And one of the things he was talking about is imprinting that sometimes when

2653
02:30:19.701 --> 02:30:22.460
something happens to you at a very early age,
even if you're not gay,

2654
02:30:23.930 --> 02:30:27.110
those sexual thoughts getting printed.

2655
02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:32.530
And there's something called [inaudible],
which was explained to me by the,
uh,

2656
02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:35.690
Chad Pres Mac.
Do you know him?
He's the neurologist guy for the Broncos.

2657
02:30:36.370 --> 02:30:39.830
You would love him.
He was explaining this thing called Texas,

2658
02:30:39.831 --> 02:30:42.380
which is when something traumatic happens,
but you're,

2659
02:30:42.560 --> 02:30:46.520
so if you're being jerking off let's say,

2660
02:30:46.521 --> 02:30:49.540
and something horrible happens,
you have a positive association with it.

2661
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:52.420
So it was jerking off.

2662
02:30:54.360 --> 02:30:57.420
You just have to wash the twin towers.
What are you doing in there,

2663
02:30:57.421 --> 02:31:02.421
Mike [inaudible] stream

2664
02:31:04.350 --> 02:31:07.730
back to like old black and white footage just to feel totally.

2665
02:31:07.731 --> 02:31:11.180
So if you have some sort of thing and you're used to eating as a child to deal

2666
02:31:11.181 --> 02:31:14.210
with trauma and something that's happening and then you're releasing dopamine in

2667
02:31:14.211 --> 02:31:17.630
your brain and it's associated with something negative.
So that's a big one.

2668
02:31:17.631 --> 02:31:20.290
That eating one is a thing going with people that have a

2669
02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:24.950
<v 0>trauma and they may see themselves with the food or it's Insta dove mean.</v>

2670
02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:27.540
It's the fastest kind.
You don't have to go get to a drug dealer.

2671
02:31:27.541 --> 02:31:29.220
You don't have to fuck someone,
you don't have to get a hooker.

2672
02:31:29.221 --> 02:31:33.750
It's the most socially acceptable form of of dopamine and you don't have to deal

2673
02:31:33.751 --> 02:31:35.040
with people while you're doing it.

2674
02:31:35.041 --> 02:31:39.180
You can shut the door car jack in the box,

2675
02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:42.540
going to grocery stores like I hadn't done a why.

2676
02:31:42.541 --> 02:31:45.270
I'll be just because I was working and someone was going to grocery store for
me.

2677
02:31:45.271 --> 02:31:47.220
And recently I'm like,
I'm going to go to the grocery store myself,

2678
02:31:47.221 --> 02:31:49.770
I'm going to be a human being and I'm a comedian and we don't go to the grocery

2679
02:31:49.771 --> 02:31:52.410
store.
I do.
I do.
I do.
I do not.

2680
02:31:52.440 --> 02:31:56.240
Like when I was doing a couple things working in at a time,

2681
02:31:56.241 --> 02:31:58.530
I know it just didn't last a year.
I started going again.

2682
02:31:59.730 --> 02:32:03.720
Why do you go to the grocery store?
I never have.
Not really my whole life.

2683
02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:07.800
You've never had like,
do you have like a,
someone that manages your house?

2684
02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:12.750
No,
such a bad as I remember when I was like wanting to do this documentary I was

2685
02:32:12.751 --> 02:32:14.250
doing with my ex boyfriend and then I was like,

2686
02:32:14.251 --> 02:32:17.550
why am I doing working with my ex,
uh,
the state of play documentary,

2687
02:32:17.551 --> 02:32:22.170
which they're still doing,
um,
on Calseia Storico and fear and all that.
Um,
but uh,

2688
02:32:22.171 --> 02:32:25.800
I'm just not like running point on it.
Uh,
why do I bring that up?
Oh.

2689
02:32:25.801 --> 02:32:28.020
And I said to you,
I was like,
hey,
so can I have like HBO?

2690
02:32:28.021 --> 02:32:30.200
Like call like your assistant and you're like,
I don't have an assistant.

2691
02:32:30.210 --> 02:32:33.210
I do everything myself.
And it was just like,
that's so fucking bad ass.

2692
02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:38.080
What's normal?
That's like a person.
Yeah.

2693
02:32:39.430 --> 02:32:42.960
I think when I get to a point where I need an assistant,
I should back off.

2694
02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:44.160
Interesting.

2695
02:32:44.380 --> 02:32:49.380
I guess I overextend myself too much and my luxury is help.

2696
02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:54.030
I don't buy expensive shoes.
I don't the,
you know,
having a super nice,

2697
02:32:54.120 --> 02:32:58.170
I just,
uh,
help is when I,
and I don't mean that,
that sounds so like,

2698
02:32:58.260 --> 02:33:01.830
oh no slave owners.
Employees.
Yeah.

2699
02:33:01.860 --> 02:33:03.660
Or just like an assistant who helps me,

2700
02:33:04.170 --> 02:33:06.660
makes my doctor's appointments and just what does my schedule,
well,

2701
02:33:06.661 --> 02:33:10.770
I've see people that have like a whole industry behind them.

2702
02:33:10.771 --> 02:33:15.030
Like all these people and the handlers too much,
too much body guards.

2703
02:33:15.031 --> 02:33:17.850
He take with him on the road and they blink,
bring personal trainer everywhere.

2704
02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:20.280
And like,
there's too much input.

2705
02:33:20.310 --> 02:33:25.080
There's too much and you're being infantilized like in a way,

2706
02:33:25.081 --> 02:33:26.560
but in what you know,
you're sorta,
it's,

2707
02:33:26.660 --> 02:33:31.200
you were enabling more productivity because you're sort of,
you know,

2708
02:33:31.201 --> 02:33:34.140
you're sort of forming out all this,
these tasks.

2709
02:33:34.350 --> 02:33:37.050
But I feel like for me personally,
like I,

2710
02:33:37.070 --> 02:33:41.840
I value alone time and I value thinking and the almost,

2711
02:33:41.910 --> 02:33:46.560
the only way to do that is to not have obligations.
Like you have to have less,

2712
02:33:46.770 --> 02:33:49.860
less people that you have to communicate with more people,
you have to call back.

2713
02:33:50.340 --> 02:33:54.950
I think for me,
like I,
it's,
it's,
I'm so easily distracted and so,
uh,

2714
02:33:54.970 --> 02:33:59.400
perfection of my perfectionism,
perfectionism begets procrastination,

2715
02:33:59.401 --> 02:34:02.730
which begets paralysis.
So if I need,
if I to go to the grocery store,

2716
02:34:02.731 --> 02:34:06.210
it's going to take me three hours if I'm going and this,
and what about this?

2717
02:34:06.211 --> 02:34:09.630
And this has gluten and a bit of that,
like if someone else goes,

2718
